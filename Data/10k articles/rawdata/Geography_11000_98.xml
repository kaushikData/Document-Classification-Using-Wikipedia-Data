The '''A587''' is a road in [[England]] that runs from [[Blackpool]] to [[Fleetwood]] in [[Lancashire]].

The road runs a total distance of approximately {{convert|9|mi}}, largely on residential and commercial streets. It begins by the Oxford roundabout, in [[Marton, Blackpool|Marton]], in the south-eastern part of Blackpool {{nowrap|({{coord|53.8043|-3.0246|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A587 road (southern end)}}),}} as a turning off the [[A583 road|A583]], Preston New Road.  It continues north, as South Park Drive and later East Park Drive, past [[Stanley Park, Blackpool|Stanley Park]] and [[Blackpool Victoria Hospital]] for about {{convert|1.5|mi}}, until the Four Lane Ends roundabout. At this point, as St Walburga's Road, it continues north, and later becomes [[dual carriageway]] for {{convert|0.7|mi}}. After the Plymouth Road roundabout, it crosses the railway, and continues north as Bispham Road for a further {{convert|1.4|mi}} to Bispham roundabout, where it becomes Devonshire Road and then Fleetwood Road. {{convert|1.3|mi}} further on it is joined at Anchorsholme by the [[A584 road|A584]], the Queen's Promenade, and continues north through [[Cleveleys]] for {{convert|0.5|mi}} as a dual carriageway, named Fleetwood Road and Kelso Avenue for north and southbound traffic respectively, with the [[Blackpool tramway|tram]] tracks dividing the road. It then enters Cleveleys as it enters the Wyre District. Past Cleveleys, as a single lane road, now known as Rossall Road, it continues north for a further {{convert|1.5|mi}}, past [[Rossall School]] in a short 40mph section, and into Fleetwood, where it becomes Broadway.  The road crosses West View roundabout, and turns right down Poulton Road, eventually terminating at the new Ash Street roundabout, near Fleetwood Freeport {{nowrap|({{coord|53.9193|-3.0142|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A587 road (northern end)}}),}} where it joins to the [[A585 road|A585]].

'''Anatolia''' (from  [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἀνατολή}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Anatolḗ}}''; {{Lang-tr|Anadolu}} "east" or "[sun]rise"), also known as '''Asia Minor''' ([[Medieval Greek|Medieval]] and [[Modern Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Μικρά Ἀσία}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Mikrá Asía}}'', "small Asia"; {{Lang-tr|Küçük Asya}}), '''Asian Turkey''', the '''Anatolian peninsula''', or the '''Anatolian plateau''', is the westernmost protrusion of [[Asia]], which makes up the majority of modern-day [[Turkey]]. The region is bounded by the [[Black Sea]] to the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, the [[Armenian Plateau]] to the east, and the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west. The [[Sea of Marmara]] forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Dardanelles]] straits and separates Anatolia from [[Thrace]] on the [[Europe]]an mainland.

Traditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to a line between the [[Gulf of Alexandretta]] and the Black Sea to the [[Armenian Highlands]] (Armenia Major). This region is now named and largely situated in the [[Eastern Anatolia Region]] of the far north east of [[Turkey]] and converges with the [[Lesser Caucasus]] – an area that was incorporated in the [[Russian Empire]] region of [[Transcaucasia]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adalian|first=Rouben Paul|title=Historical dictionary of Armenia|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0810874504|pages=336–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QS-vSjHObOYC|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grierson|first=Otto Mørkholm ; edited by Philip|title=Early Hellenistic coinage : from the accession of Alexander to the Peace of Apamea (336–188 B.C.)|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521395046|page=175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_5Ez0kAOuIC|edition=Repr.|author2=Westermark, Ulla}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, traditionally Anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the Asian part of Turkey.

Anatolia is often considered to be synonymous with Asian Turkey, which comprises almost the entire country;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hooglund |first=Eric |article=Anatolia |work=Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa |date=2004 |via=Encyclopedia.com |chapter-url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Anatolia.aspx |quote="Anatolia comprises more than 95 percent of Turkey's total land area." |publisher=Macmillan/Gale }}&lt;/ref&gt; its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be the [[Turkey|Turkish]] borders with neighboring [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], and [[Syria]], in clockwise direction.

The [[Ancient Anatolians|ancient inhabitants of Anatolia]] spoke the now-extinct [[Anatolian languages]], which were largely replaced by the [[Greek language]] starting from [[classical antiquity]] and during the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] periods. Major Anatolian languages included [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Luwian language|Luwian]], and [[Lydian language|Lydian]] among other more poorly attested relatives. The [[Turkification]] of Anatolia began under the [[Seljuk Empire]] in the late 11th century and continued under the [[Ottoman Empire]] between the early 14th and early 20th centuries. However, various non-Turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in Anatolia today, including [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Aramaic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Arabic]], [[Laz language|Laz]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Other ancient peoples in the region included [[Galatians (people)|Galatians]], [[Hurrians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Hattians]], [[Cimmerian]]s, as well as [[Ionian Greeks|Ionian]], [[Dorian Greeks|Dorian]], and [[Aeolian Greek]]s.

The Anatolian [[peninsula]], also called Asia Minor, &lt;!-- Do not link to [[Asia Minor]] because it redirects to this page --&gt; is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west, and the Sea of Marmara to the northwest, which separates Anatolia from [[Thrace]] in Europe. The [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] defines it as "the peninsula of land that today constitutes the Asian portion of Turkey."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Anatolia - History, Map, &amp; Facts| work = Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate = 2018-11-23| url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to an indefinite line running from the [[Gulf of Alexandretta]] to the Black Sea, coterminous with the Anatolian Plateau. This traditional geographical definition is used, for example, in the latest edition of ''[[Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary]]'',&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary |last= |first= |year=2001 |isbn=0 87779 546 0 |page=46 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Co_VIPIJerIC&amp;pg=PA883&amp;dq=anatolia+geographical+dictionary#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |accessdate=18 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, Anatolia is bounded to the east by the [[Armenian Highlands]], and the [[Euphrates]] before that river bends to the southeast to enter [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;{{fails verification|date=November 2018}} To the southeast, it is bounded by the ranges that separate it from the Orontes valley in [[Syria (region)]] and the Mesopotamian plain.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

Following the [[Armenian Genocide]] and [[History of the Republic of Turkey|establishment of the Republic of Turkey]], the Armenian Highlands (or [[Western Armenia]]) [[Eastern Anatolia Region#Substitution with Armenia|were renamed "Eastern Anatolia"]] (literally ''The Eastern East'') by the Turkish government,&lt;ref name="Sahakyan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakyan|first=Lusine|title=Turkification of the Toponyms in the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey|year=2010|publisher=[[Arod Books]]|location=Montreal|isbn=978-0969987970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hovannisian|first1=Richard|title=The Armenian genocide cultural and ethical legacies|date=2007|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=1412835925|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3monyE4CVQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; being effectively co-terminous with Asian Turkey. Turkey's [[First Geography Congress, Turkey|First Geography Congress]] in 1941 created two [[geographical regions of Turkey|regions]] to the east of the Gulf of Iskenderun-Black Sea line named the [[Eastern Anatolia Region]] and the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]],&lt;ref name="Yigit"&gt;Ali Yiğit, "Geçmişten Günümüze Türkiye'yi Bölgelere Ayıran Çalışmalar ve Yapılması Gerekenler", ''Ankara Üniversitesi Türkiye Coğrafyası Araştırma ve Uygulama Merkezi, IV. Ulural Coğrafya Sempozyumu, "Avrupa Birliği Sürecindeki Türkiye'de Bölgesel Farklılıklar"'', [http://www.fka.org.tr/SayfaDownload/bildiri_nihan_atay.pdf pp. 34–35.]&lt;/ref&gt; the former largely corresponding to the western part of the Armenian Highland, the latter to the northern part of the Mesopotamian plain. Vazken Davidian terms the expanded use of "Anatolia" to apply to territory formerly referred to as Armenia as "an historical imposition", and notes that a growing body of literature is uncomfortable with referring to the Ottoman East as "Eastern Anatolia".&lt;ref&gt;Vazken Khatchig Davidian, "Imagining Ottoman Armenia: Realism and Allegory in Garabed Nichanian's Provincial Wedding in Moush and Late Ottoman Art Criticism", p7 &amp; footnote 34, in ''Études arméniennes contemporaines'' volume 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Onomastics and etymology==
The oldest known reference to Anatolia – as “Land of the [[Hittites|Hatti]]” – appears on [[Mesopotamia]]n [[cuneiform]] tablets from the period of the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2350–2150 BC).{{citation needed|date= October 2012}} The first recorded name the Greeks used for the Anatolian peninsula, Ἀσία ([[:wikt:Asia|Asía]]),&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa Ἀσία], ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; presumably echoed the name of the [[Assuwa league]] in western Anatolia.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} As the name "Asia" broadened its scope to apply to other areas east of the Mediterranean, Greeks in [[Late Antiquity]] came to use the name Μικρὰ Ἀσία (''Mikrá Asía'') or Asia Minor, meaning "Lesser Asia" to refer to present-day Anatolia.

The English-language name ''Anatolia'' itself derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνατολή}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|anatolḗ}}'') meaning “the East” or more literally “sunrise” (comparable to the Latin-derived terms "[[levant]]" and "[[orient]]").&lt;ref name="etym"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%237638 | author= Henry George Liddell |author2= Robert Scott| title= A Greek-English Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anatolia |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise reference of this term has varied over time, perhaps originally referring to the [[Aeolians|Aeolian]], [[Ionians|Ionian]] and [[Dorians|Dorian]] colonies on the west coast of Asia Minor. In the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Anatolic Theme]] (Ἀνατολικόν θέμα) was a ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]'' covering the western and central parts of Turkey's present-day [[Central Anatolia Region]].&lt;ref name="First Thema 1952, p. 59"&gt;"On the First Thema, called Anatolikón. This theme is called Anatolikón or Theme of the Anatolics, not because it is above and in the direction of the east where the sun rises, but because it lies to the East of Byzantium and Europe."

The term "Anatolia" is [[Medieval Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/anatolia Anatolia - Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Turkish form of Anatolia, ''Anadolu'', derives from the Greek name Aνατολή (''Anatolḗ''). The Russian male name [[Anatoly]] and the French [[Anatole (disambiguation)|Anatole]] share the same linguistic origin.

In English the name of ''[[Name of Turkey|Turkey]]'' for ancient Anatolia first appeared c. 1369. It derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''Turchia'' (meaning “Land of the Turks”, Turkish ''Türkiye''), a name originally used by Europeans to designate those parts of Anatolia controlled by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum]] after the [[Battle of Manzikert]] (1071).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Ancient Near East (Bronze and Iron Ages)===

====Hattians and Hurrians====
The earliest historical records of Anatolia stem from the southeast of the region and are from the [[Mesopotamia]]n-based [[Akkadian Empire]] during the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]] in the 24th century BC. Scholars generally believe the earliest indigenous populations of Anatolia were the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]]. The Hattians spoke a [[Hattic language|language]] of unclear affiliation, and the [[Hurrian language]] belongs to a small family called [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian]], all these languages now being extinct; relationships with indigenous [[languages of the Caucasus]] have been proposed&lt;ref&gt;Bryce 2005:12&lt;/ref&gt; but are not generally accepted. The region was famous for exporting raw materials, and areas of [[Hittite empire|Hattian]]- and Hurrian-populated southeast Anatolia were colonised by the Akkadians.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

====Assyrian Empire (21st–18th centuries BC)====
After the fall of the [[Akkadian Empire]] in the mid-21st century BC, the Assyrians, who were the northern branch of the Akkadian people, colonised parts of the region between the 21st and mid-18th centuries BC and claimed its resources, notably [[silver]]. One of the numerous cuneiform records dated circa 20th century BC, found in Anatolia at the Assyrian colony of [[Kültepe|Kanesh]], uses an advanced system of trading computations and credit lines.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Charles|title= Egypt, Greece and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999|isbn=0-19-872194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hittite Kingdom and Empire (17th–12th centuries BC)====
{{main|History of the Hittites}}
[[File:Lion Gate, Hattusa 01.jpg|thumb|The Lion Gate at [[Hattusa]], capital of the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]]. The city's history dates to before 2000 BC.]]
Unlike the Akkadians and their descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Hittites]] were centred at [[Hattusa]] (modern Boğazkale) in north-central Anatolia by the 17th century BC. They were speakers of an Indo-European language, the [[Hittite language]], or ''nesili'' (the language of Nesa) in Hittite. The Hittites originated of local ancient cultures that grew in Anatolia, in addition to the arrival of Indo-European languages. Attested for the first time in the Assyrian tablets of [[Kültepe|Nesa]] around 2000BC, they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations. According to the widely accepted [[Kurgan theory]] on the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]], however, the Hittites (along with the other Indo-European [[ancient Anatolians]]) were themselves relatively recent [[Indo-European migrations|immigrants]] to Anatolia from the north. However, they did not necessarily displace the population genetically, they would rather assimilate into the former peoples' culture, preserving the Hittite language however.

The Hittites adopted the [[cuneiform script]], invented in Mesopotamia. During the Late Bronze Age circa 1650 BC, they created a kingdom, the [[Hittites#New Kingdom|Hittite New Kingdom]], which became an empire in the 14th century BC after the conquest of [[Kizzuwatna]] in the south-east and the defeat of the [[Assuwa league]] in western Anatolia. The empire reached its height in the 13th century BC, controlling much of Asia Minor, northwestern [[Syria]] and northwest upper Mesopotamia. They failed to reach the Anatolian coasts of the Black Sea, however, as a non-Indo-European people, the semi-nomadic pastoralist and tribal [[Kaskians]], had established themselves there, displacing earlier [[Palaic language|Palaic-speaking]] Indo-Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Carruba, O. ''Das Palaische. Texte, Grammatik, Lexikon''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1970. StBoT 10&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the history of the Hittite Empire concerned war with the rival empires of [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]] and the [[Mitanni]].&lt;ref name="Roux"&gt;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egyptians]] eventually withdrew from the region after failing to gain the upper hand over the Hittites and becoming wary of the power of Assyria, which had destroyed the Mitanni Empire.&lt;ref name="Roux"/&gt; The Assyrians and Hittites were then left to battle over control of eastern and southern Anatolia and colonial territories in [[Syria]]. The Assyrians had better success than the Egyptians, annexing much Hittite (and Hurrian) territory in these regions.&lt;ref name="Georges Roux 1966"&gt;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq. Penguin Books, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neo-Hittite kingdoms (c. 1180–700 BC)====
After 1180 BC, during the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]], the Hittite empire disintegrated into several independent [[Syro-Hittite states]], subsequent to losing much territory to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] and being finally overrun by the [[Phrygians]], another Indo-European people who are believed to have migrated from the [[Balkans]]. The Phrygian expansion into southeast Anatolia was eventually halted by the Assyrians, who controlled that region.&lt;ref name="Georges Roux 1966"/&gt;

:'''Arameans'''
'''[[Arameans]]''' encroached over the borders of south central Anatolia in the century or so after the fall of the Hittite empire, and some of the Syro-Hittite states in this region became an amalgam of Hittites and Arameans. These became known as [[Syro-Hittite states]].

:'''Luwians'''
[[File:Dalyan - Caunos2.JPG|right|thumb|Lycian rock cut tombs of [[Kaunos]] (Dalyan)]]
In central and western Anatolia, another Indo-European people, the [[Luwian language|Luwians]], came to the fore, circa 2000 BC. Their language was closely related to [[Hittite language|Hittite]].&lt;ref&gt;Melchert 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The general consensus amongst scholars is that Luwian was spoken—to a greater or lesser degree—across a large area of western Anatolia, including (possibly) [[Wilusa]] ([[Troy]]), the Seha River Land (to be identified with the [[Gediz River|Hermos]] and/or [[Bakırçay|Kaikos]] valley), and the kingdom of Mira-Kuwaliya with its core territory of the Maeander valley.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 1994; id. 1995:144–51; Starke 1997; Melchert 2003; for the geography Hawkins 1998&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th century BC, Luwian regions coalesced into a number of states such as [[Lydia]], [[Caria]] and [[Lycia]], all of which had [[Greece|Hellenic]] influence.

====Neo-Assyrian Empire (10th–7th centuries BC)====
From the 10th to late 7th centuries BC, much of Anatolia (particularly the east, central, and southeastern regions) fell to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], including all of the [[Syro-Hittite states]], [[Tabal]], [[Kingdom of Commagene]], the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] and swathes of [[Cappadocia]].

The Neo-Assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], Scythians and their own [[Babylonia]]n relations. The last Assyrian city to fall was [[Harran]] in southeast Anatolia. This city was the birthplace of the last king of [[Babylon]], the Assyrian [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]]. Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based [[Medes|Median Empire]], with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory.

====Cimmerian and Scythian invasions (8th–7th centuries BC)====
From the late 8th century BC, a new wave of Indo-European-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast Anatolia: the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]]. The Cimmerians overran [[Phrygia]] and the Scythians threatened to do the same to Urartu and [[Lydia]], before both were finally checked by the Assyrians.

====Greek West====
[[File:Achaemenid Satrap Asia Minor end of 6th century BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of an [[Achaemenid]] Satrap of [[Asia Minor]] ([[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]], in [[Bithynia]]), end of 6th century BCE, probably under Darius I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=CAHN |first1=HERBERT A. |last2=GERIN |first2=DOMINIQUE |title=Themistocles at Magnesia |date=1988 |pages=20 &amp; Plate 3 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42668124}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The north-western coast of Anatolia was inhabited by Greeks of the [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaean]]/[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] culture from the 20th century BC, related to the Greeks of south eastern Europe and the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Bronze Age collapse]] at the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the west coast of Anatolia was settled by [[Ionian Greeks]], usurping the area of the related but earlier [[Mycenaean Greeks]]. Over several centuries, numerous Ancient Greek [[city-state]]s were established on the coasts of Anatolia. Greeks started Western philosophy on the western coast of Anatolia ([[Pre-Socratic philosophy]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Classical Antiquity===

In classical antiquity, Anatolia was described by [[Herodotus]] and later historians as divided into regions named after tribes such as [[Lydia]], [[Lycia]], [[Caria]], [[Mysia]], [[Bithynia]], [[Phrygia]], [[Galatia]], [[Lycaonia]], [[Pisidia]], [[Paphlagonia]], [[Cilicia]], and [[Cappadocia]]. By that time, the populations were a mixture of the ancient Anatolian or "[[Syro-Hittite]]" substrate and post-Bronze-Age-collapse "Thraco-Phrygian" and more recent Greco-Macedonian incursions.

[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Dying Gaul|Dying Galatian]]'' was a famous statue commissioned some time between [[Hellenistic period|230–220 BC]] by King [[Attalus I|Attalos I]] of [[Pergamon]] to honor his victory over the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Galatia]]ns in Anatolia.]]

Anatolia is known as the birthplace of minted [[coin]]age (as opposed to unminted coinage, which first appears in [[Mesopotamia]] at a much earlier date) as a medium of exchange, some time in the 7th century BC in Lydia. The use of minted coins continued to flourish during the [[Hellenistic period|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0-415-08992-1|last=Howgego|first=C.

During the 6th century BC, all of Anatolia was conquered by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]], the Persians having usurped the [[Medes]] as the dominant dynasty in [[Iran]]. In 499 BC, the Ionian city-states on the west coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule. The [[Ionian Revolt]], as it became known, though quelled, initiated the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], which ended in a Greek victory in 449 BC, and the Ionian cities regained their independence, alongside the withdrawal of the Persian forces from their European territories.

In 334 BC, the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Greek king [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the peninsula from the Achaemenid Persian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roisman|first1=Joseph|last2=Worthington|first2=Ian|title=A Companion to Ancient Macedonia|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2010|isbn=1-4051-7936-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lkYFVJ3U-BIC|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's conquest opened up the interior of Asia Minor to Greek settlement and influence.

[[File:Nemrut Dağı 12.jpg|thumb|Sanctuary of [[Commagene]] Kings on [[Mount Nemrut]] (1st century BC)]]
Following the death of Alexander and the breakup of his empire, Anatolia was ruled by a series of Hellenistic kingdoms, such as the [[Attalid dynasty|Attalids of Pergamum]] and the [[Seleucids]], the latter controlling most of Anatolia. A period of peaceful [[Hellenization]] followed, such that the local Anatolian languages had been supplanted by Greek by the 1st century BC. In 133 BC the last Attalid king bequeathed his kingdom to the [[Roman Republic]], and western and central Anatolia came under [[Roman Republic|Roman]] control, but [[Hellenistic culture]] remained predominant. Further annexations by Rome, in particular of the [[Kingdom of Pontus]] by [[Pompey]], brought all of Anatolia under Roman control, except for the eastern frontier with the [[Parthian Empire]], which remained unstable for centuries, causing a series of wars, culminating in the [[Roman-Parthian Wars]].

===Early Christian Period===
After the division of the Roman Empire, Anatolia became part of the East Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire]]. Anatolia was one of the first places where Christianity spread, so that by the 4th century AD, western and central Anatolia were overwhelmingly Christian and Greek-speaking. For the next 600 years, while Imperial possessions in Europe were subjected to barbarian invasions, Anatolia would be the center of the Hellenic world. Byzantine control was challenged by [[Arabs|Arab]] raids starting in the eighth century (see [[Arab–Byzantine wars]]), but in the ninth and tenth century a resurgent Byzantine Empire regained its lost territories, including even long lost territory such as [[Armenia]] and [[Syria]] (ancient [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]).

===Late Medieval Period===
[[File:Asia Minor ca 842 AD.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Byzantine Anatolia]] and the Byzantine-Arab frontier zone in the mid-9th century]]
[[File:Anatolia1300.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Beyliks and other states around Anatolia, c. 1300.]]

In the 10 years following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the [[Seljuk Turks]] from [[Central Asia]] migrated over large areas of Anatolia, with particular concentrations around the northwestern rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Byzantine Empire 1025–1204 |last=Angold |first=Michael |year=1997 |isbn=0-582-29468-1 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish language and the Islamic religion were gradually introduced as a result of the Seljuk conquest, and this period marks the start of Anatolia's slow transition from predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking, to predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking (although ethnic groups such as Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians remained numerous and retained Christianity and their native languages). In the following century, the Byzantines managed to reassert their control in western and northern Anatolia. Control of Anatolia was then split between the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk [[Sultanate of Rûm]], with the Byzantine holdings gradually being reduced.&lt;ref name=Balyuzi/&gt;

In 1255, the [[Mongols]] swept through eastern and central Anatolia, and would remain until 1335. The [[Ilkhanate]] garrison was stationed near [[Ankara]].&lt;ref name=Balyuzi&gt;H. M. Balyuzi ''Muḥammad and the course of Islám'', p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Freely ''Storm on Horseback: The Seljuk Warriors of Turkey'', p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; After the decline of the Ilkhanate from 1335–1353, the [[Mongol Empire]]'s legacy in the region was the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] [[Eretna Dynasty]] that was overthrown by [[Kadi Burhan al-Din]] in 1381.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Edmund Bosworth-The new Islamic dynasties: a chronological and genealogical manual, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 14th century, most of Anatolia was controlled by various [[Anatolian beyliks]]. Smyrna fell in 1330, and the last Byzantine stronghold in Anatolia, Philadelphia, fell in 1390. The [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] Beyliks were under the control of the Mongols, at least nominally, through declining Seljuk sultans.&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Fuat Köprülü, Gary Leiser-The origins of the Ottoman Empire, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Partner ''God of battles: holy wars of Christianity and Islam'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The Beyliks did not mint coins in the names of their own leaders while they remained under the suzerainty of the [[Mongol]] [[Ilkhanids]].&lt;ref&gt;''Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Osmanli]] ruler [[Osman I]] was the first Turkish ruler who minted coins in his own name in 1320s, for it bears the legend "Minted by Osman son of Ertugul".&lt;ref&gt;Artuk - O''smanli Beyliginin Kurucusu'', 27f&lt;/ref&gt; Since the minting of coins was a prerogative accorded in Islamic practice only to a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]], it can be considered that the Osmanli, or Ottoman Turks, became formally independent from the Mongol Khans.&lt;ref&gt;Pamuk - ''A Monetary History'', pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] leaders, the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottomans]] emerged as great power under [[Osman I]] and his son [[Orhan I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Osman-I|title=Osman I {{!}} Ottoman sultan|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Orhan|title=Orhan {{!}} Ottoman sultan|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anatolian [[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]] were successively absorbed into the rising [[Ottoman Empire]] during the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/new-cambridge-history-of-islam/rise-of-the-ottomans/015D10BC98EA8A2D69B29D54AC7241CC|title=The rise of the Ottomans (Chapter 11) - The New Cambridge History of Islam|last=Fleet|first=Kate|date=|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not well understood how the Osmanlı, or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], came to dominate their neighbours, as the history of medieval Anatolia is still little known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finkel|first=Caroline|title=Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cTHyUQoTyUC&amp;pg=PA5 |year=2007 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-00850-6 |page=5 |accessdate=6 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans completed the conquest of the peninsula in 1517 with the taking of [[Halicarnassus]] (modern [[Bodrum]]) from the [[Knights of Saint John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/halicarnassus|title=HALICARNASSUS – Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
[[File:Ethnicturkey1911.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Ethnographic map of Anatolia from 1911.]]

With the acceleration of the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, and as a result of the expansionist policies of the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Caucasus]], many Muslim nations and groups in that region, mainly [[Circassians]], [[Tatars]], [[Azeris]], [[Lezgian people|Lezgis]], [[Chechens]] and several [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups left their homelands and settled in Anatolia. As the Ottoman Empire further shrank in the [[Balkan]] regions and then fragmented during the [[Balkan Wars]], much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly Balkan Muslims (Bosnian Muslims, [[Albanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Pomaks|Muslim Bulgarians]] and [[Greek Muslims]] such as the [[Vallahades]] from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]), were resettled in various parts of Anatolia, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.

A continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century, when Greeks from Anatolia, [[Constantinople]] and Pontus area migrated toward the newly independent Kingdom of Greece, and also towards the United States, southern part of the Russian Empire, Latin America and rest of Europe.

Following the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) and the incorporation of the Eastern Armenia into the Russian Empire, another migration involved the large Armenian population of Anatolia, which recorded significant migration rates from Western Armenia (Eastern Anatolia) toward the Russian Empire, especially toward its newly established Armenian provinces.

Anatolia remained [[multi-ethnic]] until the early 20th century (see the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). During World War I, the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Greek genocide]] (especially in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]), and the [[Assyrian genocide]] almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] populations in Anatolia and surrounding regions. Following the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922]], most remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Many more have left Turkey since, leaving fewer than 5,000 Greeks in Anatolia today. Since the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, Anatolia has been within Turkey, its inhabitants being mainly Turks and Kurds (see [[demographics of Turkey]] and [[history of Turkey]]).

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Turkey}}

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of Turkey}}
Anatolia's terrain is structurally complex. A central [[massif]] composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded [[Trough (geology)|troughs]], covered by recent [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea coasts. Flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the [[Kızıl River]], the coastal plains of [[Çukurova]] and the valley floors of the [[Gediz River]] and the [[Büyük Menderes River]] as well as some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around [[Lake Tuz]] (Salt Lake) and the [[Konya]] Basin (''Konya Ovasi'').

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Anatolia has a varied range of climates. The central plateau is characterized by a continental climate, with hot summers and cold snowy winters. The south and west coasts enjoy a typical Mediterranean climate, with mild rainy winters, and warm dry summers.&lt;ref name=Prothero19&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=W.G.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/19/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Sea and Marmara coasts have a temperate oceanic climate, with cool foggy summers and much rainfall throughout the year.

===Ecoregions===
There is a diverse number of plant and animal communities.

The mountains and coastal plain of northern Anatolia experiences humid and mild climate. There are [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|temperate broadleaf, mixed]] and [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]] forests. The central and eastern plateau, with its drier [[continental climate]], has deciduous forests and forest steppes. Western and southern Anatolia, which have a [[Mediterranean climate]], contain [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] ecoregions.

Ctesiphon served as a royal capital of the [[Persian Empire]] in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian]] eras for over eight hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.freersackler.si.edu/events/films/?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D128600412|title=Ctesiphon: An Ancient Royal Capital in Context |last=|first= |date= September 15, 2018|work=Smithsonian |accessdate=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ctesiphon remained the capital of the Sasanian Empire until the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in 651 AD.

Ctesiphon developed into a rich commercial metropolis, merging with the surrounding cities along both shores of the river, including the Hellenistic city of [[Seleucia]]. Ctesiphon and its environs were therefore sometimes referred to as "The Cities" ([[Aramaic]]: ''Mahuza'', {{lang-ar|المدائن}}, ''[[al-Mada'in]]''). In the late sixth and early seventh century, it was one of the [[largest cities throughout history|largest cities in the world]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm|title=Largest Cities Through History|publisher=geography.about.com|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Roman–Parthian Wars]], Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans, and later fell twice during Sasanian rule. It was also the site of the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (363)|Battle of Ctesiphon in 363]] AD. After the Muslim invasion the city fell into decay and was depopulated by the end of the eighth century, its place as a political and economic center taken by the [[Abbasid]] capital at [[Baghdad]]. The most conspicuous structure remaining today is the [[Taq Kasra]], sometimes called the Archway of Ctesiphon.&lt;ref&gt;''Eventually no less than four Sasanian rulers were quoted as its builders: Shapur I (241–273), Shapur II (310–379), Chosroes I Anushirvan (531–579) and Chosroes II Parvez (590–628).'' {{Cite journal|author=Kurz, Otto|year=1941|title=The Date of the Ṭāq i Kisrā|journal=[[The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]] | series =  (New Series)|volume=73|number=1|pages=37–41|jstor= 25221709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names ==
The Latin name ''{{lang|la|Ctesiphon}}'' derives from [[Ancient Greek]] ''{{transl|grc|Ktēsiphôn}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:Κτησιφῶν|Κτησιφῶν]]}}) is ostensibly a Greek toponym based on a personal name, although it may be a Hellenized form of a local name, reconstructed as ''Tisfōn'' or ''Tisbōn''.&lt;ref&gt;''E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam 1913–1936'', Vol. 2 (Brill, 1987: {{ISBN|90-04-08265-4}}), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In Iranian-language texts of the Sasanian era, it is spelled as ''tyspwn'', which can be read as ''Tīsfōn'', ''Tēsifōn'', etc. in [[Manichean alphabet|Manichaean]] [[Parthian language|Parthian]], in [[Middle Persian]] and in Christian [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] (in [[Syriac alphabet]]) languages. The [[New Persian]] form is ''Tisfun'' ({{lang|fa|تیسفون}}).

Texts from the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]'s synods referred to the city as ''{{transl|syc|Qṭēspōn}}'' ({{lang-syr|ܩܛܝܣܦܘܢ}}) or some times ''{{transl|syc|Māḥôzē}}'' ({{lang-syr|ܡܚܘܙ̈ܐ}}) when referring to the metropolis of [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]].

In modern Arabic, the name is usually ''Ṭaysafūn'' ({{lang|ar|طيسفون}}) or ''Qaṭaysfūn'' ({{lang|ar|قطيسفون}}) or as ''al-Mada'in'' ({{lang|ar|المدائن}} "The Cities", referring to Greater Ctesiphon). "According to [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yāqūt]] [...], quoting Ḥamza, the original form was Ṭūsfūn or Tūsfūn, which was arabicized as Ṭaysafūn."&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;{{citation|last=Kröger|first=Jens|chapter=Ctesiphon|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=6|year=1993|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|chapter-url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v6f4/v6f4a030.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116013710/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v6f4/v6f4a030.html|archivedate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian name of the city was ''Tizbon'' ({{lang|hy|[[wikt:Տիզբոն|Տիզբոն]]}}). Ctesiphon is first mentioned in the [[Book of Ezra]]&lt;ref&gt;Ezra 8:17&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Old Testament]] as Kasfia/Casphia (a derivative of the ethnic name, [[Cas (people)|Cas]], and a cognate of [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Qazvin]]).

== Location ==
[[Image:ctesiphon-ruin 1864.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Taq Kasra]] or Ctesiphon palace ruin, with the arch in the centre, 1864]]
Ctesiphon is located approximately at [[Al-Mada'in]], {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}} southeast of the modern city of [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], along the river Tigris. Ctesiphon measured 30 square kilometers, more than twice the surface of 13.7-square-kilometer fourth-century imperial [[Rome]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The [[Taq Kasra|archway of Chosroes]] (''Taq Kasra'') was once a part of the royal palace in Ctesiphon and is estimated to date between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Farrokh, K. (2007). The rise of Ctesiphon and the Silk Route. In Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War (p. 240).&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in what is now the Iraqi town of [[Salman Pak]].

== History ==

===Parthian period===
Ctesiphon was founded in the late 120s BC. It was built on the site of a military camp established across from Seleucia by [[Mithridates I of Parthia]]. The reign of [[Gotarzes I]] saw Ctesiphon reach a peak as a political and commercial center. The city became the Empire's capital circa 58&amp;nbsp;BC during the reign of [[Orodes II]]. Gradually, the city merged with the old [[Hellenistic]] capital of Seleucia and other nearby settlements to form a cosmopolitan metropolis.&lt;ref name="Farrokh, K. 2007 p. 125"&gt;Farrokh, K. (2007). The rise of Ctesiphon and the Silk Route. In Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War (p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for this westward relocation of the capital could have been in part due to the proximity of the previous capitals ([[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Mithradatkirt]], and [[Hecatompylos]] at [[Hyrcania]]) to the [[Scythian]] incursions.&lt;ref name="Farrokh, K. 2007 p. 125"/&gt;

[[Strabo]] abundantly describes the foundation of Ctesiphon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ancient times [[Babylon]] was the metropolis of [[Assyria]]; but now [[Seleucia]] is the metropolis, I mean the [[Seleucia on the Tigris]], as it is called. Nearby is situated a village called Ctesiphon, a large village. This village the kings of the Parthians were wont to make their winter residence, thus sparing the Seleucians, in order that the Seleucians might not be oppressed by having the [[Scythians|Scythian]] folk or soldiery quartered amongst them. Because of the Parthian power, therefore, Ctesiphon is a city rather than a village; its size is such that it lodges a great number of people, and it has been equipped with buildings by the Parthians themselves; and it has been provided by the Parthians with wares for sale and with the arts that are pleasing to the Parthians; for the Parthian kings are accustomed to spend the winter there because of the salubrity of the air, but they summer at [[Ecbatana]] and in [[Hyrcania]] because of the prevalence of their ancient renown.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16A*.html |title=LacusCurtius • Strabo's Geography — Book XVI Chapter 1, 16 |publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of its importance, Ctesiphon was a major military objective for the leaders of the [[Roman Empire]] in their eastern wars. The city was captured by Rome five times in its history – three times in the 2nd century alone. The emperor [[Trajan]] captured Ctesiphon in 116, but his successor, [[Hadrian]], decided to willingly return Ctesiphon in 117 as part of a peace settlement. The Roman general [[Avidius Cassius]] captured Ctesiphon in 164 during another Parthian war, but abandoned it when peace was concluded. In 197, the emperor [[Septimius Severus]] sacked Ctesiphon and carried off thousands of its inhabitants, whom he sold into slavery.

===Sasanian period===
[[File:Southwestern part of the Sasanian Empire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Map of [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] [[Mesopotamia]] and its surroundings.]]
By 226, Ctesiphon was in the hands of the [[Sasanian Empire]], who also made it their capital and had laid an end to the Parthian dynasty of Iran. Ctesiphon was greatly enlarged and flourished during their rule, thus turning into a metropolis, which was known by in Arabic as [[al-Mada'in]], and in [[Aramaic]] as Mahoze.{{sfn|Morony|2009}} The oldest inhabited places of Ctesiphon were on its eastern side, which in [[Arabic]] sources is called "the Old City", where the residence of the Sasanians, known as the White Palace, was located. The southern side of Ctesiphon was known as Aspanbar, which was known by its prominent halls, riches, games, stables, and baths.{{sfn|Morony|2009}}

The western side was known as [[Veh-Ardashir]] (meaning "the good city of Ardashir" in [[Middle Persian]]), known as Mahoza by the [[Jews]], Kokhe by the Christians, and Behrasir by the Arabs. Veh-Ardashir was populated by many wealthy Jews, and was the seat of the church of the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Nestorian patriarch]]. To the south of Veh-Ardashir was [[Valashabad]].{{sfn|Morony|2009}} Ctesiphon had several other districts which were named Hanbu Shapur, Darzanidan, Veh Jondiu-Khosrow, Nawinabad and Kardakadh.{{sfn|Morony|2009}}

[[Severus Alexander]] advanced towards Ctesiphon in 233, but as corroborated by [[Herodian]], his armies suffered a humiliating defeat against [[Ardashir I]].&lt;ref&gt;Farrokh, K. (2007). The rise of Ctesiphon and the Silk Route. In Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War (p. 185).&lt;/ref&gt; In 283, emperor [[Carus]] sacked the city uncontested during a period of civil upheaval. In 295, emperor [[Galerius]] was defeated outside the city. However, he returned a year later with a vengeance and won a victory which ended in the fifth and final capture of the city by the Romans in 299. He returned it to the Persian king [[Narseh of Persia|Narses]] in exchange for [[Armenia]] and western Mesopotamia. In c.325 and again in 410, the city, or the Greek colony directly across the river, was the site of church councils for the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Church of the East]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
[[File:Babylon&amp;Seleuicia1(Peutinger Map).png|thumb|left|4th century Ctesiphon ([[Peutinger Map]])]]

After the conquest of Antioch in 541, [[Khosrau I]] built a new city near Ctesiphon for the inhabitants he captured. He called this new city ''Weh Antiok Khusrau'', or literally, "better than Antioch Khosrau built this."&lt;ref&gt;Dingas, Winter 2007, 109&lt;/ref&gt; Local inhabitants of the area called the new city ''Rumagan'', meaning "town of the Romans" and Arabs called the city ''al-Rumiyya''. Along with Weh Antiok, Khosrau built a number of fortified cities.&lt;ref name="frye"&gt;Frye 1993, 259&lt;/ref&gt; Khosrau I deported 292,000 citizens, slaves, and conquered people to the new city of Ctesiphon in 542.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Christensen |first= |title=The Decline of Iranshahr: Irrigation and Environments in the History of the Middle East, 500 B.C. to A.D. 1500 |location=Copenhagen |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |year=1993 |isbn=87-7289-259-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 590, a member of the [[House of Mihran]], [[Bahram Chobin]] repelled the newly ascended Sasanian ruler [[Khosrau II]] from Iraq, and conquered the region. One year later, Khosrau II, with aid from the [[Byzantine Empire]], reconquered his domains. During his reign, some of the great fame of al-Mada'in decreased, due to the popularity of Khosrau's new winter residence, Dastagerd.{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|2005}} In 627, the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] surrounded the city, the capital of the Sassanid Empire, leaving it after the Persians accepted his peace terms. In 628, a deadly plague hit Ctesiphon, al-Mada'in and the rest of the western part of the Sasanian Empire, which even killed Khosrau's son and successor, [[Kavadh II]].{{sfn|Shapur Shahbazi|2005}}

In 629, Ctesiphon was briefly under the control of Mihranid usurper [[Shahrbaraz]], but the latter was shortly assassinated by the supporters of Khosrau II's daughter [[Borandukht]]. Ctesiphon then continued to be involved in constant fighting between two factions of the Sasanian Empire, the Pahlav (Parthian) faction under the [[House of Ispahbudhan]] and the Parsig (Persian) faction under [[Piruz Khosrow]].

===Downfall of the Sasanians and the Islamic conquests===
In 636, the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim Arabs]], who had since 633 invaded the territories of the Sasanian Empire, defeated them during a great battle known as the [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah]]. The Arabs then attacked Ctesiphon, and occupied it in [[Siege of Ctesiphon (637)|early 637]].{{sfn|Morony|2009}}

The Muslim military officer [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas]] quickly seized [[Valashabad]] and made a peace treaty with the inhabitants of [[Weh Antiok Khusrau]] and [[Veh-Ardashir]]. The terms of the treaty were that the inhabitants of Weh Antiok Khusrau were allowed to leave if they wanted to, but if they did not, they were forced to acknowledge Muslim authority, and also pay tribute (''[[jizya]]''). Later on, when the Muslims arrived at Ctesiphon, it was completely desolated, due to flight of the [[Sasanian family tree|Sasanian royal family]], [[nobility|nobles]], and troops. However, the Muslims had managed to take some of troops captive, and many riches were seized from the Sasanian treasury and were given to the Muslim troops.{{sfn|Morony|2009}} Furthermore, the throne hall in [[Taq Kasra]] was briefly used as a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Dr Julian (1999). Scarre, Chris, ed. The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient world The Great Monuments and How they were Built. Thames &amp; Hudson. pp. 185–186. {{ISBN|0-500-05096-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, as political and economic fortune had passed elsewhere, the city went into a rapid decline, especially after the founding of the [[Abbasid]] capital at [[Baghdad]] in the 8th century, and soon became a [[ghost town]]. [[al-Mansur|Caliph Al-Mansur]] took much of the required material for the construction of Baghdad from the ruins of Ctesiphon. He also attempted to demolish the palace and reuse its bricks for his own palace, but he desisted only when the undertaking proved too vast.&lt;ref&gt;Bier, L. (1993). The Sassanian Palaces and their Influence in Early Islam. In Ars Orientalis, 23, 62-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed to be the basis for the city of [[Isbanir]] in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

===Modern era===
The ruins of Ctesiphon were the site of [[Battle of Ctesiphon (1915)|a major battle of World War I]] in November 1915. The [[Ottoman Empire]] defeated troops of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] attempting to capture Baghdad, and drove them back some {{convert|40|mi|km}} before [[siege of Kut|trapping the British force and compelling it to surrender]].

== Population and religion ==
Under Sasanian rule, the population of Ctesiphon was heavily mixed: it included [[Arameans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. Several religions were also practiced in the metropolis, which included [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]. In 497, the first Nestorian patriarch [[Mar Babai I]], fixed his see at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, supervising their mission east, with the [[Merv]] metropolis as pivot. The population also included [[Manicheans]], a Dualist church, who continued to be mentioned in Ctesiphon during [[Umayyad]] rule fixing their 'patriarchate of Babylon' there.{{sfn|Morony|2009}} Much of the population fled from Ctesiphon after [[Siege of Ctesiphon (637)|the Arab capture of the metropolis]]. However, a portion of Persians remained there, and some important figures of these people are known to have provided [[Ali]] with presents, which he, however, refused to take. After the [[Battle of Siffin]], the Persian population of Ctesiphon disappeared.{{sfn|Morony|2009}} In the ninth century, the surviving Manicheans fled and displaced their patriarchate up the Silk road, in [[Samarkand]].&lt;ref&gt;John van Schaik, ''Ketters. Een geschiedenis van de Kerk'', Leuven, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
A [[Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft|German Oriental Society]] led by Oscar Reuther excavated at Ctesiphon in 1928–29 mainly at Qasr bint al-Qadi on the western part of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K. |last=Schippmann |chapter=Ktesiphon-Expedition im Winter 1928/29 |title=Grundzüge der parthischen Geschichte |location=Darmstadt |publisher= |year=1980 |isbn=3-534-07064-X |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. |last=Meyer |title=Seleukia und Ktesiphon |journal=Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft zu Berlin |volume=67 |pages=1–26 |year=1929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=O. |last=Reuther |authorlink=Oscar Reuther |title=The German Excavations at Ctesiphon |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=434–451 |year=1929 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00003781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Upton |title=The Expedition to Ctesiphon 1931–1932 |journal=Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art |volume=27 |issue= |pages=188–197 |year=1932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In winter of 1931–1932 a joint expedition of the German State Museums (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin) and The Metropolitan Museum of Art continued excavations at the site, focusing on the areas of Ma'aridh, Tell Dheheb, the Taq-i Kisra, Selman Pak and Umm ez-Za'tir under the direction of Ernst Kühnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ctes/hd_ctes.htm Fowlkes-Childs, Blair. “Ctesiphon.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, an Italian team from the [[University of Turin]] directed by [[Antonio Invernizzi]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Giorgio Gullini|it}} worked at the site, which they identified not as Ctesiphon but as Veh Ardashir. Work mainly concentrated on restoration at the palace of [[Khosrau II]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Gullini and A. Invernizzi, First Preliminary Report of Excavations at Seleucia and Ctesiphon.

'''El Gorah''' is a locale in northeastern [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], in [[Egypt]], approximately 16 kilometers from the [[Israel]]i border and 37&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[El Arish]].  The area is sparsely populated by nomads and by farmers who tend small orchards.

El Gorah is the location of former [[Israeli Air Force]] Base Eitam (named after the biblical station [[Etham]]), built during the Israeli occupation of the northern Sinai from 1967 to 1979. It is currently the location of the headquarters of the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] (MFO) international peacekeeping force, called MFO North Camp.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Contingent Multinational Force and Observers Handbook, 10 Tactical Air Group, July 1987 (unclassified) pg A-1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Europe of 100 Flags''' is a concept developed by Breton nationalist [[Yann Fouéré]] in his 1968 book, ''L'Europe aux Cent Drapeaux''.&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;Kelly, Mike (ndg) [https://www.southampton.ac.uk/publicpolicy/what-we-do/blogs/viewsoneurope/voe16-kelly.page "What the French really think about Brexit"] [[University of Southampton]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Noel (ndg) [http://fondationyannfouere.org/english/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/future-based-on-a-100-flags-welsh-nation-1969.gif "Future based on a hundred flags" (review of ''L'Europe aux cent drapeaux'' by Yann Fouéré)] ''Welsh Nation''&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes a redrawing of European borders in a way that more resembles a map of the region during the [[Middle Ages]], including the creation of states for Basques, Bretons, and Kosovars.&lt;ref name="kelly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rydgren2018"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Rydgren|editor-first=Jens|last=Bar-On|first=Tamir|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Radical Right|chapter=The Radical Right and Nationalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XD9FDwAAQBAJ|date=March 2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-027455-9|pages=26-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regions would be designed to promote regionalism and European federalism as a replacement for nationalism, and redefine extreme European boundaries more strictly in terms of ethnically homogeneous "authentic" historic regions. These individually ethnically "pure" states would then be incorporated under a "post-liberal-pan-European framework".&lt;ref name="BackesMoreau2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Backes|first1=Uwe|last2=Moreau|first2=Patrick|title=The Extreme Right in Europe: Current Trends and Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMkEZnJQHksC|date=7 December 2011|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|isbn=978-3-647-36922-8|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rydgren2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlembach2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlembach|first=Raphael|title=Against Old Europe: Critical Theory and Alter-Globalization Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMfeCwAAQBAJ|date=1 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-18388-4|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rydgren2018"/&gt;

It has been embraced by many in the [[far-right]], such as those among the [[Identitarian movement]] and the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' &amp;ndash; the French New Right &amp;ndash; and has been described as a "multiculturalism of the right", one based on exclusion,&lt;ref&gt;Spektorowski, Alberto (26 April 2012) [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17449626.2011.635688?journalCode=rjge20 "The French New Right: multiculturalism of the right and the recognition/exclusionism syndrome"] ''Journal of Global Ethics'' v.8 n.1&lt;/ref&gt; [[monoculturalism|homogeneity]],&lt;ref&gt;Bar-On, Tamir (9-10 February 2015) [http://www.bpb.de/system/files/dokument_pdf/Bar-On-DeBenoist-Fascismwithhumanface-2015.pdf "Alain de Benoist: Neo-fascism with a human face?"] Paper presented at the conference "Entgrenzter Rechtsextremismus?

The '''French Southern and Antarctic Lands'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-5000500.htm |title=List of countries, territories and currencies |accessdate=2008-06-29 |work=Interinstitutional style guide |publisher=Publications Office |date=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|Terres australes et antarctiques françaises}}, '''TAAF''') is an [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] ({{lang-fr|Territoire d'outre-mer}} or {{lang|fr|TOM}}) of [[France]]. It consists of:

# [[Kerguelen Islands]] ({{lang|fr|Archipel des Kerguelen}}), a group of [[volcano|volcanic]] [[island]]s in the southern [[Indian Ocean]], southeast of [[Africa]], approximately equidistant between Africa, [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]];
# [[Île Saint-Paul|St. Paul]] and [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] islands ({{lang|fr|Îles Saint Paul et Amsterdam}}), a group to the north of Kerguelen;
# [[Crozet Islands]] ({{lang|fr|Îles Crozet}}), a group in the southern Indian Ocean, south of Madagascar;
# [[Adélie Land]] ({{lang|fr|Terre Adélie}}), the French claim on the continent of [[Antarctica]];
# the [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean|Scattered Islands]] ({{lang|fr|Îles Éparses}}), a dispersed group of islands around the coast of [[Madagascar]].

The territory is sometimes referred to as the '''French Southern Lands''' ({{lang-fr|Terres australes françaises}}) or '''French Southern Territories''', usually to emphasize non-recognition of French [[sovereignty]] over [[Adélie Land]] as part of the [[Antarctic Treaty]] system. 

The territory has no permanent civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;"The TAAF do not have any permanent population." {{cite web |url=http://www.taaf.fr/The-French-Southern-and-Antarctic-Lands |title=The French Southern and Antarctic Lands |publisher=French Southern and Antarctic Lands administration |accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those resident consist of visiting military personnel, officials, scientific researchers and support staff.

== Administration ==
The French Southern and Antarctic Lands have formed a {{lang|fr|[[overseas territory (France)|territoire d'outre-mer]]}} (an overseas territory) of [[France]] since 1955. Formerly, they were administered from [[Paris]] by an {{lang|fr|administrateur supérieur}} assisted by a secretary-general; since December 2004, however, their administrator has been a ''[[prefect (France)|préfet]]'', currently Cécile Pozzo di Borgo, with headquarters in [[Saint-Pierre, Réunion|Saint-Pierre]] on [[Réunion|Réunion Island]].

The territory is divided into five districts:

--&gt;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; According to new law 2007-224 of February 21, 2007, the Scattered Islands constitute the TAAF's fifth district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taaf.fr/rubriques/iles/iles_introduction.htm |title=Les îles Éparses |accessdate=2007-03-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502044529/http://www.taaf.fr/rubriques/iles/iles_introduction.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The TAAF website does not mention their population. The data are not included in the totals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; The ''Îles Éparses'' principal station is on [[Tromelin Island]]. The headquarters of the district chief lies beyond the TAAF, in [[Saint-Pierre, Réunion|Saint-Pierre]] on [[Réunion|Réunion Island]].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; The Territory's principal station is [[Martin-de-Viviès]] on [[Île Amsterdam]]. The capital and headquarters of the Territorial administrator lies beyond the TAAF, in Saint-Pierre on Réunion Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Each district is headed by a district chief, who has powers similar to those of a French mayor (including recording births and deaths and being an [[police in France|officer of judicial police]]).

Because there is no permanent population, there is no elected assembly, nor does the territory send representatives to the national parliament.

== Geography ==
[[File:TAAF-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|300px|Map of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands.&lt;br/&gt;{{smaller|[[Adélie Land]] (in Antarctica) and Banc du Geyser and Bassas da India (in the [[Îles Éparses]] district) are not shown.}}]]
[[File:Pringlea antiscorbutica Mayes fake.jpg|thumb|left|Kerguelen cabbages on Mayes Island, [[Kerguelen Islands|Kerguelen]].]]

The territory includes [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam Island]], [[Île Saint-Paul|Saint-Paul Island]], [[Crozet Islands]], and the [[Kerguelen Islands]] in the southern Indian Ocean near 43°S, 67°E, along with [[Adélie Land]], the [[Antarctic territorial claims|sector of Antarctica claimed by France]], named by the French explorer [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] after his wife.

Adélie Land (about {{convert|432000|km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the islands, totaling {{convert|7781|km2|abbr=on}}, have no indigenous inhabitants, though in 1997 there were about 100 researchers whose numbers varied from winter (July) to summer (January).

Amsterdam Island and Saint-Paul Island are extinct [[volcano]]es and have been delineated as the [[Amsterdam and Saint-Paul Islands temperate grasslands]] [[ecoregion]]. The highest point in the territory is Mont Ross on Kerguelen Island at {{convert|1850|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There are very few airstrips on the islands, only existing on islands with weather stations, and the {{convert|1232|km|abbr=on}} of coastline have no ports or harbors, only offshore anchorages.
[[File:Kerguelen VolcanDuDiable.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kerguelen Islands]] – The Volcan du Diable.]]

The islands in the Indian Ocean are supplied by the special ship ''[[Marion Dufresne (1995)|Marion Dufresne]]'' sailing out of [[Le Port, Réunion|Le Port]] in [[Réunion Island]]. Terre Adélie is supplied by ''[[L'Astrolabe (1986 icebreaker)|Astrolabe]]'' sailing out of [[Hobart]] in [[Tasmania]].

However, the territory has a [[merchant marine]] fleet totaling (in 1999) 2,892,911 [[Gross Register Tonnage|GRT]]/{{DWT|5,165,713|metric|disp=long}}, including seven bulk carriers, five cargo ships, ten chemical tankers, nine container ships, six liquefied gas carriers, 24 petroleum tankers, one refrigerated cargo ship, and ten roll-on-roll-off ([[RORO]]) carriers. This fleet is maintained as a subset of the French register that allows French-owned ships to operate under more liberal taxation and manning regulations than permissible under the main French register. This register, however, is to vanish,{{when|date=December 2014}} replaced by the International French Register (''Registre International Français'', RIF).

== Economy ==
The territory's natural resources are limited to fish and crustaceans. Economic activity is limited to servicing [[Meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Geophysics|geophysical]] research stations and French and other fishing fleets.

The main fish resources are [[Patagonian toothfish]] and [[spiny lobster]]. Both are poached by foreign fleets; because of this, the [[French Navy]] and occasionally other services patrol the zone and arrest poaching vessels. Such arrests can result in heavy fines and/or the seizure of the ship.

France used to sell licenses to foreign fisheries to fish the Patagonian toothfish; because of overfishing, it is now restricted to a small number of fisheries from Réunion Island.

The territory takes in revenues of about [[euro|€]]16 million a year.

== Codes ==

The French Southern Territories (i.e. the TAAF excluding Adélie Land) have been given the following [[country code]]s: FS ([[List of FIPS country codes|FIPS]]) and [[ISO 3166-2:TF|TF]] ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]).

The '''geo URI scheme''' is a [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI) scheme defined by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]]'s RFC 5870 (published 8 June 2010)&lt;ref name="RFC5870"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5870|title=RFC 5870 - A Uniform Resource Identifier for Geographic Locations (geo URI)|date=2010-06-08|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for geographic locations using the 'geo' [[URI scheme|scheme name]].  A 'geo' URI identifies a physical location in a two- or three-dimensional [[Spatial referencing system|coordinate reference system]] in a compact, simple, human-readable, and [[Communications protocol|protocol]]-independent way.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The current revision of the [[vCard]] specification&lt;ref name="RFC6350"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350|title=RFC 6350 - vCard Format Specification|date=2011-08-11|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force|accessdate=19 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; supports geo URIs in a vCard's "GEO" property, and the [[GeoSMS]] standard uses geo URIs for [[geotagging]] SMS messages. [[Android (operating system)|Android]] based devices support geo URIs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/g-app-intents.html|title=Android Intents List|publisher=google.com|date=|accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; although that implementation is based on a draft revision of the specification, and supports a different set of URI parameters and query strings.

A geo URI is not to be confused with the site GeoUrl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geourl.org/ |title=Geourl.org |publisher=Geourl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227152230/http://geourl.org/ |archivedate=2011-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which implements [[ICBM address]]).

==Example ==

A simple geo URI might look like:

:&lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677&lt;/code&gt;

where the two numerical values represent [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] respectively,&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; and are separated by a [[comma]].&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; They are coordinates of an [[Horizontal position representation|horizontal grid]] (2D). If a third comma-separated value is present, it represents [[altitude]];&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; so, coordinates of a 3D  grid.  Coordinates in the Southern and Western hemispheres as well as altitudes below the coordinate reference system (depths) are signed negative with a leading dash.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; 

The geo URI also allows for an optional "uncertainty" value, separated by a [[semicolon]], representing the uncertainty of the location in meters, and is described using the "u" URI parameter.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; A geo URI with an uncertainty parameter looks as follows:

:&lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677;u=35&lt;/code&gt;

A geo URI may, for example, be included on a web page, as [[HTML]]:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="geo:37.786971,-122.399677;u=35"&gt;Wikimedia Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

so that a geo URI-aware [[user agent]] such as a [[web browser]] could launch the user's chosen mapping service; or it could be used in an [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] feed or other [[XML]] file.

== Coordinate reference systems ==

The values of the coordinates only make sense when a [[coordinate reference system]] (CRS) is specified. The default CRS is the [[World Geodetic System|World Geodetic System 1984]] (WGS-84),&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; and it is not recommended to use any other:

{{quote| The optional 'crs' URI parameter described below may be used by future specifications to define the use of CRSes other than WGS-84. This is primarily intended to cope with the case of another CRS  replacing WGS-84 as the predominantly used one, rather than allowing the arbitrary use of thousands of CRSes for the URI (which would clearly affect interoperability).&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt;
}}

The only justified use of other CRS today is, perhaps, to preserve projection in [[Scale_(map)#Large-scale_maps_with_curvature_neglected|large-scale maps]], as local [[Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system|UTM]], or for non-terrestrial coordinates such as those on [[Moon|the Moon]] or [[Mars]].  The syntax and semantic of the CRS parameter, separated by a semicolon, is described at section 8.3 of RFC&amp;nbsp;5870. Examples:

* The [[Washington Monument]]'s location  expressed with [[Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system#UTM_zone|UTM-zone 18S]] and its [http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-18s/ standard ID]:
*: &lt;code&gt;geo:323482,4306480;crs=EPSG:32718;u=20&lt;/code&gt;
* A geo URI for a hypothetical lunar CRS created in 2011 might be:
*: &lt;code&gt;geo:37.786971,-122.399677;crs=Moon-2011;u=35&lt;/code&gt;

The order in which the semicolon-separated parameters occur is partially significant.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; Whilst the labeltext parameter and future parameters may be given in any order, the &lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; parameters must come first. If both are used, the &lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; must precede the &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; All parameters are [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]],&lt;ref name="RFC5870" /&gt; so, imagining a future new parameter &lt;code&gt;mapcolors&lt;/code&gt;, it can be ignored by simpler applications, and the above example is exactly equivalent to:
: &lt;code&gt;geo:323482,4306480;CRS=epsg:32718;U=20;mapcolors=for_daltonic&lt;/code&gt;
Being in doubt, remember that use of the lowercase representation of parameter names (&lt;code&gt;crs&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mapcolors&lt;/code&gt;) is preferred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29661">In [[geodesy]], '''conversion''' among different '''geographic coordinate''' systems is made necessary by the different [[geographic coordinate system]]s in use across the world and over time. Coordinate conversion is composed of a number of different types of conversion: format change of geographic coordinates, conversion of coordinate systems, or transformation to different [[geodetic datum]]s. Geographic coordinate conversion has applications in [[cartography]], [[surveying]], [[navigation]] and [[geographic information systems]].

In geodesy, geographic coordinate ''conversion'' is defined as translation among different coordinate formats or [[map projection]]s all referenced to the same geodetic datum.&lt;ref name=Foster2009&gt;{{cite web|author1=Roger Foster  |author2=Dan Mullaney|title=Basic Geodesy Article 018: Conversions and Transformations|publisher=National Geospatial Intelligence Agency|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/geoarticles/pdfs/Article018_Conversions_and_Transformations.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A geographic coordinate ''transformation'' is a translation among different geodetic datums. Both geographic coordinate conversion and transformation will be considered in this article.

This article assumes readers are already familiar with the content in the articles [[geographic coordinate system]] and [[geodetic datum]].

==Coordinate format conversion==

Informally, specifying a geographic location usually means giving the location's [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. The numerical values for latitude and longitude can occur in a number of different formats:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coordinate transformer|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/gps/transformation|publisher=Ordnance Survey Great Britain|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[degree (angle)|degrees]] [[Minute of arc|minutes]] [[Arcsecond|seconds]] : 40° 26′ 46″ N 79° 58′ 56″ W
* degrees decimal minutes: 40° 26.767′ N 79° 58.933′ W
* decimal degrees: 40.446° N 79.982° W

There are 60 minutes in a degree and 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, to convert from a degrees minutes seconds format to a decimal degrees format, one may use the formula

: &lt;math&gt; \rm{decimal\  degrees} = \rm{degrees} + \rm{minutes}/60 + \rm{seconds}/3600&lt;/math&gt;.

To convert back from decimal degree format to degrees minutes seconds format,

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  \rm{degrees} &amp; = \lfloor\rm{decimal\  degrees}\rfloor \\
  \rm{minutes} &amp; = \lfloor 60 \times (\rm{decimal\  degrees} - \rm{degrees})\rfloor  \\
  \rm{seconds} &amp; = 3600 \times (\rm{decimal\  degrees} - \rm{degrees}) - 60 \times \rm{minutes} \\
  \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where the notation &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; means take the integer part of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and is called a [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]].

==Coordinate system conversion==

A coordinate system conversion is a conversion from one coordinate system to another, with both coordinate systems based on the same geodetic datum. Common conversion tasks include conversion between geodetic and [[ECEF]] coordinates and conversion from one type of map projection to another.

=== From geodetic to [[ECEF]] coordinates ===

[[Image:Geodetic latitude and the length of Normal.svg|thumb|The length PQ is called ''prime vertical radius'' (&lt;math&gt;\, N(\phi) &lt;/math&gt;). The length IQ is equal to &lt;math&gt;\, e^2 N(\phi) &lt;/math&gt;. R = &lt;math&gt;\, (X,Y,Z) &lt;/math&gt;.]]

Geodetic coordinates (latitude &lt;math&gt;\ \phi&lt;/math&gt;, longitude &lt;math&gt;\ \lambda&lt;/math&gt;, height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;) can be converted into [[ECEF]] coordinates using the following equation:&lt;ref name="gps-chap10"&gt;{{cite book|title=GPS - theory and practice|author1=B. Hofmann-Wellenhof |author2=H. Lichtenegger |author3=J. Collins |isbn=3-211-82839-7|page=282|others=Section 10.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;  \begin{align}
      X &amp; = \left( N(\phi)  + h\right)\cos{\phi}\cos{\lambda} \\
      Y &amp; = \left( N(\phi)  + h\right)\cos{\phi}\sin{\lambda} \\
      Z &amp; = \left( \frac{b^2}{a^2} N(\phi) + h\right)\sin{\phi}
    \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt;
  N(\phi) = \frac{a^2}{\sqrt{a^2 \cos^2 \phi + b^2 \sin^2 \phi }}
  = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1-e^2\sin^2\phi}},
&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are the equatorial radius ([[semi-major axis]]) and the polar radius ([[semi-minor axis]]), respectively. &lt;math&gt;e^2 = 1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the square of the first numerical eccentricity of the ellipsoid. The ''prime vertical radius of curvature'' &lt;math&gt;\, N(\phi) &lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the surface to the Z-axis along the ellipsoid normal (see "[[Earth radius#Radius of curvature|Radius of curvature on the Earth]]"). The parameter &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is eliminated by subtracting
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}}{\cos\phi}= N+h&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{Z}{\sin\phi}= \frac{b^2}{a^2}N+h,&lt;/math&gt;
so the following equation holds:
: &lt;math&gt;
  \frac{p}{\cos \phi} - \frac{Z}{\sin \phi} - e^2 N(\phi) = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; p=\sqrt{X^2+Y^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Orthogonal coordinates|orthogonality]] of the coordinates is confirmed via differentiation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}
dX \\
dY \\
dZ \\
\end{pmatrix}  &amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix}
-\sin \lambda &amp; -\sin \phi \cos \lambda &amp; \cos \phi  \cos \lambda \\
\cos \lambda &amp; -\sin \phi \sin \lambda &amp; \cos \phi \sin \lambda \\
0 &amp; \cos \phi &amp; \sin \phi \\
\end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix}
dE \\
dN \\
dU \\
\end{pmatrix} ,
\\
\begin{pmatrix}
dE \\
dN \\
dU \\
\end{pmatrix} &amp;=
\begin{pmatrix}
\left(N(\phi)+h\right) \cos \phi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; M(\phi)+h &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
d\lambda \\
d\phi \\
dh \\
\end{pmatrix} ,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--
: &lt;math&gt;  \begin{align}
      &amp; \big(dX,\,dY,\,dZ\big) \\[6pt]
= &amp; \big(-\sin \phi \cos \lambda ,\,-\sin \phi \sin \lambda ,\,\cos \phi \big) \left(M(\phi)+h\right) \, d\phi \\[6pt]
&amp;{}+ \big(-\sin \lambda ,\,\cos \lambda ,\,0 \big) \left( N(\phi) +h\right) \cos \phi \, d\lambda \\[6pt]
&amp;{}+ \big(\cos \lambda  \cos \phi ,\,\cos \phi \sin \lambda ,\,\sin \phi \big) \, dh ,
    \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
 M(\phi)  = \frac{a(1- e^2)}{\left(1-e^2 \sin^2 \phi\right)^{3/2}}
&lt;/math&gt;
(see also "[[Meridian arc#Meridian distance on the ellipsoid|Meridian arc on the ellipsoid]]").
&lt;!--
The infinitesimal length caused by latitude and longitude is calculated as follows (see also "[[Meridian_arc#Meridian_distance_on_the_ellipsoid|Meridian arc on the ellipsoid]]"):
: &lt;math&gt;
 ds^2 = \left(\frac{a(1- e^2)}{\left(1-e^2 \sin^2 \phi\right)^{3/2}}+h\right)^2d\phi^2 + \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1-e^2 \sin^2 \phi }} +h\right)^2 \cos^2 \phi \, d\lambda^2 .
&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;

=== From ECEF to geodetic coordinates ===

The conversion of ECEF coordinates to geodetic coordinates (such WGS84) involves more trigonometry but is sensitive to small accuracy due to Rn and h being maybe 10^6 apart,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferris.edu/faculty/burtchr/papers/cartesian_to_geodetic.pdf R. Burtch, A Comparison of Methods Used in Rectangular to Geodetic Coordinate Transformations.]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Featherstone |first=W. E. |last2=Claessens |first2=S. J. |title=Closed-Form Transformation between Geodetic and Ellipsoidal Coordinates |journal=Stud. Geophys. Geod. |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |year=2008 |doi=10.1007/s11200-008-0002-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but longitude is same as geocentric, &lt;math&gt;\,\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- : &lt;math&gt;\lambda =  \arctan \frac{y}{x} &lt;/math&gt;. --&gt;

There are several methods that solve the equation; two are shown.

Geod. |volume=73 |issue=11 |pages=603–610 |year=1999 |doi=10.1007/s001900050271 }} (Appendix B)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J. J. |last1=Sudano|doi=10.1109/NAECON.1997.622711|title=An exact conversion from an earth-centered coordinate system to latitude, longitude and altitude|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\kappa - 1 - \frac{e^2 a \kappa}{\sqrt{p^2+(1-e^2) Z^2 \kappa^2 }} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \frac{p}{Z} \tan \phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.&lt;/math&gt; The height is calculated as:

: &lt;math&gt;h= e^{-2} (\kappa^{-1} - {\kappa_0}^{-1}) \sqrt{p^2+ Z^2 \kappa^2 }, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\kappa_0= \left( 1-e^2 \right)^{-1} .&lt;/math&gt;

The iteration can be transformed into the following calculation:
: &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{i+1} = \frac{c_i+\left(1- e^2\right) Z^2 \kappa_i ^3 }{c_i- p^2} = 1 + \frac{p^2+\left(1- e^2\right) Z^2 \kappa_i ^3 }{c_i- p^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; c_i = \frac{\left(p^2+\left(1-e^2\right) Z^2 \kappa_i ^2\right)^{3/2}}{a e^2} .&lt;/math&gt;

The constant &lt;math&gt;\, \kappa_0&lt;/math&gt; is a good starter value for the iteration when &lt;math&gt;h \approx 0&lt;/math&gt;. Bowring showed that the single iteration produces a sufficiently accurate solution. He used extra trigonometric functions in his original formulation.
&lt;!--
: &lt;math&gt; \kappa \approx \kappa_1 = \left(c+\frac{ z^2}{1-e^2 }\right)/\left(c-(1-e^2)\left(x^2+y^2\right)\right), &lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt; c=\frac{\left(\left(1-e^2\right) (x^2+y^2)+z^2\right)^{3/2}}{a e^2 \sqrt{1-e^2}} . &lt;/math&gt;  --&gt;
&lt;!-- For &lt;math&gt;h=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\kappa=\frac{1}{1-e^2}&lt;/math&gt;, which is a good starter for the iteration. Bowring showed that the single iteration produces the sufficiently accurate solution under the condition of &lt;math&gt;h \approx 0&lt;/math&gt;. --&gt;

===== The application of Ferrari's solution =====
A number of techniques and algorithms are available but the most accurate according to Zhu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J.|last1= Zhu|title=Conversion of Earth-centered Earth-fixed coordinates to geodetic coordinates|journal = IEEE Trans. Aerospace and Electronic Systems|volume=30|year=1994|pages=957–961|doi=10.1109/7.303772}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the following 15 step procedure summarised by Kaplan. It is assumed that geodetic parameters &lt;math&gt;\{a, b, e, e'\}&lt;/math&gt; are known

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
r &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{X^2+Y^2}\\
e'^2 &amp;=&amp; (a^2 - b^2) / b^2\\
E^2 &amp;=&amp;  a^2 - b^2\\
F &amp;=&amp; 54b^2Z^2\\
G &amp;=&amp; r^2 + (1-e^2)Z^2 - e^2E^2\\
C &amp;=&amp; \frac{e^4Fr^2}{G^3}\\
S &amp;=&amp; \sqrt[3]{1+C+\sqrt{C^2 + 2C}}\\
P &amp;=&amp; \frac{F}{3\left(S+\frac{1}{S}+1\right)^2G^2}\\
Q &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{1+2e^4P}\\

\phi &amp; = &amp; \arctan\left[ \frac{Z+e'^2Z_0}{r}\right] \\
\lambda &amp;=&amp; \arctan2[Y,X]
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Note:''' [[atan2|arctan2]][Y,X] is the four-quadrant inverse tangent function.

==== Power Series ====
For small {{math|e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} the power series
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \sum_{i\ge 0} \alpha_i e^{2i}&lt;/math&gt;
starts with
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_0 = 1;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_1=\frac{a}{\sqrt{Z^2+p^2}};&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_2=\frac{aZ^2\sqrt{Z^2+p^2}+2a^2p^2}{2(Z^2+p^2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Geodetic to/from [[Axes conventions#Ground reference frames: ENU and NED|ENU]] coordinates ===
To convert from geodetic coordinates to local [[Axes conventions#Ground reference frames: ENU and NED|ENU]] coordinates is a two-stage process:

#Convert geodetic coordinates to ECEF coordinates
#Convert ECEF coordinates to local ENU coordinates

==== From ECEF to ENU ====

To transform from ECEF coordinates to the local coordinates we need a local reference point, typically this might be the location of a radar.  If a radar is located at &lt;math&gt;\{X_r, Y_r, Z_r\}&lt;/math&gt; and an aircraft at &lt;math&gt;\{X_p, Y_p, Z_p\}&lt;/math&gt; then the vector pointing from the radar to the aircraft in the ENU frame is

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z\\
\end{bmatrix}
=  \begin{bmatrix}
-\sin\lambda_r &amp; \cos\lambda_r &amp; 0 \\
-\sin\phi_r\cos\lambda_r &amp; -\sin\phi_r\sin\lambda_r &amp; \cos\phi_r \\
\cos\phi_r\cos\lambda_r &amp; \cos\phi_r\sin\lambda_r&amp; \sin\phi_r
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_p - X_r \\
Y_p-Y_r \\
Z_p - Z_r
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Note:''' &lt;math&gt;\ \phi&lt;/math&gt; is the ''geodetic'' latitude.  A prior version of this page showed use of the ''geocentric'' latitude (&lt;math&gt;\ \phi^\prime&lt;/math&gt;).  The ''geocentric'' latitude is ''not'' the appropriate ''up'' direction for the local tangent plane.  If the original ''geodetic'' latitude is available it should be used, otherwise, the relationship between ''geodetic'' and ''geocentric'' latitude has an altitude dependency, and is captured by:

: &lt;math&gt;\tan\phi^\prime  = \frac{Z_r}{\sqrt{X_r^2 + Y_r^2}} = \frac{ N(\phi) (1 - f)^2 + h}{ N(\phi) + h}\tan\phi&lt;/math&gt;

Obtaining ''geodetic'' latitude from ''geocentric'' coordinates from this relationship requires an iterative solution approach, otherwise the ''geodetic'' coordinates may be computed via the approach in the section above labeled "From ECEF to geodetic coordinates."

&lt;!-- In that document, the greek letters phi and lambda should be switched: Reference http://psas.pdx.edu/CoordinateSystem/Latitude_to_LocalTangent.pdf for another example of computing ENU coordinates.
--&gt;
The geocentric and geodetic longitude have the same value. This is true for the Earth and other similar shaped planets because their latitude lines (parallels) can be considered in much more degree perfect circles when compared to their longitude lines (meridians).

: &lt;math&gt;\tan\lambda = \frac{Y_r}{X_r}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Note:''' Unambiguous determination of &lt;math&gt;\ \phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ \lambda&lt;/math&gt; requires knowledge of which [[Cartesian coordinate system#Two-dimensional coordinate system quadrant|quadrant]] the coordinates lie in.

==== From ENU to ECEF ====

This is just the inversion of the ECEF to ENU transformation so

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
X\\
Y\\
Z\\
\end{bmatrix}
=  \begin{bmatrix}
 -\sin\lambda &amp;  -\sin\phi\cos\lambda &amp;\cos\phi\cos\lambda \\
\cos\lambda &amp;  -\sin\phi\sin\lambda &amp; \cos\phi\sin\lambda \\
0 &amp;  \cos\phi&amp; \sin\phi
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z
\end{bmatrix}
+ \begin{bmatrix}
X_r \\
Y_r \\
Z_r
\end{bmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;

=== Conversion across map projections ===

Conversion of coordinates and map positions among different map projections reference to the same datum may be accomplished either through direct translation formulas from one projection to another, or by first converting from a projection &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to an intermediate coordinate system, such as ECEF, then converting from ECEF to projection &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. The formulas involved can be complex and in some cases, such as in the ECEF to geodetic conversion above, the conversion has no closed-form solution and approximate methods must be used. References such as the ''DMA Technical Manual 8358.1''&lt;ref name=TM8358.2&gt;{{cite web|title=TM8358.2: The Universal Grids: Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) and Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS)|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tm8358.2/TM8358_2.pdf|publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the USGS paper ''Map Projections: A Working Manual''&lt;ref name=Snyder1987&gt;{{cite book|last=Snyder|first=John P.|title=Map Projections: A Working Manual|year=1987|publisher=USGS Professional Paper: 1395|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395}}&lt;/ref&gt; contain formulas for conversion of map projections. It is  common to use computer programs to perform coordinate conversion tasks, such as with the DoD and NGA supported GEOTRANS program.&lt;ref name=GEOTRANS_NGA&gt;{{cite web|title=MSP GEOTRANS 3.3 (Geographic Translator)|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/geotrans/|publisher=NGA: Coordinate Systems Analysis Branch|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Datum transformations ==

[[File:Possible paths for datum transform.svg|400px|right|alt=coordinate transform paths|The different possible paths for transforming geographic coordinates from datum &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to datum &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;]]
Transformations among datums can be accomplished in a number of ways. There are transformations that directly convert geodetic coordinates from one datum to another. There are more indirect transforms that convert from geodetic coordinates to ECEF coordinates, transform the ECEF coordinates from one datum to the another, then transform ECEF coordinates of the new datum back to geodetic coordinates. There are also grid-based transformations that directly transform from one (datum, map projection) pair to another (datum, map projection) pair.

=== Grid-based method ===

[[File:Datum Shift Between NAD27 and NAD83.png|thumb|Magnitude of shift in position between NAD27 and NAD83 datum as a function of location.]]

Grid-based transformations directly convert map coordinates from one (map-projection, geodetic datum) pair to map coordinates of another (map-projection, geodetic datum) pair. An example is the NADCON method for transforming from the North American Datum (NAD) 1927 to the NAD 1983 datum.&lt;ref name=ESRI_grid&gt;{{cite web|title=ArcGIS Help 10.1: Grid-based methods|url=http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#//003r00000013000000|publisher=ESRI|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Accuracy Reference Network (HARN), a high accuracy version of the NADCON transforms, have an accuracy of approximately 5 centimeters. The National Transformation version 2 ([[NTv2]]) is a Canadian version of NADCON for transforming between NAD 1927 and NAD 1983. HARNs are also known as NAD 83/91 and High Precision Grid Networks (HPGN).&lt;ref name=nadcon_harn&gt;{{cite web|title=NADCON/HARN Datum ShiftMethod|url=http://www.bluemarblegeo.com/knowledgebase/geocalc/classdef/datumshift/datumshifts/nadcon.html|publisher=bluemarblegeo.com|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Australia and New Zealand adopted the NTv2 format to create grid-based methods for transforming among their own local datums.

Like the multiple regression equation transform, grid-based methods use a low-order interpolation method for converting map coordinates, but in two dimensions instead of three. The [[NOAA]] provides a software tool (as part of the NGS Geodetic Toolkit) for performing NADCON transformations.&lt;ref name=NOAA_NADCON&gt;{{cite web|title=NADCON - Version 4.2|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/NADCON/|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mulcare&gt;{{cite web|last=Mulcare |first=Donald M. |title=NGS Toolkit, Part 8: The National Geodetic Survey NADCON Tool |url=http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=1193 |publisher=Professional Surveyor Magazine |accessdate=5 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306001134/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=1193 |archivedate=6 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molodensky transformation ===

The Molodensky transformation converts directly between geodetic coordinate systems of different datums without the intermediate step of converting to geocentric coordinates (ECEF).&lt;ref name=esri_eq_based&gt;{{cite web|title=ArcGIS Help 10.1: Equation-based methods|url=http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.1/index.html#//003r00000012000000|publisher=ESRI|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It requires the three shifts between the datum centers and the differences between the reference ellipsoid semi-major axes and flattening parameters.

The Molodensky transform is used by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) in their standard TR8350.2 and the NGA supported GEOTRANS program.&lt;ref name=NGA_Datum&gt;{{cite web|title=Datum Transformations|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/datums/index.html|publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Molodensky method was popular before the advent of modern computers and the method is part of many geodetic programs.

=== Multiple regression equations ===

Datum transformations through the use of empirical [[multiple regression]] methods were created to achieve higher accuracy results over small geographic regions than the standard Molodensky transformations. MRE transforms are used to transform local datums over continent-sized or smaller regions to global datums, such as WGS 84.&lt;ref name=IHO&gt;{{cite report|title=User's Handbook on Datum Transformations Involving WGS 84 |date=August 2008 |edition=3rd |series=Special Publication No. 60 |publisher=International Hydrographic Bureau |location=Monaco |url=https://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S60_Ed3Eng.pdf |accessdate=2017-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard NIMA TM 8350.2, Appendix D,&lt;ref name=tr8350_2&gt;{{cite web|title=DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE WORLD GEODETIC SYSTEM 1984 Its Definition and Relationships with Local Geodetic Systems|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/wgs84fin.pdf|publisher=National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA)|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists MRE transforms from several local datums to WGS 84, with accuracies of about 2 meters.&lt;ref name=taylor_high&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=High-Accuracy Datum Transformations|url=http://home.hiwaay.net/~taylorc/bookshelf/math-science/geodesy/datum/transform/high-accuracy/|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MREs are a direct transformation of geodetic coordinates with no intermediate ECEF step. Geodetic coordinates &lt;math&gt;\phi_B, \lambda_B, h_B&lt;/math&gt; in the new datum &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are modeled as [[polynomial]]s of up to the ninth degree in the geodetic coordinates &lt;math&gt;\phi_A, \lambda_A, h_A&lt;/math&gt; of the original datum &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, the change in &lt;math&gt;\phi_B&lt;/math&gt; could be parameterized as (with only up to quadratic terms shown){{r|IHO|page1=9}}

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi = a_0 + a_1 U + a_2 V + a_3 U^2 + a_4 UV + a_5 V^2 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       a_i  &amp; = \rm{parameters\  fitted\  by\  multiple\  regression} \\
       U    &amp; = K(\phi_A - \phi_m) \\

       V    &amp; = K(\lambda_A - \lambda_m) \\
       K    &amp; = \rm{scale\  factor} \\
       \phi_m,\lambda_m &amp; = \rm{origin\  of\  the\  datum\ }A \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with similar equations for &lt;math&gt; \Delta\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta h&lt;/math&gt;. Given a sufficient number of &lt;math&gt;(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; coordinate pairs for landmarks in both datums for good statistics, multiple regression methods are used to fit the parameters of these polynomials. The polynomials, along with the fitted coefficients, form the multiple regression equations.

=== Helmert transformation ===

{{main|Helmert transformation}}

Use of the Helmert transform in the transformation from geodetic coordinates of datum &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to geodetic coordinates of datum &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; occurs in the context of a three-step process:&lt;ref name=HelmertNZ&gt;{{cite web|title=Equations Used for Datum Transformations|url=http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/conversion-coordinates/geodetic-datum-conversion/datum-transformation-equations/index.aspx|publisher=Land Information New Zealand (LINZ)|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Convert from geodetic coordinates to ECEF coordinates for datum &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
# Apply the Helmert transform, with the appropriate &lt;math&gt;A\to B&lt;/math&gt; transform parameters, to transform from datum &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ECEF coordinates to datum &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ECEF coordinates
# Convert from ECEF coordinates to geodetic coordinates for datum &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of ECEF XYZ vectors, the Helmert transform has the form&lt;ref name=HelmertNZ/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} X_B \\ Y_B \\ Z_B \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} c_x \\ c_y \\ c_z \end{bmatrix} + (1 + s\times10^{-6}) \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;-r_z&amp;r_y \\ r_z&amp;1&amp;-r_x \\ -r_y &amp; r_x &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} X_A \\ Y_A \\ Z_A \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

The Helmert transform is a seven-parameter transform with three translation (shift) parameters &lt;math&gt;c_x, c_y, c_z&lt;/math&gt;, three rotation parameters &lt;math&gt;r_x, r_y, r_z&lt;/math&gt; and one scaling (dilation) parameter &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. The Helmert transform is an approximate method that is accurate when the transform parameters are small relative to the magnitudes of the ECEF vectors. Under these conditions, the transform is considered reversible.&lt;ref name=OGP7_2&gt;{{cite web|title=Geomatics  Guidance Note Number 7, part 2    Coordinate Conversions and Transformations including Formulas|url=http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf|publisher=International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP)|accessdate=5 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306005736/http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourteen-parameter Helmert transform, with linear time dependence for each parameter,{{r|OGP7_2|page1=131-133}} can be used to capture the time evolution of geographic coordinates dues to [[geomorphic]] processes, such as continental drift.&lt;ref name=Bolstad&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolstad|first=Paul|title=GIS Fundamentals, 4th Edition|publisher=Atlas books|isbn=978-0-9717647-3-6|page=93|url=http://www.paulbolstad.net/4thedition/samplechaps/GISFundChap3.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202201558/http://www.paulbolstad.net/4thedition/samplechaps/GISFundChap3.pdf|archivedate=2016-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earthquakes.&lt;ref name=addend_8350_2&gt;{{cite web|title=Addendum to NIMA TR 8350.2:  Implementation of the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84)  Reference Frame G1150|url=http://gis-lab.info/docs/nima-tr8350.2-addendum.pdf|publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been incorporated into software, such as the Horizontal Time Dependent Positioning (HTDP) tool from the U.S. NGS.&lt;ref name=HTDP&gt;{{cite web|title=HTDP - Horizontal Time-Dependent Positioning|url=https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Htdp/Htdp.shtml|publisher=U.S. National Geodetic Survey (NGS)|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molodensky-Badekas transformation ===

To eliminate the coupling between the rotations and translations of the Helmert transform, three additional parameters can be introduced to give a new XYZ center of rotation closer to coordinates being transformed. This ten-parameter model is called the ''Molodensky-Badekas transformation'' and should not be confused with the more basic Molodensky transform.{{r|OGP7_2|page1=133-134}}

Like the Helmert transform, using the Molodensky-Badekas transform is a three-step process:
# Convert from geodetic coordinates to ECEF coordinates for datum &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
# Apply the Molodensky-Badekas transform, with the appropriate &lt;math&gt;A\to B&lt;/math&gt; transform parameters, to transform from datum &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ECEF coordinates to datum &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ECEF coordinates
# Convert from ECEF coordinates to geodetic coordinates for datum &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;

The transform has the form&lt;ref name=MB_NGA&gt;{{cite web|title=Molodensky-Badekas (7+3) Transformations|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/datums/molodensky.html|publisher=National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA)|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(X^0_A,Y^0_A,Z^0_A)&lt;/math&gt; is the origin for the rotation and scaling transforms and &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt; is the scaling factor.

The Molodensky-Badekas transform is used to transform local geodetic datums to a global geodetic datum, such as WGS 84. Unlike the Helmert transform, the Molodensky-Badekas transform is not reversible due to the rotational origin being associated with the original datum.{{r|OGP7_2|page1=134}}

'''Great-circle navigation''' or '''orthodromic navigation''' (related to '''orthodromic course'''; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ορθóς'', right angle, and ''δρóμος'', path) is the practice of [[navigation|navigating]] a vessel (a [[ship]] or [[aircraft]]) along a [[great circle]]. Such routes yield the shortest [[distance]]  between two points on the globe.&lt;ref name="WeintritNeumann2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adam Weintrit|author2=Tomasz Neumann|title=Methods and Algorithms in Navigation: Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=buMsPGyE7boC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=loxodromic+navigation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GIZeu8DBp5&amp;sig=1UcvzLLnZjKTSpaS9ECPnMmpidU&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBWoVChMIq9ztmPzSyAIViXEUCh03eAKe#v=onepage&amp;q=loxodromic%20navigation&amp;f=false|date=7 June 2011|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-0-415-69114-7|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great circle path may be found using [[spherical trigonometry]]; this is the spherical version of the ''inverse geodesic problem''.

deal with differences between other points, e.g., &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the quadrants of &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are determined by the signs of the numerator and denominator in the tangent formulas (e.g., using the [[atan2]] function).
The [[central angle]] between the two points, &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\tan\sigma_{12}=\frac{\sqrt{(\cos\phi_1\sin\phi_2-\sin\phi_1\cos\phi_2\cos\lambda_{12})^2 + (\cos\phi_2\sin\lambda_{12})^2}}{\sin\phi_1\sin\phi_2+\cos\phi_1\cos\phi_2\cos\lambda_{12}}.&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|group=note|A simpler formula is

that all the trigonometric terms appear as products; this minimizes the number of table lookups
required.  Furthermore, the redundancy in these formulas serves as a check in hand calculations.  If using
these equations to determine the shorter path on the great circle, it is necessary to ensure
that {{!}}&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;&amp;pi; (otherwise the longer path is found).}}
(The numerator of this formula contains the quantities that were used to determine
tan&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.)
The distance along the great circle will then be ''s''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''R''&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''R'' is the assumed radius
of the earth and &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in [[Radian#Conversions|radians]].
Using the [[Earth radius#Mean radius|mean earth radius]], ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;asymp;&amp;nbsp;{{convert|6371|km|mi|abbr=on}}  yields results for
the distance ''s''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; which are within 1% of the
[[Geodesics on an ellipsoid|geodesic distance]] for the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid.

==Finding way-points==

To find the [[way-point]]s, that is the positions of selected points on the great circle between
''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we first extrapolate the great circle back to its ''node'' ''A'', the point
at which the great circle crosses the
equator in the northward direction: let the longitude of this point be &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; — see Fig&amp;nbsp;1.  The azimuth at this point, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha_0 = \frac
{\sin\alpha_1 \cos\phi_1}{\sqrt{\cos^2\alpha_1 + \sin^2\alpha_1\sin^2\phi_1}}.&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|group=note|A simpler formula is
:&lt;math&gt;
\sin\alpha_0 = \sin\alpha_1 \cos\phi_1;
&lt;/math&gt;
however, this is less accurate
&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;asymp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;frac12;&amp;pi;.
}}
Let the angular distances along the great circle from ''A''  to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. Then using [[Spherical trigonometry#Napier's rules for quadrantal triangles|Napier's rules]] we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\tan\sigma_{01} = \frac{\tan\phi_1}{\cos\alpha_1}
\qquad&lt;/math&gt;(If &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;frac12;&amp;pi;, use &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).

This gives &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;, whence &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.

The longitude at the node is found from
&lt;!-- Don't simplify sin(sigma)/cos(sigma) to tan(sigma).  This gives the wrong quadrant for lambda. --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tan\lambda_{01} &amp;= \frac{\sin\alpha_0\sin\sigma_{01}}{\cos\sigma_{01}},\\
\lambda_0 &amp;= \lambda_1 - \lambda_{01}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Sphere geodesic 2sigma.svg|thumb|200px|right|Figure 2. The great circle path between a node (an equator crossing) and an arbitrary point (&amp;phi;,&amp;lambda;).]]
Finally, calculate the position and azimuth at an arbitrary point, ''P'' (see Fig. 2), by  the spherical version of the ''direct geodesic problem''.{{refn|group=note|The direct geodesic problem, finding the position of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; given ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,
and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, can also be solved by
[[Solution of triangles#Two sides and the included angle given|formulas for solving a spherical triangle]], as follows,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_{12} &amp;= s_{12}/R,\\
\sin\phi_2 &amp;= \sin\phi_1\cos\sigma_{12} + \cos\phi_1\sin\sigma_{12}\cos\alpha_1,\quad\text{or}\\
\tan\phi_2 &amp;= \frac{\sin\phi_1\cos\sigma_{12} + \cos\phi_1\sin\sigma_{12}\cos\alpha_1}
{\sqrt{ (\cos\phi_1\cos\sigma_{12} - \sin\phi_1\sin\sigma_{12}\cos\alpha_1)^2 + (\sin\sigma_{12}\sin\alpha_1)^2 }},\\
\tan\lambda_{12} &amp;= \frac{\sin\sigma_{12}\sin\alpha_1}
{\cos\phi_1\cos\sigma_{12} - \sin\phi_1\sin\sigma_{12}\cos\alpha_1},\\
\lambda_2 &amp;= \lambda_1 + \lambda_{12},\\
\tan\alpha_2 &amp;= \frac{\sin\alpha_1}
{\cos\sigma_{12}\cos\alpha_1 - \tan\phi_1\sin\sigma_{12}}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The solution for way-points given in the main text is more general than this solution in that
it allows
way-points at specified longitudes to be found.  In addition, the solution for &amp;sigma;
(i.e., the position of the node)
is needed when finding [[geodesics on an ellipsoid]] by means of the auxiliary sphere.}} Napier's rules give
:&lt;math&gt;
{\color{white}.\,\qquad)}\tan\phi = \frac
{\cos\alpha_0\sin\sigma}{\sqrt{\cos^2\sigma + \sin^2\alpha_0\sin^2\sigma}},&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|group=note|A simpler formula is
:&lt;math&gt;
\sin\phi = \cos\alpha_0\sin\sigma;&lt;/math&gt;
however, this is less accurate when
&amp;phi;&amp;nbsp;&amp;asymp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;frac12;&amp;pi;}}
:&lt;!-- Don't simplify sin(sigma)/cos(sigma) to tan(sigma).  This gives the wrong quadrant for lambda. --&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tan(\lambda - \lambda_0) &amp;= \frac
{\sin\alpha_0\sin\sigma}{\cos\sigma},\\
\tan\alpha &amp;= \frac
{\tan\alpha_0}{\cos\sigma}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The [[atan2]] function should be used to determine
&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;,
&amp;lambda;, and &amp;alpha;.
For example, to find the
midpoint of the path, substitute &amp;sigma;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;frac12;(&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;); alternatively
to find the point a distance ''d'' from the starting point, take &amp;sigma;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''d''/''R''.
Likewise, the ''vertex'', the point on the great
circle with greatest latitude, is found by substituting &amp;sigma;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+&amp;frac12;&amp;pi;.
It may be convenient to parameterize the route in terms of the longitude using
:&lt;math&gt;\tan\phi = \cot\alpha_0\sin(\lambda-\lambda_0).&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|group=note|
The following is used: &lt;math&gt;\cos\sigma = \cos\phi \cos(\lambda-\lambda_0)&lt;/math&gt;}}
Latitudes at regular intervals of longitude can be found and the resulting positions transferred to the Mercator chart
allowing the great circle to be approximated by a series of [[rhumb line]]s.  The path determined in this way
gives the [[great ellipse]] joining the end points, provided the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\phi,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;
are interpreted as geographic coordinates on the ellipsoid.

These formulas apply to a spherical model of the earth.  They are also used in solving for the great circle
on the ''auxiliary sphere'' which is a device for finding the shortest path, or ''geodesic'', on
an ellipsoid of revolution; see
the article on [[geodesics on an ellipsoid]].

==Example==
Compute the great circle route from [[Valparaíso]],
&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;33&amp;deg;,
&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;71.6&amp;deg;, to
[[Shanghai]],
&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;31.4&amp;deg;,
&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;121.8&amp;deg;.

The formulas for course and distance give
&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;166.6&amp;deg;,&lt;ref group=note&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;
is reduced to the range [&amp;minus;180&amp;deg;,&amp;nbsp;180&amp;deg;] by adding or subtracting 360&amp;deg; as
necessary&lt;/ref&gt;
&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;94.41&amp;deg;,
&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;78.42&amp;deg;, and
&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;168.56&amp;deg;.  Taking the [[Earth radius#Mean radius|earth radius]] to be
''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6371&amp;nbsp;km, the distance is
''s''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;18743&amp;nbsp;km.

To compute points along the route, first find
&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;56.74&amp;deg;,
&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;96.76&amp;deg;,
&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;71.8&amp;deg;,
&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;98.07&amp;deg;, and
&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;169.67&amp;deg;.
Then to compute the midpoint of the route (for example), take
&amp;sigma;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;frac12;(&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;12.48&amp;deg;, and solve
for
&amp;phi;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;6.81&amp;deg;,
&amp;lambda;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;159.18&amp;deg;, and
&amp;alpha;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;57.36&amp;deg;.

&amp;alpha;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;57.45&amp;deg;.

==Gnomonic chart==
A straight line drawn on a [[gnomonic projection|gnomonic chart]] would be a great circle track. When this is transferred to a [[Mercator projection|Mercator chart]], it becomes a curve. The positions are transferred at a convenient interval of [[longitude]] and this is plotted on the Mercator chart.

'''Hacı Ahmet''' was a purported [[Muslim]] [[cartographer]] linked to a 16th-century [[map]] of the world. Ahmet appended a commentary to the map, outlining his own life and an explanation for the creation of the map. But it is not clear whether Ahmet created the map, or whether he simply translated it into [[Turkish language|Turkish]] for use in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman world]].

==The map==

Hacı Ahmet appended a lengthy commentary to a 16th-century map of the world annotated in the [[Turkish language]], known as ''The Ottoman [[Mappa mundi|Mappa Mundi]] of Hacı Ahmet'', amongst other titles, which opens with "Whoever wishes to know the true shape of the world, their minds shall be filled with light and their breast with joy."&lt;ref name=Casale1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casale|first1=Giancarlo|title=Two Examples of Ottoman Discovery Literature from the mid-Sixteenth Century|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The map is heart shaped, otherwise known as a "cordiform projection," a style that was popular in sixteenth century Europe, and the extant copy was printed from wooden blocks in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], in 1559. It was kept until the late 18th century in the archives of the Venetian [[Council of Ten]]. The map is now part of the Heritage Library in the [[Qatar National Library]].

Known as the "Mappamondo Hacı Ahmet", the map outlines legends and place-names in Turkish, and it may be the first map in Turkish ever published for sale to an Ottoman audience.&lt;ref name=Arbel1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Menage1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ménage | first1 = V. L. | title = 'The Map of Hajji Ahmed' and its Makers | journal = Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 291–314| year = 1958| doi = 10.1017/S0041977X00072682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the map is original, or was simply a translation into Turkish, it helps show how the people of the [[Ottoman Empire]] perceived themselves in relation to the wider world.&lt;ref name=Menage1/&gt; Three small spheres appear below the main map at the bottom of the page - the central graphic represents Earth and a number of satellite planets, while the left and right depict constellations.

Within the accompanying text of the map, Hacı Ahmet explains that the map was created to share knowledge of the shape of the world, especially of the [[New World]]. Specifically, Ahmet points out that the [[Ancient philosophy|classical philosophers]], such as [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]], did not know about the newly discovered continent, which he says shows that the world is round.&lt;ref name=Casale1/&gt; He says that the New World demonstrates the "extent to which the Ottomans were participants in their own right in the process of physical expansion abroad and intellectual ferment at home that characterized the period of history commonly referred to as the [[Age of Exploration]]". Ahmet also assigns the Ottoman Empire's rulers and kingdoms to the celestial bodies represented in the lower quadrant of the map, a maneuver which has been interpreted as an effort to impose a hierarchical geopolitical system that preferences Ottoman rule above all other world powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Writing History at the Ottoman Court : Editing the Past, Fashioning the Future|last=Casale |first=Giancarlo |editor1-last=Cipa |editor1-first=H.

== Authorship ==

[[File:Oronce Fine.png|thumb|right|French cartographer Oronce Fine (1494-1555)]]
[[File:Map-heart-054.jpg|thumb|right|Heart-Shaped World Map by Oronce Fine (1534)]]

The map is considered unlikely to be original, and was probably translated into Turkish by Ahmet.&lt;ref name=Arbel1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Arbel | first1 = B. | title = Maps of the world for ottoman princes? Further evidence and questions concerning the mappamondo of Hajji Ahmed' | journal = Imago Mundi | volume = 54 | pages = 19–99 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1080/03085690208592956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The map has specific European characteristics, in that it includes the use of Western terms,&lt;ref name=Casale1/&gt; suggesting Ahmet translated an older map into Turkish. In fact, throughout the map’s accompanying text, Ahmet emphasizes translation, stating that he “translated it from the language and alphabet of the Europeans into that of the Muslims”.&lt;ref name=Casale1/&gt; A further argument made against Ahmet's authorship is that the “heart-shaped form of the map had already been used by earlier European cartographers”.&lt;ref name=Arbel1/&gt;

The map is "heart-shaped" and is constructed by a cordioform projection developed by 16th century [[cartographer]]s and [[mathematician]]s including [[Johannes Werner]] (1468-1522), a German [[mathematician]] and [[geographer]].

The map has been tentatively linked to several other [[geographer]]s, including [[Giovanni Battista Ramusio]] (1485-1557).&lt;ref name=Menage1/&gt; It has also been argued that it shares similarities with a map by the French cartographer [[Orontius Finnaeus|Orontius]] (1494-1555), published in 1534.&lt;ref name=Menage1/&gt;

== The Venetian connection ==

Ahmet claimed the map was made for Ottoman princes, and some of the sons of [[Suleyman the Magnificent]] were interested in maps of the world and had looked to Venice for their production.&lt;ref name=Menage1/&gt; This resulted in the development of Ottoman-Venetian relations, which offered "new interpretations of Venetian attitudes to the production of world maps for Ottoman clients".&lt;ref name=Arbel1/&gt;

The map's printing in Venice helps to highlight aspects of Ottoman-Venetian relations. In the minds of Venetian publishers, it would be “a promising venture to produce a world-map for sale in the Muslim world”,&lt;ref name=Menage1/&gt; and so the production of world maps was financially rewarding for European publishers. Maps in the Turkish language were in demand by the Ottoman Empire, and maps were translated into Turkish to satisfy that market.&lt;ref name=Menage1/&gt;

==The life of Hacı Ahmet==

Nothing is known of Hacı Ahmet himself, other than his own account of his life recorded in the map text.&lt;ref name=Fabri1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fabri|first1=A|title=The Ottoman Mapp Mundi of Hacı Ahmet of Tunis|journal=Arab Historical Review for Ottoman Studies|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“I, this poor, wretched and downtrodden Hacı Ahmet of [[Tunis]] studied since I was a small child in the [[Morocco|Maghrib]], in the city of [[Fes|Fez]]", says Ahmet in the text, which briefly describes his origins, saying that he was captured from the infidels and described how, in creating the map, he would regain his liberty.

According to the story, Ahmet was educated in Fez, and when a European nobleman purchased him, he was able to continue to practice his [[Islam]]ic religion.&lt;ref name=Casale1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arbel1/&gt;

'''Labadee''' ({{lang-fr|Labadie}}) is a port located on the northern coast of [[Haiti]] within the arrondissement of [[Cap-Haïtien Arrondissement|Cap-Haïtien]] in the [[Nord (Haitian department)|Nord]] department. It is a private resort leased to [[Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.]], for the exclusive use of passengers of its three cruise lines: [[Royal Caribbean International]], [[Celebrity Cruises]], and [[Azamara Club Cruises]], until 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13093234 |title=Haiti:The island and the outside world|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=12 February 2009 |website=www.economist.com |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Caribbean has contributed the largest proportion of tourist revenue to Haiti since 1986, employing 300 locals, allowing another 200 to sell their wares on the premises for a fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0125/p01s02-woam.html|title=Could this paradise really be poor, desperate Haiti?|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and paying the Haitian government $12 USD per tourist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcnn.ht/en/2014_08/tourism/353/Haiti's-local-community-to-benefit-from-additional-fee-from-cruise-passengers-Haiti-Laurent-Lamothe-Royal-Caribbean.htm|title=Haiti's local community to benefit from additional fee from cruise passengers|publisher=Haitian Caribbean News Network|accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The resort is completely tourist-oriented, and is guarded by a private security force. The site is fenced off from the surrounding area, and passengers are not allowed to leave the property. Food available to tourists is brought from the cruise ships. A controlled group of Haitian merchants are given sole rights to sell their merchandise and establish their businesses in the resort. Although sometimes described as an [[island]] in advertisements, it is actually a [[peninsula]] contiguous with the island of [[Hispaniola]]. The [[cruise ship]] moors to the pier at Labadee capable of servicing the [[Oasis class cruise ship|Oasis class ships]], which was completed in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expedia.com/daily/cruise/geo/ports.asp?tiid=6024010| title=Labadee |publisher=www.expedia.com |accessdate=2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Attractions include a Haitian [[flea market]], [[beach]]es, [[watersport]]s, a water-oriented playground, an [[alpine coaster]], and the largest [[zip-line]] over water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The location is named after the '''Marquis de La Badie''', a Frenchman who first settled the area in the 17th century. The peninsula and a village were named Labadie.&lt;ref name="cruise-travel" /&gt; The cruise company spells the name "Labadee" to make it easier for [[English language|English]]-speakers to pronounce.&lt;ref name="cruise-travel"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gjADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=labadee&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html Cruise Travel - Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Cruise ship Labadee Haïti.jpg|thumb|left|The [[MS Freedom of the Seas|''Freedom of the Seas'']] moored in Labadee]]

In 1991, a journalist revealed that passengers who disembarked at the location were not informed they were in Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9TctWjHHOeEC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=labadee&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html AIDS and Accusation: Haiti and the Geography of Blame, Updated with a New ... - Paul Farmer - Google Boeken&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yBUk0w-kXs0C&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=labadee&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html Last Resorts: The Cost of Tourism in the Caribbean - Polly Pattullo - Google Boeken&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, a crew member from the cruise line Royal Caribbean was attacked on Labadee in an apparent robbery. The assailants were arrested by [[Haitian National Police|Haitian police]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cruisecritic.com/news/news.cfm?ID=403 RCI Crew Member Attacked in Labadee&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Labadee Haiti.jpg|thumb|right|Labadee beach, close to [[Cap-Haïtien]]]] 
In February 2004, Royal Caribbean temporarily suspended use of the stop due to political unrest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2004/02/29/TRGFF576751.TMP | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=CRUISES / Sittin' on the dock of the Gulf | date=2004-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Royal Caribbean has since returned to using this private port.

In 2009, Royal Caribbean made US$55 million improvements to the facilities, including upgrading port facilities to allow docking of their largest cruise ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/17/cruise-ships-haiti-earthquake |title=Cruise ships still find a Haitian berth |accessdate= |author=Robert Booth |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2010-01-17 |year= |month= |work= The Guardian |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, just after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Royal Caribbean decided to continue its luxury cruises to the private port. The corporation announced it would be donating US$1 million to fund relief efforts in Haiti, and to use cruise ships to ferry relief supplies and personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Booth, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/17/cruise-ships-haiti-earthquake “Cruise ships still find a Haitian berth”] (20.1.2010) The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, local Haitians in boats peacefully but noisily blocked the port, in protests against the current Haitian government and upcoming elections. Royal Caribbean's ''[[MS Freedom of the Seas|Freedom of the Seas]]'' cancelled their port stop on January 19 as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/cruiselog/2016/01/20/royal-caribbean-ship-drops-haiti-amid-protests/79056806/ |title= Cruise ship turns away from Haiti amid protests|last=Golden |first=Fran |date=January 20, 2016  |website= |publisher=[[USA Today]] |access-date=March 6, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landscape maintenance''' (or '''groundskeeping''') is the art and vocation of keeping a landscape healthy, clean, safe and attractive, typically in a [[residential garden|garden]], [[yard (land)|yard]], [[park]], institutional setting or [[Estate (house)|estate]].  Using [[tool|tools]], supplies, knowledge, physical exertion and skills, a [[groundskeeper]] may plan or carry out annual plantings and harvestings, periodic weeding and fertilizing, other [[gardening]], [[lawn]] care, [[snow removal]], [[driveway]] and path maintenance, [[shrubbery|shrub]] pruning, [[topiary]], lighting, [[fence|fencing]], [[swimming pool]] care, runoff drainage, and [[irrigation]], and other jobs for protecting and improving the [[topsoil]], [[plants]], and garden accessories.

Groundskeepers may also deal with local [[animal]]s (including [[bird]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[domesticated|domestic]] animals or [[pet]]s), and create means to attract or repel them, as desired or necessary.  A garden may also be designed to include exotic animals, such as a [[koi]] pond.  In larger estates, groundskeepers may be responsible for providing and maintaining habitat for wild animals.

== Landscape maintenance industry ==
Some private research firms estimate that landscape maintenance is a $77 billion industry in [[North America]], with nearly 1 million employees working for over 400,000 businesses as of February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=1497 |title=Landscaping Services in the US: Market Research Report |publisher=ibisworld.com |date=2016-02-01 |accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimated in May 2015 that statistical group 37-3011 "Landscaping and Groundskeeping Workers" numbered 895,600 with a median annual wage of $25,030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes373011.htm |title=Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2015 |publisher=bls.gov |date=2015-05-01 |accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BLS says of this group:  "Workers typically perform a variety of tasks, which may include any combination of the following: sod laying, mowing, trimming, planting, watering, fertilizing, digging, raking, sprinkler installation, and installation of mortarless segmental concrete masonry wall units".

This is a '''list of the bird species recorded in Réunion'''. The avifauna of [[Réunion]] include a total of 91 species, of which four are [[Endemism in birds|endemic]], 21 have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] by humans and 20 are rare or accidental. One species listed is [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in Réunion and is not included in the species count. Six species are globally threatened.

This list's [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of ''[[The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World]]'', 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Réunion.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. Not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species.

* (A) '''[[Vagrancy (biology)|Accidental]]''' - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Réunion
* (E) '''[[Endemic]]''' - a species endemic to Réunion
* (I) '''[[Introduced species|Introduced]]''' - a species introduced to Réunion as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions
* (Ex) '''[[Local extinction|Extirpated]]''' - a species that no longer occurs in Réunion although populations exist elsewhere
* (X) '''[[Extinct]]''' - a species formerly found on Réunion, but no longer exists alive globally

This is a '''list of countries and territories by border/area ratio'''. For each [[country]] or [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]], the total length of the land borders and the total surface area are listed, as well as the [[ratio]] between these two parameters. A high border/area ratio means that the country or territory has a long border compared to its surface area. A border/area ratio of zero indicates that the country has no land borders.

Countries or territories that are connected only by [[bridge]]s or other man-made [[causeway]]s are not considered to have land borders.

==Border/area ratio==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3731">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Nauru'''. There are 4 mammal species in [[Nauru]], all of which are marine mammals of the order Cetacea.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the 4 species have been assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]], as there is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to these species, so all are marked  DD (Data Deficient).

==Subclass: [[Theria]]==

===Infraclass: [[Eutheria]]===

====Order: [[Cetacea]] (whales)====
----

The order Cetacea includes [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s. They are the mammals most fully [[aquatic adaptation|adapted to aquatic]] life with a spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by a thick layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.

*Suborder: [[Odontoceti]]
**Superfamily: [[Platanistoidea]]
***Family: [[Ziphidae]]
****Subfamily: [[Hyperoodontinae]]
*****Genus: [[Mesoplodon]]
****** [[Blainville's Beaked Whale]] ''Mesoplodon densirostris'' DD
****** [[Ginkgo-toothed Beaked Whale]] ''Mesoplodon ginkgodens'' DD
***Family: [[Delphinidae]] (marine dolphins)
****Genus: [[Lagenodelphis]]
***** [[Fraser's Dolphin]] ''Lagenodelphis hosei'' DD
****Genus: [[Feresa]]
***** [[Pygmy Killer Whale]] ''Feresa attenuata'' DD

[[File:Liugongjun.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Water gate in 1934]]
'''Liugongzun''' ({{zh|c=瑠公圳|p=Liúgōngjùn|w=Liu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-kung&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-tsun&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is the name of a system of [[canal]]s and [[irrigation]] ditches that once crisscrossed the city of [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. Most of the canals were covered over by roads and streets in the 1970s due to increasing volumes of traffic and diminishing necessity of water transportation and irrigation.

The canals ranged from wide, navigable waterways used for transportation to narrow ditches used primarily for irrigation and drainage. They ranged from the [[Keelung River]] in the north to the [[Wenshan District]] in the south of the city.

The waters of much of the Liugongjun canal system still flow beneath the city streets, and there remain a few spots where the canal is exposed and visible, most notably at the northern end of [[Xinsheng Road|Xinsheng North Road]]. There have been recent proposals to [[Daylighting (streams)|daylight]] sections of the canal.

The '''M180''' is a {{convert|25.5|mi|}} motorway in England from junction 5 on the [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18 motorway]] in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster]] to a point close to [[Humberside Airport]] some {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} from the port of [[Immingham]] and {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} from the port of [[Grimsby]] and the east coast and provides access for major routes to [[Cleethorpes]], [[Grimsby]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] (via the [[Humber Bridge]]), [[Immingham]], [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[Scunthorpe]],  [[Humberside Airport]] and the Killingholme Oil Refineries; [[Humber Oil Refinery]] and [[Lindsey Oil Refinery]]. The road forms part of the unsigned [[International E-road network|Euroroute]] [[European route E22|E22]] and is the main route along the south bank of the [[Humber Estuary]]. At 25 miles long it is the longest motorway in the United Kingdom to carry a three digit number.

==History==
[[File:Motorway 180 - plan.png|right|thumb|Plan of the M180 and A180]]

===Planning and construction===
The motorway bypass around Brigg was discussed for many years, but the [[Flixborough disaster|Flixborough explosion]] gave it more importance, and was built three years later in 1977 as the second section of the motorway. At this time the A15 ran through Hibaldstow and Redbourne to Brigg, and the junction with the motorway was at Castlethorpe Corner, about {{convert|1|mi|km}} east of the current A15 junction on the line of the Roman [[Ermine Street]]. The initial, and somewhat diminutive section of the motorway was the short-lived A18(M)&lt;ref&gt;[http://pathetic.org.uk/former/a18m/ Pathetic Motorways: A18(M)]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the Tudworth Link, which connected the roundabout junction with the M18 to the A18/[[A614 road|A614]]. The easterly A18(M) sliproad is still used, though the original roundabout at junction 1 has now been replaced by a bridge close to Tudworth Hall Farm. The last section to be built was the [[River Trent|Trent]] viaduct, opened in October 1979 by [[Kenneth Clarke]], despite being 43 weeks late on account of strikes and bad weather.

The motorway is built to dual three-lane standard for most of its duration (aside from a short dual two-lane section past [[Scunthorpe]]), and is quite straight and flat.

The M180 has its own spur – the [[M181 motorway|M181]].  While the M180 has to make do with a [[roundabout]] junction with the [[M18_motorway_(Great_Britain)|M18]], its spur has a large, freeflowing trumpet [[road junction|interchange]]. At the start of the M180 are the [[Doncaster North services]], owned by [[Moto Hospitality|Moto]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20050421114053/http://www.moto-way.com/page.cfm?Section=2&amp;location=32 Doncaster North]

=== A180 extension ===
It was extended in the 1980s to trunk-road standard as the [[A180 road (England)|A180]] which is a two lane dual carriageway which continues on to [[Grimsby]] and [[Cleethorpes]]. In its early planning stages, it was to be named the [[A18 road (Great Britain)|A18]].

The £18&amp;nbsp;million {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} section from Brigg to [[Ulceby, North Lincolnshire|Ulceby]] (A160) was opened on 29 March 1983 by [[Lynda Chalker, Baroness Chalker of Wallasey]], and the £21&amp;nbsp;million {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} section from Ulceby to Grimsby opened in late 1983.

'''MIKE BASIN''' is an extension of [[ArcMap]] ([[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]]) for integrated water resources management and planning. It provides a framework for managers and stakeholders to address multi-sectoral allocation and environmental issues in river basins. It is designed to investigate water sharing issues at international or interstate level, and between competing groups of water users, including the environment. MIKE BASIN is developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]]. As of September 2014, MIKE BASIN is no longer available for order or download from DHI. It has been replaced by the application named '''MIKE HYDRO Basin'''.

==Applications==
MIKE BASIN can be used for providing solutions and alternatives to water allocation and [[water shortage]] problems, improving and optimizing reservoir and hydropower operations, exploring conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water, evaluating and improving irrigation performance, solving multi-criteria optimization problems, establishing cost-effective measures for water quality compliance.

The '''M.E.M. (Master of Environmental Management)''' is a degree designed for students with primary interests in careers in [[environmental policy]] and [[analysis]], [[stewardship]], [[education]], [[Consultant|consulting]], or [[management]] dealing with [[natural resource]] or [[Environmental quality|environmental]] issues. The program requires course work in both the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, with a particular focus on the relationship among [[science]], management, and [[policy]]. The ultimate purpose of the [[degree program]] is to prepare students to address ecological and social systems with scientific understanding and an ability to make sense of the complex underlying social and ecological context.

The value of an interdisciplinary environmental degree is best espoused by [[Aldo Leopold]], who obtained a [[Master of Forestry]] degree.

''"One of the requisites for an ecological comprehension of land is an understanding of ecology, and this is by no means co-extensive with 'education'; in fact, much higher education seems deliberately to avoid ecological concepts. An understanding of ecology does not necessarily originate in courses bearing ecological labels; it is quite as likely to be labeled geography, botany, agronomy, history, or economics. This is as it should be...".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leopold|first=Aldo|title=A Sand County Almanac: And Sketches Here and There|year=1949|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mazovia''' ({{lang-pl|Mazowieckie}}) is a historical region in mid-north-eastern [[Poland]]. It spans across the [[North European Plain]], roughly between [[Lodz]] and [[Bialystok]], with [[Warsaw]] being the unofficial capital and largest city. Throughout the centuries, Mazovia developed a separate sub-culture featuring diverse folk songs, architecture, dress and traditions different to those of other [[Poles]].  

Historical Mazovia existed from the [[Middle Ages]] until the [[partitions of Poland]] and consisted of three [[voivodeship]]s with the capitals in [[Warsaw]], [[Płock]] and [[Rawa Mazowiecka|Rawa]]. The main city of the region was [[Płock]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WjLUlyZdlMgC&amp;dq=Mazowsze&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UhVWhXC_aI&amp;sig=mJNzDnqRNzhmQoRUO44qq7TQ0vk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=snEJS-zWKYzk8AbBrtnNDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=13&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  ''Mazowsze: Obraz Etnograficzny''], Volume 1, by Wojciech Gerson and Oskar Kolberg, BiblioBazaar, 2009 - 372 pages&lt;/ref&gt; however, in the [[Early Modern Times]] it lost its importance to Warsaw, which became the capital of Poland. From 1138, Mazovia was governed by a separate branch of the [[Piast dynasty]] and when the last ruler of the independent [[Duchy of Mazovia]] died, it was fully incorporated to the [[Polish Crown]] in 1526. During the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] over 20% of Mazovian population was categorized as petty [[szlachta|nobility]]. Between 1816 and 1844, the Mazovian Governorate was established, which encompassed the south of the region along with [[Łęczyca Land]] and south-eastern [[Kuyavia]]. The former inhabitants of Mazovia are the [[Masurians]], who, as [[Protestants]], took refuge in neighboring [[East Prussia]] in the later so-called region of [[Masuria]]. 

The borders of contemporary [[Mazovian Voivodeship]] (province), which was created in 1999, do not reflect exactly its original size as they don't include the historically Mazovian cities of [[Łomża]] and [[Łowicz]], but include the Lesser Polish [[Radom]] and [[Siedlce]].

==Geography==
[[File:Mazowsze w.png|thumb|right|275px|Historical lands of Mazovia]]

Mazovia has a landscape without hills (in contrast to [[Lesser Poland]]) and without lakes (in contrast to [[Greater Poland]]). It is spread over the [[Mazovian Lowland]], on both sides of the [[Vistula]] river and its confluence with [[Narew]] and [[Bug River|Bug]]. Forests (mainly coniferous) cover one-fifth of the region, with the large [[Kampinos Forest]], [[Puszcza Biała]] and [[Puszcza Zielona]].

In the north Mazovia borders on the [[Masuria]]n subregion of former [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], in the east on [[Podlachia]], in the south on [[Lesser Poland]] and in the west on [[Greater Poland]] (subregions of [[Łęczyca Land]], [[Kujawy]] and [[Dobrzyń Land]]). The area of Mazovia is 33,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It has population of 5&amp;nbsp;million (3&amp;nbsp;million of them inhabit the [[metropolis]] of [[Warsaw]]).

==History==
When the Slavs came to this region from the surrounding area of [[Polesian Lowland|Polesie]], they mingled with the descendants of [[Vistula Veneti]]&lt;ref&gt;Roland Steinacher: ''Vandalen.

Verlag der [[Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften|ÖAW]], Wien 2004, S. 329–353, {{ISBN|3-7001-3296-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and with other people who had settled here such as the [[Wielbark culture|Wielbark]] people.&lt;ref&gt;J. Piontek et al. "Odontological analysis of central european populations from the Roman period and the Early Middle Ages". Humanbiologia Budapestinensis.  30. 2007. pp. 77-86.

[[File:Zamek książąt mazowieckich w Czersku 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Czersk Castle|Castle of the Mazovian Dukes]] in [[Czersk, Masovian Voivodeship|Czersk]], 1410]]

The historical region of Mazovia (''Mazowsze'') in the beginning encompassed only the territories on the right bank of Vistula near [[Płock]] and had strong connections with [[Greater Poland]] (through [[Włocławek]] and [[Kruszwica]]). In the period of the rule of the first monarchs of the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] State, Płock was one of their seats, and on the Cathedral Hill (Wzgórze Tumskie) they raised [[palatium]]. In the period 1037–1047 it was the capital of the independent, Mazovian state of [[Miecław|Masław]]. Between 1079 and 1138 this city was ''de facto'' the [[List of former national capitals|capital of Poland]]. Since 1075 it has been the seat of the [[diocese]] encompassing northern Mazovia; the south formed the archdeaconate of [[Czersk]] belonging to [[Poznań]], and the [[Duchy of Łowicz]] was part of the [[Gniezno]] archdiocese (this division remained as long as until the [[Partitions of Poland]]).

[[File:Nagrobek ksiazat mazowieckich sw. Jan 01.jpg|thumb|right|Tombstone of Janusz III and his brother Stanisław in [[St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw|St. John's Archcathedral]], [[Warsaw]]]]

During the 9th century Mazovia was perhaps inhabited by the tribe of [[Mazovians]], and it was incorporated into the Polish state in the second half of 10th century under the Piast ruler [[Mieszko I]]. In 1138 the duchy of Mazovia was established, and during the 12th and 13th centuries it joined temporarily various adjacent lands and endured invasions of [[Old Prussians|Prussians]], [[Yotvingians]], and [[Ruthenians]]. To protect its northern section [[Conrad I of Mazovia]] called in the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1226 and granted them the [[Chełmno Land]].

After the reunification of the Polish state by [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław I]] in the early 14th century, Mazovia became its fief in 1351. In the second half of 15th century western Mazovia and in 1526/1529 the main part (with its capital in Warsaw) was incorporated into the Polish state. In the 15th century the eastern part of the region ([[Łomża]]) was settled, mainly by the [[yeomanry]] (''drobna [[szlachta]]''). Mazovia was considered underdeveloped in comparison with [[Greater Poland]] and [[Lesser Poland]], with the lowest urban population.

{{Details|Duchy of Mazovia}}

In the [[Early Modern Times]] Mazovia was known for exporting grain, timber, and fur. It was also distinct because there was no [[reformation]] here. Mazovia was divided into three voivodeships, each of them divided into lands ({{lang-pl|ziemie}}, {{lang-la|terrae}}), each of them divided into counties ({{lang-pl|powiaty}}, {{lang-la|districtus}}). The Polish-[[Lithuania]]n [[Union of Lublin]] (1569) established Mazovia as the central region of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with [[Warsaw]] rising to prominence as the seat of the state legislature (''[[sejm]]''). In 1596 King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] moved the Polish capital from [[Kraków]] to [[Warsaw]]. During the 17th and 18th centuries Swedish, Transylvanian, Saxon, and Russian invasions wreaked havoc on the region.

In 1793 western Mazovia, and two years later the rest of the region became part of Prussia (only the south-eastern portion was annexed by Austria). In 1807 it became part of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. In 1815 the region was incorporated into the [[Congress Kingdom of Poland]], which was dependent on Russia. In the 19th century Mazovia was the site of Polish rebellions against Russian rule. In that era pre-partition Mazovia was divided among [[Warsaw]], [[Płock]] and [[Augustów]] (the last one replaced later by [[Łomża]]).

Since 1918 Mazovia has been a part of the resurrected Poland, being roughly equivalent to the [[Warsaw Voivodeship (1975-1998)|Warsaw Voivodeship]]. Under the German occupation of Warsaw during World War II, the city’s population decreased sharply as a result of executions, the extermination of the city’s Jews, the deaths of some 200,000 inhabitants during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] of 1944, and the deportation of the city’s left-bank population following the uprising. Shortly after the uprising, [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered German troops to destroy the city. The rebuilding of the Polish capital was the main task of the postwar period.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/659713/Mazowieckie|title=Mazowieckie &amp;#124; province, Poland &amp;#124; Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those times [[Warsaw Voivodeship (1975-1998)|Warsaw Voivodeship]] was still roughly similar to historical Mazovia and used to be informally called so, but in 1975 it was divided into several little voivodeships. However, in 1999 [[Mazovian Voivodeship]] was created as one of [[Voivodeships of Poland|16 administrative regions of Poland]].

===Local cuisine===
There is no specific regional cuisine of Mazovia. Formerly, dairy foods dominated the peasant cuisine. Nobles used poultry, geese, chickens, ducks. Most separate Mazovian culinary region's is [[Kurpie]] and [[Łowicz]], where traditional dishes survive to the present day. In Kurpie traditional dishes are prepared with ingredients collected in the forest: berries, honey and mushrooms. There are several [[Polish cuisine|traditional Polish dishes]], e.g. [[flaki]], [[kluski]], which are prepared in different way than in other parts of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foody.pl/strony/1/i/1009.php Kuchnia Mazowsza i Kurpiów] – Kuchnia Polska&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuron.com.pl/widelcem_po_mapie/art4.html Potrawy mazowieckie] – Kuron.com.pl&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mazovian Voivodeship]] is ranked decidedly first in Poland according to the [[Gross Domestic Product]].&lt;ref name="forsal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forsal.pl/artykuly/366983,mazowsze_jest_i_bedzie_najbogatsze_w_polsce.html |title=Mazowsze jest i będzie najbogatsze w Polsce - Analizy rynku - Forsal.pl - Giełda, Waluty, Finanse – forex, notowania NBP, surowce |publisher=forsal.pl|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is thanks to Warsaw, which is a financial centre of [[East-Central Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2010/gb2010113_805361.htm Warsaw: Central Europe's Bourse to Beat] - BusinessWeek&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2010/12/13/2003490805 Warsaw makes bid to become Central Europe’s financial hub] – Taipei Times&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of state enterprises are headquartered in this [[metropolis]]. It is a hub for both rail and vehicular traffic, with access throughout Poland and across Europe. [[Warsaw Chopin Airport]] is the nation’s busiest. There are many branches of industry and sercives well developed in this city. The other eonomical center is [[Płock]], where large petrochemical plants [[PKN Orlen]] operate. The rest of Mazovia belongs to the poorest parts of Poland. In the agriculture the most typical Mazovian crops are potatoes and [[rye]], but the most popular (as in whole Poland) is wheat. Others are [[barley]], [[sugar beets]], [[fruits]] (with their biggest Polish ''basin'' in the south of the region), and vegetables. Pigs are commonly bred, often also cows and chickens.

==Tourism==

[[Kampinos National Park]] is one of Poland’s largest national parks and is popular with tourists making day trips from Warsaw to hike among the park’s primeval forests, sand dunes, and marshland. The main cultural centre of the region, and, alongside [[Kraków]], in all of Poland, is Warsaw, which is home to dozens of theatres, the National Philharmonic, the National Opera House, the National Library, the National Museum, [[Centrum Nauki Kopernik]], [[Muzeum Powstania Warszawskiego]], [[Temple of Divine Providence]], and the [[Sanctuary of Blessed Jerzy Popiełuszko]]. Warsaw has many magnificent historic buildings and monuments, including those in the Old Town and the New Town, both of which were almost completely demolished during World War II but were meticulously restored and were designated UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1980. Several important edifices has been built at the adjacent street [[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]. There are also royal palaces and gardens of [[Łazienki]] and [[Wilanów]]. The most interesting building from post-war period is [[Pałac Kultury i Nauki]]. 

Historical monuments elsewhere include the manor house in [[Żelazowa Wola]] where composer [[Frédéric Chopin]] was born and his museum is located nowadays. Płock, once the seat of the Mazovian princes, and [[Łowicz]], the residence of the archbishops of [[Gniezno]], are noted for their [[cathedral]]s. There are also [[palace]]s and parks in [[Nieborów]] and [[Arkadia]], the [[Modlin Fortress]], [[castle]]s in [[Czersk]], [[Pułtusk]], [[Ciechanów]], [[Opinogóra Górna|Opinogóra]], [[Rawa Mazowiecka]], [[Sochaczew]] and [[Liw, Poland|Liw]], as well as churches in [[Niepokalanów]], [[Góra Kalwaria]], [[Warka]], [[Skierniewice]], [[Czerwińsk]], [[Wyszogród]], [[Zakroczym]], [[Szreńsk]], [[Przasnysz]], [[Ostrołęka]], [[Łomża]], [[Szczuczyn]], [[Wizna]], [[Brok, Masovian Voivodeship|Brok]], [[Zuzela]], [[Rostkowo, Płock County|Rostkowo]], and [[Boguszyce, Rawa County|Boguszyce]]. Interesting [[folklore]] is found in the subregion of [[Kurpie]]; another [[skansen]] has been established in [[Sierpc]].&lt;ref name="britannica2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/659713/Mazowieckie |title=Mazowieckie &amp;#124; province, Poland &amp;#124; Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|Русь}}

Originally, the name  '''Rus'''' (Русь) referred to the [[Rus' people|people]],&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513010/Rus "Rus People"]&lt;/ref&gt; regions, and medieval states (9th to 12th centuries) of the [[Kievan Rus']]. In  Western culture, it was better known as [[Ruthenia]] from the 11th century onwards, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CR%5CU%5CRuthenians.htm|title=Ruthenians|website=www.encyclopediaofukraine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its territories are today distributed among [[Belarus]], Northern [[Ukraine]], and the [[European Russia|European section]] of [[Russia]]. The term Россия (Rossija), comes from the [[Byzantine Greek]] designation of the [[Rus' (name)|Rus']], Ρωσσία ''Rossía''—spelled Ρωσία (''Rosía'' &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; [[Help:IPA/Greek|[roˈsia]]]) in [[Modern Greek]].

'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''

One of the earliest written sources mentioning the people called Rus' (as ''Rhos'') dates to 839 in the ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]''. This chronicle identifies them as a [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Germanic tribe called the Swedes]]. According to the [[Kievan Rus']] ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', compiled in about 1113, the Rus' were a group of [[Varangians]], [[Norsemen]] who had relocated somewhere from the [[Baltic region]] (literally "from beyond the sea"), first to Northeastern Europe, then to the south where they created the medieval Kievan state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Viking Rus |last=Duczko|first=Wladyslaw|year=2004|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=978-90-04-13874-2|pages=10–11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEawXSP4AVwC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq|accessdate=December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 11th century, the dominant term in the Latin tradition was ''Ruscia''. It was used, among others, by [[Thietmar of Merseburg]], [[Adam of Bremen]], [[Cosmas of Prague]] and [[Pope Gregory VII]] in his letter to [[Iziaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslav I]]. ''Rucia'', ''Ruzzia'', ''Ruzsia'' were alternative spellings.
During the 12th century, ''Ruscia'' gradually made way for two other Latin terms, "Russia" and "Ruthenia". "Russia" (also spelled ''Rossia'' and ''Russie'') was the dominant [[Romance languages|Romance-language]] form, first used by [[Liutprand of Cremona]] in the 960s and then by [[Peter Damian]] in the 1030s. It became ubiquitous in English and French documents in the 12th century. ''Ruthenia'', first documented in the early 12th century [[Augsburg]] [[annals]], was a Latin form preferred by the [[Apostolic Chancery]] of the [[Latin Church]].

The modern name of Russia (''Rossija''), which came into use in the 15th century,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Boris Kloss]]. О происхождении названия “Россия”. М.: Рукописные памятники Древней Руси, 2012. С. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="E. Hellberg-Hirn 1998. P. 54"&gt;E. Hellberg-Hirn. Soil and Soul: The Symbolic World of Russianness. Ashgate, 1998. P. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawrence N. Langer 2001. P. 186"&gt;Lawrence N. Langer. Historical Dictionary of Medieval Russia. Scarecrow Press, 2001. P. 186&lt;/ref&gt; is derived from the Greek ''Ρωσία'', which in turn derives from ''Ῥῶς'', an early Greek name for the people of Rus'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Russians: The People of Europe |last=Milner-Gulland |first=R. R. |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location= |isbn=9780631218494 |pages=1–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BgJjHFwmj2UC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hypothetical  predecessor of Kievan Rus' is the 9th-century [[Rus' Khaganate]], whose name and existence are inferred from a handful of early medieval [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] sources that mention that the Rus' were governed by a [[khagan]].

According to the most prominent theory, the name Rus', like the Finnish name for [[Sweden]] (''Ruotsi''), is derived from an [[Old Norse]] term for "the men who row" (''rods-'') as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of [[Roslagen]] (the rowing crews) or ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'', as it was known in earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vFRug14ui7gC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=varangians+finnic#v=onepage&amp;q=%22this%20traffic%20originated%20mainly%20in%20sweden%22&amp;f=false | title = The Varangians of Byzantium | isbn = 978-0-521-03552-1 | author1 = Benedikz | first1 = Benedikt S | date = 2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Russian Primary Chronicle: Laurentian Text Translated by O. P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor {{ISBN|0-910956-34-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name Rus' would then have the same origin as the [[Finland|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Võro language|Võro]] and [[Northern Sami]] names for Sweden: ''Ruotsi'', ''Rootsi'', ''Roodsi'' and ''Ruoŧŧa''.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;"[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Russia Russia]," [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is remarkable enough that the local [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and [[Permic languages|Permic]] peoples in northern Russia proper use the same (''Rus{{'}}''-related) name both for [[Sweden]] and [[Russia]] (depending on the language): thus the [[Veps language|Veps]] name for [[Sweden]] and Swedish is ''Ročinma'' / ''Ročin'',&lt;ref name="Veps"&gt;"Зайцева М. И., Муллонен М. И. Словарь вепсского языка (Dictionary of Veps language). Л., «Наука», 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the neighboring [[Komi language]] the etymologically corresponding term  ''Ročmu'' / ''Roč'' means already [[Russia]] and Russian instead.&lt;ref name="Komi"&gt;Zyri͡ansko-russkīĭ i russko-zyri͡anskīĭ slovarʹ (Komi - Russian dictionary) / sostavlennyĭ Pavlom Savvaitovym.

The Danish scholar [[:fi:Tor Karsten|Tor Karsten]] has pointed out that the territory of present-day [[Uppland]], [[Södermanland]] and [[Östergötland|East Gothland]] in ancient times was known as ''Roðer'' or ''roðin''. Thomsen accordingly has suggested that ''Roðer'' probably  derived from ''roðsmenn'' or ''roðskarlar'', meaning seafarers or rowers.&lt;ref name="RPC"&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|url=http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/dokumente/a/a011458.pdf|title=The Russian Primary Chronicle: Laurentian Text|translator1=Samuel Hazzard Cross|editor1=Samuel Hazzard Cross|translator2=Olgerd P.

[[George Vernadsky]] theoretized about the association of Rus and [[Alans]]. He claimed that ''Ruxs'' in [[Alanic language|Alanic]] means "radiant light", thus the ethnonym ''Roxolani'' could be understood as "bright Alans".&lt;ref name="Vernadsky1959"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Vernadsky|title=The Origins of Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPHTAAAAMAAJ|year=1959|publisher=Clarendon Press|quote=In the Sarmatian period the Rus' were closely associated with the Alans.

=== Early evidence ===
In [[Old East Slavic]] literature, the [[East Slavs]] refer to themselves as "''[muzhi] ruskie''" ("Rus' men") or, rarely, "''rusichi''."  The East Slavs are thought to have adopted this name from the [[Varangians|Varangian]] elite, which was first mentioned in the 830s in the ''Annales Bertiniani''. The ''Annales'' recount that [[Louis the Pious]]'s court at [[Ingelheim am Rhein]] in 839 (the same year as the first appearance of [[Varangians]] in [[Constantinople]]), was visited by a delegation from the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]]. The delegates included two men who called themselves "''Rhos''" ("Rhos vocari dicebant"). Louis inquired about their origins and learned that they were Swedes. Fearing that they were spies for their brothers the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], he jailed them. They were also mentioned in the 860s by Byzantine Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] under the name, "''Rhos''."

''Rusiyyah'' was used by [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] for Varangians near [[Astrakhan]], and by the [[Persian people|Persian]] traveler [[Ahmad ibn Rustah]] who visited [[Veliky Novgorod]] and described how the Rus' exploited the Slavs.
{{quote|As for the Rus, they live on an island ... that takes three days to walk round and is covered with thick undergrowth and forests; it is most unhealthy... They harry the Slavs, using ships to reach them; they carry them off as slaves and... sell them. They have no fields but simply live on what they get from the Slav's lands... When a son is born, the father will go up to the newborn baby, sword in hand; throwing it down, he says, "I shall not leave you with any property: You have only what you can provide with this weapon."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad ibn Rustah]], according to ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', March 1985&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the Varangians arrived in [[Constantinople]], the Byzantines considered and described the ''Rhos'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''Ῥῶς'') as a different people from the Slavs.

The earliest written mention of the word ''Rus{{'}}'' or ''Rus'ian/Russian'' appears in the ''Primary Chronicle'' under the year 912. When describing a peace treaty signed by the Varangian [[Oleg of Novgorod]] during his [[Rus'-Byzantine War (907)|campaign on Constantinople]], it contains the following passage, "Oleg sent his men to make peace and sign a treaty between the Greeks and the Rus', saying thus: [...] "We are the Rus': Karl, Inegeld, Farlaf, Veremud, Rulav, Gudi, Ruald, Karn, Frelav, Ruar, Aktevu, Truan, Lidul, Vost, Stemid, sent by Oleg, the great prince of Rus', and all those under him[.]"{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Later, the Primary Chronicle tells us, they conquered [[Kiev]] and created [[Kievan Rus']]. The territory they conquered was named after them as were, eventually, the local people (''cf''. [[Normans]]).

However, the Synod Scroll of the ''[[Novgorod First Chronicle]]'', which is partly based on the original list of the late 11th Century and partly on the Primary Chronicle, does not name the [[Varangians]] asked by the Chuds, Slavs and Krivichs to reign their obstreperous lands as the "Rus'". One can assume that there was no original mention of the Varangians as the Rus' due to the old list predating the Primary Chronicle and the Synod Scroll only referred to the Primary Chronicle if the pages of the old list were blemished.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Other spellings used in Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries were as follows: ''Ruzi'', ''[[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Ruzzi]]'', ''Ruzia'' and ''Ruzari''. But perhaps the most popular{{cn|date=June 2018}} term to refer to the Rus' was ''[[Rugii]]'', a name of the ancient [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribe]] related to the [[Goths]]. [[Olga of Kiev]], for instance, was called in the Frankish annals ''regina Rugorum'', that is, "the Queen of the Rugi."

===Alternate anti-Normanist theories===
A number of alternative etymologies have been suggested. These are derived from the "anti-Normanist" school of thought in [[Russian historiography]] during the 19th century and in the [[Soviet era]]. These hypotheses are considered unlikely in Western mainstream academia.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com" /&gt;
Slavic and Iranian etymologies suggested by "anti-Normanist" scholars include:
* The ''[[Roxolani]]'', a [[Sarmatian]] (i. e., [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]) people who inhabited southern Ukraine, Moldova and Romania;{{cn|date=April 2018}}
* Several river-names in the region contain the element ''rus''/''ros'' and these might be the origin of the name of the Rus'.&lt;ref&gt;P.B., Golden, “Rūs”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Second Edition, Edited by: P.

(A relation of ''rosa'' to the [[Sanskrit]] ''rasā́-'' "liquid, juice; mythical river" suggests itself; compare [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''Raŋhā'' "mythical stream" and the ancient name of the [[Volga River]], Ῥᾶ ''Rā'', from a cognate [[Scythian languages|Scythian]] name.){{cn|date=April 2018}}

* A postulated proto-Slavic word for "[[bear]]", cognate with ''arctos'' and ''ursus''.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The name ''Rus''' may have originated from the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] name of the [[Volga River]] (by F. Knauer, Moscow 1901), as well as from the Rosh of [[Ezekiel]].&lt;ref&gt;For the most thorough summary of this option see, Jon Ruthven, ''The Prophecy That Is Shaping History: New Research on Ezekiel's Vision of the End.'' Fairfax, VA: Xulon Press, 2003, 55-96. {{ISBN|1-59160-214-9}} {{cite web |url=http://www.jon-ruthven.org/rosh.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726010152/http://www.jon-ruthven.org/rosh.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. [[George Vernadsky]] has suggested a derivation from the [[Roxolani]] or from the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Aryan]] term ''ronsa''{{Verify source|reason=Does the source really say "ronsa"? Looks like a misspelling. Where does the "n" come from, for example?|date=August 2015}} (moisture, water).  River names such as [[Ros River|Ros]] are common in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="RPC"/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

The Russian linguist [[Igor Danilevsky]], in his ''Ancient Rus as Seen by Contemporaries and Descendants'', argued against these theories, stating that the anti-Normanists neglected the realities of the Ancient Slavic languages and that the nation name ''Rus&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' could not have arisen from any of the proposed origins.{{cn|date=April 2018}}
* The populace of the [[Ros River]] would have been known as ''Roshane'';
* [[red hair|Red-haired]] or bear-origined people would have ended their self-name with the plural ''-ane'' or ''-ichi'', and not with the singular ''-s&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (red hair is one of the natural hair colors of Scandinavians and other [[Germanic peoples]]);
* Most theories are based on a ''Ros-'' root, and in Ancient Slavic an ''o'' would never have become the ''u'' in ''Rus&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''.

Danilevskiy further argued{{cn|date=April 2018}} that the term followed the general pattern of Slavic names for neighboring [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]] peoples—the ''[[Chud|Chud']]'', ''[[Vepsians|Ves']]'', ''[[Permic languages|Perm']]'', ''[[Finns|Sum']]'', etc.—but that the only possible word that it could be based on, ''Ruotsi'', presented a historical dead-end, since no such tribal or national name was known from non-Slavic sources. "Ruotsi" is, however, the Finnish name for [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:fi:Ruotsi|Ruotsi - Wikipedia (FI)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Danilevskiy shows that the oldest historical source, the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', is inconsistent in what it refers to as the "Rus'": in adjacent passages, the Rus' are grouped with [[Varangians]], with the Slavs, and also set apart from the Slavs and Varangians. Danilevskiy suggests that the ''Rus&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' were originally not a nation but a [[social class]], which can explain the irregularities in the ''Primary Chronicle'' and the lack of early non-Slavic sources.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== From Rus' to Russia ==
In modern English historiography, Kievan Rus{{'}} is the most common name for the ancient East Slavic state (usually retaining the apostrophe in ''Rus{{'}}'', a transliteration of the [[soft sign]], ь)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vyFpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=apostrophe+soft+sign+rus Echoes of glasnost in Soviet Ukraine], by Romana M. Bahry, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; followed by "Kievan Rus{{'}}", "Kievan Russia", "ancient Russian state", and, extremely rarely, "Kievan Ruthenia". It is also called the ''Princedom'' or ''Principality of Kiev'', or just ''Kiev''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The term ''Kievan Rus''' was established by modern historians to distinguish the period from the 9th century to the beginning of the 12th century, when Kiev was the center of a large state.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Harley and D. Woodward, eds., The History of Cartography, Volume III, Part 1. P. 1852. Note 3. University of Chicago Press, Chicago &amp; London. 2007. ISBN-10: 0-226-90733-3, ISBN-13: 978-0-226-90733-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast political state was subsequently divided into several parts. The most influential were, in the south, [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] and in the north, [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] and the [[Novgorod Republic]]. The southern part fell under Polish and Lithuanian influence; the northern part, under much weaker Mongol influence,{{clarify|reason=What does 'under weaker Mongol influence' apply to? Needs qualification.|date=October 2014}} went on to become a loose federation of principalities.

Patriarch [[Callistus I of Constantinople]] in 1361 created two metropolitan sees with their own names (in [[Greek language|Greek]]) for the northern and southern parts: respectively, {{lang|el|Μεγάλη Ῥωσσία}} (''Megálē Rhōssía'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vasmer |first=Max |author-link=Max Vasmer |title=Etymological Dictionary of the Russian Language |publisher=Progress |year=1986 |location=Moscow |page=289 |url=http://etymolog.ruslang.ru/vasmer.php?id=289&amp;vol=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815210611/http://etymolog.ruslang.ru/vasmer.php?id=289&amp;vol=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Great Russia]]) in Vladimir and Kiev and {{lang|el|Μικρὰ Ῥωσσία}} (''Mikrà Rhōssía'', Russia Minor or [[Little Russia]]) with the centers in Galich (Halych) and Novgorodok (Navahrudak).

By the 15th century, the rulers of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] had reunited the northern parts of the former Kievan Rus'. [[Ivan III of Russia]] was the first local ruler to be proclaimed "Grand Prince of all Rus'" (similarly, see Ivan I of Moscow and the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']]). This title was used by the Grand Dukes of Vladimir since the early 14th century, and the first prince to use it was [[Mikhail of Tver]]. Ivan III was styled by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] as {{lang|la|rex albus}} and {{lang|la|rex Russiae}}. Later, ''Rus’'' — in the [[Russian language]] specifically — evolved into the Byzantine-influenced form, ''Rossiya'' (Russia is {{lang|el|Ῥωσσία}} (''Rhōssía'') in Greek).

In 1547, Ivan IV assumed the title of “Tsar and Grand Duke [[of all Rus']]” (Царь и Великий князь всея Руси) and was crowned on 16 January,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Auty, Dimitri Obolensky.

According to  historians like [[Alexander Zimin]] and [[Anna Khoroshkevich]], the continuous use of the term ''Moscovia'' was a result of traditional habit and the need to distinguish between the Muscovite and the Lithuanian part of the Rus', as well as of the political interests of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which competed with Moscow for the western regions of the Rus'.

== From Rus' to Ruthenia ==
The southern territories of the Rus' fell under the rule of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in the 13th century.
While Russian descendants of the Rus' called themselves Russkiye, the residents of these lands called themselves Rusyny or Ruskiye. The name ''[[Ruthenia]]'' arises as a latinized form of the name ''Rus' '' in Western European documents at about this time.

The territories under Lithuanian rule retained the name ''Rus' '', specifically
* [[White Ruthenia|"White Rus"]] (''Ruthenia Alba'', ''Belarus'', ''Ruś Biała'')
* [[Black Ruthenia|"Black Rus"]] (''Ruthenia Nigra'', ''Chorna Rus'', ''Ruś Czarna'')
* [[Red Ruthenia|"Red Rus"]] (''Ruthenia Rubra'', ''Chervona Rus'', ''Ruś Czerwona'')

Application of the name "Ruthenia" became narrowed to [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] (''Karpats’ka Rus’''), south of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the Kingdom of [[Hungary]], where many local Slavs consider themselves ''[[Rusyns]]''. Carpathian Ruthenia incorporated the cities of [[Mukachevo]] ({{lang-hu|Munkács}}), [[Uzhhorod]] ({{lang-hu|Ungvár}}) and [[Prešov]] (''Pryashiv'';  {{lang-hu|Eperjes}}). Carpathian Rus' had been part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] since 907, and had been known as "Magna Rus'" but was also called "Karpato-Rus’" or "Zakarpattya".

==Little Russia, New Russia==
In 1654, under the [[Pereyaslav Agreement]], the [[Cossacks|Cossack]] lands of the [[Zaporozhian Host]] were signed into the [[Protectorate#Colonial protection|protectorate]] of the [[Tsardom of Russia]], including the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] of [[Left-bank Ukraine]], and [[Zaporizhia (region)|Zaporozhia]]. In Russia, these lands were referred to as [[Little Russia]] (''Malorossiya''). Colonies established in lands ceded from the [[Ottoman Empire]] along the [[Black Sea]] were called [[Novorossiya]] "New Russia".

'''Novi Zagreb''' ("New Zagreb") is the part of the City of [[Zagreb]] located south of the [[Sava|Sava river]]. Novi Zagreb forms a distinct whole because it is separated from the northern part of the city both by the river and by the levees around Sava. At the same time, it is divided on urban and rural part.

It is mostly residential, consisting of blocks of [[Apartment|flats]] and [[tower block]]s that were built during the [[Socialist]] era (1945–1990). Although it is not as prestigious as downtown Zagreb, it has been praised for its good road network, public transportation connections and abundance of parks.

By 2009 administrative division it is divided into three administrative [[city district]]s ("četvrti"): ''[[Novi Zagreb - istok]]'' (East Novi Zagreb), ''[[Novi Zagreb - zapad]]'' (West Novi Zagreb) and ''[[Brezovica, Zagreb|Brezovica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zagreb.hr/granice-podrucja-gradskih-cetvrti/12917|title=City of Zagreb administrative districts map|accessdate=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion of Novi Zagreb was started by the Zagreb mayor [[Većeslav Holjevac]], when he moved the [[Zagreb Fair]] from the downtown Savska Road to the southern bank of the Sava river in 1953. In 1957 first plans for developing Novi Zagreb were introduced, depicting what would later be known as [[Savski Gaj]]. The first complete solution for habitation with public and commercial contents was made for the neighborhood [[Trnsko]] by urbanists [[Zdenko Kolacio]], [[Mirko Maretić]] and [[Josip Uhlik]] with horticulturist [[Mira Wenzler-Halambek]] in 1959-1960. It was followed by plans for neighborhood [[Zapruđe]] in 1962-1963, also made by Josip Uhlik.&lt;ref name=Leksikon&gt;''Zagrebački leksikon'' (knjiga druga). "LZMK", Zagreb 2006. godina, 129.-130. str.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revitalization of Novi Zagreb began in early 2000 with numerous projects that are either completed or still ongoing. Completed projects include the construction of [[Arena Zagreb]] in the [[Lanište, Croatia|Lanište]] neighborhood in [[Novi Zagreb - zapad]], along with the [[Arena Centar]] shopping and entertainment complex and the numerous adjacent new residential and commercial buildings, parks and plazas, the construction of the new building of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb|Museum of Modern Art]], construction of the [[Avenue Mall]] shopping center, renovation of the [[Bundek]] park and lake along with the organization of the [[Bundekfest]] festival, and the construction of  the "Bundek Centar" residential and commercial complex. Projects that are still in the planning stages are the construction of a new hospital center in [[Blato, Zagreb|Blato]] neighborhood, construction of a new bridge spanning the [[Sava]] river and connecting the [[Jarun]] neighborhood with Novi Zagreb, expansion of the [[Zagrebački električni tramvaj|public transportation network]] with new tram lines, construction of a new and larger city zoo and the construction of a new office zone with [[highrise]] buildings.

[[File:Arrian, Periplus.jpg|thumb|Beginning of the Arrian Periplous Euxeinou Pontou of Johann Froben and Nicolaus Episcopius, Basel 1533]]
A '''periplus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛr|ɪ|p|l|ʌ|s}}) is a manuscript document that lists the ports and coastal landmarks, in order and with approximate intervening distances, that the captain of a vessel could expect to find along a shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Source Book in Geography|first=George|last=Kish|page=21|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1978|isbn=0-674-82270-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6qF4vjZvhYC }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense the periplus was a type of log. It served the same purpose as the later Roman [[itinerarium]] of road stops; however, the Greek navigators added various notes, which if they were professional geographers (as many were) became part of their own additions to Greek geography.

The form of the ''periplus'' is at least as old as the earliest Greek historian, the Ionian [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. The works of [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] contain passages that appear to have been based on ''peripli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=40|title=Josephus Geographicus: The Classical Context of Geography in Josephus|first=Yuval|last=Shahar|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2004|isbn=3-16-148256-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIJLJSYFogUC&amp;pg=PA40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Periplus'' is the Latinization of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word περίπλους (''periplous'', contracted from περίπλοος ''periploos''), is "a sailing-around." Both segments, ''peri-'' and ''-plous'', were independently [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]]: the ancient Greek speaker understood the word in its literal sense; however, it developed a few specialized meanings, one of which became a standard term in the ancient navigation of [[Phoenicians]], [[Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

==Known ''peripli''==
Several examples of ''peripli'' that are known to scholars:

=== Carthaginian ===

*The Periplus of [[Himilco the Navigator]], parts which are preserved in [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Avienus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Purcell (classicist)|Nicholas Purcell]] "Himilco" in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' 3rd. ed. [[Oxford]]; [[Oxford University Press]] 1999 p.707&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Hanno the Navigator#Periplus account|Periplus]] of [[Hanno the Navigator]], [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] colonist and explorer who explored the coast of [[Africa]] from present-day [[Morocco]] southward at least as far as [[Senegal]] in the sixth or fifth century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |translator-first=H. |translator-last=Schoff |title=The Periplus of Hanno a voyage of discovery down the west African coast |year=1912 |url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6541953M/The_Periplus_of_Hanno }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek ===

*The ''Periplus'' of the Greek [[Scylax of Caryanda]], in Caria, who allegedly sailed down the [[Indus River]] and then to [[Suez]] on the initiative of [[Darius I]]. This voyage is mentioned by [[Herodotus]], and his pleriplus is quoted by Hecataeus of Miletus, [[Aristotle]], [[Strabo]] and Avienus.&lt;ref&gt;"Scylax" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1374&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Massaliote Periplus]]'', a description of trade routes along the coasts of [[Atlantic Europe]], by anonymous Greek navigators of Massalia (now Marseille, France), possibly dates to the sixth century BCE, also preserved in Avienus&lt;ref&gt;"Periploi" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1141&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pytheas of Massilia]], (fourth century BCE) ''On the Ocean'' (Περί του Ωκεανού), has not survived; only excerpts remain, quoted or paraphrased by later authors, including Strabo, [[Diodorus Siculus]], Pliny the Elder  and in Avienus' ''Ora maritima''.&lt;ref&gt;"Pytheas" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1285&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]]'', generally is thought to date to the fourth or third century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;"Scylax" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1374&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Pleriplus of [[Nearchus]] surveyed the area between the Indus and the Persian Gulf under orders from [[Alexander the Great]]. He was a source for Strabo and [[Arrian]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;"Periploi" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1141&lt;/ref&gt;
*''On the Red Sea'' by [[Agatharchides]]. Fragments preserved in Diodorus Siculus and [[Photius]].&lt;ref&gt;"Agatharchides" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.36&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Periplus of [[Scymnus]] of [[Chios]] is dated to around 110&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;"Scymnus" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.137436&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' or Red Sea was written by a Greek of the Hellenistic/Romanized [[Alexandria]]n in the first century CE. It provides a shoreline itinerary of the [[Red Sea|Red (Erythraean) Sea]], starting at the port of [[Berenice (port)|Berenice]]. Beyond the Red Sea, the manuscript describes the coast of India as far as the [[Ganges River]] and the east coast of Africa (called [[Azania]]). The unknown author of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'' claims that Hippalus, a mariner, was knowledgeable about the "monsoon winds" that shorten the round-trip from India to the Red Sea.{{sfn|Liu|2010|p=34}} Also according to the manuscript, the Horn of Africa was called, "the Cape of Spices,"{{sfn|Liu|2010|p=36}} and modern day Yemen was known as the "Frankincense Country."{{sfn|Liu|2010|p=37}}
*The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini]]'', a description of trade routes along the coasts of the [[Black Sea]], written by [[Arrian]] (in Greek Αρριανός) in the early second century CE.

==''Rahnāmag''==
[[Persia]]n sailors had long had their own sailing guide books, called ''Rahnāmag'' in [[Middle Persian]] (''Rahnāmeh'' رهنامه in [[Modern Persian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dehkhoda |first=Ali Akbar |first2=Mohammad |last2=Moʻin |year=1958 |title=Loghat-namehʻi Dehkhoda |location=Tehran |publisher=Tehran University Press: Rahnāma }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They listed the ports and coastal landmarks and distances along the shores.

The lost but much-cited sailing directions go back at least to the 12th century. Some described the [[Indian Ocean]] as "a hard sea to get out of" and warned of the "circumambient sea," with all return impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Civilizations: Culture, Ambition, and the Transformation of Nature |first=Felipe |last=Fernandez-Armesto |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-7432-0248-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJcSAQAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactic of naval combat==
A ''periplus'' was also an ancient naval manoeuvre in which attacking ''[[triremes]]'' would outflank or encircle the defenders to attack them in the rear.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A '''pole of inaccessibility''' with respect to a [[geography|geographical]] criterion of inaccessibility marks a location that is the most challenging to reach according to that criterion. Often it refers to the most distant point from the coastline, implying a maximum degree of continentality or oceanity. In these cases, pole of inaccessibility can be defined as the center of the largest circle that can be drawn within an area of interest without encountering a [[coast]]. Where a coast is imprecisely defined, the pole will be similarly imprecise.

==Northern pole of inaccessibility==

The northern pole of inaccessibility, sometimes known as the Arctic pole of inaccessibility, or just Arctic pole, is located on the [[Arctic Ocean]] [[pack ice]] at a distance farthest from any land mass. It lies at {{Coord|85|48|N|176|9|W|name=True Northern Pole of Inaccessibility}}, {{convert|1008|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the three closest landmasses: [[Ellesmere Island]], [[Komsomolets Island]], and [[Henrietta Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duhaime-Ross|first=Arielle|date=15 October 2013|title=A New Race to Earth's End|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v309/n5/full/scientificamerican1113-16a.html|journal=Scientific American|volume=309|issue=16|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1113-16a|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to constant motion of the pack ice, no permanent structure can exist at this pole.

Until a 2013 review of satellite cartography, the northern pole of inaccessibility was thought to lie at {{Coord|84|03|N|174|51|W|name=Old Northern Pole of Inaccessibility}},{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}  which was {{convert|1,094|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from Ellesmere, [[Franz-Josef Land]], and the [[New Siberian Islands]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} {{convert|1,453|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} and {{convert|214|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the actual northern pole of inaccessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/story/forget-the-north-polethis-is-the-real-end-of-the-earth|title=Forget the North Pole—This Is the Real End of the Earth|last=Jennings|first=Ken|date=October 23, 2017|work=Condé Nast Traveler|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109063818/https://www.cntraveler.com/story/forget-the-north-polethis-is-the-real-end-of-the-earth|archivedate=January 9, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to reach this false northern pole of inaccessibility was made by Sir [[Hubert Wilkins]], who flew by [[aircraft]] in 1927. 

In 1941, the first Soviet expedition using an airplane landed 350 kilometers north of the false northern pole, thus actually becoming the first expedition to reach the real pole.

Ignoring Soviet results, [[Wally Herbert|Sir Wally Herbert]] claimed to be the first to reach what was then considered to be the northern pole of inaccessibility on foot, arriving by [[dogsled]] in 1968. Explorer [[Jim McNeill, Polar Explorer|Jim McNeill]] claimed in 2006 that Herbert did not quite make the pole, and launched his own unsuccessful attempt to reach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4731672.stm|title=Explorer set for historic Arctic adventure|last=|first=|date=20 February 2006|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=10 November 2010|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527193017/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4731672.stm|archivedate=27 May 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, an expedition of Soviet polar scientists led by Dmitry Shparo reached the pole of inaccessibility by foot during a polar night.

As of 2010, McNeill said that no one had reached the false northern pole of inaccessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theadventureblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/north-pole-2010-expedition-to-pole-of.html|title=North Pole 2010: Expedition To The Pole of Inaccessibility is Postponed|last=Becker|first=Kraig|date=10 February 2010|publisher=The Adventure Blog|work=theadventureblog.blogspot.com|accessdate=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013054113/http://theadventureblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/north-pole-2010-expedition-to-pole-of.html|archivedate=13 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southern pole of inaccessibility==

[[Image:Southern Pol of Inaccessibility Henry Cookson team n2i.JPG|thumb|left|The old Soviet Pole of Inaccessibility Station, revisited by [[Henry_Cookson#Team_N2i|Team N2i]] on 19 January 2007]]

The southern pole of inaccessibility is the point on the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] continent most distant from the [[Southern Ocean]]. A variety of coordinate locations have been given for this pole. The discrepancies are due to the question of whether the "coast" is measured to the grounding line or to the edges of ice shelves, the difficulty of determining the location of the "solid" coastline, the movement of ice sheets and improvements in the accuracy of survey data over the years, as well as possible topographical errors.

The pole of inaccessibility commonly refers to the site of the [[Pole of inaccessibility (Antarctic research station)|Soviet Union research station]] mentioned below, which was constructed at {{Coord|82|06|S|54|58|E|name=Pole of Inaccessibility (WMO)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/Antarctica/Ant-cat-Rus-Fed.html|title=Catalogue of Russian Antarctic Meteorological data 1994|last=Danilov|first=A.I.|date=|website=wmo.int|publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|access-date=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513160724/http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/Antarctica/Ant-cat-Rus-Fed.html|archivedate=13 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though some sources give {{Coord|83|06|S|54|58|E|name=South Pole of Inaccessibility (IPHC)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polarheritage.com/index.cfm/Sitelist01up|title=Historic Sites &amp; Monuments in Antarctica|last=|first=|date=2016|website=polarheritage.com|publisher=International Polar Heritage Committee|access-date=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929161454/http://www.polarheritage.com/index.cfm/Sitelist01up|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This lies {{convert|878|km|abbr=on}} from the [[South Pole]], at an [[elevation]] of {{convert|3,718|m|abbr=on}}. Using different criteria, the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] locates this pole at {{Coord|85|50|S|65|47|E|name=South Pole of Inaccessibility (SPRI)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/resources/infosheets/23.html|title=Polar Information Sheets|last=Headland|first=R.K.|date=1996|website=spri.cam.ac.uk|publisher=[[Scott Polar Research Institute]], [[University of Cambridge]]|access-date=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528131216/http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/resources/infosheets/23.html|archivedate=28 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''ThePoles.com'', the point farthest from the sea accounting only for the Antarctic land surface proper is at {{Coord|82|53|14|S|55|4|30|E|name=point farthest from the sea}}, and the farthest point when ice sheets are taken into account is {{Coord|83|50|37|S|65|43|30|E|name=point farthest from the sea counting ice}}. These points, calculated by the [[British Antarctic Survey]], are quoted as being "the most accurate measure available" (as of 2005).&lt;ref name="thepoles.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/polar/news.php?id=1298|title=Spaniards reach the 'second' South Pole of Inaccessibility – still no trace of Lenin|last=|first=|date=15 December 2005|website=explorersweb.com|publisher=ThePoles.com|access-date=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414194423/http://www.explorersweb.com/polar/news.php?id=1298|archivedate=14 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern pole of inaccessibility is far more remote and difficult to reach than the [[geographic South Pole]]. On 14 December 1958, the [[3rd Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] for [[International Geophysical Year]] research work, led by [[Yevgeny Tolstikov]], established the temporary [[Pole of inaccessibility (Antarctic research station)|Pole of Inaccessibility Station]] (''Polyus Nedostupnosti'') at {{Coord|82|06|S|54|58|E|name=Pole of Inaccessibility Station}}. A second Russian team returned there in 1967. Today, a building still remains at this location, marked by a bust of [[Vladimir Lenin]] that faces towards [[Moscow]], and protected as a historical site. Inside the building, there is a golden visitors' book for those who make it to the site to sign.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

On 4 December 2006, Team N2i, consisting of [[Henry Cookson]], Rupert Longsdon, Rory Sweet and [[Paul Landry]], embarked on an expedition to be the first to reach the historic pole of inaccessibility location without direct mechanical assistance, using a combination of traditional [[Manhauling|man hauling]] and [[kite skiing]]. The team reached the old abandoned station on 20 January 2007, rediscovering the forgotten statue of Lenin left there by the Soviets some 48 years previously. The explorers were picked up from the spot by a plane from [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] base, flown to [[Progress Base]] and taken back to [[Cape Town]] on the ''[[Akademik Fyodorov]]'', a Russian polar research vessel.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6281839.stm|title=UK team makes polar trek history|last=|first=|date=20 January 2007|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC News]]|access-date=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122051626/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6281839.stm|archivedate=22 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team found that only the bust on top of the building remained visible; the rest was buried under the snow.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

On 11 December 2005, at 7:57 UTC, [[Ramón Hernando de Larramendi]], Juan Manuel Viu, and Ignacio Oficialdegui, members of the Spanish Transantarctic Expedition, reached for the first time in history the southern pole of inaccessibility at {{Coord|82|53|14|S|55|04|30|E|name=British Antarctic Survey-accredited Pole of Inaccessibility}}, updated that year by the British Antarctic Survey. The team continued their journey towards the second southern pole of inaccessibility, the one that accounts for the ice shelves as well as the continental land, and they were the first expedition to reach it, on 14 December 2005, at {{Coord|83|50|37|S|65|43|30|E|name=British Antarctic Survey-accredited Pole of Inaccessibility}}. Both achievements took place within an ambitious pioneer crossing of the eastern Antarctic Plateau that started at [[Novolazerevskaya Base]] and ended at Progress Base after more than {{convert|4,500|km|abbr=on}}. This was the fastest polar journey ever achieved without mechanical aid, with an average rate of around {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} per day and a maximum of {{convert|311|km|abbr=on}} per day, using kites as their power source.&lt;ref name="thepoles.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoles.com/news.php?id=1276|title=Polar News ExplorersWeb – Spaniards reach South Pole of Inaccessibility – but where is Lenin?|last=|first=|date=12 December 2012|website=explorersweb.com|publisher=ThePoles.com|accessdate=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321061128/http://www.thepoles.com/news.php?id=1276|archivedate=21 March 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrabes.com/actualidad/noticias/1-4549/alcanzado-polo-sur-inaccesibilidad.html|title=Reached the South Pole of Inaccessibility|last=|first=|date=13 December 2005|website=Barrabes.com|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110173042/http://www.barrabes.com/actualidad/noticias/1-4549/alcanzado-polo-sur-inaccesibilidad.html|archivedate=10 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tierraspolares.es/trineodeviento/ramon-h-larramendi/|title=The South Pole of Inaccessibility|last=|first=|date=|website=tierraspolares.es|publisher=Tierras Polares|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111011301/http://www.tierraspolares.es/catamaran/inaccesibilidad_i.htm|archive-date=11 January 2009|dead-url=yes|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 December 2011, [[Sebastian Copeland]] and partner Eric McNair-Laundry also reached the {{Coord|82|06|S|54|58|E|name=Pole of Inaccessibility Station}} southern pole of inaccessibility. They were the first to do so without resupply or mechanical support, departing from [[Novolazerevskaya Base]] on their way to the [[South Pole]] to complete the first East/West crossing of Antarctica through both poles, over 4,000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/polar/news.php?id=20632|title=Polar News ExplorersWeb – ExWeb interview Sebastian Copeland and Eric McNair-Landry (part 1/2): The battle of body and gear across 2 South Poles|last=|first=|date=5 March 2012|website=Explorersweb.com|publisher=ExWeb|accessdate=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529035501/http://www.explorersweb.com/polar/news.php?id=20632|archivedate=29 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, due to improvements in technology and the position of the continental edge of Antarctica being debated, the exact position of our best estimate of the pole of inaccessibility may vary. However, for the convenience of sport expeditions, a fixed point is preferred, and the Soviet station has been used for this role. This has been recognised by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' in regard to Team N2i's expedition in 2006–2007.&lt;ref name="teamn2i"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamn2i.com/media/files/guinness_book_records_team_n2i_antarctic_ec1.jpg|title=Image: guinness_book_records_team_n2i_antarctic_ec1.jpg, (539 × 791 px)|last=|first=|date=19 January 2007|website=teamn2i.com|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514041543/http://www.teamn2i.com/media/files/guinness_book_records_team_n2i_antarctic_ec1.jpg|archivedate=14 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanic pole of inaccessibility==
[[Image:Oceanic pole of inaccessibility.png|thumb|Oceanic pole of inaccessibility at 48° 52′ 36″S 123° 23′ 36″W]]

The oceanic pole of inaccessibility ({{Coord|48|52.6|S|123|23.6|W|name=Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility}}) is the place in the ocean that is farthest from land. It lies in the [[South Pacific Ocean]], {{Convert|2688|km|abbr=on}} from the nearest lands: [[Ducie Island]] (part of the [[Pitcairn Island]]s) in the north, [[Motu Nui]] (part of the [[Easter Island]]s) in the northeast, and [[Maher Island]] (near the larger [[Siple Island]], off the coast of [[Marie Byrd Land]], Antarctica) in the south.

Known as "'''Point Nemo'''", Nemo being Latin for "no one" and also a reference to [[Jules Verne]]'s [[Captain Nemo]]{{fact|date=November 2018}}, it lies more than 1,400 [[nautical miles]] from the nearest land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocuriosa.com/pointnemo/index.html|title=Point Nemo (or, One Thousand and Four Hundred Miles from Anywhere)|last=Lukatela|first=Hrvoje|date=26 March 2004|website=geocuriosa.com|publisher=The GlobeCalc Project|access-date=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160613160938/http://www.geocuriosa.com/pointnemo/index.html|archivedate=13 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point was featured in the short story, ''[[The Call of Cthulhu]]'', by [[H.

==Continental poles of inaccessibility==

===Eurasia===
[[File:Distance to the sea in Asia.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Distance to the sea in Asia, showing the two candidate locations for Eurasian Pole of Inaccessibility.]]
In [[Eurasia]], the Continental Pole of Inaccessibility is the place on land that is farthest from the ocean, and it lies in northwestern [[China]], near the [[Kazakhstan]] border. 

Earlier calculations suggested that it is {{convert|2,645|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the nearest coastline, located at {{Coord|46|17|N|86|40|E|name=Proposed Continental Pole of Inaccessibility}}, approximately {{convert|320|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the city of [[Ürümqi]], in the [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Autonomous Region]] of [[China]], in the [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]]. The nearest settlements to this location are [[Hoxtolgay]] [[Town (PRC)|Town]] at {{Coord|46|34|N|85|58|E|name=Hoxtolgay}}, about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest, Xazgat [[Township (PRC)|Township]] ({{zh|s=[[:zh:夏孜盖乡|夏孜盖乡]]|p=Xiàzīgài xiāng}}) at {{Coord|46|20|N|86|22|E|name=Xazgat}}, about {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west, and [[Suluk, Xinjiang|Suluk]] at {{Coord|46|15|N|86|50|E|name=Suluk}}, about {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

However, the previous pole location disregards the [[Gulf of Ob]] as part of the oceans, and a recent study&lt;ref name="PIA"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/14702540801897809 |volume=123 |issue=3 |pages=227–233 |last=Garcia-Castellanos |first=Daniel |first2=Umberto |last2=Lombardo |title=Poles of Inaccessibility: A Calculation Algorithm for the Remotest Places on Earth |journal=Scottish Geographical Journal |accessdate=10 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629230429/http://cuba.ija.csic.es/~danielgc/papers/Garcia-Castellanos,%20Lombardo,%202007,%20SGJ.pdf|archive-date=29 June 2014|dead-url=yes|date=September 2007 |url=http://cuba.ija.csic.es/~danielgc/papers/Garcia-Castellanos,%20Lombardo,%202007,%20SGJ.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes two other locations as the ones farther from any ocean (within the uncertainty of coastline definition): EPIA1 {{Coord|44.29|N|82.19|E}} and EPIA2 {{Coord|45.28|N|88.14|E}}, located respectively at 2,510±10&amp;nbsp;km (1560±6&amp;nbsp;mi) and 2,514±7&amp;nbsp;km (1,562±4&amp;nbsp;mi) from the oceans.&lt;ref name="PIA" /&gt; These points lie in a close triangle about the [[Dzungarian Gate]], a significant historical gateway to migration between the East and West.

Elsewhere in Xinjiang, the location {{coord|43|40|52|N|87|19|52|E}} in the southwestern suburbs of [[Ürümqi]] ([[Ürümqi County]]) was designated by local geography experts as the "center point of Asia" in 1992, and a [[Geographical Center of Asian Continent|monument to this effect]] was erected there in the 1990s. The site is a local tourist attraction.&lt;ref name="confluence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|title=43° 40' 52"N 87° 19' 52" E Geographic Center of Asia&amp;nbsp;– The Heart of Asia (亚洲之心)&amp;nbsp;– Xinjiang (新疆), China|last=|first=|date=22 June 2006|website=confluence.org|publisher=Confluence|accessdate=10 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602180943/http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|archivedate=2 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally, the continental and oceanic poles of inaccessibility have a similar radius; the Eurasian poles EPIA1 and EPIA2 are about {{convert|178|km|abbr=on}} closer to the ocean than the oceanic pole is to land.

'''Robert Wilkinson''' (fl. c. 1768 - 1825)&lt;ref name="geographicus"&gt;{{cite web|title=1794 Wilkinson Map of Europe|url=http://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/Europe-wilkinson-1794|website=Geographicus|publisher=Geographicus Rare Antique Maps|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[Cartography|map maker]] and atlas publisher.

==Career==
Most of Wilkinson's maps were derived from English map publisher John Bowles. Following Bowles' death in 1779, Wilkinson acquired the Bowles map plate library. After acquiring the map plate library, Wilkinson updated the plates until 1794 when he released ''The General Atlas of the World'' (1794, 1802, 1809). This atlas was reissued several times until Wilkinson's death in 1825.&lt;ref name="geographicus" /&gt;

Wilkinson's other works include ''Bowen and Kitchin's Large English Atlas'' (1785), ''Speer's West Indies'' (1796), ''Atlas Classica'' (1797), and independently issued maps of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] (1820) and [[North America]] (1823).&lt;ref name="geographicus" /&gt;

Wilkinson's offices were located at No.58, Cornhill, [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantsmap/hantsmap/kitchin2/kitchin2.htm|title=Kitchin's Hampshire 1751|publisher=Martin and Jean Norgate|accessdate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1792 - 1816, after which he relocated to 125 Frenchurch Street, also in London, until 1823.

After his death, Wilkinson's business and map plates were acquired by William Darton Jr, who reissued the General Atlas.&lt;ref name="geographicus" /&gt;

'''Saint Pierre Island''' is one of the three main islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]. It contains the town of [[Saint-Pierre, Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint-Pierre]], which lies on the island's east coast and is the main population centre of the island group.

Several smaller islands lie off the coast of Saint Pierre, notably [[L'Île-aux-Marins]] and [[L'Île-aux-Vainqueurs]], both to the east, and [[Grand Colombier]], which lies off Saint Pierre's northernmost point.  Saint Pierre and its neighboring islands form the [[Saint-Pierre, Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint-Pierre]] commune, one of two [[Communes of France|communes]] in Saint Pierre and Miquelon (the other being [[Miquelon-Langlade]]). The island is accessible by ferry from [[Newfoundland]] and has immigrations control for the country of [[France]].

'''Sediment transport''' is the movement of solid particles ([[sediment]]), typically due to a combination of gravity acting on the sediment, and/or the movement of the [[fluid]] in which the sediment is entrained. Sediment transport occurs in natural systems where the particles are [[clastic]] rocks ([[sand]], [[gravel]], [[boulders]], etc.), [[mud]], or [[clay]]; the fluid is air, water, or ice; and the force of gravity acts to move the particles along the sloping surface on which they  are resting. Sediment transport due to fluid motion occurs in [[river]]s, [[ocean]]s, [[lake]]s, [[sea]]s, and other bodies of water due to [[current (fluid)|currents]] and [[tide]]s. Transport is also caused by [[glacier]]s as they flow, and on terrestrial surfaces under the influence of [[wind]]. Sediment transport due only to gravity can occur on sloping surfaces in general, including [[hill]]slopes, [[escarpment|scarp]]s, [[cliff]]s, and the [[continental shelf]]—continental slope boundary.

Sediment transport is important in the fields of [[sedimentary geology]], [[geomorphology]], [[civil engineering]] and [[environmental engineering]] (see [[#Applications|applications]], below). Knowledge of sediment transport is most often used to determine whether [[erosion]] or [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] will occur, the magnitude of this erosion or deposition, and the time and distance over which it will occur.

==Mechanisms==

[[File:Congo river viewed from Kintambo 1.jpg|thumb|[[Congo river]] viewed from [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Its brownish color is mainly the result of the transported sediments taken upstream.]]

===Aeolian===
{{main|Aeolian processes}}
''Aeolian'' or ''eolian'' (depending on the parsing of [[æ]]) is the term for sediment transport by [[wind]]. This process results in the formation of [[Capillary wave|ripples]] and [[sand dunes]]. Typically, the size of the transported sediment is fine [[sand]] (&lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm) and smaller, because [[air]] is a fluid with low [[density]] and [[viscosity]], and can therefore not exert very much [[Shear strength|shear]] on its bed.

[[Bedform]]s are generated by aeolian sediment transport in the terrestrial near-surface environment. [[Ripple marks|Ripples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0012-8252(0)90029-U|title=Eolian ripples as examples of self-organization in geomorphological systems|year=1990|last1=Anderson|first1=R|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=29|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dune]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2005.05.005|title=Aeolian dune field self-organization – implications for the formation of simple versus complex dune-field patterns|year=2005|last1=Kocurek|first1=Gary|last2=Ewing|first2=Ryan C.|journal=Geomorphology|volume=72|page=94|bibcode = 2005Geomo..72...94K }}&lt;/ref&gt; form as a natural self-organizing response to sediment transport.

Aeolian sediment transport is common on beaches and in the arid regions of the world, because it is in these environments that vegetation does not prevent the presence and motion of fields of sand.

Wind-blown very fine-grained [[dust]] is capable of entering the upper atmosphere and moving across the globe. Dust from the [[Sahara]] deposits on the [[Canary Islands]] and islands in the [[Caribbean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(01)00067-8|title=Saharan dust storms: nature and consequences|year=2001|author=Goudie, A|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=56|page=179|bibcode=2001ESRv...56..179G|last2=Middleton|first2=N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dust from the [[Gobi desert]] has deposited on the [[western United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=6458&lt;/ref&gt; This sediment is important to the soil budget and ecology of several islands.

Deposits of fine-grained wind-blown [[glacier|glacial]] sediment are called [[loess]].

===Fluvial===
In [[geology]], [[physical geography]], and sediment transport, [[fluvial]] processes relate to flowing [[water]] in natural systems. This encompasses rivers, streams, [[periglacial]] flows, [[flash floods]] and [[glacial lake outburst flood]]s. Sediment moved by water can be larger than sediment moved by air because water has both a higher [[density]] and [[viscosity]]. In typical rivers the largest carried sediment is of [[sand]] and [[gravel]] size, but larger floods can carry [[cobbles]] and even [[boulders]].

Fluvial sediment transport can result in the formation of [[ripple marks|ripple]]s and [[dune]]s, in [[fractal]]-shaped patterns of erosion, in complex patterns of natural river systems, and in the development of [[floodplain]]s.

[[File:Laysan beach.jpg|thumb|left|Sand [[Ripple marks|ripples]], [[Laysan Beach]], [[Hawaii]]. Coastal '''sediment transport''' results in these evenly spaced ripples along the shore. [[Monk seal]] for scale.]]

===Coastal===
{{main|Coastal sediment transport}}
Coastal sediment transport takes place in near-shore environments due to the motions of waves and currents. At the mouths of rivers, coastal sediment and fluvial sediment transport processes mesh to create [[river delta]]s.

Coastal sediment transport results in the formation of characteristic coastal landforms such as [[beach]]es, [[barrier islands]], and capes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashton|first1=Andrew|last2=Murray|first2=A. Brad|last3=Arnault|first3=Olivier|journal=Nature|volume=414|pages=296–300|year=2001|doi=10.1038/35104541|issue=6861|pmid=11713526|title=Formation of coastline features by large-scale instabilities induced by high-angle waves|bibcode = 2001Natur.414..296A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|A [[glacier]] joining the [[Gorner Glacier]], [[Zermatt, Switzerland]]. These glaciers transport [[sediment]] and leave behind [[lateral moraines]].]]

===Glacial===
As glaciers move over their beds, they entrain and move material of all sizes. Glaciers can carry the largest sediment, and areas of glacial deposition often contain a large number of [[glacial erratics]], many of which are several metres in diameter. Glaciers also pulverize rock into "[[glacial flour]]", which is so fine that it is often carried away by winds to create [[loess]] deposits thousands of kilometres afield. Sediment entrained in glaciers often moves approximately along the glacial [[flowline]]s, causing it to appear at the surface in the [[ablation zone]].

===Hillslope===
In hillslope sediment transport, a variety of processes move [[regolith]] downslope. These include:
*[[Soil creep]]
*[[Tree throw]]
*Movement of  soil by burrowing animals
*Slumping and landsliding of the hillslope

These processes generally combine to give the hillslope a profile that looks like a solution to the [[diffusion equation]], where the diffusivity is a parameter that relates to the ease of sediment transport on the particular hillslope. For this reason, the tops of hills generally have a parabolic concave-up profile, which grades into a convex-up profile around valleys.

As hillslopes steepen, however, they become more prone to episodic [[landslide]]s and other [[mass wasting]] events. Therefore, hillslope processes are better described by a nonlinear diffusion equation in which classic diffusion dominates for shallow slopes and erosion rates go to infinity as the hillslope reaches a critical [[angle of repose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roering|first1=Joshua J.|last2=Kirchner|first2=James W.|last3=Dietrich|first3=William E.|title=Evidence for nonlinear, diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and implications for landscape morphology|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=35|page=853|year=1999|doi=10.1029/1998WR900090|bibcode=1999WRR....35..853R|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debris flow===

Large masses of material are moved in [[debris flow]]s, [[hyperconcentrated flow|hyperconcentrated]] mixtures of mud, clasts that range up to boulder-size, and water. Debris flows move as [[granular flow]]s down steep mountain valleys and washes. Because they transport sediment as a granular mixture, their transport mechanisms and capacities scale differently from those of fluvial systems.

==Applications==
[[File:IsfjordenSediment.JPG|thumb|Suspended sediment from a stream emptying into a fjord ([[Isfjord, Svalbard|Isfjorden]], Svalbard, Norway).]]

Sediment transport is applied to solve many environmental, geotechnical, and geological problems. Measuring or quantifying sediment transport or erosion is therefore important for [[coastal engineering]]. Several sediment erosion devices have been designed in order to quantitfy sediment erosion (e.g., Particle Erosion Simulator (PES)). One such device, also referred to as the BEAST (Benthic Environmental Assessment Sediment Tool) has been calibrated in order to quantify rates of sediment erosion.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, J., Walker, T.R., Hill P.S., Lintern, D.G. (2013) BEAST-A portable device for quantification of erosion in intact sediment cores. Methods in Oceanography. DOI: 10.1016/j.mio.2013.03.001&lt;/ref&gt;

Movement of sediment is important in providing habitat for fish and other organisms in rivers. Therefore, managers of highly regulated rivers, which are often sediment-starved due to dams, are often advised to stage short floods to refresh the bed material and rebuild bars. This is also important, for example, in the [[Grand Canyon]] of the [[Colorado River]], to rebuild shoreline habitats also used as campsites.

Sediment discharge into a reservoir formed by a dam forms a reservoir [[River delta|delta]]. This delta will fill the basin, and eventually, either the reservoir will need to be dredged or the dam will need to be removed. Knowledge of sediment transport can be used to properly plan to extend the life of a dam.

Geologists can use inverse solutions of transport relationships to understand flow depth, velocity, and direction, from sedimentary rocks and young deposits of alluvial materials.

Flow in culverts, over dams, and around bridge piers can cause erosion of the bed. This erosion can damage the environment and expose or unsettle the foundations of the structure. Therefore, good knowledge of the mechanics of sediment transport in a built environment are important for civil and hydraulic engineers.

When suspended sediment transport is increased due to human activities, causing environmental problems including the filling of channels, it is called [[siltation]] after the grain-size fraction dominating the process.

==Initiation of motion==
{{howto|date=February 2016}}

===Stress balance===

For a fluid to begin transporting sediment that is currently at rest on a surface, the boundary (or bed) [[shear stress]] &lt;math&gt;\tau_b&lt;/math&gt; exerted by the fluid must exceed the critical shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; for the initiation of motion of grains at the bed. This basic criterion for the initiation of motion can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\tau_c&lt;/math&gt;.

This is typically represented by a comparison between a [[dimensionless]] shear stress (&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*&lt;/math&gt;)and a dimensionless critical shear stress (&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;). The nondimensionalization is in order to compare the driving forces of particle motion (shear stress) to the resisting forces that would make it stationary (particle density and size). This dimensionless shear stress, &lt;math&gt;\tau*&lt;/math&gt;, is called the [[Shields parameter]] and is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Shields, A. (1936) Anwendung der Ähnlichkeitsmechanik und der Turbulenzforschung auf die Geschiebebewegung; In Mitteilungen der Preussischen Versuchsanstalt für Wasserbau und Schiffbau, Heft 26 ([http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:61a19716-a994-4942-9906-f680eb9952d6/Shields.pdf Online]; PDF; 3,8&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau*=\frac{\tau}{(\rho_s-\rho_f)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

And the new equation to solve becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

The equations included here describe sediment transport for [[clastic]], or [[granular]] sediment. They do not work for [[clays]] and [[muds]] because these types of [[Flocculation|floccular]] sediments do not fit the geometric simplifications in these equations, and also interact thorough [[electrostatic]] forces. The equations were also designed for [[fluvial]] sediment transport of particles carried along in a liquid flow, such as that in a river, canal, or other open channel.

Only one size of particle is considered in this equation. However, river beds are often formed by a mixture of sediment of various sizes. In case of partial motion where only a part of the sediment mixture moves, the river bed becomes enriched in large gravel as the smaller sediments are washed away. The smaller sediments present under this layer of large gravel have a lower possibility of movement and total sediment transport decreases. This is called armouring effect.&lt;ref&gt;Saniya Sharmeen and Garry R. Willgoose1, 
The interaction between armouring and particle weathering for eroding landscapes, ''[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]'' 31, 1195–1210 (2006)

&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of armouring of sediment or decreasing rates of sediment erosion can be caused by carpets of microbial mats, under conditions of high organic loading.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T.R., Grant, J. (2009) Quantifying erosion rates and stability of bottom sediments at mussel aquaculture sites in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Journal of Marine Systems. 75: 46-55. doi:10.1016/j.jmarsys.2008.07.009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical shear stress===

[[File:Shields diagram.jpg|thumb|300px|Original Shields diagram, 1936]]
The Shields{{fix|Diagram, citation}} diagram empirically shows how the dimensionless critical shear stress (i.e. the dimensionless shear stress required for the initiation of motion) is a function of a particular form of the particle [[Reynolds number]], &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p&lt;/math&gt; or Reynolds number related to the particle. This allows us to rewrite the criterion for the initiation of motion in terms of only needing to solve for a specific version of the particle Reynolds number, which we call &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p*&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=f\left(\mathrm{Re}_p*\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can then be solved by using the empirically derived Shields curve to find &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt; as a function of a specific form of the particle Reynolds number called the boundary Reynolds number. The mathematical solution of the equation was given by [[Subhasish Dey|Dey]].&lt;ref&gt;Dey S. (1999) Sediment threshold. ''Applied Mathematical Modelling'', Elsevier, Vol. 23, No. 5, 399-417.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Particle Reynolds Number===

In general, a particle Reynolds Number has the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p=\frac{U_p D}{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;U_p&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic particle velocity, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the grain diameter (a characteristic particle size), and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the kinematic viscosity, which is given by the dynamic viscosity, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, divided by the fluid density, &lt;math&gt;{\rho_f}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{\mu}{\rho_f}&lt;/math&gt;

The specific particle Reynolds number of interest is called the boundary Reynolds number, and it is formed by replacing the velocity term in the Particle Reynolds number by the [[shear velocity]], &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt;, which is a way of rewriting shear stress in terms of velocity.

:&lt;math&gt;u_*=\sqrt{\frac{\tau_b}{\rho_f}}=\kappa z \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau_b&lt;/math&gt; is the bed shear stress (described below), and &lt;math&gt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt; is the [[von Kármán constant]], where

:&lt;math&gt; \kappa = {0.407}&lt;/math&gt;.

The particle Reynolds number is therefore given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p*=\frac{u_* D}{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

===Bed shear stress===

The boundary Reynolds number can be used with the Shields diagram to empirically solve the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=f\left(\mathrm{Re}_p*\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

which solves the right-hand side of the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to solve the left-hand side, expanded as

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\frac{\tau_b}{(\rho_s-\rho_f)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;,

we must find the bed shear stress, &lt;math&gt;{\tau_b}&lt;/math&gt;. There are several ways to solve for the bed shear stress. First, we develop the simplest approach, in which the flow is assumed to be steady and uniform and reach-averaged depth and slope are used. Due to the difficulty of measuring shear stress ''in situ'', this method is also one of the most-commonly used. This method is known as the [[depth-slope product]].

====Depth-slope product====
{{main|Depth-slope product}}

For a river undergoing approximately steady, uniform equilibrium flow, of approximately constant depth ''h'' and slope angle θ over the reach of interest, and whose width is much greater than its depth, the bed shear stress is given by some momentum considerations stating that the gravity force component in the flow direction equals exactly the friction force.&lt;ref name="Chanson"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson]] |title= The Hydraulics of Open Channel Flow: An Introduction |publisher= Butterworth-Heinemann, 2nd edition, Oxford, UK, 630 pages |year=2004  |isbn=978-0-7506-5978-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a wide channel, it yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho g h \sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

For shallow slope angles, which are found in almost all natural lowland streams, the [[small-angle formula]] shows that &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, which is given by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the slope. Rewritten with this:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho g h S&lt;/math&gt;

====Shear velocity, velocity, and friction factor====

For the steady case, by extrapolating the depth-slope product and the equation for shear velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho g h S&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u_*=\sqrt{\left(\frac{\tau_b}{\rho}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;,

We can see that the depth-slope product can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho u_*^2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;u*&lt;/math&gt; is related to the mean flow velocity, &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;, through the generalized [[Darcy-Weisbach friction factor]], &lt;math&gt;C_f&lt;/math&gt;, which is equal to the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor divided by 8 (for mathematical convenience).&lt;ref name="whipple roughness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-163-surface-processes-and-landscape-evolution-fall-2004/labs/roughnes_handout.pdf|title=Hydraulic Roughness|last=Whipple|first=Kelin|year=2004|work=12.163: Surface processes and landscape evolution|publisher=MIT OCW|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inserting this friction factor,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho C_f \left(\bar{u} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

====Unsteady flow====
For all flows that cannot be simplified as a single-slope infinite channel (as in the [[depth-slope product]], above), the bed shear stress can be locally found by applying the [[Shallow water equations|Saint-Venant equations]] for [[continuity equation|continuity]], which consider accelerations within the flow.

===Example===

====Set-up====

The criterion for the initiation of motion, established earlier, states that

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

In this equation,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau*=\frac{\tau}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\tau_b}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}=\frac{\tau_{c}}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt; is a function of boundary Reynolds number, a specific type of particle Reynolds number.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=f \left(Re_p* \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a particular particle Reynolds number, &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt; will be an emprical constant given by the Shields Curve or by another set of empirical data (depending on whether or not the grain size is uniform).

Therefore, the final equation that we seek to solve is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\tau_b}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}=f \left(Re_p* \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Solution====

We make several assumptions to provide an example that will allow us to bring the above form of the equation into a solved form.

First, we assume that the a good approximation of reach-averaged shear stress is given by the depth-slope product. We can then rewrite the equation as

:&lt;math&gt;{\rho g h S}=0.06{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Moving and re-combining the terms, we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}={\frac{(\rho_s-\rho)}{\rho}(D)}\left(f \left(\mathrm{Re}_p* \right) \right)=R D \left(f \left(\mathrm{Re}_p* \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where R is the [[submerged specific gravity]] of the sediment.

We then make our second assumption, which is that the particle Reynolds number is high. This is typically applicable to particles of gravel-size or larger in a stream, and means that the critical shear stress is a constant. The Shields curve shows that for a bed with a uniform grain size,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.06&lt;/math&gt;.

Later researchers{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} have shown that this value is closer to

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.03&lt;/math&gt;

for more uniformly sorted beds. Therefore, we will simply insert

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=f \left(\mathrm{Re}_p* \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and insert both values at the end.

The equation now reads:

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}=R D \tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;

This final expression shows that the product of the channel depth and slope is equal to the Shield's criterion times the submerged specific gravity of the particles times the particle diameter.

For a typical situation, such as quartz-rich sediment &lt;math&gt;\left(\rho_s=2650 \frac{kg}{m^3} \right)&lt;/math&gt; in water &lt;math&gt;\left(\rho=1000 \frac{kg}{m^3} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, the submerged specific gravity is equal to 1.65.

:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{(\rho_s-\rho)}{\rho}=1.65&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the equation above,

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}=1.65(D)\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

For the Shield's criterion of &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.06&lt;/math&gt;. 0.06 * 1.65 = 0.099, which is well within standard margins of error of 0.1. Therefore, for a uniform bed,

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}={0.1(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

For these situations, the product of the depth and slope of the flow should be 10% of the diameter of the median grain diameter.

The mixed-grain-size bed value is &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.03&lt;/math&gt;, which is supported by more recent research as being more broadly applicable because most natural streams have mixed grain sizes. Using this value, and changing D to D_50 ("50" for the 50th percentile, or the median grain size, as we are now looking at a mixed-grain-size bed), the equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}={0.05(D_{50})}&lt;/math&gt;

Which means that the depth times the slope should be about 5% of the median grain diameter in the case of a mixed-grain-size bed.

==Modes of entrainment==

The sediments entrained in a flow can be transported along the bed as [[bed load]] in the form of sliding and rolling grains, or in suspension as [[suspended load]] advected by the main flow.&lt;ref name="Chanson" /&gt; Some sediment materials may also come from the upstream reaches and be carried downstream in the form of [[wash load]].

===Rouse number===

The location in the flow in which a particle is entrained is determined by the [[Rouse number]], which is determined by the density ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and diameter ''d'' of the sediment particle, and the density ''ρ'' and kinematic viscosity ''ν'' of the fluid, determine in which part of the flow the sediment particle will be carried.&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-163-surface-processes-and-landscape-evolution-fall-2004/lecture-notes/4_sediment_transport_edited.pdf|title=IV.

:&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{w_s}{\kappa u_\ast}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the Rouse number is given by ''P''. The term in the numerator is the (downwards) sediment the sediment [[Terminal velocity|settling velocity]] ''w''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, which is discussed below. The upwards velocity on the grain is given as a product of the [[von Kármán constant]], ''κ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.4, and the [[shear velocity]], ''u''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;.

The following table gives the approximate required Rouse numbers for transport as [[bed load]], [[suspended load]], and [[wash load]].&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore_loose_ends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_20.pdf|title=Lecture 20—Some Loose Ends|last=Moore|first=Andrew|work=Lecture Notes: Fluvial Sediment Transport|location=Kent State|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settling velocity===
[[File:Stokes sphere.svg|thumb|Streamlines around a sphere falling through a fluid. This illustration is accurate for [[laminar flow]], in which the particle [[Reynolds number]] is small. This is typical for small particles falling through a viscous fluid; larger particles would result in the creation of a [[turbulence|turbulent]] wake.]]

The settling velocity (also called the "fall velocity" or "[[terminal velocity]]") is a function of the particle [[Reynolds number]]. Generally, for small particles (laminar approximation), it can be calculated with [[Stokes' Law]]. For larger particles (turbulent particle Reynolds numbers), fall velocity is calculated with the turbulent [[Drag (physics)|drag]] law. [[William E. Dietrich|Dietrich]] (1982) compiled a large amount of published data to which he empirically fit settling velocity curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dietrich|first=W. E.|year=1982|title=Settling Velocity of Natural Particles|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1615–1626|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~jvenditt/geog413_613/readings/1982_Dietrich_settling_velocity.pdf|doi=10.1029/WR018i006p01615|bibcode=1982WRR....18.1615D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson and Church (2006) analytically combined the expressions for Stokes flow and a turbulent drag law into a single equation that works for all sizes of sediment, and successfully tested it against the data of Dietrich.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, R. I., and M. Church (2006), A Simple Universal Equation for Grain Settling Velocity, Journal of Sedimentary Research, 74(6) 933-937, {{doi|10.1306/051204740933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their equation is

:&lt;math&gt;w_s=\frac{RgD^2}{C_1 \nu + (0.75 C_2 R g D^3)^{(0.5)}}&lt;/math&gt;.

In this equation ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sediment settling velocity, ''g'' is acceleration due to gravity, and ''D'' is mean sediment diameter. &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[kinematic viscosity]] of [[water]], which is approximately 1.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s for water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C.

&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are constants related to the shape and smoothness of the grains.

The expression for fall velocity can be simplified so that it can be solved only in terms of ''D''. We use the sieve diameters for natural grains, &lt;math&gt;g=9.8&lt;/math&gt;, and values given above for &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. From these parameters, the fall velocity is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;w_s=\frac{16.17D^2}{1.8\cdot10^{-5} + (12.1275D^3)^{(0.5)}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Hjulström-Sundborg Diagram==
[[File:Hjulströms diagram en.PNG|thumb|300px|The [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] Hjulström curve]]
In 1935, [[Filip Hjulström]] created the [[Hjulström curve]], a graph which shows the relationship between the size of sediment and the velocity required to erode (lift it), transport it, or deposit it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/A-level/AQA/Year%2012/Rivers,%20Floods/Long%20profile/Hjulstrom.htm The long profile – changing processes: types of erosion, transportation and deposition, types of load; the Hjulstrom curve]. coolgeography.co.uk. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The graph is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]].

[[Åke Sundborg]] later modified the Hjulström curve to show separate curves for the movement threshold corresponding to several water depths, as is necessary if the flow velocity rather than the boundary shear stress (as in the Shields diagram) is used for the flow strength.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-090-special-topics-an-introduction-to-fluid-motions-sediment-transport-and-current-generated-sedimentary-structures-fall-2006/lecture-notes/ch9.pdf Special Topics: An Introduction to Fluid Motions, Sediment Transport, and Current-generated Sedimentary Structures; As taught in: Fall 2006]. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. 2006. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

This curve has no more than a historical value nowadays, although its simplicity is still attractive. Among the drawbacks of this curve are that it does not take the water depth into account and more importantly, that it does not show that sedimentation is caused by flow velocity ''deceleration'' and erosion is caused by flow ''acceleration''. The dimensionless Shields diagram is now unanimously accepted for initiation of sediment motion in rivers.

==Transport rate==
[[File:Stream Load.gif|thumb|500px|right|A schematic diagram of where the different types of sediment load are carried in the flow. [[Dissolved load]] is not sediment: it is composed of disassociated [[ion]]s moving along with the flow. It may, however, constitute a significant proportion (often several percent, but occasionally greater than half) of the total amount of material being transported by the stream.]]

Formulas to calculate sediment transport rate exist for sediment moving in several different parts of the flow. These formulas are often segregated into [[bed load]], [[suspended load]], and [[wash load]]. They may sometimes also be segregated into [[bed material load]] and wash load.

===Bed Load===
Bed load moves by rolling, sliding, and hopping (or [[saltation (geology)|saltating]]) over the bed, and moves at a small fraction of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the [[bed material load]] (the bed load plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed. As the bed load is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.

Bed load transport rates are usually expressed as being related to excess dimensionless shear stress raised to some power. Excess dimensionless shear stress is a nondimensional measure of bed shear stress about the threshold for motion.

:&lt;math&gt;(\tau^*_b-\tau^*_c)&lt;/math&gt;,

Bed load transport rates may also be given by a ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress, which is equivalent in both the dimensional and nondimensional cases. This ratio is called the "transport stage" &lt;math&gt;(T_s \text{ or } \phi)&lt;/math&gt; and is an important in that it shows bed shear stress as a multiple of the value of the criterion for the initiation of motion.

:&lt;math&gt;T_s=\phi=\frac{\tau_b}{\tau_c}&lt;/math&gt;

When used for sediment transport formulae, this ratio is typically raised to a power.

The majority of the published relations for bedload transport are given in dry sediment weight per unit channel width, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; ("[[breadth]]"):

:&lt;math&gt;q_s=\frac{Q_s}{b}&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to the difficulty of estimating bed load transport rates, these equations are typically only suitable for the situations for which they were designed.

====Notable bed load transport formulae====

=====Meyer-Peter Müller and derivatives=====

The transport formula of Meyer-Peter and Müller, originally developed in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer-Peter|first=E|author2=Müller, R.|title=Formulas for bed-load transport|year=1948|series=Proceedings of the 2nd Meeting of the International Association for Hydraulic Structures Research|pages=39–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; was designed for well-[[sorting (sediment)|sorted]] [[particle size (grain size)|fine]] [[gravel]] at a transport stage of about 8.&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt; The formula uses the above nondimensionalization for shear stress,&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau*=\frac{\tau}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;,

and [[Hans Albert Einstein|Hans Einstein's]] nondimensionalization for sediment volumetric discharge per unit width&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;q_s* = \frac{q_s}{D \sqrt{\frac{\rho_s-\rho}{\rho} g D}} = \frac{q_s}{Re_p \nu}&lt;/math&gt;.

Their formula reads:

:&lt;math&gt;q_s* = 8\left(\tau*-\tau*_c \right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;

Their experimentally determined value for &lt;math&gt;\tau*_c&lt;/math&gt; is 0.047, and is the third commonly used value for this (in addition to Parker's 0.03 and Shields' 0.06).

Because of its broad use, some revisions to the formula have taken place over the years that show that the coefficient on the left ("8" above) is a function of the transport stage:&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="f-l"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez-Luque|first=R|author2=van Beek, R|year=1976|title=Erosion and transport of bedload sediment|journal=Jour.

The variations in the coefficient were later generalized as a function of dimensionless shear stress:&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wiberg_smith"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1989)115:1(101)|title=Model for Calculating Bed Load Transport of Sediment|year=1989|last1=Wiberg|first1=Patricia L.|first2=J.|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|volume=115|page=101|last2=Dungan Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} q_s* = \alpha_s \left(\tau*-\tau_c* \right)^n \\ n = \frac{3}{2} \\ \alpha_s = 1.6 \ln\left(\tau*\right) + 9.8 \approx 9.64 \tau*^{0.166} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="wiberg_smith" /&gt;

=====Wilcock and Crowe=====

In 2003, [[Peter Wilcock (scientist)|Peter Wilcock]] and Joanna Crowe (now Joanna Curran) published a sediment transport formula that works with multiple grain sizes across the sand and gravel range.&lt;ref name=wilcock_crowe&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2003)129:2(120)|title=Surface-based Transport Model for Mixed-Size Sediment|year=2003|last1=Wilcock|first1=Peter R.|last2=Crowe|first2=Joanna C.|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|volume=129|page=120|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their formula works with surface grain size distributions, as opposed to older models which use subsurface grain size distributions (and thereby implicitly infer a surface grain [[sorting (sediment)|sorting]]).

Their expression is more complicated than the basic sediment transport rules (such as that of Meyer-Peter and Müller) because it takes into account multiple grain sizes: this requires consideration of reference shear stresses for each grain size, the fraction of the total sediment supply that falls into each grain size class, and a "hiding function".

The "hiding function" takes into account the fact that, while small grains are inherently more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause "equal mobility", in which small grains can move just as easily as large ones.&lt;ref name="parker_etal_1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=G.|author2=Klingeman, P. C. |author3=McLean, D. G. |year=1982|title=Bedload and Size Distribution in Paved Gravel-Bed Streams|journal=Journal of the Hydraulics Division|publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]]|volume=108|issue=4|pages=544–571|url=http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?8200331}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the "equal mobility" portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.&lt;ref name=wilcock_crowe /&gt;

Their model is based on the transport stage, or ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress for the initiation of grain motion. Because their formula works with several grain sizes simultaneously, they define the critical shear stress for each grain size class, &lt;math&gt;\tau_{c,D_i}&lt;/math&gt;, to be equal to a "reference shear stress", &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ri}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=wilcock_crowe/&gt;

They express their equations in terms of a dimensionless transport parameter, &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; (with the "&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;" indicating nondimensionality and the "&lt;math&gt;_i&lt;/math&gt;" indicating that it is a function of grain size):

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = \frac{R g q_{bi}}{F_i u*^3}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{bi}&lt;/math&gt; is the volumetric bed load transport rate of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; per unit channel width &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that is present on the bed.

They came up with two equations, depending on the transport stage, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt; 1.35&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = 0.002 \phi^{7.5}&lt;/math&gt;

and for &lt;math&gt;\phi \geq 1.35&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = 14 \left(1 - \frac{0.894}{\phi^{0.5}}\right)^{4.5}&lt;/math&gt;.

This equation asymptotically reaches a constant value of &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; becomes large.

=====Wilcock and Kenworthy =====

In 2002, [[Peter Wilcock (scientist)|Peter Wilcock]] and Kenworthy T.A. , following Peter Wilcock (1998),&lt;ref name=Wilcock_Science&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1126/science.280.5362.410|last1=Wilcock|first1=P. R.|title=Two-fraction model of initial sediment motion in gravel-bed rivers|journal=Science|date=1998|issue=280|pages=410–412|bibcode = 1998Sci...280..410W }}&lt;/ref&gt; published a sediment bed-load transport formula that works with only  two sediments fractions, i.e. sand and gravel fractions.&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2001WR000684|title=A two-fraction model for the transport of sand/gravel mixtures|year=2002|last1=Wilcock|first1=Peter R.|last2=Kenworthy|first2=T.|journal=Water Resour. Res.|volume=38|page=1194|issue=10|bibcode = 2002WRR....38.1194W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Wilcock and Kenworthy T.A. in their article recognized  that a mixed-sized sediment bed-load transport model using only two fractions offers practical advantages in terms of both computational and conceptual modeling by taking into account the nonlinear effects of sand presence in gravel beds on bed-load transport rate of both fractions. In fact, in the two-fraction bed load formula appears a new ingredient with respect to that of Meyer-Peter and Müller that is the proportion &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; of fraction &lt;math&gt;i &lt;/math&gt; on the bed surface where  the subscript &lt;math&gt;_i &lt;/math&gt; represents either the sand (s) or gravel (g) fraction. The proportion &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of  sand content &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt;, physically represents the relative influence of the mechanisms controlling sand and gravel transport, associated with the change from a clast-supported to matrix-supported gravel bed. Moreover, since &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; spans between 0 and 1, phenomena that vary with &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; include the relative size effects producing ‘‘hiding’’ of fine grains and ‘‘exposure’’ of coarse grains.
The ‘‘hiding’’ effect takes into account the fact that, while small grains are inherently more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size, which the Meyer-Peter and Müller formula refers to. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause ‘‘equal mobility", in which small grains can move just as easily as large ones.&lt;ref name="parker_etal_1982"/&gt; As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the ‘‘equal mobility’’ portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy /&gt;

Their model is based on the transport stage,''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, or ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress for the initiation of grain motion. Because their formula works with only two fractions simultaneously, they define the critical shear stress for each of the two grain size classes, &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ri}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;_i &lt;/math&gt; represents either the sand (s) or gravel (g) fraction . The critical shear stress that represents the incipient motion for each of the two fractions is consistent with established values in the limit of pure sand and gravel beds and shows a sharp change with increasing sand content over the transition from a clast- to matrix-supported bed.&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy/&gt;

They express their equations in terms of a dimensionless transport parameter, &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; (with the "&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;" indicating nondimensionality and the ‘‘&lt;math&gt;_i&lt;/math&gt;’’ indicating that it is a function of grain size):

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = \frac{R g q_{bi}}{F_i u*^3}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{bi}&lt;/math&gt; is the volumetric bed load transport rate of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; per unit channel width &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that is present on the bed.

They came up with two equations, depending on the transport stage, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt; \phi^'&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = 0.002 \phi^{7.5}&lt;/math&gt;

and for &lt;math&gt;\phi \geq \phi^'&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = A \left(1 - \frac{\chi}{\phi^{0.5}}\right)^{4.5}&lt;/math&gt;.

This equation asymptotically reaches a constant value of &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; becomes large and the symbols &lt;math&gt;A,\phi^',\chi&lt;/math&gt; have the following values:
:&lt;math&gt;A = 70 ,\phi^'=1.19 ,\chi=0.908, \text{laboratory}&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;A = 115, \phi^'=1.27 ,\chi=0.923, \text{field}&lt;/math&gt;
In order to apply the above formulation, it is necessary to specify the characteristic grain sizes &lt;math&gt;D_s&lt;/math&gt; for the sand portion and &lt;math&gt;D_g&lt;/math&gt; for the gravel portion of the surface layer, the fractions &lt;math&gt; F_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; F_g&lt;/math&gt; of sand and gravel, respectively in the surface layer, the submerged specific gravity of the sediment R and shear velocity associated with skin friction &lt;math&gt; u_*&lt;/math&gt; .

===== Kuhnle ''et al.''=====
For the case in which sand fraction is transported by the current over and through an immobile gravel bed, Kuhnle ''et al.''(2013),&lt;ref name=Kuhnle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhnle|first1=R. A.|last2=Wren|first2=D. G.|last3=Langendoen|first3=E. J.|last4=Rigby|first4=J. R.|title=Sand Transport over an Immobile Gravel Substrate|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|date=2013|volume=139|issue=2|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000615}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the theoretical analysis done by Pellachini (2011),&lt;ref name=Pellachini&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pellachini|first1=Corrado|title=Modelling fine sediment transport over an immobile gravel bed|date=2011|publisher=Unitn-eprints|location=Trento|url=http://eprints-phd.biblio.unitn.it/605/}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a new relationship for the bed load transport of the sand fraction when gravel particles remain at rest. It is worth mentioning that Kuhnle ''et al.'' (2013)&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt; applied the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002)&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy /&gt; formula to their experimental data and found out that predicted bed load rates of sand fraction were about 10 times greater than measured and approached 1 as the sand elevation became near the top of the gravel layer.&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt; They, also, hypothesized that the mismatch between predicted and measured sand bed load rates is due to the fact that the bed shear stress used for the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002)&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy /&gt; formula  was larger than that available for transport within the gravel bed because of the sheltering effect of the gravel particles.&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt;
To overcome this mismatch, following Pellachini (2011),&lt;ref name=Pellachini/&gt; they assumed that the variability of the bed shear stress available for the sand to be transported by the current would be some function of the so-called "Roughness Geometry Function" (RGF),&lt;ref name=Nikora&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikora|first1=V|last2=Goring|first2=D|last3=McEwan|first3=I|last4=Griffiths|first4=G|title=Spatially averaged open-channel flow over rough bed|journal=J. Hydraul. Eng.|date=2001|volume=127|issue=2|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2001)127:2(123)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents the  gravel bed elevations distribution. Therefore, the sand bed load formula follows as:&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q^*_s = 2.29*10^{-5} A(z_s)^{2.14}\left(\frac{\tau_b}{\tau_{cs} } \right)^{3.49}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;q^*_s = \frac{q_s}{[(s-1)gD_s]^{0.5}\rho_sD_s}&lt;/math&gt;
the subscript &lt;math&gt;_s&lt;/math&gt; refers to the sand fraction, s represents the ratio &lt;math&gt;\rho_s/\rho_w&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is the sand fraction density, &lt;math&gt; A(z_s)&lt;/math&gt; is the RGF as a function of the sand level &lt;math&gt; z_s&lt;/math&gt; within the gravel bed,  &lt;math&gt; \tau_b&lt;/math&gt; is the bed shear stress available for sand transport and &lt;math&gt; \tau_{cs}&lt;/math&gt; is the critical shear stress for incipient motion of the sand fraction, which was calculated graphically using the updated Shields-type relation of Miller ''et al.''(1977)&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=M.C.|last2=McCave|first2=I.N.|last3=Komar|first3=P.D.|title=Threshold of sediment motion under unidirectional currents.|journal=Sedimentology|date=1977|volume=24|issue=4|pages=507–527|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1977.tb00136.x|bibcode = 1977Sedim..24..507M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspended load===
{{Main|suspended load}}
Suspended load is carried in the lower to middle parts of the flow, and moves at a large fraction of the mean flow velocity in the stream.

A common characterization of suspended sediment concentration in a flow is given by the Rouse Profile. This characterization works for the situation in which sediment concentration &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; at one particular elevation above the bed &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; can be quantified. It is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c_s}{c_0} = \left[\frac{z \left(h-z_0\right)}{z_0\left(h-z\right)}\right]^{-P/\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the elevation above the bed, &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of suspended sediment at that elevation, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the flow depth, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the Rouse number, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; relates the eddy viscosity for momentum &lt;math&gt;K_m&lt;/math&gt; to the eddy diffusivity for sediment, which is approximately equal to one.&lt;ref name="harris_sus_sed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vims.edu/~ckharris/MS698_03/lecture_09.pdf|title=Lecture 9: Suspended Sediment Transport II|last=Harris|first=Courtney K.|date=March 18, 2003|work=Sediment transport processes in coastal environments|accessdate=23 December 2009|location=[[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528054103/http://www.vims.edu/~ckharris/MS698_03/lecture_09.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{K_s}{K_m} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;

Experimental work has shown that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ranges from 0.93 to 1.10 for sands and silts.&lt;ref name="moore_sus_sed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_21.pdf|title=Lecture 21—Suspended Sediment Transport|last=Moore|first=Andrew|work=Lecture Notes: Fluvial Sediment Transport|accessdate=25 December 2009|location=Kent State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rouse profile characterizes sediment concentrations because the Rouse number includes both turbulent mixing and settling under the weight of the particles. Turbulent mixing results in the net motion of particles from regions of high concentrations to low concentrations. Because particles settle downward, for all cases where the particles are not neutrally buoyant or sufficiently light that this settling velocity is negligible, there is a net negative concentration gradient as one goes upward in the flow. The Rouse Profile therefore gives the concentration profile that provides a balance between turbulent mixing (net upwards) of sediment and the downwards settling velocity of each particle.

===Bed material load===
Bed material load comprises the bed load and the portion of the suspended load that is sourced from the bed.

Three common bed material transport relations are the "Ackers-White",&lt;ref name="ackers-white"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackers|first=P.|author2=White, W.R. |year=1973|title=Sediment Transport: New Approach and Analysis|journal=[[Journal of the Hydraulics Division]]|publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]]|volume=99|issue=11|pages=2041–2060|url=http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?7300122}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Engelund-Hansen", "Yang" formulae. The first is for [[sand]] to [[Granule (geology)|granule]]-size gravel, and the second and third are for sand&lt;ref name="bm_eval"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ariffin|first=J. |author2=A.A. Ghani |author3=N.A. Zakaira |author4=A.H. Yahya|date=14–16 October 2002|title=Evaluation of equations on total bed material load|journal=International Conference on Urban Hydrology for the 21st Century|location=[[Kuala Lumpur]]|url=http://redac.eng.usm.my/html/publish/2002_07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Yang later expanded his formula to include fine gravel. That all of these formulae cover the sand-size range and two of them are exclusively for sand is that the sediment in sand-bed rivers is commonly moved simultaneously as bed and suspended load.

====Engelund-Hansen====

The bed material load formula of Engelund and Hansen is the only one to not include some kind of critical value for the initiation of sediment transport. It reads:

:&lt;math&gt;q_s* = \frac{0.05}{c_f} \tau*^{2.5} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q_s*&lt;/math&gt; is the Einstein nondimensionalization for sediment volumetric discharge per unit width, &lt;math&gt;c_f&lt;/math&gt; is a friction factor, and &lt;math&gt;\tau*&lt;/math&gt; is the Shields stress. The Engelund-Hansen formula is one of the few sediment transport formulae in which a threshold "critical shear stress" is absent.

===Wash load===
Wash load is carried within the water column as part of the flow, and therefore moves with the mean velocity of main stream. Wash load concentrations are approximately uniform in the water column. This is described by the endmember case in which the Rouse number is equal to 0 (i.e. the settling velocity is far less than the turbulent mixing velocity), which leads to a prediction of a perfectly uniform vertical concentration profile of material.

===Total load===
Some authors have attempted formulations for the total sediment load carried in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=C|title=Unit stream power equations for total load|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=40|page=123|year=1979|doi=10.1016/0022-1694(79)90092-1|bibcode = 1979JHyd...40..123Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailard|first1=James A.|title=An Energetics Total Load Sediment Transport Model For a Plane Sloping Beach|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=86|page=10938|year=1981|doi=10.1029/JC086iC11p10938|bibcode=1981JGR....8610938B}}&lt;/ref&gt; These formulas are designed largely for sand, as (depending on flow conditions) sand often can be carried as both bed load and suspended load in the same stream or shoreface.

A '''snow field''', '''snowfield ''' or '''neve''' is an accumulation of [[permanent snow]] and ice, typically found above the [[snow line]], normally in [[mountain|mountainous]] and [[glacier|glacial]] terrain.

[[Glacier#Formation|Glaciers]] originate in snowfields. The lower end of a glacier is usually free from snow and [[névé]] in summer. In the upper end and above the upper boundary of a glacier, the snow field is an [[ice field]] covered with snow. The glacier upper boundary, where it emerges from under a snow field, is ill-defined because of gradual transition.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin, Rollin D. Salisbury (1904) "Geology", [https://books.google.com/books?id=p0QNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=%22snow+field+is%22 p. 258] &lt;!-- a more modern reference would be preferred here --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''Strahler number''' or '''Horton–Strahler number''' of a mathematical [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] is a numerical measure of its branching complexity.

These numbers were first developed in [[hydrology]] by {{harvs|first=Robert E.|last=Horton|authorlink=Robert E. Horton|year=1945|txt}} and {{harvs|first=Arthur Newell|last=Strahler|authorlink=Arthur Newell Strahler|year=1952|year2=1957|txt}}; in this application, they are referred to as the '''Strahler stream order''' and are used to define stream size based on a hierarchy of [[tributary|tributaries]]. They also arise in the analysis of [[L-system]]s and of hierarchical biological structures such as (biological) trees and animal respiratory and circulatory systems, in [[register allocation]] for [[compiler|compilation]] of [[high-level programming language]]s and in the analysis of [[social network]]s. Alternative [[stream order|stream ordering systems]] have been developed by Shreve&lt;ref&gt;Shreve, R.L., 1966. Statistical law of stream numbers. Journal of Geology 74, 17–37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shreve, R.L., 1967. Infinite topologically random channel networks. Journal of Geology 75, 178–186.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hodgkinson et al.&lt;ref name="Hodgkinson, J.H. 2006"&gt;Hodgkinson, J.H., McLoughlin, S. &amp; Cox, M.E. 2006. The influence of structural grain on drainage in a metamorphic sub-catchment: Laceys Creek, southeast Queensland, Australia. Geomorphology, 81: 394–407.&lt;/ref&gt; A statistical comparison of Strahler and Shreve systems, together with an analysis of stream/link lengths, is given by Smart.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.S. 1968, Statistical properties of stream lengths, Water Resources Research, 4, No 5. 1001–1014 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
All trees in this context are [[directed graph]]s, oriented from the root towards the leaves; in other words, they are [[Arborescence (graph theory)|arborescences]]. The [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of a node in a tree is just its number of children. One may assign a Strahler number to all nodes of a tree, in bottom-up order, as follows:
*If the node is a leaf (has no children), its Strahler number is one.
*If the node has one child with Strahler number ''i'', and all other children have Strahler numbers less than ''i'', then the Strahler number of the node is ''i'' again.
*If the node has two or more children with Strahler number ''i'', and no children with greater number, then the Strahler number of the node is ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.
The Strahler number of a tree is the number of its root node.

[[Algorithm]]ically, these numbers may be assigned by performing a [[depth-first search]] and assigning each node's number in [[postorder]].
The same numbers may also be generated via a pruning process in which the tree is simplified in a sequence of stages, where in each stage one removes all leaf nodes and all of the paths of degree-one nodes leading to leaves: the Strahler number of a node is the stage at which it would be removed by this process, and the Strahler number of a tree is the number of stages required to remove all of its nodes. Another equivalent definition of the Strahler number of a tree is that it is the height of the largest [[complete binary tree]] that can be [[graph homeomorphism|homeomorphically embedded]] into the given tree; the Strahler number of a node in a tree is similarly the height of the largest complete binary tree that can be embedded below that node.

Any node with Strahler number ''i'' must have at least two descendants with Strahler number ''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, at least four descendants with Strahler number  ''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2, etc., and at least 2&lt;sup&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt; leaf descendants. Therefore, in a tree with ''n'' nodes, the largest possible Strahler number is log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.{{sfnp|Devroye|Kruszewski|1996}} However, unless the tree forms a complete binary tree its Strahler number will be less than this bound. In an ''n''-node [[binary tree]], chosen [[random binary tree|uniformly at random among all possible binary trees]], the expected index of the root is with high probability very close to log&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|last1=Devroye|last2=Kruszewski|year=1995|year2=1996|txt}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===River networks===
In the application of the Strahler [[stream order]] to hydrology, each segment of a stream or river within a river network is treated as a node in a tree, with the next segment downstream as its parent. When two '''first-order''' streams come together, they form a '''second-order''' stream. When two second-order streams come together, they form a '''third-order''' stream. Streams of lower order joining a higher order stream do not change the order of the higher stream.  Thus, if a first-order stream joins a second-order stream, it remains a second-order stream. It is not until a second-order stream combines with another second-order stream that it becomes a third-order stream. As with mathematical trees, a segment with index ''i'' must be fed by at least 2&lt;sup&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt; different tributaries of index 1. Shreve noted that Horton’s and Strahler’s Laws should be expected from any topologically random distribution. A later review of the relationships confirmed this argument, establishing that, from the properties the laws describe, no conclusion can be drawn to explain the structure or origin of the stream network.&lt;ref name="Hodgkinson, J.H. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirchner, J.W., 1993. Statistical inevitability of Horton Laws and the apparent randomness of stream channel networks. Geology 21, 591–594.&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify as a stream a hydrological feature must be either recurring or [[perennial stream|perennial]].  Recurring (or "intermittent") streams have water in the channel for at least part of the year. The index of a stream or river may range from 1 (a stream with no tributaries) to 12 (globally the most powerful river, the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], at its mouth).  The [[Ohio River]] is of order eight and the [[Mississippi River]] is of order 10.  Estimates are that 80% of the streams on the planet are first to third order [[headwater stream]]s.&lt;ref name="urlStreamOrder-about.com"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/streamorder.htm
|title=Stream Order – The Classification of Streams and Rivers
|work=
|accessdate=2011-12-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the bifurcation ratio of a river network is low, then there is a higher chance of flooding, as the water will be concentrated in one channel rather than spread out, as a higher bifurcation ratio would indicate. The bifurcation ratio can also show which parts of a drainage basin are more likely to flood, comparatively, by looking at the separate ratios. Most British rivers have a bifurcation ratio of between 3 and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Waugh|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NetworkType.png|thumb|400px|Comparison of incorrect and correct conversion of water bodies to a tree network]]
{{harvtxt|Gleyzer|Denisyuk|Rimmer|Salingar|2004}} describe how to compute Strahler stream order values in a [[Geographic information system|GIS]] application. This algorithm is implemented by [http://www.rivex.co.uk RivEX], an ESRI [[Arcgis|ArcGIS]] 10.2.1 tool. The input to their algorithm is a network of the centre lines of the bodies of water, represented as arcs (or edges) joined at nodes. Lake boundaries and river banks should not be used as arcs, as these will generally form a non-tree network with an incorrect topology.

===Other hierarchical systems===
The Strahler numbering may be applied in the statistical analysis of any hierarchical system, not just to rivers.
* {{harvtxt|Arenas|Danon|Díaz-Guilera|Gleiser|2004}} describe an application of the Horton–Strahler index in the analysis of [[social network]]s.
*{{harvtxt|Ehrenfeucht|Rozenberg|Vermeir|1981}} applied a variant of Strahler numbering (starting with zero at the leaves instead of one), which they called '''tree-rank''', to the analysis of [[L-system]]s.
*Strahler numbering has also been applied to biological hierarchies such as the branching structures of trees&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Borchert|Slade|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of animal respiratory and circulatory systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Horsfield|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Register allocation===
When translating a [[high-level programming language]] to [[assembly language]] the minimum number of [[register allocation|registers]] required to evaluate an expression tree is exactly its Strahler number. In this context, the Strahler number may also be called the '''register number'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ershov|1958}}; {{harvtxt|Flajolet|Raoult|Vuillemin|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For expression trees that require more registers than are available, the [[Sethi–Ullman algorithm]] may be used to translate an expression tree into a sequence of machine instructions that uses the registers as efficiently as possible, minimizing the number of times intermediate values are spilled from registers to main memory and the total number of instructions in the resulting compiled code.

==Related parameters==

===Bifurcation ratio===
Associated with the Strahler numbers of a tree are ''bifurcation ratios'', numbers describing how close to balanced a tree is. For each order ''i'' in a hierarchy, the ''i''th bifurcation ratio is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_{i}}{n_{i+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the number of nodes with order ''i''.

The bifurcation ratio of an overall hierarchy may be taken by averaging the bifurcation ratios at different orders. In a complete binary tree, the bifurcation ratio will be 2, while other trees will have smaller bifurcation ratios.It is a dimensionless number.

===Pathwidth===
The [[pathwidth]] of an arbitrary [[undirected graph]] ''G'' may be defined as the smallest number ''w'' such that there exists an [[interval graph]] ''H'' containing ''G'' as a subgraph, with the largest [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] in ''H'' having ''w''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 vertices. For trees (viewed as undirected graphs by forgetting their orientation and root) the pathwidth differs from the Strahler number, but is closely related to it: in a tree with pathwidth ''w'' and Strahler number ''s'', these two numbers are related by the inequalities&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Luttenberger|Schlund|2011}}, using a definition of the "dimension" of a tree that is one less than the Strahler number.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''w'' ≤ ''s'' ≤ 2''w'' + 2.
The ability to handle graphs with cycles and not just trees gives pathwidth extra versatility compared to the Strahler number.
However, unlike the Strahler number, the pathwidth is defined only for the whole graph, and not separately for each node in the graph.

[[File:Iván Ernesto Gómez Carrasco en la cima del Monte Everest.jpg|thumb|Climbers on the world's highest summit, Mount [[Mount Everest|Everest]].]]
[[File:Monte Rosa summit.jpg|thumb|View from the summit of [[Switzerland]]'s highest, [[Monte Rosa]]]]

A '''summit''' is a point on a surface that is higher in [[elevation]] than all points immediately adjacent to it. [[Mathematics|Mathematically]], a summit is a local [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] in elevation.  The [[topography|topographic]] terms "acme", "apex", [[Pyramidal peak|"peak"]], and "[[zenith]]" are [[synonymous]].

==Definition==
The term "{{vanchor|top}}" is generally used only for a [[mountain]] peak that is located some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation. For example, a big massive rock next to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit. Summits near a higher peak, with some prominence or isolation, but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities, are often considered ''subsummits'' (or ''subpeaks'') of the higher peak, and are considered part of the same mountain. A [[pyramidal peak]] is an exaggerated form produced by ice [[erosion]] of a mountain top.
Summit may also refer to the highest point along a line, trail, or route.

The highest summit in the world is Everest with height of 8844.43 m above [[sea level]] (29,029 ft). The first official ascent was made by [[Tenzing_Norgay|Tenzing Norgay]] and [[Sir Edmund Hillary]]. They reached the mountain`s peak in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/21/part-of-mount-everest-has-collapsed-mountaineers-confirm|title=Mount Everest's Hillary Step has collapsed, mountaineer confirms|last=Lyons|first=Kate|date=2017-05-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/everest/|title=Everest|work=[[National Geographic]]|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UIAA]] definition is that a summit is independent if it has a prominence of {{convert|30|m|ft|lk=on}} or more; it is a mountain if it has a prominence of at least {{convert|300|m|ft}}. This can be summarised as follows:

[[File:SiskiyouSummit.jpg|thumb|Siskiyou Mountain Summit sign along [[Interstate 5]], marking the highest point along the highway at {{convert|4310|ft|abbr=on}}]]
In many parts of the western United States, the term ''summit'' refers to the highest point along a road, highway, or railroad. For example, the highest point along [[Interstate 80]] in [[California]] is referred to as [[Donner Summit]] and the highest point on [[Interstate 5]] is [[Siskiyou Summit|Siskiyou Mountain Summit]].

==Summit climbing equipment==
A summit climbing differs from the common [[mountaineering]]. Summit expedition requires: 1+ year of training, a good physical shape, and a [[Climbing gear|special gear]]. Although a huge part of climber’s stuff can be left and taken at the base camps or given to porters, there is a long list of personal equipment. In addition to common mountaineers’ gear, Summit climbers need to take [[Diamox]] (anti-altitude sickness medication), masks, and bottles of [[oxygen]]. There are also special requirements for [[crampons]], [[ice axe]], rappel device, clothing, etc.

'''The Planetworkshops''' are a [[think tank]] that combine reflection and action with the goal of promoting [[sustainable development]] and initiating transformations of society models. The Planetworkshops were created in 2006 by Eric Bazin(founder of ''Satelight''&lt;ref name="Bazin"&gt;http://www.omegatv.tv/chroniqueur/eric-bazin&lt;/ref&gt;) and George J. Gendelman (former Director of the [[New York Times]] and of the [[International Herald Tribune]]).

The Planetworkshops encourage intellectual innovation in order to question societies and develop practical solutions to social, environmental, cultural and economic issues.

The purpose of the Planetworkshops is to challenge the life of ideas, encourage intellectual innovation and produce expertise to accompany the long term vision of decision makers. Definitely turned towards action, the Planetworkshops also focus on the development of successful and useful experiences and spread good practices in order to favor necessary changes towards sustainable models.

The Planetworkshops gather politicians, scientists, experts, economists, medias and NGOs in order to guide decision making towards sustainable development and rebuild new societal models.&lt;ref&gt;http://reseauecoleetnature.org/evenement/les-ateliers-de-la-terre.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Gendelman''', American, is the former manager of the international operations of the ''New York Times Syndication Sales'' and former circulation director of the ''International Herald Tribune''; he founded and still manages the ''International Press Syndicate'' in 1990, a consulting agency dedicated to media strategy and copyright management for international media groups.&lt;ref name="Gendelman"&gt;http://www.omegatv.tv/chroniqueur/george-gendelman&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

=== Production of ideas and content ===

==== Working Commissions ====
Constant provider of solutions for change, the Planetworkshops initiate multi-actors and trans-disciplinary working commissions gathering qualified and recognized experts.
These working commissions prepare synthesis notes composed of concrete and realistic proposals to the attention of political and economic decisions-makers. By this work, the Planetworkshops wish to help deepen the debate around very complex topics.
The results of these works are presented during the Planetworkshops’ Global Conference in Evian, France.
Since 2011, six working commissions were undertaken by the Planetworkshops:

-	"Internationalizing the social entrepreneurship model", in partnership with [http://www.groupe-sos.org/en SOS Group];

-	"Social and environmental responsibility: transforming businesses governance", in partnership with [[:fr:Terra Nova (think tank)|Terra Nova]];

-	"Mediation as a Solution to Environmental Dispute"s, in partnership with [[:fr:ESSEC IRENE|ESSEC-IRENE]];

-	“How to reinvent the model of international negotiations on climate change?", exclusively composed from students issued from school and universities world-wide;

-	"Crossed views on genetic biodiversity resources and their equal sharing", in partnership with Orée;

-	"What conditions for the emergence of a "Blue Society"?", in partnership with Green Cross France and Territories

==== "La Revue de la Terre" ====
« La Revue de la Terre » is a French geopolitical publication on environmental issues, sustainable development and mutation of societies. This French publication was launched by the Planetworkshops, on the occasion of the third edition of the Global Conference.
This now quarterly confidential letter is addressed to opinion leaders, elected officials, local authorities, industry, SMEs with growth envisaged through this new economic challenge. Its geopolitical axis analyses the different levers of industry but also highlights mainstream players and initiatives that will shape tomorrow.

==== Report for decision makers: Summary and priorities for decision makers ====
In order to highlight the important trends of a world in transition and to show that the sheer breadth of sustainable development does not exclude prioritizing essential actions, the Planetworkshops, in collaboration with Pricewaterhouse Coopes (PwC), have written this annual report to the use of decision makers. This review is the result of an annual analysis of the progress in the knowledge and understanding of threats to sustainability. It will serve as a guide to ensure the continuity of long-term policies.
This report adopts an economical approach combining:
-	An analysis of the situation and the global geopolitical and economic trends favoring progress towards greater sustainability.
-	A global and thematic summary of the major international sustainable development conferences.

Throughout this report, PwC and the Planetworkshops’ have attempted to give perspective and legibility to the multiple issues that must be identified by the decision makers of the 21st century. They must show that they are conscious of the increasing scarcity of the resources for an ongoing increase of human kind.

==== The White Book ====
The [http://www.planetworkshops.org/en/220/white-paper-2011/ GC 2011 White Book] highlights the most important moments of the Planetworkshops' Global Conference.
The White book issued from the VIth edition of the Global Conference (September 2011)was part of the documents that contributed to the UN preparation for the [[Rio+20|2012 Earth Summit (Rio+20)]].

===A link between stakeholders===

==== The Global Conference ====
[[File:Global Conference.jpg|thumbnail|right|290px|Global Conference 2010]]
The ''Global Conference – International Forum for a Sustainable Development'', is an international forum which gathers annually decision-makers and opinion leaders committed for a sustainable development. In a few years, the Global Conference has become a major international meeting, gathering during three days more than 900 actors from 70 countries involved in the change for a sustainable society.
Business managers, entrepreneurs, government officials, public authorities, leaders of NGOs and associations, intellectuals, researchers, experts, artists, media and representatives of civil society meet to think together the solutions needed to build a new model of development, more responsible and respectful of humans and the environment. 
In a friendly and unique atmosphere, "Planetworkers" meet to exchange and share their good practices, to highlight innovative initiatives and to participate in the transformation of society.

==== ''The Global Conference - Rabat Round'' ====
The Planetworkshops spread their actions in Morocco and organize the first edition of the ''Global Conference - Rabat Round'', on the 16th and 17 May 2011.
International implementation of the Global Conference abroad, the ''Rabat Round'' tries to preserve an interdisciplinary approach and deals with the specific stakes and challenges of Morocco and in its region. The Planetworkshops maintain their identity: a friendly place of reflection on sustainable development issues and the necessary transformations of our societies; a platform of diverse actors; a transverse approach and the presentation of concrete and existing solutions.
In many respects, Morocco is a leader in sustainable development and the country represents today a real open-air laboratory of this new model of development. Renewable energies, conservation of natural resources, smart cities, sustainable mobility, waste management, sustainable agriculture or responsible tourism, are some of the local stakes which were discussed in Rabat in May 2012.

The green growth and its economic, social and human development potential, central themes of the next Rio+20 Conference, will therefore be at the heart of the reflection.

Participants from over more than 30 countries come to assert their peculiarity and their desire of a sustainable development applied with ambition to their respective territories, to share good practices and duplicate them all over the world.

====Sustainable Useful Network (S.U.N.)====
The Planetworkshops is creating a global network of companies and committed organizations, or having begun a process towards sustainability. S.U.N is a network of exchanges which bases its activities on the collection, the treatment  and the circulation of information corresponding to precise  criteria.
Information is designed on the basis of good practices, actions and initiatives, already involved, with innovative potential,  which implement social and environmental responsibility and/or sustainable development, and which produce results even if they are experimental.

==== International Forum Green Business - Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo ====
The world awareness of the depletion of natural resources and the consequences of the climate change impose a strengthening of the legislation and a progressive change of behaviors. These two phenomena establish opportunities for [[Green business|Green Business]] for the whole world and of course for Africa specifically. 
The objective of these three days conference is to combine growth opportunities; sharing experiences and fight against poverty, through [[Green economy|Green Economy]]. This will lead to structure the point of view of [[Central Africa|Central Africa’s]] private sector on the way to [[Rio+20|Rio+ 20 Conference]].

==== The Rethink Awards ====
The Rethink Awards stimulate economic growth and innovation through implementable and viable business models by rewarding small companies, students and young journalists who invent and testify of new economic models to face the major challenges of [[sustainable development]] today. They will have successfully found a way to turn an important issue of our time into an opportunity of development.
The aim of the Rethink Awards is to identify, analyze and value the development of companies striving to find new paths to efficiently respond to the actual issues ([[global warming]], [[Non-renewable resource|rarefaction of natural resources]], social disequilibrium, etc.)
They encourage the commitment of the [[private sector]] towards a sustainable development, both in [[OECD]] and non-OECD countries.
They invite students to be creative, to think differently and to dare new [[business models]] carrying solutions for change and for the future. 
They stimulate young journalists to highlight innovations and trends that could revolutionize our [[economic models]], to reflect on the transformation or crucial issues into opportunities of development and to integrate the new techniques of information and communication in this perspective.

==== "Meaning and Sustainable Development" Meeting ====
"Meaning and sustainable development" mobilizes the reflection on the meaning of our actions and our daily commitments in favor of a [[Sustainable development|responsible development]].

Crises are consecutive; sustainable development is slowing down, and all because the meaning of actions is not always clear. Promoting exchanges between individuals sensitive to the core values of sustainable development, these meetings aim to make evolve companies and the economy’s vision for a practical and effective mobilization.

Between sharing experiences and ideas for action through individuals which were able to implement responsible practices, the first edition of "Meaning and sustainable development" was held on the 2nd and 3 December 2011 at the Bourdaisière castle in Montlouis-sur-Loire (France), an active laboratory of sustainable development.

=== Field Programs ===

==== Edurable "Imagine your city of tomorrow" ====
The association "Edurable" was created to encourage the establishment of programs dedicated to education for sustainable development in sensitive areas - Priority Education Zones especially in the suburbs of large French cities. It enjoys the support of the Prefecture of Paris and the Ile-de-France to identify geographic areas and populations of young recipients of these experiments.

Education for sustainable development in sensitive areas and the suburbs is to strengthen the educational component of a comprehensive policy for sustainable development in particular towards people excluded from its scope. This results in the realization of field experiences to an audience of children in primary, middle and high schools.
New Technologies of Information and Communication (ICT) are the preferred tool to achieve these initiatives.
In this context the association Edurable, with the support of the Prefecture of Paris and IBM France, has launched "Imagine your town tomorrow” for children from 5 to 7 years. This program aims to promote education for Sustainable Development through ICTs and to bring the perspective of these children on their vision of the city, first in Paris.

==== Lighting a Billion Lives (LaBL) ====
Over 1.4 billion people in the world lack access to electricity. Inadequate lighting is not only an impediment to progress and development opportunities, but also has a direct impact on the health, environment, and safety of millions of people,etc. 
Recognizing the need to change this, [[The Energy and Resources Institute|TERI (The Energy and Resources Institute)]] with its commitment to creating innovative solutions for a better tomorrow, has undertaken since 2007 an initiative of [http://labl.teriin.org/ 'Lighting a Billion Lives' (LaBL)] through the use of solar lighting devices to replace kerosene lamps and paraffin candles, and thereby providing opportunities for livelihoods both at the individual and village level. Indeed, bringing clean and affordable sources of lighting into the lives of people facilitates education of children, provides better illumination and kerosene-smoke-free indoor environment for women to do household chores, and has many environmental and socio-economic co-benefits.

LaBL has since 2007 been developed to benefit many more people around the world. It is now in the process of expanding to the African continent, with pilot projects in Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, Uganda, Malawi, Kenya, Ethiopia and Mozambique. '''TERI and Planetworkshops are joining hands in the endeavor of also bringing LaBL into the lives of the villagers of Niger.'''

==== Agroecology in Niger ====
The Planetworkshops opened in May 2011 a center in Niamey (Niger). In Partnership with Point Afrique solidarités and the [[Pierre Rabhi Foundation]], the Planetworkshops initiate a training center in agroecology located 150&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Niamey]], at the Hotel La Tapoa. This center aims to help farmers free themselves from extensive financial charges created by the annual purchase of input locations and allow them to improve their [[Crop yield|yield]] while protecting [[biodiversity]], their productions and their crops.

==== UNESCO Chair in Togo ====
The DESS "Woman, Water and Health" will be the only one existing on this topic in [[Togo]] and [[Francophone West Africa]]. It currently involves [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]]. This Planetworkshops’ chair was founded with the [[Bolloré Group]].

'''[[Paraguay]]''' observes [[UTC−04:00]] for standard time, and [[UTC−03:00]] for [[daylight saving time]].

==Daylight saving time==
Paraguay observes DST under decree 1867 of March 5, 2004. DST ends on the second Sunday of March and starts on the first Sunday of October.

In 2007, DST started on October 15, 2006 and ended on March 11, 2007.

In 2010, [[Paraguay]] changed its own DST rules because of the energy crisis, ending DST on the second Sunday in April, a month later than previous years. The start date remains unchanged.

[[File:Portrait of a European.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a European painted by Mughal artists, Ca.1590]]
Contact between Western Europe and the Mughal empire was put into practice in the very beginning of the 17th century. The Portuguese, English, and later on, the Dutch were the ones to trade with the [[Mughal empire]]. As the first Islamic power on the Indian subcontinent, the Mughal empire was more interested in assimilating the land, studying the history, customs and religion of the people occupying this area, and communicating with the other two Islamic empires – the [[Saffavid]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]s. 
The Mughal empire was blessed with very strong leaders, however, very different in approach and strategy. [[Akbar]] was known for his tolerance towards unorthodox Muslims and Hindus. The [[Akbarnama]], a book written by Abu’l Fazl on the life and rule of Akbar, gives a lot of evidence on how [[Hinduism]] was viewed and explained by the Muslims. Along with being tolerant towards his Hindu and Muslim subjects, Akbar welcomed Portuguese [[Jesuits]], which allowed Portugal to enter the trade with Indian goods. At the very end of his rule, the British, Dutch, and Portuguese started trade with the Mughal empire as well. Even though the trade started during the reign of Akbar the Great, his son [[Jahangir]] was the one to strengthen this economic activity in the Indian subcontinent.

== Premises of Western Europe for the trade ==

The English and Dutch were granted 21-year permission of monopoly in the “[[East Indies]]”, which followed by the retorted answer from the Indian landlords – they encouraged the establishment of coastal posts for trade.  Half a century afterwards, the competition for trade in the [[Indian Ocean]] was enhanced by the setting up of the [[British East India Company]] in 1664. It followed [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]]'s theory of [[Mercantilism]] that claimed to keep the national exports greater than the imports. In his Memorandum on English Alliances and Memorandum to the King on Finances written in 1669 and 1670 respectively, Jean-Baptiste Colbert defended his theory and tried to figure out a way of how to undercut the Dutch trade. This document gave evidence on the strength of the [[Netherlands]]’ trade in the 17th century not only in India but also in the [[Caribbean]]. Moreover, it gave the precise numbers of the Dutch superiority over both the British and the French – 15,000 to 16,000 vessels per year versus 3,000 to 4,000 for the British and 500 to 600 for the French. The British managed to increase the trade with textile with 22.7 million square meters over a period of just twenty years. They did that in the same year that France intervened in the Indian trade.

== The need for alcohol established the first trading contacts ==

One of the items traded was alcohol drinks. During [[Babur]]’s and Jahangir’s reign the trade was especially directed towards alcohol exchange. It probably was the same during the rest of the Great Mughals' reigns but the autobiographies and court chronicles had very little information about this issue. Moreover, these sources cannot be very reliable because the emperors reviewed them. However, there are records and journals written by individuals that were either travelling or were members of the Mughal court, which strongly suggest the overuse of alcohol and its social connection within the people and castes. The Great Mughals were not only connoisseurs of alcohol, they were often overusing it, too. Jahangir died of alcohol abuse.{{Citation needed|reason=cannot verify information on internet sources|date=April 2015}} Alcohol was also considered a gift of goodwill, especially between sailors and merchants. Evidence of that were the records and journals of the British East India company. Its employees often requested for wine supply for themselves and for gifts for the monarch. It was used not only for special occasions but also as a regular act of just revering the emperor. Jahangir was the emperor who was the most associated to alcohol but all the rest of the Great Mughals appreciated it too, with the exception of Aurangzeb (who loathed it). Wine and alcohol in general was as well used for negotiations and, was therefore a very important part of the trading process.

== The implementation of trade on the local level in India and the various trading posts ==

The trade in [[India]] was implemented mainly on the coast. During the 17th century there were two big countries.

== The detrimental outcomes of the trade on the Mughal empire ==

Two and a half centuries of trade between India and Western Europe led to the downfall of an initially agriculturally-orientated empire with strong military forces and tolerance towards its subjects and their different religious beliefs (with the exception of [[Aurangzeb]]). All three Islamic empires found either their collapse or a significant weakening by the 19th century. European countries, however, were growing, expanding, developing, coming up with new movements, inventions, technology. Even though they were essentially separated by the Ottoman and Safavid empire, the common interest, the trade, helped Europe to permanently settle into the Indian lands. The most comprehensive and clear sources about the Mughal empire were the factory records of the British East India company, which suggests that trade was the only way of communication between Western Europe and the Mughal empire. The trade was carried out by the same countries, only there were variations of the proportion of import for those countries, depending on what was going on at that time in Europe and on the alliances the countries tight themselves into. The pattern of [[Globalization]] and World entanglement was traced in 17th century through trade. This way the European countries found their place in the Mughal empire, gradually gaining more power over the trade and, consequently, over the empire until the British colonized the Indian subcontinent in the 19th century.
The European language was primarily spread amongst coastal regions, in particular large trading centres and sometimes throughout big commercial towns which were based inland.
