'''António Henrique Rodrigo de Oliveira Marques''' (23 August 1933 - 23 January 2007) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[historian]].

==Life==
Oliveira Marques was born in the '[[freguesia]]' of [[Estoril|S. João do Estoril]], [[Cascais]].

He studied [[history]] and [[philosophy]] and graduated in 1956 from the University of Lisbon with a [[thesis]] entitled ''A Sociedade em Portugal nos Séculos XII a XIV'' (''Portuguese Society from 12th to 14th Centuries''). After training in the University of Würzburg, in Germany, he would start teaching the following year at the University of Lisbon and received his doctorate in 1960. His PhD. dissertation was entitled ''Hansa e Portugal na Idade Média'' (''[[Hanseatic League]] and Portugal in the [[Middle Ages]]'').

In 1962, his participation in student strikes against the right-wing regime of [[Oliveira Salazar]] resulted in his dismissal from the university as a scholar. He left for the [[United States]] where he taught history at a number of universities ([[Auburn University|Auburn]], [[University of Florida|Florida]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Minnesota system|Minnesota]] and [[University of Chicago|Chicago]]) between 1965 and 1970.

Oliveira Marques returned to Portugal in 1970, but only resumed teaching at Portuguese universities in 1974, the year in which the [[Carnation Revolution]] ended almost five decades of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.

From October 1974 to April 1976, he was director of the National Library of Lisbon.

In 1998, he was granted the Grand Cross of the Order of Liberty, a state accolade which distinguishes figures who have made a contribution to the values of civilization.

==Work==
Considered one of Portugal's greatest experts on Portuguese [[Medieval]] history, he wrote more than 60 books and numerous articles. One of his most famous works, ''A History of Portugal'', is translated into several languages.

Some of his works include:
* ''A Sociedade em Portugal nos Séculos XII a XIV''
* ''Hansa e Portugal na Idade Média''
* ''Introdução à História da Agricultura em Portugal''
* ''A Sociedade Medieval Portuguesa: aspectos da vida quotidiana''
* ''Guia do Estudante de História Medieval Portuguesa''
* ''História de Portugal'' (''A History of Portugal'', has been translated to English, French, Japanese, Polish and Spanish.)
* ''Nova História de Portugal'' (coordinator, with [[Joel Serrão]])
* ''Nova História da Expansão Portuguesa'' (coordinator, with [[Joel Serrão]])
* ''História dos Portugueses no Extremo Oriente'' (coordinator)
* ''História da Maçonaria em Portugal''

First, the predators approach their potential prey. Predators bite or try to swallow the hagfishes, but the hagfishes have already projected jets of slime (arrows) into the predators' mouths. Choking, the predators release the hagfishes and gag in an attempt to remove slime from their mouths and gill chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zintzen | first1=Vincent | last2=Roberts | first2=Clive D. | last3=Anderson | first3=Marti J. | last4=Stewart | first4=Andrew L. | last5=Struthers | first5=Carl D. | last6=Harvey | first6=Euan S. | title=Hagfish Slime as a Defense Mechanism against Gill-breathing Predators | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=1 | page=2011 | doi=10.1038/srep00131| year=2011 | bibcode=2011NatSR...1E.131Z | pmid=22355648 | pmc=3216612}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Anti-predator adaptations''' are mechanisms developed through [[evolution]] that assist [[prey]] organisms in their constant struggle against [[predator]]s. Throughout the animal kingdom, adaptations have evolved for every stage of this struggle, namely by avoiding detection, warding off attack, fighting back, or escaping when caught.

The first line of defence consists in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as [[camouflage]], [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerade]], [[apostatic selection]], living underground, or [[nocturnal]]ity. 

Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in [[aposematism]], by [[mimicry|mimicking]] animals which do possess such defences, by [[deimatic behaviour|startling]] the attacker, by [[signalling theory|signalling to the predator]] that pursuit is not worthwhile, by [[distraction display|distraction]], by using defensive structures such as spines, and by [[social animal|living in a group]]. Members of groups are at [[selfish herd theory|reduced risk of predation]], despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and the likelihood that the predator will attack some other individual.

Some prey species are capable of fighting back against predators, whether [[autohaemorrhaging|with chemicals]], through [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|communal defence]], or by ejecting noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. 

Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by [[autotomy|sacrificing certain body parts]]: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape.

==Avoiding detection==

===Staying out of sight===
{{main article|Nocturnality}}
[[File:Seychelles Fruit Bat - Pteropus seychellensis.jpg|thumb|[[Fruit bat]]s forage [[nocturnality|by night]] to avoid predators.]]

Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether [[Troglobite|in caves]], [[Fossorial|underground]], or by being [[nocturnality|nocturnal]].&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cott, H.B. |date=1940 |title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals |publisher=Methuen |location=London |pages=330–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duverge | first1=P.L. | last2=Jones | first2=G | last3=Rydell | first3=J. | last4=Ransome | first4=R. | date=2000 | title=Functional significance of emergence timing in bats | journal=Ecography | volume=23 | pages=32–40 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.2000.tb00258.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Daly | first1=M. | last2=Behrends | first2=P.R. | last3=Wilson | first3=M. | last4=Jacobs | first4=L. | date=1992 | title=Behavioural modulation of predation risk: moonlight avoidance and crepuscular compensation in a nocturnal desert rodent, Dipodomys merriami | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=44 | pages=1–9 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80748-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called [[crypsis]] used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating [[bats]]. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from [[bat hawk]]s and [[bat falcon]]s. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"/&gt;
Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in [[kangaroo rat]]s, which avoid moonlight. They forage in relatively open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"/&gt;

[[File:Phrynosoma mcallii.jpg|thumb|right|[[Camouflage]] illustrated by the [[flat-tail horned lizard]], its flattened, fringed and [[disruptively patterned]] body eliminating shadow]]

===Camouflage===
{{main article|Camouflage}}

[[Camouflage]] uses any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, [[disruptive coloration]], shadow elimination by [[countershading]] or [[counter-illumination]], self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and colour.{{sfn|Cott|1940}}{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=35–60}} Animals such as the [[flat-tail horned lizard]] of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and blend in with the ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. In addition, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117&gt;{{cite book | author=Sherbrooke, W. C. |date=2003 | title=Introduction to horned lizards of North America | publisher=University of California Press |pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masquerade===
[[File:Kallima inachus qtl1.jpg|thumb|''[[Kallima inachus]]'' [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as a dead leaf]]

Animals can hide in plain sight by [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as inedible objects. For example, the [[potoo]], a South American bird, habitually perches on a tree, convincingly resembling a broken stump of a branch,{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=53–55}} while a butterfly, ''[[Kallima]]'', looks just like a dead leaf.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=318–320}}

===Apostatic selection===

Another way to remain unattacked in plain sight is to look different from other members of the same species. Predators such as [[Parus|tits]] selectively hunt for abundant types of insect, ignoring less common types that were present, forming [[search image]]s of the desired prey. This creates a mechanism for negative [[frequency-dependent selection]], [[apostatic selection]].{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=61–65}}

==Warding off attack==
[[File:Gottesanbeterin Abwehr.JPG|thumb|A Mediterranean [[mantis]], ''[[Iris oratoria]]'', attempting to startle a predator with [[deimatic behaviour]]]]

Many species make use of behavioral strategies to deter predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper |first1=William E |title=Antipredatory Behavior |url=http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/antipredatory_behavior_1/story.htm |website=IDEA |publisher=University of California, Riverside |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Startling the predator===
{{main article|Deimatic behaviour}}

Many weakly-defended animals, including [[moth]]s, [[butterflies]], [[Mantidae|mantises]], [[Phasmidae|phasmids]], and [[cephalopods]] such as octopuses, make use of patterns of threatening or [[deimatic behaviour|startling behaviour]], such as suddenly displaying conspicuous [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]], so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. In the absence of toxins or other defences, this is essentially bluffing, in contrast to aposematism which involves honest signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1464793105006810 |author=Stevens, Martin |authorlink=Martin Stevens (biologist) |title=The role of eyespots as anti-predator mechanisms, principally demonstrated in the Lepidoptera |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=80 |issue=4 |date=2005 |pages=573–588 |pmid=16221330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/86053.html | title=Deimatic Behavior | publisher=Springer | date=2012 | accessdate=31 December 2012 | author=Edmunds, Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.conchsoc.org/node/6014 | title=Octopus vulgaris. Dymantic display | publisher=The Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland | date=3 December 2012 | accessdate=1 January 2013 | author=Smith, Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pursuit-deterrent signals===
{{further information|Signalling theory}}
[[File:Stotting gazelle.jpg|thumb|An [[impala]] [[stotting]], [[signalling honestly]] to the predator that the chase will be unprofitable]]

Pursuit-deterrent signals are behavioral signals used by prey that convince predators not to pursue them. For example, [[gazelle]]s [[stotting|stot]], jumping high with stiff legs and an arched back. This is thought to signal to predators that they have a high level of fitness and can outrun the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely to outrun them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caro, T. M. |authorlink=Tim Caro |date=1986 |title=The functions of stotting in Thomson's gazelles: Some tests of the predictions |journal=Animal Behaviour |issue=3 |pages=663–684 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(86)80052-5 |volume=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[White-tailed deer]] and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous (often black and white) tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bildstein |first1=Keith L. |title=Why White-Tailed Deer Flag Their Tails |journal=The American Naturalist |date=May 1983 |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=709–715 |doi=10.1086/284096 |jstor=2460873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warning calls given by birds such as the [[Eurasian jay]] are similarly [[honest signal]]s, benefiting both predator and prey: the predator is informed that it has been detected and might as well save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bergstrom |first=C. T. |last2=Lachmann |first2=M. |year=2001 |title=Alarm calls as costly signals of antipredator vigilance: the watchful babbler game |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=535–543 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Getty |first=T. |year=2002 |title=The discriminating babbler meets the optimal diet hawk |journal=Anim. Behav. |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=397H. Carl 402 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2001.1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playing dead===
{{main article|apparent death}}
[[File:Heterodon platirhinos 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eastern hog-nosed snake]] [[Apparent death|playing dead]]]]

Another pursuit-deterrent signal is [[apparent death|thanatosis or playing dead]]. Thanatosis is a form of bluff in which an animal mimics its own dead body, [[deception|feigning]] death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pasteur | first1=G | date=1982 | title=A classificatory review of mimicry systems | url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=13 | pages=169–199 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of this is seen in white-tailed deer fawns, which experience a drop in heart rate in response to approaching predators. This response, referred to as "alarm bradycardia", causes the fawn's heart rate to drop from 155 to 38 beats per minute within one beat of the heart. This drop in heart rate can last up to two minutes, causing the fawn to experience a depressed breathing rate and decrease in movement, called tonic immobility. Tonic immobility is a reflex response that causes the fawn to enter a low body position that simulates the position of a dead corpse. Upon discovery of the fawn, the predator loses interest in the "dead" prey. Other symptoms of alarm bradycardia, such as salivation, urination, and defecation, can also cause the predator to lose interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alboni | first1=Paolo | last2=Alboni | first2=Marco | last3=Bertorelle | first3=Giorgio | date=2008 | title=The origin of vasovagal syncope: to protect the heart or to escape predation? | journal=Clinical Autonomic Research | volume=18 | issue=4| pages=170–8 | doi=10.1007/s10286-008-0479-7| pmid=18592129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mimicry and aposematism===
{{main article|mimicry|aposematism}}
[[File:BatesMimButter.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|left|alt=Viceroy and monarch butterflies illustrate Müllerian mimicry|[[Viceroy butterfly|Viceroy]] and [[monarch butterfly|monarch]] are [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]], similar in appearance, unpalatable to predators.]]

[[Mimicry]] occurs when an organism (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This results in the mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Endler, J. A. |title=An overview of the relationships between mimicry and crypsis |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |date=1981 |volume=16 |pages=25–31 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1981.tb01840.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian.

[[File:Erethizon dorsatum du Québec.jpg|thumb|The porcupine ''[[Erethizon dorsatum]]'' combines sharp [[spine (zoology)|spines]] with [[warning coloration]]]]

===Defensive structures===

Many animals are protected against predators with armour in the form of hard shells (such as most [[mollusc]]s), leathery or scaly skin (as in [[reptile]]s), or tough chitinous exoskeletons (as in [[arthropod]]s).{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|page=198}}

A [[spine (zoology)|spine]] is a sharp, needle-like structure used to inflict pain on predators. An example of this seen in nature is in the [[Sohal surgeonfish]]. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine on the front of each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Craig. Scott, Susan. (1997). ''All Stings Considered''. University of Hawaii Press. pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish.&lt;ref name="Vincent1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Vincent | first1=J. F.

[[File:Stinging Rose caterpillars, Megan McCarty65.jpg|thumb|upright|Stinging [[Limacodidae]] slug moth [[caterpillar]]s]]

Many species of slug caterpillar, [[Limacodidae]], have numerous protuberances and stinging spines along their dorsal surfaces. Species that possess these stinging spines suffer less predation than larvae that lack them, and a predator, the [[paper wasp]], chooses larvae without spines when given a choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Murphy | first1=Shannon M. | last2=Leahy | first2=Susannah M. | last3=Williams | first3=Laila S. | last4=Lill | first4=John T. | date=2010 | title=Stinging spines protect slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) from multiple generalist predators | journal=Behavioral Ecology | volume=21 | issue=1| pages=153–160 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arp166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety in numbers==
{{further information|Social animal}}

Group living can decrease the risk of predation to the individual in a variety of ways,{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=202–207}} as described below.

===Dilution effect===

A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group "dilute" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] and [[W.D. Hamilton]] proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in [[Camargue horse]]s in Southern France. The [[horse-fly]] often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duncan | first1=P. | last2=Vigne | first2=N. | date=1979 | title=The effect of group size in horses on the rate of attacks by blood-sucking flies | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=27 | pages=623–625 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(79)90201-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water striders]] are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Foster | first1=W.A. | last2=Treherne | first2=J.E. | date=1981 | title=Evidence for the dilution effect in the selfish herd from fish predation on a marine insect | journal=Nature | volume=295 | pages=466–467 | doi=10.1038/293466a0| bibcode=1981Natur.293..466F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domain of Danger Graphic.jpg|thumb|In a group, prey seek central positions in order to reduce their domain of danger. Individuals along the outer edges of the group are more at risk of being targeted by the predator.]]

===Selfish herd===

{{main article|Selfish herd theory}}

The selfish herd theory was proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton]] to explain why animals seek central positions in a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Hamilton | authorlink=W. D. Hamilton | first1=W. | title=Geometry for the selfish herd | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=31 | issue=2 | pages=295–311 | date=1971 | pmid=5104951 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(71)90189-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory's central idea is to reduce the individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in which the individual is more likely to be attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals are predicted to strive constantly to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied [[brown fur seal]] predation from [[great white shark]]s. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.&lt;ref name="De Vos ORiain 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last=De Vos | first=A. | last2=O'Riain | first2=M.

===Predator satiation===
[[File:White cicada.jpg|thumb|left|A newly emerged [[Magicicada|periodical cicada]]: millions emerge at once, at long intervals, likely to [[predator satiation|satiate predators]].]]

{{main article|Predator satiation|Periodical cicada}}

A radical strategy for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill a large majority of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the [[periodical cicadas]], which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so [[predator satiation]] is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams, K.S. |author2=C. Simon |last-author-amp=yes |date=1995 |title=The ecology, behavior, and evolution of periodical cicadas |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |volume=40 |pages=269–295 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.40.010195.001413 |url=http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/projects/cicada/resources/reprints/Williams%26Simon_1995.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chlorocebus pygerythrus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chlorocebus pygerythrus|Vervet monkeys]] have different [[alarm signal]]s that warn of attacks by [[eagle]]s, [[leopard]]s and [[snake]]s.]]

===Alarm calls===

{{main article|Alarm signal}}

Animals that live in groups often give [[alarm signal|alarm calls]] that give warning of an attack. For example, [[vervet monkey]]s give different calls depending on the nature of the attack: for an [[eagle]], a disyllabic cough; for a [[leopard]] or other cat, a loud bark; for a [[python (genus)|python]] or other snake, a "chutter". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they look up and run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and look around for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1=John|author1link=John Maynard Smith|last2=Harper|first2=David|title=Animal Signals|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19852-685-8|pages=113–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improved vigilance===

[[File:Circus hudsonius Recurvirostra americana.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4&lt;!--width for low image--&gt;|A raptor, a [[Circus hudsonius|northern harrier]], chases up an alert flock of [[Recurvirostra americana|American avocets]].]]

In the improved vigilance effect, groups are able to detect predators sooner than solitary individuals.{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=115–149}} For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, [[Common wood pigeon|wood pigeon]] flocks are preyed upon by [[goshawk]]s. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, the more likely it is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(73)90184-7|pmid=4734745|author=Pulliam, H. R.|title=On the advantages of flocking|volume=38|year=1973|journal=J. Theor. Biol.|pages=419–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild [[ostrich]]es in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises its head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1016/S0003-3472(80)80030-3|title=Vigilance and group size in ostriches|journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=28|issue=1|pages=278–286|author=Bertram, Brian C. |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zebras Serengeti.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;|A single [[zebra]] is hard to catch amongst a herd.]]

===Predator confusion===

Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The [[zebra]] has been suggested by the zoologist [[Martin Stevens (biologist)|Martin Stevens]] and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering [[motion dazzle]] effect in the eye of the predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-9-81|title=Motion dazzle and camouflage as distinct anti-predator defenses|pmid=22117898 | volume=9|pmc=3257203|year=2011|journal=BMC Biol.|pages=81 | last1 = Stevens | first1 = M | last2 = Searle | first2 = WT | last3 = Seymour | first3 = JE | last4 = Marshall | first4 = KL | last5 = Ruxton | first5 = GD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fighting back==

Defensive structures such as spines may be used both to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against a predator.&lt;ref name="Vincent1986"/&gt; Methods of fighting back include chemical defences,{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|pages=64–69}} mobbing,&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; defensive regurgitation,&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt; and suicidal altruism.&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"/&gt;

Some prey animals are able to eject noxious materials to deter predators actively.

A few vertebrate species such as the [[Texas horned lizard]] are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened.

The slime glands along the body of the [[hagfish]] secrete enormous amounts of mucus when it is provoked or stressed. The gelatinous slime has dramatic effects on the flow and viscosity of water, rapidly clogging the gills of any fish that attempt to capture hagfish; predators typically release the hagfish within seconds ''(pictured above)''. Common predators of hagfish include seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, but few fish, suggesting that predatory fish avoid hagfish as prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lim | first1=Jeanette | last2=Fudge | first2=Douglas F. | last3=Levy | first3=Nimrod | last4=Gosline | first4=John M. | date=2006 | title=Hagfish Slime Ecomechanics: testing the gill-clogging mechanics | journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=209 |  pages=702–10 | doi=10.1242/jeb.02067 | pmid=16449564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communal defence===
{{further information|Mobbing (animal behavior)}}
[[File:MuskOxen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7&lt;!--size for very low image--&gt;|Group of [[muskox]]en in defensive formation, horns ready, and highly alert]]

In communal defence, prey groups actively defend themselves by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing themselves to be passive victims of predation. [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|Mobbing]] is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, [[red colobus]] monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by [[chimpanzees]], a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stanford | first1=Craig B | title=The influence of chimpanzee predation on group size and anti-predator behavior in red colobus monkeys | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=49 | issue=3| pages=577–587 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)90033-0| year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fieldfares]] are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Andersson | first1=Malte | last2=Wiklund | first2=Christer G. | title=Clumping versus spacing out: Experiments on nest predation in fieldfares (''Turdus pilaris'') | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=26 | issue=4| pages=1207–1212 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(78)90110-0 | year=1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defensive regurgitation===
[[File:Defensive Regurgitation.png|thumb|left|A [[northern fulmar]] chick protects itself with a jet of [[stomach oil]].]]

Some birds and insects use defensive regurgitation to ward off predators. The [[northern fulmar]] vomits a bright orange, oily substance called [[stomach oil]] when threatened.&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warham | first1 = John | date = 1977|url=http://newzealandecology.org/nzje/2787.pdf | title = The Incidence, Functions and Ecological Significance of Petrel Stomach Oils | journal = New Zealand Ecological Society | volume = 24 | pages = 84–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading to the loss of flying ability and the loss of water repellency.&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt; This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from [[hypothermia]] when diving for food.&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt;

[[European roller]] chicks vomit a bright orange, foul smelling liquid when they sense danger. This repels prospective predators and may alert their parents to danger: they respond by delaying their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Parejo | first1=D | last2=Avilés | first2=JM | last3=Peña | first3=A | last4=Sánchez | first4=L | last5=Ruano | first5=F | display-authors=etal  | date=2013 | title=Armed Rollers: Does Nestling's Vomit Function as a Defence against Predators? | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=8 | issue=7| page=e68862 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0068862 | pmid=23874791 | pmc=3707886| bibcode=2013PLoSO...868862P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous insects utilize defensive regurgitation. The [[eastern tent caterpillar]] regurgitates a droplet of digestive fluid to repel attacking ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peterson, Steven C., Nelson D. Johnson, and John L. LeGuyader|title=Defensive Regurgitation of Allelochemicals Derived From Host Cyanogenesis By Eastern Tent Caterpillars|jstor=1939211|doi=10.2307/1939211|journal=Ecology|volume= 68|issue=5 |year=1987|pages= 1268–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, larvae of the [[noctuid moth]] regurgitate when disturbed by ants. The vomit of noctuid moths has repellent and irritant properties that help to deter predator attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smedley, Scott R., Elizabeth Ehrhardt, and Thomas Eisner|title=Defensive Regurgitation by a Noctuid Moth Larva (''Litoprosopus futilis'')|journal=Psyche: A Journal of Entomology |volume=100|issue=3–4 |year=1993|pages=209–21|doi=10.1155/1993/67950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicidal altruism===
{{further information|Autothysis}}

An unusual type of predator deterrence is observed in the [[Camponotus saundersi|Malaysian exploding ant]]. Social [[hymenoptera]] rely on [[altruism]] to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony.&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Davidson, D.W. | title=A review on self-destructive defense behaviors in social insects | author2=Salim, K.A. | author3=Billen, J. | date=2011 | journal=Insectes Sociaux | volume=59 | pages=1–10 |doi=10.1007/s00040-011-0210-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied [[submandibular glands]],&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"/&gt; expelling corrosive irritant compounds and adhesives onto the predator. These prevent predation and serve as a signal to other enemy ants to stop predation of the rest of the colony.&lt;ref name=r1479&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jones | first1=T.H. | last2=Clark | first2=D.A. | last3=Edwards | first3=A. | last4=Davidson | first4=D.W. | last5=Spande | first5=T.F. | last6=Snelling | first6=R.R. | date=2004 | title=The chemistry of exploding ants, ''Camponotus'' spp. (''Cylindricus complex'') | journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume=30 | issue=8 | pages=1479–1492 | doi=10.1023/b:joec.0000042063.01424.28 | pmid=15537154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escaping==

===Flight===
The normal reaction of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding,&lt;ref name=Corlett&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corlett |first1=Richard T. |title=Tropical rain forests : an ecological and biogeographical comparison |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=2011 |isbn=978-1444332551 |pages=197, 200|edition=2nd |author2=Primack, Richard B. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R0j8NROHQi8C&amp;pg=PA197}}&lt;/ref&gt; falling, swimming, running, jumping, [[burrowing]]&lt;ref name=Bromley&gt;{{cite book|author=Bromley, Richard G. |title=Trace Fossils: Biology, Taxonomy and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_kqvIui4IkC&amp;pg=PA69 |year=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-07607-8 |pages=69–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Rotating locomotion in living systems#Rolling|rolling]],&lt;ref name="Krus"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kruszelnicki | first = Karl S. | title = Real Wheel Animals—Part Two | work = Great Moments in Science | publisher = ABC Science | date = August 9, 1999 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/1999/08/09/42510.htm?site=science/greatmomentsinscience | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161001195024/http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/1999/08/09/42510.htm?site=science%2Fgreatmomentsinscience | archivedate = October 1, 2016 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the animal's capabilities.{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=145–149}} Escape paths are often erratic, making it difficult for the predator to predict which way the prey will go next: for example, birds such as [[snipe]], [[ptarmigan]] and [[black-headed gull]]s evade fast raptors such as [[peregrine falcon]]s with zigzagging or jinking flight.{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=145–149}} In the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and gliding.&lt;ref name=Corlett/&gt; Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the [[animal echolocation|sonar clicks of bats]].{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=145–149}} Among fish, the [[Gasterosteus|stickleback]] follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating [[merganser]] duck.{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=145–149}}

===Autotomy===
{{main article|Autotomy}}
[[File:Lizard tail autotomy.JPG|thumb|[[Lizard]] tail [[autotomy]] can distract predators, continuing to writhe while the lizard makes its escape.]]

Some animals are capable of [[autotomy]] (self-amputation), shedding one of their own [[appendage]]s in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be [[regeneration (biology)|regenerated]] later. Certain [[sea slug]]s discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as [[crab]]s can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among [[vertebrate]]s, many [[gecko]]s and other [[lizard]]s shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving the lizard time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=179–181}}

==History of observations==

[[Aristotle]] recorded observations (around 350 BC) of the antipredator behaviour of [[cephalopod]]s in his ''[[History of Animals]]'', including the use of ink as a distraction, camouflage, and signalling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |title=The History of Animals |date=1910 |origyear=350 BC |volume=IX |pages=621b-622a |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.9.ix.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, [[Hugh Cott]] wrote a compendious study of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism, ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]''.{{sfn|Cott|1940}}

'''''Biser''''' was a [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] magazine, intended as a non-political replacement for the defunct ''[[Behar (magazine)|Behar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EB5pAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Muhamed+Bekir+Kalajd%C5%BEi%C4%87&amp;dq=Muhamed+Bekir+Kalajd%C5%BEi%C4%87|title=Anali Gazi Husrev-begove bibliotheke|publisher=|year=2001|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue was published 1 June 1912 out of [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] by 19-year-old publisher [[Muhamed Bekir Kalajdžić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bosnjaci.net/prilog.php?pid=41321|title=BISER, NA PRAGU STOTE GODIŠNJICE|publisher=Bosnjaci|date=5 April 2011|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main objective of ''Biser'' was to focus on [[Bosniak]] culture and heritage, as well as Muslim literary works. The Bosnian word ''biser'' means pearl in English.

Poet [[Musa Ćazim Ćatić]] served as editor in chief, often writing poems, essays, criticism, and translations of numerous studies and books for the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iGQMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Muhamed+Bekir+Kalajd%C5%BEi%C4%87&amp;dq=Muhamed+Bekir+Kalajd%C5%BEi%C4%87&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw146i1P3LAhXFOSYKHQIXCc4Q6AEIRDAG|title=Hercegovina, Volumes 15-16|publisher=|year=2003|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7JiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Muhamed+Bekir+Kalajd%C5%BEi%C4%87&amp;dq=Muhamed+Bekir+Kalajd%C5%BEi%C4%87&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi05Zje3P3LAhWB4CYKHdUjAtM4ChDoAQhaMAk|title=Biserje: antologija muslimanske književnosti|publisher=|year=1990|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXNBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Muhamed+Bekir+Kalajd%C5%BEi%C4%87&amp;dq=Muhamed+Bekir+Kalajd%C5%BEi%C4%87&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhp9Tk6P3LAhUIYyYKHbfaCqY4FBDoAQgiMAE|title=Musa Ćazim Ćatić: Studija|publisher=|year=1965|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, ''Biser'' halted production until 1918 when Kalajdžić began printing again in 1918 to avoid being drafted into the army. ''Biser'' ended its run in 1919.

'''Carl-Michael Edenborg''' (formerly surnamed ''Strömberg''), born 1967, is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer, critic, [[editor in chief|editor]], publisher and historian of ideas and literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=767&amp;artikel=3348685 Uppvaknadet – Eric Schüldt möter Carl-Michael Edenborg], [[Sveriges Radio]] 2010-01-05 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Edenborg has studied the history of [[alchemy]], and completed a PhD in the [[History of Ideas]] at [[Stockholm University]] in 2002 with a dissertation on alchemy in Sweden in the [[age of Enlightenment]], ''The shame of alchemy: expulsion of the alchemical tradition from the public sphere''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/8816710 LIBRIS record]&lt;/ref&gt; The work was awarded with the Paracelsus prize by the Swedish Paracelsus Society and was published in an extended second edition in 2004. He had previously touched on the subject in his biography of [[Gustaf Bonde (1682-1764)|Gustaf Bonde]], a Swedish 18th century statesman known for his political memoirs, who was also a pseudo-historian in the [[Olaus Rudbeck|Rudbeckian]] tradition and an alchemist, and in an article on another Swedish alchemist, [[Fabian Wilhelm af Ekenstam]], both from 1997. He teaches at [[Stockholm University]].

== Other intellectual activities ==
Edenborg was one of the founding members of the [[The Surrealist Group in Stockholm|Stockholm Surrealist Group]] in 1986 and published several books on its publishing company ''Surrealistförlaget''. During the 1990s he started his own publishing company, ''Vertigo'', which, among other things, has published a Swedish translation of [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''The Castle of Otranto'' ("Borgen i Otranto, 1996) in Paul Soares' translation. Edenborg has taken an interest in early pornography and other literature beyond the [[mainstream]] canon. He has written a short article in the bibliographic journal ''Biblis'' on "the first Swedish pornography". Vertigo has published the [[Marquis de Sade]] in Swedish translation, and a series of books called the "Classics of transgressions" (''Överträdelsens klassiker''), including works by [[Dennis Cooper]], [[Samuel_R._Delany]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Gabrielle Wittkop]], [[Pauline Réage]] and more in the same tradition.

In 2011, he co-wrote a graphic novel with his then wife, the illustrator [[Loka Kanarp]]: ''Hungerhuset''. It was translated to French: ''La Maison de la Faim'' by French editor [[Actes Sud]]. In 2012, Edenborg's novel ''Mitt grymma öde'' about the life of composer George Frideric [[Händel]] was published to some critical acclaim. In the same year he wrote a manifesto, ''Det parapornografiska manifestet'', which was published in the U.S. by [[Action books]] under the title ''The Parapornographic Manifesto''. Recently, he has revealed that he also wrote the novels and short stories that were published under the pseudonym [[Gunnar Blå]].

Edenborg works as a critic for the Swedish daily newspaper ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' and runs a café that was first located in [[Gamla Stan|Stockholm's Old Town]] but now is in [[Södermalm]].

}}'''Carlos Ibarguren Uriburu''' (April 18, 1877 &amp;ndash; April 3, 1956) was an Argentine academic, historian and politician. As a writer he was noted as one of the foremost academics of the history of Argentina as well as a leading expert on [[constitutional law]]. Politically he was initially associated with the [[liberalism|liberal]] tendency amongst the country's [[intelligentsia]] before moving to [[far right]] [[nationalism]] in later life.

==Early career==
Ibarguren was born on [[Salta]], in 1877. An academic by profession, Ibarguren was a professor of law at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], his alma mater.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/i/ibarguren.htm Carlos Ibarguren]&lt;/ref&gt; Recognised for his fine legal and constitutional mind from 1904 onwards he held several undersecretary positions within the government.&lt;ref name="carlos"&gt;[http://www.camdipsalta.gov.ar/INFSALTA/ibarguren.htm Carlos Ibarguren Uriburu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720014205/http://www.camdipsalta.gov.ar/INFSALTA/ibarguren.htm |date=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Utilising his experience [[Roque Sáenz Peña]] appointed him as justice minister during his administration of [[Roque Sáenz Peña]], a position he held until 1914.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

After this spell in office, Ibarguren continued as a supporter of the [[Radical Civic Union]] for a time.&lt;ref name="carlos"/&gt; However he became a founder of the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Argentina)|Democratic Progressive Party]] in 1914 and served as its vice-president whilst also drafting its programme. In this role he became a strong critic of the government of [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]].&lt;ref name="carlos"/&gt; He was an unsuccessful candidate in the [[Argentine legislative election, 1920|1920 legislative elections]], part of a list of intellectuals that included the likes of [[Lisandro de la Torre]] and [[Ezequiel Ramos Mexía]] but which failed to make an impact with the voters.&lt;ref name="carlos"/&gt; He was chosen as Democratic Progressive candidate for the [[Argentine presidential election, 1922|1922 presidential election]], although he managed only 7.7% of the vote.

==Move to the right==
Up to this point, Ibarguren had been associated with the [[liberalism]] that defined Argentina's cultural elite but the setbacks of 1920 saw his positions alter. His book of the same year, ''La literatura y la gran guerra'', demonstrated a shift to the [[nationalism]] that was to come to dominate his political thought.&lt;ref name="carlos"/&gt;  He argued that [[democracy]] left the door open to too many disparate groups and that it needed brakes which should be provided by a united [[conservatism|conservative]] [[right-wing politics|right]].&lt;ref&gt;David Rock, ''Authoritarian Argentina'', 1995, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; Politically Ibarguren grew interested in using the masses as a bulwark of reactionary activity and as such moved close to the ideas of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;David Rock, ''Authoritarian Argentina'', 1995, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1930 coup of Gen. [[José Félix Uriburu]], Ibarguren petitioned the new president to switch to [[corporatism]] and this economic model came to dominate his thinking until, under Ibarguren's advice, [[Juan Perón]] allowed the corporations to be represented in parliament in 1948.&lt;ref name="carlos"/&gt; Despite this however, Ibarguren held no formal positions within the governments of either Uriburu or Perón and largely concentrated on his academic pursuits. His last political role of note was as [[De facto Federal Interventor of Córdoba]] from 1930 to 1931, a post entrusted to him by Uriburu. Ibarguren died in [[Buenos Aires]], in 1956.

==Writing==
Ibarguren was especially noted for his work on the history of Argentina, with his most celebrated books being ''Juan Manuel de Rosas'' (1930), ''Las sociedades literarias y la revolución argentina'' (1938) and ''La historia que he vivido'' (1955).&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; He also served as president of the [[Argentine Academy of Letters]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

==Early years==

[[File:Horse 1910 photo.gif|thumb|1910 Flower Delivery Cart, Denver Colorado]]&lt;ref&gt;Photo courtesy of [http://www.dwfwholesale.com/ "DWF Wholesale Florist, Denver, CO"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, as the silver and gold mining days of [[Colorado]] were winding down, those who didn’t strike it rich were searching for ways to bring goods and services to the growing population of [[Denver]].  In 1872, Denver constructed an irrigation ditch that carried water from the [[Platte River Canyon]] into Denver.&lt;ref&gt;Shu Liu and Linda M. Meyer, [https://dspace.library.colostate.edu/bitstream/handle/10217/5199/Carnations_Liu_Meyer.pdf?sequence=1 "Carnations and the Floriculture Industry: Documenting the Cultivation and Marketing of Flowers in Colorado"], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; With this new source of consistent water, growers soon discovered the bright sunny days and virgin soils of Denver were ideal for growing vegetables and cut flowers.

Few varieties of [[Dianthus caryophyllus|carnations]] were available during those early days and competition was fierce. Many independent growers marketed their [[carnations]] through sales outlets in their greenhouses or by selling the mature flowers to retail florists. Growers had to contend with weather extremes that required either charcoal heaters in delivery wagons during winter so the flowers wouldn’t freeze or battling the often-intense summer heat when the crops could easily wilt. Nonetheless, business flourished. Floral arrangements featuring carnations were a common gift to the women of Denver's tenderloin district as well as high society.&lt;ref name="Kingman 1986 p14-15"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf# |title=Kingman, ''A History – Colorado Flower Growers and its People'' pages 14-15 |access-date=2015-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101812/http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first greenhouse in Denver was constructed in 1891. By 1900, the [[Floriculture|floral industry]] had approximately 400,000 square feet of greenhouse glass covering its nurseries.&lt;ref name="Kingman 1986 p12"&gt;[http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf Kingman, Dick (1986) ''A History – Colorado Flower Growers and its People''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101812/http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf# |date=2016-03-04 }} page 12 Colorado Greenhouse Growers Association, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Riverside Cemetery (Denver, Colorado)|Riverside Cemetery]] at 52nd and Brighton Blvd, Mauff Floral Company in the 1200 block of Logan St., established in 1880, [https://history.denverlibrary.org/east-colfax-neighborhood  Colfax Floral] at East Colfax and Josephine, [http://digital.denverlibrary.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15330coll22/id/33941 Park Floral] at 17th and York, and Curtis Park Floral at 34th and Downing were some of the first establishments dedicated to the public’s desire for carnations.&lt;ref name="Kingman 1986 p14"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf# |title=Kingman, ''A History – Colorado Flower Growers and its People'' page 14 |access-date=2015-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101812/http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVHZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Mauff+Floral+Company&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xeOaZ9gmZy&amp;sig=2NqdpfWTOXTUGxwGakCHjTqHIc4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjozceNz4HKAhWILmMKHUgkC30Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Mauff%20Floral%20Company&amp;f=false ''The American Florist Company's Directory of Florists, Nurserymen and Seedsmen of the United States and Canada'', 1910]&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado's Carnation Gold Rush had begun.

A marketing and grading system for carnations was established in the early 1900s. Swedish immigrant and founder of the [http://www.dwfwholesale.com/ Denver Wholesale Florist] s, N.A. Benson, recognized that Colorado carnations were a valuable commodity that could be marketed nationally. He was instrumental in standardizing prices and insisting on quality from all growers. Around that time, J. Edward Johnson, of the Pikes Peak Floral Company in [[Colorado Springs]] began shipping the prized Colorado carnations to neighboring states.&lt;ref name="Kingman 1986 p18"&gt;[http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf Kingman, ''History – Colorado Flower Growers and its People''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101812/http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf# |date=2016-03-04 }} page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later Years ==

In the fall of 1917, George Brenkert of Washington Park Floral entered his newly developed shell pink carnation called “Denver” in the [[Denver Society of Ornamental Horticulturists]]. While he didn’t win in that show, the “Denver” carnation attracted attention and later won a Bronze Medal in the 1921 National Flower Show in Washington, DC. Colorado was becoming known for its thriving carnation and cut flower business.&lt;ref name="Kingman 1986 p22"&gt;[http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf Kingman, ''A History – Colorado Flower Growers and its People''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101812/http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf# |date=2016-03-04 }}, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;[[President Harding|President Elect Harding]] wore a Colorado carnation in his lapel on his inauguration day. He was carrying on a tradition established by his predecessor, [[William McKinley|President William McKinley]]. McKinley always wore a red carnation in his lapel, and ordered fresh carnations to his office daily. McKinley’s birthday, January 29 is still recognized as the official Carnation Day.&lt;ref name="Kingman 1986 p25"&gt;[http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf Kingman, ''A History – Colorado Flower Growers and its People''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101812/http://ghex.colostate.edu/pdf_files/AHistoryColoradoFlowerGrowersAndItsPeople.pdf# |date=2016-03-04 }}, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1919, the 15th [[Census of the United States]] reported that the value of sales for floral crops in Colorado was $1,145,000.&lt;ref name="Kingman 1986 p25" /&gt;

From 1925 to 1927 greenhouse space used for plants and flowers more than doubled in the state of Colorado.

By 1926, Colorado produced an estimated 8,000,000 blooms of carnations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Colorado Year Book, 1927|last = Harlow|first = Harry T.|publisher = Colorado State Planning Division|year = 1927|isbn = |location = Denver, CO|pages = 134|chapter = Floriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1927, the floriculture industry in Colorado was shipping to 20 states. By that time, there were approximately 5,000,000 square feet of greenhouse glass on operating nurseries in Colorado.The demand for Colorado carnations was growing. Colorado was "rapidly becoming recognized as the carnation state", because of the excellent quality of the blooms and the fact that they could be produced year round. 1927 was the first year the floriculture industry of Colorado was recognized in the Colorado Year Book published by the [[Colorado State Planning Division]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Colorado Year Book, 1927|last = Harlow|first = Harry T.|publisher = Colorado State Planning Division|year = 1927|isbn = |location = Denver, CO|pages = 135|chapter = Floriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Colorado's production of Carnations reached 12,000,000 blooms. 10 states depended entirely on Colorado for their supplies of flowers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Colorado Year Book, 1928-1929|last = Harlow|first = Harry T.|publisher = Colorado State Planning Division|year = 1929|isbn = |location = Denver, CO|pages = 151|chapter = Floriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1929, there were 101 establishments, cultivating 1,582.463 square feet of carnation beds&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Colorado Year Book 1933 - 1934|last = |first = |publisher = Colorado State Planning Division|year = 1934|isbn = |location = Denver, CO|pages = 219|chapter = Floriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the annual gross income of the Colorado's Floral industry of approximately $5,000,000 topping the value of metallic gold mined that year in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado became famous throughout the country for carnations of "brilliant color, unusual size and lasting quality. " Colorado carnations made their way to New York, London and Cuba.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By 1931, Colorado was considered one of the most important states in the union for the productions of flowers including Carnation, [[Rose]]s, and Gypsophilia (Baby Breath).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Local greenhouses continued to prosper and be built, particularly in the northwest corner of Denver and its suburbs. [[Wheat Ridge, Colorado]] still celebrates an annual [http://www.thecarnationfestival.com/ Carnation Festival]. New varieties continued to be developed including the White Ward and Hilda Varieties.

The early Denver growers began an industry that would shape Colorado’s economy and landscape. They helped to establish an orderly system to provide quality cut flowers to the nation and beyond. Some of the Colorado family names associated with the Carnation Gold Rush are Amato, [[Elitch Gardens|Elitch]], Lambourn, [http://www.thinkflowers.com/ Lehrer], Maler, and Spano.

No nation has been targeted for as much editorial abuse from the worldwide media. No nation has been subjected to more frequent threats of annihilation. No nation has had more genocidal incitements directed against its citizens.  It is remarkable indeed that a democratic nation born in response to a decision of the United Nations should still not be accepted by so many countries, groups, and individuals. No other UN member is threatened with physical destruction by other member states so openly and with so little rebuke from the General Assembly or the Security Council. Indeed, no nation, regardless of its size or the number of deaths it has caused, has been condemned as often by the UN and its constituent bodies.

The [[government of Israel]] has been criticized for issues regarding [[Israeli settlements]] in the [[Palestinian territories]], its [[Human rights record of Israel in the Palestinian territories|treatment of Palestinian Arabs]], the conduct of [[Israeli Defense Forces]] during conflicts and the [[blockade of the Gaza Strip]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/27/david-cameron-gaza-prison-camp | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Nicholas | last1=Watt | first2=Harriet | last2=Sherwood | title=David Cameron: Israeli blockade has turned Gaza Strip into a 'prison camp' | date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Economy of the Palestinian territories|Palestinian territories]]. Other historic issues with ongoing consequences have also been criticized including: the [[Lausanne Conference, 1949|refusal to allow]] post-war [[Palestinian refugees]] to [[Right of return|return]] to their homes, and the [[Israeli-occupied territories|prolonged occupation of territories gained in war]] and the construction of settlements therein.

Israel's status as a representative democracy has also been questioned because Israeli residents of the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]] are allowed to vote in Israel's elections while Palestinian residents are not.&lt;ref name="Why Israel is Not a Democracy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=BARAT|first1=FRANK|title=Why Israel is Not a Democracy|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/04/01/why-israel-is-not-a-democracy/|accessdate=15 September 2014|quote="[[Ilan Pappé]]: No, Israel is definitely not a democracy. A country that occupies another people for more than 40 years and disallow them the most elementary civic and human rights cannot be a democracy. A country that pursues a discriminatory policy against a fifth of its Palestinian citizens inside the 67 borders cannot be a democracy. In fact Israel is, what we use to call in political science a [[Herrenvolk democracy]], its democracy only for the masters. The fact that you allow people to participate in the formal side of democracy, namely to vote or to be elected, is useless and meaningless if you don’t give them any share in the common good or in the common resources of the State, or if you discriminate against them despite the fact that you allow them to participate in the elections. On almost every level from official legislation through governmental practices, and social and cultural attitudes, Israel is only a democracy for one group, one ethnic group, that given the space that Israel now controls, is not even a majority group anymore, so I think that you’ll find it very hard to use any known definition of democracy which will be applicable for the Israeli case."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Is Israel a Democracy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorenberg|first1=Gershom|title=Is Israel a Democracy?|url=http://prospect.org/article/israel-democracy-0|publisher=The American Prospect|accessdate=20 September 2014|quote="Whether it ends the occupation and discrimination against Arab citizens within its borders will alter our perception of whether the nation began as an imperfect democracy or a false one.

One of the effects of international criticism has been the impact on social psychology of the Israeli Jewish public - according to a survey more than half of Israelis believe "the whole world is against us", and three quarters of Israelis believe "that no matter what Israel does or how far it goes towards resolving the conflict with the Palestinians, the world will continue to criticize Israel".&lt;ref name="peace index"/&gt;

Criticisms of Israeli policies come from several groups: primarily from [[Activism|activists]], within Israel and worldwide, the [[United Nations]] and other [[non-governmental organization]]s including European Churches, and mass media. [[Media bias]] is often claimed by both sides of the debate. Since 2003, the UN has issued 232 resolutions with respect to Israel, 40% of all resolutions issued by the UN over the period and more than six times that of the second placed country, [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="eyeontheunresolution"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Resolutions between 2003 and today by country|url=http://www.eyeontheun.org/browse-un.asp?ya=1&amp;sa=1&amp;ua=1&amp;s=0&amp;tp=1&amp;tpn=Resolution|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestinian refugees===

{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

Palestinian refugees are defined by the UN as [[Palestinians|Arabs]] who lived in Palestine for at least two years prior to 1948 and their descendants, and who fled or were expelled from their homes during and after the [[1948 Palestine War]].

The causes and responsibilities of the exodus are a matter of controversy among historians and commentators of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shlaim|Shlaim, Avi]], [http://ccas.georgetown.edu/research-articles.cfm?id=96 "The War of the Israeli Historians."] ''[[Center for Arab Studies]]'', 1 December 2003 (retrieved 17 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas historians now agree on most of the events of that period, there remains disagreement as to whether the exodus was the result of a [[Plan Dalet|plan]] designed before or during the war by [[Zionist]] leaders or was an unintended consequence of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris]], 1989, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949'', Cambridge University Press; [[Benny Morris]], 1991, ''1948 and after; Israel and the Palestinians'', Clarendon Press, Oxford; [[Walid Khalidi]], 1992, ''All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948'', Institute for Palestine Studies; [[Nur Masalha]], 1992, ''Expulsion of the Palestinians: The Concept of "Transfer" in Zionist Political Thought'', Institute for Palestine Studies; [[Efraim Karsh]], 1997, ''Fabricating Israeli History: The "New Historians"'', Cass; [[Benny Morris]], 2004, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', Cambridge University Press; [[Yoav Gelber]], 2006, ''Palestine 1948: War, Escape and the Palestinian Refugee Problem'', Oxford University Press; [[Ilan Pappé]], 2006, ''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine'', OneWorld&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}

Significant international pressure was placed on both sides during the [[Lausanne Conference, 1949|1949 Lausanne Conference]] to resolve the refugee crisis. The parties signed a joint protocol on the framework for a comprehensive peace, which included territories, refugees, and Jerusalem, in which Israel agreed "in principle" to allow the return of all of the Palestinian refugees.&lt;ref name=Pappe9&gt;{{cite book

|isbn = 1-85043-819-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}} According to [[New Historians|New Historian]] [[Ilan Pappe]], this Israeli agreement was made under pressure from the [[United States]], and because the Israelis wanted [[United Nations]] membership, which required Israeli agreement to allow the return of all refugees. Once Israel was admitted to the UN, it retreated from the protocol it had signed because it was completely satisfied with the status quo and saw no need to make any concessions with regard to the refugees or on boundary questions. This led to significant and sustained international criticism.&lt;ref name=Pappe9/&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}

====Allegations of ethnic cleansing====

"New Historian" [[Ilan Pappe]] argued in ''[[The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine]]'' that Israel's policy [[1948 Palestine war|between 1947 and 1949]], when "over 400 Palestinian villages were deliberately destroyed, civilians were massacred, and around a million men, women, and children were expelled from their homes at gunpoint" is best described as [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pappe|first1=Ilan|title=The ethnic cleansing of Palestine|date=2007|publisher=Oneworld|location=Oxford|isbn=1851685553|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="tnr.com"&gt;[[Benny Morris]].

For example, Israeli historian [[Benny Morris]] called Pappe "At best... one of the world’s sloppiest historians; at worst, one of the most dishonest." When asked about the [[1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle]], he responded "There are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing. I know that this term is completely negative in the discourse of the 21st century, but when the choice is between ethnic cleansing and genocide - the annihilation of your people - I prefer ethnic cleansing. [...] There was no choice but to expel that population. It was necessary to cleanse the hinterland and cleanse the border areas and cleanse the main roads. It was necessary to cleanse the villages from which our convoys and our settlements were fired on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shavit|first1=Ari|title=Survival of the Fittest (an interview with Historian Benny Morris)|url=http://www.deiryassin.org/bennymorris.html|publisher=Haaretz, Magazine Section, 9 January 2004|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also added in 2008, that ''"There was no Zionist "plan" or blanket policy of evicting the Arab population, or of "ethnic cleansing". Plan Dalet (Plan D), of 10 March 1948 ... was the master plan ... to counter the expected pan-Arab assault on the emergent Jewish state"''.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, "Benny Morris on fact, fiction, &amp; propaganda about 1948", ''The Irish Times'', 21 February 2008, https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/israel-and-the-palestinians-1.896017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation and annexation of neighboring territories===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
{{Main|Israeli-occupied territories|International law and the Arab–Israeli conflict}}
{{See also|Annexation}}
The territories occupied by [[Israel]] from [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]] after the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 have been designated as [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territory]] by the United Nations and many other international organisations, governments and others. They consist of the [[West Bank]] and much of the [[Golan Heights]]. From the Six-Day War until 1982, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] was occupied by Israel, but it was returned to Egypt in the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]]. The Gaza Strip was also occupied by Israel until its unilateral disengagement. UN Security Council resolution 242, emphasized "the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war," setting the stage for controversy on the legal status of areas captured in 1967, and in 1948. There are two interpretations of international law this matter:
The Israeli position is that:
* The wars in [[Suez Crisis|1956]] and [[Six-Day War|1967]] were waged by Israel to ensure the state's survival. As most hostilities were initiated by the Arab side, Israel had to fight and win these wars in order to ensure the state's sovereignty and safety. Territories captured in the course of those wars are therefore legitimately under Israeli administration for both security reasons and to deter hostile states from belligerence.
*In the absence of peace treaties between all the parties at war, Israel has under all circumstances the right to maintain control of the captured territories. Their ultimate disposition should be a result of peace treaties, and not a condition for them.  Even so, Israel asserts that:
**The [[Suez Crisis|1956 war]] was caused by a pattern of Egyptian belligerence against Israel, culminating with the nationalization of the [[Suez Canal]] and the blockage of the canal for Israeli traffic in violation of the [[Convention of Constantinople]] and other relevant treaties, in their view a clear ''casus belli'' (i.e., an act justifying war)
**The [[Six-Day War|1967 war]] was similarly caused by the closing of the [[Straits of Tiran]], the rejection of UN forces in the Sinai desert, and the redeployment of Egyptian forces. Jordan and Syria entered the war in spite of Israeli efforts to keep these frontiers peaceful.
**The [[Yom Kippur War|1973 war]] was a surprise attack against Israel by Syria and Egypt.
The Arab position is that:
*The 1956 war was a result of a conspiracy between France, the United Kingdom and Israel in violation of Egypt's sovereignty.  Egypt claimed several legal justifications for refusing Israel use of the Suez Canal, including the right of self-defence.
*The war in 1967 was an unprovoked act of aggression aimed at expanding the boundaries of Israel, and the territories captured during this war are illegally occupied.
*As a result, the territories must be ceded in order for peace to be achieved.

Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in 1980-1 by the [[Jerusalem Law]] and the [[Golan Heights Law]] has not been recognised by any other country.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[UN Security Council Resolution 497]] [http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/SC497.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Palestinian Authority]], the [[European Union|EU]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

International bodies such as the United Nations have condemned the [[Jerusalem Law]] as a violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] and therefore hold that the establishment of the city as Israel's capital is against international law.  Consequently, countries have established embassies to Israel's government outside of Jerusalem.

[[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israel unilaterally disengaged]] from Gaza in September 2005, and declared itself no longer to be in occupation of the Strip. This has been contested by the UN, which though not declaring Gaza "occupied" under the legal definition, has referred to Gaza under the nomenclature of "Occupied Palestinian Territories". Some groups do assert that Gaza is legally occupied.&lt;ref name="AI_briefing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/007/2009/en/ |title=Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: The conflict in Gaza: A briefing on applicable law, investigations and accountability |date=2009-01-19 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=2009-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isrlpa13698"&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/07/06/isrlpa13698.htm "Human Rights Council Special Session on the Occupied Palestinian Territories"] July 6, 2006; Human Rights Watch considers Gaza still occupied.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn2009-01-06"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/06/israel.gaza.occupation.question/index.html|title=Is Gaza 'occupied' territory?|last=Levs|first=Josh|date=2009-01-06|publisher=CNN |accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lack of democracy====
Despite the fact that Israeli security legislation for [[Palestinian territories]] does not state that military law applies only to Arab residents of the territories, and not to Jews or to Israeli citizens.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yakobson|first=Alexander|url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.670709|title=Try West Bank Settlers in Israeli Military Court - Just Like Palestinians|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=12 August 2014|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli citizens are governed by [[Israeli law]] whereas Palestinians are governed by military law.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shabi|first=Rachel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/12/law-in-these-parts-israel-palestine|title=The Israeli documentary putting military rule in Palestine on trial|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 November 2012|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Israeli individuals such as [[Avraham Burg]], [[Ilan Pappé]], [[Gershom Gorenberg]], [[David Remnick]], [[Oren Yiftachel]], and [[Miko Peled]] and organisations as Human Rights Watch, B'tselem, Peace Now and others have questioned Israel's status as a democracy. These questions focus on the lack of democracy in the Israeli-occupied territories, not Israel proper. Such criticisms are based on the belief that both Israeli citizens in settlements and Palestinians should be given the right to suffrage, considering the Palestinians are effectively under Israeli authority and thus should benefit from it. They share a concern that the occupation of the territories is not temporary, given the over forty-five year duration and the large and the permanent nature of the [[Israeli settlement]]s.&lt;ref name="Just World Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peled|first1=Miko|title=The general's son : journey of an Israeli in Palestine|date=2012|publisher=Just World Books|location=Charlottesville, Va.|isbn=978-1935982159}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Why Israel is Not a Democracy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Is Israel a Democracy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israeli-Occupied Territories"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burg|first1=Avraham|title=Israel’s Fading Democracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/opinion/sunday/israels-fading-democracy.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=29 September 2014|quote=It will not be possible to define Israel as a democracy when a Jewish minority rules over a Palestinian majority between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea — controlling millions of people without political rights or basic legal standing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=REMNICK|first1=DAVID|title=Threatened|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/12/threatened|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=9 October 2014|quote=“The dream of a Jewish and democratic state cannot be fulfilled with permanent occupation,” Obama has said.

===Israeli settlements===

The participating High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/5fldpj.htm point 12] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207175611/http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/5fldpj.htm |date=February 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; numerous UN resolutions, the [[International Court of Justice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf|title=paragraphs 95-101 and 120|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other instances have ruled that Israel's policy of establishing civilian settlements in territories considered occupied, including in [[East Jerusalem]], is illegal. Israel disputes the notion that the West Bank and in particular East Jerusalem are occupied under international law, though this view is dismissed internationally.

Israel's settlement policy has drawn harsh criticism from the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/10/AR2010031000683.html|title=Biden's rebuke on new housing comes as Israel seeks to reaffirm U.S. relations|first=Janine|last=Zacharia|date=11 March 2010|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu//uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/118727.pdf|title=Statement by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton on demolition and settlements in East Jerusalem (January 10, 2011)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in Israel}}
[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) has said Israel operates a "two-tier" judicial system in areas of the occupied [[Palestinian territories]] it administers, to an effect which provides preferential services, development, and benefits for Israelis living in settlements in the occupied territories while imposing harsh conditions on Palestinians and other non-Israeli citizens. In some cases Israel has acknowledged differential treatment of Palestinians and Israelis, such as having separate roads for both communities and operating checkpoints for Palestinians, asserting that the measures are necessary to protect Israelis from attacks by Palestinian armed groups. 
In 2011 the Israeli parliament passed a law criminalizing participation in boycotts of Israeli settlements. The law drew criticism from the EU, the United States and the [[Anti-Defamation League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=229252|title='EU worried 'Boycott Bill' will effect Israeli free speech' (Jerusalem Post, July 13, 2011)][http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/u-s-on-israeli-boycott-law-freedom-to-protest-is-a-basic-democratic-right-1.372884 U.S. on Israeli boycott law: Freedom to protest is a basic democratic right (Haaretz, July 12, 2011)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Imprisonments====
{{Main|Human rights in Israel#Treatment of prisoners}}
[[Amnesty International]] reported that in 2009 hundreds of Palestinians were detained and held incommunicado for extended periods of time by Israel. While most were later released without charge, hundreds were tried before military courts whose procedures often failed to meet international standards for fair trial. According to Amnesty, almost all Palestinian prisoners were held in  violation of international humanitarian law, which prohibits the transfer of detainees to the territory of the occupying power (i.e., Israel proper). It claimed that about 300 minors and 550 adults were held without charge or trial for more than a year.&lt;ref name=AMNESTY2009&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/israel-occupied-territories/report-2009|title=Countries|website=amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said Israel held thousands of Palestinians as prisoners, and called on Israel to release them. Ban said the release of political prisoners would "serve as a significant confidence-building measure" and boost prospects of peace in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37698&amp;Cr=palestin&amp;Cr1|title=Israel’s release of Palestinian political prisoners could boost peace prospects – Ban|date=7 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also Amnesty International has called on Israel to release political prisoners, saying "all political prisoners held without charge or trial should be tried in fair trials or immediately released".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=13419 ISRAEL/OCCUPIED TERRITORIES/PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY "Developing a human rights agenda for peace" (Amnesty, 26 March 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603062041/http://amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=13419 |date=2011-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel objects to releasing prisoners, many of whom have been convicted by Israeli courts for violent crimes such as murder {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}. However, several prisoner release deals have been conducted by Israel as a gesture in negotiations, many which involved the release of hundreds or more prisoners.

According to Amnesty International, [[Palestinian prisoners in Israel#Physical torture|methods of torture used by Israel on Palestinian prisoners]] include prolonged tying in painful stress positions, sleep deprivation and threats to harm detainees’ families. Beatings and other ill-treatment of detainees are common during and following arrest and during transfer from one location to another.&lt;ref name=AMNESTY2009 /&gt;

====Treatment of ethnic and religious minorities====
{{Main|Racism in Israel}}
Organizations such as Amnesty International, the [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] (ACRI), the Israeli government-appointed [[Or Commission]], and  the United States [[Department of State]]&lt;ref name="state.gov-2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41723.htm |title=Israel and the occupied territories |publisher=State.gov |date=2005-02-28 |accessdate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; have published reports that document racism and discrimination directed towards racial and ethnic groups in Israel.

According to a study commissioned by Israel's Courts administration and Israel Bar Association, Arab Israelis who have been charged with certain types of crime are more likely than their Jewish counterparts to be convicted, and once convicted they are more likely to be sent to prison. The study also found differences in lengths of prison sentences given, with the average prison sentence at nine and a half months for Jews and 14 months for Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5039052|title=Israeli Arabs More Likely to Be Convicted for Crimes Than Their Jewish Counterparts, Study Shows|date=2 August 2011|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rights groups have said that anti-discrimination employment laws in Israel are rarely enforced. A coalition of nine Israeli rights groups has opposed a practice under which companies can advertise their policy to hire only Jewish Israelis, and no Arab Israelis. Companies advertising under a "Hebrew labor" banner adhere to a segregated employment philosophy derived from a practice by Jewish immigrants in Palestine in the first half of the 20th century which was meant to strengthen emerging Israeli industry from British and Arab influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/middle-east/israels-rights-groups-condemn-jews-only-businesses|title=Israel's rights groups condemn 'Jews only' businesses (The National, Aug 10, 2011)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stagnating peace process===
In February 2011, Netanyahu called German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] to complain about Germany's vote in favor of a resolution at the United Nations Security Council to declare Israeli settlements to be illegal and she responded "How dare you!  You are the one who disappointed us. You haven't made a single step to advance peace."&lt;ref&gt;Ravid, Barak.

===Military practices===
====Human shield allegations====
The IDF acknowledged using the "Neighbor Procedure” or the “Early Warning Procedure”, in which the IDF would encourage a Palestinian acquaintance of a wanted man to try to convince him to surrender. This practice was criticized by some as using "[[human shield]]s", an allegation the IDF denied, saying that it never forced people into carrying out the Neighbor Procedure; and that Palestinians volunteered to prevent excess loss of life.

The Israeli  group [[B'Tselem]] also made the comparison, saying that "for a long period of time following the outbreak of the second intifada [[Operation Defensive Shield]], in April 2002, the IDF systematically used Palestinian civilians as human shields, forcing them to carry out military actions which threatened their lives".&lt;ref name="B'Tselem"&gt;[[B'Tselem]], "[http://www.btselem.org/english/Human_Shields/20060720_Human_Shields_in_Beit_Hanun.asp 20 July 2006: Israeli Soldiers use civilians as Human Shields in Beit Hanun]", July 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Neighbor Procedure was outlawed by the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] in 2005 but some groups say the IDF continues to use it, although they say the number of instances has dropped sharply.&lt;ref name="B'Tselem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;"[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/11/world/main2674604.shtml Israel Probes "Human Shield" Allegations]", [[CBS News]], 11 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Possession of weapons of mass destruction====
{{Main|Nuclear weapons and Israel}}

Israel is seen to possess a nuclear arsenal of about 150 weapons, and Israel has been criticised for maintaining nuclear weapons and for not agreeing to a nuclear-free Middle East zone. In September 2009, the [[IAEA]] passed a resolution that "expresses concern about the Israeli nuclear capabilities, and calls upon Israel to accede to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]] and place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA safeguards..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6103398.stm|title=Q&amp;A: Nuclear disarmament|date=29 May 2010|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel has signed the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] but not ratified it, citing neighbouring states that have not done so either.&lt;ref name=ARMSCONTROLASSOCIATION&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/cbwprolif|title=Chemical and Biological Weapons Status at a Glance - Arms Control Association|website=armscontrol.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel is widely believed to have chemical weapons but officials have never directly admitted it, although in 1990 Science Minister Yuval Neeman threatened to retaliate against an Iraqi chemical-weapons strike "with the same merchandise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/28/world/israeli-sees-chemical-option-against-iraqis.html|title=Israeli Sees Chemical Option Against Iraqis|first=|last=AP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has not signed the [[Biological Weapons Convention]].&lt;ref name=ARMSCONTROLASSOCIATION /&gt;

====Targeted killings of terrorists====
{{Main|Israeli targeted killings}}
Amnesty International has condemned Israel's policy of assassinations targeting individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/MDE15/056/2003/en/ ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES: ISRAEL MUST PUT AN IMMEDIATE END TO THE POLICY AND PRACTICE OF ASSASSINATIONS (Amnesty, 3 July 2003)] "Amnesty International calls for an immediate end to the policy and practice of assassinations. For many years the Israeli army and security services have pursued a policy of extrajudicially executing Palestinians, without offering any proof of guilt and no right of defence. The pursuit of this policy has also resulted in the unlawful killing of scores and injury of hundreds of bystanders, including children"&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli officials have admitted that the policy exists and is being pursued, saying it helps prevent acts of terrorism from being committed against Israel. The [[targeted killing#North America|United States]]  has a very similar policy.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Criticism against has been raised also from some on the Israeli left, who say assassination policy is "gangster behavior" unbecoming of a government and is against Israeli law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1258187.stm|title=Israel's 'assassination policy'|date=1 August 2001|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel's Supreme Court has ruled that assassinations are illegal, but leaked documents suggest that Israel's army has ignored the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israeli-soldier-faces-jail-for-passing-secrets-to-reporter-2206362.html|title=Israeli soldier faces jail for passing secrets to reporter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaization of Jerusalem===
{{Main|Judaization of Jerusalem}}
The term ''Judaization of Jerusalem'' refers to the view that [[Israel]] has sought to transform the physical and demographic landscape of [[Jerusalem]] to correspond with a vision of a united and fundamentally [[Jew]]ish Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty.&lt;ref name=Zink&gt;{{Citation|title=A quiet transfer: the Judaization of Jerusalem|author=Valerie Zink|journal=Contemporary Arab Affairs|volume= 2| issue = 1|date=January 2009|pages=122–133|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a908133056~db=all~jumptype=rss|doi=10.1080/17550910802576148}}This definition is drawn largely from Valerie Zink's, and is supported, among others, by that of Hassassian in Ginat et al., who defines the Judaization of Jerusalem as "impos[ing] a Jewish landscape both physically and demographically."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has criticised Israel's efforts to change the demographic makeup of Jerusalem in several resolutions. All legislative and administrative measures taken by Israel, which have altered or aimed to alter the character, legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem, are described by the UN as "null and void" and having "no validity whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/depts/dpi/palestine/ch12.pdf|title=THE STATUS OF JERUSALEM (Chapter 12) (UN)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Falk]], an investigator with the U.N. Human Rights Council, said that Israel's expansion of East Jerusalem settlements and evictions of Palestinian residents can "only be described in its cumulative impact as a form of [[ethnic cleansing]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=54972|title=Inter Press Service - News and Views from the Global South|website=ipsnews.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 report, [[John Dugard]], independent investigator for the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], cites the Judaization of Jerusalem among many examples of Israeli policies "of [[colonialism]], [[Israeli apartheid|apartheid]] or [[Occupation of Palestine|occupation]]" that create a context in which [[Palestinian terrorism]] is "an inevitable consequence".&lt;ref name=IHT&gt;{{Citation|title=UN expert calls Palestinian terrorism 'inevitable consequence' of Israeli occupation|author=The Associated Press|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=26 February 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/26/news/UN-GEN-UN-Israel.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Law of Return===
Israel has enacted a [[Law of Return]] that allows Jews a fast-track to Israeli citizenship. [[Palestinian refugee]]s cannot apply for Israeli citizenship under the law since they are not Jewish, though they can apply for Israeli citizenship through the conventional channel. The law has drawn criticism from the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies which says the law is a "main example of Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian Arabs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/d96d50d790ad4a47c1256b760047dac7?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=unhchr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] says the contrast between the Law of Return and Israeli opposition to the [[Palestinian right of return|right of return]] of Palestinian refugees exhibits "barefaced racism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adc.org/issue_papers/ror/issuepaper30.PDF THE PALESTINIAN RIGHT OF RETURN (ADC issue paper 30, 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713154515/http://www.adc.org/issue_papers/ror/issuepaper30.PDF |date=2010-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,000 American Jews have backed a campaign entitled “Breaking the Law of Return”, saying the Law of Return creates an ethnically exclusive citizenship, which they see as unjust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/136153|title=Left-Wing US Jews Call ’Law of Return’ Racist|website=Israel National News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics claim that the guaranteed right for Jews to immigrate to Israel is discriminatory to non-Jews and therefore runs counter to the democratic value of equality under the law.&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;{{cite news |last=Omer-Man|first=Michael|url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/This-Week-in-History-Jewish-right-to-aliya-becomes-law|title=This Week in History: Jewish right to aliya becomes law|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Israel, Palestine, and the United Nations|List of United Nations resolutions concerning Israel}}
The UN has issued 232 resolutions with respect to Israel since 2003, representing 40% of all resolutions issued by the UN over the period and more than six times that of the second placed country, [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="eyeontheunresolution"/&gt;

According to testimony by the pro-Israel human rights NGO [[UN Watch]] to the [[United States Congress]] in January 2011 with respect to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], Israel has been the focus of 70% of approximately 50 condemnatory resolutions by the council, 60% of the ten Special Sessions of the council and 100% of the council's five fact-finding missions or inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&amp;b=1313923&amp;ct=9085393|title=UN Watch Testifies Before U.S. Congress on "The State of Human Rights at the U.N."|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analogies==
===Accusations of apartheid===
{{Main|Israel and the apartheid analogy}}

Comparisons between apartheid South Africa and Israel are increasingly made. Israelis recoil at the analogy, but the parallel is widely drawn in international circles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/689d27cc-7a98-11e2-9cc2-00144feabdc0.html Settler policy imperils Israel’s foundations, Financial Times, Feb. 21st, 2013]: "Faced with widely drawn international parallels between the West Bank and the Bantustans of apartheid South Africa, senior figures in Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party have begun to admit the danger."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/06/southafrica.israel|title=Worlds apart|first=Chris|last=McGreal|date=6 February 2006|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]], a group in Israel with support from several EU states, asserted in 2008 that the separate road networks in the West Bank for Israelis and Palestinians, the expansion of Jewish settlements, restriction of the growth of Palestinian towns and discriminatory granting of services, budgets and access to natural resources are "a blatant violation of the principle of equality and in many ways reminiscent of the Apartheid regime in South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/civil-rights-group-claim-israeli-occupation-is-reminiscent-of-apartheid-1056546.html|title=Civil rights group claim Israeli occupation is "reminiscent of apartheid" (The Independent, Dec. 7, 2008)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel has also been accused of apartheid by Michael Ben-Yair, Israel's attorney-general from 1993 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ben |first=Michael |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=136433 |title=The war's seventh day – Haaretz Daily Newspaper &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shulamit Aloni]], who served as Minister for Education under [[Yitzhak Rabin]].&lt;ref name="English translation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3346283,00.html|title=אכן כן, אפרטהייד בישראל|first=שולמית|last=אלוני|date=31 December 2006|publisher=|via=Ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparisons with Nazi Germany===
Some key aspects of Israeli society are sometimes compared to [[Nazi Germany]], directly or by allusion. Examples include: equating the [[Gaza Strip]] with [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps in Nazi-occupied Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukmediawatch.org/2014/07/12/london-protesters-compare-gaza-to-auschwitz-outside-israeli-embassy/|title=London protesters compare Gaza to Auschwitz outside Israeli Embassy|date=12 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|borderline RS - better to use a secondary source|date=July 2018}} [[Ariel Sharon]] with [[Joseph Goebbels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/23792/campus-war-against-israel-and-jews-joseph-massad-jamie-glazov|title=The Campus War Against Israel and the Jews: Joseph Massad - by DiscoverTheNetworks.org|date=1 October 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|borderline RS - better to use a more neutral source|date=July 2018}} and equating the idea of [[Jews as the chosen people]] with Nazi idea of the [[Master Race]].&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/chosen_people.html|title=The "Chosen People"|website=jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IHRA Working Definition on Antisemitism consider such comparisons as antisemitic.

Following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the Soviet Union compared Israeli tactics to those of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Druks, Herbert, ''The Uncertain Alliance: The U.S. and Israel from Kennedy to the Peace Process'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar comparison was made by the Israeli Arab author Nimer Nimer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Gordis|Gordis, Daniel]], ''Saving Israel: How the Jewish People Can Win a War That May Never End'', John Wiley and Sons, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]], one of Israel’s most prominent and acclaimed public intellectuals, philosophers, and scientist, and an Orthodox Jew, warned in 1982 that if the occupation continued, Israel would be in danger of succumbing to “Judeo-Nazism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/the-mengele-squad-1.316622 Haaretz]: "Prof. Yeshayahu Leibowitz's famous comment at the beginning of the First Lebanon War about "phenomena of Judeo-Nazism" as the inevitable consequences of an "occupation regime," stirred a furor in Israel. There are some things you must not say aloud, or even think to yourself. This was in 1982. The occupation was 15 years old and Leibowitz, in his sharp voice, was shouting what few others were saying here – if they did, it was in a whisper, and never, heaven forbid, in the army itself."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, author Israel Stockman-Shomron noted Nazi allusions in articles critical of Israel in publications including ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stockman-Shomron, Israel, ''Israel, the Middle East, and the Great Powers'',  Transaction Publishers, 1984, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples since the [[Second Intifada]] include:
*In 2000, [[Nur Masalha]] characterized Israel's occupation of Palestine territories as comparable to the Nazi [[Lebensraum]] (''living space'') policy of gaining land and materials for the benefit of Germans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nur Masalha|Masalha, Nur]], ''Imperial Israel and the Palestinians: the politics of expansion'',  p.&amp;nbsp;80&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In 2002, Portuguese Nobel Prize-winning author [[Jose Saramago]] compared conditions in [[Ramallah]] to concentration camps and, in conversation with a journalist, commented that the gas-chambers would "be here before long".&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', May 24, 2002, cited in Bruckner p.71; also discussed in Soyinka, Wole, '' Climate of fear: the quest for dignity in a dehumanized world'', Random House, Inc., 2005, p.109, Rosenbaum, pp.18-19, Berman, Paul, ''Terror and liberalism'',  pp.139-140&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In 2004, writer Josie Sandercock described Gaza as the "largest concentration camp in the world".&lt;ref&gt;* Sandercock, Josie, ''Peace under fire: Israel/Palestine and the International Solidarity Movement'', Verso, 2004, pp.209-231.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Chilean author [[Luis Sepulveda]] wrote: "In Auschwitz and Mauthausen, in Sabra, Shatila, and Gaza, Zionism and Nazism go hand in hand".&lt;ref&gt;''Une sale historie [Paris: Anne-Marie Metailie 2005] p.44, cited in Bruckner, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2009, British [[Member of Parliament]] [[Gerald Kaufman]] suggested that an Israeli justification for the deaths of 1,000 Palestinians on the grounds that "500 of them were militants" represented "the reply of a Nazi", and that the same logic could have been applied in the Warsaw Ghetto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vardi |first=Daphna |url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/01/16/1002308/mp-kaufman-likens-israelis-to-nazis |title=MP Kaufman likens Israelis to Nazis &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2009-01-16 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In 2009, Professor [[William I.

In May 2018, [[Jewish Voice for Labour]] and Free Speech on Israel produced a definition of antisemitism. In notes posted on the Jewish Voice for Labour website they argued that comparing Israel's actions to those of the Nazis should not automatically be seen as antisemitic: "Drawing such parallels can undoubtedly cause offence, but potent historical events and experiences are always key reference points in political debate. Whether such comparisons are anti-Semitic must be judged on their substantive content, and on the inferences that can reasonably be drawn about the motivation for making them, rather than on the likely degree of offence caused."&lt;ref name="jewishnews1"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/jewish-voice-for-labour-offer-new-anti-semitism-definition/|title=Jewish Voice for Labour offer new anti-Semitism definition|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Jewish News]]''|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, JVL contributed to the consultation on Labour's new code of conduct rejecting suggestions that comparisons between Israel and "features of pre-war [[Nazi Germany]]" or [[apartheid]]-era South Africa were "inherently antisemitic", and that "Such comparisons are only anti-Semitic if they show prejudice, hostility or hatred against Jews as Jews."&lt;ref name="jewishnews2"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/expelled-activist-tells-jvl-meeting-that-witchhunt-is-plot-to-topple-corbyn/|title=Expelled activist tells JVL meeting that ‘witchhunt’ is plot to ‘topple’ Corbyn|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Jewish News]]''|date=25 September 2018|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Some criticisms of Israel or Israeli policies have been characterized as anti-Semitic.   Proponents of the concept of New Antisemitism, such as [[Phyllis Chesler]], [[Gabriel Schoenfeld]] and [[Mortimer Zuckerman]], argue that, since the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], many criticisms of Israel are veiled attacks on Jews and hence are essentially antisemitic.  [[Abba Eban]], [[Robert S. Wistrich]], and [[Joschka Fischer]] focus on criticism of Zionism, and contend that some forms of anti-Zionism, particularly attacks on Israel's right to exist, are anti-Semitic in nature.

Critics of this view often portray this view as an "equation" of criticism with anti-Semitism.  Some critics of Israel or Israeli policies, including  [[Ralph Nader]], [[Jenny Tonge]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[Desmond Tutu]] suggest that equating criticism of Israel with antisemitism is inappropriate or inaccurate.  Other critics, such as [[John Mearsheimer]],  [[Alexander Cockburn]], [[Norman Finkelstein]], and [[William I. Robinson]], claim that supporters of Israel sometimes equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism in a deliberate attempt to prevent legitimate criticism of Israel and discredit critics.

However, proponents of the view usually argue that the equation of criticism with antisemitism is rarely made.  For example, [[Alvin H. Rosenfeld]] considers this argument to be disingenuous, dismissing it as "the ubiquitous rubric 'criticism of Israel,'" He states that "vigorous discussion of Israeli policy and actions is not in question," but rather statements that go well beyond legitimate criticism "and call into question Israel's right to continued existence." &lt;ref name="Rosenfeld"&gt;Alvin H. Rosenfeld, "Rhetorical Violence and the Jews," The New Republic, February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alan Dershowitz]] claims that some enemies of Israel pretend to be victimized by accusations of anti-Semitism, in order to garner support for their position.

[[Dina Porat]] (head of the [[Stephen Roth Institute|Institute for Study of Anti-semitism and Racism]] at [[Tel-Aviv University]]) characterizes some anti-Zionist ideals as anti-Semitic, because they amount to singling-out Jews for special treatment, while all other comparable groups of people are entitled to create and maintain a homeland.  She contends that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitic because it is discriminatory: "...antisemitism is involved when the belief is articulated that of all the peoples on the globe (including the [[Palestinians]]), only the Jews should not have the right to self-determination in a land of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Dina Porat, ''Defining Anti-Semitism'', http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/porat.htm#_edn23 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403165405/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/porat.htm |date=2008-04-03 }} accessed 15 November 2008   See also [[Emanuele Ottolenghi]] https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/29/comment&lt;/ref&gt;  Hannah Rosenthal of the United States State Department said UN double standards against Israel constitute "profound anti-semitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=170435|title=US anti-Semitism envoy slams UN ‘double standards’ on Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many commentators have suggested singling out Israel for disproportionate criticism is warranted as a result of Israel's actions.&lt;ref name="Neumann"&gt;{{cite book | first= Michael| last= Neumann| authorlink= Michael Neumann|year= 2006 | title= The Case Against Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="Ian Buruma"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/is-israel-a-normal-country-1.300934|title= Is Israel a normal country?|author= Ian Buruma|authorlink=Ian Buruma|date= July 2010|publisher= [[Haaretz]]|accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edward C.

===Distinguishing legitimate criticism of Israel from antisemitism===
The   European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) prepared a report in 2003 that distinguished criticism of Israel from anti-Semitism by testing whether "Israel is seen as being a representative of 'the Jew'":  if the speaker is considering Israel as a representative of Jews in general, then anti-Semitism is deemed to be underlying the criticism.&lt;ref&gt;
"Manifestations of Antisemitism in the EU 2002-2003", European Montoring Centre on Racisma and Xenophobia (EUMC), 2003, [http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/AS-Main-report.pdf online], pp 13, 240:
:"ARE ANTI-ISRAELI AND ANTI-ZIONIST EXPRESSIONS ANTISEMITIC?   If we turn to the crucial question of defining the point where anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist expressions are to be considered as antisemitism, then we could conclude, on the basis of our definition of antisemitism, that anti-Israeli or anti-Zionist attitudes and expression are antisemitic in those cases where Israel is seen as being a representative of “the Jew”, i.e. as a representative of the traits attributed to the antisemitic construction of “the Jew”.  But what if the opposite is the case and Jews are perceived as representatives of Israel? What if Jews are criticised or offended for Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians? If we stick to our definition, then, strictly speaking, we would have to qualify hostility towards Jews as “Israelis” only then as antisemitic, if it is based on an underlying perception of Israel as “the Jew”. If this is not the case, then we would have to consider hostility towards Jews as “Israelis” as not antisemitic, because this hostility is not based on the antisemitic stereotyping of Jews...  What should not be considered as antisemitic and therefore does not have to be monitored under the heading of “antisemitism”, is hostility towards Israel as “Israel”, i.e. as a country that is criticised for its concrete policies. Hostility towards Israel as “Israel” (as opposed to criticism of Israel as representative of the stereotypical “Jew”) should only then become a matter of general public concern, when there is explicit evidence that criticism of Israel as “Israel” produces attacks on Jews as either “the Jew” or “Israeli”. If there is no such evidence, the case of criticism and hostility towards Israel as “Israel” should not be part of monitoring activities under the heading of “antisemitism”.
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|3D Test of Antisemitism}}
[[Natan Sharansky]], former [[Soviet dissident]] and Israeli Minister, suggested a three-part test to distinguish legitimate criticism of Israel from anti-Semitic attacks.    Sharansky's tests that identify a criticism as anti-Semitic are:&lt;ref&gt;
*Sharansky, Natan, "3D Test of Anti-Semitism:  Demonization, Double Standards, Delegitimization", in ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 16:3-4 (Fall 2004), [http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-sharansky-f04.htm online]
* See also: ''Congressional record of the 108th congress, Second session'', volume 150, part 14, September 15, 2004 to September 28, 2004, page 18505:
:"[Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota speaking]  Natan Sharansky … has talked about three ways to determine whether criticism of Israel rises to the level of anti-Semitism. He talks about the three Ds"  Demonization, double standards, and delegitimization.  Demonization - when Israeli actions are blown so far out of proportion that the account paints Israel as the embodiment of all evil;  Double Standards - when Israel is criticized soundly for thing any other government would be viewed as justified in doing, like protecting its citizens from terrorism.  Delegitimization: a denial or Israel's right to exist or the right of the Jewish people to live securely in a homeland."
&lt;/ref&gt;
#Demonization - when Israeli actions are blown so far out of proportion that the account paints Israel as the embodiment of all evil.
#Double Standards - when Israel is criticized soundly for an action or policy that any other government would be viewed as justified in doing, like protecting its citizens from terrorism.
#Delegitimization: a denial of Israel's right to exist or the right of the Jewish people to live securely in a homeland.

Demonization and double standards are often used as evidence of anti-Semitism in relation to criticism of Israel. Sharansky believes that some criticisms involve applying an especially high moral standard to Israel, higher than applied to other countries (particularly compared to surrounding countries), yet the only special characteristic of Israel is that it is a Jewish state, hence there is an element of anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;Sharansky, Natan, "3D Test of Anti-Semitism:  Demonization, Double Standards, Delegitimization", in ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 16:3-4 (Fall 2004), [http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-sharansky-f04.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegitimization was a factor addressed by [[Abba Eban]], who claimed that efforts to deny "the equal rights of the Jewish people its lawful sovereignty within the community of nations" constituted anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;
Quoted by [[Oliver Kamm]], "Chomsky, antisemitism and intellectual standards",  [http://oliverkamm.typepad.com/blog/2005/02/chomsky_antisem.html]:
:Kamm quotes Eban: "There is no difference whatever between anti-Semitism and the denial of Israel's statehood. Classical anti-Semitism denies the equal right of Jews as citizens within society. Anti-Zionism denies the equal rights of the Jewish people its lawful sovereignty within the community of nations. The common principle in the two cases is discrimination". (New York Times, November 3, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union 2006 report on antisemitism ===
The  [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] (EUMC, recently renamed to [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]) published a draft of an [[operational definition]] of [[antisemitism]]  called ''[[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|Working Definition of Antisemitism]]''&lt;ref name="Working Definition of Antisemitism"&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Working Definition of Antisemitism

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which accompanied a report by the EUMC on report that summarized antisemitism in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;EUMC report&lt;/ref&gt;  The EUMC working definition included five kinds of behaviors related to criticism of Israel that might be manifestations of antisemitism:&lt;ref name="Working Definition of Antisemitism"/&gt;
# Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.
# Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.
# Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.
# Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.
# Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

This part of the definition has proved highly contentious and is seen by many as attempting to proscribe legitimate criticism of the human rights record of the Israeli Government by attempting to bring any criticism of Israel into the category of antisemitism, and as not sufficiently distinguishing between criticism of Israeli actions and criticism of Zionism as a political ideology, on the one hand, and racially based violence towards, discrimination against, or abuse of, Jews.&lt;ref&gt;

Paul Igansky points out that one of the EUMC anti-Semitic behaviors, comparisons between Israeli policy and those of the Nazis, is "arguably not intrinsically antisemitic", and that the context in which they are made is critical. Igansky illustrates this with the incident where Israeli prime minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] was described by fellow Jewish Israelis as cooperating with the Nazis, and depicted wearing an [[SS]] uniform. According to Igansky, the "Nazi" label was merely used as "charged political rhetoric" in this case.&lt;ref name="Perry2009"&gt;Igansky, Paul, "Conceptualizing Anti-Jewish Hate Crime", in ''Hate Crimes'', [[Barbara A. Perry]] (Ed.),  Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009, pp 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

===EISCA 2009 report on criticism of Israel===
Following the 2006 EUMC  report, the [[European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism]] (EISCA) published a report in 2009 entitled ''Understanding and Addressing the ‘Nazi Card' - Intervening Against Antisemitic Discourse'' which discussed comparisons of Israel with Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Ignasky, EISCA Report.  A brief excerpt from the report's introduction, p. 4:
:"Playing the ‘Nazi card’ is a discursive act involving the use of Nazi or related terms or symbols (Nazism, Hitler, swastikas, etc.) in reference to Jews, Israel, Zionism or aspects of the Jewish experience. It manifests in words uttered in speech or in writing, or in visual representations such as artwork, drawings, caricatures, cartoons, graffiti, daubings and scratchings, or visual expressions such as a Nazi salute or the clicking of heels.  In many instances, the playing of the Nazi card is unquestionably antisemitic. However, the inclusion of particular modes of criticism of Israel in definitions of antisemitism has provoked controversy. The result has been a war of words which has stagnated into an intellectual and discursive cul-de-sac of claim and counter-claim about what does and does not qualify as antisemitism….  One of the most challenging components of antisemitic discourse in general, and the discursive theme of the Nazi card in particular, concerns the problem of when the Nazi card is played against Israel and its founding movement, Zionism. In this case playing the Nazi card involves equating the Israeli state collectively, or the state embodied by its leaders or its military practices, with Nazis, Nazi Germany, and the genocidal actions of the Nazi regime…."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 report incorporated from the 2006 report the five specific kinds of criticism of Israel that should be considered as anti-Semitism (see above for a list of the five).&lt;ref&gt;EISCA report, p 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The report does not say all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic:  "Abhorrence and protest against the policies, practices, and leaders of the Israeli state can be expressed in numerous forceful and trenchant ways, as they could against any other state - none of which would be antisemitic…",&lt;ref&gt;EISCA report, p 24&lt;/ref&gt; and "Drawing attention to the consequent harms in [playing the Nazi card against Israel] should not be intended, or taken, in any way as an attempt to suppress criticism of Israel and its military practices."&lt;ref&gt;EISCA report, p 32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antony Lerman]] criticized the report, and suggested that it could be used to suppress legitimate criticism of Israel, and suggests that the report's authors do not adequately address that possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Lerman ''Should we ban ..":
:"While much of the [report's] definition [of anti-Semitism relating to criticism of Israel] is unexceptionable, it cites five ways in which antisemitism could be seen to "manifest itself with regard to the state of Israel taking into account the overall context".  One of these – "using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism... to characterize Israel or Israelis" – is fully justified. The other four are contentious: "Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination";  "Applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation";  "Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis"; "Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel".  None of these four are self-evidently antisemitic. But all could be used to justify labeling legitimate criticism of Israel as antisemitic. So the authors' approval of them makes their claim that "Drawing attention to the consequent harms in [playing the Nazi card against Israel] should not be intended, or taken, in any way as an attempt to suppress criticism of Israel and its military practices" both naïve and flimsy."
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objections to characterizing criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism===
Some commentators have objected to the characterization of criticisms of Israel as anti-Semitic, and have often asserted that supporters of Israel equate criticism with anti-Semitism or excessively blur the distinction between the two.   Examples include [[Michael Prior (theologian)|Michael P. Prior]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Norman Finkelstein]], [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]], [[Antony Lerman]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Jenny Tonge]], [[Ken Livingstone]], and [[Desmond Tutu]].    They provide a variety of reasons for their objections, including stifling free expression, promoting anti-Semitism, diluting genuine anti-Semitism, and alienating Jews from Judaism or Israel.

====Vague and indiscriminate====
[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]] claims that the American Jewish community regularly tries to blur the distinction between legitimate criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism, and says it is a "slippery slope" to expand the definition of anti-Semitism to include legitimate criticism of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner:
:"The New York Times reported on January 31 [Patricia Cohen, "Essay Linking Liberal Jews and Anti_Semitism Sparks a Furor", 2007] about the most recent attempt by the American Jewish community to conflate intense criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. In a neat little example of slippery slope, the report on 'Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism,' written by [[Alvin H. Rosenfeld]] [and published by American Jewish Committee in 2006], moves from exposing the actual anti-Semitism of those who deny Israel's right to exist—and hence deny to the Jewish people the same right to national self-determination that they grant to every other people on the planet—to those who powerfully and consistently attack Israel's policies toward Palestinians, see Israel as racist the way that it treats Israeli-Arabs (or even Sephardic Jews), or who analogize Israel's policies to those of apartheid as instituted by South Africa."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy professor Irfan Khawaja asserts that it is a "false equation" to equate anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, writing "The point is not that the charge of 'anti-Semitism' should never be made: some people deserve it…. But the equation of anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism is a farce that has gone on long enough, and it’s time that those who saw through the farce said so…"&lt;ref&gt;Khawaja, Irfan, "Poisoning the Well: The False Equation of Anti-Zionism and Anti-Semitism", ''History News Network'', [http://hnn.us/articles/10866.html online], 28 March 2005:
:"… [[Gabriel Schoenfeld|Schoenfeld]] takes umbrage at questions about the power of “the Jewish lobby,” and construes the asking of such questions as evidence of anti-Semitism. In some cases, he thinks that a particular criticism of Israel is overwrought, and takes its being overwrought as evidence of anti-Semitism. In some cases the claim is that a Jewish author is self-hating, which becomes evidence of anti-Semitism. In some cases we are told that a person draws attention to his Jewish friends while criticizing Israel, which only proves that the person wishes to be insulated from charges of anti-Semitism—which proves, in advance of any actual accusation, that he must be an anti-Semite.... The point is not that the charge of “anti-Semitism” should never be made: some people deserve it. Nor must it always be made with trepidation: some people obviously deserve it. Nor must anti-Zionists be thought immune to the charge: too many of them are guilty.... But the equation of anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism is a farce that has gone on long enough, and it’s time that those who saw through the farce said so—at length, if necessary....I’ve mentioned just a few examples here, but whatever its virtues (and there are some, as I’ve been at pains to suggest), the deficiencies I’ve described characterize the “new anti-Semitism” literature as a whole. For examples, consult Phyllis Chesler’s The New Anti-Semitism (pp. 4, 171-179, 182-185), Abraham Foxman’s Never Again: The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism (pp. 17-21), Alan Dershowitz’s The Case for Israel (p. 210), the writings of Bat Ye’or, as well as scattered essays in Rosenbaum’s anthology, Commentary, at WorldNet.Daily, or in your local Jewish paper. The modus operandi is more or less the same: First we are informed, accurately enough, of the existence of the new anti-Semitism. Then we are told that anti-Zionism is now ubiquitously used as a cover for that anti-Semitism. From there we skate imperceptibly to the equation of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism. And from there we are blackmailed into accepting the equation on pain of being accused of anti-Semitism."
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palestine Monitor]], a Palestinian advocacy group, is critical of what it characterizes as a modern trend to expand the definition of the term "antisemitic", and states that the new definitions are overly vague and allow for "indiscriminate accusations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Anti Anti Semitism With Norman Finkelstein
|date=12 October 2009
}}:  An article reviewing [[Beyond Chutzpah|Finkelstein's book ''Beyond Chutzpah'']]:
:"For a more profound explanation of Israeli's emerging opponents, the Zionist lobby blames 'new anti-Semitism'; a term nebulous and versatile enough to fit most any opponent. Arnold Foster and Benjamin Epstein define it as 'callous indifference to Jewish concerns, a failure to understand the most profound apprehension of Jewish people.' A 2007 British government investigation into racism counted 'perceptions of Anti-Semitism' as an example of it. Naturally such vagaries allow for almost indiscriminate accusations. Phyllis Chesler, author of A New Anti-Semitism casts her net wide to include as Israeli's enemies 'western-based international human rights organisations, western anti-capitalist, anti-globalist, pro-environment, anti-war and anti-racist activists, progressive feminists, Jewish feminists and the left and liberal American media'."
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Klug]] argues that anti-Zionism sometimes is a manifestation of antisemitism, but that "[t]hey are separate" and that to equate them is to incorrectly "conflate the Jewish state with the Jewish people."&lt;ref&gt;Klug:
:"There is a long and ignoble history of "Zionist" being used as a code word for "Jew," as when [[Communist Poland]] carried out "anti-Zionist" purges in 1968, expelling thousands of Jews from the country, or when the extreme right today uses the acronym [[Zionist Occupation Government|ZOG]] (Zionist Occupied Government) to refer to the [[US government]]. Moreover, the Zionist movement arose as a reaction to the persecution of Jews. Since anti-Zionism is the opposite of Zionism, and since Zionism is a form of opposition to anti-Semitism, it seems to follow that an anti-Zionist must be an anti-Semite.  Nonetheless, the inference is invalid. To argue that hostility to Israel and hostility to Jews are one and the same thing is to conflate the Jewish state with the Jewish people. In fact, Israel is one thing, Jewry another. Accordingly, anti-Zionism is one thing, anti-Semitism another. They are separate. To say they are separate is not to say that they are never connected. But they are independent variables that can be connected in different ways."&lt;/ref&gt;

Earl Raab, founding director of the Nathan Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at [[Brandeis University]] writes that "[t]here is a new surge of antisemitism in the world, and much prejudice against Israel is driven by such antisemitism," but argues that charges of antisemitism based on anti-Israel opinions generally lack credibility. He writes that "a grave educational misdirection is imbedded in formulations suggesting that if we somehow get rid of antisemitism, we will get rid of anti-Israelism. This reduces the problems of prejudice against Israel to cartoon proportions." Raab describes prejudice against Israel as a "serious breach of morality and good sense," and argues that it is often a bridge to antisemitism, but distinguishes it from antisemitism as such.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, Earl. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_4_51/ai_106730943 "Antisemitism, anti-Israelism, anti-Americanism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206051930/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_4_51/ai_106730943 |date=2007-12-06 }}, ''Judaism'', Fall 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irfan Khawaja suggests that some legitimate criticisms of Israel are improperly attacked by deliberately conflating them with criticisms that are anti-Semitic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Khawaja:
:"These claims [that critics of Israel are anti-Semitic] are a textbook example of the fallacy of [[poisoning the well]]—the fallacy, in logic, of rebutting someone’s argument by adducing the ulterior motives he might have had for making it.  Well poisoning is a ubiquitous feature of our misologistic culture, but Hanson’s commission of the fallacy differs from the run-of-the-mill variety by its subtle introduction of the issue of anti-Semitism. The claim here is not the truism that Arab anti-Semitism finds resonance in Europe, but that such interest as “the world” expresses in Palestine is merely a cover for its anti-Semitism.  This claim is a casual instance of a broader trend: the reflexive equation, by defenders of Israel, of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, itself part of the emerging literature on “the new anti-Semitism.” Focusing on the undeniable fact that many anti-Zionists are anti-Semites, and that anti-Zionism can easily be used as a disguise for anti-Semitism, writers in this genre simply insist over and over that no one can be an anti-Zionist without simultaneously being an anti-Semite."
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Cockburn]] and [[Jeffrey St. Clair]], in the book ''[[The Politics of Anti-Semitism]]'', write "Apologists for Israel's repression of Palestinians toss the word 'anti-Semite' at any critic of what Zionism has meant in practice for Palestinians on the receiving end.  So some of the essays in this book address the issue of what constitutes genuine anti-Semitism – Jew-hatred – as opposed to disingenuous, specious charges of 'anti-Semitism' hurled at rational appraisals of the state of Israel's political, military, and social conduct."&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn, p vii&lt;/ref&gt;

====Represents Jews as victims====
[[Norman Finkelstein]] and Steven Zipperstein (professor of Jewish Culture and History at [[Stanford University]]) suggest that criticism of Israel is sometimes inappropriately considered to be anti-Semitism due to an inclination to perceive Jews as victims.  Zipperstein suggests that the common attitude of seeing Jews as victims is sometimes implicitly transferred to the perception of Israel as a victim; while Finkelstein suggests that the depiction of Israel as a victim (as a "Jew among nations") is a deliberate ploy to stifle criticism of Israel.
&lt;ref&gt;
* Zipperstein, p 61:
:Steven Zipperstein, argues that a belief in the State of Israel's responsibility for the Arab-Israeli conflict is considered "part of what a reasonably informed, progressive, decent person thinks." He argues that Jews have a tendency to see the State of Israel as a victim because they were very recently themselves "the quintessential victims."
* Finkelstein p 16:
:"To evade the obvious, another stratagem of the Israel's lobby is playing The Holocaust and 'new anti-Semitism' cards.   In a previous study, I examined how the Nazi holocaust had been fashioned into an ideological weapon to immunize Israel from legitimate criticism.  In this book I look at a variant of this Holocaust card, namely, the 'new anti-Semitism'.  In fact, the allegation of a new anti-Semitism is neither new nor about anti-Semitism.  Whenever Israel comes under renewed international pressure to withdraw from occupied territories, its apologists mount yet another meticulously orchestrated media extravaganza alleging that the world is awash in anti-Semitism.  This shameless exploitation of anti-Semitism delegitimizes criticism of Israel, makes Jews rather than Palestinians the victims, and puts the onus on the Arab world to rid itself  of anti-Semitism rather than on Israel to rid itself of the Occupied Territories.   A close examination of what the Israel lobby tallies as anti-Semitism reveals three components:  exaggeration and fabrication;  mislabeling legitimate criticism of Israeli policy; and the unjustified yet predictable 'spillover' from criticism of Israel to Jews generally."
*Finkelstein p 33:
:"The dominant trope of the new 'new anti-Semitism' is that Israel has become the 'Jew among nations'…. In their 1982 study the Perlmuters pointed out the 'transformation … from anti-Semitism against Jews to anti-Semitism the object of which is the Jews' surrogate: Israel'… The transparent motive behind these assertions is to taint any criticism of Israel as motivated by anti-Semitism and - inverting reality - to turn Israel (and Jews), not Palestinians, in the victim of the 'current siege' (Chesler)."
* Finkelstein quotes four authors (who support the notion of New Antisemitism) who he claims rely on the victim perception:   Chesler, Zuckerman, Cotler, and Schoenfeld
&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Self-hating" Jews====
{{see also|Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism}}
[[Sander Gilman]] has written, "One of the most recent forms of Jewish self-hatred is the virulent opposition to the existence of the State of Israel."&lt;ref name="Gilman"&gt;Sander Gilman, "Jewish Self-Hatred: Anti-Semitism and the Hidden Language of the Jews," Baltimore:Johns Hopkins University Press 1986, pp. 361.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the term not against those who criticize Israel's policy, but against Jews who oppose Israel's existence.
[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]], editor of [[Tikkun (magazine)|''Tikkun'' magazine]],  asserts that the equation of Criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism has resulted in conflict within the Jewish community, in particular, proponents of the equation sometimes attack Jewish critics of Israeli policies as "[[self-hating Jew]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Lerner:
:"Yet there is nothing "new" about this or about this alleged anti-Semitism that these mainstream Jewish voices seek to reveal. From the moment I started Tikkun Magazine twenty years ago as "the liberal alternative to Commentary and the voices of Jewish conservatism and spiritual deadness in the organized Jewish community," our magazine has been attacked in much of the organized Jewish community as "self-hating Jews" (though our editorial advisory board contains some of the most creative Jewish theologians, rabbis, Israeli peace activist and committed fighters for social justice). The reason? We believe that Israeli policy toward Palestinians, manifested most dramatically in the Occupation of the West Bank for what will soon be forty years and in the refusal of Israel to take any moral responsibility for its part in the creation of the Arab refugee problem, is immoral, irrational, self-destructive, a violation of the highest values of the Jewish people, and a serious impediment to world peace."
&lt;/ref&gt;  Lerner also claims that the equation of Criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism and the resulting charges of "self hating Jew" has resulted in the alienation of young Jews from their faith.&lt;ref&gt;
Lerner:
The impact of the silencing of debate about Israeli policy on Jewish life has been devastating. We at Tikkun are constantly encountering young Jews who say that they can no longer identify with their Jewishness, because they have been told that their own intuitive revulsion at watching the Israeli settlers, with IDF support, violate the human rights of Palestinian civilians in the West Bank, or their own questioning of Israel's right to occupy the West Bank, are proof that they are "self-hating Jews." The Jewish world is driving away its own young.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antony Lerman]] believes that many attacks on Jewish critics of Israel are "vitriolic, ad hominem and indiscriminate" and claims that [[anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism]] have been defined too broadly and without reason.&lt;ref&gt;Lerman, "Jews attacking Jews":
:"Anti-Semitism can be disguised as anti-Zionism, and a Jew can be an anti-Semite. In principle, therefore, exposing an alleged Jewish anti-Semite is legitimate. But if you read the growing literature that does this - in print, on Web sites and in blogs - you find that it exceeds all reason: The attacks are often vitriolic, ad hominem and indiscriminate. Aspersions are cast on the Jewishness of individuals whom the attacker cannot possibly know. The charge of Jewish "self-hatred" - another way of calling someone a Jewish anti-Semite - is used ever more frequently, despite mounting evidence that it's an entirely bogus concept.  Anything from strong criticism of Israel's policies, through sympathetic critiques of Zionism, to advocacy of a one-state solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict, is defined as anti-Zionism, when none of these positions are prima facie anti-Zionist. Many attackers endow their targets with the ability to bring disaster and dissolution to the Jewish people, thereby making it a national and religious duty for Jews to wage a war of words against other Jews."
&lt;/ref&gt;  Lerman also states that the "redefinition" of anti-Semitism to include anti-Zionism has caused Jews to attack other Jews, because many Jews are leaders in several anti-Zionist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Lerman: ''Jews attacking Jews'':
:"The equation 'anti-Zionism = anti-Semitism' has thus become the new orthodoxy, and has even earned the seal of approval of the European Union. Its racism and anti-Semitism monitoring center (the [Fundamental] Rights Agency) produced a 'working definition' of anti-Semitism, with examples of five ways in which anti-Israel or anti-Zionist rhetoric is anti-Semitic. The 2006 report of the U.K.'s All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism urged the adoption of the EU definition, and the U.S. State Department's 2008 report 'Contemporary Global Anti-Semitism' is also based on it.  The redefinition of anti-Semitism has led to a further radical change in confronting the phenomenon. Many Jews are at the forefront of the growing number of anti-Israel or anti-Zionist groups. So, perceived manifestations of the 'new anti-Semitism' increasingly result in Jews attacking other Jews for their alleged anti-Semitic anti-Zionism."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas Saphir, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the [[New Israel Fund]] in the UK published an open letter defending [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) that operate within Israel to promote civil rights. He said that several organisations such as [[NGO Monitor]], Israel Resource News Agency, [[WorldNetDaily]] and the Near and Middle East Policy Review "associate moral and ethical criticism of any activity by Israel or the policies of its Government as being anti-Israel, anti-Semitic and when conducted by Jews, as evidence of self-hatred."&lt;ref&gt;

:"Several organisations such as the self-styled NGO Monitor, Israel Resource News Agency, WorldNetDaily and the Near and Middle East Policy Review are promoting the view that the work of Human Rights NGOs working in Israel is, by its very nature, anti-Israel. Their charge is to associate moral and ethical criticism of any activity by Israel or the policies of its Government as being anti-Israel, anti-Semitic and when conducted by Jews, as evidence of self-hatred."
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scare tactics====
The [[International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network]] is also opposed to the use of the antisemitic label to suppress criticism, and objected to the "fear tactics" employed when the anti-Semitic label was applied to supporters of [[Israel Apartheid Week]], claiming that it was reminiscent of the [[Red Scare|anti-Communist scare tactics of the 1950s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:"We are appalled by recent attempts of prominent Jewish organizations and leading Canadian politicians to silence protest against the State of Israel. We are alarmed by the escalation of fear tactics. Charges that those organizing Israel Apartheid Week or supporting an academic boycott of Israel are anti-Semites promoting hatred bring the anti-Communist terror of the 1950s vividly to mind. We believe this serves to deflect attention from Israel’s flagrant violations of international humanitarian law…. We recognize that anti-Semitism is a reality in Canada as elsewhere, and we are fully committed to resisting any act of hatred against Jews. At the same time, we condemn false charges of anti-Semitism against student organizations, unions, and other groups and people exercising their democratic right to freedom of speech and association regarding legitimate criticism of the State of Israel."
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]] suggests that some United States politicians are reluctant to criticise Israel because they are afraid of being labelled anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;
Lerner, referring to the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC):
:"But the most destructive impact of this new Jewish Political Correctness is on American foreign policy debates. We at Tikkun have been involved in trying to create a liberal alternative to AIPAC and the other Israel-can-do-no-wrong voices in American politics. When we talk to Congressional representatives who are liberal or even extremely progressive on every other issue, they tell us privately that they are afraid to speak out about the way Israeli policies are destructive to the best interests of the United States or the best interests of world peace—lest they too be labeled anti-Semitic and anti-Israel. If it can happen to Jimmy Carter, some of them told me recently, a man with impeccable moral credentials, then no one is really politically safe."
&lt;/ref&gt;  Lerner also states that groups that promote peace in the mid-East are afraid to form coalitions, lest they be discredited by what Lerner terms the "Jewish Establishment".&lt;ref&gt;
Lerner:
"Even better if we could succeed in creating a powerful alternative to AIPAC. Unfortunately, that path is not so easy. When we approached some of the Israel peace groups to form an alliance with us to build the alternative to AIPAC we found that the hold of the Jewish Establishment was so powerful that it had managed to seep into the brains of people in organizations like Americans for Peace Now (not the Israeli group Peace Now which has been very courageous), Brit Tzedeck ve'Shalom and the Israel Policy Forum or the Religious Action Center of the Reform movement. As a result  these peace voices are continually fearful that they will be "discredited" if they align with each other and with us to create this alternative to AIPAC. Meanwhile, while they look over their right shoulders fearfully, the very people that they fear will "discredit" them for aligning with each other and with us are already discrediting them as much as they possibly can."
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Draws attention away from genuine antisemitism====
[[Brian Klug]] asserts that proponents of New Antisemitism define antisemitism so broadly that they deprive the term "antisemitism" of all meaning.   Klug writes: "... when anti-Semitism is everywhere, it is nowhere. And when every anti-Zionist is an anti-Semite, we no longer know how to recognize the real thing--the concept of anti-Semitism loses its significance."&lt;ref&gt;
Klug:
:"In defense of her [Chesler's] assertion that there is a global "war against the Jews," Chesler wields the ultimate weapon. "In my opinion," she says, "anyone who denies that this is so or who blames the Jews for provoking the attacks is an anti-Semite." Since I deny that there is such a war, this makes me an anti-Semite. But since her argument empties the word of all meaning, I do not feel maligned. In his contribution to A New Antisemitism?, historian Peter Pulzer, faulting the way "the liberal press" sometimes reports the activities of the Israel Defense Forces in the occupied territories, makes a telling point about the misuse of words. He says: "When every civilian death is a war crime, that concept loses its significance. When every expulsion from a village is genocide, we no longer know how to recognize genocide. When Auschwitz is everywhere, it is nowhere." Point taken. But equally, when anti-Semitism is everywhere, it is nowhere. And when every anti-Zionist is an anti-Semite, we no longer know how to recognize the real thing--the concept of anti-Semitism loses its significance."
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[The Politics of Anti-Semitism]]'' Scott Handleman writes: "Partisans of Israel often make false accusations of anti-Semitism to silence Israel's critics. The 'antisemite' libel is harmful not only because it censors debate about Israel's racism and human rights abuses but because it trivializes the ugly history of Jew-hatred."&lt;ref&gt;Handleman, Scott, "Trivializing Jew-Hatred," in ''[[The Politics of Anti-Semitism]]'', ed. [[Alexander Cockburn]].  AK Press, 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excessive accusations of antisemitism may result in backlash====
[[Brian Klug]] argues that excessive claims of anti-Semitism (leveled at critics of Israel) may backfire and contribute to anti-Semitism, and he writes "a [[McCarthyism|McCarthyite]] tendency to see anti-Semites under every bed, arguably contributes to the climate of hostility toward Jews"&lt;ref&gt;
Klug:
:"a McCarthyite tendency to see anti-Semites under every bed, arguably contributes to the climate of hostility toward Jews. The result is to make matters worse for the very people these authors mean to defend."
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Judt]] also suggests that Israel's "insistent identification" of criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism is now the leading source of anti-Jewish sentiment in the world.&lt;ref&gt;
*Judt:
:"In many parts of the world this is in danger of becoming a self-fulfilling assertion: Israel's reckless behavior and insistent identification of all criticism with anti-Semitism is now the leading source of anti-Jewish sentiment in Western Europe and much of Asia. But the traditional corollary - if anti-Jewish feeling is linked to dislike of Israel then right-thinking people should rush to Israel's defense - no longer applies. Instead, the ironies of the Zionist dream have come full circle: For tens of millions of people in the world today, Israel is indeed the state of all the Jews. And thus, reasonably enough, many observers believe that one way to take the sting out of rising anti-Semitism in the suburbs of Paris or the streets of Jakarta would be for Israel to give the Palestinians back their land."
*See also Finkelstein, p xxxv:
:"In a feature ''Haaretz'' article marking the fifty-eighth anniversary of Israel's founding, a leading American-Jewish academic now gives expression to the identical analysis: 'Israel's reckless behavior and insistent identification of all criticism with anti-Semitism' Tony Judt writes, 'is now the leading source of anti-Jewish sentiment in Western Europe and much of Asia …. One way to take the sting out of rising anti-Semitism in the suburbs of Paris or the streets of Jakarta would be force Israel to give the Palestinians back their land'." [Finkelstein is citing Judt]
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]] echos those thoughts and suggests that the continued "repression" of criticism of Israel may eventually "explode" in an outburst of genuine anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;
Lerner:
:"When this bubble of repression of dialogue explodes into open resentment at the way Jewish Political correctness has been imposed, it may really yield a "new" anti-Semitism. To prevent that, the voices of dissent on Israeli policy must be given the same national exposure in the media and American politics that the voices of the Jewish establishment have been given.... We hope that the creation of our interfaith Network of Spiritual Progressives (NSP at spiritualprogressives.org) can provide a safe context for this kind of discussion among the many Christians, Muslims, Unitarians, Hindus, Buddhists and secular-but-not-religious people who share some of the criticisms of Israel and who will eventually try to challenge the kind of anti-Semitism that might be released against Jews once the resentment about Jewish Political Correctness on Israel does explode."
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attacking the messenger rather than the message====
[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]] claims that some supporters of Israel refuse to discuss legitimate criticisms of Israel (such as comparisons with [[apartheid]]) and instead attack the people who raise such criticisms, thus deliberately "shifting the discourse to the legitimacy of the messenger and thus avoiding the substance of the criticisms".&lt;ref&gt;
Lerner:
:"The Anti-Defamation League sponsored a conference on this same topic in San Francisco on January 28, conspicuously failing to invite Tikkun, Jewish Voices for Peace and Brit Tzedeck ve Shalom, the three major Jewish voices critiquing Israeli policy, yet also strong supporters of Israel's security. Meanwhile, the media has been abuzz with stories of Jews denouncing former President Jimmy Carter for his book Palestine: Peace or Apartheid. The same charges of anti-Semitism that have consistently been launched against anyone who criticizes Israeli policy is now being launched against the one American leader who managed to create a lasting (albeit cold) peace between Israel and a major Arab state (Egypt). Instead of seriously engaging with the issues raised (e.g. to what extent are Israel's current policies similar to those of apartheid and to what extent are they not?), the Jewish establishment and media responds by attacking the people who raise these or any other critiques--shifting the discourse to the legitimacy of the messenger and thus avoiding the substance of the criticisms. Knowing this, many people become fearful that they too will be labeled "anti-Semitic" if they question the wisdom of Israeli policies or if they seek to organize politically to challenge those policies."
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exaggerating the equation in order to draw sympathy====
[[Alan Dershowitz]] distinguishes between legitimate criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism, but he claims that some "enemies of Israel" encourage the equation of the two, because it makes the enemies appear to be victims of false accusations of anti-Semitism, which the enemies use in an attempt to gain sympathy for their cause.&lt;ref&gt;
Dershowitz: ''The Case Against Israel's Enemies'', pp 3-4:
:"No one should ever confuse criticism of Israel or of Israeli policies with anti-Semitism.  And no one should ever accuse mere critics of Israel with anti-Semitism.  If criticism of Israel or Israeli policies constituted anti-Semitism then the highest concentration of anti-Semites would be in Israel, where everybody is a critic… The claim that critics of Israel are branded as anti-Semites is a straw man and a fabrication of Israel's enemies who seek to play the victim card.  Yet this big lie persists.  Susannah Heschel, a professor of Jewish studies at Dartmouth, has charged, 'We often hear that criticism of Israel is equivalent to anti-Semitism'.  Michael Lerner, the editor of ''Tikkun'', has made a similar charge.  So has [[Noam Chomsky]].  More recently, a vocal professor at Harvard, [[J. Lorand Matory|Lorand Matory]], has made this accusation…. [[Thomas Friedman]] of the New York Times [wrote]… 'Criticizing Israel is not anti-Semitism, and saying so is vile.  But singling out Israel for opprobrium and international sanction - out of all proportion to any other party in the Middle East - is anti-Semitism, and no saying so is dishonest."
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suppression of criticism==
{{further|Israel lobby in the United States#Responses to criticism of Israel}}

A number of commentators have debated whether public criticism of Israel is suppressed outside of Israel, particularly within the United States. [[Stephen Zunes]] writes that "assaults on critics of Israeli policies have been more successful in limiting open debate, but this gagging censorship effect stems more from ignorance and liberal guilt than from any all-powerful Israel lobby."&lt;ref name="StephenZunesFPIC"&gt;[[Stephen Zunes]], [http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/3270 The Israel Lobby: How Powerful is it Really?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516223818/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/3270 |date=May 16, 2006 }}, [[Foreign Policy in Focus]], May 16, 2006. Retrieved August 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to explain that while "some [[criticism of Israel]] really is rooted in [[anti-Semitism]]," it is his opinion that some members of the Israel lobby cross the line by labeling intellectually honest critics of Israel as anti-Semitic.&lt;ref name=StephenZunesFPIC/&gt; Zunes argues that the mainstream and conservative Jewish organizations have "created a climate of intimidation against many who speak out for peace and human rights or who support the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]' right of [[self-determination]]."&lt;ref name=StephenZunesFPIC/&gt; Zunes has been on the receiving end of this criticism himself: "As a result of my opposition to US support for the Israeli government's policies of occupation, colonization and repression, I have been deliberately misquoted, subjected to slander and libel, and falsely accused of being "anti-Semitic" and "supporting terrorism"; my children have been harassed and my university's administration has been bombarded with calls for my dismissal."&lt;ref name=StephenZunesFPIC/&gt; In an opinion piece for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Jimmy Carter]] wrote that mainstream American politics does not give equal time to the Palestinian side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and that this is due at least in part to AIPAC.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Carter, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1970058,00.html Israel, Palestine, peace and apartheid], Guardian Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Soros]] has claimed that there are risks associated with what was in his opinion a suppression of debate:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views."&lt;ref&gt;Soros, George.  [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20030 "On Israel, America and AIPAC."] ''New York Review of Books'', April 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, in his book, ''[[The Deadliest Lies]]'', [[Abraham Foxman]] referred to the notion that the pro-Israel lobby is trying to censor criticism of Israel as a "[[Hoax|canard]]."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[[Abraham Foxman|Foxman, Abraham]].

===Criticism stifled by accusations of antisemitism===
Several commentators have asserted that supporters of Israel attempt to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel by unfairly labeling critics as [[antisemitic]].

[[File:Norman finkelstein suffolk.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Norman Finkelstein]] author of ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'']]
One of the major themes of [[Norman Finkelstein]]'s book ''[[Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History]]'' is that some supporters of Israel employ accusations of anti-Semitism to attack critics of Israel, with the goal of discrediting the critics and silencing the criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein.  This is a major theme of the book, but is especially discussed in the Introduction and chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}} Professors [[Judy Rebick]] and [[Alan Sears]], in response to [[Israel Apartheid Week]] activities at [[Carleton University]], wrote an open letter to the University president which claimed that accusations of anti-Semitism are sometimes made with the goal of "silencing" criticism of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, Alan and Rebick, Judy, "Memo to Minister Kenney: Criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitism",  [http://www.rabble.ca/news/memo-minister-kenney-criticism-israel-not-anti-semitism online]: "Defenders of Israeli policy routinely attempt to direct our attention to abuses happening in other places and insist that a hidden agenda must underlie any focus on Israeli brutality in this unjust world. This argument would lead to paralysis in human rights activism by claiming that one must address all cases at once, or only the "worst" cases. Should we have told Rosa Parks, who refused to go the back of a segregated bus in Alabama in 1955, to quit whining as conditions were even worse in South Africa, or colonized Kenya, or for that matter for Palestinians in refugee camps?  The deployment of anti-Semitism as an accusation to silence criticism of Israel is also a serious setback in genuine struggles against anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination. It is based on a claim that the State of Israel is the single outcome of the history of the Jewish people, the final end of generations of diasporic existence. It attempts to make the Zionist project of a Jewish nation the only legitimate project for all Jews." They were writing regarding Israel Apartheid Week controversy described [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1067277.html in Haaretz].&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Peter Beaumont (journalist)|Peter Beaumont]] also claims that some proponents of the concept of [[New Antisemitism]] conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont, Peter, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,11581,651685,00.html "The new anti-semitism?"], ''The Observer'', February 17, 2002: "But the problem with all this talk of a 'new anti-Semitism' is that those who argue hardest for its inexorable rise are dangerously conflating two connected but critically separate phenomena. The monster that they have conjured from these parts is not only something that does not yet exist - and I say 'yet' with caution - but whose purported existence is being cynically manipulated by some in the Israeli government to try to silence debate about the policies of the Sharon government…. As data collected by the Stephen Roth Institute at Tel Aviv University, and other research, makes clear, the rise in anti-Semitism in Europe coincided with the beginning of al-Aqsa intifada - and Israel's heavy-handed response…. What they are talking about is the criticism in the media and political classes of Europe of the policies of Sharon. Israel's brutal response to the often equally reprehensible anti-Israeli Palestinian violence of the intifada has produced one of the most vigorous media critiques of Israel's policies in the European media in a generation. The reply to this criticism, say those most vocal in reporting the existence of the new anti-Semitism, particularly in the Israeli press, is devastating in its simplicity: criticise Israel, and you are an anti-Semite just as surely as if you were throwing paint at a synagogue in Paris."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tariq Ali]], a British-Pakistani historian and political activist, argues that the concept of new antisemitism amounts to an attempt to subvert the language in the interests of the State of Israel. He writes that the campaign against "the supposed new 'anti-semitism'" in modern Europe is a "cynical ploy on the part of the Israeli Government to seal off the Zionist state from any criticism of its regular and consistent brutality against the Palestinians....  Criticism of Israel can not and should not be equated with anti-semitism." He argues that most pro-Palestinian, anti-Zionist groups that emerged after the [[Six-Day War]] were careful to observe the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism.&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;[[Tariq Ali|Ali, Tariq]]. [http://www.counterpunch.org/ali03042004.html "Notes on Anti-Semitism, Zionism and Palestine"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207122412/http://www.counterpunch.org/ali03042004.html |date=December 7, 2010 }}, ''Counterpunch'', March 4, 2004, first published in ''il manifesto'', February 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish Voice for Peace]] has spoken against what they see as the abuse of the antisemitic label. For example, in an opinion piece, they wrote "For decades, some leaders of the Jewish community have made the preposterous claim that there is complete unity of belief and interest between all Jews and the Israeli government, no matter what its policies. They must believe their own propaganda, because they see no difference between criticism of the Israeli government and anti-Semitism, and they do everything they can to silence critical voices. If the brand of anti-Semitism is not sufficiently intimidating, the silencing has been enforced by organized phone and letter-writing campaigns, boycotts, threats of, and actual withdrawal of funding support from 'offending' institutions and individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|author=Henri Picciotto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accusations are public relations efforts====
[[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]] claim that the accusations of anti-Semitism leveled at critics of Israel are deliberately timed to defuse the impact of the criticisms.  They suggest a pattern where accusations of antisemitism rise immediately following aggressive actions by Israel: following the [[Six-Day War]], following the [[1982 Lebanon War]], and following exposure of "brutal behavior in the Occupied Territories" in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Mearsheimer and Walt, p 190: "Supporters of Israel have a history of using fears of a "new antiSemitism" to shield Israel from criticism. In 1974, when Israel was under increasing pressure to withdraw from the lands it had conquered in 1967, Arnold Forster and Benjamin Epstein of the ADL published ''The New Anti-Semitism'', which argued that anti-Semitism was on the rise and exemplified by the growing unwillingness of other societies to support Israel's actions. In the early 1980s, when the invasion of Lebanon and Israel's expanding settlements triggered additional criticisms, and when U.S. arms sales to its Arab allies were hotly contested, then ADL head Nathan Perlmutter and his wife, Ruth Ann Perlmutter, released ''The Real Anti-Semitism in America'', which argued that anti-Semitism was on its way back, as shown by the pressure on Israel to make peace with the Arabs and by events like the sale of AWACS aircraft to Saudi Arabia.  The Perlmutters also suggested that many "anti-Semitic" actions, which they define as acts not motivated by hostility to Jews, may nonetheless harm Jewish interests (and especially Israel's well-being), and could easily bring back genuine anti-Semitism.  The troubling logic of this argument is revealed by the fact that there was little mention of anti-Semitism during the 1990s, when Israel was involved in the Oslo peace process. Indeed, one Israeli scholar wrote in 1995 that 'never before, at least since the time Christianity seized power over the Roman Empire, has anti-Semitism been less significant than at present'.  Charges of anti-Semitism became widespread only in the spring of 2002, when Israel came under severe criticism around the world for its brutal behavior in the Occupied Territories. … Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident who is now a prominent Israeli author and politician, declares, 'The new anti-Semitism appears in the guise of 'political criticism of Israel', consisting of a discriminating approach and double standard towards the state of the Jews, while questioning its right to exist.'  The implication is that any one who criticizes Israel's actions … is opposed to its existence and is therefore hostile to Jews.  But this is a bogus charge, because it conflates criticism of Israel's actions with the rejection of Israel's legitimacy."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norman Finkelstein]] says that to further a public relations campaign, apologists for Israel make accusations of what they call a "[[New Antisemitism|new anti-Semitism]]" against those they oppose, and that they do so deliberately in order to undermine critics and bolster the nation's image.&lt;ref&gt;
Finkelstein:
*page xxxiii:
:"The 'new anti-Semitism' is a spin-off of the Holocaust industry.  Whenever Israel comes under international pressure to resolve its conflict with the Palestinians diplomatically or faces a public relations debacle, its apologists mount a campaign alleging that the world is awash in a new anti-Semitism.  … the purpose of these periodic extravaganzas is not hard to find:  on the one hand, the perpetrators are turned into the victims, putting the spotlight on the alleged suffering of Jews today and diverting it from the real suffering of Palestinians; on the other hand, they  discredit all criticism of Israeli policy as motived by an irrational loathing of Jews."
*page 16:
:"To evade the obvious, another stratagem of the Israel's lobby is playing The Holocaust and 'new anti-Semitism' cards.   In a previous study, I examined how the Nazi holocaust had been fashioned into an ideological weapon to immunize Israel from legitimate criticism.  In this book I look at a variant of this Holocaust card, namely, the 'new anti-Semitism'.  In fact, the allegation of a new anti-Semitism is neither new nor about anti-Semitism.  Whenever Israel comes under renewed international pressure to withdraw from occupied territories, its apologists mount yet another meticulously orchestrated media extravaganza alleging that the world is awash in anti-Semitism.  This shameless exploitation of anti-Semitism delegitimizes criticism of Israel, makes Jews rather than Palestinians the victims, and puts the onus on the Arab world to rid itself  of anti-Semitism rather than on Israel to rid itself of the Occupied Territories.   A close examination of what the Israel lobby tallies as anti-Semitism reveals three components:  exaggeration and fabrication;  mislabeling legitimate criticism of Israeli policy; and the unjustified yet predictable 'spillover' from criticism of Israel to Jews generally."
&lt;/ref&gt;  Finkelstein also asserts that "American Jewish organizations" purposefully increase vocal accusations of anti-Semitism during episodes when Israel is coming under increased criticism (such as the during the Intifada), with the goal of discrediting critics of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;

:"Whenever Israel faces a public relations debacle such as the Intifada or international pressure to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict, American Jewish organizations orchestrate this extravaganza called the 'new anti-Semitism.' The purpose is several-fold. First, it is to discredit any charges by claiming the person is an anti-Semite. It's to turn Jews into the victims, so that the victims are not the Palestinians any longer. As people like Abraham Foxman of the ADL put it, the Jews are being threatened by a new holocaust. It's a role reversal – the Jews are now the victims, not the Palestinians. So it serves the function of discrediting the people leveling the charge. It's no longer Israel that needs to leave the Occupied Territories; it's the Arabs who need to free themselves of the anti-Semitism."
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critics of Israel who have been accused of antisemitism====
Critics of Israel who have been accused of antisemitism and have denied the allegation include [[Ralph Nader]], [[John Mearsheimer]], [[Cindy Sheehan]], [[Jenny Tonge]], [[Ken Livingstone]], [[Desmond Tutu]], and [[Helen Thomas]].

Professor [[J. Lorand Matory]] is a vocal critic of Israel who supports [[disinvestment from Israel]].  [[Larry Summers]], president of Harvard, called efforts by Matory and others to divest from Israel "[[anti-Semitic]] in effect, if not intent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.thejusticeonline.com/media/storage/paper573/news/2002/10/29/News/Divestment.Forum.Held.At.Harvard-309328.shtml|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090822231930/http://media.www.thejusticeonline.com/media/storage/paper573/news/2002/10/29/News/Divestment.Forum.Held.At.Harvard-309328.shtml|deadurl=yes|title=Divestment forum held at Harvard - News|date=22 August 2009|archivedate=22 August 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Matory,  "the knee jerk accusation that targeted criticism of Israel singles out Israel is as absurd as stating that the anti-apartheid movement was singling out South Africa."&lt;ref name="Crimson2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=513616|title=Summers Says British Boycott of Israeli Academics Is Intentionally 'Anti-Semitic'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Noam Chomsky]] argues that Israel's foreign minister [[Abba Eban]] equated anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism in an effort to "exploit anti-racist sentiment for political ends", citing statement Eban made in 1973: "One of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all." Commenting on Eban's statement, Chomsky replied: "That is a convenient stand.  It cuts off a mere 100 percent of critical comment!"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Menachem Wecker, "In Defense of Self-Hating Jews", May 2007, Jewish Currents, online at [http://www.jewishcurrents.org/2007-may-wecker.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, Chomsky wrote that this equation of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism was being extended to criticism of Israeli policies, not just criticism of Zionism.  Chomsky also wrote that, when the critics of Israel are Jewish, the accusations of anti-Semitism involve descriptions of [[Self-hating Jew|self-hatred]].&lt;ref&gt;
*Chomsky, ''Necessary Illusions'', p 316:
:"There have long been efforts to identify anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism in an effort to exploit anti-racist sentiment for political ends; 'one of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all,' Israeli diplomat Abba Eban argued, in a typical expression of this intellectually and morally disreputable position (Eban, Congress Bi-Weekly, March 30, 1973). But that no longer suffices. It is now necessary to identify criticism of Israeli policies as anti-Semitism -- or in the case of Jews, as 'self-hatred,' so that all possible cases are covered."
&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, Chomsky said "If you identify the country, the people, the culture with the rulers, accept the totalitarian doctrine, then yeah, it's anti-Semitic to criticize the Israeli policy, and anti-American to criticize the American policy, and it was anti-Soviet when the dissidents criticized Russian policy.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Oliver Kamm]] contends that Chomsky inaccurately interpreted Eban's comments.&lt;ref&gt;
Quoted by [[Oliver Kamm]] http://oliverkamm.typepad.com/blog/2005/02/chomsky_antisem.html
"Chomsky, antisemitism and intellectual standards"
"But note that by 2002, in his remarks to the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Chomsky is giving a flatly different account of Eban’s argument. What Eban is saying in the genuine quotation is that the denial of Israel’s statehood is equivalent to antisemitism. This is not at all the same thing as claiming that criticism of Israeli policies is equivalent to antisemitism. Chomsky’s interpolation – “By anti-Zionism he meant criticisms of the current policies of the State of Israel” – is not remotely supportable from the quotation. Chomsky has doctored his source in order to set up a straw man."

Musician [[Roger Waters]] is a critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians, and was accused by the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] of using anti-Semitic imagery in one of his recent musical productions.  Waters responded by stating that the ADL regularly portrays critics of Israel as anti-Semitic, and that "it is a screen they [the ADL] hide behind".&lt;ref&gt;
*Smith, Lewis, "Anti-Semitic? Not me, says Roger Waters", ''The Independent'', 4 October 2010, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/antisemitic-not-me-says-roger-waters-2096790.html online]:
:"Abraham Foxman, the director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), said using the dollar sign and the Star of David in sequence [during Water's performance] echoed the stereotype that Jews were avaricious.  Referring to criticism Waters has previously made of Israel for its treatment of the Palestinians, Mr. Foxman said the musician should have 'chosen some other way to convey his political views without playing into and dredging up the worst age-old anti-Semitic stereotype about Jews and their supposed obsession with making money'. …  [Waters replied:]  'If I don't respond [to the suggestion of antisemitism] people will see the story and will come to believe I'm anti-Semitic, and I'm not. Nothing could be further from the truth….'  Waters has spoken against Israeli policies and accused the ADL of painting critics as anti-Semitic. 'It's a screen that they hide behind. I don't think they should be taken seriously on that. You can attack Israeli policy without being anti-Jewish,' he [Waters] said."

[[File:Archbishop-Tutu-medium.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Desmond Tutu]]]]
In 2002 [[Desmond Tutu]] is a critic of Israel who has compared Israel's policies to apartheid South Africa.  Tutu wrote that criticism of Israel is suppressed in the United States, and that criticisms of Israel are "immediately dubbed anti-Semitic".&lt;ref&gt;
* Tutu, Desmond, “Apartheid in the Holy Land,” ''The Guardian'' (Britain), April 29, 2002. [https://www.theguardian.com/israel/comment/0,10551,706911,00.html online]
:" I've been very deeply distressed in my visit to the Holy Land; it reminded me so much of what happened to us black people in South Africa. I have seen the humiliation of the Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks, suffering like us when young white police officers prevented us from moving about.... But you know as well as I do that, somehow, the Israeli government is placed on a pedestal [in the US], and to criticise it is to be immediately dubbed anti-semitic, as if the Palestinians were not semitic. I am not even anti-white, despite the madness of that group. And how did it come about that Israel was collaborating with the apartheid government on security measures?  People are scared in this country [the US], to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful - very powerful."
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Prior (theologian)|Michael Prior]] was a vocal critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians, and who was frequently accused of anti-Semitism, yet he was careful to distinguish between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;
*"Father Michael Prior: Roman Catholic priest and scholar who campaigned for the rights of Palestinians", in ''The Times'', 21 August 2004, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article472227.ece online]:
:"In an interview in Witness in 2003, Father Prior said: “The God they portray looks to me to be a militaristic and xenophobic genocide who would not be even sufficiently moral to conform to the Fourth Geneva Convention. How, I constantly ask myself, are such people so unconcerned about others being kicked out of their homes, children being shot, people struggling for survival against very oppressive forces of occupation?” Needless to say, he was sometimes accused of being anti-Semitic. But he was careful to distinguish between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. He believed that Muslims, Jews and Christians could and should live in equality and harmony. In his last article, published in The Tablet shortly before his death, he warned that the Catholic-Jewish liaison committee’s decision to equate antiZionism with anti-Semitism was a grave mistake. He was convinced that Zionism flew in the face of the Hebrew Scriptures."

[[Ken Livingstone]], former mayor of the [[City of London]], was accused of antisemitism for a variety of comments, including remarks criticizing Israel's treatment of Palestinians.  In response, Livingstone wrote "For 20 years Israeli governments have attempted to portray anyone who forcefully criticizes the policies of Israel as anti-semitic. The truth is the opposite: the same universal human values that recognize the Holocaust as the greatest racist crime of the 20th century require condemnation of the policies of successive Israeli governments - not on the absurd grounds that they are Nazi or equivalent to the Holocaust, but because ethnic cleansing, discrimination and terror are immoral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Peace activist [[Cindy Sheehan]] claims she has been improperly accused of being anti-Semitic because of her anti-war position, particularly her criticism of the Israel lobby and Israel's actions towards Palestinians.  Sheehan emphasized that her criticism of Israel is "not to be construed as hatred of all Jews".&lt;ref&gt;
*Sheehan, Cindy,  [http://cindysheehanssoapbox.blogspot.com/2010/06/audacity-of-israel-by-cindy-sheehan.html "The Audacity of Israel"] on [[Cindy Sheehan's Soapbox]] online blog, June 4, 2010.
:"Since my son was killed in Iraq and I have come to prominence in the peace movement, the name I am called with the second highest frequency (behind “anti-American”) is “anti-Semitic."  First of all, isn’t it interesting if one is anti-violence and pro-peace, that automatically makes one anti-American and anti-Semitic? That just tells us that violence and oppression are so inherently institutionalized in our cultures, that if one is against these things, that makes one against the entire culture, race or way of life. It should be fundamentally understood that criticism of Israel’s program of Palestinian pogrom and the US’s demented foreign policy is not to be construed as hatred of all Jews or all Americans."
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critics that suggest censorship or suppression===
Political scientists [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]] wrote an article critical of the Israel lobby in the United States, in which they asserted that the Israel lobby uses accusations of anti-Semitism as a part of a deliberate strategy to suppress criticism of Israel.  Mearsheimer and Walt themselves were accused of anti-Semitism as a result of that article and [[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy|the book they wrote]] based on the article.&lt;ref&gt;
*Harrison, pp 194-195:
:"… Mearsheimer and Walt were widely accused of anti-Semitism and responded forcefully that, in their opinion, such accusations were baseless and were being leveled purely in order to suppress legitimate criticism of Israel and its supporters…. [their] thesis includes as a subordinate contention the claim that the Israel lobby uses the accusation of anti-Semitism purely as a tool to suppress criticism of Israel.  All talk of a 'new anti-Semitism' is asserted to be part of a deliberate strategy:  'Israel's advocates, when pressed to go beyond mere assertion, claim that there is a new anti-Semitism which they equate with criticism of Israel.  In other words, criticise Israeli policy, and you are by definition an anti-semite'."
*Harrison is quoting from Mearsheimer and Walt's 2006 article "The Israel Lobby" published in ''London Review of Books'', vol 28, no. 6, 23 March 2006.

[[Ralph Nader]], United States politician and consumer advocate, has criticized Israel's policies, expressed support for Palestinian causes, and criticized the excessive influence of the [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel lobby]] on the U. S. government. In response, Nader wrote a letter to the director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] entitled "Criticizing Israel is Not Anti-Semitism" in which he said "Your mode of operation for years has been to make charges of racism or insinuation of racism designed to slander and evade. Because your pattern of making such charges, carefully calibrated for the occasion but of the same stigmatizing intent, has served to deter critical freedom of speech....  The ADL should be working toward this objective [peace] and not trying to suppress realistic discourse on the subject with epithets and innuendos."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Nader|Nader, Ralph]], "A Letter to Abraham Foxman: Criticizing Israel is Not Anti-Semitism", in ''Counterpunch'', 16 October 2004, [http://www.counterpunch.org/nader10162004.html  online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707020003/http://www.counterpunch.org/nader10162004.html |date=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William I. Robinson]], a professor at [[UCSB]], was accused of being antisemitic due to a class assignment that revolved around Israel's attack on the [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] strip, and he replied by stating that the [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel lobby]] labels "any criticism" of Israel as anti-Semitic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/5556_62.htm|title=ADL commentary on Robinson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Robinson said:  "The fact that I did include my interpretation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is totally within what is normal and expected.... One of the most pressing affairs of January was the Israeli assault on [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] - there was nothing that could be more relevant to this course at that time.   When you bring up delicate, sensitive, inflammatory, controversial material in the classroom, we as professors are carrying out our mission to jar students in order to challenge them to think critically about world issues.... The Israel lobby is possibly the most powerful lobby in the United States, and what they do is label any criticism of anti-Israeli conduct and practices as anti-Semitic" Robinson said. "This campaign is not just an attempt to punish me. The [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel lobby]] is stepping up its vicious attacks on anyone who would speak out against Israeli policies." &lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, Elliot, "Investigation of Professor Forges Ahead", ''Daily Nexus'', [http://www.dailynexus.com/2009-06-04/investigation-of-professor-forges-ahead/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Steven Salaita]], an American expert on comparative literature and post-colonialism, became embroiled in a controversy regarding freedom of speech for faculty at American universities when his offer of employment was withdrawn from [[UIUC]] by Chancellor Dr. [[Phyllis Wise]], a move some regard as an infringement on Salaita's freedom of speech. During the 2014 conflict between Israel and Gaza, he had published tweets that were seen as criticism of the Israeli government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://open.salon.com/blog/designanator/2015/01/31/prof_fired_for_criticism_of_israel_files_federal_lawsuit  Prof. Fired for Criticism of Israel Files Federal Lawsuit] Salon, 31 Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and Salaita claims that as a result, pro-Israel advocates associated with the university accused him of anti-Semitism and pressured the university to rescind its offer of employment to him. As a result of his outspoken critique of the university's handling of his situation, [[Haaretz]] notes that Salaita has established "celebrity status on the lecture circuit."&lt;ref name="haaretz.com2"&gt;"Alexander, Netta  'I am no anti-Semite' says Steven Salaita, lecturer-cum celeb who was fired for tweeting: A few rude anti-Israel tweets during the Gaza war cost Dr. Steven Salaita an academic appointment, but earned him celebrity status on the lecture circuit.

==Responses to criticism==
{{Expand section|date=September 2014}}

===Claims of media bias===
{{see also|Media coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict}}
[[Mudar Zahran]], a Jordanian of Palestinian heritage, writes that the "tendency to blame Israel for everything" has provided Arab leaders an excuse to deliberately ignore the human rights of the Palestinian in their countries. As an example, he said that while the world is furious over the blockade on Gaza, the media choose to deliberately ignore the conditions of the Palestinians living in refugee camps in Lebanon and other Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=183252 Demonizing Israel is bad for the Palestinians], by Mudar Zarhan, 01/08/2010, Jerusalem Post&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of United Nations bias===
The United Nations has never condemned China's occupation of Tibet or recognized the Tibetans' right to self-determination. [[Alan Dershowitz]] finds the UN position hypocritical, as he concludes China's occupation of Tibet has been longer, more brutal, deadlier and less justified than Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dershowitz|first1=Alan|title=The case for Israel|date=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0471679523|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}

===Foreign Ministry===
[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)]] has encouraged the use of social media to counteract criticism of Israel's policies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} One member of the diplomatic corps proposed more aggressive action regarding Israel's critics. In June 2012, Israel's Channel 10 published an e-mail in which [[Nurit Tinari-Modai]], deputy head of Israel's mission in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and wife of the ambassador, [[Boaz Moda'i]], proposed harassing expatriate Israelis who criticized Israeli policies, posting photos of them and publishing disinformation that would embarrass them. She claimed that they were critical of Israel because of their sexual identity. Following the publicity about Tinari-Modai's tactics, the Foreign Ministry quickly distanced itself from her letter. Her recommendation included the following :"You have to try and hit their soft underbellies, to publish their photographs, maybe that will cause embarrassment from their friends in Israel and their family, hoping that local activists would understand that they may actually be working on behalf of Mossad."&lt;ref&gt;"Round, Simon 'Israeli envoy: activists have 'sexual identity problems'' (June 14, 2012) The Jewish Chronicle"http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/68791/israeli-envoy-activists-have-sexual-identity-problems&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/un-made-hitler-happy-israels-irish-embassy-says/|title=Israel’s Irish embassy: UN would have made Hitler happy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Silver, Jonny 'Israel’s Ireland embassy: Hitler would have liked the UN' (Aug. 6, 2013) Haaretz"http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.540074&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli public opinion===
International criticism is  an important focus within Israel. According to an August 2010 survey by Tel Aviv University, more than half of Israelis believe "the whole world is against us", and three quarters of Israelis believe "that no matter what Israel does or how far it goes towards resolving the conflict with the Palestinians, the world will continue to criticize Israel".&lt;ref name="peace index"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tel Aviv University, Israel Democracy Institute, Peace Index August 2010|url=http://peaceindex.org/indexMonthEng.aspx?num=56|accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Public diplomacy (Israel)|public diplomacy]] has been an important focus of Israeli governments since Independence. The Israeli [[Information and Diaspora Minister of Israel|Ministry of Public Diplomacy &amp; Diaspora Affairs]] seeks to explain government policies and promote Israel in the face of what they consider negative press about Israel around the world.

===Criminalization of Nazi comparisons===
The EISCA Report recommends that the British government criminalize certain kinds of anti-Semitism, particularly use of the Nazi analogy to criticize Israel, as well as other forms of criticism of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Igansky, EISCA Report, pp 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Craig Roberts]] and [[Antony Lerman]] have questioned the recommendations of the EISCA report, expressing concerns that the   recommendations of the report may be adopted as a hate-crime law within Europe, which may lead to infringement of free speech, and may criminalize legitimate criticism of Israel.

Author [[Paul Craig Roberts]] is opposed to legislation in the United States will make it a crime to criticize Israel, and as examples he cites the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004 and the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act|Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009]].  Roberts asserts that lobbyists for Israel are pressing for laws that will make it a crime to discuss the power of the Israel lobby, or to discuss alleged war crimes of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Paul Craig, "The End of Free Speech? Criminalizing Criticism of Israel", ''Counterpunch'' 7 May 2009,  [http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts05072009.html online]:
:"On October 16, 2004, President George W. Bush signed the Israel Lobby’s bill, the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act. This legislation requires the US Department of State to monitor anti-semitism world wide. To monitor anti-semitism, it has to be defined.  What is the definition?  Basically, as defined by the Israel Lobby and Abe Foxman, it boils down to any criticism of Israel or Jews. Rahm Israel Emanuel hasn’t been mopping floors at the White House.  As soon as he gets the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 passed, it will become a crime for any American to tell the truth about Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and theft of their lands. It will be a crime for Christians to acknowledge the New Testament's account of Jews demanding the crucifixion of Jesus. It will be a crime to report the extraordinary influence of the Israel Lobby on the White House and Congress, such as the AIPAC-written resolutions praising Israel for its war crimes against the Palestinians in Gaza that were endorsed by 100 per cent  of the US Senate and 99 per cent  of the House of Representatives, while the rest of the world condemned Israel for its barbarity. It will be a crime to doubt the Holocaust. It will become a crime to note the disproportionate representation of Jews in the media, finance, and foreign policy. In other words, it means the end of free speech, free inquiry, and the First Amendment to the Constitution. Any facts or truths that cast aspersion upon Israel will simply be banned…. Criminalizing criticism of Israel destroys any hope of America having an independent foreign policy in the Middle East that serves American rather than Israeli interests. It eliminates  any prospect of Americans escaping from their enculturation with Israeli propaganda.  To keep American minds captive, the Lobby is working to ban as anti-semitic any truth or disagreeable fact that pertains to Israel. It is permissible to criticize every other country in the world, but it is anti-semitic to criticize Israel, and anti-semitism will soon be a universal hate-crime in the Western world.  Most of Europe has already criminalized doubting the Holocaust.  It is a crime even to confirm that it happened but to conclude that less than 6 million Jews were murdered."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antony Lerman]] criticized the 2009 EISCA report, and claims that criminalizing criticism of Israel (particularly, comparing Israel actions to Nazi actions) would constitute an excessive infringement of freedom of speech in Britain, postulating, for example, that "if you said 'the way the IDF operated in Gaza was like the way the SS acted in Poland', and a Jew found this offensive, hurtful or harmful, you could, in theory, go to jail."&lt;ref&gt;Lerman, "Should We Ban..":
:"Using Nazi analogies to criticise Israel and Zionism is offensive, but should it be banned, criminalized or branded as antisemitic?  …   The authors of a new report, Understanding and Addressing the "Nazi Card": Intervening Against Antisemitic Discourse, from the European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism (EISCA), take a different line....   While the principle that freedom of speech is not absolute is accepted in English law, not all offensive speech is criminalized. So, merely showing that comparing Israeli behaviour to the Nazis is offensive is no reason to outlaw such discourse. The authors try to get round this by arguing that such comparisons are especially offensive to Jews, because of their history. They say: "Most people would accept that it's completely unacceptable to call a Jewish person a Nazi." The implication here – that it may, therefore, be acceptable in some circumstances to call a non-Jew a Nazi – is unfortunate to say the least. If one is against the use of Nazi comparisons in public debate, it's unacceptable to call anyone a Nazi. In which case, the argument of exceptional offensiveness for Jews doesn't hold.... The authors write: 'although the playing of the Nazi card is not always antisemitic, it unquestionably always harms'. As a result, where this occurs, it could already be defined as a criminal act, and if not, Iganski and Sweiry say, consideration should be given to changing the law so that it would be. In other words, if you said 'the way the IDF operated in Gaza was like the way the SS acted in Poland', and a Jew found this offensive, hurtful or harmful, you could, in theory, go to jail."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boycotts and divestment from Israel===
{{Further|Boycotts of Israel|Academic boycotts of Israel|Disinvestment from Israel|Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions}}
Boycotts of Israel are [[economy|economic]] and [[politics|political]] cultural campaigns or actions that seek a selective or total cutting of ties with the [[Israel|State of Israel]]. Such campaigns are employed by those who challenge the legitimacy of Israel, Israel's policies or actions towards the [[Palestinians]] over the course of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab–Israeli]] and [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], oppose Israeli territorial claims in the [[West Bank]] or [[Jerusalem]] or even oppose Israel's right to exist. Arab [[boycott]]s of [[Zionist]] institutions and [[Jew]]ish businesses began before Israel's founding as a state. An official boycott was adopted by the [[Arab League]] almost immediately after the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, but is not fully implemented in practice.

Similar boycotts have been proposed outside the [[Arab world]] and the [[Muslim world]]. These boycotts comprise economic measures such as [[divest]]ment; a consumer boycott of Israeli products or businesses that operate in Israel; a proposed [[Academic boycotts of Israel|academic boycott]] of [[List of universities in Israel|Israeli universities]] and scholars; and a proposed boycott of [[Culture of Israel|Israeli cultural institutions]] or [[Sport in Israel|Israeli sport venues]]. Many advocates of the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign]], including Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] use the 1980s [[anti-apartheid movement|movement against South African apartheid]] as a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bds-palestine.net/ |publisher=Palestine BDS Campaign |title=Palestinian Civil Society Calls for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel Until it Complies with International Law and Universal Principles of Human Rights |date=9 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disinvestment from Israel is a campaign conducted by religious and political entities which aims to use [[disinvestment]] to pressure the [[government of Israel]] to put "an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories captured during the 1967 military campaign."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;  The disinvestment campaign is related to other [[economic and political boycotts of Israel]]. A notable campaign was initiated in 2002 and endorsed by [[South Africa]]n bishop [[Desmond Tutu]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://newint.org/columns/viewfrom/2003/01/01/israel/ Israel: Time to Divest].

Txakartegi grew up hearing [[Biscayan]] and [[Gipuzkoan]] dialects of the [[Basque language]], fully embracing [[standard Basque|Batua]], the unified standard dialect, once it become codified. As a young man he studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]], hoping to be ordained as a [[priest]]. Instead, he received a degee in [[social economy]] from the [[University of Deusto]] in [[Bilbao]]. Later he migrated to the [[United States]], where he received his M.A. in [[French literature|French]] and [[Spanish literature]], and finally his Ph.D. in [[Basque Studies]] in 1987 at the [[University of Nevada, Reno]], with the thesis ''El bertsolarismo: literatura oral improvisada en el País Vasco.''

In the period 1980 - 1988 he acted as a lexicographer and an instructor in the Basque Studies Program, and the following year he finally became an [[assistant professor]]. From 1989 until 2000, when he retired, he taught literature in the Basque EUTG center ([[San Sebastián]]) at the University of Deusto. He is a corresponding member of the [[Euskaltzaindia]] since 1996, member of the committee on Basque literature.

He wrote 10 books, 91 articles, and numerous other publications such as conference papers and book reviews. He wrote the following books:
* ''Basque-English Dictionary'' (edit. University of Nevada-Press, 1989)
* ''English-Basque Dictionary'' (together with [[Linda White]], edit. University of Nevada Press, 1990)

[[Image:Leipzig Palais Roßbach.jpg|thumb|upright|Historicist building by [[Arwed Roßbach]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany (1892)]]
'''{{lang|de|Gründerzeit}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡʁʏndɐˌtsaɪt}}, literally: "founders' period") was the economic phase in 19th-century [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] before the great [[Panic of 1873|stock market crash of 1873]]. At this time in Central Europe the age of [[industrialisation]] was taking place, whose beginnings were found in the 1840s. This period is not precisely dated, but in Austria the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]] of 1848 is generally accepted as the beginning of economic changes, in contrast to political reforms. In Germany, as a consequence of the large influx of capital resulting from French [[war reparations]] from the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–1871, and the subsequent [[unification of Germany]], there followed an [[economic boom]], giving rise to the description of these years as the "founders' years".

These years in Central Europe were a time that citizens increasingly influenced cultural development. This was also the epoch of [[classical liberalism]], even if the political demands of the time were only partially met, and then only in the later period. Industrialisation also posed aesthetic challenges, above all in the fields of architecture and craftsmanship, through development of existing forms, rather than innovation as such.

In common parlance the term ''{{lang|de|Gründerzeitstil}}'' is often mingled with [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]], which was the predominant architectural style after 1850 until 1914, leading to a blurring of the terms. In historical context different decades are often also called ''Gründerzeit''. For this reason, the term ''Gründerzeit'' is used to refer to several periods; for example 1850–1873, 1871–1890, sometimes 1850–1914 in reference to the architecture, or just 1871–1873.

== Economy ==
[[File:Borsig 1847.jpg|thumb|Gründerzeit primarily refers to the [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] boom of late 19th-century Germany. Machine and [[railway locomotive|locomotive]] ironworks of ''[[August Borsig|Borsig]] AG'' in [[Berlin]]'s [[Feuerland]], 1847 painting by [[Karl Eduard Biermann]]]]
The German term ''{{lang|de|Gründerzeit}}'' refers to the great economic upswing in the mid-19th century, when the founders of business (''entrepreneurs, {{lang|de|Gründer}}'') could apparently become rich overnight. Of particular importance for speedy economic development was the rise of a developed railway system. Not only was it a major factor in its own right on the business scene of the time, but it also permitted further development through improved communication and migration. Rural migration to the cities assisted the development of a proletariat, with an attendant increase in social problems.

The stock market crash of 1873, combined with economic overheating due to enormous French reparations from the war, put an abrupt end to this upswing, referred to in German as the founders’ crisis (''{{lang|de|Gründerkrise}}''), resulting in a twenty-year period of economic stagnation. This crisis caused the theory of economic liberalism to lose ground, and it was also this time which saw the introduction of business control mechanisms, as well as protective customs tariffs.

The Vienna stock market crash led to the [[Panic of 1873]] in the United States, resulting in the [[Long Depression]].

== Design and architecture ==
{{Main|Historicism (art)}}
[[Image:Tenement Building Callinstrasse Hanover Germany.jpg|thumb|Historicist architecture at [[Hannover-Nordstadt|Nordstadt]] in [[Hanover]]]]
The need for housing rose in consequence of industrialisation. Complete housing developments in the so-called Founding Epoch Architecture style arose in previously green fields, and even today in Central European cities large numbers of buildings from this time can be found together along one single road or even in complete districts. These 4- to 6-story buildings, often constructed by private property developers, often sported richly decorated façades in the form of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] such as Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, German Renaissance and Baroque Revival. Not only magnificent palaces for nouveau-riche citizens were built, but also infamous rental housing for the expanding urban lower classes.

This phase was also important for the integration of new technologies in architecture and design. A determining factor was the development of the [[Bessemer process]] in steel production, which made possible the construction of steel façades. A classical example of this new form is the steel and glass construction of the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], completed in 1851, which was revolutionary for the time and an inspiration to subsequent decades.

== Gründerzeit in Austria ==
In Austria the Gründerzeit began after 1840 with the industrialisation of Vienna, as well as the regions of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]]. Liberalism reached its zenith in Austria in 1867 during the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and remained dominant until the mid-1870s.

Vienna, the capital and residence of Emperor Franz Joseph, after the failed uprising of 1848, became the fourth largest city in the world with the inclusion of suburbs and an influx of new residents from regions of Austria. In the place where the city wall had once stood, a [[Ringstraße|ring road]] was built, and ambitious civic buildings—including the [[Vienna State Opera|Opera House]], [[Rathaus, Vienna|Town Hall]], and [[Austrian Parliament Building|Parliament]]—were constructed. In contrast to agricultural workers and urban labourers, an increasingly wealthy upper-middle class built itself monuments and mansions. This occurred on a smaller scale in cities such as Graz, but on the periphery, thereby preserving the old city from destructive redevelopment.

== Gründerzeit in Germany ==
In the mindset of many Germans, the epoch is intrinsically linked with [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] and [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], but it did not end with them (in 1888/1890) but continued well into the reign of Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]]. It was a [[Golden Age]] for Germany in which the disasters of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] were remedied, and the country competed internationally on a world-class level in the domains of science, technology, industry and commerce. This was the time when particularly the German middle class rapidly increased their standard of living, buying modern furniture, kitchen fittings and household machines.

The social effects of Industrialization were the same as in other European nations: Increased agricultural efficiency and introduction of new agricultural machines led to a polarized distribution of income in the countryside. The landowners won out to the disadvantage of the agrarian [[proletariat|unpropertied workforce]]. Emigration, most of all to America, and urbanization were a consequence.

In the rapidly growing industrial cities, new workers' dwellings were erected, lacking in comfort by today's standards but also criticized as unhealthy by physicians of the time: "without light, air and sun", quite contrary to the then prevailing ideas on town planning. The dark, cramped flats took a large part of the blame for the marked increase in [[tuberculosis]], which spread also to wealthier neighborhoods.

Nevertheless, the working class also saw improvements of living standards and other conditions, such as [[social security]] through laws on workers' [[health insurance]] and [[accident insurance]] introduced by [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] in 1883/1884, and in the long run also through the foundation of a [[Social democracy|Social Democracy]] that would remain the model for the European sister parties until [[Hitler]]'s ''[[Machtübernahme]]'' in 1933. Even today the model of social care developed by Bismarck in 1873 ([[:de:Reichsversicherungsordnung|Reichsversicherungsordnung]]) remains the contractual basis for health insurance in Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15012">The '''history''' of '''[[Bashkortostan]]''' or '''Bashkiria''' covers the region in and around the [[Ural (region)|Southern Urals]], historically inhabited by [[Bashkirs]]. The region has been known by several names, including ''al-Bashgird'', ''Bashgirdia'', ''Bascardia'', ''Fiyafi Bashqyrt'' (The Bashqyrt steppes), ''Pascatir'' and similar variants. As with previous names, the modern [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of Bashkortostan was named after the native Bashkir people.

==Early history==
The first settlements in the territory of modern Bashkortostan were set up in the early [[Paleolithic]] period. Major expansion, however, occurred during the [[Bronze Age]] with the arrival of people from the [[Abashevo culture]]. They possessed skills in manufacturing bronze tools, weapons and decorations and they were the first to establish permanent settlements in the region.

The ethnonym ''Bashkirs'' first became known in the 7th century. According to Ibn Ruste, the Bashkirs were "an independent people, occupying territories on both sides of the [[Ural Mountains|Ural mountain]] ridge between [[Volga River|Volga]], [[Kama River|Kama]], [[Tobol River|Tobol]] and upstream of [[Ural River|Yaik river]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The earliest source to give a geographical description of the territory is [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]]'s ''Divanu Lugat’it Turk'' (1072–1074) which includes a map with a charted region called ''Fiyafi Bashqyrt'' (The Bashkir Steppes).&lt;ref&gt;Умняков И. И. Самая старая турецкая карта мира. Труды Самаркандского государственного педагогического института. 1940. Т.1, вып.1. с. 103—131 {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a lack of much geographic detail, the sketch map does indicate that the Bashkirs inhabited a territory bordering on the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Volga River|Volga]] valley in the West, the Ural Mountains in the North-West, and the [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]] valley in the East, thus giving a rough estimate of the area. Even earlier, in the 10th century, [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] mentions "the country ''al-Bashgird''" in his itinerary and enumerates the rivers he had to cross during his trip.&lt;ref&gt;Путешествие Ибн-Фадлана на Волгу. М.; Л., 1939. С. 66.; [http://www.hist.msu.ru/ER/Etext/fadlan.htm Ибн-Фадлан Ibn-Fadlan’s Volga trip report{{ref-ru}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early statehood==
No reliable data exists attesting to early Bashkir statehood in the Southern Urals.

However, works by [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan|ibn Fadlan]], [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine|Giovanni del Carpine]],&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni da Pian del Carpine. History of the Mongols Whom We Call the Tartars (1247).&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Rubruck]],&lt;ref&gt;The Journey of William of Rubruk to the Eastern Parts (London, 1900, {{ISBN|0-8115-0327-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Bashkir epic poetry and genealogies (''shejere'') suggest that an independent local governance had existed in the region before the 13th century.

When talking about this period, [[Sergei Rudenko]]&lt;ref&gt;Руденко С. И. Башкиры: Историко-этнографические очерки. — [[Уфа]]:[[Китап (издательство)|Китап]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; cites [[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi]]&lt;ref&gt;Abu Zayd al-Balkhi. Kitab-ul-Masalik-ul-Mumalik. Vol. I. Leiden, 1870. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; to state that the western parts of Bashkiria were part of and administered by Volga Bulgaria. Z.I. Enikeev references R.G. Kuzeev&lt;ref&gt;Башкирские шежере/ Сост. Р. Г. Кузеев. Уфа, 1960. С. 50-63, 166—173, 175—223&lt;/ref&gt; and states that "...The Bashkirs of the tribes ''bülär, yänäy, meñ'' and ''äyle'' wrote in their genealogies that the Bulgar khans ''Aidar, Säit, Ämir, Sälim, Ilham'' and ''Ğabdulla'' were their rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Еникеев З. И. Правовой статус Башкортостана в составе России: историко-правовое исследование. — Уфа: Гилем, 2002. 371 с. С.35.&lt;/ref&gt; Z.I. Enikeev also relies upon another work by R.G. Kuzeev&lt;ref&gt;Кузеев Р. Г. Происхождение башкирского народа. С. 261—265&lt;/ref&gt; to maintain that Tabyn Khanate, a strong Bashkir nationstate had existed within [[Cumania|Dasht-i Qipchaq]], the confederation of Turkic states, before the [[Mongol invasions|Mongol invasion]].

The Hungarian monk [[Friar Julian|Julian]] indicates in his itinerary that Bashkirs had their own ruler (''khan'') in 1235-1236.&lt;ref&gt;Аннинский С. А. Известия венгерских миссионеров XIII—XIV вв. о татарах в Восточной Европе // Исторический архив. Т. III. М.; Л., 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction of Islam==
[[Islam]] was introduced to the Baskirs by the [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga Bulgars]], who had adopted Islam in the 10th century.

One of the earliest remnants of the introduction of Islam is the historical site near Chishmy, [[Chishminsky District]]. The site contains a rock with an Arabic inscription saying that Husein-bek, the son of Izmer-bek, resides at the location, who died on the 7th day of the month [[Muharram]] in year 444 of [[Hijri year|Hijra]], i.e. 1066 AD.

Evidence also exists that Islam came to the Southern Urals from [[Middle Asia]]. For example, the 13th century burial site of two Muslim missionaries is preserved in the Bashkir Trans-Uralia, near the village of Starobairamgulovo, [[Uchalinsky District]].

==Mongol Empire==
In the 13th century, Historical Bashkortostan fell under the influence of the [[Mongol Empire]]. Some sources, including G.Carpine and I.Rudenko, report that Bashkortostan was conquered by Mongols after the fall of [[Volga Bulgaria]]. I. Rudenko believes Volga Bulgaria was conquered by Mongols in 1229, while in 1236 "...the entire Bashkiria was conquered..."  [[Lev Gumilev]] says, perhaps using Friar Julian’s report as his source, that "the war between Mongols and Bashkirs continued for 14 years... The Bashkirs won multiple battles and, after all, concluded a treaty of friendship and cooperation, after which the Mongols forged an alliance with the Bashkirs for further conquests...".&lt;ref&gt;Гумилев Л. Н. Древняя Русь и Великая Степь. С. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, this happened in 1220-1223.

In Z.I. Enikeev’s view, these two statements do not conflict each other. Those Bashkir tribes which were previously controlled by Volga Bulgaria, had to declare themselves dependents of the Mongol Empire after the fall of [[Bilär]]. However, the bulk of the Bashkir tribes, headed at that time by Muyten-biy, voluntarily entered the Mongol Empire.

The authors of the "History of Bashkortostan" maintain that the Bashkirs entered the Mongol State in 1207 or 1208, suggesting that "the entrance was both promoted by coercion and, at the same time, a voluntary act of recognition". In this respect, it is important to cite [[German Fedorov-Davydov]]’s opinion, who was an outstanding historian of the [[Golden Horde]]. When speaking of the fact that the Bashkirs had their own khan ruling over them, he pointed out that this was a special privilege granted to the Bashkirs as they willfully accepted the Mongol rule; normally, the Mongols would never keep alive the former rulers of the nations they conquered by force.&lt;ref&gt;История Башкортостана с древнейших времен до наших дней: В 2 т. / И. Г. Акманов, Н. М. Кулбахтин, А. З. Асфандияров, и др.; Под ред. И. Г. Акманова. Т.1. История Башкортостана с древнейших времен до конца XIX в. — Уфа:Китап, 2004. — 488 с.: ил. — С.66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very fact that the Bashkirs, as an individual nation, survived while the Mongols exterminated many other peoples who had lived in the adjacency, suggests that special relations existed between the conquerors and the medieval Bashkirs.

By 1294, though, the Mongol Empire had fractured, leaving the Bashkirs under the authority of the [[Golden Horde]], one of the Mongol successor states.

==Russian Empire==
After the Golden Horde, too, had broken apart, the territory of modern Bashkortostan was divided between the khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Khanate of Sibir|Sibir]] and the [[Nogai Horde]].

After [[Kazan]] [[Siege of Kazan|fell]] to [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] in October 1552, the Bashkirs joined the Russian Empire. Whether this was voluntary or the result of conquest is still debated.

===Accession by negotiation===
According to one version, after Ivan's victory over Kazan, the Russian government appealed to the peoples of the khanate, including the western Bashkirs who had been subjects of the [[Kazan Khanate]], to become subjects of the Russian tsar. The neighboring [[Nogai Horde]] at that time was stricken with internecine dissention, unrest and famine. Most its population had migrated to the southern steppes and abandoned their camps; however, the danger of Nogai raids remained. The western Bashkirs became subjects of the Russian empire, and received credentials from the tsar confirming their patrimonial rights to their traditional lands as well as to the abandoned Nogai camps.

[[File:P1010015 Вензель на стелле Монумента дружбы в городе Уфа.jpg|thumb|Annexation commemoration]]
As attested in the Bashkir legends, the negotiations with the Russian government’s representatives were preceded by Bashkir nationwide meetings at which the annexation terms and conditions were discussed, alongside with who should be sent to "the White Padishah" as Bashkir delegates.

[[Land patent|Patents]] were received from the Russian government which provided detailed description of the annexation terms, defined the land allotments and the taxes; the received patents were then again discussed at nationwide assemblies.

The annexation negotiations were expedited by the fact that [[Kalmuck]]s and later [[Kazakhs]] began laying claims on the Bashkirs’ lands. In 1555–[1557], Bashkir councils in central and southern Bashkortostan sent their delegations to Kazan asking the Russian tsar to take them under his protection and patronage. The Bashkir ''shejere'' kept the names of the four ''biys'' (noblemen) who traveled to Kazan for negotiations: ''Tatagach-biy'' (the tribe of ''[[Yurmaty]]''), ''Buranqul-biy'' (the tribe of ''[[Burzyan]]''), ''Krakujak-biy'' (the tribe of ''[[Qypchaq]]''),  and ''Qanzafar-biy'' (the tribe of ''Meñ'').

The negotiations between the Bashkir noblemen and the Russian tsar's representatives are also attested in the Russian chronicles and testimonies left by the contemporaries. By accepting the Russian citizenship, the Bashkirs confirmed their patrimonial rights to the land, and ensured protection from the Nogay trespassers.

===Accession by conquest===
Meanwhile, an alternative viewpoint exists, primarily in Western historiography, which maintains that Bashkortostan never joined the Russian Empire of its own volition, but was conquered.

This viewpoint is spearheaded by the American historian Alton S. Donnelly,&lt;ref&gt;Donelly S. Alton. The Russian Conquest of Bashkiria 1552-1740. Yale University Press, 1968. {{ISBN|0-300-00430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; who analysed the factors of Bashkir’s joining the Russian Empire and concluded that Bashkortostan was in fact conquered by the Russians and converted into Russia’s internal colony. Donnelly studied tsarist policy adopted after the Bashkirs entered the Russian Empire, and emphasised the fact that the [[Bashkir rebellion (1662–64)]] and [[Bashkir Uprising (1704–11)]] were primarily caused by the Russian government’s violations of the terms and conditions previously agreed between the Bashkirs and the Russian authorities. From this, Alton Donelly concludes that Russia pursued an "imperialistic" policy in the newly joined Bashkortostan and included a consistent infringement of the Bashkirs’ interests.

Russian historians also state that the Bashkir riots were primarily caused by the fact that the Russian government violated the conditions under which Bashkortostan joined the Russian Empire. However, they maintain that this fact cannot give ground to re-evaluations of the accession’s circumstances: its free-will basis is attested by both Russian and Bashkir historical sources.

===Growth within the Russian Empire===
Starting from the second half of the 16th century, Bashkiria's territory began taking shape as a part of the Russian state. In 1798 the Spiritual Assembly of Russian Muslims was established; an indication that the imperial government recognised the rights of [[Bashkirs]], [[Tatars]], and other Muslim nations to profess Islam and perform religious rituals. [[Ufa Governorate]], centred at [[Ufa]], was formed in 1865: another step towards territorial identification.

==Soviet era==
After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] ([[Autonomous republics of the Soviet Union|ASSR]]) was established, firstly as Little Bashkortostan, but eventually all of [[Ufa Governorate]] was incorporated into the newly established republic. During the Soviet period, Bashkiria was granted broad autonomous rights- the first among other Russian regions. The administrative structure of the Bashkir ASSR was based on principles similar to those of other autonomous republics of Russia.

The extraction of crude oil in Bashkiria began in 1932. At the end of 1943, large crude oil deposits were discovered. During [[World War II]], Bashkiria became one of the major regions of the [[Soviet Union]] to accommodate plants and factories evacuated from Western Russia, as well as great masses of people, as well as providing the country with weaponry, fuel, and foodstuffs. After the war, a good number of industries were further developed there, such as mining, machine construction and, especially, oil-refining. Bashkiria's industry became a solid base for the further economic growth of all European outlying territories of Russia.

==Modern Bashkortostan==
On October 11, 1990 the Supreme Soviet of the Republic adopted the Declaration on State Sovereignty of the Bashkir ASSR. On February 25, 1992 the Bashkir ASSR was renamed the Republic of Bashkortostan.

On March 31, 1992 a Federative Compact "On separation of authorities and powers among federal organs of power of the Russian Federation and the organs of power of the Republic of Bashkortostan" was signed. On August 3, 1994 a Compact "On separation of authorities and mutual delegating of powers among the organs of power of the Russian Federation and the organs of power of the Republic of Bashkortostan" was signed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13282">[[Ethics]] is the branch of [[philosophy]] that examines right and wrong [[morality|moral]] behavior, moral concepts (such as justice, virtue, duty) and moral language. Various ethical theories pose various answers to the question "What is the greatest good?" and elaborate a complete set of proper behaviors for individuals and groups. Ethical theories are closely related to forms of life in various social orders.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre's Short History of Ethics"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alistair|title=A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the 20th Century|year=1998|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The epic poems that stand at the beginning of many world literatures, such as the Mesopotamian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], Homer's [[Iliad]] and the Icelandic [[Eddas]], portray a set of values that suit the strong leader of a small tribe. Valour and success are the principal qualities of a hero, and are generally not constrained by moral considerations. Revenge and vendetta are appropriate activities for heroes. The gods that appear in such epics are not defenders of moral values but are capricious forces of nature, and are to be feared and propitiated.&lt;ref&gt;T. Cahill, ''The Gifts of the Jews'' (New York, 1998), ch. 1; A. W. H. Adkins, ''Merit and Responsibility: A Study in Greek Values'' (Oxford, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

More strictly ethical claims are found occasionally in the literature of ancient civilizations that is aimed at lower classes of society. The [[Sumerian Farmer's Almanac]] and the Egyptian [[Instruction of Amenhotep]] both advise farmers to leave some grain for poor gleaners, and promise favours from the gods for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Kramer, ''The Sumerians'' (Chicago, 1963), 108.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ancient religions and ethical thinkers also put forward some version of the [[golden rule]], at least in its negative version: do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.&lt;ref&gt;J. Wattles, ''The Golden Rule'' (New York, 1996), ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish ethics==
{{Further|Jewish ethics|Jewish philosophy}}

Since the origin of [[Ethical Monotheism]] in (Hebrew) Judaism, something Greek-sounding like "ethics" may be said to have been originated in Judaism's up to four thousand years old passed down traditions and instructions of the Torahs (Hebrew: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɔː|r|ɔː|t|}}, ''toroth''; plural of Torah), [[Oral Torah|Oral]], [[Written Torah|Written]],&lt;ref name="Jewish Concepts 1964, page 630"&gt;Birnbaum (1979), p. 630&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kabbalah|Mystical]].

==Ancient Greek ethics==
[[Socrates]], as portrayed in [[Plato]]'s ''Republic'', articulates the greatest good as the transcendent "form of good itself".&lt;ref&gt;Republic, Book VI&lt;/ref&gt; The good, Socrates says, is like the sun. The sun gives light and life to the earth, the good gives knowledge and virtue to the intelligible world.  It is the cause of goodness in people and actions, and it also is the cause of existence and knowledge. The pursuit of and love of the good itself (rather than any particular good thing) Socrates thought was the chief aim of education and (especially) of philosophy.

In his personal life, Socrates lived extremely morally. He was chaste, disciplined, pious, responsible, and cared for his friends&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Symposium, Phaedo, and Republic, Book I&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]] he defends the notion that it is better to suffer injustice than to do it. The Greeks found this paradoxical, but Socrates both argued and lived this philosophy consistently. That is because the doing of evil damages the soul, which is the highest part of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Gorgias'' 475e.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic, Socrates is challenged to defend the view that we have reasons to be moral that do not come from rational self-interest, in response to Glaucon's arguments in Book 2. The Republic develops the view that being a good person in an ethical sense involves achieving internal harmony of the parts of the soul. However, Plato's ethical ideal, as expressed in the [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], still has much in common with the Homeric conception of the leader of a tribe or city: the successful running of the city and the internal harmony of the citizen who runs it is the main ethical aim, and there is little mention in Plato of any strictly moral obligations the ruler may be under.

[[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotle's ethics]] builds upon Plato's with important variations. Aristotle's highest good was not the good itself but goodness embodied in a flourishing human life. His ethics are based on ''eudaimonia'', variously translated as "happiness," "prosperity," "flourishing," or "success." A "great-souled" citizen who lives a life of virtue can expect to achieve ''eudaimonia'', which Aristotle argues is the highest good for man. Following Plato, Aristotle gives a significant role in moral life the [[virtues]], fixed habits of behavior that lead to good outcomes; the main virtues are [[courage]], [[justice]], [[prudence]] and [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]]. The highest form of life is, however, purely intellectual activity.&lt;ref&gt;J. O. Urmson, ''Aristotle's Ethics'' (New York, 1988.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Greek schools of philosophy, such as the [[Epicureans]] and [[Stoics]], debated the conditions of the good life. Epicurus taught that the greatest good was pleasure and freedom from pain. The Epicureans emphasized the quiet enjoyment of pleasures, especially mental pleasure, free of fear and anxiety. The Stoics thought the greatest good not pleasure but reason and everything in accord with reason, even if painful. Hence they praised the life of reason lived in accordance with nature.&lt;ref&gt;W. O. Stephens, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/ Stoic ethics] in ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A theme of Ancient Greek ethics then is the role of the virtuous life in achieving eudaimonia, or the good life; and Aristotle, Epicurus and the Stoics all argued that virtue was necessary for happiness, albeit in different ways and with different conceptions of those terms.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Annas, ''The Morality of Happiness''. Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian ethics==
A passage of the [[Torah]], "[[Golden Rule#Judaism|Love your neighbour as yourself]]"&lt;ref name="njps"&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=Jewish Publication Society 1917|book=Leviticus|chapter=19|verse=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up by the writers of the [[New Testament]] and made part of the theological centerpiece of Christian ethical stance. In the New Testament Jesus teaches that all the commandments of [[Halakha|Jewish religious law]] could be summarized in the two rules, "[[Great Commandment|Love God and love your neighbour]]" (Mark 12:28-31). This is illustrated with the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], which praises action to help any human in need.

==Natural law ethics==
{{Main|Natural law}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed a synthesis of Biblical and Aristotelian ethics called [[natural law]] theory, according to which the nature of humans determines what is right and wrong. For example, murder is wrong because life is essential to humans so depriving someone of it is inherently an evil. Education is needed for humans, and is their right, because their intellectual nature requires developing. Natural law theory remains at the heart of Catholic moral teaching, for example in its positions on [[contraception]] and other controversial moral issues.&lt;ref&gt;J. Finnis, ''Fundamentals of Ethics'' (Oxford, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic practice of compulsory [[Confession (religion)|confession]] led to the development of manuals of [[casuistry]], the application of ethical principles to detailed cases of conscience, such as the conditions of a [[just war theory|just war]].&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Jonsen and S. Toulmin, ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'', Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kantian ethics==
{{main|Kantian ethics}}
[[Immanuel Kant]], in the 18th century, argued that right and wrong are founded on [[duty]], which issues a [[Categorical Imperative]] to us, a command that, of its nature, ought to be obeyed. An action is only truly moral if done from a sense of duty, and the most valuable thing is a human will that has decided to act rightly. To decide what duty requires, Kant proposes the principle of [[universalizability]]: correct moral rules are those everyone could adopt.&lt;ref&gt;R. Johnson, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/ Kant's moral philosophy] (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's philosophy marks a number of important conceptual shifts in philosophical thinking about ethics. Kant argues that questions about happiness should not be a focus in ethical thought, because ethics should be universal while happiness may involve very different modes of life for different individuals. He also believed this approach was necessary if an ethical theory was to avoid becoming 'heteronomous'; that is, locating the source of proper moral motivation outside of properly moral concerns.

==Utilitarianism==
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
In 19th century Britain, [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated [[utilitarianism]], the view that right actions are those that are likely to result in the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Utilitarianism remains popular in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. P. Singer, ''Practical Ethics'' (2nd ed, Cambridge, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Kantianism and Utilitarianism provide ethical theories that can support contemporary liberal political developments, and associated enlightenment ways of conceiving of the individual.

==Twentieth century==
The early twentieth century saw many debates on [[metaethics]], that is, philosophical theory on the nature of ethics. Views ranged from [[moral realism]], which holds that moral truths are about mind-independent realities,&lt;ref&gt;R. Shafer-Landau, ''Moral Realism: A Defence'' (Oxford, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; to [[evolutionary ethics]], which believes ethical practices are merely evolved ways of behavior that led to evolutionary success, to the [[error theory]] of [[J. L. Mackie]], which held that the entire notion of ethical obligation is a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mackie, ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (New York, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflections on the [[Holocaust]], such as those of [[Hannah Arendt]], led to a deepening appreciation of the reality of extreme evil. Also in reaction to the Holocaust, [[rights]] theories, as expressed for example in the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], asserted the inalienable moral rights of humans to life, education, and other basic goods. Another response to the atrocities of World War II included existential reflections on the meaning of life, leading to approaches to ethics based on "the situation" and personal interaction.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Simone de Beauvoir, ''The Ethics of Ambiguity''. Citadel, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s saw the revival of casuistry in the form of [[applied ethics]], the consideration of detailed practical cases in [[bioethics]],&lt;ref&gt;R.

'''Jacek Jędruch''' ([[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], 1927 &amp;ndash; [[Athens]], [[Greece]], 1995) was a Polish-American [[nuclear engineer]] and [[historian]] of [[Poland|Polish]] [[representative government]].

==Life==
During [[World War II]], Jędruch participated in the Polish [[World War II#Resistance|Resistance]] movement.  After the war, he escaped communist security forces by making his way to the West. He traveled to [[England]] and from there emigrated to the [[United States]].

He earned degrees from [[Northwestern University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Pennsylvania State University]].

While his vocation was [[nuclear technology]], his [[avocation]] was the study of representative governments, the evolution of government policy in relation to public needs, and political developments in [[Central Europe]].  This combination of interests prompted him to write a guide to Polish [[Sejm|parliament]]ary history (first edition 1982, second edition 1997).

He was at work on the second edition when in March 1995, while traveling in [[Greece]] with his wife Ewa, a [[chemical engineer]], he suffered a fatal accident at the [[Acropolis]] in [[Athens]]. Working from Jędruch's notes, his wife Ewa completed the second edition of his book.

The '''Luxembourg City History Museum''', {{lang-fr|Musée d'histoire de la Ville de Luxembourg}},  illustrates the thousand-year history of the [[Luxembourg (city)|City of Luxembourg]] with both permanent and temporary exhibits. Founded on 22 June 1996, it was designed by [[Luxembourg]] architect [[Conny Lentz]] and ''Repérages'', Paris.&lt;ref&gt;"Musée d'histoire de la Ville de Luxembourg", ''Luxemburger Lexikon'', Editions Guy Binsfeld, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="musee-hist"&gt;[http://www.musee-hist.lu/en/MUSEUM.html "Musée d'histoire de la Ville de Luxembourg"]. Retrieved 22 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The museum==

Like the city itself, the museum successfully combines ancient architecture with modern extensions. It is housed in four restored houses from the 17th to the 19th century which still bear archeological traces from the [[Middle Ages]]. Examples of how to combine old buildings with the expectations of museum visitors are the floating glass façade and the panoramic lift which offers extensive views of all floors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/museums/full-museum-details/profile/ac_id/889 "Profile - Luxembourg City History Museum"], ''Saatchi Online''. Retrieved 22 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The huge glass cage of the lift gives up to 65 people views of the rock foundations on the lower levels as well as views of the city's Grund district and Rham plateau on the upper levels, revealing the stages of Luxembourg's history over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-hist.lu/en/ARCHITECTURE.html "Architecture"], ''Musée d'histoire de la Ville de Luxembourg''. Retrieved 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Also of interest are the ancient, vaulted cellars which were discovered during excavation work in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="manifesta"&gt;[http://www.manifesta.org/manifesta2/f/venues.html "Sites d'exposition"], ''Manifesta 2''. {{Fr icon}} Retrieved 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The floors below the street level entrance house a permanent collection illustrating the town's architectural and urban development while the upper floors are reserved for temporary exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture-routes.lu/php/fo_index.php?lng=en&amp;dest=bd_or_det&amp;id=00000050&amp;PHPSESSID=50595b6bdb267435937ede3008084d85 "Musée d'histoire de la Ville de Luxembourg"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719154643/http://www.culture-routes.lu/php/fo_index.php?lng=en&amp;dest=bd_or_det&amp;id=00000050&amp;PHPSESSID=50595b6bdb267435937ede3008084d85 |date=2011-07-19 }}, ''European Institute of Cultural Routes''. Retrieved 22 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A multimedia system extending throughout the building documents the history of the town including its cultural, political and social development. It provides access to some ten thousand documents and almost sixty audio-visual sequences.&lt;ref name="manifesta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxembourg.co.uk/museums.html "Museums in Luxembourg"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124233618/http://luxembourg.co.uk/museums.html |date=2010-11-24 }}, ''Luxembourg Tourist Office, London''.

'''Michael Baigent''' (born '''Michael Barry Meehan''',&lt;ref&gt;Obituaries, page 15, ''The Bulletin, The Magazine of the Nelson College Community'', December 2013 [http://www.nelsoncollege.school.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/66141-Nelson-College-Bulletin-Dec-2013-WEB.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 27 February 1948 – 17 June 2013) was an [[author]] and speculative theorist who co-wrote a number of books that question mainstream perceptions of [[history]] and the [[Historical Jesus|life of Jesus]]. He is best known as co-writer of the book ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]''.

==Biography==
Baigent was born in 1948 in [[Nelson, New Zealand]]&lt;ref name="NZHerald obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10891959|title=NZ author dies of brain haemorrhage|date=21 June 2013| work= New Zealand Herald|accessdate=30 June 2013|first=Morgan|last=Tait}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in the nearby communities of [[Motueka]] and [[Wakefield, New Zealand|Wakefield]]. His upbringing was [[Catholic]], and he attended church three times a week, as well as being tutored in Catholic [[theology]] from the age of five years. His father left the family when he was eight years old and with his mother Jean, Baigent went to live with his maternal grandfather, Lewis Baigent, a sawmill owner, and took his surname.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/30/michael-baigent Michael Baigent Obituary, ''The Guardian'', 30 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; His great-grandfather, [[Henry Baigent]], had founded a [[forestry]] firm, "H. Baigent and Sons".

His secondary schooling was at [[Nelson College]], and then he moved on to the [[University of Canterbury]], [[Christchurch]], initially intending to study science and continue in the family career of forestry, but then switched to studying comparative religion and philosophy, studying [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Christianity]]. He travelled to [[Australia]] and Southeast [[Asia]], occasionally living on the street. He then returned to [[Auckland]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[Psychology]].

Baigent worked briefly at the [[BBC]] photographic department, and worked night shifts at a soft-drink factory. Later in life, Baigent earned an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Mysticism and Religious Experience at the [[University of Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/428/Michael_Baigent/index.aspx?authorID=428 Michael Baigent from HarperCollins Publishers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and a Grand Officer of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]], he was editor of ''Freemasonry Today'' from April 2001 (deputy editor Matthew Scanlan), which he used as a platform for a more liberal approach to Freemasonry.&lt;ref name="FToday"&gt;''Michael Baigent, editor of ''Freemasonry Today'', said he had always felt odd "meeting with friends dressed as though I am attending a funeral". Referring to the origins of the black tie tradition, he added: "This period of mourning became enshrined in tradition, and we have mourned ever since."'' [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/04/13/nmas13.xml Masons end their black tie affair]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a trustee of the Canonbury Masonic Research Centre.&lt;ref name="FT obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.freemasonrytoday.com/ugle-sgc/ugle/item/1047-michael-baigent-obituary-john-hamill|title=Michael Baigent obituary|date=5 September 2013 | work=Freemasonry Today | accessdate=24 November 2013 | first=John| last=Hamill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baigent lived in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] with his wife, Jane, with whom he had two daughters, Isabelle and Tansy. He died from a [[Cerebral hemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]] in [[Brighton]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="FT obit"/&gt;

==''Holy Blood, Holy Grail''==
In 1976, Baigent moved to the [[UK]], where he met [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]], the man who was to be his roommate and frequent co-author. Leigh introduced him to the alleged mystery of [[Rennes-le-Château]] in [[France]], and Baigent launched into research on the matter. In the same decade, Leigh introduced him to [[Henry Lincoln]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] television scriptwriter, while Lincoln was lecturing at a summer school. The three discovered that they shared an interest in the [[Knights Templar]], and took their Jesus bloodline theory on the road during the 1970s, in a series of lectures which later developed into the 1982 book, ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]''.

Published on 18 January 1982, ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail'' popularised the hypothesis that the true nature of the quest for the [[Holy Grail]] was that [[Jesus]] and [[Mary Magdalene]] had a child together, the first of a bloodline which later married into a Frankish royal dynasty, the [[Merovingians]], and was all tied together by a society known as the [[Priory of Sion]]. These ideas were later used as a basis for [[Dan Brown]]'s international bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.

The theory that Jesus and Mary were in a carnal (physical) relationship is based on Baigent's interpretation of the Holy Kiss on the mouth (typically between males in early Christian times, thus signifying Mary's emancipation), and ''spiritual marriage'', as given in the [[Gospel of Philip]]. The theory was perpetuated by authors [[Laurence Gardner]] and [[Margaret Starbird]].

The day after the publication the authors had a public clash on [[BBC]] television with the [[Bishop of Birmingham]] and [[Marina Warner]].&lt;ref name="bishbirm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/6/story.cfm?c_id=18&amp;objectid=10372236 |title=The Kiwi trying to break the Code |author=Milne, Jonathan |date=12 March 2006 |work=[[Herald on Sunday]] |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book rapidly climbed the bestseller charts, and had a sequel, ''The Messianic Legacy''.

The book has been described as "a work thoroughly debunked by scholars and critics alike"&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Sherr Sklar, Donald L. Hoffman (editors), ''King Arthur In Popular Culture'', page 214 (McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 2002). {{ISBN|0-7864-1257-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was called "one of the all-time great works of pop pseudohistory" in a review in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Laura|title=The Da Vinci Con|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/22/books/the-last-word-the-da-vinci-con.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthurian scholar [[Richard Barber]] has commented, "It would take a book as long as the original to refute and dissect ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail'' point by point: it is essentially a text which proceeds by innuendo, not by refutable scholarly debate".&lt;ref&gt;cited in Richard Barber, "The Search for Sources: The Case of the Grail", in [[Norris J. Lacy]], editor, ''A History of Arthurian Scholarship'', page 34 ([[Boydell &amp; Brewer|D. S. Brewer]], 2006). {{ISBN|978-1-84384-069-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, he and Leigh co-authored several books, including ''[[The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception]]'' (1991) in which they primarily followed the controversial theories of [[Robert Eisenman]] concerning the interpretation of the Scrolls. This was discredited by Otto Betz and Rainer Riesner in their book ''Jesus, Qumran and The Vatican: Clarifications'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;London: SCM Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dan Brown lawsuit==
Some of the ideas presented in Baigent's earlier book ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]'', were incorporated in the bestselling American novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', by [[Dan Brown]].&lt;ref name="stuff2"&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3588181a10,00.html NZ author claims copyright breach in Da Vinci Code]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 28 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Da Vinci Code'', Dan Brown named the primary antagonist, a British Royal Historian, Knight of the Realm and Grail scholar, [[Sir Leigh Teabing]], KBE, also known as the Teacher, in homage to the  authors of ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail''.  The name combines Richard Leigh's surname with 'Teabing', an anagram of Baigent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/arts/michael-baigent-writer-who-sued-over-da-vinci-code-dies-at-65.html?_r=0|title=Michael Baigent, Writer Who Sued Over ‘Da Vinci Code,’ Dies at 65|date=22 June 2013|last=Slotnik|first=Daniel|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Baigent and Leigh filed a lawsuit in a [[United Kingdom|British]] court against Brown's publisher, [[Random House]], claiming [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3588485a1860,00.html Kiwi author takes on Dan Brown]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 1 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrent with the plagiarism trial, Baigent released a new book, ''[[The Jesus Papers]]'', amid criticism that it was just a reworking of themes from ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail'', and timed to capitalize on the marketing hype around the release of the movie ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'', as well as the attention brought by the trial. In the postscript to the book (p.&amp;nbsp;355), Baigent points out that the release date had been set by Harper Collins long before.

On 7 April 2006, [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge [[Peter Smith (judge)|Peter Smith]] rejected the copyright-infringement claim by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, and [[Dan Brown]] won the court case.  On 28 March 2007, Baigent and Leigh lost their appeal against this decision and were faced with legal bills of about 3 million pounds.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://books.guardian.co.uk/danbrown/story/0,,2044644,00.html Guardian article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Baigent's interpretations of history sometimes attracted hostile criticisms from scholars and historians. For example, Bernard Hamilton, writing in the ''[[English Historical Review]]'' (Vol. 116, No. 466 (Apr., 2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;474–475) described Baigent's treatment of The Inquisition in his 1999 book of the same name (with Richard Leigh) as pursuing "a very outdated and misleading account of this institution [the Inquisition]". In a review in the ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' magazine (8 January 2000), reviewer Piers Paul Read said the authors: "show no interest in understanding the subtleties and paradoxes in the history of the Inquisition".&lt;ref&gt;see [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200001/ai_n8899834/pg_1 review] {{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baigent himself conceded that none of his theories yielded any positive results: "I would like to think in due course a lot of this material will be proven," he said, "but it’s just a hope of mine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.com/id/12255363#.VKd2r4rF9XY DaVinci, other books fit conspiracy fixation]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6100">'''Michael Lort''' (1725–1790) was a Welsh clergyman, academic and antiquary.

==Life==

The descendant of a [[Pembrokeshire]] family living at [[Prickeston]], he was eldest son of Roger Lort, major of the [[Royal Welsh Fusiliers]], who married Anne, only child of Edward Jenkins, vicar of [[Fareham]], [[Hampshire]]. His father died at [[Cambrai]], 11 May 1745, aged 51, from wounds received at the [[battle of Fontenoy]]; his mother died in 1767, aged 69, and in 1778 he erected a monument to their memory, now on the east wall of the chapel of St. Ann in Tenby Church.

He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on 13 June 1743, when he was described as aged 18 and as coming from [[Tenby]] school. [[William Cole (antiquary)|William Cole]] adds that he was at [[Westminster School]]. His degrees at Cambridge were, B.A. 1746, M.A. 1750, B.D. 1761, and D.D. 1780. He was incorporated at Oxford 7 July 1759.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|LRT743M|Lort, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; His college offices were: scholar 20 April 1744, sub-fellow 2 Oct. 1749, full fellow 4 July 1750, senior fellow 1768, sublector primus 1753, Latin reader 1754, lector primarius 1755, and Greek reader 1756. On graduating in 1746, Lort acted as librarian to [[Richard Mead]] until 1754.

His preferments were numerous, but for many years not very lucrative. From 1759 to 1771 he held the post of [[Regius Professor of Greek (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Greek]] at Cambridge, and in 1768 he applied for the professorship of modern history, when [[Thomas Gray]] was given the chair. In 1761 he was appointed chaplain to [[Richard Terrick]], [[bishop of Peterborough]], and about that date he served the vicarage of [[Bottisham]], near Cambridge. From 1779 to 1783 he lived at [[Lambeth Palace]] as domestic chaplain to Archbishop [[Frederick Cornwallis]]. He was promoted to be librarian at Lambeth in 1785, and he is said to have been librarian to the [[Duke of Devonshire]]. In January 1771 he became rector of [[St. Matthew, Friday Street]], London. On 11 April 1780 he was collated to the prebendal stall of Tottenhall in [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] (which caused him to vacate his fellowship at Trinity College on Lady day 1781); he obtained in 1789 the rectory of St. Michael, Mile End, adjoining [[Colchester]]; and Bishop [[Beilby Porteus]] gave him in April 1789 the sinecure rectory of [[Fulham]].

Lort was elected [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries]] in 1755, remaining a vice-president until 1788, and became [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1766. While driving down North Hill, Colchester, in August 1790, Lort was thrown out of his carriage, and he died from the effects of the accident at 6 [[Savile Row]], London, 5 November 1790. He had married, in May 1783, Susannah Norfolk one of the two daughters of Alderman Norfolk of Cambridge. She died on 5 February 1792, aged 50, and was buried in the same vault with her husband in the church of Friday Street, a white marble tablet being placed on its north wall. On the demolition of the building the remains were removed in 1883 to the City of London cemetery at Ilford.

==Works==

He published little, but helped others. He printed a couple of sermons (1760 and 1770), edited in 1769 ''A Projecte conteyning the State of Governmente of the University of Cambridge, in the 43d year of the raigne of Queen Elizabeth'', in 1785 had ‘a copy of the Alexandrian New Testament printed off on fine vellum,’ and in 1790 published ''A Short Commentary on the Lord's Prayer'', from which [[Granville Sharp]] in 1806 took the observations on the last two petitions as an appendix to his own work on that subject. [[John Carter (draughtsman)|John Carter]] the architect obtained his ‘first insight and encouragement’ from him.

Some of his manuscript lives were used by [[Alexander Chalmers]] in his ''Biographical Dictionary''. [[James Granger]] obtained his aid in his portrait-dictionary, he assisted [[John Bowyer Nichols|John Nichols]] in the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' and in other undertakings, and he contributed to ''Archæologia''. Letters to and from him and Cole, [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]], and [[Horace Walpole]] are in Nichols's ''Literary Anecdotes'', and ''Illustrations of Literary History'', and there are some letters and notes from him in Granger's ''Letters''.

Lort's English verses from the ''Gratulatio Academiæ Cantabrigiensis'', 1748, on the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]], are reprinted in Nichols's ''Collection of Poems'', and another English poem by him is in [[Thomas Zouch]]'s ''Works''. The Greek verses in four collections of the University of Cambridge (1760–63) which bear Lort's name are reprinted in Zouch's ''Works'' (by whom it appears that they were written). His notes on the authorship of the ''[[Whole Duty of Man]]'' are in Nichols's ''Literary Anecdotes'', and his vindication of [[Horace Walpole]] with respect to [[Thomas Chatterton]] is in the ''Illustrations of Literary History''.

His books were sold from 5 April to 14 May 1791, and produced £1,269, and his prints, which were disposed of on 26 May and six following days, fetched £401.

'''Mohammed al-Mahdi al-Fasi''' also known as Abu Isa Abu Abdallah Mohammed al-Mahdi ibn Ahmad ibn Ali ibn Yusuf al-Fihri al-Fasi was a well-known mystic, biographer and historian from [[Fes]]. He was born in [[Ksar-el-Kebir|Ksar al-Kebir]] on May 17, 1624&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Lakhdar, ''La Vie Littéraire au Maroc sous la dynastie alawite (1075/1311/1664-1894)''. Rabat: Ed. Techniques Nord-Africaines, 1971, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; and died 20 February 1698. He was buried in the mausoleum of his great grandfather [[Abu l-Mahasin Yusuf al-Fasi]].

He was the author of the following works on mysticism:
*Three commentaries on the ''[[Dala'il al-Khayrat]]''
*''Mumti al-asma fi dhikr al-Jazuli wa at-Tabba'a wa ma lahuma min al-atba'' (on [[Muhammad al-Jazuli]] and [[Abdelaziz al-Tebaa]])
*''Al-Ilma bi-bad man lam yudkar fi-Mumti al-asma''
Mohammed al-Mahdi was particularly interested in the history of mysticism in Morocco since [[Muhammad al-Jazuli|Mohammed al-Jazuli]] and his pupil [[Abdelaziz al-Tebaa|al-Tabba]] up to the end of the 17th century. Parallel to that history he retraces the development of the Sadilite school and its affiliate founded by [[Ahmad Zarruq|Ahmed Zarruq]].

Al-Mahdi wrote the following biographical works, on his great grandfather [[Abu l-Mahasin Yusuf al-Fasi]]:
*''Al-Gawahir as-Safiyya min al-Mahasin al-Yusufiyya'' 
*''Rawdat al-mahasin az-zahiyya bi-maatir as-Sayh Abi-l-Mahsin al-Bahiyya''

On the traditions of the people of [[Fes]] he wrote:
*''Al-Arf al-asi fi-l-urf al-Fasi''

Ross Parker was born in Peterborough in 1984 to Davinia and Tony Parker.

He was nicknamed [[Pint|"Half-Pint]]" owing to his 5-foot, 5-inch height and had twice broken his leg previously. Parker lived in the [[Westwood, Peterborough|Westwood]] area of the city and worked [[part-time]] as bar support at The Solstice, a local [[public house]] where he had met his girlfriend, Nicola Toms.&lt;ref name=PeterboroughET4&gt;{{cite news|title=Workmates and friends stunned by tragic death|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment_2_17112/workmates_and_friends_stunned_by_tragic_death_1_107870|newspaper=Peterborough Evening Telegraph|location=Peterborough, UK|publisher=Johnston Press|date=22 September 2001|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{Cite news|title=Murder: Family tells of months of torment after death of much-loved son|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment/murder_family_tells_of_months_of_torment_after_death_of_much_loved_son_1_104950|newspaper=Peterborough Evening Telegraph|location=Peterborough, UK|publisher=Johnston Press|date=25 January 2002|accessdate= 27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Twelve held over teenager's death|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1557154.stm|work=BBC News|location=London, UK|publisher=BBC|date=23 September 2001|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PeterboroughET6/&gt;

Toms ran to a nearby [[petrol station]] for help and a man there gave her his mobile phone to call the police. While making the call, she twice heard Parker cry out in pain.

Nigel Rumfitt QC, defending Awan, summarised the crime by stating: "These people were not taking the night air. Every member of the group knew what was going on. These weapons had been selected before they set off. The knife was far too big to be hidden from the others. There is no doubt there was a hunting party looking for a victim."&lt;ref name=PeterboroughET9/&gt;

On 19 December 2002, Nazir, Awan and Ali were all found guilty of murder in [[Unanimous#Juries|unanimous verdicts]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=peterboroughtoday2/&gt; The judge, [[Edwin Jowitt|Sir Edwin Jowitt]], summarised the murder during sentencing:

{{Quote|You put your heads together with the purpose of arming yourselves and of attacking an innocent man you might find by chance simply because he was of a different race to yourselves. A racist killing must be one of the gravest kinds of killing.}}

The judge concluded that Awan had wielded the knife, was the ringleader of the group and had intended to kill.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The three received [[life sentences]], with Awan to serve a minimum of 18 years and the others at least 16.

The BBC Editorial Standards Committee in 2007 found that "there was no evidence to suggest that the BBC had shown a specific and systemic bias in favour of cases where the victim had been black or Asian", but accepted it had "underplayed its coverage of the Ross Parker case" and repeated the failings in its coverage of the [[Murder of Kriss Donald]].&lt;ref name=BBCcomplaint&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/30oct07.pdf|title=Editorial Standards Findings: Appeals to the Trust and other editorial standards matters considered by the Editorial Standards Committee|publisher=The BBC Trust|date=30 October 2007|accessdate=2 May 2014|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKenzie criticised newspapers including his own employer, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. He stated, "if you believe you're a victim of an [[ethnic minority]] and you're white there is nowhere to go. Editors are so liberal that they are scared to be seen that they're moving to the [[Right-wing politics|right]] of their paper". Parker's mother, Davinia, expressed similar concerns that white victims of race crime are ignored. She said "because we are white, English, we didn't get the coverage", adding ""it's as if we don't count".&lt;ref name="Newsnight"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Newsnight|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/6130110.stm|series=Newsnight|serieslink=Newsnight|credits=Presenters:[[Gavin Esler]], [[Martha Kearney]] , Discussion Panel: [[Mark Easton]], [[Kelvin MacKenzie]], [[Lee Jasper]] Interviewee: Davinia Parker|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|location=London, UK|airdate=8 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Easton|first=Mark|title=Redefining racist crime|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6130000/newsid_6130300/6130328.stm?bw=bb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1|work=BBC News|location=London, UK|publisher= BBC|date=8 November 2006|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' investigation by Brendan Montague examined British newspaper archives for coverage of racist crimes, finding "an almost total [[boycott]] of stories involving the white victims of attacks" whereas "cases involving black and minority ethnic victims are widely reported".&lt;ref name="Sunday Times"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Montague|first=Brendan|title=The hidden white victims of racism|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article633759.ece|newspaper=The Sunday Times|location=London, UK|publisher=News UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629121149/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article633759.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12&amp;page=2|archivedate=29 June 2011|date=12 November 2006|accessdate=29 July 2011|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have noted that the lack of coverage is not simply a media issue. [[Peter Fahy]], the spokesman on race issues for the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] said: "A lot of police officers and other professionals feel almost the best thing to do is to try and avoid [discussing such attacks] for fear of being criticised. This is not healthy". Montague suggests the lack of police appeals in cases involving white victims may be a cause of the lack of media coverage.&lt;ref name="Sunday Times"/&gt; Evidence of this was seen in the Parker case, with the police initially appearing keen to dismiss the possible racist aspect of the murder, stating "there was no reason to believe that the attack was racially motivated".&lt;ref name="bbc5"&gt;

American [[Townhall]] commentator Larry Provost focused on the religion of the attackers as the key factor in the murder. Writing in August 2014, he suggested the perpetrators were [[Islamists]] who had been "motivated by religion".&lt;ref name="TownHall"&gt;{{cite news|author=Larry Provost|title=Islamic Terror in the UK|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/larryprovost/2014/08/15/islamic-terror-in-the-uk-n1878301/page/full|work=TownHall.com|location=Nashville|publisher=Salem Web Network|date=15 August 2014|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper which covered Parker's murder more extensively faced criticism. The [[Government Office for the East of England]] produced a report by Dr Roger Green examining race relations in Peterborough. The document suggested that the ''[[Peterborough Evening Telegraph]]'' had a history of insensitivity, and coverage of the case was "possibly adding to any climate of racial and communal unrest". The criticism of the paper was rejected by a senior police officer and an Asian community leader, both of whom praised its handling of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Race: Report critical of '50s attitude' to race issues|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment/race_report_critical_of_50s_attitude_to_race_issues_1_105934|newspaper=Peterborough Evening Telegraph|location=Peterborough|publisher=Johnston Press|date=5 April 2002|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of [[Peterborough City Council]] called the report by Dr Green
unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism: City leaders' anger at 'biased' report|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/local/racism-city-leaders-anger-at-biased-report-1-105940|newspaper=Peterborough Evening Telegraph|location=Peterborough|publisher=Johnston Press|date=4 April 2002|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker's death also had a major impact on his family. His mother, Davinia, was unable to work for three months after Parker's funeral and came close to attempting suicide on a number of occasions. Parker's room was left largely untouched for three years after the incident because his parents were reluctant to tidy it. They described the room as a place they "feel close to Ross".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5/&gt;&lt;ref name=PeterboroughET3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PeterboroughET1/&gt;

[[Mark Easton]] cited the Parker case as demonstrating how society has been forced to redefine racism and discard the erroneous definition of "prejudice plus power"—a definition which, in Easton's view, tended to only allow [[ethnic minorities]] to be victims and whites to be perpetrators. He also considered that "Describing an incident as racist may say as much about a victim's mindset as the offender. How else can one explain the British Crime Survey finding that 3,100 car thefts from Asians were deemed to be racially motivated?"&lt;ref name="BBC News 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Easton|first=Mark|title=Racism and race crime redefined|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6128466.stm|work=BBC News|location=London, UK|publisher=BBC|date=8 November 2006|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yasmin Alibhai-Brown condemned the [[double standards]] of [[racial equality]] campaigners in relation to the case, suggesting [[Black British|black]] activists should "march and remember victims like Ross Parker ... our values are worthless unless all victims of these senseless deaths matter equally".

His "number 14" Netherton United [[Kit (association football)|football shirt]] was draped over his coffin and his teammates formed a [[guard of honour]] dressed in the same strip (kit). [[The Reverend]] Geoffrey Keating described Parker as "a beacon of light who inspired so many people" and "an extremely popular young man".&lt;ref name=PeterboroughET2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murdered — Tributes to Ross on eve of funeral|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment_2_17112/murdered_tributes_to_ross_on_eve_of_funeral_1_104976|newspaper=Peterborough Evening Telegraph|location=Peterborough, UK|publisher=Johnston Press|date=22 October 2001|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The murder received little attention from politicians, although in 2003 [[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[Helen Clark (British politician)|Helen Clark]] made a statement in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] sending condolences to Parker's family, paying tribute to the Peterborough community and in particular Parker's former school. She described Parker's killers only as "men older than him" and her tributes were echoed by [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|house=House of Commons|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030123/halltext/30123h01.htm|date=23 January 2003|column=160WH|accessdate=3 January 2012|title=Parliament UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Nowa Omoigui attended Corona primary school, St Saviors Primary School, and St Mary's Primary School, all in [[Lagos]], Nigeria.&lt;ref name="Google Groups" /&gt; For his secondary education, Nowa Omoigui  [[Federal Government College, Warri]], and [[King's College, Lagos]].&lt;ref name="Google Groups" /&gt; For his undergraduate education, he studied at the [[University of Ibadan]] where he graduated with an [[MBBS]] with distinction.&lt;ref name=Waado&gt;{{cite web|title=About the author Nowa Omoigui|url=http://www.waado.org/nigerian_scholars/archive/debates/forpolicy/sierleone1.html|publisher=Waado|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interest in History==
An autobiographical statement from the Uhrobo Historical Society for Nowa Omoigui reads:&lt;ref name=Waado /&gt;
:::"My amateur interest in History, Political Science and Strategic studies dates back to the sixties. My father was a federal civil servant. As a three-year-old, I lived in the same neighborhood (MacDonald Avenue) as Chief Anthony Enahoro and the late Senator Dalton Asemota (my mother's uncle) in Ikoyi, Lagos. Events relating to the Treasonable Felony Trial [of Obafemi Awolowo and Anthony Enahoro, among others], creation of the Midwest Region and the funeral of Senator Asemota were closely followed by my parents and many discussions were held in my presence, major elements of which, strangely, I still recall! As a seven year old, my family and I were awakened in the early hours of January 15, 1966, by our neighbor on Milverton Road (a British police officer) to tell us about the first coup. During the civil war I was the victim of a number of Biafran air-raids (which I never forgot)."

Nowa Omoigui gained unique and first hand insights (via relationships built with Nigerian military personnel) into many key events associated with Nigeria's military via a [[National Youth Service Corps]] posting with the Nigerian Army's Brigade of Guards in 1983.&lt;ref name=Ojo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ojo|first1=Bamidele|title=Problems and Prospects of Sustaining Democracy in Nigeria|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=9781560729495|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowa Omoigui is a member of the [[South Carolina Military History Club]] and is an amateur gun and military aircraft enthusiast.&lt;ref name=Waado /&gt;

==Writings, Analysis, and Insights==
Nowa Omoigui has written extensively about key events about Nigeria's history: the [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état]], the [[Nigerian Counter-Coup of 1966]], the Nigerian Palace Coup of 1975, the abortive February 13, 1976 coup, the [[Nigerian Military Coup of December 31, 1983]], the palace coup of 1985, the Vatsa Coup Conspiracy of 1985, The Gideon Orkar Coup of 1990 among many others.

'''Offenburg''' ("open borough" - coat of arms showing open gates; [[French language|Fr.]] ''Offenbourg'') is a city located in the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. With about 57,000 inhabitants (2013), it is the largest city and the administrative capital of the [[Ortenaukreis]].

== Geography ==
Offenburg is located approximately 15&amp;nbsp;km east of the river [[Rhine]] between [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Freiburg]]. The French city of [[Strasbourg]] lies 20&amp;nbsp;km  northwest across the Rhine. Offenburg is situated at the mouth of the [[Kinzig (Baden-Württemberg)|Kinzig]] river valley and at the foot of the [[Black Forest]]. The Kinzig flows out of the Black Forest and meets the Rhine near [[Kehl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Offenburg - mitten in Baden |url=https://www.offenburg.de/html/offenburg_mitten_in_baden.html?&amp; |website=Stadt Offenburg (in German) |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times the remainders of Roman settlements have been found within the city's territory. Offenburg was first mentioned in historical documents dating from 1148. By 1240 Offenburg had already been declared a [[Free Imperial City]]. In September 1689 the city - with the exception of two buildings - was totally destroyed during the [[Nine Years War]] by French troops. Due to [[Napoleon]]'s  dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1803 and reorganization of the German states, in 1803 Offenburg lost its status as a Free Imperial City and fell under the rule of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].

During the outbreak of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states#Baden|Revolutions of 1848]], the "''Offenburger Programm''" which contained thirteen demands "in the name of the people of Baden" was announced at the Salmen Inn on 12 September 1847. This was the first democratic demand in Germany. Along with the Karlsbad Resolves, the Offenburger Program demanded basic and human rights as well as freedom of the press and a progressive income tax structure. On 19 March 1848 the demands were confirmed by the 20,000 member Offenburg Peoples' Assembly.

During [[World War I]] Offenburg was one of the first cities to experience the effects from aerial bombardment, the operations against the Offenburg railway sidings mostly being flown by aircraft from the [[Independent Air Force|Independent Force]] out of [[Ochey]] aerodrome.

It is a mostly forgotten fact that in the aftermath of World War I, during the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]], French troops had occupied Offenburg as it fell within the perimeter of the [[Kehl]] bridgehead. The French occupation forces entered the town in February 1923 and stayed until 1924, blocking any traffic on the [[Mannheim–Karlsruhe–Basle railway|Rhine Valley Railway]] between Offenburg and [[Appenweier]].

Following the rise to power of the NSDAP in the 1930s the Jewish population fell victim to acts of repression that in the pre-war era culminated in the vandalization of the local synagoge in November 1938. After the war had begun, those members of the Jewish population that had not managed to emigrate were deported in October 1940 to the concentration camp of [[Gurs]] and in 1942 from there to [[Auschwitz]].

In [[World War II]], owing to the geographical proximity to the French border, Offenburg was either exposed to temporary evacuations during the [[Battle of France]] in 1940 or artillery fire towards the final stages of World War II. Though only being a primary target on one occasion during World War II on 27 November 1944 when a force of more than 300 [[USAAF]] [[B-17]] and [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberator]] bombers attacked the marshalling yards, many tactical attacks were flown during 1944 and 1945 against the railway installations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nath: Luftkriegsoperationen gegen die Stadt Offenburg im Ersten und Zweiten Weltkrieg, in: Die Ortenau (1990), S. 574-659.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Forces entered Offenburg on 15 April 1945 and hence Offenburg became part of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|French Zone of Occupation]] until the creation of [[West Germany|the Federal Republic of Germany]] in May 1949.

Since then Offenburg has been constantly developing, both in size, inhabitants and prosperity. Between 1971 and 1975 eleven adjacent villages were incorporated into the commune of Offenburg and are now an integral part of the city.

== Economy and Infrastructure ==

=== Traffic ===
Owing to its favourable geographic situation Offenburg has been lying at the crossroads of important lines of communication that can be traced back to Roman times.

==== Road ====
Offenburg is situated 3&amp;nbsp;km east of the [[Bundesautobahn 5|federal motorway A 5]], to which it has been connected since 1960 via a famous egg-shaped junction.
Two major federal roads, [[Bundesstraße 3|B 3]] and B 33, intersect at Offenburg.

==== Rail ====
Since the arrival of the railways from Mannheim in 1844, Offenburg had developed into a railway center during the 19th and earlier part of the 20th century. However, since the privatization of the [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] and the ensuing restructuring of the [[Deutsche Bahn AG]] which subsequently led to the shut down of the railway workshops the operations in Offenburg have considerably shrunk in size. 
Today [[Offenburg station]] lies at the crossroads of a number of railway lines, the most important of which is the [[Mannheim–Karlsruhe–Basle railway|Rhine Valley Railway]] the main line between [[Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof|Karlsruhe]] and [[Basel Badischer Bahnhof|Basel]] with regular Intercity Express (ICE) services to Basel, Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, [[Frankfurt Airport]] and Amsterdam. The picturesque [[Black Forest Railway (Baden)|Black Forest Railway]] starts at Offenburg as does the line to [[Appenweier–Strasbourg railway|Strasbourg]] and the line serving the [[Rench Valley Railway|Rench]] valley in the Black Forest.

==== Air ====
Offenburg airfield (EDTO) has been used for flying purposes since 1911 and has received a paved runway in 1975. It is owned by the municipality. However, since its decommissioning and declassification in the 1990s, the 910 metre asphalt runway (02-20) is only available to resident aeroclubs and to aircraft that have obtained prior permission from the operator. Airports in the vicinity are: [[Flughafen Lahr]] in Lahr (EDTL) and, with scheduled traffic, Strasbourg-Entzheim ([[LFST]]) and [[Baden Airpark|Baden-Söllingen]] ([[EDSB]]). Both, Lahr and Baden-Söllingen had formerly been used by the [[Canadian Forces Europe|Canadian Forces in Europe]] and became available for civil use after the end of the [[Cold War]].
The combination of an abundance of three well-equipped airports close by, the ever-growing noise sensitivity of residents as well as the necessity for commercial development areas has in 2012 revived discussions to shut down the aerodrome completely.

=== Trade and Commerce ===
Offenburg has a rich trade and manufacturing sector and is home to a number of well-known brands, e.g. [[Beiersdorf|tesa]], Vivil, [[Meiko Maschinenbau]] (professional dishwashers), [[Hansgrohe]]. The most important single company however, is [[Hubert Burda Media]], one of Germany's most influential publishing companies. 
The expansion of Burda's printing business after World War II has been the most significant factor to the development of the local economy after 1945.

== Education ==
Apart from the primary and secondary schools that are within the responsibility of several public bodies, Offenburg houses a diverse number of educational institutions.

Offenburg is also home to the [[University of Applied Sciences Offenburg]].

== Cultural Heritage  ==
There are several historical attractions in Offenburg including:

* The Salmen Inn
* The [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] Monastery
* The ''Ritterhaus'', a 1784 manor-house that has been converted into the city archives and museum
* The Jewish Bath (''[[Mikveh]]''): a bathhouse belonging to the city's historical Jewish community; it was held to be medieval, but recent research suggests it may be from the 16th or 17th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Offenburger Judenbad jünger als angenommen (Offenburg Jewish Bath younger than expected)|publisher=Amtsblatt der Stadt Offenburg (Official Journal of the town of Offenburg)|url=http://www.stadt-offenburg.de/lib/download.php?key=583e5657039e&amp;file=/dynamic/presse/offenblatt/c0f7fe26ed198ad3.pdf&amp;name=Offenblatt%2024.01.2004 |accessdate=7 May 2012|language=German|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Giant Lance''' was a secret [[military operation]] by the [[United States]] that simulated a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] on the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name=suri&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/16-03/ff_nuclearwar |author=Jeremi Suri |title=The Nukes of October: Richard Nixon's Secret Plan to Bring Peace to Vietnam |publisher=[[Wired Magazine]] |date=2008-02-25| accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, 1969, on the advice of [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]], U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] issued the order.

Preparations were made to send a squadron of 18 [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]s of the [[92d Strategic Aerospace Wing]] loaded with [[nuclear weapon]]s to fly toward the [[Soviet Union]]. It was hoped that this would convince the Soviets that Nixon was willing to resort to nuclear war in order to win the [[Vietnam War]]. The squadron took off on October 27 and flew towards the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/madman-nuclear-alert-secrecy-signaling-and-safety-october-1969|title=The Madman Nuclear Alert: Secrecy, Signaling, and Safety in October 1969 {{!}} Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs|website=www.belfercenter.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actions were designed to be detectable by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="ventura"&gt;{{cite book|title=63 Documents The Government Doesn't Want You To Read|author=[[Jesse Ventura]]|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]], 2011|isbn=978-1-61608-226-0|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon cancelled the operation on October 30.&lt;ref name=suri/&gt;

'''Pyramidology''' (or '''pyramidism''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ANB|title=William Dudley Pelley}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to various [[religion|religious]] or [[pseudocience|pseudoscientific]] speculations regarding [[pyramid]]s, most often the [[Giza pyramid complex]] and the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="KaufmanKaufman2018"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Allison B.

P. Putnam's Sons, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; Some "pyramidologists" also concern themselves with the monumental structures of [[pre-Columbian]] [[the Americas|America]] (such as [[Teotihuacan]], the [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Maya civilization]], and the [[Inca]] of the [[South America]]n [[Andes]]), and the temples of [[Southeast Asia]].

Some pyramidologists claim that the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] has encoded within it predictions for the [[The Exodus|exodus]] of [[Moses]] from Egypt,&lt;ref name="Capt, E. Raymond 1978 pp. 76-78"&gt;Capt, E.

Pyramidology reached its peak by the early 1980s.  Interest revived when in 1992 and 1993 Rudolf Gantenbrink sent a miniature remote-controlled [[robot]] rover, known as [[The Upuaut Project|upuaut]], up one of the "air shafts" in the Queen's Chamber of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].  Upuaut discovered the shaft closed off by a stone block with decaying copper hooks attached to the outside.  In 1994 [[Robert Bauval]] published the book ''The Orion Mystery'', attempting to prove that the pyramids on the Giza plateau were built to mimic the stars in the belt of the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], a claim that came to be known as the [[Orion correlation theory]]. 

== Types of pyramidology ==

The main types of pyramidological accounts involve one or more aspects which include:

*[[Metrology|metrological]]: theories regarding the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza by hypothetical geometric measurements
*[[numerology|numerological]]: theories that the measurements of the Great Pyramid and its passages have [[esotericism|esoteric]] significance, and that their [[geometry|geometric]] measurements contain some encoded message. This form of pyramidology is popular within Christian Pyramidology (e.g. [[British Israelism]] and [[Bible Students movement|Bible Students]]).
*"[[pyramid power]]": claims originating in the late 1960s that pyramids as geometrical shapes possess [[supernatural]] powers
*[[Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeological]]: varying theories that deny the pyramids were built to serve exclusively as tombs for the [[Pharaohs]]; alternative explanations regarding the construction of the pyramids (for example the use of long-lost knowledge; [[anti-gravity]] technology, etc...); and hypotheses that they were built by someone other than the historical [[Ancient Egypt]]ians (e.g. early [[Hebrews]], [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], or even [[Extraterrestrial life|extra-terrestrial]]s)

== History ==

===Metrological===

Metrological pyramidology dates to the 17th century. [[John Greaves]], an [[England|English]] [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]] and [[antiquarian]], first took precise measurements of the [[Great Pyramid at Giza]] using the best mathematical instruments of the day. His data was published in ''Pyramidographia'' (1646) which theorized a geometric cubit was used by the builders of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] (see: [[Cubit|Egyptian royal cubit]]). While Greave's measurements were objective, his metrological data was later misused by numerologists:

{{Quote|J. Greaves in his ''Pyramidographia'', 1646, made an objective description of these structures, but using his measurements, some philosophers started to propose a more subjective reading of them: Kircher suggested that they had mystical and hidden meanings; Th. Shaw thought the Great Pyramid was a temple to Osiris; I. Newton created the concept of “sacred code” to denote one of the two supposed instruments used to erect them.&lt;ref&gt;Angel Molinero Polo, M. (2009). "[https://www.academia.edu/1416664/Astronomical_Historiography_in_four_Movements Astronomical historiography in four movements]". In: Search of Cosmic Order: Selected Essays on Egyptian Archaeoastronomy. Supreme Council of Antiquities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===John Taylor===

In his work ''The great pyramid; why was it built: &amp; who built it?'' (1859) [[John Taylor (1781-1864)|John Taylor]] described a possible connection with the dimensions of the pyramid and the [[golden ratio]] (see [[Kepler triangle]]). He also proposed that the 
inch used to build the Great Pyramid (see [[pyramid inch]]) was 1/25 of the "sacred cubit" (whose existence had earlier been postulated by Isaac Newton). Taylor was also the first to claim the pyramid was divinely inspired, contained a revelation and was built not by the Egyptians, but instead the Hebrews pointing to Biblical passages (Is. 19: 19-20; Job 38: 5-7) to support his theories.&lt;ref&gt;''A Study in Pyramidology'', E. Raymond Capt, Hoffman Printing, 1996 ed. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason Taylor is often credited as being the "founder of pyramidology". [[Martin Gardner]] noted:

{{quote|[...] it was not until 1859 that Pyramidology was born.  This was the year that John Taylor, an eccentric partner in a London publishing firm, issued his ''The Great Pyramid: Why was it Built? And Who Built it?'' [...] Taylor never visited the Pyramid, but the more he studied its structure, the more he became convinced that its architect was not an Egyptian, but an Israelite acting under divine orders. Perhaps it was Noah himself.&lt;ref name="gardner"/&gt;}}

===Christian pyramidology===

====British Israelism====
Taylor in turn influenced the Astronomer Royal of Scotland [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]], F.R.S.E., F.R.A.S., who made numerous [[numerological]] calculations on the pyramid and published them in a 664-page book ''Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid'' (1864) followed by ''Life, and Work in the Great Pyramid'' (1867). These two works fused pyramidology with [[British Israelism]] and Smyth first linked the hypothetical [[pyramid inch]] to the British Imperial Unit system.&lt;ref&gt;M. Reisenauer, "The battle of the standards" : Great Pyramid metrology and British identity, 1859-1890, The Historian, v.&amp;nbsp;65 no.&amp;nbsp;4 (Summer 2003) p. 931–978; E.&amp;nbsp;F.&amp;nbsp;Cox, The International Institute: First organized opposition to the metric system, Ohio History, v. 68, 54–83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cpsmyth.jpg|thumb|This diagram from [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]]'s ''Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid'' (1864) shows some of his measurements and chronological determinations made from them]]

Smyth's theories were later expanded upon by early 20th century British Israelites such as Colonel Garnier (''Great Pyramid: Its Builder &amp; Its Prophecy'', 1905), who began to theorise that chambers within the Great Pyramid contain prophetic dates which concern the future of the British, [[Celts|Celtic]], or [[Anglo-Saxon]] peoples. However this idea originated with Robert Menzies, an earlier correspondent of Smyth's.&lt;ref&gt;The idea of associating lengths in the pyramid with dates in history was suggested to Smyth by Robert Menzies, [Smyth, 1864, appendix II].&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Davidson (engineer)|David Davidson]] with H.&amp;nbsp;Aldersmith wrote ''The Great Pyramid, Its Divine Message'' (1924) and further introduced the idea that Britain's chronology (including future events) may be unlocked from inside the Great Pyramid. This theme is also found in Basil Stewart's trilogy on the same subject: ''Witness of the Great Pyramid'' (1927), ''The Great Pyramid, Its Construction, Symbolism and Chronology'' (1931) and ''History and Significance of the Great Pyramid...'' (1935).  More recently a four-volume set entitled ''Pyramidology'' was published by British Israelite Adam Rutherford (released between 1957–1972).&lt;ref&gt;Adam Rutherford, Pyramidology Books 1, 2, and 3, C.&amp;nbsp;Tinling &amp; Co Ltd London, Liverpool and Prescot 1961, 1962 &amp; 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; British Israelite author E.&amp;nbsp;Raymond Capt also wrote ''Great Pyramid Decoded'' in 1971 followed by ''Study in Pyramidology'' in 1986.

====Joseph A. Seiss====
[[Joseph Seiss]] was a Lutheran minister who was a proponent of pyramidology. He wrote ''A Miracle in Stone: or, The Great Pyramid of Egypt'' in 1877. His work was popular with contemporary [[evangelical Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Pyramid of Egypt, Miracle in Stone: Secrets and Advanced Knowledge'' (2007 Reprint) by Joseph Augustus Seiss, Forgottenbooks.com, pages vii-x.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charles Taze Russell====
In 1891 pyramidology reached a global audience when it was integrated into the works of [[Charles Taze Russell]], founder of the [[Bible Student movement]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses'', Edmond C. Gruss, Xulon Press, 2001, pp. 210-212.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell however denounced the British-Israelite variant of pyramidology in an article called ''The Anglo-Israelitish Question'' .&lt;ref&gt;''Thy Kingdom Come'', Charles Taze Russell, C-291, Oakland Co. Bible Students, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting [[Joseph Seiss]]'s designation that the Great Pyramid of Giza was "the Bible in stone" Russell taught that it played a special part in God's plan during the "last days" basing his interpretation on Isaiah 19:19-20 which says - "In that day shall there be an altar (pile of stones) to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar (Hebrew ''matstebah'', or monument) at the border thereof to the Lord. And it shall be for a sign, and for a witness unto the Lord of Hosts in the land of Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thy Kingdom Come|author=Charles Taze Russell|publisher=Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society|year=1890|url=http://www.pastor-russell.com/volumes/V3/Study_10.html|pages=309–376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two brothers, archaeologists John and Morton Edgar, as personal associates and supporters of Russell, wrote extensive treatises on the history, nature, and prophetic symbolism of the Great Pyramid in relation to the then known archaeological history, along with their interpretations of prophetic and Biblical chronology.  They are best known for their two-volume work ''Great Pyramid Passages and Chambers'', published in 1910 and 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John and Morton Edgar|title=Great Pyramid Passages, Vol.&amp;nbsp;2|url=http://www.a2z.org/wtarchive/docs/1913_Great_Pyramid_Passages_Vol_II.pdf|format=PDF|year=1913|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928032004/http://www.a2z.org/wtarchive/docs/1913_Great_Pyramid_Passages_Vol_II.pdf|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}} {{cite book|author=Morton Edgar|title=The Great Pyramid: Its Symbolism, Science and Prophecy|url=http://www.a2z.org/wtarchive/docs/1924_Great_Pyramid_Its_Symbolism_Science_and_Prophecy.pdf|format=PDF|year=1924|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most Bible Student groups continue to support and endorse the study of pyramidology from a Biblical perspective, the Bible Students associated with the [[Watchtower Society]], who chose ’[[Jehovah's Witnesses]]’ as their new name in 1931, have abandoned pyramidology entirely since 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael ''The Skeptic encyclopedia of pseudoscience, Vol.&amp;nbsp;2'' ABC-CLIO Ltd; illustrated edition (31 Oct 2002) {{ISBN|978-1-57607-653-8}} p.406 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;dq=joseph+rutherford+pyramidology+inspired+by+devil+watchtower&amp;num=100&amp;ei=HGWHS8r7NaG4yQSsgpS-Dg&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', November 15 and December 1, 1928. Watchtower, Bible and Tract Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pyramid power===
{{main|Pyramid power}}

Another set of speculations concerning pyramids have centered upon the possible existence of an unknown energy concentrated in pyramidical structures.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology'', Lewis Spence, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, pp. 759-760: "...speculations concerning pyramids have centered upon the possible existence of an unknown energy concentrated in pyramidical structures. Pyramid energy was rediscovered in the early 1970s after it was introduced in the popular best-selling ''Psychic Discoveries behind the Iron Curtain'' by journalists Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder. They described their experience with a Czech radio engineer, Karl Drbal, who had taken out a patent on a pyramid razor blade sharpener. The idea was picked up by New Age writer Lyll Wat and then a host of others including Peter Toth, Greg Nielsen, and Pat Flanagan. Through the 1970s, it was a common theme at psychic and New Age gatherings."&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyramid energy was popularized in the early 1970s, particularly by [[New Age]] authors such as [[Patrick Flanagan]] (''Pyramid Power: The Millennium Science'', 1973), Max Toth and Greg Nielsen (''Pyramid Power'', 1974) and Warren Smith (''Secret Forces of the Pyramids'', 1975). These works focused on the alleged energies of pyramids in general, not solely the Egyptian pyramids. Toth and Nielsen for example reported experiments where "seeds stored in pyramid replicas germinated sooner and grew higher".&lt;ref&gt;''Interventions in applied gerontology'', Robert F. Morgan, Kendall/Hunt Pub. Co., 1981, pp.123-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudoarchaeology===

[[Lewis Spence]] in his ''[[An Encyclopaedia of Occultism]]'' (1920) summed up on the earliest of [[pseudoarcheology|pseudoarcheological]] claims on the ancient Egyptian pyramids as follows:

"...in the 1880s, Ignatius Donnelly had suggested that the Great Pyramid had been built by the descendants of the Atlanteans. That idea was picked up in the 1920s by [[Manly Palmer Hall]] who went on to suggest that they were the focus of the ancient Egyptian wisdom schools. [[Edgar Cayce]] built upon Hall's speculations."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology'', Lewis Spence, Kessinger Publishing, 2003 (reprint), pp.759-761.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ignatius Donnelly]] and later proponents of the [[hyperdiffusionist]] view of history claimed that all pyramid structures across the world had a common origin. Donelly claimed this common origin was in [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Atlantis, the Antediluvian World'', Ignatius Donnelly, 1882, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] claimed Egypt, writing: "Small groups of people, moving mainly by sea, settled at certain places and there made rude imitations of the Egyptian monuments of the Pyramid Age."&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Egyptians and the origin of Civilization (London/New York, Harper &amp; Brother 1911), p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient astronauts====
{{main|Ancient astronauts}}

Several proponents of ancient astronauts claim that the Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed by extraterrestrial beings, or influenced by them (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;through their advanced technology).&lt;ref&gt;''They Built the Pyramids'', Joseph Davidovits, Geopolymer Institute, 2008, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents include [[Erich von Däniken]], [[Robert Charroux]], [[W.&amp;nbsp;Raymond Drake]], and [[Zecharia Sitchin]]. According to Erich Von Däniken, the Great Pyramid has advanced numerological properties which could not have been known to the ancient Egyptians and so must have been passed down by extraterrestrials: "...the height of the pyramid of Cheops, multiplied by a thousand million—98,000,000 miles—corresponds approximately to the distance between the Earth and the sun".&lt;ref&gt;''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', Prometheus Books, 2003, Terence Hines, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orion correlation theory====
{{main|Orion correlation theory}}

[[File:orion - pyramids.jpg|thumb|Representation of the central tenet of the [[Orion correlation theory|OCT]] - the outline of the Giza pyramids superimposed over a photograph of the stars in Orion's Belt. To achieve this concordance the pyramids have been rotated and scaled to suit.]]

[[Robert Bauval]] and [[Graham Hancock]] (1996) have both suggested that the 'ground plan' of the three main Egyptian pyramids was physically established in c. 10,500 BC, but that the pyramids were built around 2,500 BC. This theory was based on their 
initial claims regarding the alignment of the Giza pyramids with Orion ("…the three pyramids were a terrestrial map of the three stars of Orion's belt"&amp;mdash; Hancock's ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'', 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;375) are later joined with speculation about the age of the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]] (Hancock and Bauval, ''[[Keeper of Genesis]]'', published 1996, and in 1997 in the U.S. as ''The Message of the Sphinx'').

=====Advanced technology=====

Linked to the pseudoarchaeological ancient astronaut theory and [[Orion correlation theory]] are related claims that the Great Pyramid was constructed by the use of an advanced lost technology. Proponents of this theory often link this hypothetical advanced technology to extraterrestrials but also [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]ns or a legendary lost race.&lt;ref&gt;''Technology of the Gods: The Incredible Sciences of the Ancients'', David Hatcher Childress, Adventures Unlimited Press (1 Jun 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Forbidden Science: From Ancient Technologies to Free Energy'', J. Douglas Kenyon, Inner Traditions International (21 Mar 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Giza Power Plant: Technologies of Ancient Egypt'', Christopher Dunn, Bear &amp; Company (31 Oct 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Notable proponents include Christopher Dunn and [[David Hatcher Childress]]. Graham Hancock also in his book ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'' assigned the 'ground plan' of the three main Egyptian pyramids, in his theory to an advanced progenitor civilization which possessed advanced technology.

===Alan F. Alford===

Author [[Alan F. Alford]] interprets the entire Great Pyramid in the context of ancient Egyptian religion. Alford takes as his starting point the golden rule that the [[pharaoh]] had to be buried in the earth, i.e. at ground level or below, and this leads him to conclude that [[Khufu]] was interred in an ingeniously concealed cave whose entrance is today sealed up in the so-called Well Shaft adjacent to a known cave called the Grotto.&lt;ref&gt;Alford, ''Pyramid of Secrets'', chapter 4; ''The Midnight Sun'', pp. 352-56, 358-70.&lt;/ref&gt; He has lobbied the Egyptian authorities to explore this area of the pyramid with ground penetrating radar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eridu.co.uk/Author/News_and_Views/news_and_views.html Alford, ''News and Views''&lt;!--Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cult of creation theory also provided the basis for Alford's next idea: that the sarcophagus in the King's Chamber - commonly supposed to be Khufu's final resting place - actually enshrined [[iron meteorite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Alford, ''Pyramid of Secrets'', chapter 5; ''The Midnight Sun'', pp. 356-58&lt;/ref&gt; He maintains, by reference to the [[Pyramid Texts]], that this iron was blasted into the sky at the time of creation, according to the Egyptians' [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] way of thinking. Alford says the King's Chamber, with its upward inclined dual 'airshafts', was built to capture the magic of this mythical moment.&lt;ref&gt;Alford, ''Pyramid of Secrets'', pp. 201-4; The Midnight Sun, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alford's most speculative idea is that the King's Chamber generated low frequency sound via its 'airshafts', the purpose being to re-enact the sound of the earth splitting open at the time of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Alford, ''Pyramid of Secrets'', chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Mail'', 21 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century, India===
Various spiritual organizations in India, have used pyramids as a means to promote theories of their potency.
Numerous papers have been published in an Indian science journal called the ''Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge'' by the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]].&lt;ref name="csir website"&gt;[http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/43/simple-search?query=pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The renowned Egyptologist [[Flinders Petrie]] in 1880 went to Egypt to perform new measurements of the Great Pyramid and wrote that he found that the pyramid was several feet smaller than previously believed by [[John Taylor (1781-1864)|John Taylor]] and [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]].&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Flinders Petrie, ''The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh'' (London, 1883), p. 189 [http://www.ronaldbirdsall.com/gizeh/petrie/index.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; Flinders therefore claimed that the hypothetical [[pyramid inch]] of the pyramidologists had no basis in truth and published his results in "The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh" (1883), writing: "there is no authentic example, that will bear examination, of the use or existence of any such measure as a 'Pyramid inch,' or of a cubit of 25.025 British inches." Proponents of the pyramid inch, especially British Israelites responded to Petrie's discoveries and claimed to have found flaws in them.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Pyramid Its Divine Message'', D. Davidson, H. Aldersmith, Kessinger Publishing, 1992, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrie refused to respond to these criticisms, claiming he had disproved the pyramid inch and compared continuing proponents to "[[flat earth]] believers":

{{blockquote|[...] It is useless to state the real truth of the matter, as it has no effect on those who are subject to this type of hallucination.  They can but be left with the flat earth believers and other such people to whom a theory is dearer than a fact.&lt;ref&gt;''Seventy Years in Archaeology'', London: Sampsom Low, Marston &amp; Co. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1930, Belgian Egyptologists [[Jean Capart]] and [[Marcelle Werbrouck]] stated that "with the help of mathematicians – and often mingling with them – mystics have invented what might be called the “religion of the pyramids”".&lt;ref&gt;Capart, Jean &amp; Werbrouck, Marcelle (1930). ''Memphis à l'ombre des pyramides''. Bruxelles, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later, [[Adolf Erman]] complained the fact that certain theories were still proposed even though a century of research would have debunked all of these long since.&lt;ref&gt;Erman, Adolf (1936). ''Die Welt am Nil, Bilder aus dem alten Ägypten''. Leipzig, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 1937 [[Gustave Jéquier]] chose to expose his criticism of the pyramidology assumptions on a mass media, the newspaper ''[[Gazette de Lausanne]]'', lamenting that "these speculations didn't deserve the resonance they have had" and warning the audience against "prophecies incurred by arguments masked as science, when the very foundations of these reasonings, cleverly disguised, are nothing but inaccurate news or simple hypotheses and that the whole argument is clearly tendentious".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{cite book |last=Cimmino |first= Franco |authorlink=  |date=1996 |title= Storia delle Piramidi |url= |location= Milano |publisher= Rusconi |page= |isbn= 88-18-70143-6 }}, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''pyramidiot'' is said to have been coined by Leonard Cottrell, whose 1956 book ''The Mountains of Pharaoh'' included a chapter entitled "The Great Pyramidiot" about Piazzi Smyth's theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years | author = Peter S. Rodman | page = 175 | year = 2007 | publisher = Prometheus Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 Barbara Mertz, reflecting the views of the scientific establishment, reported another term for pyramidologists:

{{blockquote|Even in modern times when people, one would think, should know better, the Great Pyramid of Giza has proved a fertile field for fantasy. The people who do not know better are the Pyramid mystics, who believe that the Great Pyramid is a gigantic prophecy in stone, built by a group of ancient adepts in magic. Egyptologists sometimes uncharitably refer to this group as 'Pyramidiots,' but the school continues to flourish despite scholarly anathemas.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Mertz, ''Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs: A popular history of ancient Egypt'', New York: Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., 1964&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Toronto Society for Psychical Research organized a research team consisting of Allan Alter (B.Sc.Phm) and Dale Simmons (Dip. Engr. Tech) to explore claims made in Pyramid Power literature that pyramids could preserve better organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Alter, "The Pyramid and Food Dehydration," New Horizons, Vol. 1 (Summer 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive tests showed that pyramid containers "are no more effective than those of other shapes in preserving and dehydrating organic material."&lt;ref&gt;The incredible [[Dr. Matrix]], Martin Gardner, Scribner, 1976, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pseudoscience and the paranormal'', Terence Hines, Prometheus Books, 2003, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

French Egyptologist and architect [[Jean-Philippe Lauer]] undertook a scientific analysis of several pyramidologists' claims by reconstructing their reasoning step by step and redoing their mathematical calculations. In 1974, he concluded that those intuitions, though fascinating and made by people in good faith, have little to no regard to archaeology needs, if not to any other science at all.&lt;ref&gt;Lauer, Jean-Philippe (1974). ''Le Mystère des Pyramides''. Paris, Presses de la Cité, {{ISBN|2-258-02368-8}}, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cimmino, op. cit., p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9493">The '''Rule of Law in Armed Conflicts Project''' ('''RULAC Project''') is an initiative of the [[Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights]] to support the application and implementation of the [[Public international law|international]] [[Laws of war|law of armed conflict]].

==Overview==
Through a global [[database]] and analysis, the RULAC Project has as its aim an assessment of the implementation by [[Sovereign state|states]] of the law applicable in armed conflicts: 
*[[international humanitarian law]] 
*[[international human rights law]]
*[[international criminal law]]
*[[refugee law]]

The project will ultimately cover all [[List of United Nations member states|member states of the United Nations]] and parties to the [[Geneva Conventions]] as well as contested territories, whether they are in situation of armed conflict or not. Indeed, certain international rules must be implemented during peacetime or are relevant in post-conflict situations, in particular those relating to the repression of international crimes. In addition, the rules regarding the fight against [[terrorism]], also to be covered by the website, are applicable to states that are not necessarily in a situation of armed conflict.

The website is divided into three parts. The homepage offers a small description of the applicable law and addresses the main legal issues in that area, for example the legal qualification of conflicts or the applicability of international law to non-state armed groups. The website then offers for each country the relevant texts and documents dealing with the national and international legal framework (national [[legislation]] and [[case law]], [[Resolution (law)|resolutions]] of [[intergovernmental organizations]], [[treaty]], etc.). Finally, the website offers a legal analysis that, on one hand, qualifies the conflict under international humanitarian law and on the other hand, determines the applicable law. This part of the website, certainly the most delicate in juridical and political terms, is particular to the RULAC Project.

The RULAC Project should prove to be a precious source of information for government officials, journalists and more widely for any person interested by the respect of the law in war.

==Geneva Conventions==
The first three Geneva Conventions were revised, expanded, and replaced, and the fourth one was added, in 1949.

* The Geneva Convention ''for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field'' was adopted in 1864. It was significantly revised and replaced by the 1906 version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/INTRO/180?OpenDocument |title=Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field. Geneva, 6 July 1906 |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field (1929)|1929 version]], and later the [[First Geneva Convention]] of 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cil.nus.edu.sg/1949/1949-geneva-convention-i-for-the-amelioration-of-the-condition-of-the-wounded-and-sick-in-armed-forces-in-the-field/ 1949 Geneva Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221161712/http://cil.nus.edu.sg/1949/1949-geneva-convention-i-for-the-amelioration-of-the-condition-of-the-wounded-and-sick-in-armed-forces-in-the-field/ |date=2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Geneva Convention ''for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea'' was adopted in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The International Committee of the Red Cross: A Neutral Humanitarian Actor |date=June 17, 2007 |author=David P. Forsythe |page=43 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-4153-4151-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was significantly revised and replaced by the [[Second Geneva Convention]] of 1949.
* The [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention ''relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War'' was adopted in 1929]]. It was significantly revised and replaced by the [[Third Geneva Convention]] of 1949.
* The [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] ''relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'' was adopted in 1949.

In addition, there are three additional amendment protocols to the Geneva Convention:
* [[Protocol I]] (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts. As of 12 January 2007 it had been ratified by 167 countries.
* [[Protocol II]] (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts. As of 12 January 2007 it had been ratified by 163 countries.
* [[Protocol III]] (2005): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem. As of June 2007 it had been ratified by 17 countries and signed but not yet ratified by an additional 68 countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6435">'''Second modernity''' is a phrase coined by the [[Germany|German]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Ulrich Beck]], and is his word for the period after [[modernity]].

Where modernity broke down [[Agrarian society|agricultural society]] in favour of [[industrial society]], second modernity transforms industrial society into a new and more reflexive [[network society]] or information society {{harv|He|2012|loc=111 and 215}}.

==Risk society==
{{Main|Risk society}}
Second modernity is marked by a new awareness of the risks — risks to all forms of life, plant, animal and human — created by the very successes of modernity in tackling the problem of human scarcity {{harv|Carrier and Nordmann|2011|loc=449}}. Systems that previously seemed to offer protection from risks both natural and social are increasingly recognised as producing new man-made risks on a global scale as a byproduct of their functioning {{harv|He|2012|loc=147}}. Such systems become part of the problem, not the solution. Modernisation and information advances themselves create new social dangers, such as [[cybercrime]] (He 2012, 69), while scientific advances open up new areas, like [[cloning]] or [[genetic modification]], where decisions are necessarily made without adequate capacity to assess longterm consequences {{harv|Allan, Adam, and Carter|1999|loc=xii–ii}}.

Recognising the fresh dilemmas created by this [[reflexive modernization]], Beck has suggested a new "cosmopolitan Realpolitik" to overcome the difficulties of a world in which national interests can no longer be promoted effectively at the national level alone {{harv|Beck|2006|loc=173}}.

==Knowledge society==
Second modernity has also been linked to the so-called [[Society#Knowledge|knowledge society]], marked by a pluralisation of different types of knowledge {{harv|Carrier|n.d.|loc=439 and 448}}. It is characterised in particular by knowledge-dependent risks — the uncertainties manufactured by the information world itself {{harv|Harding|2008|loc=55–58}}.

==Resistance==

Various forms of resistance to second modernity have emerged, among them for example [[Euroscepticism]] {{harv|Marchetti and Vidović|2010|loc=171}}.

Beck himself sees [[al-Qaeda]] as a by-product of, as well as resistance to, second modernity, not only in its use of information technology tools, but also in its syncretist ideology {{harv|Beck|2006|loc=113}}.

[[File:AlexanderI.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Balas]]]]
The '''coinage of the Seleucid Empire''' is based on the [[coin]]s of [[Alexander the Great]], which in turn were based on [[Athenian coinage]] of the [[Attic weight]]. Many mints and different issues are defined, with mainly base and [[silver]] coinage being in abundance. A large concentration of mints existed in the [[Seleucid]] Syria, as the Mediterranean parts of the empire were more reliant on coinage in economic function.

The symbol of Seleucid power was the anchor, which was placed on the obverse of coins depicting Alexander posthumously. Some Seleucid bronze coinage feature decorative serrated edges similarly with certain Roman [[denarii]] and rare Macedonian coins.

The first Seleucid royal mint was at [[Seleucia on the Tigris]]. [[Antioch]], as a new capital, did have the most important mint after Seleucus I moved mint workers there from Seleucia.

==Denominations==
''Bronze'' coinage was issued in five denominations; the weight and size varies greatly and most likely no effort was made to conform to a set standard, they may be denominated in [[chalkoi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seleukids.org/seleukids.htm |title=A history of the Seleukid Empire and its kings|accessdate=June 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617173312/http://seleukids.org/seleukids.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A size''' = 23+&amp;nbsp;mm   = 10+&amp;nbsp;g
*'''B size''' = 18–23&amp;nbsp;mm = 6.77–8.63&amp;nbsp;g
*'''C size''' = 13–17&amp;nbsp;mm = 3.88&amp;nbsp;g
*'''D size''' = 12–13&amp;nbsp;mm = 1.59&amp;nbsp;g
*'''E size''' = 10–12&amp;nbsp;mm = 1.13&amp;nbsp;g
The denomination values and common imagery on ''silver'' coinage was as follows, with the denomination based on the [[Obol (coin)|Obol]] and image most common on the coin:&lt;ref&gt;[Babelon, Rois, Pl. II. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|Ancient Greek coinage}}

Successor states of the [[Macedonian Empire]] continued to mint coins with image of [[Alexander the Great]]. Such coins were widespread within the Seleucid Empire, as all mints except the one in [[Bactra]] struck them.&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Howgego|title=Ancient History from Coins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07GKPP5RLQwC&amp;pg=PT38|date=11 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-87783-6|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antiochus I]], son of Seleucus I, was the first Seleucid ruler to strike coins with his own image on them.&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"/&gt;

Typically, coins which were not based on [[Attic weight]], did not circulate within the empire. [[Attalid]], Ptolemaic and [[Rhodian]] coins were using a different standard. Regulations may have existed to enforce usage of the Attic standard. However, the regulations were probably made for practical reasons rather than being politically motivated. [[Coele-Syria]] and [[Phoenicia]] were exceptions to the rule of using the Attic standard. They were conquered by [[Antiochus III the Great]] in 200 BC. Seleucids struck some coins in the Ptolemaic standard to be used in the region, and both standards coexisted there.&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newell"/&gt;

Seleucid regulations on coinage different from [[Achaemenid Persia]] on several aspects. Achaemenid rulers did not try to unify standards for the coinage, and they allowed local [[satrap]]s to strike coins in their own name. While the Seleucids preserved the system of satraps, they banned local rulers from striking coins in their own name. Some cities had their own mints for bronze coinage, while gold coins and large silver denominations were made only at the royal mints. However, the empire controlled on some extent even the striking of local bronze coinage.&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"/&gt;

After Antiochus III was defeated in a [[Roman–Seleucid War|war against Rome]] and a large war indemnity had to be paid, silver coinage became scarcer and lighter. There were few new silver coins struck for two decades after the defeat. Bronze mostly replaced silver in mints between 173 BC and 171 BC.&lt;ref name="Crawford1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Hewson Crawford|title=Coinage and Money Under the Roman Republic: Italy and the Mediterranean Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=84_G_8q6WQcC&amp;pg=PA155|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05506-3|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Seleucid Empire began to decline, and its rule on parts of the empire weakened since the last decades of the second century BC, local cities began producing their own silver coinages to show their autonomy from the central bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"/&gt;

Despite seemingly enforcing some regulations, Seleucid policy was still somewhat free compared to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] which imposed an exclusive royal currency.&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"/&gt; In coin making process there were similarities with the Ptolemaic coinage. For instance, the Seleucid coins often have a central depression from the coin making process.&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonald2012"/&gt;

==Mints==
Seleucid core territory around Syria had a large concentration of mints. Eastern provinces had a single mint each.&lt;ref name="HeckelSullivan2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Waldemar Heckel|author2=Richard Sullivan|title=Ancient Coins of the Graeco-Roman World: The Nickle Numismatic Papers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6NLfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|date=30 October 2010|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-1-55458-699-8|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mediterranean regions of the Seleucid kingdom were more monetized, and were economically more reliant on coinage. Use of coinage in Mesopotamia, including areas such as [[Babylonia]] and [[Susiana]], was most likely mainly an urban phenomenon, while in rural areas Greek coinage was not necessary for daily life. In Mesopotamia taxation and official payments were most likely the parts of economy where coinage saw usage. Despite Mesopotamia sawing increasing use of coinage during the [[Hellenistic period]], the impact may have been a modest one. Traditional methods of payment did not disappear.&lt;ref name="SpekZanden2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=R.J. Van der Spek|author2=Jan Luiten van Zanden|author3=Bas van Leeuwen|title=A History of Market Performance: From Ancient Babylonia to the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0XtsBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT501|date=4 September 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-91849-3|pages=501–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seleucia on the Tigris]] held the first Seleucid mint as a capital. Later, when [[Seleucus I Nicator]] prioritized construction of an important port city of [[Antioch]] over Seleucia, workers from the Seleucia mint were moved to new capital at Antioch. The mint at Antioch produced gold coins, as well as royal bronze coins minted in name of the king. The old mint at Seleucia functioned as a municipal mint at this point, and they did mint the coins in their own name. Furthermore, the mint at Antioch produced more bronze coins than Seleucia. Seleucid dynasty seems to have attempted to create a uniform coinage throughout the empire, as coins with similar symbols and images have been discovered from coinage minted all around the empire. These common symbols include an anchor and a charging bull.&lt;ref name="Cohen1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Getzel M. Cohen|title=The Hellenistic Settlements in Europe, the Islands, and Asia Minor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6p4lDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129|year=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08329-5|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early coinage of the Seleucid Empire was struck in name of [[Alexander the Great]], or the coins at least included his image. [[Bactra]] mint was an exception to this almost universal rule as it did not strike coins with the image of Alexander the Great.&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"/&gt;

Mint in [[Ptolemais in Phoenicia]] was among the most active ones. While other mints generally used Attic weight, the one in Ptolemais struck coins in a different weight, even after it was conquered by [[Antiochus III the Great]].&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newell"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Newell|first=Edward T. |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/77751499/The-first-Seleucid-coinage-of-Tyre-by-Edward-T-Newell|title=The first Seleucid coinage of Tyre|publisher=Digital Library Numis (DLN)|access-date=17 December 2017|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the city struck silver coinage without an interruption after it changed hands, as it was a very important city in [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref name="Newell"/&gt;

==Design and symbols==
[[File:Apipanes atzmon.JPG|thumb|Bronze coin of Antiochus IV]]
Anchor was the symbol of Seleucid dynasty starting from the reign of [[Seleucus I Nicator]] in 305 BC, and it was used by his successors.&lt;ref name="Pfrommer1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Pfrommer|title=Metalwork from the Hellenized East: Catalogue of the Collections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UblDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=20 May 1993|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-0-89236-218-9|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BAB"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/927041/The_anchor_and_the_crown_Seleucos_use_of_the_anchor_coin_type_in_305_BC|title=The anchor and the crown: Seleucos&amp;#39; use of the&amp;quot; anchor&amp;quot; coin type in 305 BC|first=Borja|last=Antela-Bernardez|publisher=|journal=Athenaeum: Studi di letteratura e Storia|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anchor first appeared in reverses of coins with Alexander the Great's image in them.&lt;ref name="BAB"/&gt; Such coins with Alexander in them were very common in the [[Diadochi]] states.&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"/&gt; Origins of the anchor as a symbol is obscure, but there are several theories about the origin. For instance, it may commemorate Seleucus' career under Ptolemaic rule between 315 BC and 312 BC. Another theory is that the anchor was a form of propaganda aimed at merchants to lure them back into Northern Syrian cities and their new harbors built by Seleucus.&lt;ref name="BAB"/&gt;

After Seleucus I's death, his successors began to strike coins with their own image.&lt;ref name="Howgego2002"/&gt; Coins of the Seleucid Empire had imagery including a reigning king with a lion head dress, or [[Zeus]] on a throne with a sceptre and [[eagle]] in each hand. Certain coins portrayed a god or goddess, or in some cases they had a [[medusa]], a charging bull or an anchor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/seleucia/antiochos_I/t.html|title=Ancient Coinage of Seleucia, Antiochos I|website=www.wildwinds.com|access-date=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen1995"/&gt;

Coinage struck by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] can be considered to be iconographically innovative when compared to other Seleucid rulers.
He is associated with various celestial attributes and symbols such as stars and rays about his head. Both Antiochus IV and [[Seleucus IV Philopator]] struck coins with the solar deity [[Helios]]. Another deity closely associated with reign of these two rulers and brothers is [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/topoi_1161-9473_2009_num_16_1_2289|title=The cult of Helios in the Seleucid East|first1=Catharine|last1=Lorber|first2=Panagiotis|last2=Iossif|date=17 December 2017|publisher=|journal=Topoi|volume=16|issue=1|pages=19–42|accessdate=17 December 2017|doi=10.3406/topoi.2009.2289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serrated coins===
[[File:Seleucid serrate bronze coinage.png|thumb|Bronze coins with the typical bottle cap shape]]

Certain Seleucid bronze coinage have serrated edges,&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Mørkholm|title=Early Hellenistic Coinage from the Accession of Alexander to the Peace of Apamaea (336-188 BC)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_5Ez0kAOuIC&amp;pg=PA13|date=31 May 1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39504-5|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise rare in ancient coins.&lt;ref name="MacDonald2012"/&gt; They are sometimes called [[bottle cap]] coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancientpeddler.blogspot.com/2007/05/what-in-world-are-seleucids-or-bottle.html|title=Ancient Coin Cleaning And Restoration: What In The World Are Seleucids Or "Bottle Caps?"|first=|last=Jceaus|date=8 May 2007|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Self published source|date=December 2017}} Seleucid mints struck this type of bronze coinage within an approximate period of 187 BC–141 BC. This period was between reigns of [[Seleucus IV]] and [[Antiochus VI]].&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonald2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=George MacDonald|title=The Evolution of Coinage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gl2xtizf1OAC&amp;pg=PA68|date=22 March 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-60599-2|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a comparison, there are known instances of coins with serrated edges from the [[Kingdom of Macedon]] during reign of [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]]. Like in the Seleucid mints, the Macedonians did also somewhat quickly discard the process.&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"/&gt;

One theory is that the serrated edge made it easier to prove that the coin was solid metal. However, only the Seleucid bronze coinage, rather than coins of gold and silver, feature this sort of an edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://detritusofempire.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-mystery-coin-who-are-you.html|title=Detritus of Empire: A Mystery Coin - Who Are You?|first=Tim|last=Wolter|date=7 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Self published source|date=December 2017}} Certain Roman serrated [[denarii]] were especially designed to be harder to counterfeit or [[Methods of coin debasement|debase]]. However, the Roman efforts probably failed since there are silver plated copper denarii in existence. Seleucids are believed to not have serrated their coins as an anti-counterfeiting measure.&lt;ref name="StevensonMadden1889"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Seth William Stevenson|author2=Frederic William Madden|title=A Dictionary of Roman Coins, Republican and Imperial|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIAwAQAAMAAJ|year=1889|publisher=G. Bell and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syrian mints serrated their coins simply as a decorative method, and it is also possible that the Romans also sought only the aesthetic value.&lt;ref name="MacDonald2012"/&gt;

Sheppard''' (born 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viaf.org/processed/LC%7Cn%20%2098074796|title=LC Authority file|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is Dean and Charles E. Cantu Distinguished Professor of Law at [[St. Mary's University School of Law]], in the [[City of San Antonio]], Texas.  He teaches [[international law]], [[environmental law]], [[professional responsibility]], and [[legal history]]. His writings are often published under his familiar name, '''Steve Sheppard'''.

== Education ==

Sheppard received a B.A. in Political Science from the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] followed by a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]], [[L.L.M.]], and [[J.S.D.]] from [[Columbia University]].  He has also received a post-J.D. certificate in International Law from [[Columbia University]] and was made [[Master of Letters]] by [[Oxford University]].

==Scholarship==

Though active in other fields, Sheppard is a legal historian, with a focus on the development of the [[common law]] and of [[legal institutions]], particularly [[legal education in the United States]].  He was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]] especially for his work on early modern [[English law]], including his three-volume anthology, ''The Selected Writings of [[Sir Edward Coke]].'' He is also a member of the [[Selden Society]].  His work in the law has been widely cited by courts including the [[Utah Supreme Court]], (in ''State v. Reyes'', 116 P.3d 305 (2005)) it changed the burden of proof for felonies in Utah citing Sheppard's law review article, ''The Metamorphoses of Reasonable Doubt: How Changes in the Burden of Proof Have Weakened the Presumption of Innocence'', as its only academic authority. He wrote a new edition of the great American legal dictionary by [[John Bouvier]], ''[[The Wolters Kluwer Bouvier Law Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/The_Wolters_Kluwer_Bouvier_Law_Dictionar.html?id=UfVYvgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y | title=The Wolters Kluwer Bouvier Law Dictionary | publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]] |first1=Steve|last1=Sheppard|first2=John|last2=Bouvier | year=2012 | pages=3236}}&lt;/ref&gt; An active scholarly editor, he has prepared new editions of several classic lawbooks, including the massive ''Opera Omnia'' of [[John Selden]] and the modern classics, ''Bramble Bush'' by [[Karl Llewellyn]] and ''Introduction to the Legal System of the United States'' by [[E. Allan Farnsworth]].  His most innovative work combines legal history with [[legal philosophy]] and the practical demands of legal practice, ''I Do Solemnly Swear: The Moral Obligations of legal Officials''.

==Professional career==
A member of the [[State Bar of Texas]] and the [[Mississippi Bar]], Sheppard is admitted to practice before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], and the [[U.S. Tax Court]].

Until 2014, he was the William H. Enfield Distinguished Professor of Law at the [[University of Arkansas School of Law]], where he was also the Associate Dean for Research and Faculty Development.

The land of '''Subartu''' (Akkadian ''Šubartum/Subartum/ina Šú-ba-ri'', Assyrian ''[[Kur|mât]] Šubarri'') or '''Subar''' (Sumerian Su-bir&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Subar/Šubur) is mentioned in [[Bronze Age literature]]. The name also appears as ''Subari'' in the [[Amarna letters]], and, in the form ''Šbr'', in [[Ugarit]].

Subartu was apparently a polity in [[Upper Mesopotamia]], at the upper [[Tigris]]. Most scholars suggest that ''Subartu'' is an early name for [[Assyria]] proper on the Tigris and westward, although there are various other theories placing it sometimes a little farther to the east and/or north. Its precise location has not been identified. 
From the point of view of the [[Akkadian Empire]], Subartu marked the northern geographical horizon, just as [[Amorites|Martu]], [[Elam]] and [[Sumer]] marked "west", "east" and "south", respectively.

== History ==
The Sumerian mythological epic ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]'' lists the countries where the "languages are confused" as Subartu, [[Hamazi]], [[Sumer]], Uri-ki ([[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]), and the Martu land (the [[Amorites]]). Similarly, the earliest references to the "four quarters" by the kings of Akkad name Subartu as one of these quarters around Akkad, along with Martu, [[Elam]], and Sumer.  Subartu in the earliest texts seem to have been farming mountain dwellers, frequently raided for slaves.

[[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]] was said to have smitten Subartu or Shubur, and it was listed as a province of the empire of [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]]; in a later era [[Sargon of Akkad]] campaigned against Subar, and his grandson [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] listed Subar along with [[Armani (kingdom)|Armani]], which has been identified with [[Aleppo]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P8fl8BXpR0MC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=ebla+arman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JdZsdIP7O4&amp;sig=ag_zXHPCttBHmSO-ssFQvsFrwLI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ThadT56SJcyJrAezmJBa&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ebla%20arman&amp;f=false Wayne Horowitz, ''Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography'', Eisenbrauns 1998] {{ISBN|0-931464-99-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; among the lands under his control. [[Ishbi-Erra]] of [[Isin]] and [[Hammurabi]] also claimed victories over Subar.

Three of the 14th-century BC [[Amarna letters]] – Akkadian cuneiform correspondence found in Egypt – mention ''Subari'' as a toponym.  All are addressed to [[Akhenaten]]; in two (EA 108 and 109), [[Rib-Hadda]], king of [[Byblos]], complains that [[Abdi-Ashirta]], ruler of Amurru, had sold captives to Subari, while another (EA 100), from the city of [[Arqa|Irqata]], also alludes to having transferred captured goods to Subari.

There is also a mention of "Subartu" in the 8th century BC ''Poem of [[Erra (god)|Erra]]'' (IV, 132), along with other lands that have harassed Babylonia.&lt;ref&gt;BOTTERO  Jean, KRAMER Samuel Noah, ''Lorsque les dieux faisaient l'homme'', Gallimard, Paris, 1989, p.704.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] times (under [[Nabopolassar]], [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and [[Nabonidus]]).

==Identity==

{{Expand section|date=May 2012}}

Subartu may have been in the general sphere of influence of the [[Hurrians]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein J.J. (1955), "Subartu and Subarians in Old Babylonian Sources" (Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol 9, No.1)&lt;/ref&gt; There are various alternate theories associating the ancient ''Subartu'' with one or more modern cultures found in the region, including the [[Armenians]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n1TmVvMwmo4C&amp;lpg=PA276 ''Cambridge Ancient History'' p.276]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00004/37200.htm?text=%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B0 ''Armenians'' article, Great Soviet Encyclopedia]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kurdish scholar [[Mehrdad Izady]], claims to have identified Subartu with the current [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] tribe of Zebari/Zubari/Zibaris inhabiting the northern ring north of Erbil, east of Mosul up to [[Hakkari]] in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=I9mr6OgLjBoC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=zibari+izady#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Kurds: A concise handbook | isbn = 978-0-8448-1727-9 | author1 = Izady | first1 = Mehrdad R | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amarna letters corpus==
Subartu (''Subaru'' of the letters) is a toponym mentioned in the [[Amarna letters]] (14th century BC); the letters were written in the short period approximately from [[1350 BC|1350]]–[[1335 BC]]. It is commonly accepted that the region referenced was Subartu.

Subartu is only referenced in three of the Amarna letters: EA 100, 108, and EA 109. All three letters state that people, or 'items' are needed to be sold in Subaru, for money.

===The letters referencing region ''Subartu''===

''Subaru'' of the letters is only referenced in three Amarna letters, and with no links to any rulers of Subaru.

The following are the letters referencing Subartu:
:EA 100&amp;mdash;Title: "The city of Irqata to the king" -See [[Arqa]], Amarna letters ''Irqata''
:EA 108&amp;mdash;Title: "Unheard-of deeds" -letter of [[Rib-Hadda]]
:EA 109&amp;mdash;Title: "Then and now" -letter of Rib-Hadda

====EA 108, "Unheard-of deeds"====
:"[[Rib-Hadda]] writes to his lord, king of all countries, [[Great King]], [[King of Battle]]: May the [[Ba‘alat Gebal|Lady of Gubla]] grant power to the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of my lord, my Sun, 7 times and 7 times. Moreover, is it pleasing in the sight of the king, who is like [[Baal]] and [[Shamash|Šamaš]] in the sky, that the sons of [[Abdi-Ashirta|'Abdi-Aširta]] do as they please? They have taken the king's horses and [[chariot]]s, and they have sold ''into captivity, charioteers: ši-x-y(?)'' and soldiers to ((to))-(emphasis?) the land of ''Su(ba)ru''. In whose lifetime has such a deed been done? False words are now being spoken in the presence of the king, the Sun. I am your loyal servant, and whatever I know or have heard I write to the king, my lord. Wh[o] are they, the [[Dog (Amarna letters appellation)|dogs]], that they could ''res[ist]'' the [[Pítati|archers]] of the king, the Sun? I wrote t[o] ((to))-(emphasis?) your father-(i.e. [[Amenhotep III]]), and he he[eded] my wor[d]s, and he sent ar[ch]ers. Did he not take 'Abdi-Aširta for ''h[imself]''? Moreover, since the mayors have not oppo[sed] th[em], they are stron[g]. The army furnishes whatever they ne[ed], and so they are not afra[id] of the magnate. Because they have taken the hors[es], they are bold. Because we know that they are strong, we have ''to(ld)'' the king, "They are strong," Truly, they will not prevail. When I sent 2 [[Courier|messengers]] to [[Zemar|Sumur]]-([[Zemar]]), I retained this man in order to report to the king. Moreover, why do you listen to other men? The king's messengers must bring (news) by night and bring (it) back by night because of the [[Dog (Amarna letters appellation)|dog]]. If the king, the Sun, desires, they will be taken in a day. Moreover, has he [n]o[t] ''plotted'' evils [''upon evils a]gainst'' you, and ''rev[olted?'' A]nd as for the man of [''my''] ''god'', [[Habiru|'Apiru]] came from Sumur to take him prisoner, but I did not give him up. May the [k]ing he[ed] the words of his servant. Send me [2]0 men from [[Meluhha]] and 20 men from Egypt-(named 'Mizri'-see [[Mizraim]]), to guard the city for the king, the Sun, my lord. (I am)-''Your loyal se[rvan]t''.  -EA 108, lines 1-69 (complete)

The '''Trevithick Society''' is a registered charity named for [[Richard Trevithick]], a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] engineer who contributed to the use of high pressure [[steam engine]]s for transportation and mining applications.

==History==
In 1935 the Cornish Engines Preservation Committee (CEPC) was formed to rescue the [[Levant Mine and Beam Engine|Levant winding engine]] which was deemed outdated and scheduled to be scrapped. CEPC were forerunners in the field of [[Industrial Archaeology]]. They acquired another winding engine and two [[Cornish engine|pumping engines]]. CEPC merged with the newly formed Cornish Waterwheel Preservation Society in 1971 and named the organisation the Trevithick Society after Richard Trevithick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open-lectures.co.uk/Industrial-Archaeology-Societies/2918-Trevithick-Society-The/View-details.html ''Trevithick Society.''] Open Lectures and Talks.

===Dolcoath pumping engine===
[[Dolcoath mine|Dolcoath]] was the largest and deepest mine in Cornwall, with its principal shaft, known as New Sump Shaft, eventually reaching a depth of {{convert|3300|ft|m}} below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, T.

Penzance: Alison Hodge. p.52. {{ISBN|0-906720-11-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The pumping engine that worked this shaft dated from 1815; a piece of the [[cast iron]] bob from this engine is preserved in the collection of the Trevithick Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trevithick-society.org.uk/collection/0063.htm |title=Perran foundry beam |publisher=The Trevithick Society |accessdate=26 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811074117/http://www.trevithick-society.org.uk/collection/0063.htm |archivedate=11 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial''' is a [[memorial]] over a group burial site at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in the [[United States]]. It commemorates the victims of [[the Pentagon]], which was struck by [[al-Qaeda]] [[Terrorism|terrorists]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. The memorial specifically honors the five individuals for whom no identifiable remains were found.&lt;ref name="Cass" /&gt; However, a portion of the remains of 25 other victims are buried at the site.&lt;ref name="Honors" /&gt; The names of the 115 Pentagon employees and 10 contractors in the building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=September 11, A Memorial: Pentagon|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/lists/by-location/page88.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 53 passengers and six crew members aboard [[American Airlines Flight 77]] (which crashed into the building) are inscribed on the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=September 11, A Memorial: AA Flight 77|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/lists/by-location/page96.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Creation==
[[File:USS Serpens Memorial - Arlington National Cemetery - west view - 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial to the 253 dead of the ''USS Serpens'', which inspired the Pentagon victims' memorial.]]
After the 2001 terrorist attack on the Pentagon, Arlington National Cemetery Superintendent [[John C. Metzler, Jr.]] realized that there was a strong likelihood that many of the victims might not have their remains identified, while other remains might be commingled.&lt;ref name="Wilbert"&gt;{{cite web |title=9/12 – A New Day to Remember |url=http://www.eloquentarrow.com/pdfs/gallery/9_12.pdf|publisher=Wilbert Funeral Services|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=February 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the victims would be military personnel whose families could choose to have their loved ones buried at Arlington. This would necessitate a group burial at the cemetery, and an appropriate monument to mark the grave.

Metzler designed the memorial himself.  He drew inspiration from the memorial to the 253 dead of the [[United States Coast Guard]] ship [[USS Serpens (AK-97)|USS ''Serpens'']], which is located in the northern corner of Section 34 at Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref name="Wilbert" /&gt; The ''Serpens'' memorial is octagonal in shape and lists the names of the dead on its side panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Book of Knowledge|year=1989|publisher=Grolier Inc|location=Danbury, Conn|isbn=0-7172-0520-7|page=26|quote=It was dedicated on November 16, 1950.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial is a pentagonal [[granite]] marker {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name="Pusey"&gt;{{cite news |title=Final Service Honors Victims of Pentagon Attack |first= Allen|last= Pusey|newspaper=Dallas Morning News|date=September 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cass"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cass|first=Connie|title=Cremated Remains of Pentagon Victims Are Laid to Rest at National Cemetery|date=September 13, 2002|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On five sides of the memorial along the top are inscribed the words "Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon September 11, 2001". [[Aluminum]] plaques, painted black, are inscribed with the names of the 184 victims of the terrorist attack.&lt;ref name="Cass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KnoxNews"&gt;{{cite news|title=America Remembers: Sept. 11th Photo Gallery|url=http://web.knoxnews.com/advertising/wtc/2908.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]|date=August 20, 2002|quote=There is some confusion over the nature of the plaques. In this photo, the Associated Press said the plaques were bronze; however, many of the other sources say that they are aluminum.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are five plaques, one for each side of the marker.&lt;ref name="Pusey" /&gt; The names of those aboard Flight 77 are marked with a diamond in front of their name.  The names of those for whom no remains could be identified are marked with a star in front of their name. A pentagonal base extends approximately {{convert|5|in|cm}} out and {{convert|5|in|cm}} down from the main body of the memorial.

The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] commissioned the memorial.&lt;ref name="KnoxNews"/&gt; Granite Industries of Vermont, Inc., of [[Washington County, Vermont]], provided the marker.&lt;ref name="Mehren"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mehren |first=Elizabeth |title=Headstone Carvers Find Ages of the Fallen Hard to Take at Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/sep/14/nation/na-stones14|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The company is also the sole provider of headstones for Arlington National Cemetery.)&lt;ref name="Mehren" /&gt; The stone was quarried near [[Danby, Vermont]], at a site {{convert|920|ft|m}} underground and {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} inside a mountain.&lt;ref name="Mehren" /&gt; Michael E. Cappetta, a stoneworker with Granite Industries, sculpted the marker.&lt;ref name="Pusey" /&gt; It was shipped on or about August 20, 2002, to the cemetery.&lt;ref name="KnoxNews" /&gt;

==Identification of the dead==
Identifying remains at the Pentagon was a lengthy and technically complex task.  The speed at which the aircraft struck the building, as well as the intensity of the subsequent fire, left few human remains to be found.&lt;ref name="VogelNever"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Steve|title=Lost and, Sometimes, Never Found|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/never-found.htm|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the fire severely damaged the [[DNA]] in some remains that they were impossible to identify.&lt;ref name="VogelNever" /&gt;

[[File:Victims of the Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial - burial vault cover - Arlington National Cemetery - 2002-09-12.jpg|thumb|right|The inscribed cover of the burial vault beneath the monument, on display during the funeral service.]]
However, DNA analysis helped to identify many of the dead. Human remains were taken to a military mortuary at [[Dover Air Force Base]] in [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name="VogelFacing" /&gt; The [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]] conducted the DNA analysis.&lt;ref name="Struggle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials struggle with decisions on remains of hijackers|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2002/09/11/nat_351973.shtml|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[The Augusta Chronicle]]|date=September 11, 2002|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polymerase chain reaction]] was used to amplify the amount of usable DNA.  The [[United States Department of Defense]] had previously collected "bloodstain cards" from all its civilian and military employees, and the DNA on these cards was used to identify many remains.&lt;ref name="MurrayLost"&gt;{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Frank J.|title=Remembering lives of Pentagon's 'lost' |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91001656.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=September 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Families of those aboard Flight 77 provided DNA samples (from commonplace household items like combs or toothbrushes) for use in identifying their loved ones.&lt;ref name="Cass" /&gt;

Not all the victims of the terrorist attack on the Pentagon qualified for burial at Arlington National Cemetery. Families of those who did often chose to bury the remains of their loved ones at a private cemetery.  Sixty-four individuals who died at the Pentagon were buried at Arlington, and 57 of them were interred in Section 64,&lt;ref name="VogelNever" /&gt; their headstones facing the Pentagon about {{convert|1100|ft|m}} away to the southeast (visible through a few trees).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Dean E.|title=A Single Grief Knits Together A Vast Country |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/12/us/vigilance-memory-observances-single-grief-knits-together-vast-country.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 12, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No remains could be identified for five victims:&lt;ref name="Cass" /&gt;
#Dana Falkenberg, age three, who was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 with her parents and older sister.
#Ronald Golinski, age 60, a civilian worker at the Pentagon and a former colonel of the [[United States Army]].
#Electronics Technician 1st Class Ronald Hemenway of the [[United States Navy]], age 37.
#James T. Lynch, age 55, a civilian video technician for the United States Navy.
#Rhonda Rasmussen, age 44, a civilian worker for the United States Army.

In some cases, additional remains were discovered and identified after a person had already been buried by their families.  Some families chose to add these remains to an existing grave.  But 25 families chose to have these fragments interred during the group burial rather than disinter their loved ones or hold a second memorial service.&lt;ref name="Cass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VogelFacing" /&gt; The additional remains were cremated, mixed together, and placed in an urn which in turn was placed inside a single wooden coffin.&lt;ref name="Honors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arlington funeral honors unidentified victims|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-09-12/us/ar911.pentagon.funeral_1_dana-falkenberg-ronald-golinski-victims?_s=PM:US|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=September 12, 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010232903/http://articles.cnn.com/2002-09-12/us/ar911.pentagon.funeral_1_dana-falkenberg-ronald-golinski-victims?_s=PM%3AUS|archive-date=10 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Five sets of remains were found but could not be identified.  Military officials say that, by a process of elimination, they believed these remains to be those of the hijackers.&lt;ref name="VogelFacing"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vogel |first=Steve|title=Facing the Scene of Disaster; 9/11 Service Planned at Rebuilt Pentagon Wall, But Pain Will Keep Some Victims' Families Away |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/158054921.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+1%2C+2002&amp;author=Steve+Vogel&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C.01&amp;desc=Facing+the+Scene+of+Disaster%3B+9%2F11+Service+Planned+at+Rebuilt+Pentagon+Wall%2C+But+Pain+Will+Keep+Some+Victims%27+Families+Away|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Struggle" /&gt; [[United States Army Military District of Washington|Army Military District of Washington]] officials said the remains which were inextricably commingled were excluded from the burial so that there was no possibility that any terrorist remains were included.&lt;ref name="Honors" /&gt; These terrorist and commingled remains were turned over to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) in February 2002.&lt;ref name="Struggle" /&gt; The FBI said the remains were "disposed of in a dignified manner'",&lt;ref name="VogelNever" /&gt; although a very small amount of suspected terrorist remains were retained to aid in later criminal prosecutions.&lt;ref name="Struggle" /&gt;

==Dedication==

The Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial was dedicated on September 12, 2002.&lt;ref name="Cass" /&gt;

A funeral service for the 30 victims was held at the [[Arlington Memorial Amphitheater]], the first time the amphitheater had held such a service since the interment of an unknown member of the armed forces representing Vietnam War dead in 1984.&lt;ref name="VogelFacing" /&gt; About 1,000 relatives attended the funeral service.&lt;ref name="Cass" /&gt; The funeral was held the day after the one-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks.  Many of these families felt the emotional strain was too much for two days of remembrances, and so chose not to attend the funeral.&lt;ref name="VogelNever" /&gt; The September 12 funeral focused on the families of five victims whose remains could not be identified, although all victims were memorialized.&lt;ref name="VogelFacing" /&gt; [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and chaplains from each branch of the United States armed forces spoke, and [[United States Air Force]] General [[Richard Myers]], chairman of the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], attended.&lt;ref name="Cass" /&gt; The [[United States Navy Band]] provided music.&lt;ref name="Garamone"&gt;{{cite news|last=Garamone|first=Jim|title=Remains of Pentagon Attack Victims Buried at Arlington |url=http://osd.dtic.mil/news/Sep2002/n09122002_200209123.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=DefenseLINK News|date=September 12, 2002|agency=[[American Forces Press Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the funeral, the casket was carried from the amphitheater by an Armed Forces casket team composed of two representatives from each of the four branches of the United States military.&lt;ref name="VogelNever" /&gt; The casket team carried the coffin to a horse-drawn [[Limbers and caissons|caisson]] provided by and guided by the [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)]].&lt;ref name="Garamone" /&gt; The [[United States Army Band]], an Army-Air Force [[honor guard]] [[platoon]], a [[color guard]] from all four services, and a Navy-[[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] honor guard platoon led the caisson to the grave site.&lt;ref name="VogelNever" /&gt;

The group burial site is located at the southern end of Section 64, near Patton Circle.  The site is on a slight rise, which gives it a view of the Pentagon.&lt;ref name="Cass" /&gt; Several hundred people attended the graveside service.&lt;ref name="Cass" /&gt; Wilbert Funeral Services of [[Laurel, Maryland]], provided a burial vault.  The grave was dug several days in advance, a [[concrete]] foundation for the memorial laid, and a specially-constructed [[Burial vault (enclosure)|burial vault]] placed on the foundation.&lt;ref name="Wilbert" /&gt; The vault had a concrete core surrounded by three layers of bronze.&lt;ref name="Wilbert" /&gt; It was lined with high-impact plastic, and the exterior encased in [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS plastic]] to simulate marble.&lt;ref name="Wilbert" /&gt; The seal of the U.S. Department of Defense and the name of the memorial was inscribed on the cover of the burial vault using a special process.&lt;ref name="Wilbert" /&gt; Near the grave was the memorial itself, next to which was displayed a funeral wreath in the shape of a pentagon and made from 184 red carnations.&lt;ref name="VogelNever" /&gt;

A rifle party gave a [[three-volley salute]], and a [[bugle]]r provided by the Navy played ''[[Taps]]''.&lt;ref name="VogelNever" /&gt; The casket team secured and folded the American flag while the Army Band played ''[[America the Beautiful]]''.&lt;ref name="VogelNever" /&gt; General Myers accepted the flag on behalf of the Pentagon.&lt;ref name="Garamone" /&gt; Grief counselors from Operation Solace (a group founded to assist the families of victims of the 9/11 attacks) were present to assist families after the service.&lt;ref name="Pusey" /&gt;

The memorial was installed over the group burial site about a week later.&lt;ref name="Cass" /&gt; The burial vault was locked, concrete was poured over the vault to fill the grave, and the memorial emplaced once the concrete set.

Ponsford, Ltd., a company which provides conservation and curatorial services, maintains the monument and keeps it clean (as it does for all the monuments at Arlington National Cemetery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pentagon Victims Memorial |url=http://www.statueconservation.com/conservation_restoration/pentagon.htm|publisher=Ponsford Ltd|accessdate=31 October 2012|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[File:Arlington National Cemetery - 9-11 Memorial to Pentagon Victims - SW side with tombstones - 2011.jpg|thumb|The memorial days before the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.]]
The monument has not received much attention.  A critic for ''[[The Washington Times]]'', however, approvingly called it a "five-sided [[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|Rock of Ages]]".&lt;ref name="MurrayLost" /&gt; [[Paul Goldberger]], architecture critic for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, was more cautious. By inscribing the name of each victim, he said, the memorial risks becoming a private monument rather than a monument belonging to the entire nation or a symbol of something larger than an individual person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Planners Seek to Communicate Beyond Grief to Next Generation |first=Kyle |last=MacMillan |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|date= August 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
On June 20, 2014, a man committed suicide by shooting himself near the Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial. Dozens of police vehicles from the Arlington County Police Department, cemetery security, Fort Myer security, and other federal agencies converged on the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/06/20/man-kills-himself-at-arlington-national-cemetery.html|last=McGarry|first=Brendan|title=Man Kills Himself at Arlington National Cemetery|website=Military.com|date=June 20, 2014|accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cemetery officials said there were no eyewitnesses to the suicide, but were unable to ascertain if he was a veteran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/man-dies-of-self-inflicted-gunshot-at-arlington-cemetery/2014/06/20/642d5410-f890-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html|last=St. Martin|first=Victoria|title=Man Dies of Self-Inflicted Gunshot at Arlington Cemetery|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 20, 2014|accessdate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Brombert was born in [[Berlin]] in 1923 into a well-to-do Russian-Jewish family that had fled Russia at the outbreak of the Revolution and settled in [[Leipzig]]. When Hitler came to power in Germany, the family left for Paris, and Brombert received his secondary education at the [[Lycée Janson-de-Sailly]]. As the German army advanced on Paris in 1940, the family fled to the unoccupied zone under the control of the Vichy government and a year later, in 1941, escaped via Spain to the United States.

In May 1943 Brombert was drafted into the U.S. army. Due to his fluency in French, German, and Russian he was placed in a special unit, composed chiefly of refugees from Nazi-occupied European countries, that was trained in front-line military intelligence at [[Fort Ritchie|Camp Ritchie, Maryland]], and featured in a documentary film "The [[Ritchie Boys]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435725/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritchieboys.com/EN/boys_brombert.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docurama.com/docurama/the-ritchie-boys/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.tvguide.com/The+Ritchie+Boys/The+Ritchie+Boys/8150782?autoplay=true&amp;partnerid=OVG]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 he took part in the Normandy landings with the 2nd Armored Division at [[Omaha Beach]] and also saw action with the 28th Infantry Division in the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. After the war, Brombert studied at Yale University, where he received a B.A. in 1948 and a Ph.D. in Romance Languages and Literatures in 1953. As a graduate student, he was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship (1950–51) to study in Rome, adding Italian to the languages in which he has native fluency. He is married to Beth Archer Brombert, a translator from French and Italian, and the author of the biographies ''Cristina: Portraits of a Princess'' and ''Édouard Manet: Rebel in a Frock Coat''. The Bromberts have two children, Lauren and Marc.

==Academic career==

On completion of his graduate studies Brombert joined the Yale Department of Romance Languages and Literatures. He was appointed Benjamin F. Barge Professor in 1968 and was chair of his Department from 1964 to 1973. In 1975 he moved to Princeton, where he had been appointed Henry Putnam University Professor and was affiliated with the Departments of Comparative Literature and Romance Languages and Literatures. At Princeton, he was also Director of Princeton's Christian Gauss Seminars in Criticism and chairman of its Council of the Humanities. He entered emeritus status in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/fit/people/display_person.xml?netid=brombert Princeton biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brombert has been a visiting professor at many universities in the U.S. and Europe: the University of California (Berkeley), the Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, New York University, the University of Colorado, the Scuola Normale Superiore (Pisa, Italy), the Collège de France (Paris), the University of Bologna, the University of Puerto Rico.

==Awards==

Brombert has held fellowships from the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (1967) and from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] (1954–55; 1970). He was [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Visiting Scholar in 1986-87 and 1989–90, and a scholar-in-residence at the Rockefeller Foundation in [[Bellagio, Italy]] in 1975 and in 1990. He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1974, and to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1987. He holds honorary degrees from the [[University of Chicago]] (Doctor of Humane Letters, 1981) and the [[University of Toronto]] (Doctor of Laws, 1997). In 1985 he was awarded the Wilbur Cross Medal of the Yale Alumni Association for "distinguished achievements in scholarship, teaching, academic administration, and public service.” In France, he was honored with the Médaille Vermeil de la Ville de Paris " (1985) and was made ''[[Palmes Académiques|Commandeur des Palmes Académiques]]'' (2008) and ''[[Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur]]'' (2009).

In 1988-89 he served as president of the [[Modern Language Association]].

==Publications==

Brombert’s work is primarily on 19th and 20th century [[French literature]], and also on the [[history of ideas]]; the theory of literary criticism; and comparative studies of Italian, Russian, and German narrative writers. In addition to his books, he has contributed to edited volumes and written journal articles on French writers from Pascal to Malraux, Sartre, and Camus, and on many non-French writers: Dostoevsky, Gogol, Tolstoy; Büchner, Max Frisch, Kafka, Thomas Mann; Giorgio Bassani, Primo Levi, Italo Svevo; J. M. Coetzee, Virginia Woolf.

Brombert is also the author of a memoir, ''Trains of Thought: Memories of a Stateless Youth'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 2002; paperback, Anchor Books, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Trains of Thought'' by [[Frank Kermode]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Trains of Thought'' by [[Richard Howard]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/30/books/engine-of-escape.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently working on a sequel, to be entitled ''The Sabbatical Years''.
 
In the words of a reviewer in ''The Wall Street Journal'' (December 27, 2013), “Victor Brombert...has been for more than 50 years one of the glories of humanistic scholarship at Yale and Princeton. Though a generation younger than scholarly patriarchs like Erich Auerbach and Leo Spitzer, Mr. Brombert has nonetheless shown himself comparably learned and cosmopolitan in his studies...”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11804">'''Vietnamese ceramics''' refers to [[ceramic art]] and [[pottery]] as a form of [[Vietnamese art]]. Vietnamese pottery and ceramics has a long history spanning back to thousands of years ago, including long before [[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]], as archeological evidence supports.

Much of Vietnamese pottery and ceramics after the Chinese-domination era was largely influenced by [[Chinese ceramics]], but has developed over time to be distinctly Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/1194 The Evolution of Vietnamese Ceramics : ThingsAsian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930152448/http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/1194 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese potters combined indigenous and Chinese elements. They also experimented with both original and individual styles as well as incorporated features from other cultures, such as [[Cambodia]], [[India]] and [[Champa]].&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=59|url=http://artsbma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnamese ceramics were an essential part of the trade between Vietnam and its neighbors during pre-modern times through all the dynasties.

== Cát Tiên ==
[[File:Cattien pottery burial jar 2.png|thumb|''Mộ vò gốm'', a ceramic burial jar from Cát Tiên in south Vietnam (4th-9th century CE)]]
The [[Cát Tiên archaeological site]] in south Vietnam is site located in [[Cát Tiên National Park]]. Accidentally discovered in 1985, this site ranges from Quảng Ngãi Commune to Đức Phổ Commune, with the main archaeological artefacts concentrating in Quảng Ngãi, Cát Tiên District, Lâm Đồng Province, southern Tây Nguyên. The unknown civilization which developed this site inhabited it between the 4th century and 9th centuries CE. A number of ceramic ware was found in this site.

== Bát Tràng ==
[[Bát Tràng porcelain]] and pottery is a type of [[ceramic]]s made in the village of [[Bát Tràng]], now merged into suburban Hanoi. The village is located in an area rich in clay suitable for making fine ceramic. Bát Tràng ceramics were esteemed with products rivaling that of [[Chu Đậu]], and later joined by pottery from [[Đồng Nai Province|Đồng Nai]], [[Phu Lang]], and [[Ninh Thuận Province|Ninh Thuận]]. The history of pottery production in the village can be traced back as far as the 14th century CE, and in subsequent centuries having been a popular manufactured product extensively traded by local merchants as well as European trading ships throughout Southeast Asia and the Far East. Bát Tràng nowadays still continues producing bowls, dishes and vases not only for the local market but also for exporting to Japan, one of the important market of Vietnamese ceramics. The gas kiln is more and more popular than electric or tradition wooden kiln. Beside the traditional decoration technique by brush, it appears recently the decoration technique using screen printing on rice paper. The new technique is applied mainly for the producing religious products like incense burners. But all other processes of making vessels are still very much handmade which is very important. There is another beautiful thing of Bát Tràng that is the old family houses. It is left only two or three this kind of old house which still keep the spirit of old Bat Trang, where it is found  the big size vases, or bows with the decorations from the 14th century, the most  popular period of Bat Trang Ceramics.  

Another impressive type of ceramics is found in Bat Trang during the Nguyen dynasty (1802-1945) is "gốm hoa nâu", brown patterned ceramics. It has a long history in Vietnam, appeared from the Ly dynasty (1010-1225)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnamese Brown and Patterned Ceramics|last=|first=|publisher=National Museum of Vietnamese History|year=2005|isbn=|location=Hanoi, Vietnam|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are different techniques and products produced at different periods. During the Early Le dynasty (1428-1527), brown patterned was used with other colors. During the Mac dynasty (1527-1592), it was found majority on candle-holders and incense burners. During the Nguyen dynasty (1802-1954), it appeared on very fine Bat Trang flower pots.

== An'nan ==

The trade in Vietnamese ceramics was damaged due to the plummet in trade by Cham merchants after the [[1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa]].&lt;ref name="SchottenhammerPtak2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Angela Schottenhammer|author2=Roderich Ptak|title=The Perception of Maritime Space in Traditional Chinese Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9rWcNu89kgC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=tran+dynasty+fujian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qocmy6H20G&amp;sig=2wJ5lOBzqz5FkR3lOM9oZSSXItA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo76b164TKAhUBlB4KHSr0C6IQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=tran%20dynasty%20fujian&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05340-2|pages=138–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam's export of ceramics was also damaged by its internal civil war, the Portuguese and Spanish entry into the region and the Portuguese conquest of Malacca which caused an upset in the trading system, while the carracks ships in the Malacca to Macao trade run by the Portuguese docked at Brunei due to good relations between the Portuguese and Brunei after the Chinese permitted Macao to be leased to the Portuguese.&lt;ref name="BùiLong2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Minh Trí Bùi|author2=Kerry Nguyễn Long|title=Vietnamese Blue &amp; White Ceramics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxjWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+arrival+of+the+Spanish+in+Brunei+and+the+Philippines+in+force+in+the+sixteenth+century+initiated+the+same+kind+of+...&amp;dq=The+arrival+of+the+Spanish+in+Brunei+and+the+Philippines+in+force+in+the+sixteenth+century+initiated+the+same+kind+of+...&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjarMfJh5LKAhUBbSYKHb7SBmsQ6AEIJDAC|year=2001|publisher=Khoa học xã hội|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the so-called [[Nanban trade]] in the 16th-17th century, fragments of Vietnamese ceramic were found in a northern part of [[Kyūshū]] island. Among them was a wooden plate with character showing the date 1330 on it. Whether the Japanese went to Vietnam or Vietnamese traders came to Japan or if it all went through China is not quite clear. Vietnamese history records showed that when Lord [[Nguyễn Hoàng]] founded [[Hội An]] port at the beginning of the 17th century, hundreds of Japanese residents were already there.

One of the more famous items is [[Annam (Chinese province)|An'nan]] ware (安南焼), which was exported to Japan and used in [[List of Japanese tea ceremony equipment|Japanese tea ceremony]] although the high-footed bowls were originally used for food. The bowls had an everted rim, high foot, were underglazed with cobalt floral decorations, lappets above base, unglazed stacking rings in well and were brown washed on the base. The diameters can range from 9 to 15 centimetres. They were produced in the 16th and 17th century.

== Hội An wreck ==
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 87 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Blue-and-white ceramic lampstand, and phoenix-shaped vase ewers dated to the [[Early Lê dynasty]], 15th century. Provenance Chu Đậu [[kiln]], Hải Dương province]]
The [[Hội An wreck]] lies 22 miles off the coast of central Vietnam in the South China Sea. The ship was carrying a large cargo of Vietnamese ceramics from the mid- to late-15th century. The provenance of the pieces was known to be the kilns of the Red River Delta (such as [[Chu Đậu]]) because excavations in the region had been ongoing since their discovery in 1983. The only pieces remaining at the kiln sites were wasters (pieces that had fused, collapsed or exploded in the firing process). Intact examples of the wares produced were rare, since all were exported. When the wreck was found there was excitement among collectors and archaeologists, for it promised the first cargo consisting solely of Vietnamese wares.

In 1996 over 250,000 intact examples of Vietnamese ceramic were recovered. 10% of unique ware was kept by the government for national museums, while the rest was allowed to be auctioned off to pay for recovery costs.

== Modern ceramics ==
While ceramic ware in the traditional style is still being produced and enjoys popularity, increasingly modern ceramics are produced for export. Centres of ceramic production include [[Lái Thiêu]] in Southern Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Khánh Chương Trà̂n Gó̂m Việt Nam - 2001 Page 165 "In the late 1950s, a similar kind of pottery was manufactured at Lái Thiêu but with a graver tone of enamel named ... In terms of ornamental style, Lái Thiêu pottery is not much different from Bien Hôa ceramics but it has its own beauty, grave ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam Fine Arts Museum - Page 104 Bảo tàng mỹ thuật Việt Nam - 2000 "Another sort of Ceramics was produced by Phủ Lãng, Quế Quyển ovens (northern Vietnam), Bảo Vinh (central Vietnam), Lái Thiêu ( southern Vietnam). They might have come into being very early and were rather well developed in this ...&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the noteworthy examples of modern ceramic art is the [[Hanoi Ceramic Mosaic Mural]], which is affixed on the wall of the dyke system of Hanoi. With a length of about 4&amp;nbsp;km, the Ceramic Road is one of the major projects that were developed on the occasion of the [[Millennial Anniversary of Hanoi]].

[[File:The grave of Count Valerian Krasinski, Warriston Cemetery.JPG|thumb|The grave of Count Valerian Krasinski, Warriston Cemetery]]

Count '''Walerian Skorobohaty Krasiński''' or '''Valerian Krasinski''' (1795– 22 December 1855) was a Polish Calvinist politician, nationalist and historian.

Krasinski was a Polish aristocrat in exile after the [[November Uprising]] 1830, during the Austrian, German and Russian [[partition of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Sugar ''Nationality and society in Habsburg and Ottoman Europe'' reprint of article from 1967&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, he was proposed for a chair in Slavonic Studies at Oxford University. In 1848, he presented appeals to the Habsburg government. In ''Russia and Europe, or, The probable consequences of the present war'' he wrote on the [[Crimean War]].

Krasinski's ''Historical sketch of the rise, progress, and decline of the Reformation in Poland'' (1838) still one of main texts on the subject available in English, was written in English. One of Krasinski's main sources is ''Slavonia reformata'' (1679) by [[Andrzej Węgierski|Andreas Vengerscius]].&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Wilczek ''Jesuits in Poland according to A.F. Pollard'' a review of A. F. Pollard, The Jesuits in Poland. [The Lothian Essay, 1892] New York. Haskell House Publishers Ltd. Publishers of Scarce Scholarly Books. 1971. 98 pages. Hardcover.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Edinburgh]] and is buried in the [[Warriston Cemetery]] close to another Polish exile, the violinist and composer [[Feliks Janiewicz]], one of the co-organisers of the first [[Edinburgh Festival]]. The grave is marked by a tall grey granite obelisk. It lies in the overgrown area (2014) to the south-west, around 50m east of the more accessible monument to [[Horatio McCulloch]].

&lt;!--[[Image:Some aboriginal communities in the northern territory australia.jpg|thumb|Shows location of Gurindji (blue, near top left) in the [[Northern Territory]]]]--&gt;{{coord|17.38698|S|131.11641|E|region:AU-NT_type:city(350)|display=title}}
'''Wave Hill walk-off''' or '''The Gurindji strike''' was a walk-off and strike by 200 [[Gurindji people|Gurindji]] [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]], house [[servants]] and their families in August 1966 at [[Wave Hill Station|Wave Hill]] [[cattle station]] in [[Kalkarindji]] (formerly known as Wave Hill), [[Northern Territory]], Australia.

The Gurindji people's traditional lands are approximately 3,250&amp;nbsp;km² of the Northern Territory. Gurindji first encountered Europeans in the 1850s, when explorer [[Augustus Gregory]] crossed into their territory. Several other explorers traversed the area over the following decades until the early 1880s, when large pastoral operations were established.

==Gurindji and the pastoralists==
[[Wave Hill (Australia)|Wave Hill]] cattle station, which included the Kalkaringi and Daguragu area, was first stocked in 1883.

Gurindji – along with all Aboriginal groups in this predicament – found their [[billabong|waterhole]]s and [[soakage]]s fenced off or fouled by cattle, which also ate or trampled [[bushfood|fragile desert plant life]], such as [[bush tomato]]. [[Dingo]] hunters regularly shot the people's invaluable hunting dogs, and [[kangaroo]], a staple meat, was also routinely shot since it competed with cattle for water and grazing land. Gurindji suffered lethal "[[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|reprisals]]" for any attempt to eat the cattle – anything from a skirmish to a [[List of massacres of indigenous Australians|massacre]]. The last recorded massacre in the area occurred at [[Coniston massacre|Coniston]] in 1928. There was little choice to stay alive but to move onto the cattle stations, receive [[ration]]s, adopt a more [[sedentism|sedentary]] life and, where possible, take work as [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[domestic worker|domestic help]]. If they couldn't continue their traditional way of life, then at least to be on their own land –  the foundation for their religion and [[Dreaming (spirituality)|spiritual beliefs]] –  seemed crucial.

In 1914, Wave Hill Station was bought by [[Vestey Group|Vestey]]s, a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] pastoral company comprising a large conglomerate of cattle companies owned by [[Samuel Vestey, 3rd Baron Vestey|Baron Vestey]]. Pastoralists were able to make use of the now landless Aboriginal people as extremely cheap [[Manual labour|labour]]. On stations across the north, Aboriginal people became the backbone of the cattle industry, working for little or no money, minimal food and appalling housing.

==Conditions on the station==
There had been complaints from Indigenous employees about conditions over many years. A [[Northern Territory]] government inquiry held in the 1930s said of Vesteys:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was obvious that they had been ... quite ruthless in denying their Aboriginal labour proper access to basic human rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, little was done over the decades leading up to the strike. While it was illegal up until 1968 to pay Aboriginal workers more than a specified amount in goods and money, a 1945 inquiry found Vesteys was not even paying Aboriginal workers the 5 [[shilling]]s a day minimum wage set up for Aborigines under a 1918 [[law|Ordinance]]. Non-Indigenous males were receiving £2/8/- a week in 1945. Gurindji lived in [[corrugated iron]] [[humpy|humpies]] without floors, lighting, sanitation, furniture or cooking facilities. Billy Bunter Jampijinpa, who lived on Wave Hill Station at the time said

&lt;blockquote&gt;We were treated just like dogs. We were lucky to get paid the 50 quid a month we were due, and we lived in tin humpies you had to crawl in and out on your knees. There was no running water. The food was bad – just flour, tea, sugar and bits of beef like the head or feet of a bullock. The Vesteys mob were hard men. They didn't care about blackfellas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gurindji who received minimal [[social security|government benefits]] had these paid into pastoral company accounts over which they had no control. In contrast, non-Aboriginal workers enjoyed minimum wage security with no legal limit on the maximum they could be paid. They were housed in comfortable homes with gardens and had full control over their finances.

== The walk off ==
On 23 August 1966, led by spokesman [[Vincent Lingiari]], the workers and their families walked off Wave Hill and began their ten-year strike. Lingiari led [[Gurindji people|Gurindji]], as well as [[Ngarinman]], [[Bilinara]], [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] and [[Mudbara]] workers to an important sacred site nearby at Wattie Creek (Daguragu). Initially, the action was interpreted as purely a strike against work and living conditions. However, it soon became apparent that it was not just – or even primarily – improved conditions Gurindji were campaigning for. Their primary demand was for return of their land. Novelist [[Frank Hardy]] was one of the many non-Indigenous Australians who supported the Gurindji struggle through the strike years as was Darwin based trade unionist [[Brian Manning (Australian trade unionist and activist)|Brian Manning]].

"This bin [been] Gurindji country long time before them Vestey mob," Vincent Lingiari told Hardy at the time.

While Hardy records Pincher Manguari as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We want them Vestey mob all go away from here. Wave Hill Aboriginal people bin called Gurindji. We bin here long time before them Vestey mob. This is our country, all this bin Gurindji country. Wave Hill bin our country. We want this land; we strike for that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Gurindji strike was not the first or the only demand by Aborigines for the return of their lands – but it was the first one to attract wide public support within Australia for [[Native title|Land Rights]].

In 1968, 60 Aboriginal workers at another Vestey's property, [[Limbunya]], also joined the strike when they walked off the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article107064837 |title=Aborigines walk off jobs. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=Australian Capital Territory |date=27 July 1968 |accessdate=2 June 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1966–75 – The strike years==
The Gurindji established a settlement near by at Wattie Creek, which Gurindji have always called Daguragu. These were hard years, but they held strong to their belief in their right to the land.

===Gurindji efforts during the strike years===
[[File:Vincent Lingiari, 1968.jpg|thumb|"[[Vincent Lingiari|Vincent]], May 1968" (Vincent Lingiari); charcoal on paper, by [[Frank Hardy]], drawn while researching his book, ''[[The Unlucky Australians]]''.]]
While living at Daguragu, Gurindji drew up maps showing areas they wanted excised from pastoralist land and returned to them. In 1967, Gurindji petitioned the [[Governor-General]], claiming 1,295&amp;nbsp;km² of land near Wave Hill. Their claim was rejected. While Dagaragu would eventually become the first cattle [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]] to be owned and managed by an Aboriginal community, today known as the Murramulla Gurindji Company, it would be many years before the Gurindji achieved this.

In this period, [[Vincent Lingiari]], Billy Bunter Jampijinpa and others toured Australia, with the support of workers' [[trade union|union]]s, to give talks, raise awareness, build support for their cause and have meetings with major lawyers and politicians. [[Frank Hardy]] recalled one fundraising meeting at which a donor gave $500 after hearing Vincent Lingiari speak. The donor – who said he had never before met an Aboriginal person – was a young Dr [[Fred Hollows]], the eye surgeon and Communist activist.

===Attempts to entice and stymie Gurindji===
Billy Bunter Jampijinpa was 16 at the time of the walk-off:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Vesteys mob came and said they would get two killers (slaughtered beasts) and raise our wages if we came back. But old Vincent said, 'No, we're stopping here'. Then in early 1967 we walked to our new promised land, we call it Daguragu (Wattie Creek), back to our sacred places and our country, our new homeland.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In late 1966 the [[Northern Territory]] government offered a compromise pay rise of 125 per cent, but the strikers still demanded wages equal to those of white stockmen and return of their land. The Government also made moves to cut off means of Gurindji obtaining food supplies and threatened evictions. Offers of houses, which the Government had built for them at Wave Hill Welfare settlement, were resisted. The Gurindji persisted with their protest and stayed at Daguragu.

In 1969 the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|National Country]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government was given a proposal to give eight square kilometres back to the Gurindji. Cabinet refused even to discuss the issue.

===Support for the Gurindji grows===
However, the tide of public opinion was beginning to turn in Australia. There were demonstrations and arrests in southern Australia in support of the walk-off, and many [[National church|church]], student and trade union groups gave practical and fundraising support to the Gurindji struggle. Several significant events marked the change in opinion in Australia.

====1967 Referendum====
{{Main|Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)}}
An overwhelming majority of Australians – over 90 per cent of voters and a majority in all six states – voted "Yes" to giving the Federal Government power to make laws for Indigenous Australians.

====1972–75 Whitlam Labor Government====
[[File:Whitlam Lingiari Image 3.jpg|thumb|[[Gough Whitlam]] and [[Vincent Lingiari]]]]
In 1972 the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) came to power. Aboriginal land rights was an issue high on its agenda, and it was quick to set up an Inquiry, and subsequently draft legislation, to this end. The Labor Government called a halt to development leases granted by the Northern Territory Land Board that might damage Indigenous rights, suspended mining exploration licences, and gave a small grant of land at Daguragu/Wattie Creek, as an initial step towards the final land handback.

====1972 Woodward Royal Commission====
The [[Whitlam government]] established the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Commission|Royal Commission into Aboriginal Land Rights]] in the Northern Territory, headed by [[Philip Woodward (judge)|Justice Woodward]]. The Inquiry's task was to examine the legal establishment of land rights. The Commission recommended government financial support for the creation of reserves and incorporated land trusts, administered by traditional owners or land councils.

====1973–74 Gove land rights case====
{{Main|Gove land rights case}}
Meanwhile, the [[Yolngu]] of northeast [[Arnhem Land]] were taking their grievances to the courts, in the case of [[Gove land rights case|Milirrpum v Nabalco]], after unsuccessfully petitioning the Commonwealth government with a [[Yirrkala bark petitions|bark petition]]. The judge's decision in [[Gove land rights case|Gove]] had relied on the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' to deny the [[Yolngu]] rights to their land and ensure the security of a [[bauxite]] mine by Nabalco. Coupled with the ongoing Gurindji strike, this case highlighted the very real need for Aboriginal land rights in Australia.

====1976 Aboriginal Land Rights Act====
{{Main|Aboriginal Land Rights Act}}
As a result of the recommendations of the Woodward Inquiry, the Whitlam government drafted the Aboriginal Land Rights Bill. The legislation was not passed by [[Australian Parliament|parliament]] prior to [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|the Whitlam government's dismissal]] in 1975. The subsequent [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government passed effectively similar legislation – the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act]] – on 9 December 1976.

==1975 – Handback==
In 1975, the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of [[Gough Whitlam]] finally negotiated with Vesteys to give the Gurindji back a portion of their land. This was a landmark in the [[Native title|land rights]] movement in Australia for [[Indigenous Australians]]. The handback took place on 16 August 1975 at Kalkaringi. Gough Whitlam addressed Vincent Lingiari and the Gurindji people, saying:

{{quote|On this great day, I, Prime Minister of Australia, speak to you on behalf of all Australian people – all those who honour and love this land we live in. For them I want to say to you: I want this to acknowledge that we Australians have still much to do to redress the injustice and oppression that has for so long been the lot of Black Australians.

Vincent Lingiari, I solemnly hand to you these deeds as proof, in Australian law, that these lands belong to the Gurindji people and I put into your hands part of the earth itself as a sign that this land will be the possession of you and your children forever.}}

[[Mervyn Bishop]]'s photograph of Whitlam pouring sand into Lingiari's hand on that day, has become an iconic one in Australian history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=2554 Prime Minister Gough Whitlam pours soil into hand of traditional landowner Vincent Lingiari, Northern Territory 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy of the strike==
[[Vincent Lingiari]] confronted the vast economic and political forces arrayed against him and his people. The walk-off and strike were landmark events in the struggle for Aboriginal [[Native title|land rights]] in Australia. For the first time recognition was given of Indigenous people, their rights and responsibilities for the land, and their ability to practise their law, language and culture. In August every year, a large celebration is held at Kalkaringi to mark the anniversary of the strike and walk-off. Known as Freedom Day, people gather from many parts of Australia to celebrate and re-enact the walk-off.

In 2006 an [[Australian Senate]] report looked into the matter of underpayment of indigenous workers in the past. A group of those involved in the Wave Hill walk-off have said that they would be prepared to make a reparation claim for underpaid and stolen wages as a test case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url= http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2006-12-08/wave-hill-group-prepares-stolen-wages-claim/2149264| title=Wave Hill group prepares stolen wages claim  | publisher= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]  | date= 8 December 2006  | accessdate= 9 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The walk-off route has been entered on the [[Australian National Heritage List]].

[[Ted Egan]] wrote the "Gurindji Blues" in the 1960s with [[Vincent Lingiari]]. The words to the first verse are:

{{poemquote|Poor Bugger Me, Gurindji
Me bin sit down this country
Long before no Lord Vesty
All about land belong to we}}

In 1971 the song was recorded by [[Galarrwuy Yunupingu]], a [[Yolngu]] man actively involved in land rights for his own people through the [[Yirrkala bark petitions|bark petition]] and [[Gove land rights case]]. Ted Egan says he was moved to write "Gurindji Blues" after he heard [[Peter Nixon]], then Minister for the Interior, say in parliament that if the Gurindji wanted land, they should save up and buy it, like any other Australian. In 1991, [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] and [[Kev Carmody]] recorded "[[From Little Things Big Things Grow]]". The words to the first verse are:

{{poemquote|Gather round people let me tell you a story
An eight year-long story of power and pride
British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiari
Were opposite men on opposite sides}}

The words to the last verse are:

{{poemquote|That was the story of Vincent Lingiari
But this is the story of something much more
How power and privilege can not move a people
Who know where they stand and stand in the law.}}

Irish folk musician [[Damien Dempsey]]'s song "Wave Hill Walk Off" commemorates the Gurindji strike and the struggle for Aboriginal land rights.

The words to the first verse are:

{{poemquote|In the year of Lord Jesus nineteen and sixty six,
A great rumbling sound came from up in the sticks,
All these gentle black warriors they dreamed of a Bill,
And enough was enough, so they walked off Wave Hill.}}

The words to the last verse are:

{{poemquote|For nine hungry years they kept up their bold stand,
And took off with and poured land into Vincent's hand
For indigenous land rights it was finally time,
For to make reparations for a giant of a crime.}}

A '''weavers' cottage''' was (and to an extent is) a type of house used by [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] for [[cloth production]] in the [[putting-out system]] sometimes known as the domestic system.

Weavers' cottages were common in Great Britain, often with dwelling quarters on the lower floors and [[loom]]-shop on the top floor. Cellar loomshops on the ground floor or in the basement were found where [[cotton]] was woven, as they provided high humidity. A loom-shop can be often recognised by a long row of windows which provided maximum light for the weaver.

==Cottage industry==
[[Medieval]] period peasants' cottages have rarely survived, while the prestigious dwellings of merchants and traders are still in evidence. The urban poor manufactured items in the living area of their cottages. The rural poor, bound to the land owner, worked in one of their master's buildings. With the rise of a non-agrarian society, subsistence level domestic manufacture became common, and the introduction of machinery required either the living room to be enlarged and modified or the addition of a separate room.{{sfn|Brunskill|2000|p=180}} Requirements were similar for any domestic manufacturing craft industry.

In a rural home the living room was enlarged so the weaver could benefit from heat from the single hearth. To provide enough light to operate a loom, a long window of up to ten lights occupied one wall. Alternatively, an extra storey was added so that manufacture was separated from family life. The loom shop was marked by the long multi-light [[mullioned window]] that became common in urban settings.{{sfn|Brunskill|2000|p=180}} Three-storey terraced cottages are now referred to as Weavers' cottages.{{sfn|Brunskill|2000|p=180}}

Most extant cottages in the north-west date from the late-18th and early-19th century when weaving had ceased to be a sideline. They were adapted or built specially at a time when spinning technology was sufficiently advanced to supply the needs of the weavers. Wool and silk manufacture were slower to adopt power driven looms than the cotton industry.{{sfn|Ashmore|1969|p=28|ps=}} Terraces of three-storey brick-built domestic workshops were built in [[Macclesfield]] after silk weaving was introduced around 1790 and more than 600 weavers had looms in their homes in 1825.{{sfn|Ashmore|1982|p=44|ps=}} Domestic workshops for velvet cutting survived in the [[Cadishead]] area until 1914.{{sfn|Ashmore|1969|p=34|ps=}}

==Loomshop==
[[File:Weavers' cottages Maccclesfield.svg|thumb|A terrace of three storey silk weavers cottages]]
To be an efficient manufacturing facility, a loomshop needed good daylight, controlled ventilation, un-obstructed space, provision for storage, heat, and access for goods and workers. Hand looms were manual, the artisan raised the [[heddle]]s using foot levers, and threw the [[shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] the width of the loom by hand, forward and back. The left hand was used to operate the batten that compressed the pick. Broader cloth could not be woven this way, so the weaver used a child to throw back the shuttle. [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]]'s [[flying shuttle]] of 1733, removed the need for the child. The weaver jerked the two hammers or pickers with a picking stick held in the right hand. The pickers propelled the shuttle, and the left hand operated the batten.{{sfn|Aspin|1981|p=19}}

A loom shop would either be built as an attached shed entered from outside or as a garret above the house entered through a trap-door from below or by external stairs to minimize disruption when a new beam was brought in. Animal fibres ([[wool]], [[silk]]) did not need [[sizing]] so considerations of [[humidity]] were unimportant. It was usual for a loomshop to contain three or four looms which were worked by members of the family. In the house below was a kitchen and scullery and living room on the ground floor and two bedrooms on the first, a typical two-up-two-down cottage. Sometimes a row of cottages would have a common loom-shop above, allowing several looms to be worked.

It was believed that artisan weavers wove cloth during poor weather and worked on their land when possible. It is more likely that some weavers worked full-time at the loom, breaking off to help their neighbours during the harvest. Some smallholders were weavers to supplement their main income.{{sfn|Timmins|1993|pp=72-78}} Full-time weavers tended to cluster in rows of cottages forming a hamlet while the smallholders cottage was likely to be solitary.{{sfn|Timmins|1993|p=78}}

The man of the house was the most productive and worked full-time, his wife shared her time between the loom and childcare. Unmarried children were employed and trained on the job.{{sfn|Timmins|1993|p=75}}

==Lancashire cellar loomshops==
By the end of the 17th century three localised areas of textile production could be identified in Lancashire. [[Linen]] was woven in the west of the county and in Manchester while in upland Pennine regions, woollens were woven and in central Lancashire the emphasis was on [[fustian]]s, cloth made with a linen warp and wool weft. In central Lancashire weavers subsequently switched to [[calico (textile)|calico]], cloth with a cotton warp and a cotton weft. In the 1790s, the demand for calico expanded and more towns switched to cotton weaving producing cloth for the emerging printing industry.{{sfn|Timmins|1993|pp=78-79}}

Weaving cotton requires humid conditions and cotton needed to be [[Sizing|sized]], strands of warp thread were coated with a layer of paste to prevent chafing against the [[Heddle|heald]]s and [[Reed (weaving)|reed]]s in the batten.{{sfn|Timmins|1977|p=21}} If the size hardened it broke the thread. Loomshops were built in the basement or on the ground floor. The weavers kept the floor beneath the loom moist, sometimes by digging channels into the clay floor and pouring in water.{{sfn|Timmins|1977|p=21}} The loomshop was entered through the family accommodation so humidity was not lost to the outside. In such a cottage, one ground floor room became the manufactory, and the family lived in the other, a kitchen living room.{{sfn|Timmins|1996|pp=20,21}} Sometimes a basement was excavated beneath the family home lit by elongated windows. The term 'cellar loomshop' was used for both ground floor and basement establishments.{{efn|In the 19th century ''cellar'' had a broader meaning than today, and did not just mean basement. cf wine-cellar}}

In the peak years of handloom weaving around 1820, there were 170,000 handloom weavers in Lancashire.{{sfn|Timmins|1993|p=185}} The 1851 census recorded 55,000 hand loom weavers in the county while the 1861 census records 30,000 and the 1871 census 10,000. By 1891, few were left. The figures give some indication of number of weavers cottages that existed. It is probable that there would be four looms in each shop.{{sfn|Timmins|1996|pp=54,55}} {{efn|Timmins {{sfn|Timmins|1993|p=185}}cautions an relying on the census data as the accuracy of the enumerators was variable, some failed to differentiate between the power loom weaver and the hand weaver.}}

==Legacy==
At the time of rapid [[urbanisation]], rows of [[terraced house]]s were constructed to accommodate the new urban workers. In East Anglia detached cottages were built from timber and [[Cob (material)|cob]], while woollen weaving communities favoured three-storey two-up two-down with a loom shop above.{{sfn|Brunskill|2000|p=184}}

The loomshop design was adequate until power was needed and in a sense the early [[weaving shed]]s were extended loom shops.

[[File:Vincent van Gogh 0141.jpg|thumb|A weavers cottage, as seen by [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Nuenen]] 1884]]

In 1884, [[Vincent van Gogh]] made a [[Peasant Character Studies (Van Gogh series)|series of drawings and paintings]] of rural artisan weavers and the loomshops in their cottages. Van Gogh was interested in the "meditative appearance" of the weavers.&lt;ref name=VGMSeries&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=5539&amp;collection=1294&amp;lang=en |title=Series of weavers |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "A weaver who has to direct and to interweave a great many little threads has no time to philosophize about it, but rather he is so absorbed in his work that he doesn't think but acts, and he feels how things must go more than he can explain it." he wrote in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/12/274.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written 11 March 1883 in The Hague.  |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits |accessdate=2011-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By then rural weaving was not a prosperous trade; income varied dramatically depending upon crop yields for material and market conditions.  Weavers were living a poor life, especially in comparison to urban centers of textile manufacturing nearby such as [[Leiden]].  The rural artisan's livelihood had become increasingly precarious.&lt;ref name=Zemel61&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Progress: Utopia, Modernity, and Late-Nineteenth-Century Art | author=Zemel, C | publisher=University of California Press | location=Berkeley | year=1997 | pages=61–62 | isbn=0-520-08849-2  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2gWfmFn0_QC&amp;pg=PA56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh wrote to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], "Their life is hard. A weaver who stays hard at work makes a piece of about 60 yards a week. While he weaves, his wife has to sit before him, winding – in other words, winding the spools of yarn – so there are two of them who work and have to make a living from it."&lt;ref name=VGM36&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=1480&amp;collection=619 |title=Woman Winding Yarn, 1885  |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yugra''' or '''Iuhra''' ([[Old Russian]] Югра ''Jugra''; [[Byzantine Greek]] [[Οὔγγροι]] ''Oὔggroi'') was a collective name for lands and peoples between the [[Pechora River]] and [[Urals]] (modern north-west Russia), in the [[Russia]]n annals of the 12th&amp;ndash;17th Centuries. During this period the region was inhabited  by the name of the [[Khanty people|Khanty]] (a.k.a. Ostyaks; ''Hanty'') and [[Mansi people|Mansi]] (Vogul; ''Maansi'') peoples. Yugra was also the source for the name of the [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] language family (including both the ''[[Khanty language|Hantĩ]]'' and ''[[Mansi language|Mān'si]]'' languages).

The modern [[Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug]] is also sometimes known as Yugra.

==History==
[[File:Herberstein-Moscovia-NE.png|thumb|Yugra (''Iuhra''), "the place of origin of [[Hungarians]]" (''inde ungaroru origo'') on [[Sigismund von Herberstein]]'s 1549 map of [[Moscovia]]. Herberstein placed the label ''Iuhra'' east of the [[Ob River]], while a statue of ''Aurea anus'' ({{lang-la|"Golden Old Woman"}}), a.k.a. ''Slata [[Kurgan stelae|baba]]'' ("Golden Idol") can be seen west of the Ob.]]

The 12th century missionary and traveller [[Al-Gharnati|Abu Hamid al-Gharnati]] gives one of the earliest accounts of the region, which he calls ''Yura'' in Arabic:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But beyond [[Wisu]] by the [[White Sea|Sea of Darkness]] there lies a land known by the name of ''Yura''. In summers the days are very long there, so that the Sun does not set for forty days, as the merchants say; but in winters the nights are equally long. The merchants report that Darkness is not far (from them), and that the people of Yura go there and enter it with torches, and find a huge tree there which is like a big village. But on top of the tree there sits a large creature, they say it is a bird. And they bring merchandise along, and each merchant sets down his goods apart from those of the others; and he makes a mark on them and leaves, but when he comes back, he finds commodities there, necessary for his own country…" (Al Garnati:32)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Golden Lady of the Obians]] was apparently an idol of the Yugrans. The first reports of the Golden Lady are found in the 14th-century [[Novgorod Chronicles]], with reference to [[Saint Stephan of Perm]]. Next, the golden idol is mentioned in the 16th century by the subjects of the Grand Duke of Moscow, commissioned to describe the trade and military routes of the expanding Russia. The first non-Russian we know of to comment on the golden lady is [[Maciej Miechowita]], Professor of [[Cracow University]]. The golden idol appeared on [[Sigismund von Herberstein]]'s map of Moscovia published in 1549, and on a number of later maps, e.g. [[Gerhard Mercator]]'s "[[:File:Mercator Septentrionalium Terrarum descriptio.jpg|Map of the Arctic]] (1595)", where it is labeled ''Zolotaia Baba'' (from Russian [[:ru:Золотая баба|Золотая баба]] - "Golden Lady" or "Golden [[balbal|Idol]]").

In connection with [[Yermak]]'s campaign, the ''[[Siberian Chronicle]]'' also tells us about the golden woman: a hetman of Yermak's, by the name of Ivan Bryazga, invaded the [[Belogorye region]] in 1582 and fought the Ob-Ugrians there, who were defending their holiest object - the golden woman. (See Karjalainen 1918:243-245, Shestalov 1987:347.) And [[Grigori Novitski]]'s statement that in earlier days there used to be in one shrine in Belogorye together with the ''copper goose'' "the greatest real idol", and that the superstitious people "preserved that idol and took it to Konda now that idol-worshipping is being rooted up", has also been regarded as relating to the golden woman (Novitski:61). Actually, no European has ever seen that idol and most probably it never existed in the described form (as a full-length woman made of gold).

Of the "Copper Goose" Novitski wrote the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The goose idol very much worshipped by them is cast of copper in the shape of a goose, its atrocious abode is in the Belogorye village on the great river of Ob. According to their superstition they worship the god of waterfowls - swans, geese and other birds swimming on water… His throne in the temple is made of different kinds of broadcloth, canvas and hide, built like a nest; in it sits the monster who is always highly revered, most of all at the times of catching waterfowls in nests… This idol is so notorious that people come from distant villages to perform atrocious sacrifice to it - offering cattle, mainly horses; and they are certain that it (the idol) is the bearer of many goods, mainly ensuring the richness of waterfowls…" &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Comparisons of different Yugran traditions indicate that the goose was one of the shapes or appearances of the most popular god of the "World Surveyor Man", and that [[Belogorye]] is still sometimes referred to as his home. Novitsky also describes a site for worshipping this "World Surveyor" or "Ob Master":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The home of the Ob Master was presumably near the stronghold Samarovo in the mouth of the river Irtysh. According to their heathen belief he was the god of the fish, depicted in a most impudent manner: a board of wood, nose like a tin tube, eyes of glass, little horns on top of the head, covered with rags, attired in a (gilt breasted) purple robe. Arms - bows, arrows, spears, armour, etc - were laid beside him. According to their heathen belief they say about the collected arms that he often has to fight in the water and conquer other vassals. The frenzy ones thought that the atrocious monster is especially horrifying in the darkness and in the large waters, that he comes through all the depths where he watches over all fish and aquatic animals and gives everyone as much as he pleases." (Novitsky: 59).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern history==
The Christianization of the Mansi en masse started at the beginning of the 18th century.  Novitsky{{Clarify|date=July 2013}} describes the Christianization of the Pelym Mansi in 1714 and the Konda Mansi in 1715. The words of the village elder and the caretaker of the sanctuary '''Nahratch Yeplayev''' have been recorded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We all know why you have come here -- you want to pervert us from our ancient beliefs with your smooth-tongued flattery and damage and destroy our revered helper, but it is all in vain for you may take our heads but this we will not let you do." (Novitsky: 92-93)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Novitsky describes the above-mentioned idol as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The idol was carved of wood, attired in green clothes, the evil looking face was covered with white iron, a black fox skin was placed on its head; the whole sanctuary, especially his site which was higher than anywhere else, was decorated with purple broadcloth. Other smaller idols nearby which were placed lower were called the servants of the real idol. I think there were many other things in front of him - caftans, squirrel skins, etc…" (Ibid.: 93)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It seems that a compromise was reached whereby the idols would be saved - for now at least - and at last Nahratsh who had consulted the elders of the village proposed a compromise:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "We will now obey the ruler's regulations and ukase. So we will not discard your teaching, we only beg you not to reject the idol so revered by our fathers and grandfathers, and if you wish to christen us, honour also our idol, christen it in a more honourable manner - with a golden cross. Then we will decorate and build a church with all the icons ourselves, as a custom goes, and we will place ours also among these." (Ibid.: 94-95) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This arrangement seems to have lasted for a while, but later it is recorded that this agreement was broken and the totems and idols so sacred to the Mansi and Khanty were burned by Russian Christian zealots. Many of these totems were not destroyed, but were hidden, their locations kept secret over the generations. Even during repression in the 1930s many of these sacred sites remained undiscovered by the authorities and some can be found today.

==Yugrian Principalities and relations with the Tatars and the Russians==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Kondia.jpeg|thumbnail|right|The Coat of Arms of Kondia.]]
There are three or four known proto-states of the Yugran inhabitants, both [[Khanty people|Khanty]] and [[Mansi people|Mansi]]. The [[Principality of Pelym]] (largely Khanty) was located in the basin of the Konda river and stretched from the mouth of the [[Sosva River (Sverdlovsk Oblast)|Sosva River]] near [[Tavda]] up to [[Tabory (Russia)|Tabory]]. The stronghold of the Pelym princes was also a significant religious centre; a sacred Siberian larch grew in its surroundings and even in the 18th century people used to hang the skins of sacrificed horses on its branches. Near the sacred tree was a worship storehouse with five idols of human figure, and smaller storehouses with high pillars and human-faced peaks around it for storing sacrificial instruments. The bones of sacrificial animals were stored in a separate building (Novitski: 81). The Principality of [[Kondia|Konda]] (mainly Mansi) formed a large semi autonomous part of the Pelym principality, according to the tax registers from 1628/29 it was inhabited by 257 tax-paying Mansi. The treasures of Prince ''Agai of Konda'' who was imprisoned by the Russians in 1594 gives us a good picture of the wealth of the Yugran nobles of this period. Namely, the Russians confiscated two silver crowns, a silver spoon, a silver beaker, a silver spiral bracelet, "precious drapery" and numerous pelts and precious furs (Bahrushin 1955,2: 146). The third part of the Pelym principality was the region of Tabary, in which inhabited 102 adults in 1628/29. Preceding the coming of the Russians the Mansi of this region were farmers and according to the tradition Yermak collected tribute in the form of grain (Bahrushin 1955,2: 147).

It is believed that the Yugran people or [[Ob-Ugrians]] had made trade with many countries far and wide since the earliest times. This trade was described in journals attributed to [[Abu Hamid al-Gharnati]] the [[Arab]] traveller during the 12th century:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "And from [[Bolghar]] merchants travel to the land of {{linktext|heathen}}s, called [[Wisu]]; marvellous [[beaver]] skins come from there, and they take there wedge-shaped unpolished swords made in [[Azerbaijan]] in their turn… But the inhabitants of Visu take these swords to the land that lies near the Darkness [Yugra] by the Black Sea [now known as the [[White Sea]]], and they trade the swords for sable skins. And these people take the swords and cast them into the Black Sea; but [[Allah]] the Almighty sends them a fish which size is like a mountain [a whale]; and they sail out to the fish in their ships and carve its flesh for months on end." (ibid:58-59)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to some sources, Novgorod launched military campaigns against the Yugrans "living with the [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyeds]] in the Land of Midnight" already at the end of the [[first millennium]] (Bahrushin 1955,1:86). At that time, the Russians probably came into contact with the [[Mansi people|Mansi]] who were still living in Europe, along the upper course of the river [[Pechora]], in the neighbourhood of the ancient [[Komi peoples|Komi]] realm of [[Great Perm]]. The [[Novgorod Chronicle]] tells of a military campaign under the leadership of ''Yadrei of Novgorod'' in 1193, which ended in the destruction of the Novgorod forces. The defeat was blamed on some Novgorodans who had reportedly "been in contact with the Yugrans" (Bahrushin 1955,1:75). In the 13th to 15th centuries, Yugra was supposed to pay tribute to Novgorod. But taxes could be collected only by means of armed forces. The chronicles describe several campaigns, mentioning the strong resistance of Yugran princes who took shelter in their strongholds. After the annexation of [[Ustyug]] by [[Moscow]] in the 14th century, Muscovite campaigns began instead of the Novgorodan ones.

In the 15th century, the most important Russian stronghold in Permland and the starting point for all expeditions going to the East was the diocese established on the [[Vym River]] by Stephan of Perm. In 1455 the [[Mansi people|Mansi]] of [[Pelym]] launched a campaign under the command of ''Prince Asyka''. Moscow reciprocated by forming an alliance with Prince [[Vasily of Great Perm]] who together with the warriors of Vym who took part in the 1465 expedition to Yugra (Bahrushin 1955,1:76). It is recorded in the [[Russian Chronicles]] that in 1465 as a result of this raid that two minor "Yugrian" princes named ''Kalpik'' and ''Chepik'' were compelled to submit to the Russians and pay [[tribute]]. They were soon deposed. In a second campaign during 1467 Prince Asyka himself was captured and brought to [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]] (Bahrushin 1955,2:113). In 1483 Moscow sent forth another expedition against the princes of Yugra and [[Kondia|Konda]] where the "grand duke" [[Moldan]] was captured (Ibid). In 1499 Moscow dispatched a great force against "Yugra" (Pelym) (led by Prince ''Semyon Kurbski''), Konda or ''Koda'' (led by Prince ''Pyotr Ushatyi'' and the "Gogulichi" (the free Voguls or Mansi), The 4000 strong army, using dog and reindeer teams, reached the [[Lyapin]] stronghold of the [[Khanty people|Khanty]], located on the river of the same name (Bahrushin 1955,1:76-77). In the source it is told that 40 strongholds were taken and 58 Khanty and Mansi princes captured in the expedition. Even though already at the end of the 15th century the Grand Duke of Moscow assumed the honorary title of ''Prince of Yugra'' by the 16th century several Yugran princes were paying tribute to the [[Siberia Khanate]] and participated in their military ventures against Russian settlers protected by [[Cossacks]] and Komi auxiliaries who were chasing the Yugran natives from their homes.

In response the Khanty and Mansi of [[Pelym]] continually sent forth counter-campaigns to the lands of [[Great Perm]]. Thus, the year 1581 went into history as the year of the raiding of [[Kaigorod]] and [[Cherdyn, Perm Krai|Cherdyn]]. According to Russian estimates, the army of the Mansi and their allies, the Tartars, stood 700 strong (Bahrushin 1955,1:99; 2:144). Continuing resistance to border conflagration led to the launching of a campaign in 1582–1584 arranged and financed by the [[Stroganovs]] and led by the Cossack leader [[Yermak Timofeyevich]], which began with the destruction of a Mansi war band that had invaded the Russian settlers territory and ended as a [[punitive expedition]] against the [[Pelym]] Mansi and their ally the Siberian Khan. In some sources, ''Alach, Prince of [[Kondia|Koda]]'' figures as an important ally of the Siberian Khan [[Kuchum|Kuchum Khan]] and is said to have been awarded one of the [[Yermak]] mail-coats taken from the enemy (Bahrushin 1955, 1:114). In 1592, another Russian campaign against the Mansi of Pelym was launched. It ended in 1593 when the stronghold of Prince [[Ablegirim of Pelym]] was taken, the prince and his family captured and a Russian fortress erected in the heart of the stronghold. Although in the following year the Pelym principality suffered the loss of its lands lying on the [[Konda River]], the Mansi did not give up resistance. In 1599, they once again brought "war, theft and treachery" to the banks of the [[Chusovaya River]] and [[Kurya River]] and plundered the Russian settlements there (Bahrushin,2:143-144).

The close connections between the Yugrans and the Turkic Tartars are also demonstrated by the fact that even in the 1660s, the idea of restoring the Kuchum Khanate was still popular with the Khanty of [[Beryozovo]] (Ibid). It was only in the middle of the 17th century that Moscow succeeded in subduing Yugra.

In the 18th century the successors of the Principality of Pelym and [[Kondia|Principality of Konda]] - princes Vassili and Fyodor - lived in Pelym. They became Russianized and performed various duties for the Tsarist government. The Mansi, however, considered them still as their rulers. The fact that the ancient family of princes ruled on in Konda is also proved by a tsar letter from 1624:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "He, prince Vassili and prince Fyodor have close brothers in Big Konda - our tax-paying murzas, and our simple Voguls are ruled by them in Big Konda, the brothers of prince Vasily, the murzas." (Bahrushin 1955,2: 148) &lt;/blockquote&gt; Prince ''Kyntsha of Konda'' received a deed of gift from Tsar in 1680 which confirmed his noble position. Even in the 18th century the Konda princes were known for their relative independence. It is assumed that even in 1715 Prince ''Satyga of Konda'' and his 600 armed men made an attempt to impede the [[christianisation]] of the Konda Mansi (Novitski: 98). During 1732–1747 Konda was ruled by Satyga's son Prince ''Osip Grigoryev'', followed by his own son Prince ''Vlas Ossipov''. According to recent research by Aado Lintrop one of the great-grandchildren of Satyga, the teacher of the Turinsky community school, ''Aleksander Satygin'' claimed the title "Prince of Konda" as late as 1842.

Yugra is also considered to be the place of origin of the [[Hungarians]] (in Hungarian ''[[magyar őshaza]]''). It is thought{{Who|date=November 2009}} that the name ''[[Hungary]]'' is a variety of the name Yugra{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} (The Hungarians also were known in several languages under the name of ''Ugri'', and are still known under this name in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]). ''Hungary'' is also said to derive from [[Onogurs|On-Ogur]], meaning ''Ten Ugors'' or ''Hun Ugors''. The word Ugor itself may be of Turkic origin meaning "tribe". The [[Hungarian language]] is also the closest linguistic relative of [[Khanty language|Khanty]] and [[Mansi language|Mansi]]. It is considered that Hungarians moved from Yugra to the west, first settling on the western side of the [[Urals]], in the region known as ''[[Magna Hungaria]]'' (Great Yugria). Then they moved further to the west, to the region of ''[[Levédia]]'' (present-day east [[Ukraine]]), then to the region of ''[[Etelköz]]'' (present-day west Ukraine), finally reaching the [[Carpathian Basin]] in the 9th century.
