Bush]] stated that the next meeting of the G20 would be important in finding solutions to the [[economic crisis of 2008|economic crisis]].
Since many economists and politicians called for a new [[Bretton Woods system]] (a monetary management which was instituted after World War II) to overhaul the world's financial structure, the meeting has sometimes been described by the media as ''Bretton Woods II''.&lt;ref name=Eurodad /&gt;

==Preliminary history==
===Approaches in the early 2000s===
''Bretton Woods II'' was an informal designation for the system of currency relations which developed during the 2000s (decade). As described by political economist [[Daniel Drezner]], "Under this system, the U.S. is running massive current account deficits to be the source of export-led growth for other countries. To fund this deficit, central banks, particularly those on the Pacific Rim, are buying up dollars and dollar-denominated assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=3 July 2008 
 |deadurl=no 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of a "revived Bretton Woods system" was introduced in a 2004 paper by Dooley, Folkerts-Landau, and Garber, in which it is described as arising after the end of the Cold War, out of the choice of countries, {{quote|mainly in Asia, [which] chose the same periphery strategy as immediate post-war Europe and Japan, undervaluing the exchange rate, managing sizable foreign exchange interventions, imposing controls, accumulating reserves, and encouraging export-led growth by sending goods to the competitive center countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael P. |last=Dooley |first2=David |last2=Folkerts‐Landau |first3=Peter |last3=Garber |title=The Revived Bretton Woods System |journal=International Journal of Finance and Economics |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=307–313 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/ijfe.250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2005, [[Nouriel Roubini|Roubini]] and [[Brad Setser|Setser]] argued that the system is unsustainable:
{{quote|If the US does not take policy steps to reduce its need for external financing before it exhausts the world's central banks willingness to keep adding to their dollar reserves – and if the rest of the world does not take steps to reduce its dependence on an unsustainable expansion in US domestic demand to support its own growth – the risk of a hard landing for the US and global economy will grow. The basic outlines of a hard landing are easy to envision: a sharp fall in the value of the US dollar, a rapid increase in US long-term interest rates and a sharp fall in the price of a range of risk assets including equities and housing. The asset price adjustment would lead to a severe slowdown in the US, and the fall in US imports associated with the US slowdown and the dollar's fall would lead to a global severe economic slowdown, if not an outright recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Financial crisis of 2007–===
On September 26, 2008, [[Nicolas Sarkozy|French President Nicolas Sarkozy]], said, "We must rethink the financial system from scratch, as at Bretton Woods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On October 13, 2008, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said world leaders must meet to agree to a new economic system. "We must have a new Bretton Woods, building a new international financial architecture for the years ahead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Cumbre G-20-Washington.jpg|300px|thumb|G20 leaders and delegates attend the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy Saturday at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. on November 15, 2008.]]

The formula is "G7 plus". In announcing the summit, US President George Bush said that the summit would bring together members of the [[G20]]. The G20 was set up to respond to the financial turmoil of 1997-99 through the development of policies that "promote international financial stability". The G20 comprises countries considered to be systemically important, but omits over 170 governments (192 governments are members of the United Nations).

The first meeting of the G20 leaders on financial markets and the world economy was held in Washington, D.C. on November 14–15, 2008, at the [[National Building Museum]]. The participants were: [[Argentina]], Australia, [[Brazil]], Canada, the [[People's Republic of China]], France, Germany, India, [[Indonesia]], Italy, Japan, Mexico, [[Republic of Korea]], Russia, [[Saudi Arabia]], South Africa, [[Turkey]], the United Kingdom, the [[United States of America]], the [[European Union]] (represented by France's President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as [[President of the European Council]], as well as by [[José Manuel Barroso]], president of the [[European Commission]]), the Netherlands (allowed extraordinary presence), Spain (allowed extraordinary presence), the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[Financial Stability Forum]]. Although Dutch Prime Minister [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] arrived at Andrews Air Force Base on the evening of November 14, he immediately returned to the Netherlands when notified of the death of his father; the Netherlands was instead represented by [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|State Secretary]] [[Jan Kees de Jager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081114-5.html|title=Delegations to the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy|publisher=[[White House]]|date=2008-11-14|accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] was not initially invited, but was "so desperate to secure an invitation" to the summit, that he traveled "to Asia to seek the help of President [[Hu Jintao]] of China."&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mallet, ''The Party Spain is Desperate to Crash'', Financial Times, Nov. 1, 2008.  [http://www.amchamspain.com/spanish/images/press/financialTimes1_11_08.pdf] {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zapatero eventually extracted an invitation through "intense lobbying" of French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], who happened to hold two invitations (the second French invitation was due to the fact that France held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] during this period).&lt;ref&gt;Diana Fong, ''Spain's Zapatero Takes Extra Seat at G20 Summit'', Deutsche Welle, Nov. 15, 2008.

===Suggestions===
German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said "Bretton Woods II" should bring about "genuine, all-encompassing reform of the international financial system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=132&amp;item=3008 |title=Breton Woods II conference FAQs |publisher=[[Eurodad]] |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2008-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114074955/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=132&amp;item=3008 |archivedate=2009-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of the European Union sees the meeting as "tak[ing] early decisions on transparency, global standards of regulation, cross-border supervision and crisis management, to avoid conflicts of interest and to create an early warning system, so as to engender confidence among savers and investors in every country." In announcing the meeting, the spokesperson for US President George Bush said that "leaders will review progress being made to address the current financial crisis, advance a common understanding of its causes, and, in order to avoid a repetition, agree on a common set of principles for reform of the regulatory and institutional regimes for the world's financial sector". UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in a mid-October speech, set out several principles. These include transparency (internationally agreed accounting standards, credit insurance market standards), integrity (credit agencies, executive pay), responsibility (board member competency and expertise), sound banking practice (protecting against speculative bubbles). While addressing the G20 leaders, [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]] listed four priorities in reforming the international financial system: stepping up international cooperation in [[financial regulation]]; advancing reform of international financial institutions; encouraging regional financial cooperation; and improving the international currency system.&lt;ref name="China Daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-11/16/content_7208365.htm |title=Washington summit targets at crisis |work=[[China Daily]] |date=2008-11-16 |accessdate=2008-11-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ih3i4Vgl?url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-11/16/content_7208365.htm |archivedate=2009-08-01 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the agreement was "comprehensive, positive and balanced".&lt;ref name="Xinhua News Agency"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/16/content_10365670.htm |title=Chinese FM: G20 summit "significant" for world to tackle financial crisis |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |date=2008-11-16 |accessdate=2008-11-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ih3lgdZZ?url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/16/content_10365670.htm |archivedate=2009-08-01 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this summit, [[Japan]]'s Prime Minister, [[Taro Aso]], had contributed feasible action plan based on the analysis of the surplus of Japan's international balance of payments in spite of her prolonged economic slump to [[Wall Street Journal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122660683367025399 |title=Restoring Financial Stability; Use Japan's experience as a guide to near-term problems ? then think bigger. |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2008-11-14 |first=Taro |last=Aso |accessdate=8 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010024302/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122660683367025399.html |archivedate=10 October 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also provided his idea includes funding in the meeting.

===Key achievements===
The [[White House]] reported that the summit had reached what would be the '''Washington declaration'''. The five key objectives the leaders agreed upon were:
* reached a common understanding of the root causes of the global crisis;
* reviewed actions countries had taken and would take in the future to address the immediate crisis and strengthen growth;
* agreed on common principles for reforming their financial markets;
* launched an action plan to implement those principles and asked ministers to develop further specific recommendations that would be reviewed by leaders at a subsequent summit; and
* reaffirmed their commitment to free market principles.&lt;ref name="Factsheet"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081115-4.html|title=Fact Sheet: Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy |publisher=[[White House]]|date=2008-11-14|accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary of the meeting's other salient points is presented by the [[White House]] in the "Fact Sheet"&lt;ref name=Factsheet /&gt; while the full conclusions are given in the Summit Declaration.&lt;ref name="Declaration"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081115-1.html|title=Declaration of the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy|publisher=[[White House]]|date=2008-11-15|accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the optimism expressed by many of those present, doubts soon began to emerge about the success of the meeting and the chances of achieving all its objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euronews.net/en/article/16/11/2008/doubts-surface-over-g-20-rescue-plan/|title=Doubts surface over G-20 rescue plan|publisher=[[Euronews]]|date=2008-11-16|accessdate=2008-11-16}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anna-Liisa Hirviluoto''' ( February 16, 1929 Helsinki - April 23, 2000 ) was a Finnish archaeologist. She made her career in the [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]] and its predecessor, the Archaeological Commission positions for 35 years.&lt;ref name="brief bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hirviluoto, Anna-Liisa (1929 - 2000)|url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/kb/artikkeli/8345/|website=kansallisbiografia|publisher=Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura|accessdate=14 July 2015|location=Helsinki, Finland|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her research specialty was [[iron age]] excavations like her work at the Turku (Kaarina) Ristimäki site in 1962.&lt;ref name="1962 excavation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=Valter (editor)|title=Estonian Journal of Archaeology|date=2002|publisher=University of Tartu|location=Estonia|page=60|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=XyOUjP1g26oC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as part of her duties Hirviluoto oversaw the country's road construction projects to ensure that road routes neither threatened protected areas of the Antiquities Act or the wider environmental management. Under her leadership, archival records were compiled and regional planning units began to publish lists of protected sites.&lt;ref name=curatorship&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hieta|first1=Hanneleena|title=Mukautuva museo|url=http://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/63201/Hieta13082010.pdf|publisher=University of Turku|accessdate=14 July 2015|location=Finland|page=202|language=Finnish|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annick Wilmotte''' is a Belgian [[Antarctic]] researcher, best known for her research on the diversity and ecology of Antarctic [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterial microflora]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.educapoles.org/news/news_detail/the_beldiva_scientific_team_at_princess_elisabeth_station|title=The BELDIVA scientific team at Princess Elisabeth station - News - EducaPoles - International Polar Foundation's educational site|website=www.educapoles.org|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A genus of Antarctic cyanobateria, called ''Wilmottia'' was named after her in recognition of her work in this field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bccm.belspo.be/news/new-genus-wilmottia-honor-our-bccmulc-colleague-annick-wilmotte|title=New genus Wilmottia in honor of our BCCM/ULC colleague Annick Wilmotte|last=|first=|date=|website=bccm.belspo.be|publisher=BCCM Belgian Coordinated Collections of Microorganisms|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Wilmotte completed her MSc (Botanical Sciences) at the [[University of Liège]] in 1982. Her thesis investigated the use of epiphytic marine cyanobacteria as indicators of pollution of Calvi Bay, [[Corsica]], France. She subsequently completed her PhD in Botanical Sciences from the [[University of Liège]]. The title of her thesis was "Contribution to the taxonomic and ecological characterisation of marine epiphytic Oscillatoriaceae (Cyanophyceae) of the experimental cultivation and nucleic acid studies".

==Career and impact==
Wilmotte, currently Research Associate of the FRS-FNRS, working at the [[University of Liège]], has recognized research experience in the isolation, cultivation, and characterisation of cyanobacteria by phenotypic and genotypic methods,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilmotte|first=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="547">'''Asen''' was one of several late 17th century states on the [[Ashantiland Peninsula]].

It was located south of [[Denkyira]] and thus between Denkyira and the coast.  This led to wars between the two in the 1790s caused by Denkyira wanting to maintain the trade from its realm to the coast.

The '''Asia Institute''' was founded in 1928 in [[New York City]] as the American Institute for Persian Art and Archaeology. Later, it continued its activity in [[Shiraz, Iran]] between 1966 and 1979. Its affiliations, functions, and publications have varied over the years, although it no longer exists as an organization. Two remnants of the Asia Institute are the '''''Bulletin of the Asia Institute''''', published in the United States, and the [[Narenjestan]] Museum at [[Shiraz University]], Iran.&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;''[[Iranica Online]]''. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/asia-institute-the-1 Asia Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the Asia Institute [http://www.bulletinasiainstitute.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Narenjestan Mansion website {{cite web|url=http://www.shirazu.ac.ir/en/index.php?page_id%3D1826%26menu_id%3D1%26menu_item_id%3D55 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528214320/http://www.shirazu.ac.ir/en/index.php?page_id=1826&amp;menu_id=1&amp;menu_item_id=55 |archivedate=2014-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was founded by [[Arthur Upham Pope]], who had organized an exhibition and the First International Congress on [[Persian Art]] in [[Philadelphia]] in 1926. The aim of the institute was to promote research and interest in Persian art and archaeology through exhibitions, lectures, congresses and publications, and to assist in the excavation and conservation of monuments in [[Persia]]. 

Due to close contacts with the [[Pahlavi dynasty|royal family of Iran]], Pope and his wife moved to [[Shiraz]] in 1966, where the Asia Institute was re-established as a part of [[Pahlavi University]] (now Shiraz University) and housed in the late-nineteenth-century [[Qajar dynasty|Qajari]] mansion called the Narenjestan. The institute organized the Fifth International Congress of Iranian Art and Archaeology, which took place in Tehran in 1968.

The institute in Shiraz was closed after the [[Islamic revolution]] in 1979,&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but the Narenjestan re-opened as a museum.

The '''Auschwitz Cross''' ({{lang-pl|Krzyż Oświęcimski}}), instituted on 14 March 1985, was a Polish decoration awarded to honour survivors of [[Nazi German concentration camp]]s, including [[Auschwitz]] (Auschwitz is a German name for the Polish town [[Oświęcim]], where the camps were built by Nazi Germans).

It was awarded generally to Poles, but it was possible to award it to foreigners in special cases. It could be awarded posthumously. It ceased to be awarded in 1999. An exception was made in the case of [[Greta Ferusic]], who was awarded it in February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gitelman | first = Zvi | title = American Jewish Yearbook 2004 | publisher = AJC | url = http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/2004_11_CentralEastEurope.pdf| format = pdf | accessdate =2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The award is a silver [[Greek cross]] with wide arms, 42×42&amp;nbsp;mm. The obverse shows barbed wire and camp poles; the year 1939 on the left, and 1945 on the right arm. In the center there is a red enameled triangle with the letter P, as worn by Polish nationals imprisoned in the camps. The reverse bears the inscription "PRL / WIĘŹNIOM / HITLEROWSKICH / OBOZÓW KONCENTRACYJNYCH" (People's Republic of Poland to prisoners of Nazi concentration camps).

'''Banco Angolano de Investimentos''' (formerly ''Banco Africano de Investimentos''), short ''BAI'', was founded in 1996 as the first private bank in [[Angola]]. The BAI is a full-service bank operating in Angola with a nationwide network of (mid-2012) 89 [[Branch (banking)|branches]] in all 18 provinces, with 41 of those branches in [[Luanda Province]]. In 9 of the 18 provinces, BAI operates only one branch office.

Arcinella Assets and Sforza Properties hold 7% respective 6.5% of the shares, six others hold 5% each; the remaining 48% are spread in smaller allotments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.bancobai.ao/upl/%7Bf0f3e880-08cb-4252-968b-d4291792c3e4%7D.pdf Annual report 2011, Page 173 (en)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BAI has one representation in [[Portugal]], the [[Banco BAI Europa]] S.A. with two branches, [[Lisbon]] and [[Porto]]. In 2008 BAI opened the [[Banco BAI Cabo Verde]] in [[Cape Verde]] with several branches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2176">'''Banovac''', '''banski denar''' or '''banica''' is the name of a coin struck and used in [[Croatia]] between 1235 and 1384. The name is derived from two words, ''[[Ban (title)|ban]]'' and ''[[denarius]]''. The word ''ban'' is a title of nobility used in Croatia, and roughly translates as "viceroy", whereas ''denarius'' is Latin for coins minted by the [[Roman Empire]].

Banovac included the image of a [[marten]] ({{lang-hr|kuna}}) - due to the fact that marten pelts were highly valued goods used as a form of payment in [[Slavonia]], the [[Croatian Littoral]], and [[Dalmatia]]. This was one of the reasons for naming the current currency of the [[Croatia|Republic of Croatia]] the [[Croatian kuna|kuna]]. The coins were first minted in [[Pakrac]], and from 1260 in [[Zagreb]].

The legends are:
* MONETA REGIS P SCLAVONIA (common)
* MONETA B REGIS P SCLAVONIA (moneta Belae regis pro sclavonia, scarce)
* MONETA DVCIS P SCLAVONIA (scarce)
* MONETA REGIS P VNGARIA (rare)

Initials on the Árpád Dynasty coins are:
* King [[Bela IV]] (1235–1270):
* o - o,
* lily - lily,
* bird - bird,
* h - R (Ban Henricus Nemetujvari, 1267–1270)
* King [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen V]] (1270–1272)

'''Christians in Benin''' constitute approximately 42.8 percent (~3,762,904) of the country's population (8,791,832&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bn.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; - 2009 est.)

According to the 2002 census, 27.1 percent of the population of Benin is [[Roman Catholic]], 5 percent [[Celestial Christian]], 3.2 percent [[Methodist]], 7.5 percent other [[Christianity|Christian]] groups&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90082.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Benin].

[[Christianity]] first reached Benin in 1680, gaining more permanent footing in the 19th century. [[England|English]] [[Methodists]] arrived in 1843, operating amongst the coastal [[Gun (African tribe)|Gun]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sim.org/index.php/country/BJ |title=Country Profile: Benin |publisher=Sim.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman Catholicism ==

'''''Cockroaches''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Inyenzi ou les cafards'''}}&lt;!--"Itiyenzi" is stated to mean cockroaches in "Difficult choices"--&gt;) is a 2006 memoir by [[Scholastique Mukasonga]], published by [[Éditions Gallimard]]. It was published in English in 2016 by [[Archipelago Books]], with the translation by Jordan Stump. It discusses the author's personal experiences with the [[Hutu-Tutsi conflict]], which culminated in the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-914671-53-4|title=Cockroaches|website=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=2016-08-15|volume=263|issue=33|page=42|accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukasonga referred to it as a "paper grave" to reflect how she escaped the situation and in memorial for her deceased relatives.&lt;ref name=Lucasp27&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lucas, Julian |authormask= |date=February 22, 2018 |title=Fatal beauty |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/02/22/scholastique-mukasonga-fatal-beauty/|department= |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=27–29}} - Cited: p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The initial chapters discuss life after her family, Tutsis, was removed from their hometown in [[pogroms]] which began to be held in 1959;&lt;ref name=Crapo&gt;{{cite journal|author=Crapo, Trish|title=Difficult choices|publisher=''[[The Women's Review of Books]]''|year=2017|volume=34|issue=3|pages=20-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first chapter discusses the pogroms.&lt;ref name=Hoffertp71&gt;Hoffert, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also discusses her high school period at [[Lycée Notre-Dame-de-Citeaux]], in which she was mistreated for being a Tutsi.&lt;ref name=Crapo/&gt; Mukasonga went to France in 1986 and was unable to assist her family members who perished in the genocide. When the author came back to Rwanda, she found that the her family's former residence was cleared away.&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; She recalls the names of the deceased in a notebook she is writing on while visiting [[Gitagata]] and [[Gitwe]], which were reduced to ruins. The book ends with a description of a snake she finds that she uses to symbolise the endurance of what the genocidaires tried to destroy.&lt;ref name=Lucasp29&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lucas, Julian |authormask= |date=February 22, 2018 |title=Fatal beauty |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/02/22/scholastique-mukasonga-fatal-beauty/|department= |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=27–29}} - Cited: p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicole Lamy of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the book is a "haunting, urgent personal history of the Rwandan genocide".&lt;ref name=Lamy&gt;{{cite web|author=Lamy, Nicole|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/books/review/global-literature.html|title=Match Book|publisher=''[[New York Times Book Review]]''|date=2018-01-28|page=7|accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing style==
Barbara Hoffert of ''[[Library Journal]]'' stated that the book "is related with brave, sobering, steely-eyed calm."&lt;ref name=Hoffertp71/&gt;

Russell West-Pavlov of the [[University of Tübingen]] stated that the imagery of the cockroach makes "eponymous image of" ''Cockroaches''&lt;!--Stated in the text under its French name, as the English translation was not yet released in 2014, the time of the article's publication--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=West-Pavlov, Russell|title='Regardez la vie reprendre': futurity in veronique Tadjo's L'Ombre d'imana / The Shadow of Imana.(Report)|url=http://www.scielo.org.za/pdf/tvl/v51n2/09.pdf|work=''[[Tydskrif vir Letterkunde]]''|year=2014|volume=51|issue=2|pages=114-130}} - Cited: p. 119 (PDF p. 6/16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian Lucas of the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' stated that a section describing the creation of [[urwarwa]] (a [[banana]]-based beer), an ordinary pastime for Rwandans, was the "most lyrical passage" in the book.&lt;ref name=Lucasp28&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lucas, Julian |authormask= |date=February 22, 2018 |title=Fatal beauty |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/02/22/scholastique-mukasonga-fatal-beauty/|department= |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=27–29}} - Cited: p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' stated that it is a "powerful and poignant book [that] plants itself in that terrible absence, its stone etched with a difficult, necessary grief."&lt;ref name=PW/&gt;

Lamy stated that the book "will deeply shade your map."&lt;ref name=Lamy/&gt;

Trish Crapo in the ''[[The Women's Review of Books]]'' wrote: "In the end, ''Cockroaches'' is an important book because of the human face it puts on what might otherwise remain unimaginable suffering."&lt;ref name=Crapo/&gt;

The Danish Chamber of Commerce was founded on 1 January 2007 as a result of a merger between Dansk Handel &amp; Service and the Chamber of Commerce (previously Handelskammeret, HTSI). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Erhverv,_karriere_og_ledelse/Erhvervsliv/Brancheorganisationer/Dansk_Erhverv|title=Dansk Erhverv|language=Danish|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally the organisation’s portfolio has been within the service sector, e.g. retail and wholesale, the transport sector, consultant companies, tourism and hospitality sector etc.
[[File:2017 03 21 Brian Mikkelsen.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Brian Mikkelsen]], CEO, The Danish Chamber of Commerce. Former Minister and member of The Danish Parliament.]]
The first CEO was Lars Krobæk. He was on 1 April 2008 replaced by Jens Klarskov, who was in turn on 22 June 2018 replaced by former Minister and former member of The Danish Parliament, [[Brian Mikkelsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.b.dk/politiko/brian-mikkelsen-stopper-som-minister|title=Brian Mikkelsen stopper som minister|language=Danish|publisher=Berlingske|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Goal ==
As an employers’ organisation, The Danish Chamber of Commerce negotiates a broad range of collective agreements on various areas and within many industries. The Danish Chamber of Commerce is a member of The Confederation of Danish Employers (DA).

As an employers’ organisation the Danish Chamber of Commerce is working towards securing optimal competitive conditions for Danish business. This entails protection of interests in The Danish Parliament (Folketinget), in the European Union, and in the local constituencies and in the regions.
[[File:Boersen corner 1.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Old Stock Exchange, [[Børsen|Børsen.]]]]
The Danish Chamber of Commerce owns and resides in [[Børsen|King Christian IV's Old Stock Exchange]] building on Slotsholmen in Copenhagen. Furthermore the organisation has offices in the neighbouring complex, Tietgens Hus, as well as an office in Aarhus and an EU-office in Bruxelles.

'''De Ruyter Medal''' (Dutch: De Ruyter-medaille) was created by royal decree no. 1 on 23 March 1907 by [[Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]], to be awarded to those members of the Dutch Merchant fleet who distinguish themselves by praiseworthily acts of duty for the Dutch Ship transport. The medal can be awarded in gold, silver or bronze. Awarding is on basis by nomination of the Netherlands government and by royal decree.

With the De Ruyter Medal the Kingdom of the Netherlands honors since 1907 the threehundredth birthday of [[Michiel de Ruyter]], one of the most famous admirals in Dutch history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5017">[[File:Defense Advanced GPS Receiver.jpg|thumb|right|The Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR).  Coordinates are for Rockwell Collins headquarters in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]].]]

The '''AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver''' ('''DAGR'''; colloquially, "'''dagger'''") is a handheld [[GPS]] receiver used by the [[United States Department of Defense]] and select foreign military services. It is a military-grade, dual-frequency receiver, and has the security hardware necessary to decode the encrypted P(Y)-code [[GPS signal]]s.

Manufactured by [[Rockwell Collins]], the DAGR entered production in March 2004, with the 40,000th unit delivered in September 2005. It was estimated by the news source ''Defense Industry Daily'' that, by the end of 2006, the USA and various allies around the world had issued almost $300 million worth of DAGR contracts, and ordered almost 125,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/827m-more-for-dagr-gps-receivers-02829/ $82.7M more for DAGR GPS Receivers]''. Defense Industry Daily&lt;/ref&gt; The DAGR replaced the [[Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver]] (PLGR), which was first fielded in 1994.

Due to the [[COMSEC]] electronics inside the DAGR, it is against US federal law (Title 18, United States Code, sections 641, 793, 798, and 952) for any individual or organization not authorized by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) to purchase or be in possession of the device, if knowing it to have been embezzled, stolen, purloined or converted from value of the United States or of any department or agency. When devices are no longer useful or operational, they are to be returned to an NSA-approved vendor (usually the original supplier), where they are destroyed. 

Rockwell Collins also manufactures a GPS receiver known as the "Polaris Guide", that looks like a DAGR, but uses only the civilian C/A code signals.  These units are labelled as "SPS", for "[[Standard Positioning Service]]", and may be possessed by non-military users.

==Features==
* Graphical screen, with the ability to overlay map images.
* 12-channel continuous satellite tracking for "all-in-view" operation.
* Simultaneous L1/L2 dual frequency GPS signal reception.
* Capable of Direct-Y code acquisition
* Cold start first fix in less than 100 seconds.
* Extended performance in a diverse [[Radio jamming|jamming]] environment.
** 41&amp;nbsp;dB J/S maintaining state 5 tracking.
** 24&amp;nbsp;dB during initial C/A code acquisition.
* Utilizes [[Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring]] (RAIM).
* [[SAASM|Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module]] (SAASM) compatible (currently version 3.2).
* [[Wide Area GPS Enhancement]] (WAGE) compatible.
* Resistant to multi-path effects.
* Can be used as survey for weapons systems
* Fielded to the  [[U.S. Army]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]], [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Air Force]] and select foreign military forces
* Designed to fit in a [[Battle Dress Uniform]]'s 2-magazine ammo pouch
* Approximate cost to government per unit to acquire: $1,832&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.afspc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123017018 GPS enables DAGR to track ‘bad guys’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708020114/http://www.afspc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123017018 |date=2007-07-08 }}''.

The '''dord''' is a bronze horn native to Ireland, with excavated examples dating back as far as 1000 BC, during the [[Bronze Age]]. 104 original dords are known to exist, although replicas have been built since the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larkinthemorning.com/product.asp?pn=HOR053&amp;Irish+Bronze+Age+Horns=&amp;bhcd2=1243462535]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{Failed verification|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Lark in the Morning site does not even mention the instrument.--&gt;

Though the musical tradition of the dord has been lost, modern performers such as [[Rolf Harris]] and [[Alan Dargin]] believe it was played in a manner similar to the [[didgeridoo]] and apply that technique (including [[circular breathing]] and shifts in [[timbre]]) accordingly for modern fusion music.  The Irish musician [[Simon O'Dwyer]] attempts to recreate historically accurate dord.&lt;ref&gt;Schellberg, Dirk (1994).

'''Finnish Cultural Foundation''' ({{lang-fi|Suomen Kulttuurirahasto}}) is a private [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] dedicated to the promotion of [[culture]] and [[science]] in [[Finland]]. The foundation's assets are about 1.1 billion [[euro]]s, which makes it one of the largest private foundations in Europe. Annual [[Grant (money)|grants]] were more than 31 million euros in 2013. 

Finnish Cultural Foundation consists of the main fund and 17 [[Regions of Finland|regional]] funds. It was founded in 1939 to counterbalance Finnish cultural life as the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking Finns]] received significantly more funding because of their own foundation ''[[Svenska kulturfonden]]''.

'''Intelsat 36''', also known as '''IS-36''', is a [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]] and designed and manufactured by [[SSL (company)|SSL]] on the [[SSL 1300]]  platform.&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat36 /&gt;&lt;ref name=satbeams-intelsat36 /&gt; It covers Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia from the 68.5°East longitude, providing media and content distribution with the South African [[MultiChoice]] company as anchor customer.&lt;ref name=sslmda-intelsat36official /&gt; It has a mixed [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]].&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat36 /&gt;&lt;ref name=satbeams-intelsat36 /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-intelsat36factsheet /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-intelsat36 /&gt;

==Satellite description==
'''Intelsat 36''' was designed and manufactured by [[SSL (company)|SSL]] on the [[SSL 1300]].&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat36 /&gt;&lt;ref name=satbeams-intelsat36 /&gt; It has a launch mass of {{convert|3253|kg|abbr=on}} and a design life of more than 15 years. When stowed for launch, the satellite measures {{convert|5.2|x|3.1|x|3.4|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=arianespace-launchkitav232 /&gt; It is powered by two wings, with three panels each and is designed to generate 15.8&amp;nbsp;kW at the end of its design life.&lt;ref name=arianespace-launchkitav232 /&gt;

Its payload is composed of 20 [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]] and 34 [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]].&lt;ref name=arianespace-launchkitav232 /&gt; The C band will be used for content distribution in the Sub-Sahara African and South Asia regions. The K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; will be used by the anchor customer for Sub-Sahara Africa content distribution.&lt;ref name=intelsat-intelsat36factsheet /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-intelsat36 /&gt;

==History==
On August 4, 2014, then [[SSL (company)|Space Systems/Loral]] (now SSL) announced that it had been awarded a contract with [[Intelsat]] for a new communications satellite. Continuing with a four decades business relationship, '''Intelsat 36''' would be designed to provide media and content distribution services in Africa and South Asia. Its anchor customer would be [[MultiChoice]] of South Africa.&lt;ref name=sslmda-pr20140804 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sslmda-1300history /&gt;

On July 15, 2016, Senior Space Program Managers Richard Laurie and Brian Sing blogged that they had been on the Boeing factory overseeing the transport preparations for [[Intelsat 33e]] to [[French Guiana]]. There it would join Intelsat 36, for integration on the [[Ariane 5 ECA]] launcher, which was expected to launch on August 24.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160715 /&gt;

On July 26, 2016, SSL announced the arrival that same day of Intelsat 36 to the space port in [[Kourou]].&lt;ref name=sslmda-pr20160726 /&gt; At the French launch site, even though Intelsat is the owner of the two passengers of the Ariane 5 VA 232 flight, they have separate launch teams. Each satellite is built by a different manufacturer, and it has a different supervisor team within Intelsat.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160727 /&gt;

On August 24, 2016, at 22:16:01&amp;nbsp;UTC, after a slight delay due to a rocket issue, the Ariane 5 ECA VA-232 flight launched from [[Guiana Space Center]] [[ELA-3]], with Intelsat 33e riding the upper position and Intelsat 36 enclosed under the [[SYLDA]].&lt;ref name=nsf-20160824 /&gt; At 22:57&amp;nbsp;UTC, Intelsat 36 separated from the rocket's upper stage.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160824 /&gt; Intelsat confirmed that it had received the satellites signals as expected after separation.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160824 /&gt;&lt;ref name=spaceflightnow-20160824 /&gt; Arianespace estimated the insertion orbit as 248.7&amp;nbsp;km × 35,858&amp;nbsp;km × 5.98°, very close to the target of 249.0&amp;nbsp;km × 35,879&amp;nbsp;km × 6.00°.&lt;ref name=arianespace-pr20160824 /&gt;

'''John Wesley A.M.E. Zion Church''' is a historic [[African American]] [[Black church|church]] in the [[Hill District]] of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The church, which is one of Pittsburgh’s oldest African American faith-based organizations, was founded in 1836 following a series of prayer meetings and preaching services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aybCUIvplxIC&amp;pg=PA389&amp;lpg=PA389&amp;dq=%22John+Wesley+A.M.E.+Zion+Church%22+Pittsburgh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PFjjkkgWp2&amp;sig=Md7xPCqcAAEc5I1POzc9F7Oq5Qw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9umSSaGfNOCbtwe5lNjcCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result#PPA389,M1 |title=African Americans in Pennsylvania: Shifting Historical Perspectives |author1=Joe William Trotter |author2=Joe William Trotter, Jr. |author3=Eric Ledell Smith | publisher=Penn State Press| page=389| year=1997| isbn=0-271-01687-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;		

On October 11, 1993, the church received City of Pittsburgh Historic Designation as a local landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =City of Pittsburgh Historic Designation | publisher =Pittsburgh History &amp; Landmarks Foundation | date = | url =http://www.phlf.org/historic-plaque-program/local-historic-designations/ | accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the following year the congregation was forced to temporarily abandon the church property following flooding that was created by waters from an abandoned {{convert|100|acre|adj=on}} mine that ran below the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Allison M.

At the DEP’s suggestion, a [[geothermal]] system was installed in November 2008 that used the runoff from the mine water to provide heating and cooling for the church building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Phil Hall | title =Guidance From Above, Heating From Below |publisher =Alternative Energy Retailer | date =October 21, 2008 | url =http://www.aer-online.com/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.2059 | accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maltese lace''' is a style of [[bobbin lace]] made in [[Malta]]. It is a [[guipure]] style of lace. It is worked as a continuous width on a tall, thin, upright [[lace pillow]]. Bigger pieces are made of two or more parts sewn together.

The Lace Pillow in Malta is known as "Trajbu" pronounced as try-boo , while the Bobbins are called "Combini" pronounced as "chom-beany", this type of Lace making is very popular in Malta's Sister Island of Gozo, which is found to the North of the main Island. 
==History==
Lace made in Malta was originally [[needle lace]], from the 16th to the 19th century, when the economic depression in the islands nearly led to the extinction of lacemaking there. But in the mid 1800s, Lady Hamilton Chichester sent lacemakers from Genoa to Malta. They used the old needle lace patterns and turned them into bobbin lace, which was quicker. It was not long after its introduction that the Maltese lace developed its own style from Genoese lace.

Maltese lace was shown at [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851 and it became popular in Britain. The style was copied by lacemakers in the English Midlands, and it was one of the sources for [[Bedfordshire lace]].

Lace is still made in Malta today. To ensure the survival of the craft, lace making is taught in Government trade schools for girls, while private bodies such as the Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce also hold special evening classes.&lt;ref name=crafts&gt;{{cite web| url=https://vassallohistory.wordpress.com/maltese-crafts/ |title=Maltese Crafts |publisher=VassaloMalta| accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of Maltese lace==
Maltese lace usually has the following characteristics which are useful for identification:
* It is usually made from cream [[silk]]. Black silk was also used in the past. Occasionally [[linen]] thread was used.
* There is often the 8 pointed [[Maltese cross]] as part of the pattern, worked in whole or cloth stitch.
* The pattern may also have closely worked leaves known as “wheat ears” or “oats”. These are plump and rounded in shape, rather than the long narrow leaves of other types of bobbin lace. &lt;ref name=crafts/&gt;

'''Osusu''' is a form of microfinancial [[capital accumulation]] found in [[Africa]]. "Osusus" (known as a [[tontine]] in [[francophone]] countries and [[Tanda_(association)]] in Latin American countries) are small groups such as in [[Sierra Leone]] 'where, for example, ten people put Le 5,000 in a pot and then one of the ten takes the resulting Le 50,000 for his or her own use, promising to put in Le 5,000 at the next group meeting to continue the process.'&lt;ref&gt;UNDP Microfinance Assessment Report: Prepared as a component of the MicroStart Feasibility Mission - March, 1997: Gary Walker&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[money]] is collected on a daily, weekly, and/or monthly basis by what is known as a thrift collector. Thrift collectors are typically male.&lt;ref name="fao.org"&gt;United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Document Repository Section 5.5 Savings and Contribution - http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/x0207e/x0207e06.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="https://www.google.com.ng/search?q=wht+is+G7&amp;oq=wht+is+G7&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=what+is+minisaving"&gt;Minisaving is a daily saving Platform that allows Individuals, Petty Traders and SME's to save from their daily sales. - http://www.minisaving.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in the Osusu must pay the thrift collector a participation fee depending on the rate to which they contribute money. If they contribute daily they owe the thrift collector one full days contribution every eighth day. If they contribute weekly they owe the thrift collector 1/7 the contribution amount weekly.&lt;ref name="fao.org"/&gt;

An Osusu continues to conduct turns until each member has a chance to use the money. Once each member has done so the group may either discontinue using the Osusu or restart the process.

Campaigns to start Osusus have even reached as far as the [[West Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Dr. Cecilia Williams Bryant - http://shaw.eventquick.com/emmpublic/presenterdetail?PRS_ID=8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Howard Stern Wrap-Up Show''''' (commonly just called '''''The Wrap-Up Show''''') is a radio show that follows ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' on [[Howard 100]], an uncensored channel on [[Sirius XM Radio]]. Hosted by [[Jon Hein]] and Executive producer [[Gary Dell'Abate]], the show discusses everything that happened on that day's Stern Show with listeners and various celebrity guests.

Because ''The Howard Stern Show'' is contractually bound to broadcast a minimum of four hours on Sirius XM, there is no set time when the show ends, or effectively when ''The Howard Stern Wrap-Up Show'' begins. Regardless, ''The Howard Stern Wrap-Up Show'' always follows the main show and broadcasts for about an hour.

Prior to 2015, ''The Howard Stern Wrap-Up Show'' was open for all show staff members to discuss topics along with Hein and Dell'Abate; however, the show now only features the hosts and a revolving panel of guests discussing ''The Howard Stern Show'' and each guest's respective promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOWARD 100 &amp; 101|url=https://www.howardstern.com/howard101/|website=HowardStern.com|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Walla Zaman Ya Selahy'''" ({{Lang-ar|والله زمان يا سلاحي}}) was the [[national anthem]] of the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR), a federation of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]], from 1960. Though the UAR broke up in 1961, Egypt retained the official name of the union until 1971, and the official anthem until 1979.
==History==
{{National anthems of Iraq}}
Prior to being adopted as the UAR anthem, it was a nationalist song performed by [[Umm Kulthum]] during the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, known in Egypt and the [[Arab world]] as the Tripartite Aggression, when Egypt was invaded by the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Israel]]. Due to its strongly nationalist lyrics evoking national resistance, the song was played frequently on Egyptian radio during the war, sometimes as often as every 10 minutes.

The popularity of the song led to it being adopted as the national anthem of the UAR two years after the establishment of the union. It replaced the former Egyptian anthem, "[[Nashid al-Huriyya]]" (''The Anthem of Liberty'', نشيد الحرية, composed and sung by [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]]), which was adopted following the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]] and the abolition of the monarchy, as well as the former [[national anthem of Syria]].

The lyrics were written by [[Salah Jahin]], with music by [[Kamal Al Taweel]]. The anthem was also used, without words, by [[Iraq]] from 1965 to 1981.

It was eventually replaced in 1979 for the peace negotiations with Israel by President Sadate as Egypt's national anthem by the less militant "[[Bilady, Bilady, Bilady]]", which continues to be Egypt's anthem today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?hl=nl&amp;id=h05vgm9bZkYC&amp;q=menachim#v=snippet&amp;q=menachim&amp;f=false Virginia Danielson, "The Voice of Egypt": Umm Kulthum, Arabic Song, and Egyptian Society in the Twentieth Century (Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology), p. 243]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
والله زمــان يـا سـلاحـي
اشتـقـت لـك في كـفـاحي
انطق وقـول أنـا صاحـي
يــا حــرب والله زمــان

والله زمـان ع الجــنــود
زاحفة بـتـرعـد رعـود
حالـفة تـروح لم تـعـود
إلا بـنـصــر الـزمــان

همـوا وضـمـوا الصـفـوف
شيلوا الحياة ع الكفوف
ياما العدو راح يـشـوف
منكـم في نـار المـيـدان

يـا مجـدنـا يـا مجـدنـا
يا اللي اتبنـيت من عندنا
بـشـقــانـا وكــدنــا
عـمـرك مـا تبقى هـوان

مصر الحرة مين يحميهــــا
نحـميهـا بـسلاحـنـــا  
أرض الثورة مين يفديهـا
نفـديها بأرواحـنــا
  
الشعب بيزحـف زى النور
الشعب جبال الشعـب بحور
بركان غضبان بركان بيفور
زلزال بيـشق لهم في قبور

&lt;poem&gt;
It has been a long time oh my weapon! 
I long for you in my struggle! 
Speak and say I am awake, 
Oh war it has been a long time. 
 
It has been a long time for the soldiers, 
Advancing with thunderous roar, 
Swearing never to return, 
Except with epoch-making victory.

Rise and close ranks, 
With lives ready for sacrifice. 
O! the horror that the enemy shall suffer, 
From you in the fire of the battlefield. 
 
O! glory our glory, 
You who was built by us, 
By toil and pain, 
Never to go to waste. 
 
Who shall protect Free Egypt? 
We shall protect her with our weapons. 
Land of the Revolution, who will sacrifice for her sake? 
We will, with our souls. 
 
The people advance like the light, 
The people stand like mountains and seas, 
Volcanoes of anger, volcanoes erupting, 
Earthquakes digging the enemy into their graves. 
&lt;/poem&gt;
