The '''1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine''' was the first phase of the [[1948 Palestine war]]. It broke out after the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] adopted a resolution on 29 November 1947 recommending the adoption of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Partition Plan for Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/038/88/IMG/NR003888.pdf?OpenElement Resolution 181 (II).

During the civil war, the [[Yishuv|Jewish]] and [[Arabs|Arab communities]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] clashed (the latter supported by the [[Arab Liberation Army]]) while the British, who had the obligation to maintain order,&lt;ref name="Urofsky1982"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melvin I.

When the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] expired on 14 May 1948, and with the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]], the surrounding Arab states—[[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Jordan|Transjordan]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Syrian Republic (1946–63)|Syria]]—invaded what had just ceased to be Mandatory Palestine,&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2008 p.180"&gt;[[#morris 1948|Benny Morris (2008)]], p. 180 and further&lt;/ref&gt; and immediately attacked Israeli forces and several Jewish settlements.&lt;ref name="morris2008p236"/&gt;  The conflict then turned into the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Background==
Under the control of a British administration since 1920, the area of Palestine found itself the object of a battle between Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] nationalists and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] nationalists, who opposed one another just as much as they both opposed the British mandate.

The Palestinian Arab backlash culminated in the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. Directed by Palestinian Arab nationalists, the rebels opposed Zionism, the British presence in Palestine and Palestinian Arab politicians who called for pan-Arabic nationalism at the same time. Both the British and the Zionist organizations of the time opposed the revolt; nonetheless, the Palestinian Arab nationalists did obtain from the British a drastic reduction of Jewish immigration, legislated by the [[1939 White Paper]]. However, the consequences of the unsuccessful uprising were heavy. Nearly 5,000 Arabs and 500 Jews died; the various paramilitary Zionist organizations were reinforced, and the majority of the members of the Palestinian Arab political elite exiled themselves, such as [[Amin al-Husseini]], leader of the Arab Higher Committee.

After World War II and [[The Holocaust]], the [[Zionist movement]] gained attention and sympathy. In Mandatory Palestine, Zionist groups [[British–Zionist conflict|fought]] against the British occupation. In the two and a half years from 1945 to June 1947, British law enforcement forces lost 103 dead, and sustained 391 wounded from Jewish militants.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Laurens, ''La Question de Palestine,'' volume 2,  Fayard, Paris 2002 pp.571-572.&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinian Arab nationalists reorganized themselves, but their organization remained inferior to that of the Zionists. Nevertheless, the weakening of the colonial British Empire reinforced Arab countries and the [[Arab League]].

The [[Haganah]], a Jewish paramilitary organization, was initially involved in the post-war attacks against the British in Palestine but withdrew following the outrage caused by the 1946 [[Irgun]] bombing of the British Army Headquarters in the [[King David Hotel bombing|King David Hotel]]. In May 1946, on the assumption of British neutrality in the future hostilities, a Plan C was formulated that envisaged guidelines for retaliation if and when Palestinian Arab attacks took place on the Yishuv. As the countdown ticked down, the Haganah implemented assaults involving the torching and demolition by explosives against economic infrastructures, the property of Palestinian politicians and military commanders, villages, town neighbourhoods, houses and farms that were deemed to be bases or used by inciters and their accomplices. The killing of armed irregulars and adult males was also foreseen.  On 15 August 1947, on suspicion it was a terrorist headquarters, they blew up the house of the Abu Laban family, prosperous Palestinian orange growers, near [[Petah Tikva]]. Twelve occupants, including a woman and six children, were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Walid Khalidi. "Before their Diaspora." IPS 1984. {{ISBN|0-88728-143-5}}. p. 253. Benny Morris, ''The Birth of the Palestinian refugee problem, 1947–1949'', 2004 p. 343. Morris gives no precise date or number of casualties but describes the house as "suspected of being an Arab terrorist headquarters." He also states that on 20 May 1947 the Palamach blew up a coffee house in Fajja after the murder of two Jews in Petah Tikva.&lt;/ref&gt; After November 1947, the dynamiting of houses formed a key component of most Haganah retaliatory strikes.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004 p.343:9 December 1947, the Givati brigade blew up a house in the village of [[Karatiyya]]; on 11 December a house was blown up in Haifa's Wadi Rishmiya neighbourhood. On 18 December 1947, two houses were destroyed by the Palmach in a raid on [[Al-Khisas|Khisas]] in the Galilee; On 19 December, the house of the mukhtar of [[Qazaza]] was partially demolished to revenge the murder of a Jew; On December 26, several houses were blown up in [[Silwan]]; on 27 December 3 houses were blown up in [[Yalo|Yalu]]; On 4 January 1948 Etzioni blew up the Christian-owned [[Semiramis Hotel bombing|Semiramis Hotel]] in Jerusalem's [[Katamon]] quarter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomacy failed to reconcile the different points of view concerning the future of Palestine. On 18 February 1947, the British announced their withdrawal from the region. Later that year, on 29 November, the General Assembly of the United Nations voted to recommend the adoption and implementation of the [[1947 UN Partition plan|partition plan]] with the support of the big global powers, but not of Britain nor of the Arab States.

In the aftermath of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|adoption of Resolution 181(II)]] by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] recommending the adoption and implementation of the Plan of Partition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |title=A/RES/181(II) of 29 November 1947 |first= |last= |work=domino.un.org |year=1947 |accessdate=11 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524094913/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the manifestations of joy of the Jewish community were counterbalanced by protests by Arabs throughout the country&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,934119,00.html Extracts from Time Magazine of that time]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5sXJCFa?url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,934119,00.html |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after 1 December, the [[Arab Higher Committee]] enacted a [[general strike]] that lasted three days.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'wind of violence'&lt;ref&gt;This expression is taken from [[#pappé|Ilan Pappé (2000)]], p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; rapidly took hold of the country, foreboding civil war between the two communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Murders, reprisals, and counter-reprisals came fast on each other's heels, resulting in dozens of victims killed on both sides in the process. The impasse persisted as British forces did not intervene to put a stop to the escalating cycles of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#pappé|Ilan Pappé (2000)]], p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris 2008, p. 76"&gt;Morris 2008, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Efraïm Karsh 2002 p.30"&gt;[[#karsh|Efraïm Karsh (2002)]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.101"&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The first casualties after the adoption of Resolution 181(II) by the General Assembly were passengers on a Jewish bus driving on the Coastal Plain near [[Kfar Sirkin]] on 30 November. An eight-man gang from Jaffa ambushed the bus killing five and wounding others. Half an hour later they ambushed a second bus, southbound from [[Hadera]], killing two more. Arab snipers attacked Jewish buses in Jerusalem and Haifa.&lt;ref name="Morris 2008, p. 76"/&gt;

[[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] (the latter also known as the Stern Gang) followed their strategy of placing bombs in crowded markets and bus-stops.&lt;ref&gt;B. Morris, 2004, ''The Birth of the Palestinian refugee problem revisited'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; As on 30 December, in Haifa, when members of [[Irgun]], threw two bombs at a crowd of Arab workers who were queueing in front of a refinery, killing 6 of them and injuring 42. An angry crowd [[Haifa Oil Refinery massacre|massacred]] 39 Jewish people in revenge, until British soldiers reestablished calm.&lt;ref name="Efraïm Karsh 2002 p.30"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Palestine Post]]'' of 31 December 1947: [http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Skins/TAUEn/Client.asp?Skin=TAUEn&amp;enter=true&amp;sPublication=PLS&amp;Publication=PLS&amp;Hs=advanced&amp;AW=1291929116843&amp;AppName=2 Archives of the newspaper]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5sY0qGG?url=http://www.jpress.org.il/Default/Skins/TAUEn/Client.asp?Skin=TAUEn&amp;enter=true&amp;sPublication=PLS&amp;Publication=PLS&amp;Hs=advanced&amp;AW=1291929116843&amp;AppName=2 |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reprisals, some soldiers from the strike force, [[Palmach]] and the [[Carmeli brigade]], [[Balad al-Shaykh massacre|attacked the village]] of Balad ash-Sheikh and Hawassa. According to different historians, this attack led to between 21 and 70 deaths.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.101"/&gt;

According to [[Benny Morris]], much of the fighting in the first months of the war took place in and on the edges of the main towns, and was initiated by the Arabs. It included Arab snipers firing at Jewish houses, pedestrians, and traffic, as well as planting bombs and mines along urban and rural paths and roads.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2008 p.101"&gt;[[#morris 1948|Benny Morris (2008)]], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

From January onwards, operations became increasingly militarized.

In all the mixed zones where both communities lived, particularly [[Jerusalem]] and [[Haifa]], increasingly violent attacks, [[1947 Jerusalem riots|riots]], reprisals and counter-reprisals followed each other. Isolated shootings evolved into all-out [[battle]]s. Attacks against traffic, for instance, turned into ambushes as one bloody attack led to another.

On 22 February 1948, supporters of [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]] organized, with the help of certain British deserters, three attacks against the Jewish community. Using [[car bomb]]s aimed at the headquarters of the pro-Zionist ''[[Jerusalem Post|Palestine Post]]'' newspaper, the [[Ben Yehuda Street bombings|Ben Yehuda St. market]] and the backyard of the Jewish Agency's offices, they killed 22, 53 and 13 Jewish people respectively, and injured hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#karsh|Efraïm Karsh (2002)]], p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; In revenge, [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] put a [[Cairo–Haifa train bombings 1948|landmine on the railroad track]] in [[Rehovot]] on which a train from [[Cairo]] to [[Haifa]] was travelling, killing 28 British soldiers and injuring 35.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 March 1948&lt;/ref&gt; This would be copied on 31 March, close to [[Caesarea Maritima]], which would lead to the death of forty people, injuring 60, who were, for the most part, Arab civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Newspapers of the time: ''[[The Palestine Post]]'', 1 April 1948 and ''[[The Times]]'', on the same day, attribute the incident to Lehi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having recruited a few thousand volunteers, al-Husayni organized the blockade of the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Larry Collins 1971 p.7"&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], chap. 7, pp. 131–153&lt;/ref&gt; To counter this, the [[Yishuv]] authorities tried to supply the city with convoys of up to 100 armoured vehicles, but the operation became more and more impractical as the number of casualties in the relief convoys surged. By March, Al-Hussayni's tactic had paid off. Almost all of Haganah's armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.163"&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The situation for those who dwelt in the Jewish settlements in the highly isolated [[Negev]] and North of Galilee was even more critical.

According to the [[Arab League]] general Safwat: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the fact that skirmishes and battles have begun, the Jews at this stage are still trying to contain the fighting to as narrow a sphere as possible in the hope that partition will be implemented and a Jewish government formed; they hope that if the fighting remains limited, the Arabs will acquiesce in the fait accompli. This can be seen from the fact that the Jews have not so far attacked Arab villages unless the inhabitants of those villages attacked them or provoked them first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khalidi |first=Walid |title=Selected Documents on the 1948 Palestine War |url=http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/military/Khalidi,%20Selected%20Docs%20on%201948%20War.pdf |pages=70 |year=1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109141732/http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/military/Khalidi%2C%20Selected%20Docs%20on%201948%20War.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although a certain level of doubt took hold among Yishuv supporters, their apparent defeats were due more to their wait-and-see policy than to weakness.{{Citation needed|reason=mistake|date=January 2014}} [[David Ben-Gurion]] reorganized Haganah and made conscription obligatory. Every Jewish man and woman in the country had to receive military training.

===Allied Powers' policies===
This situation caused the [[United States]] to withdraw their support for the Partition plan, thus encouraging the [[Arab League]] to believe that the Palestinian Arabs, reinforced by the Arab Liberation Army, could put an end to the plan for partition. The British, on the other hand, decided on 7 February 1948, to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by [[Jordan|Transjordan]].&lt;ref name="Henry Laurens 2005 p.83"&gt;[[#laurens|Henry Laurens (2005)]], p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population evacuations===
While the Jewish population had received strict orders requiring them to hold their ground everywhere at all costs,&lt;ref name="Larry Collins 1971 p.163"&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; the Arab population was more affected by the general conditions of insecurity to which the country was exposed. Up to 100,000 Arabs, from the urban upper and middle classes in Haifa, Jaffa and Jerusalem, or Jewish-dominated areas, evacuated abroad or to Arab centres eastwards.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.67"&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighters and arms from abroad===
As a consequence of funds raised by [[Golda Meir]] which were donated by sympathisers in the United States, and [[Josef Stalin|Stalin]]'s decision to support the [[Zionism|Zionist]] cause, the Jewish representatives of Palestine were able to sign very important armament contracts in the East. Other Haganah agents recuperated stockpiles from the Second World War, which helped improve the army's equipment and logistics. [[Operation Balak]] allowed arms and other equipment to be transported for the first time by the end of March.

There was an intervention of a number of [[Arab Liberation Army]] regiments inside Palestine, each active in a variety of distinct sectors around the different coastal towns. They consolidated their presence in [[Galilee]] and [[Samaria]].&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 pp.51-56"&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], pp. 51–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] came from Egypt with several hundred men of the [[Army of the Holy War]].

German and Bosnian WWII veterans, including former intelligence, [[Wehrmacht]], and [[Waffen SS]] officers, were among the 'volunteers' fighting for the Palestinian cause&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris 2008, p.85"&lt;/ref&gt; Veterans of WWII [[Axis Powers|Axis]] militaries were represented in the ranks of the ALA forces commanded by [[Fawzi al-Qawuqji]] (who had been awarded an officer's rank in the Wehrmacht during WWII)&lt;ref name = "Höpp, 1995"&gt;“Ruhmloses Zwischenspiel: Fawzi al-Qawuqji in Deutschland, 1941–1947,” by Gerhard Höpp in Peter Heine, ed., Al-Rafidayn: Jahrbuch zu Geschichte und Kultur des modernen Iraq (Würzburg: Ergon Verlag, 1995), (http://www.zmo.de/biblio/nachlass/hoepp/01_30_064.pdf) p.16&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Mufti's forces, commanded by Abd al-Qadir (who had fought with the Germans against the British in Iraq) and Salama (who served as a Waffen SS commando during WWII).&lt;ref name="RubinSchwanitz2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barry Rubin|author2=Wolfgang G. Schwanitz|title=Nazis, Islamists, and the Making of the Modern Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHe9AgAAQBAJ|date=25 February 2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-14090-3|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Germans who served the Mufti in his Nablus headquarters were Adolf Schwabe, Albert Grossman, and Rudolf Hoffman.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris 2008 p.435&lt;/ref&gt;

Benny Morris writes that the Yishuv was more successful in attracting and effectively deploying foreign military professionals than their Arab adversaries.  He concludes that the ex-Nazis and Bosnian Muslims recruited by the Palestinians, Egyptians, and Syrians "proved of little significance" to the outcome of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris 2008, p.403"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death toll===
Morris says that by the end of March 1948, the Yishuv had suffered about a thousand dead.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2008 p.112"&gt;[[#morris 1948|Benny Morris (2008)]], p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilan Pappé]] estimates that 400 Jews and 1,500 Arabs were killed by January 1948.&lt;ref name=Pappep72&gt;[[#Pappep72|Ilan Pappe (2006)]], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In December the Jewish death toll was estimated over 200 and, according to [[Alec Kirkbride]], by 18 January 333 Jews and 345 Arabs were killed while 643 Jews and 877 Arabs were injured.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber2004|Yoav Gelber (2004)]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The overall death toll between December 1947 and January 1948 (including British personnel) was estimated at around 1,000 people, with 2,000 injured.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/FDF734EB76C39D6385256C4C004CDBA7 Special UN report] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5sZ1pPb?url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/FDF734EB76C39D6385256C4C004CDBA7 |date=19 December 2010 }} by the United Nations Special Commission (16 February 1948), § II.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yoav Gelber, by the end of March there was a total of 2,000 dead and 4,000 wounded.&lt;ref name="gelber85"/&gt; These figures correspond to an average of more than 100 deaths and 200 casualties per week in a population of 2,000,000.

==Intervention of foreign forces in Palestine==
[[File:Arab volunteers.jpg|thumb|right|Arab volunteers fighting in Palestine in 1947]]
Violence kept intensifying with the intervention of military units. Although responsible for law and order up until the end of the mandate, the British did not try to take control of the situation, being more involved in the liquidation of the administration and the evacuation of their troops.&lt;ref&gt;[[#rapport special|United Nations Special Commission (16 February 1948)]], § II.9.c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the authorities felt that they had lost enough men already in the conflict.

The British either could not or did not want to impede the intervention of foreign forces into Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;This policy would change; at the end of the mandate, the High Commissioner, [[Alan Cunningham]], opposed the deployment of [[Arab Legion]] troops into the territory and threatened the Arab states with [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] intervention if they grouped their forces around the border or crossed it. ([[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 115)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Carl Brown, ''Diplomacy in the Middle East: The International Relations of Regional and Outside powers'', I.B.Tauris, 2004, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a special report by the UN Special Commission on Palestine:&lt;ref&gt;[[#rapport special|United Nations Special Commission (16 February 1948)]], § II.7&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the night of 20–21 January, a force of 700 [[Syrian people|Syrians]] in battle dress, well-equipped, with mechanized transport, entered Palestine 'via [[Jordan|Transjordan]].'
* On 27 January, 'a band of 300 men from outside Palestine, was established in the area of [[Safed]] in [[Galilee]] and was probably responsible for the intensive heavy weapon and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] attacks the following week against the settlement of Yechiam.'
* During the night of 29–30 January, a battalion of the [[Arab Liberation Army]], 950 men in 19 vehicles commanded by Fawzi al-Qawuqji, entered Palestine 'via [[Adam Bridge]] and dispersed itself around the villages of [[Nablus]], [[Jenin]], and [[Tulkarem]].'

This description corresponds to the entry of Arab Liberation Army troops between 10 January and the start of March:&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 pp.51-56"/&gt;

* The Second regiment of [[Yarmouk River|Yarmouk]], under the orders of [[Adib Shishakli]]&lt;ref&gt;Shishakli would seize the power in Syria between 29 October 1951 and 25 February 1954 ([[#laurens|Henry Laurens (2005)]], pp. 115–116)&lt;/ref&gt; entered [[Galilee]] via [[Lebanon]] on the night of 11–12 January. The battalion passed through [[Safed]] and then settled in the village of Sasa. A third of the regiment's fighters were Palestinian Arabs, and a quarter were [[Syrian people|Syrian]].
* The 1st Yarmouk regiment, commanded by Muhammad Tzafa, entered Palestine on the night of 20–21 January, via the Bridge of Damia from Jordan and dispersed around [[Samaria]], where it established its HQ, in the Northern Samarian city of [[Tubas]]. The regiment was composed chiefly of Palestinian Arabs and [[Iraqi people|Iraqis]].
* The Hittin regiment, commanded by Madlul Abbas, settled in the west of Samaria with its headquarters in [[Tulkarem]].
* The Hussein ibn Ali regiment provided reinforcement in [[Haifa]], [[Jaffa]], [[Jerusalem]], and several other cities.
* The Qadassia regiment were reserves based in Jab'a.

Fawzi al-Qawuqji, Field Commander of the Arab Liberation Army, arrived, according to his own account, on 4 March, with the rest of the logistics and around 100 [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] volunteers in Jab'a, a small village on the route between [[Nablus]] and [[Jenin]]. He established a headquarters there and a training centre for Palestinian Arab volunteers.

[[Alan Cunningham]], the British [[High Commissioner]] in Palestine, thoroughly protested against the incursions and the fact that 'no serious effort is being made to stop incursions'. The only reaction came from Alec Kirkbride, who complained to [[Ernest Bevin]] about Cunningham's "hostile tone and threats".&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The British and the information service of Yishuv expected an offensive for 15 February, but it would not take place, seemingly because the Mufti troops were not ready.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, an Iraqi regiment of the Arab Liberation Army came to reinforce the Palestinian Arab troops of [[Hasan Salama|Salameh]] in the area around [[Lod|Lydda]] and [[Ramleh]], while Al-Hussayni started a headquarters in Bir Zeit, 10&amp;nbsp;km to the north of Ramallah.&lt;ref name = "gelber56"&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a number of North African troops, principally [[Libya]]ns, and hundreds of members of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] entered Palestine. In March, an initial regiment arrived in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and certain militants among them reached [[Jaffa]].

==Morale of the fighters==
The Arab combatants' initial victories reinforced morale among them.&lt;ref name="united1948"&gt;[[#rapport special|United Nations Special Commission (16 February 1948)]], § II.7.3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arab Higher Committee]] was confident and decided to prevent the set-up of the UN-backed partition plan. In an announcement made to the Secretary-General on 6 February, they declared:&lt;ref&gt;[[#rapport special|United Nations Special Commission (16 February 1948)]], § II.6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Palestinian Arabs consider any attempt by Jewish people or by whatever power or group of power to establish a Jewish state in an Arab territory to be an act of aggression that will be resisted by force [...]&lt;br /&gt;
The prestige of the United Nations would be better served by abandoning this plan and by not imposing such an injustice [...]&lt;br /&gt;
The Palestinian Arabs make a grave declaration before the UN, before God and before history that they will never submit to any power that comes to Palestine to impose a partition. The only way to establish a partition is to get rid of them all: men, women, and children.}}

At the beginning of February 1948, the morale of the Jewish leaders was not high: "distress and despair arose clearly from the notes taken at the meetings of the Mapai party."&lt;ref&gt;[[#pappé|Ilan Pappé (2000)]], p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; "The attacks against the Jewish settlements and main roads worsened the direction of the Jewish people, who underestimated the intensity of the Arab reaction."&lt;ref&gt;[[#pappé|Ilan Pappé (2000)]], p. 113, quoting Milstein, Milhemet, vol. 2, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The situation of the 100,000 Jews situated in [[Jerusalem]] was precarious, and supplies to the city, already slim in number, were likely to be stopped. Nonetheless, despite the setbacks suffered, the Jewish forces, in particular [[Haganah]], remained superior in number and quality to those of the Arab forces.&lt;ref name="Henry Laurens 2005 p.83"/&gt;

==First wave of Palestinian refugees==
{{Nakba}}
{{Main article|1948 Palestinian exodus}}
The high morale of the Arab fighters and politicians was not shared by the Palestinian Arab civilian population. The UN Palestine Commission reported 'Panic continues to increase, however, throughout the Arab middle classes, and there is a steady exodus of those who can afford to leave the country.&lt;ref name="united1948"/&gt; 'From December 1947 to January 1948, around 70,000 Arabs fled,&lt;ref&gt;[[#pappé|Ilan Pappé (2000)]], p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; and, by the end of March, that number had grown to around 100,000.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.67"/&gt;

These people were part of the first wave of Palestinian refugees of the conflict. Mostly the middle and upper classes fled, including the majority of the families of local governors and representatives of the [[Arab Higher Committee]].&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.67"/&gt; Non-Palestinian Arabs also fled in large numbers. Most of them did not abandon the hope of returning to Palestine once the hostilities had ended.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies of foreign powers==
Many decisions were made abroad that had an important influence over the outcome of the conflict.

===Britain and the Jordanian choice===
Britain did not want a Palestinian state led by the [[Mufti]], and opted unofficially instead, on 7 February 1948, to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by [[Abdullah I of Jordan]].&lt;ref name="Henry Laurens 2005 p.83"/&gt; At a meeting in London between the commander of [[Jordan|Transjordan]]'s [[Arab Legion]], [[Glubb Pasha]], and [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]], [[Ernest Bevin]], the two parties agreed that they would facilitate the entry of the Arab Legion into Palestine on 15 May and that the Arab part of Palestine be occupied by it. However, they held that the Arab Legion not enter the vicinity of Jerusalem or the Jewish state itself.&lt;ref name="Henry Laurens 2005 p.83"/&gt; This option did not envisage a Palestinian Arab state. Although the ambitions of King Abdullah are known, it is not apparent to what extent the authorities of Yishuv, the [[Arab Higher Committee]] or the [[Arab League]] knew of this decision.

===United States turnabout===
In mid-March, after the increasing disorder in Palestine and faced with the fear, later judged unfounded, of an Arab petrol embargo,&lt;ref&gt;[[#laurens|Henry Laurens (2005)]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; the US government announced the possible withdrawal of its support for the UN's partition plan and for dispatching an international force to guarantee its implementation. The US suggested that instead Palestine be put under [[American trusteeship proposal for Palestine|UN supervision]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p.71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April, the [[UN Security Council]] voted on the US proposal to convoke a special assembly to reconsider the Palestinian problem; the [[Soviet Union]] abstained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indaily.net/?p=1299 See the entry at 1 April 1948] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5sZCOaM?url=http://indaily.net/?p=1299 |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This U-turn by the US caused concern and debate among Yishuv authorities. They thought that after the withdrawal of British troops, the Yishuv could not effectively resist the Arab forces without the support of the US. In this context, Elie Sasson, the director of the Arab section of [[Jewish Agency]], and several other personalities, persuaded David Ben-Gurion and [[Golda Meir|Golda Meyerson]] to advance a diplomatic initiative to the Arabs. The job of negotiation was delegated to Joshua Palmon, who was prohibited from limiting the Haganah's liberty of action but was authorized to declare that "the Jewish people were ready with a truce."&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logistical support of the Eastern Bloc===
In the context of the embargo imposed upon Palestinian belligerents—Jewish and Arab alike—and the dire lack of arms by the Yishuv in Palestine, Soviet ruler [[Joseph Stalin]]'s decision to breach the embargo and support the Yishuv with arms exported from [[Czechoslovakia]] played a role in the war that was differently appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:fr:Problématique du matériel lors de la guerre de Palestine de 1948|here]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Syria also bought arms from Czechoslovakia for the [[Arab Liberation Army]], but the shipment never arrived due to Haganah intervention.&lt;ref name="gelber2006p50"   /&gt;

Possible motivations for Stalin's decision include his support of the UN Partition plan, and allowing Czechoslovakia to earn some foreign income after being forced to refuse [[Marshall Plan]] assistance.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the motivation of Czech aid, see [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/receo_0035-1415_1974_num_5_1_1180 L'aide militaire tchèque à Israël, 1948] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5sZYh8K?url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/receo_0035-1415_1974_num_5_1_1180 |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of this support and the concrete role that it played is up for debate. Figures advanced by historians tend to vary. Yoav Gelber spoke of 'small deliveries from Czechoslovakia arriving by air [...] from April 1948 onwards'&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; whereas various historians have argued that there was an unbalanced level of support in favor of [[Yishuv]], given that the Palestinian Arabs did not benefit from an equivalent level of Soviet support.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the résumé of an article by [[Arnold Krammer]] [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/receo_0035-1415_1974_num_5_1_1180 L'aide militaire tchèque à Israël, 1948]. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5sZYh8K?url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/receo_0035-1415_1974_num_5_1_1180 |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the embargo that was extended to all Arab states in May 1948 by the UN Security Council caused great problems to them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/unres46.html 17 April 1948 resolution] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5sZj4fc?url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/unres46.html |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab leaders' refusal of direct involvement===
Arab leaders did what they possibly could to avoid being directly involved&lt;ref&gt;This term is important. Pappé underlined that they were not ready 'to have their own troops intervene' in the conflict, but that they would rather follow other solutions, such as delegating the task to a voluntary force, like the Arab Liberation Army, that they financed.&lt;/ref&gt;' in support for the Palestinian cause.&lt;ref&gt;[[#pappé|Ilan Pappé (2000)]], p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Arab League]] summit of October 1947, in [[Aley]], the Iraqi general, Ismail Safwat, painted a realist picture of the situation. He underlined the better organization and greater financial support of the Jewish people in comparison to the Palestinians. He recommended the immediate deployment of the Arab armies at the Palestinian borders, the dispatching of weapons and ammunition to the Palestinians, and the contribution of a million [[pound sterling|pounds]] of financial aid to them. His proposals were rejected, other than the suggestion to send financial support, which was not followed up on. Nonetheless, a techno-military committee was established to coordinate assistance to the Palestinians. Based in [[Cairo]], it was directed by Sawfat, who was supported by Lebanese and Syrian officers and representatives of the Higher Arab Committee. A Transjordian delegate was also appointed, but he did not participate in meetings.

At the December 1947 Cairo summit, under pressure by public opinion, the Arab leaders decided to create a military command that united all the heads of all the major Arab states, headed by Safwat. They still ignored his calls for financial and military aid, preferring to defer any decision until the end of the Mandate,&lt;ref name="Ilan Pappé 2000 p.147"&gt;[[#pappé|Ilan Pappé (2000)]], p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; but, nevertheless, decide to form the [[Arab Liberation Army]], which would go into action in the following weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 20–21 January 1948, around 700 armed Syrians entered Palestine via Transjordan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/d3bc8aaa0231aae0802564ad003974d2?OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=0,S%2FAgenda,270 UN Security Council 270th meeting report]   {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5sZqgoB?url=http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/d3bc8aaa0231aae0802564ad003974d2?OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=0%2CS%2FAgenda%2C270 |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1948, Safwat reiterated his demands, but they fell on deaf ears: the Arab governments hoped that the Palestinians, aided by the Arab Liberation Army, could manage on their own until the International community renounced the partition plan.&lt;ref name="Ilan Pappé 2000 p.147"/&gt;

==Arms problem==

===Civil war beginning (until 1 April 1948)===
[[File:Smg sten MK IIS 01.jpg|Right|thumb|[[Sten]] submachine gun]]
The [[Arab Liberation Army]] was, in theory, financed and equipped by the [[Arab League]]. A budget of one million pounds sterling had been promised to them,&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; due to the insistence of Ismail Safwat. In reality, though, funding never arrived, and only [[Syria]] truly supported the Arab volunteers in concrete terms. 
Syria bought from [[Czechoslovakia]] a quantity of arms for the [[Arab Liberation Army]] but the shipment never arrived due to Hagana force intervention.&lt;ref name="gelber2006p50"/&gt;

According to Lapierre &amp; Collins, on the ground, logistics were completely neglected, and their leader, Fawzi al-Qawuqji, envisaged that his troops survive only on the expenses accorded to them by the Palestinian population.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gelber says that the Arab League had arranged the supplies through special contractors.&lt;ref name="gelber2006p52"/&gt; They were equipped with different types of light weapons, light and medium-sized mortars, a number of 75&amp;nbsp;mm and 105&amp;nbsp;mm guns, and armoured vehicles but their stock of shells was small.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris (2008), p.90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gelber2006p13"/&gt;

The situation that the [[Army of the Holy War]] and the Palestinian forces were in was worse. They could not rely on any form of foreign support and had to get by on the funds that [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]] could raise. The troops' armament was limited to what the fighters already had. To make things even worse, they had to be content with arms bought on the [[black market]] or pillaged from British warehouses, and, as a result, did not really have enough arms to wage war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Until March, Haganah suffered also a lack of arms. The Jewish fighters benefitted from a number of clandestine factories that manufactured some light weapons,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.עמותת-חיל-החימוש.co.il/?section=217#_ftn19  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050411000000/http://www./ |date=11 April 2005 }} produced [[sten]] sub machine guns, 2" and 3" mortars and ammunition&lt;/ref&gt; ammunition and explosives. The one weapon of which there was no shortage was locally produced explosives.&lt;ref&gt;Dov Joseph, ''The Faithful City – The Siege of Jerusalem 1948''. Library of Congress number 60 10976. p. 8: "For example, all the land mines used against Rommel came from Jewish factories in Palestine."&lt;/ref&gt; However, they had far less than what was necessary to carry out a war: in November, only one out of every three Jewish combatants was armed, rising to two out of three within Palmach.&lt;ref&gt;[[#karsh|Efraïm Karsh (2002)]], p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hagana sent agents to Europe and to the United States, in order to arm and equip this army.
To finance all of this, [[Golda Meir]] managed, by the end of December, to collect $25&amp;nbsp;million through a fundraising campaign set about in the United States to capitalize on American sympathisers to the Zionist cause.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], Chap. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the 129&amp;nbsp;million US dollars raised between October 1947 and March 1949 for the Zionist cause, more than $78&amp;nbsp;million, over 60%, were used to buy arms and munition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris victims fr|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death toll and analysis===
In the last week of March alone, the losses sustained by Haganah were particularly heavy: they lost three large convoys in ambushes, more than 100 soldiers and their fleet of armoured vehicles.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.163"/&gt;

All in all, West Jerusalem was gradually 'choked;' the settlements of Galilee could not be reached in any other way but via the valley of [[Jordan]] and the road of [[Nahariya]].  This along with the foreseen attack of the Arab states in May and the earlier projected departure date of the British pushed Haganah to the offensive and to apply [[Plan Dalet]] from April onwards.

===Haganah on the offensive (1 April – 15 May 1948)===
A leased transport plane was used for the [[Operation Balak]] first arms ferry flight from [[Czechoslovakia]] on the end of March 1948. At the beginning of April 1948, a shipment of thousands of rifles and hundreds of machine guns arrived at Tel Aviv harbor. With this big shipment, the Hagana could supply weapons to a concentrated effort, without taking over the arms of other Jewish territory and risking them being with no weapons.&lt;ref name="morris2008p117"/&gt;  The Hagana went into the offensive, although still lacking heavy weapons.

===After 15 May 1948===
After the Arab states invasion at 15 May, during the first weeks of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the arms advantage leant in favour of the Arab states. From June, onwards, there was also a flow of heavy arms.
From June, after the first truce, the advantage leant clearly towards the Israelis. This situation's changing was due to the contacts made in November 1947 and afterwards.

The [[Yishuv]] purchased rifles, [[machine gun]]s and munitions from [[Czechoslovakia]],&lt;ref name="morris2008p117"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], et pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; which were mainly supplied after the British navy blockade was lifted on 15 May 1948, at the end of the British mandate.&lt;ref name="gelber2006p13"/&gt; The Yishuv obtained from [[Czechoslovakia]] a supply of [[Avia S-199]] fighter planes too&lt;ref&gt;Walid Khalidi, ''Before Their Diaspora'', Institute for Palestine Studies, Washington DC, 1991, p. 316 rapporté par [http://www.canpalnet-ottawa.org/canpalissafahel.html Issa Fahel by Gary D. Keenan] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5sZyNMk?url=http://www.canpalnet-ottawa.org/canpalissafahel.html |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, later on in the conflict, [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s. In the stockpiles left over from World War II, the [[Yishuv]] procured all the necessary equipment, vehicles and logistics needed for an army. In France, they procured armoured vehicles despite the ongoing embargo.&lt;ref&gt;[[#razoux|Pierre Razoux (2006)]], p.79 et p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yishuv]] bought machines to manufacture arms and munitions, forming the foundations of the Israeli armament industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], pp. 109–113&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yishuv]] bought at the United States, bombers and transport aircraft, which during [[Operation Balak]] were used to ferry arms and dismantled [[Avia S-199]] fighter planes from [[Czechoslovakia]] to [[Israel]], in defiance of the [[U.N]] embargo, for 3 months, starting at 12 May 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], pp. 375–376&lt;/ref&gt; Some ships were also leased out from various European ports so that these goods could be transported by 15 May.

However, for Ben-Gurion, the problem was also constructing an army that was worthy to be a state army.&lt;ref&gt;[[#razoux|Pierre Razoux (2006)]], pp. 96, 575&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reorganisation of Haganah==
[[File:Ordre de bataille Palestine avril 48.gif|right|thumb|Theatre of Operation of each Haganah brigade.]]
After 'having gotten the Jews of Palestine and of elsewhere to do everything that they could, personally and financially, to help [[Yishuv]],' Ben-Gurion's second greatest achievement was his having successfully transformed Haganah from being a clandestine [[paramilitary]] organization into a true army.&lt;ref&gt;[[#pappé|Ilan Pappé (2000)]], p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Ben-Gurion appointed [[Israel Galili]] to the position of head of the High Command counsel of Haganah and divided Haganah into 6 [[infantry]] brigades, numbered 1 to 6, allotting a precise theatre of operation to each one. Yaakov Dori was named Chief of Staff, but it was Yigael Yadin who assumed the responsibility on the ground as chief of Operations. Palmach, commanded by [[Yigal Allon]], was divided into 3 elite brigades, numbered 10–12, and constituted the mobile force of Haganah.&lt;ref&gt;[[#karsh|Efraïm Karsh (2002)]], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Ben-Gurion's attempts to retain personal control over the newly formed [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] lead later in July to [[The Generals' Revolt]].

On 19 November 1947, obligatory [[conscription]] was instituted for all men and women aged between 17 and 25. By end of March 21,000 people had been conscripted.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 23, 38. Gives the date of the call-up as 5 December.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#pappé|Ilan Pappé (2000)]], p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March the call-up was extended to men and single women aged between 26 and 35. Five days later a General Mobilization order was issued for all men under 40.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, pp. 32, 117.

"From November 1947, the Haganah, (...) began to change from a territorial militia into a regular army. (...) Few of the units had been well trained by December. (...) By March–April, it fielded still under-equipped battalion and brigades. By April–May, the Haganah was conducting brigade size offensive."&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of the roads and blockade of Jerusalem==

===Geographic situation of the Jewish zones===
[[File:Jewish zones 12147.PNG|thumb|Right|Map of Jewish settlements and roads in Palestine by 1 December 1947]]
Apart from on the coastline, Jewish [[yishuv]]im, or settlements, were very dispersed. Communication between the coastal area (the main area of Jewish settlements) and the peripheral settlements was by road. These road were an easy target for attacks, as most of them passed through or near entirely Arab localities. The isolation of the 100,000 Jewish people in [[Jerusalem]] and other Jewish settlements outside the coastal zone, such as kibbutz [[Kfar Etzion]], halfway on the strategic road between Jerusalem and [[Hebron]], the 27 settlements in the southern region of [[Negev]]&lt;ref name="Efraïm Karsh 2002 p.34"&gt;[[#karsh|Efraïm Karsh (2002)]], p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and the settlements to the north of [[Galilee]], were a strategic weakness for the Yishuv.

The possibility of evacuating these difficult to defend zones was considered, but the policy of [[Haganah]] was set by David Ben-Gurion. He stated that "what the Jewish people have has to be conserved. No Jewish person should abandon his or her house, farm, [[kibbutz]] or job without authorization. Every outpost, every colony, whether it is isolated or not, must be occupied as though it were [[Tel Aviv]] itself."&lt;ref name="Larry Collins 1971 p.163"/&gt; No Jewish settlement was evacuated until the invasion of May 1948. Only a dozen kibbutzim in Galilee, and those in Gush Etzion sent women and children into the safer interior zones.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben-Gurion gave instructions that the settlements of Negev be reinforced in number of men and goods,&lt;ref name="Efraïm Karsh 2002 p.34"/&gt; in particular the kibbutzim of [[Kfar Darom]] and [[Yad Mordechai]] (both close to [[Gaza City|Gaza]]), [[Revivim]] (south of [[Beersheba]]), and [[Kfar Etzion]]. Conscious of the danger that weighed upon Negev, the supreme command of [[Haganah]] assigned a whole [[Palmach]] battalion there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;
===Siege of Jerusalem===

{{Main article|Battle for Jerusalem (1948)}}

[[Siege of Jerusalem (1948)|Jerusalem]] and the great difficulty of accessing the city became even more critical to its Jewish population, who made up one sixth of the total Jewish population in Palestine. The long and difficult route from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, after leaving the Jewish zone at [[Khulda|Hulda]], went through the foothills of [[Latrun]]. The 28-kilometre route between [[Bab al-Wad]] and Jerusalem took no less than three hours,&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; and the route passed near the Arab villages of [[Saris]], [[Qalunya|Qaluniya]], [[Al-Qastal]], and [[Deir Yassin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] arrived in Jerusalem with the intent to surround and besiege its Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Surif]], a village to the southwest of Jerusalem, with his supporters—around a hundred fighters who were trained in [[Syria]] before the war and who served as officers in his army, [[Army of the Holy War|Jihad al-Muqadas]], or Army of the Holy War. He was joined by a hundred or so young villagers and Arab veterans of the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; His militia soon had several thousand men,&lt;ref&gt;[[#karsh|Efraïm Karsh (2002)]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and it moved its training quarters to [[Bir Zeit]], a town near [[Ramallah]]. 

Abd al-Qadir's zone of influence extended down to the area of [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Ramleh]], and the Judean Hills where [[Hasan Salama]] commanded 1,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;  Salama, like Abd al-Qadir, had been affiliated with Mufti Haj Amin al Husseini for years, and had also been a commander in the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], participated in the [[Rashid Ali]] coup of 1941 and the subsequent [[Anglo-Iraqi War]].&lt;ref name="Hirszowicz2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Łukasz Hirszowicz|title=The Third Reich and the Arab East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTV6DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT101|date=10 November 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-315-40939-9|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Salama had re-entered Palestine in 1944 in [[Operation Atlas (Mandatory Palestine)|Operation Atlas]], parachuting into the Jordan Valley as a member of a special German--Arab commando unit of the Waffen SS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nazi Palestine: The Plans for the Extermination of the Jews in Palestine|last=Mallmann|first=Klaus-Michael|author2=Martin Cüppers|others=Krista Smith (translator)|year=2010|publisher=Enigma Books|isbn=978-1-929631-93-3|page=200,201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He coordinated with al-Husayni to execute a plan of disruption and harassment of road traffic in an attempt to isolate and blockade Western (Jewish) Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.26"&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#karsh|Efraïm Karsh (2002)]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December, the first organized attack occurred when ten members of a convoy between [[Bethlehem]] and [[Kfar Etzion]] were killed.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.26"/&gt;

On 14 January, Abd al-Qadir himself commanded and took part in an attack against Kfar Etzion, in which 1,000 Palestinian Arab combatants were involved. The attack was a failure, and 200 of al-Husayni's men died. Nonetheless, the attack did not come without losses of Jewish lives: a detachment of [[Convoy of 35|35 Palmach men]] who sought to reinforce the establishment were ambushed and killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#karsh|Efraïm Karsh (2002)]], p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January, a Jewish convoy was attacked near the  Arab village of [[al-Qastal]].&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.27"/&gt; The attack went badly and several villages to the northeast of [[Jerusalem]] answered a call for assistance, although others did not, for fear of reprisals.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.27"&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign for control over the roads became increasingly militaristic in nature, and became a focal point of the Arab war effort.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.27"/&gt; After 22 March, supply convoys to Jerusalem stopped, due to a convoy of around thirty vehicles having been destroyed in the [[gorge]]s of Bab-el-Wad.&lt;ref name="Pierre Razoux 2006 p.66"&gt;[[#razoux|Pierre Razoux (2006)]], p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March, an important [[Gush Etzion Convoy|supply convoy]] from [[Kfar Etzion]] was taken in an ambush in south of Jerusalem. They were forced to surrender all of their arms, ammunition and vehicles to al-Husayni's forces. The Jews of Jerusalem requested the assistance of the United Kingdom after 24 hours of combat. According to a British report, the situation in Jerusalem, where a food rationing system was already in application, risked becoming desperate after 15 May.&lt;ref name="Efraïm Karsh 2002 p.40"&gt;[[#karsh|Efraïm Karsh (2002)]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation in other areas of the country was as critical as the one of Jerusalem. The settlements of Negev were utterly isolated, due to the impossibility of using the Southern coastal road, which passed through zones densely populated by Arabs.&lt;ref name="Efraïm Karsh 2002 p.40"/&gt; On 27 March, a convoy of supplies (the Yehiam convoy)&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.163"/&gt; that was intended for the isolated [[kibbutz]]im north-west of Galilee was attacked in the vicinity of [[Nahariya]]. In the ensuing battle, 42–47 [[Haganah]] combatants and around a hundred fighters of the [[Arab Liberation Army]] were killed, and all vehicles involved were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Pierre Razoux 2006 p.66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Efraïm Karsh 2002 p.40"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haganah offensive (1 April – 15 May 1948)==
The second phase of the war, which began in April, marked a huge change in direction, as Haganah moved to the offensive.

In this stage, Arab forces were composed of around 10,000 men among which between 3,000 and 5,000 foreign volunteers serving in the [[Arab Liberation Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris]], in the ''Birth revisited'', 2003, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoav Gelber]], ''Palestine 1948'', 2006, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilan Pappe]], ''The ethnic cleansing of Palestine'', 2006, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haganah]] and [[Palmach]] forces were steadily increasing. In March, they aligned around 15,000 men&lt;ref&gt;[[David Tal (historian)|David Tal]], ''War in Palestine 1948'', 2004, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; and in May around 30,000 who were better equipped, trained and organized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris]], in the ''Birth revisited'', 2003, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoav Gelber]], ''Palestine 1948'', 2006, p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilan Pappe]], ''The ethnic cleansing of Palestine'', 2006, p. 44 gives the number of 50,000 with 30,000 fighting forces.&lt;/ref&gt;

The armed Palestinian groups were roundly defeated, Yishuv took control of some of the principal routes that linked the Jewish settlements, and as a consequence, [[Jerusalem]] was able to receive supplies again. Palestinian society collapsed. Many mixed cities were taken by the Haganah as well as [[Jaffa]]. A massive exodus was triggered.

===Plan Dalet===
{{Main article|Plan Dalet}}
[[File:Dori and Yadin.JPG|thumb|Right|[[Yaakov Dori]], Haganah's Chief of Staff, and his right-hand man, [[Yigael Yadin]], Chief of Operations.]]
Plan Dalet was finalized on 10 March 1948, under the direction of [[Yigael Yadin]]. 75 pages long, it laid down the rules and the objects that were to be followed by Haganah during the second phase of the war. Its principal objective was to secure Yishuv's uninterrupted territorial connections, particularly in response to the war of the roads carried out by Al-Hussayni and in preparation for the Arab states' declared intervention. Plan Dalet caused quite a controversy among historians. Some see it as a plan that was primarily defensive and military in nature and a preparation against invasion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/pland.htm Plan D – Master Defense Plan of the Hagana] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5sa95dJ?url=http://www.mideastweb.org/pland.htm |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others think that the plan was offensive in nature and aimed at conquering as much of Palestine as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acj.org/w_khalidi.htm |title=Islam, the West, and Jerusalem |author=Walid Khalidi |date=5 June 1996 |publisher=American Committee on Jerusalem |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716172337/http://acj.org/w_khalidi.htm |archivedate=16 July 2006 |accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Nachshon (2–20 April)===
{{Main article|Operation Nachshon}}
[[File:Nachshon.GIF|thumb|right|Theatre of operations]]

[[File:Kastal.jpg|thumb|250px|Palestinian irregulars of the [[Holy War Army]], approaching [[Al Qastal, Palestine|al-Qastal]] village near Jerusalem to take it back from Palmach.]]
At the end of March 1948, Hussayni's troops prevented supply convoys from reaching Jerusalem. The city was besieged and the Jewish population was forced to adhere to a rationing system. Ben-Gurion decided to launch the operation Nachshon to open up the city and provide supplies to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; [[Operation Nachshon]] marked the [[Haganah]] shift to the offensive, even before launching [[plan D]].&lt;ref name="morris2008p116"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=1948: a history of the first Arab-Israeli war|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5jtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|page=116|quote="At the time, Ben-Gurion and the HGS believed that they had initiated a one-shot affair, albeit with the implication of a change of tactics and strategy on the Jerusalem front. In fact, they had set in motion a strategic transformation of Haganah policy. Nahshon heralded a shift from the defensive to the offensive and marked the beginning of the implementation of tochnit dalet (Plan D)—without Ben-Gurion or the HGS ever taking an in principle decision to embark on its implementation. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first orders were given on 2 April 1948 with diversion attacks including Qastel.&lt;ref&gt;Yoav Gelber 2006, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Between 5–20 April 1500 men from the Givati and Harel brigades took control of the road to Jerusalem&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed 3 or 4 convoys to reach the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris]] ([[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 236) speaks of 3 resupply convoys but Lapierre and Collins ([[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 456) speak of a fourth convoy of 300 lorries that left Kfar Biou on the dawn of 20 April.&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation was a military success. All the Arab villages that blocked the route were either taken or destroyed, and the Jewish forces were victorious in all their engagements. Nonetheless, not all the objectives of the operation were achieved, since only 1800 tonnes of the 3,000 envisaged were transported to the city, and two months of severe rationing had to be assumed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] was killed during the night of 7–8 April, in the midst of the battles taking place in [[Al-Qastal]]. The loss of this charismatic Palestinian leader 'disrupted the Arab strategy and organization in the area of Jerusalem.'&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 455&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, Emil Ghuri, changed tactics: instead of provoking a series of ambushes throughout the route, he had a huge road block erected at Bab al-Wad, and Jerusalem was once again isolated as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Nachshon exposed the poor military organization of the Palestinian paramilitary groups. Due to lack of logistics, particularly food and ammunition, they were incapable of maintaining engagements that were more than a few hours away from their permanent bases.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.89"&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with these events, the [[Arab Higher Committee]] asked Alan Cunningham to allow the return of the Mufti, the only person capable of redressing the situation. Despite obtaining permission, the Mufti did not get to Jerusalem. His declining prestige cleared the way for the expansion of the influence of the Arab Liberation Army and of [[Fawzi Al-Qawuqji]] in the Jerusalem area.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.89"/&gt;

===Battle of Mishmar HaEmek (4–15 April)===
[[File:Mishmar HaEmek.JPG|thumb|Right|Women training at [[Mishmar HaEmek]]]]
[[File:MishmarHaemek2.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish soldiers at the entry of the Mishmar Ha'emek, 1948]]
{{main article|Battle of Mishmar HaEmek}}
Mishmar HaEmek is a [[kibbutz]] that was founded by [[Mapam]] in 1930, in the [[Jezreel Valley]], close to the road between [[Haifa]] and [[Jenin]] that passes the [[Megiddo (kibbutz)|Megiddo kibbutz]]. It is situated in a place that [[Haganah]] officers considered to be on one of the most likely axes of penetration for a 'major Arab attack' against the Yishuv.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.240"&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April, the Arab Liberation Army launched an attack on the kibbutz with the support of artillery. The attack was fought off by the members of the kibbutz, who were supported by Haganah soldiers. The artillery fire that had almost totally destroyed the kibbutz was stopped by a British column, who arrived on the scene by order of General MacMillan, and, on 7 April, [[Fawzi Al-Qawuqji]] accepted a 24-hour [[ceasefire]], but required that the kibbutz be surrendered. The inhabitants of the kibbutz evacuated their children, and, after having consulted Tel Aviv, refused to surrender.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.240"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 or 9 April, Haganah prepared a counter-offensive. [[Yitzhak Sadeh]] was put in charge of operations, with the order to 'clean out' the region. The battle lasted until 15 April. Sadeh's men besieged all the villages around the kibbutz, and the [[Arab Liberation Army]] had to retreat to its bases in Jabba. The majority of the inhabitants of the region fled, but those who did not were either imprisoned or expelled to Jenin. The villages were plundered by some [[kibbutz]]nikim and razed to the ground with explosives  with accordance to Plan Dalet&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 pp.242-243"&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 242–243&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], ''The destruction of the Arab villages'', pp. 342-360.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Benny Morris|Morris]], the Arab Liberation Army soldiers were demoralized by reports of the [[Deir Yassin massacre]] and the death of [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]]. Throughout battle, they had generally been forced to withdraw and to abandon the people of the villages.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.242"&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dominique Lapierre]] and [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]] report that [[Joshua Palmon]], head of a unit of 6 men, failed to seize invaluable pieces of artillery, and they depict the events{{Clarify|pre-text=?|date=July 2013}} as a débâcle for which [[Fawzi Al-Qawuqji]] offered extravagant excuses, declaring in particular that the Jewish forces has 120 tanks, six squadrons of fighter and bomber aircraft and that they were supported by a regiment of [[gentile]] Russian volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morris, "according to Ben-Gurion, some 640 Haganah soldiers had faced about twenty-five hundred ALA troops, with superior firepower—and bested them".&lt;ref name="gelber2006p136"/&gt; When the battle finished, [[Palmach]] forces continued 'cleaning' operations until 19 April, destroying several villages and forcing those who inhabited them to flee. Some villages were also evacuated under the instruction of Arab authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 243–244&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, [[Irgun]] engaged in several operations in the region, razing a number of villages and killing some of their inhabitants, as did some detachments from the Golani and Alexandroni brigades.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.244"&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deir Yassin massacre===
{{Main article|Deir Yassin massacre}}

[[Deir Yassin]] is a village located 5&amp;nbsp;kilometres west of Jerusalem. On 9 April 1948, independently of operation Nachshon, around 120 [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] men attacked the village. They massacred between 100 and 120 inhabitants of the village, mostly civilians.&lt;ref name=GelberAppendix&gt;Yoav Gelber, ''Palestine 1948'', [http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~censor/katz-directory/05-12-14gelber-palestine-1948-appendix-II-what-happened-in-deir-ypssin-english.pdf Appendix II]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Haganah had approved the attack and assisted in it, but was not involved in the massacre.&lt;ref name=GelberAppendix/&gt;

The massacre led to indignation from the international community, the more so since the press of the time reported that the death toll was 254. Ben-Gurion roundly condemned it,&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; as did the principal Jewish authorities: the [[Haganah]], the Great Rabbinate and the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], who sent a letter of condemnation, apology and condolence to King [[Abdullah I of Jordan]].&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.239"&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Benny Morris|Morris]], "the most important immediate effect of the atrocity and the media campaign that followed it was how one started to report the fear felt in Palestinian towns and villages, and, later, the panicked fleeing from them."&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.239"/&gt; Another important repercussion was within the Arab population of neighbouring Arab states, which, once again, increased its pressure on the representatives of these states to intervene and come to the aid of the Palestinian Arabs.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.239"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadassah medical convoy massacre===
{{Main article|Hadassah medical convoy massacre}}

On 13 April, partly in revenge for the Deir Yassin massacre, a [[Hadassah medical convoy massacre|convoy that was driving towards Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital]] on Mount Scopus was attacked by hundreds of Arabs. In the seven-hour battle 79 Jews were killed including doctors and patients.&lt;ref name="gelber2006p50"/&gt; Thirteen British soldiers were present, but they stood by, only putting in a perfunctory attempt at intervention in the last moments of the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], pp. 429–442&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant-Colonel [[Jack Churchill]] was present at the scene, and later testified that he had attempted to assist the Hadassah convoy by radioing for support, only for the request to be turned down.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barr Smith, ''Fighting Jack Churchill Survived: A Wartime Odyssey Beyond Compare'' World War Two History, Profiles Column, July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Ramat Yohanan and the defection of the Druze===
Following the 'fiasco'&lt;ref&gt;This word is from [[Yoav Gelber]] ([[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 93)&lt;/ref&gt; of Mishmar HaEmek, Fawzi Al-Qawuqji ordered the [[Druze]] regiment of the [[Arab Liberation Army]] into action, to carry out diversion operations. Druze soldiers took position in several Arab villages 12&amp;nbsp;kilometres to the east of Haifa,&lt;ref&gt;Shafa 'Amr, Khirbet Kasayir et Hawsha&lt;/ref&gt; whence they occasionally attacked traffic and Jewish settlements, including [[Ramat Yohanan]].&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.244"/&gt;

The Kibbutznikim and the Haganah soldiers that supported them forced back their attacks and razed the villages from which they launched their attacks. Having run out of ammunition, the Druze withdrew to their base in [[Shefa-'Amr]], with one hundred casualties.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.93"&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial failure, a battalion-sized Carmeli force on the night of 15–16 April overran the two villages. The Druze Battalion, on 16 April assaulted the Carmeli positions nine times but the Carmeli troops fought back. By afternoon, the exhausted Druze troops retreated. An Haganah report praised "the well trained and very brave enemy forces."&lt;ref name="Morris2008p137"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=1948: a history of the first Arab-Israeli war|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5jtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Druze had already made contact on several occasions with Yishuv agents and following their defeat at Ramat Yohanan, the Druze officers offered to defect and to join the ranks of Haganah. This proposition was discussed with [[Yigael Yadin]], who refused the proposal but suggested that they could help to carry out sabotage operations behind the backs of the Arabs and to influence their comrades into deserting the army. By the start of May, 212 Wahab soldiers deserted. Taking into account the attitude of his men, Wahab met with Jewish liaison officers on 9 May and agreed to cooperate with Haganah. The two parties avoided clashes, and Wahab created a neutral enclave in the centre of [[Galilee]]. Wahab's army did not respond to calls for it to help fight Haganah's occupation of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], and avoided being present while Haganah occupied the police fortress of Shefa-'Amr during its evacuation by the British.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.93"/&gt;

The position that the Druze took influenced their fate after the war. Given the good relationship between the Druze and Yishuv from 1930 onwards despite their collaboration with the Arab Higher Council and the [[Arab League]], Ben-Gurion insisted that the Druze, as well as the [[Circassians]] and the [[Maronites]] benefit from a different position to that of the other Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], pp. 225–226&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siege of mixed localities===
In the context of Plan Dalet{{Citation needed|reason=might be wrong|date=October 2013}}, mixed urban centres, or those on the borders of the Jewish state, were attacked and besieged by Jewish forces. [[Tiberias]] was attacked on 10 April and fell six days later; [[Haifa]] fell on 23 April, after only one day of combat ([[Operation Bi'ur Hametz]]), and [[Jaffa]] was attacked on 27 April but fell only after the British abandoned it ([[Operation Hametz]]). [[Safed]] and [[Beisan]] ([[Operation Gideon]]) fell on 11 May and 13 May respectively, within the framework of Operation Yitfah, and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] fell on 17 May, within the framework of Operation Ben-Ami.

The Arab inhabitants of these towns fled or were expelled en masse. In these 6 cities, only 13,000 of the total of 177,000 Arab inhabitants remained by the end of May. This phenomenon ricocheted also in the suburbs and the majority of the zone's Arab villages.

===Operation Yiftah (20 April – 24 May)===
{{Main article|Operation Yiftach}}
[[File:Yiftah.GIF|thumb|right|Theatre of operations]] [[Galilee Panhandle]], a zone in northeastern [[Galilee]], between the [[Sea of Galilee|Lake Tiberias]] and [[Metula]], was the Jewish-controlled area that was the most distant and isolated from the area most densely populated by Jews, the coastal plain. The presence of the Lebanese border to the north, the Syrian border to east and the Arab presence in the rest of Galilee made it a probable target for intervention of the Arab armies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006), pp. 134–135]]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the framework of the Dalet plan, [[Yigael Yadin]] entrusted [[Yigal Allon]], commander of the [[Palmach]], with the responsibility of managing Operation Yiftah, whose objectives were to control all the aforementioned area and consolidate it ahead of the Arab attack that was planned for 15 May.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003), p. 248]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allon was in charge the 1st and 3rd Palmach [[battalion]]s, which had to face the populace of [[Safed]] and several dozen Arab villages. The situation was made more problematic by the presence of the British, although they began their evacuation of the area. According to his analysis, it was essential that they empty the zone of any Arab presence to completely protect themselves; the exodus would also encumber the roads that the Arab forces would have to penetrate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 248–250&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April, Allon launched a campaign that mixed propaganda, attacks, seizing control of strongholds that the British had abandoned, and destroying conquered Arab villages. On 1 May, a counter-offensive was launched by Arab militiamen against Jewish settlements but was ultimately unsuccessful. On 11 May, [[Safed]] fell, and the operation finished on 24 May after the villages of the valley of Hula were burnt down. Syrian forces' planned offensive in the area failed and, by the end of June, Galilee panhandle from Tiberias to Metula, incorporating Safed, was emptied of all its Arab population.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 249–252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting of Golda Meir and King Abdullah I of Jordan (10 May)===
[[File:Golda Meir 1943.jpg|right|thumb|Golda Meir in 1943]]
On 10 May, [[Golda Meir]] and Ezra Danin secretly went to [[Amman]], to the palace of King Abdullah to discuss the situation with him. The situation that Abdullah found himself in was difficult. On one hand, his personal ambitions, the promises made by the [[Yishuv]] in November 1947{{Citation needed|reason=which promise?|date=July 2013}} and the British approval of these promises pushed him to consider annexing the Arab part of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] without intervening against the future state of Israel. On the other hand, the pressure exerted by his people in reaction to the massacre of Deir Yassin, combined with their feelings with regard to the Palestinian exodus and his agreements with other members of the [[Arab League]] pushed him to be more strongly involved in the war against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#pappé|Ilan Pappé (2000)]], p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; He also found himself in a position of power, having the benefit of military support from not only the Arab League, but the British. In his diary, Ben-Gurion wrote about Golda Meir's reaction to the meeting:

{{quote|We met [on 10 May] amicably. He was very worried and looks terrible. He did not deny that there had been talk and understanding between us about a desirable arrangement, namely that he would take the Arab part [of Palestine]. (...) But Abdullah had said that he could now, on 10 May, only offer the Jews "autonomy" within an enlarged Hashemite kingdom. He added that while he was not interested in invading the areas allocated for Jewish statehood, the situation was volatile. But he voiced the hope that Jordan and the Yishuv would conclude a peace agreement once the dust had settled.&lt;ref&gt;''War Diary 1948–1949'', ed. Elhanan Orren and Gershon Rivlin, Israël Defence Ministry Press, Tel Aviv, 1982, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historical analyses of the motivations and conclusions of this meeting differ. According to Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins – as well as Israeli [[historiography|historiographers]]{{who|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], pp. 525–530&lt;/ref&gt; – the intention behind the Yishuv's negotiation was to obtain a peace treaty and avoid an attack by Arab forces. At that time, the balance of power was not favourable for them, but Meir did not manage to convince the King.
[[File:Kingabdullahbinhussein.jpg|right|thumb|King Abdullah of Jordan]]

According to Morris,&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris victims fr|Benny Morris (1881)]], p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Abdullah 'reconsidered the promises that he made in November to not be opposed to the partition plan,' but left Meir with the impression that he would make peace with the Jewish state once the civil war had finished.

Avi Shlaim&lt;ref name="Henry Laurens 2005 p.83"/&gt; spoke of a 'tacit' agreement to prevent the division of Palestine with the Palestinians, arguing the idea that there was a collusion between the Hashemite Kingdom and Yishuv. The historian [[Yoav Gelber]], however, rejected this idea and devoted an entire work to dismounting it.&lt;ref&gt;Both theses are developed in [[Avi Shlaim]], ''Collusion Across the Jordan: King Abdullah, the Zionist movement and the Partition of Palestine'', Columbia University Press, 1988 and in [[Yoav Gelber]], ''Israeli-Jordanian dialogue, 1948–1953: cooperation, conspiracy or collusion'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Razoux indicated that 'the majority of experts consider it probable'{{Better source|reason=is this an objective sources for this. it is probably a mistake|date=July 2013}} that Ben-Gurion and King Abdullah had an understanding over dividing Palestine, and that only the pressure from the Arab states on Abdullah constrained him from following up on his promise. According to Razoux, this idea explains the attitude of the British, who, following this plan, would thereby fulfill the promises made by [[Arthur Balfour]] to the Yishuv and the Hashemite empire at the same time. He states that the presence of Arab Legion troops, before 15 May, near strategic positions held by the British is in this way easy to understand.&lt;ref&gt;[[#razoux|Pierre Razoux (2006)]], p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilan Pappé&lt;ref&gt;[[#pappé|Ilan Pappé (2000)]], pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; stressed that neither Abdullah's ministers, nor the Arab world itself, seemed to be privy to the discussions held between him and the Yishuv, even if his ambitions on Palestine were widely known. He also stated that Sir [[Alec Kirkbride]] and [[John Bagot Glubb|Glubb Pasha]] thought at the time that, at the very least, [[Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam|Azzam Pasha]], the Secretary of the Arab League, must have known about Abdullah's double game.

It is certain, on the other hand, that Golda Meir and King Abdullah did not come to an agreement on the status of Jerusalem. On 13 May, the Arab Legion took [[Kfar Etzion]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#karsh|Efraïm Karsh (2002)]], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; strategically located halfway along the road between Hebron and Jerusalem. On 17 May, Abdullah ordered [[John Bagot Glubb|Glubb Pasha]], commander of the Arab Legion, to launch an attack against the Holy City.

===Kfar Etzion massacre===
{{Main article|Kfar Etzion massacre}}
[[File:Gush Etzion.GIF|thumb|right|Theatre of operations]]
[[File:Etzion Tal Prisoners.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish prisoners taken after the fall of [[Gush Etzion]]]]

Kfar Etzion is a group of four settlements established on the strategic route between Hebron and Jerusalem, right in the middle of Arab inhabited territory. It had 400 inhabitants at the end of 1947. After the adoption of Resolution 181(II), it was the object of Arab attacks. Ben-Gurion reinforced it on 7 December, protecting it with a Palmach division, but on 8 January, he authorized the evacuation of the women and children of the settlements.

After 26 March, the last date on which a [[Gush Etzion Convoy#27 March 1948|supply convoy]] successfully reached it, despite heavy losses of life, the defenders were completely isolated.

On 12 May, [[Arab Legion]] units started to attack the settlements. The motivations advanced include their desire to protect one of their last supply convoys before the embargo took effect, which had to travel down the road by Kfar Etzion. Another theory is that the block of settlements obstructed the deployment of the Legion in the area around Hebron, whose attack was one of Abdullah's principal objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; External defences fell quickly, and, on 13 May, the first kibbutz was captured, and those who were taken prisoner were massacred; only four survived.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.96"&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfar-etzion.co.il/History/tabid/228/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/9/PageID/57/History-of-the-Etzion-Bloc1.aspx Official site of the kibbutz] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5sbSwb5?url=http://www.kfar-etzion.co.il/History/tabid/228/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/9/PageID/57/History-of-the-Etzion-Bloc1.aspx |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 131 defenders, 127, including 21 women, were killed, or massacred after they surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris]], ''The road to Jerusalem'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The other three establishments surrendered, and the kibbutzim were first plundered, then razed to the ground. In March 1949 320 prisoners from the Etzion settlements were released from the "Jordan POW camp at Mafrak", including 85 women.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Dayan, 'The Story of My Life'. {{ISBN|0-688-03076-9}}. Page 130. Out of a total of 670 prisoners released.&lt;/ref&gt;

The events that took place at Kfar Etzion made apparent the limitations of the policy prohibiting evacuation. Although it was effective during civil war, when facing militias, isolated Jewish settlements could not resist the firepower of a regular army, and an evacuation could have made it possible to avoid the captivity or death of those who defended the settlements.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.96"/&gt;

According to Yoav Gelber, the fall and massacre of Kfar Etzion influenced Ben-Gurion's decision to engage the Arab Legion on its way to Jerusalem, although the Haganah General Staff were divided about whether the Legion should be challenged inside Jerusalem itself as such a move could harm the Jews in the city. Ben-Gurion left the final decision to Shaltiel. The battle for Jerusalem was thus set in motion.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.96"/&gt;

===Jerusalem: Operations Yevusi and Kilshon ("Pitchfork") (13–18 May)===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 20755 The Palmach.jpg|thumb|[[Palmach]] soldiers attack the San Simon monastery in Katamon, Jerusalem, April 1948 (battle reconstruction)]]
[[File:Bevingrad.jpg|thumb|Bevingrad, centre of the British security zone in Jerusalem]]

{{Main article|Operation Yevusi}}
{{Main article|Operation Kilshon}}
[[Operation Yevusi]] lasted two weeks, from 22 April 1948 to 3 May 1948. Not all objectives were achieved before the British enforced a cease-fire. A [[Palmach]] force occupied the strategically located San Simon monastery in [[Katamon]]. Arab irregulars attacked the monastery and a heavy battle evolved. Both sides had a lot of wounded and killed fighters. The [[Palmach]] considered a retreat while the wounded fighters would blow themselves up, but then it was realized that the Arab force was exhausted and could not continue the fighting. As a result, the Arab residents left the suburb and the southern besieged Jewish suburbs were released.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris_1948|Benni Morris (2008)]], p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Haganah]] intended to capture the Old City during the final days of the Mandate.&lt;ref name=morrisglubb&gt;[[#morrisglubb|Benny Morris (2002)]], pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; Its attacks on the seam between East and West Jerusalem from 13–18 May (known as Operation Kilshon) were planned as the initial phase of this conquest.&lt;ref name=morrisglubb/&gt;

In [[Jerusalem]], the British held several strategically located security zones named "Bevingrads", at its centre. The city's radio station, telephone exchange and government hospital were located there, along with a number of barracks and the Notre Dame hostel, which dominated the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 576&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main objectives of Operation Kilshon was to take control of these zones of strategic importance while the British withdrew. On 13 May the Haganah extended its control of the Old City's Jewish Quarter and on 14th (having obtained the precise schedule of the evacuation with British complicity) took control of the Bevingrads, including the central post office and the Russian Church compound at 04:00.&lt;ref name=morrisglubb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], pp. 580–582&lt;/ref&gt; They surprised the Arab troops, who offered no resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], pp. 575–576&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary objective of Operation Kilshon was to simultaneously create a continuous frontline between the various isolated Jewish localities. For this aim, Brigadier General David Shaltiel, Haganah's former envoy to Europe, was deployed along with a troop of 400 Haganah soldiers and 600 militia soldiers. Emil Ghuri, the new leader of the Army of the Holy War, also envisaged taking these districts and mobilized 600 soldiers for the mission, but prepared no specific operation.

The secondary aim was also successful. In the North of the city, Jewish forces seized Arab-populated Sheikh Jarrah, made a connection with [[Mount Scopus]], and took the villages surrounding the American colony.&lt;ref name=morrisglubb/&gt; In the South, they ensured the connection of the German and Greek colonies with Talpiot and Ramat Rahel, after having taken the Allenby barracks. A Palmach unit even re-established contact with the Jewish district in the Old City via the [[Zion Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;According to this [http://daat.ac.il/daat/english/history/lapidot/27.htm Israeli site] with confirmation from this map [http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/MAPS/images/jer_maps/UNPartition.html from the Passia organization] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5scHNjN?url=http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/MAPS/images/jer_maps/UNPartition.html |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The irregular Arabic forces were rendered impotent and yielded to panic, calling the situation hopeless and announcing the imminent fall of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the framework of [[Plan Dalet]], [[Yigael Yadin]] intended to make a breakthrough in the west of [[Galilee]], wherein a number of isolated Jewish settlements were situated. This zone, which covers the land from [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] all the way to the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[border]], was allocated to the Arabs by the Partition plan, but was on the road through which Lebanese forces intended to enter into Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], pp. 134–135 Although the last (the Lebanese) ultimately would not engage in combat&lt;/ref&gt;

The command of this operation was entrusted to Moshe Carmel, head of the Carmeli brigade. It consisted of two phases: the first began on the evening of 13 May, when a column of Haganah's armoured vehicles and lorries advanced along the coast with no resistance. The forces of the Arab Liberation Army fled without entering battle, and the first phase of the operation finished when Acre was taken on 18 May. In the second phase, from 19 May to 21 May, troops went as far as the Yehi'am kibbutz by the Lebanese border, connecting it and conquering and destroying a number of Arab villages on the way.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 pp.252"&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp. 252–254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main wave of the Palestinian Arab exodus===
{{Main article|1948 Palestinian exodus|Causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus}}

[[File:Palestinian refugees.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Palestinian Arab refugees in 1948]]

Haganah's move to offensive operations during the second phase of the war was accompanied by a huge exodus that involved 350,000 Arab refugees, adding to the 100,000 displaced during the First wave. The term 'Palestinian exodus' is often used to refer to both these and two subsequent waves. These two waves gained a considerable amount of press interest and were widely relayed in the press of the time, more so than most other Palestine-related events.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, in ''The New York Times'' archives: [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nytimes/96593062.html?did=96593062&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=AI&amp;date=May%203%2C%201948&amp;author=&amp;pub=New%20York%20Times%20%20(1857-Current%20file)&amp;desc=DESPAIR%20IS%20VOICED%20BY%20ARAB%20REFUGEES : Despair is voiced by Arab refugees] {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of and responsibility for this exodus are highly controversial topics among commentators on the conflict and even historians who specialize in this era. Among the various possible causes, Efraim Karsh attributes the exodus mainly to Arab authorities' instructions to escape,&lt;ref name="KarshEssential"&gt;[[Efraim Karsh|Karsh, Efraim]], ''The Arab-Israeli Conflict: The Palestine War 1948''. Osprey Publishing, 2002, pp. 87–92&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others argue that a policy of expulsion had been organized by the [[Yishuv]] authorities and implemented by Haganah.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilan Pappe]], ''The Ethnic cleansing of Palestine'', pp. xii–xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Others yet reject these two assumptions and see the exodus as the cumulative effect of all the civil war's consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris]], ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', Oxford University Press, 2004, Conclusions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparations made by the Arab League===
During the last meeting of the Arab League in February 1948, the Arab leaders expressed their convictions in the capacity of the [[Arab Liberation Army]] to help the Palestinians and to force the international community to give up on the UN-backed partition plan.&lt;ref name="Ilan Pappé 2000 p.147"/&gt; The following summit took place in Cairo on 10 April, with the situation having clearly developed with the death of Al-Hussayni and the debacle at Mishmar Ha'emek.

Once again, Ismail Safwat called for the immediate deployment of the Arab state armies at the borders of Palestine, and for the need to go beyond the established policy of participating in little more than small-scale raids towards taking part in large-scale operations. For the first time, the Arab leaders discussed the possibility of intervening in Palestine.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.120"&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] declared themselves ready to intervene immediately, but King Abdullah refused to let the [[Arab Legion]] forces intervene immediately in favour of the Palestinians, a move which irritated the [[Secretary-General]] of the League, who declared that Abdallah only cedes to the British diktat.

Nonetheless, Abdullah declared himself ready to send the Legion to assist the Palestinian cause after 15 May. In response, Syria insisted that the Egyptian army also take part, and, in spite of the opposition of Egypt's prime minister, [[King Farouk]] responded favourably to the Syrian request, but due to his aim of curbing the [[Jordan|Jordanians']] hegemonic goals rather than his desire to help the Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 p.120"/&gt;

Later on, following the visit of several Palestinian dignitaries in [[Amman]], and despite the opposition of Syria and the Mufti, Haj Amin al-Husseini, Azzam Pasha accepted Abdullah's proposition and sent Ismail Safwat to [[Amman]] to organize a coordination between the [[Arab Liberation Army]] and Jordan's Arab Legion. It was decided that command over the operations would be reserved for King Abdullah, and that the Iraqis would deploy a brigade in Transjordan to prepare for intervention on 15 May.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April, the 'intention to occupy Palestine' was officially announced at the Transjordanian parliament and the Jewish people were 'invited to place themselves beneath King Abdullah's jurisdiction.' The intention to spare their lives was also promised. Yishuv perceived this declaration as being one of war and encourages the Western world to pressure the King, through diplomatic means, to prevent his intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April, Jordanians, Egyptians and Iraqis disputed the command of Abdullah. Abdullah received the honorary title of [[Commander-in-Chief]], while the Iraqi general, Aldine Nur Mahmud, was named Chief of Staff. Despite this show of unity, it was agreed that each army would act independent of each other in the theatre of operations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May, the Iraqi task force arrived at [[Mafraq]]. It was composed of a regiment of armoured tanks, a regiment of mechanized infantry, and twenty-four artillery weapons, and included 1500 men.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians formed two brigades, deploying around 700 men into the [[Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrians could not put together a better force, whereas the Lebanese announced that they could not take part in military operations on 10 May.

It was only two days before, on 8 May, that the British Foreign Office was certain of the Arab invasion. Whereas British analysts considered that all Arab armies, except the Arab Legion, were not prepared for the engagements to come,&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], pp. 126, 132&lt;/ref&gt; the Egyptian officers claimed that their advance would be 'a parade with the least risk,' and that their army 'would be in Tel Aviv after just two weeks.'

The state of preparation of the army was such that they did not even have maps of Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], pp. 453–454&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the final plans of invasion had not even been established yet. British leaders tried in vain to make the Arab leaders reconsider their decision,&lt;ref&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; and Ismail Safwat resigned in indifference, but the Arab states seemed resolute. On 15 May 1948, the [[Arab League]] announced officially that it would intervene in Palestine to guarantee the security and right to self-determination of the inhabitants of Palestine in an independent state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/arab_invasion.html Arab League Declaration, 15 May 1948] from jewishvirtuallibrary.com. Retrieved 26 September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v5scvum7?url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/arab_invasion.html |date=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results and aftermath==
[[File:Zones controlled by Yishuv by the 20may48.GIF|thumb|right|Zones controlled by Yishuv by 20 May 1948, with comparison to zones held some five months earlier.]]

According to [[Benny Morris]], the result of these five and a half months of fighting was a "decisive Jewish victory". On one side, the "Palestinian Arab military power was crushed" and most of the population in the combat zones was fleeing or had been driven out. On the other side, the "Haganah transformed from a militia into an army" and succeeded "in consolidating its hold on a continuous strip of territory embracing the Coastal Plain, the Jezreel Valley, and the Jordan Valley." The Yishuv proved it had the capability to defend itself, persuading the United States and the remainder of the world to support it and the "victory over the Palestinian Arabs gave the Haganah the experience and self-confidence [...] to confront [...] the invading armies of the Arab states."&lt;ref name = "Morris_1948_p179"&gt;[[Benny Morris]], ''1948'', p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Yoav Gelber]], during the six weeks between the Haganah offensive on 1 April and the invasion of the Arab armies, the Arabs were defeated in almost every front. The Jewish forces captured four cities ([[Tiberias]], [[Jaffa]], [[Safed]], and [[Haifa]]) and 190 villages; most of their residents fled. The refugees flooded [[Samaria]], central [[Galilee]], [[Mount Hebron]] region, [[Gaza City|Gaza]] region, as well as [[Jordan|Transjordan]], [[Lebanon]], and southern [[Syria]]. With the defeat of the Palestinian forces and the ALA, the Arab League saw no other option than to invade at the end of the British Mandate. The process of deciding to invade and preparing for the attack began two or three weeks before the end of the Mandate, when the level of the defeat was revealed and it was clear the ALA could not prevent it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#gelber2004|Yoav Gelber (2004)]] p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Haganah was a poorly armed ragtag militia, its offensive of the last weeks went well, because Arab villages did not come to the help of their neighboring Arab villages or towns. Moreover, only a few young Arab men from untouched areas (e.g. Nablus, Hebron) participated in the fighting in Jerusalem, Haifa, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2008 p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anwar Nusseibeh]], a supporter of the Mufti, said the Mufti refused to issue arms to anyone except his political supporters and only recruited his supporters for the forces of the [[Holy War Army]]. This partially accounts for the absence of an organized Arab force and for the insufficient amount of arms, which plagued the Arab defenders of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Battle for Jerusalem in the Memoirs of Anwar Nusseibeh|url=http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/ViewArticle.aspx?id=200|publisher=Jerusalem Quarterly File, 11-12, 2001|author=Musa Budeiri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion, on behalf of the Jewish leadership, ''declared the establishment of a Jewish state in [[Eretz Israel]], to be known as the [[State of Israel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs: ''Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel: 14 May 1948''.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321213130/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%2BProcess/Guide%2Bto%2Bthe%2BPeace%2BProcess/Declaration%2Bof%2BEstablishment%2Bof%2BState%2Bof%2BIsrael.htm |date=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1948 Palestine war]] entered its second phase with the intervention of the Arab state armies and the beginning of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].

&lt;ref name="morris2008p117"&gt;Morris,2008, p.117, "The first shipment—of two hundred rifles, forty MG-34 machine guns, and 160,000 bullets—secretly landed during the night of 31 March–1 April at a makeshift airfield at Beit Daras in a chartered US Skymaster cargo plane.29 A second and far larger shipment, covered with onions and potatoes— of forty-five hundred rifles and two hundred machine guns, along with five million bullets—arrived at Tel Aviv port aboard the Nora on 2 April. (A third shipment—consisting of ten thousand rifles, 1,415 machine guns, and sixteen million rounds— reached the Yishuv by sea on 28 April.) Before this, the Haganah high command had had to "borrow" weapons from local units for a day or two for specific operations, and the units (and settlements) were generally reluctant to part with weapons, quite reasonably arguing that the Arabs might attack while the weapons were on loan. Now, at last, the Haganah command had at hand a stockpile of thousands of weapons that it could freely deploy. The two shipments proved decisive. As Ben-Gurion put it at the time, "After we have received a small amount of the [Czech] equipment . . . the situation is radically different in our favor." Without doubt, of all the shipments that subsequently reached the Yishuv, none was to have greater immediate impact or historical significance."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A. Monem Mahjoub''' (born May 4, 1963) is a Libyan linguist, philosopher, poet, historian, and political critic.&lt;ref name="lecourrierdumaghrebetdelorient"&gt;{{cite web| author=Nassir al-Sayeid al-Nour |title= Islamic Anticlericalism Manifesto |url=http://lecourrierdumaghrebetdelorient.info/art-culture/art-culture-islamic-anticlericalism-manifesto/|website=Lecourrierdumaghrebetdelorient.info|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes described as "the last Sumerian",&lt;ref&gt;Walid Zribi, ed. (2016) ''Back to Sumer'', Arabesques Books, Tunisia. p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; his major works are in the fields of linguistics, philology, historiography, religion and humanistic thought, civilization development and politics. As a prolific author he has written more than twenty five books.&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mahjoubinfo.wordpress.com/%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8/|website=Mahjoubinfo.wordpress.com|title=كتب &amp;#124; عبدالمنعم المحجوب - A. Monem Mahjoub|accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahjoub was born in the Libyan town of [[Sorman]], located east of the archaeological site of the city of [[Sabratha]].&lt;ref&gt;Walid Zribi (2009). ''The Last Sumerian''. TCP, Tunisia. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; As a youngster he was attracted by the residual remnants of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Phoenicia]]n civilizations. In this time, he documented those moments in a large photo collection. Having completed his primary education, he moved to study Industrial Management at [[George Brown College]] in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] where he studied for two years. He received a Master of [[Philosophy]] degree at Hassan University in [[Morocco]]. His Ph.D thesis under the title of Culture and Communication arts Theory in 1999.

==Theory of Sumerian roots== 
Mahjoub argues that he continues to amend an academic percept in the fields of [[linguistics]] has been lasted since the late nineteenth century, related to the [[Sumerian language]], which originated in the shores of [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]] in the 4th millennium B.C.  Mahjoub dismisses the idea that Sumerian was an isolated language and that its influence did not extend to the formulation of the world,{{clarify|date=August 2018}} especially [[Afroasiatic languages]]. He published his tour de force work ''Pre-language, Sumerian roots of Arabic and AfroAsiatic languages'',&lt;ref name="al-ilmiyah1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-ilmiyah.com/bookpage/9782745178497.html |title=ما قبل اللغة (الجذور السومرية للغة العربية واللغات الآفروآسيوية) |website=Al-ilmiyah.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting Afroasiology as a new coded term in the field of [[historical linguistics]], claiming that Sumerian is the embryonic stage of the  Afroasiatic languages, including [[Arabic]].
[[File:Afroasiatic progression.jpg|thumb|Afroasiatic progression]]

Mahjoub has endeavoured{{clarify|date=August 2018}} through books issued later to support the theoretical hypothesis demonstrated in his ''Pre-language''. He tracked and memorized [[phonetic change]]s that overlapped the [[Afroasiatic languages]], by comparing [[Sumer]]ian, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Arabic]] and ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]. He concluded that the Sumerian and Akkadian superposition is more than borrowed vocabulary, popularized as a result of the representation of the two languages in the same [[cuneiform writing]], but that the Sumerian [[syllable]]s are an embedded [[substratum]] in Akkadian and Arabic. He has also concluded that there are Afroasiatic arrays descended from the Sumerian, and that the Sumerian single and dual syllables are inherent in Akkadian, Arabic, Egyptian and other Afroasiatic languages and spoken dialects.

Related to this hypothesis, Mahjoub updated the primeval Arabic language to start from the fourth millennium BC,{{clarify|date=August 2018}} i.e. since the cuneiform writing appeared to codify the Sumerian language. Further to that the historical origination of the [[Arabs]] themselves must start from 12 thousand years,{{clarify|date=August 2018}} since the emergence of the vanguard of the Sumerians in Mesopotamia following the last ice age regression.

These results reflected on his further writings in philosophical propositions by stating that the Sumerian epics produced Chaldean wisdom that produced the concept of the [[logos]], which would later be structurized in [[Greece]] and turned into an abstract mind out of history mobility then with [[western philosophers]], whom claim to inherit Greece, the [[Greek philosophy]] became contrarian to the east despite of being a product of eastwards.{{clarify|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;A. Monem Mahjoub (2004). ''The Heirs of Logos'', World Center for Studies and Research, Tripoli, Libya.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahjoub's position on Islam==
Mahjoub believes that the current [[Islam]] is a new phase of a religion that has been changing since the third century [[Hijri year|AH]] (ninth century AD), and it has been remade in the twentieth century out of a farrago of [[Clergy|clerical]] ideas by contemporary [[clergy]], and that the multilayered understanding of Islam is reshaped to comply with ancient tribal traditions which are still powerful in the modern era, due to the control of the [[Muslim cleric]]s who aspire to establish a [[theological]] authority in the [[Arab countries]] under the name of Islam. Thinking of faith as an individual matter, he considers [[freedom of belief]] to be the most necessary need in Islamic societies.
[[File:The manifesto of Mahjoub.jpg|thumb|The cover of Mahjoub's manifesto against the Islamic priesthood]]
 
He published his ''Manifesto against the Islamic priesthood'' in [[Tunis]], calling to liberate faith from the control of Islamic clergy and to rescue the civil life from religious intervention. He wrote ironically to clerics, "Unchain faith, thus it can leave the muddy body and rise to sky", but in direct words, "Lock up [[Islam]] in [[mosque]]s, [[Christianity]] in churches, and [[Judaism]] in [[Synagogue]]s. Religion is an indoor activity. It's of temples not of streets".&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Mahjoub (2016). Manifesto against the Islamic Priesthood. Tanit Books, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="libyaprospect"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libyaprospect.com/index.php/2016/07/12/what-remains-of-islam-in-libya/|author=|website=Libyaprospect.com|title=What remains of Islam in Libya? &amp;#124; Libya Prospect|accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Mahjoub's career and cultural participations began in the 1980s, with intellectual and literary contributions in events held by Libyan and Arab world institutions and scientific centers, such as Academy of Jamahiry Thought in Tripoli, Alfateh University, Institute of Graduate Studies and Union of Writers.

'''Abdul Bari Jahani''' ({{lang-ps|عبدالباري جهاني}}) is an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] poet, novelist, historian and journalist.He Was born In Khandar Afghanistan On 15 Sep. 1950

==Early life==
He was born in Ahmad Shahyee area of [[Kandahar]] city, in southern [[Afghanistan]]. Jahani often recalls his old good days of childhood in Kandahar where he spent most of his teenage years and talks about how Kandahar was once a melting pot and a common home for all ideologies and beliefs. In his Raazo-Niyaaz book Jahani talks about how he grew up playing in Kandahar as a kid and how peaceful Kandahar was during his high school time. Jahani

==Lineage==
Jahani is from the [[Lodin]] tribe, a sub-tribe of [[Ghilzai]], one of the two main tribes of [[Pashtuns]]. Abdul Bahari Jahani considers the diversity of Afghanistan with various tribes and ethnic groups as the country's strength, and thinks that Afghans have shown throughout the history of their country that they are united and one hand. Their unity is better portrayed when they face an outside threat as a nation or when their country is celebrating a national victory.

==Education==
Abdul Bari Jahani completed his primary, secondary and high school in Mirwais Nika high school of Kandahar city--- a well -known public school in the south. Kandahar University was not yet built when Jahani finished his high school. Upon completing his high school   at Mirwais Nika, Jahani only had two options for his higher education. He could either move to Kabul to study what he wanted to study which was history and literature or move to Nangarhar province—home to the second Afghan university at the time in the country. He chose the former one because unlike Kabul University where students had the option to pursue various majors, Nangarhar University only offered education in the field of medicine. 
Jahani graduated from Kabul University in 1972 with a BA in Pashto literature and history. Upon his graduation from Kabul University, Jahani joined the Pashto Tolana which is a very prestigious literature body in Afghanistan whose members have been prominent Afghan philosophers, historians, poets and writers.  Getting into Pashto Tolana is the equivalent of getting into Harvard Law Review if someone was pursuing legal education in the U.S.  Pashto Tolana approves the entrance of new terminologies into Pashto language and is tasked to develop Pashto language to be richer in terms of new vocabulary. Jahani had tremendous contribution to the development of Pashto language while at Pashto Tolana

==Career==

Jahani has just been given parliamentary vote of approval to serve as a minister in the cabinet of Afghan unity government 2015 for the ministry of information and culture.

Besides being a member of the Pashto Tolana (Pashto Society), Jahani served as the Managing-Editor of a well-known Afghan magazine, Kabul Magazine. Under his leadership, Kabul Magazine witnessed considerable increase in its readership. In his capacity as the Managing Editor of the Magazine, Jahani oversaw the flow of hundreds of informative and educative social, economic and political articles aimed at keeping the Afghan public aware of the state of affairs of their country. Subsequently, Jahani served in the Afghan Ministry of Education (MoE) for two years before he was forced to leave the country during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Jahani’s mission from the very beginning was to inspire Afghan society to walk towards knowledge and education and for that noble goal he join the Afghan government’s education sector.

Communists and leftists feared voices of prominent figures like Jahani and began a government planned campaign against influential and intellectual figures.  Jahani migrated to Pakistan as a refugee and after two years of living as a refugee there, Jahani was offered a job with the Voice of America in Washington DC.  Jahani accepted the offer and joined the Voice of America’s Pashto service in 1983 as an International broadcaster. He has contributed extensively to Pashto language programing of the Radio. Jahani hosted political talk shows, news hour shows and poetry shows at the  Voice of America. His poetry show of late 11PM called “Da Ashnayaano Adabi dera” had listeners in the entire South Asian region and the Middle East. His poetry show had listeners from different age groups including youths and elders. One of his most famous poem which had a huge demand and continues to have, was the story of “three cows and one wolf” that was written in the language of poetry. The moral of the poem is unity.  Like most of his other poetry, in his “three cow one wolf” poem Jahani speaks to his audiences in a plain, natural and understandable language. He warns them of what is at stake if Afghans remain divided and what could be achieved if Afghans leave behind their differences and get united behind a common goal of building a prosperous, stable and peaceful Afghanistan.

Jahani continued to use his able mind and pen and VOA provided him the platform to convey his message of enlightenment to various parts of Afghanistan. With Jahani’s contribution and dedication to excellence and his prominence and popularity amongst Afghans, VOA’s Pashto service ratings and listeners have soared. Jahani’s career as a journalist with the Voice of America has earned him several recognitions and medals from the leadership of the Voice of America. He retired from the Voice of America in 2010, but never ceased to end his advocacy for Afghan unity, Afghan education and Afghan prosperity. He regularly gets offers to speak at  various Afghan events held in Afghanistan, Middle East, Europe and the United States and regularly gets interview request by various Afghan TV and Radio stations in Afghanistan and around the world. Not only that Jahani’s articles about social, political and economic situation of Afghanistan are well received by various public and private print and online media outlets in Afghanistan and around the world. Jahani regularly visits Afghanistan and speak at various events including seminars discussing Pashto literature and education.

==Refugee status and its impact on Jahani’s poetry==

Jahani often refers to the hardships of leaving behind the place where he was born and learned how to walk. His obsession with his homeland, Afghanistan and his constant commendation of all parts of Afghanistan in his poetry has earned him a special place in the hearts of all Afghans from all walks of life and from all ethnic groups. Through his poetry, he commends the beautiful rivers, mountains, ranches and deserts of Afghanistan and how expresses pride in them. In his Wraka Mena ( lost home) poetry collection, Jahani expresses his deep love and compassion for his homeland Afghanistan. The title of the book means lost homeland. In Jahani’s words this book is dedicated to those who have been convicted by fate, whose mouths have been forcibly shut by the unjust rulers and whose pens have been limited by the people of the time.

==Pashto literature==

Jahani is a prominent Pashtun poet of the 21st century. He is considered to be the contemporary Rahman Baba and Khushal Khan Khattak who are two prominent Afghan warrior poets of the 17th century. Jahani’s poetry has various themes including epic, romance, patriotism, bravery and a message of enlightenment. He has published dozens of books in poetry and has translated several Persian poetry books from [[Farsi]] into [[Pashto]] in the language of poetry which is a difficult task to undertake. Besides that Jahani has translated several English books into Pashto.  His main poetry books include: 
*''The Moshko Karwaan'' (د مشکو کاروان) 
*''Wraka Mayna'' (ورکه مېنه)
*''Razo-Niyaaz'' (رازو نیاز) 
*''Da Sabawoon Pa tama'' (د سباوون په تمه)
*''Shpelai'' (شپېلۍ)
*''Paikob'' (پایکوب)
*''Koi toor'' (کوه طور)
*''Kawsar'' (کوثر)

Jahani’s novels and history books include:
*''Da Pashto pa soor aw taal ki da gharbee sandaro shrang'' ( د پښتو په سور او تال کي د غربي سندرو شړنګ) 
*''Herat, Pashtana aw Stara Loba'' ( هرات، پښتانه، ستره لوبه) 
*''Da Khiyam Robayat da Pashto Pa Taal ki'' ( د خیام ربایات د پښتو په تال کي)

==National Anthem and Constitution==

Jahani is considered the most prominent Pashtun poet of the contemporary era. Because of his prominence in Pashto literature and poetry, he was officially requested by the [[President of Afghanistan]], [[Hamid Karzai]] to write the [[Afghan National Anthem]] in late 2006. Prior to that, Jahani also advised the Afghan commission tasked with writing the new constitution in 2004. Jahani's anthem (Pashto: ملي سرود - Milli Surood; Dari: سرود ملی - "Surud-e Milli") was adopted and officially announced at a meeting of the [[Loya Jirga]] in May 2006. The English translation and the Pashto [[transliteration]] of the Afghan National Anthem are as follows:

== Other Translations ==
His poem Wyaar (Pride) has been translated into English by Dawood Azami and the [[Poetry Translation Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.poetrytranslation.org/poems/pride|title=Pride|website=www.poetrytranslation.org|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular support and politics==

Jahani is considered a very influential person in Afghanistan and politicians often rely on his influence over all Afghans particularly Pashtuns in the South and East of the country. Presidential hopefuls during both 2005 and 2009 elections have tried to get Jahani to back their bids for presidency to attract more voters from the south and the east of Afghanistan. Jahani is believed to be in favor of politicians who work for all Afghans regardless of their ethnicity and political affiliations. Jahani believes in a united Afghanistan and often backed leaders who represent all Afghans from all ethnic groups. Jahani backed Dr. [[Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai]] in the [[2009 Afghan presidential elections]]; Ashraf Ghani became the [[president of Afghanistan]] in the [[Afghan presidential election, 2014|April 2014 presidential elections]].

Jahani was supported by a large number of Afghans, particularly youths to run for president himself in the 2014 elections, but he chose not to and his favorite candidate for the presidency is yet to be determined. Whomever Jahani sides with will have a better chance of victory in the southern region of Afghanistan. If one person could unite Pashtuns of the south in the contemporary era, it will be Jahani because there is a lot respect in Afghanistan particularly in the south for his sense of patriotism, his pride in Afghan history and his intellectual abilities. Jahani is a strong critic and opponent of [[corruption in Afghanistan]] and his intellectual crusade against the rampant corruption of the Afghan government has impacted his relationships with President Karzai who has a long-standing friendship with Jahani. Their friendship witnessed further rift when Jahani backed the bid of Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai for president in the 2009 elections of Afghanistan in which [[Hamid Karzai]] won a second term in office.

==Criticism==

Jahani is criticized by some for basing some of his poetry on an epic theme which according to critics invites people to war and violence, but his proponents not only defend his epic poetry and his efforts to depict Afghan history in the language of poems, but also claim that Jahani’s poetry invites Afghans to unity, solidarity, peace, education and progress. His recent poem that sparked a national debate amongst scholars about what role intellectuals could play in conflict resolution efforts was about a suicide bomber and his mother in which he depicted good through the role of a desperate mother and bad through the role of a brainwashed son who wanted to carry out a suicide attack for a quest to earn heaven and salvation. Some critics viewed the poem as recognition of suicide attacks as a legit and glorifying act while others viewed the poem as informative and educative for those people who fall victims of terrorists and extremists.&lt;ref name="AAN"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/finally-a-complete-afghan-cabinet-the-next-16-minister-nominees-and-their-biographies/ |title=Finally a Complete Afghan Cabinet?

The poem is written in a dialogue form between a mother and a son. The poem is set to music by Afghan singer Bashir Maidani with the title "Nasihat" available on [[YouTube]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ife-2fvDaak |title=Video: Bashir Maidani - Nasihat, Lyrics by Bari Jahani|website=[[YouTube]] |date=2013-07-11 |access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Maidani's 2011 album ''Afsoz'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.afghan123.com/music/bashir-maidani/afsoz/ |title=Bashir Maidani - Afsoz Album |website=AFGHAN123 |language=en-gb |access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the song is very popular amongst Pashtoons in the world because of Jahani's excellent poetry.

==Singers==

Jahani’s poems have been picked by well-known Afghan singers such as Dr. Fetrat Nashnas, Farhaad Darya, Waheed Qasemi, Waheed Saberi, Bashir Maidani and other Afghan singers.

The '''Adubi War''' (known locally as '''Ogun Adubi''' or '''Egba Uprising''') was a conflict in June and July 1918 in the British [[Colonial Nigeria|Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria]] ostensibly because of the imposition of colonial taxation.{{sfn|Oduntan|2010|p=218}} Direct taxes were introduced by the colonial government along with existing forced labour obligations and fees. On the 7th June, the British arrested 70 [[Egba people|Egba]] chiefs and issued an ultimatum that resisters should lay down their arms, pay the taxes and obey the local leadership.

==The War==
On 11 June, a party of soldiers, recently returned from East Africa, were brought in to help police the area and keep the peace. On 13 June, Egba rebels pulled up railway lines at Agbesi and derailed a train. Other rebels demolished the train station at Wasinmi and murdered the British agent; the Oba Osile, the African leader of the north-eastern Egba district.{{sfn|Hogan|2013|p=304}} Hostilities between the 30,000 rebels and colonial troops continued for about three weeks at [[Otite]], [[Tappona]], [[Mokoloki]] and [[Lalako]] but by the 10th July, the rebellion had been put down and the leaders killed or arrested.{{sfn|Hogan|2013|p=304}}

==Aftermath==
About 600 people were killed, including the British agent and the Oba Osile, although this may have been due to a dispute over land and unconnected to the uprising.{{sfn|Oduntan|2010|pp=219, 231, 220}} The incident led to the abrogation of Abeokutan independence in 1918 and the introduction of [[forced labour]] in the region; imposition of the [[direct taxation|direct taxes]] was postponed until 1925.{{sfn|Falola|Genova|2009|pp=110–111}}{{sfn|Hogan|2013|pp=299–313}} British soldiers who repressed the revolt received the [[Africa General Service Medal]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7405">The '''Borussian myth''' or '''Borussian legend'''&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Michael (1992). ''Early Modern Germany, 1477-1806'', MacMillan Press and University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, p. xi. {{ISBN|0-8122-1427-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given by 20th-century historians of German history to the earlier idea that [[German unification]] was inevitable, and that it was [[Prussia]]'s destiny to accomplish it.  The Borussian myth is an example of a [[teleological]] argument.  ''Borussia'' is the Latin name for Prussia.

==Teleological arguments==
A teleological argument holds all things to be designed for, or directed toward, a specific final result.  That specific result gives events and actions, even retrospectively, an inherent purpose.  When applied to the historical process, an historical teleological argument posits the result as the inevitable trajectory of a specific set of events.  These events lead "inevitably," as [[Karl Marx]] or [[Friedrich Engels]] proposed, to a specific set of conditions or situations; the resolution of those lead to another, and so on.  This goal-oriented, 'teleological' notion of the historical process as a whole is present in a variety of arguments about the past: the "inevitability," for example, of the revolution of the proletariat and the [[Whig history|"Whiggish"]] narrative of past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater liberty and enlightenment that culminated in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Butterfield]], ''The Whiggish Interpretation of History,'' (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinning the myth==

The narrative of the heroic past fell to such nationalist German historians as  [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] (1834–1896), [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903), and [[Heinrich von Sybel]] (1817–1895), to name three. Treitschke in particular viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, ''The peculiarities of German history: bourgeois society and politics in nineteenth-century Germany.'' Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-19-873057-6}} p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; These historical arguments can also be called the grand, or great, narratives but they are inherently [[ethnocentric]], at least when applied to the historical process.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;  Treitschke's'' History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century'', published in 1879, has perhaps a misleading title: it privileges the history of Prussia over the history of other German states, and it tells the story of the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this myth (''Borussia'' is the Latin name for Prussia) established Prussia as Germany's savior; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish this.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Friedrich, ''The other Prussia: royal Prussia, Poland and liberty, 1569–1772'', New York, 2000, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this story, Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. This interpretation emphasizes Prussia's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of [[Napoleon]]'s power in 1814, at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], creating some semblance of economic unity through the ''[[Zollverein]]'' (German customs union), and uniting Germans under one proud flag after the defeat of France in the [[Franco Prussian War]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Many modern historians describe this myth, without subscribing to it: for example, Rudy Koshar, ''Germany's Transient Pasts: Preservation and the National Memory in the Twentieth Century.'' Chapel Hill, 1998; Hans Kohn. ''German history; some new German views.'' Boston, 1954; Thomas Nipperdey, ''Germany history from Napoleon to Bismarck.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deconstructing the myth==

After [[World War II]], various historians of Germany sought to re-examine the German past, in part to understand the immediate German past and the [[Holocaust]], and in part to understand Germany's supposed [[democratic deficit]]: Theoretically, Germans were inexperienced with democracy and self-government because their experience in unification came under the leadership of the least democratic of the German states (Prussia). This inevitably led to, first, [[World War I]], and second the failure of the [[Weimar Republic]], third, to the rise of [[National Socialism]], and fourth, to [[World War II]].

The Borussian myth was linked to the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' theory of Germany's ''peculiar road'' to modernity.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, ''Peculiarities of German History,'' p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  The set of circumstances that predated the Unification, for example, the so-called failure of the [[1848 revolution|1848 German revolutions]] and the elimination of [[German dualism|Austria]] as a possible leader in the unification process strengthen the myth's appeal.  In this way, teleological arguments tend to work backward from an event, to describe and rationalize all trends leading to it;&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;  they are [[genealogy|genealogical]]&amp;mdash;trace from the present to the past&amp;mdash;rather than historical, which explores the past to the present.

In the 1970s, and later, as [[social history|social]] and [[cultural history|cultural]] historians examined nineteenth-century German history in greater depth, they realized that not only was there a vibrant and lively German culture without Prussia, but they also deconstructed significant elements of the ''Sonderweg'' theory as well.  They discovered, for example, that the 1848 Revolutions in Germany actually had some significant successes.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, Rhineland radicals: the democratic movement and the revolution of 1848–1849. Princeton, N.J., 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the history of 19th-century Germany was not a long process of grinding under the heel of Prussian militarism, but instead a process of economic expansion, testing of democratic institutions, the writing and testing of constitutions, and the creation of social insurance systems to maintain long term economic security.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn, ''The long nineteenth century: a history of Germany, 1780–1918.''

[[File:British Records Association at the School of Advanced Study History Day Oct. 2017 01.jpg|thumb|British Records Association at the School of Advanced Study History Day, 2017]]
The '''British Records Association''' (widely known as the '''BRA''', pronounced as three letters) is a British [[learned society]] founded in 1932 concerned with historic records and [[archive]]s. It is a [[registered charity]] (no. 227464).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=227464&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 |title=British Records Association |publisher=Charity Commission of England and Wales |accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It issues a journal, ''Archives'', and other publications; hosts conferences and seminars; and undertakes other activities to promote the care and preservation of archives and the interests of archive users at a national level. Membership is open to all, and the association (in contrast to exclusively scholarly bodies, and exclusively professional bodies) therefore plays a particular role as a forum which brings together owners of archives, academic and amateur documentary researchers, [[archivist]]s and [[librarian]]s, and institutions and societies concerned with archives.

==History==
The association was formally founded in 1932, but it took over the Records Preservation Section established three years earlier in 1929 by the [[British Record Society]] (see below). The similarity of name between the two bodies was a deliberate choice, made in order to emphasise continuity.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1989, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the new association – and its not entirely amicable split from the BRS – was largely the initiative of (Sir) [[Hilary Jenkinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1989, pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ellis, "Records Preservation from BRS to BRA: the shaping of the British Records Association and of its Records Preservation Section, 1928–1979", in ''Jubilee Essays'' 1992, pp. 16–30.&lt;/ref&gt; He remained the BRA's guiding force for nearly 30 years. From 1930 to 1932 he had served as Secretary of the Drafting Committee which established the association; and he subsequently served as its Joint Honorary Secretary 1932–47; Chairman of the Records Preservation Section 1947–61; Vice-President of the association 1954–61; and as a member of most of its committees.&lt;ref&gt;Bond 1962, pp. 86–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Other active members in the early years included [[George Herbert Fowler|G. H. Fowler]], [[Joan Wake]], [[Irene Churchill]], [[Kathleen Major]], [[William Le Hardy]], and [[H. M. Cashmore]].

Prior to the establishment of the [[Society of Archivists|Society of Local Archivists]] in 1947, the BRA was the closest that Britain had to a [[professional association]] for archivists, and it played a central role in laying down professional standards and principles, and in promoting the establishment of professionally staffed local archive services in the post-War years.&lt;ref&gt;Bond 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Felix Hull, "The BRA and the new post-War local Record Offices: I", in ''Jubilee Essays'' 1992, pp. 37–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker 2018, pp. 39−40.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], when the British government promoted a [[Paper Salvage 1939–50|salvage campaign]] to encourage the recycling of waste paper, the BRA ran a vigorous counter-campaign to safeguard against the over-enthusiastic destruction of records of historical value.&lt;ref&gt;Bond 1962, pp. 75–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1989, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker 2018, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, it produced a report on ''British Records after the War'', which proposed legislation to control local and private archives.&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted as {{cite book| chapter=British Records after the War |year=1980 |editor1-first=Roger H. |editor1-last=Ellis |editor2-first=Peter |editor2-last=Walne |title=Selected Writings of Sir Hilary Jenkinson |place=Stroud |publisher=Alan Sutton |isbn=0-904387-52-6 |pages=208–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of its  proposals proved to be too draconian for general acceptance, they did lead to the establishment of the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#Other services|National Register of Archives]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Bond 1962, pp. 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Somerville, "Wartime", in ''Jubilee Essays'' 1992, pp. 31–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker 2018, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1976 to 1992, the BRA's administrative secretary was the former Soviet spy [[John Vassall]], who, following his release from prison, had begun a new life under the name John Phillips.

==Presidency==
By tradition, the president of the association is the [[Master of the Rolls]] of the day. The current president is therefore [[Terence Etherton|Sir Terence Etherton]]. At the time of the BRA's foundation, and until 1958, the Master of the Rolls was also Keeper of Public Records, and nominal head of the [[Public Record Office]]. Under the [[Public Records Act 1958]], responsibility for public records was transferred from the Master of the Rolls to the [[Lord Chancellor]]; but the BRA chose not to follow this lead.

==Publications==

===Journal===
The association has published a journal, ''Archives'', twice-yearly since 1949. It is [[Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]], and contains a range of articles relating to the history, preservation, accessibility and use of archives, historical case-studies drawing heavily on archival research, and discussions of archival trends, theories and practices. It also carries reports and reviews of recent archival publications, web sites, exhibits and events. From spring 2019, the journal will be published on behalf of the Association by [[Liverpool University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Archives'': agreement signed with Liverpool University Press |publisher=British Records Association |url=http://www.britishrecordsassociation.org.uk/news/archives-agreement-signed-with-liverpool-university-press/ |accessdate=23 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal's editors have been: Roger Ellis, 1949–57; Joan Lancaster, 1957–63; Arthur Owen, 1964–76; Andrew Cook, 1977–84; John Warner-Davies/Davies, 1985–89; [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]], 1990–2005; [[Ruth Paley]], 2006–date.

===Archives and the User===
Since 1970, the association has published a series of handbooks providing introductory guides to historical documentary sources for researchers and editors, under the series title "Archives and the User". Titles published to date are:

===Other publications===
The association publishes a twice-yearly newsletter (from 2011, in electronic form). It has from time to time issued other occasional publications, including memoranda on good practice; and conference proceedings.

==Conferences and meetings==
The BRA holds an annual one-day conference, focusing on a particular thematic area of historical records. Until 2017, the conference was normally held in late November or early December; but the decision was then taken to schedule the next conference for Spring 2019 (no conference being held in 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BRA Annual Conference |work=BRA Newsletter |volume=4 |issue=5 |date=Winter 2017-18 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Maurice Bond Lecture, named after the former Clerk of the [[Parliamentary Archives|House of Lords Record Office]], is held in the late autumn (normally October), and is delivered by a speaker prominent in the world of scholarship, record-keeping or politics. Recent Maurice Bond Lecturers have included [[Clyde Jeavons]], formerly of the [[BFI National Archive|National Film and Television Archive]] (2005), [[Nicholas Rodger]] (2006), [[Nicholas Kingsley]] of [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] (2007), [[Bamber Gascoigne]] (2008), [[Richard Horton (editor)|Richard Horton]], editor-in-chief of ''[[The Lancet]]'' (2009), [[Frank Prochaska]] (2010), [[Michael Meadowcroft]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] (2011), [[Peter Hennessy]] (2012), Professor [[:nl:Eric Ketelaar|Eric Ketelaar]] (2013), [[Jeremy Musson]] (2014), [[Fiona Skillen]] (2015), [[Caroline Shenton]] (2016), and [[Joan Winterkorn]] (2017). 

The association also holds other occasional conferences, seminars and training sessions.

==Records Preservation Section==
[[File:BRA stamp.jpg|thumb|right|BRA stamp on a historic document, showing that it has passed through the hands of the Records Preservation Section. The number indicates its earlier [[provenance]].]]
The Records Preservation Section (originally Records Preservation Committee, or Records Preservation Branch) was established under the auspices of the [[British Record Society]] in 1929, in the aftermath of the [[Law of Property Act 1922]] and the [[Land Registration Act 1925]], both of which rendered certain classes of historical property record redundant for legal purposes, and so at risk of destruction. It was partly inspired by (though not directly modelled on) the example of the [[The Art Fund|National Art Collections Fund]]. As the Records Preservation Section (RPS), its responsibilities and assets were formally transferred to the newly formed British Records Association in March 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Harris 1989, pp. 3–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, "Records Preservation from BRS to BRA", in ''Jubilee Essays'' 1992, pp. 16–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the RPS is to act as a rescue organisation and clearing-house for records deemed to be at risk, passing them on to appropriate institutional custodians. In practice, most of the records it has received have always come from the offices of London solicitors, and have been transferred to [[county record office]]s and other local archive repositories around the United Kingdom.

The work of the RPS was carried out largely by volunteers from its foundation until 1948, when a paid executive officer was appointed. From 1950 to 2009 the association was able to employ a qualified archivist (and at times other staff), principally to undertake Records Preservation work. This was made possible in part through the receipt of an annual [[grant-in-aid]] from [[HM Treasury]], paid from 1959 to 2000; but the work is now again carried out on an entirely voluntary basis.&lt;ref&gt;Baker 2018, pp. 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Knickerbocker Harley''' is an academic [[economic historian]] who has written on a wide range of topics including the British [[industrial revolution]], the late nineteenth century international economy, and the impact of [[technological change]]. He is a practitioner of the [[Cliometrics|New Economic History]].&lt;ref&gt;Harley, 2002, pp. 16, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

At Harvard he studied under [[Alexander Gerschenkron]]. He completed his dissertation, ''Shipbuilding and Shipping in the Late Nineteenth Century'', on the transition from wooden [[sailing ships]] to steel [[Steamship|steamers]], in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Harley, 2002, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He took a professorship at the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 1978 he moved to the [[University of Western Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economics.uwo.ca/people/faculty/harley.html |title=C.

'''Classical archaeology''' is the archaeological investigation of the [[Mediterranean]] civilizations of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Beazley.ox.ac.uk|url=http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/BeazleyAdmin/Script2/default.htm|title=The Beazley Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteenth-century archaeologists such as [[Heinrich Schliemann]] were drawn to study the societies they had read about in Latin and Greek texts. Many universities and foreign nations maintain excavation programs and schools in the area-such is the enduring appeal of the region's archaeology. 

==Cultures discussed==
Classical archaeology in its strictest, most traditional sense applies only to the study of Classical Athenian culture and the culture of the Roman Republic and Empire.  However, over the course of the last century, the field has expanded to include discussions of the elaborate mosaic of cultures that produced the civilizations of Ancient Greece and Rome.  Classical archaeologists interested in Greece frequently discuss Crete and the [[Minoan civilization]] present on that island during the Bronze Age.  They also discuss the [[Helladic]] and [[Geometric]] periods, as well as occasionally discussing the [[Neolithic]] period as it pertains to Greece. Even during the Classical period, it is completely untrue to say that Greece had one true culture - a great deal of regional variation was present, and much of the study of Greek archaeology lies in examination of these regional differences.  Greek archaeology covers the Hellenistic period as well, frequently compelling the classical archaeologist to examine the Greek influences present in all the areas that were part of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire, including much of the Middle East and Egypt.

Classical archaeologists interested in Roman civilization discuss the influence of the [[Etruscans]] and other early cultures present on the Italic Peninsula.  They also discuss the subcultures present within the Roman Republic and Empire based on regional differences, and any discussion of the later empire requires at least a partial segue into the [[Byzantine Empire]].

==Excavations==
While inspired by ancient texts and sometimes using them to interpret artifacts, classical archaeology would not exist without ancient artifacts.  Though much of classical archaeology (like any kind of archaeology) is performed by scholars in their studies, the most vibrant and crucial parts of classical archaeology are the archaeological excavations, more commonly known as "digs."  Excavation techniques at first were modelled after excavations in Egypt and the Near East and searched for large artifacts and walls without much care for the delicate remains that might have existed in the ground around these artifacts.  Many of the earliest sites still cannot be dated in a satisfying manner because the [[stratigraphy]], soil layers with embedded artifacts used to determine the age of a site, was completely stripped away. Early excavations also often failed to record the items they found in sufficient detail, making it difficult to date artifacts, determine precisely where they were found, or establish a connection between objects that may have been found together.  Over time, excavation techniques have greatly improved and the amount of information gleaned from each excavation is exponentially greater than that recorded in early excavations. While excavation reports now take many years to compile due to the level of detail included and analyzed.

== Early life and education ==
Carrasco descends from several generations of El Paso, Texas educators. His grandfather, Miguel Carrasco, founded and directed the Smelter Vocational School in El Paso Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6AVt2MO0tYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=%22Smelter+Vocational+School%22+%22carrasco%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CTis_s0OvL&amp;sig=ulPLZfERi8SHE8XBoD7_U8MFHPY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJuO-epoXVAhUGS2MKHXvbCIkQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Smelter%20Vocational%20School%22%20%22carrasco%22&amp;f=false|title=Smeltertown: Making and Remembering a Southwest Border Community|last=Perales|first=Monica|date=2010-09-13|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807899564|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his father,  David L. Carrasco''',''' was the first Mexican American to serve as the Head Men’s Basketball Coach at a major U.S. university, American University. His father also founded and directed the El Paso Job Corps Center in El Paso, Texas, which was renamed the David L. Carrasco Job Corps Center in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://davidlcarrasco.jobcorps.gov/node/16|title=About Us {{!}} David L. Carrasco Job Corps Center|website=davidlcarrasco.jobcorps.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Carrasco received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] at Western Maryland College with a major in English Literature, and attended the University of Chicago where he earned three degrees in nine years: a [[Master of Theology]], [[Master of Arts|MA]] in History of Religions, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in the History of Religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/carrasco-david-1944|title=Carrasco, David 1944- - Dictionary definition of Carrasco, David 1944- {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional life ==
In 1978, Carrasco was invited by the Mexican archaeologist Eduardo Matos Moctezuma to participate in the interpretation of the astonishing discoveries made at the excavation of the Great Aztec Temple in Mexico City. One general result of the friendship and collaborations between Matos and Carrasco is the more than three decades of seminars and over 30 book publications on Mesoamerican history and religion which have emerged from the Moses Mesoamerican Archive and Research Project. These publications include Carrasco's best selling academic title Religions of Mesoamerica: Cosmovision and Ceremonial Centers and City of Sacrifice, which the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes praised as "a brilliant, timely, provocative, and eternal book." With the crucial assistance of Scott Sessions, the Archive produced the multiple award-winning Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures that became the most significant reference work on Mesoamerica since the Handbook of Middle American Indians. Carrasco’s encyclopedia won 3 publication awards. Among the most distinguished members of the Mesoamerican Archive and Research Project are [[Doris Heyden]], John D. Hoag, [[H.B. Nicholson]], [[Alfredo López Austin]], [[Anthony Aveni]], [[Elizabeth H. Boone]], Charles H. Long, [[Leonardo López Luján]], [[William L. Fash]], Barbara Fash, Saburo Sugiyama, [[José Cuéllar]], William Taylor Lindsay Jones, and Scott Sessions.

His first book publication, Quetzalcoatl and the Irony of Empire: Myths and Prophecies in the Aztec Tradition (University of Chicago Press), won the Chancellor's Book Prize at the University of Colorado&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/010524/alumni-awards.shtml|title=Alumni Association will honor members at annual reunion|website=chronicle.uchicago.edu|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to H.B. Nicholson "This book, rich in ideas, constituting a novel approach... Recommended to all serious students of the New World's most advanced indigenous civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://upcolorado.com/university-press-of-colorado/item/1660-quetzalcoatl-and-the-irony-of-empire|title=University Press of Colorado - Quetzalcoatl and the Irony of Empire|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted as "one of the foremost scholars of Mesoamerican religions and cultures",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k85JKr1OXcQC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=%22one+of+the+foremost+scholars+of+Mesoamerican+religions+and+cultures%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=33M5TGObi9&amp;sig=IOfRHb32pe17z5NK4SIJGXJ2JWU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidgbrWhIXVAhVW_WMKHdhvClAQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22one%20of%20the%20foremost%20scholars%20of%20Mesoamerican%20religions%20and%20cultures%22&amp;f=false|title=An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies|last=Espín|first=Orlando O.|last2=Nickoloff|first2=James B.|date=2007|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=9780814658567|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrasco has contributed particularly to the study of history, religion and symbolism of the [[Aztec]] and [[Teotihuacan]] cultures. Several of his publications have received awards, and in 2004, he received the [[Order of the Aztec Eagle|Orden Mexicana del Águila Azteca]], the highest decoration awarded by the [[Mexican government]] to foreigners.  While receiving the [[Order of the Aztec Eagle|Orden Mexicana del Águila Azteca]], Carrasco was described as "a man of our time, a man of enormous vitality and value,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://davidcarrascohistorian.com/news|title=Davíd Carrasco|last=https://goodlookingsoftware.com|first=Aaron Surrain|website=davidcarrascohistorian.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Carlos de Icaza, the Ambassador of Mexico.  This award was the result of Carrasco’s writings on Mesoamerican cities and religions, his teachings on the history of religions and Mexican American cultures, and his work at the Aztec Templo Mayor in Mexico City. In 2003 he was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His co-edited (with [[Nicholas J. Cull]]) 2004 book, ''Alambrista and the U.S.-Mexico Border: Film, Music and Stories of Undocumented Immigrants'', was named a Southwest Book of the Year by the Tucson-Pima County Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/josecuel/alambritsta/alambrista.html|title=Alambrista Multimedia Project|website=userwww.sfsu.edu|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Carrasco received the Mircea Eliade Jubilee medal, presented in absentia by the President of Romania, Traian Basescu. The Mircea Eliade award, named for the preeminent Romanian-born interpreter of world religions, was given as a sign of appreciation for contributions in the study of history of religion.  In 2011, he was unanimously voted a Corresponding Member of the [[Academia Mexicana de la Historia|Mexican Academy of History]], joining other historians, artists, writers, and intellectuals who have distinguished themselves, by their contributions and knowledge, to the culture, education, and love of Mexico.  Carrasco's classroom teaching has resulted in recognition by the University of Colorado where he was chosen Presidential Teaching Scholar, 1991–93,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cu.edu/ptsp/directory-presidents-teaching-scholars|title=Directory of President's Teaching Scholars|last=jon|date=2015-05-12|work=University of Colorado|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at Harvard University where he was awarded the Petra T. Shattuck Excellence in Teaching Award in 2011 in the Harvard Extension School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://davidcarrascohistorian.com/about|title=Davíd Carrasco|last=https://goodlookingsoftware.com|first=Aaron Surrain|website=davidcarrascohistorian.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Carrasco was chosen as the Alumnus of the Year at the University of Chicago Divinity School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://divinity.uchicago.edu/alumni-year|title=Alumni of the Year {{!}} The University of Chicago Divinity School|website=divinity.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrasco’s encounter with the Mexica and Spanish literature of the ‘encuentro’ turned his attention to the problem of colonialism and religious syncretism. Following the work of William B. Taylor, he wrote an important critique entitled “Jaguar Christians in the Contact Zone”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latinobibliography.org/node/4936|title=Jaguar Christians in the Contact Zone: concealed narratives in the histories of religions in the Americas {{!}} The Latino Bibliography Project|website=www.latinobibliography.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this and subsequent essays, he strove to illuminate how indigenous peoples negotiated and manipulated Christian symbols and rites in terms of their local and ancestral traditions.  He also turned his eyes towards the problem in the emerging Chicano Studies fields of scholarship which claimed to be rooted, in part, in the oro del barrio – the oral traditions and daily lives of Mexican American communities in the US. The more social science literature he read, the more he saw how religiosity was erased in the leading books and journals. Where were the shrines, home altars, miracles, symbols of saints, Jesus, curanderos and espiritistas and La Virgen de Guadalupe, among other expressions of Chicano religiosity? Did they not exist in the ‘oro del barrio’ or in the ‘pueblo/pueblo’ models claiming to illuminate the social history of Mexican Americans? Carrasco produced three significant essays designed to illuminate Chicano and Latino religiosity: “Bless Me, Ultima as a Religious Text” which is included in the Chicano Studies Reader,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/NORCH3.html|title=University of Washington Press - Books - The Chicano Studies Reader|website=www.washington.edu|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Cuando Dios y Usted Quiere: Between Religious Experience and Social Thought”, and “Borderlands and the biblical hurricane: Images and Rhythms of Latino Life”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231794910_Borderlands_and_the_biblical_hurricane_Images_and_Stories_of_Latin_American_Rhythms_of_Life|title=Borderlands and the "biblical hurricane": Images and Stories of Latin American Rhythms of Life|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Harvard, Carrasco became associated with the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies and was introduced to the Mapa de Cuauhtinchan #2 through the generosity of the Mexican philanthropist Angeles Espinosa Yglesias. Carrasco organized a 15-person scholarly team in a 5-year analysis of this early 16th-century codex/mapa resulting in the award-winning book, co-edited with Scott Sessions, Cave, City and Eagle’s Nest: An Interpretive Journey Through the Mapa de Cuauhtinchan #2 which was translated into Spanish in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nativebooks.omeka.net/items/show/7|title=Mapa de Cuauhtinchan No. 2|last=|first=|date=|website=nativebooks.omeka.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his contributions to the history of religions Carrasco was invited to participate in three summer Eranos conferences in Ascona, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eranos.org/content/html/start_english.html|title=ERANOS HOMEPAGE - Associazione Amici di Eranos, Ascona|website=www.eranos.org|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizer during this epoch of Eranos Tagungen was the social philosopher Tilo Schabert who invited Carrasco to speak at conferences on the themes of ‘Guilt – Schuld – La Colpa – La Culpabilité”, 1996, ‘The Language of Masks – Die Sprache der Masken – Il Linguaggio delle Maschere – Le Language des Masques, 1998 and ‘Religions – the religious experience / Religionen – die religiöse Erfahrung / Religions – l'expérience religieuse / Religioni – l'esperienza religiosa” 2004. Carrasco was also present at the research seminar on Eranos held in the fall of 2000 on the Monte Verità. While he didn't deliver a paper, Carrasco actively took part in the delibarations, and was present throughout the seminar. The Proceedings of the seminar were published, to which Carrasco contributed a recollection.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Barone, Matthias Riedl, Alexandra Tischel, eds. Pioniere, Poeten, Professoren. Eranos und der Monte Verità in der Zivilisationsgeschichte des 20. Jahrhunderts (Wuerzburg: Koenigshausen &amp; Neumann, 2004) = Eranos Series, Vol 11., section "Erfahrung und Erinnerung/Experience and Memory" on page 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrasco is presently working on a book of his collected essays and another on the 500th anniversary of the war for Tenochtitlan/Mexico City led by Fernando Cortez against Moctezuma Xocoyotzin's Aztecs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5873">'''Digital classics''' is the application of the tools of [[digital humanities]] to the field of [[classics]], or more broadly to the study of the [[ancient world]].

==History==

Classics was one of the first of the humanities disciplines to adopt computing approaches; the first references to the use of computing in the classical humanities date to the early 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Arguably, the first references to the use of computing to study a text in a classical language are to a project at IBM to create a computer generated concordance of Aquinas beginning in 1949; for this, see Theodore F. Brunner, "Classics and the Computer: The History of a Relationship," in ''Accessing Antiquity: The Computerization of Classical Studies'' (1993), ed. Jon Solomon, Tucson: U. Arizona Press, for a general introduction to the early history of computing in the classical humanities.&lt;/ref&gt; which might be surprising considering the reputation of the discipline as old-fashioned and stuffily traditionalist.&lt;ref&gt;See also: Busa, Roberto. (1980). ‘The Annals of Humanities Computing: The Index Thomisticus’, in ''Computers and the Humanities'' 14:83-90. The ''[http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/ Index Thomisticus]'' is arguably the first humanities computing project and this seminal article deals specifically with the digitisation of this Latin text as well as reflecting on the nature and purpose of this field of scholarship.&lt;/ref&gt; Major projects such as the [[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]], founded in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. http://www.tlg.uci.edu/about/history.php for the history of this project&lt;/ref&gt; and the text collections of the [[Packard Humanities Institute]] set the trend, and there are still a significantly large number of ancient world projects among Humanities Computing projects today.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the projects listed at http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cch/research/projects.html or http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/iathrails/projects/homepage&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the success of traditional scholarly publications in digital guises, such as seen in the ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'',&lt;ref&gt;See http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/about.html for information on the history and scope of this publication&lt;/ref&gt; and the early adoption of hypertext in high profile projects like the Perseus Digital Library&lt;ref&gt;The Perseus Project was originally published on the HyperCard platform in 1990 — around the time of the invention of the World Wide Web; see archival versions of the Perseus 1.0 documentation, http://vanth.perseus.tufts.edu/Help/P1/Doc1.info.html and the Platform-Independent Perseus documentation, http://vanth.perseus.tufts.edu/Help/PIP2/Goals_Help.html, Mylonas, "The Perseus Project," http://xml.coverpages.org/mylonasPerseus.html, and Mylonas, Crane, Morrell, and Smith, "The Perseus Project: Data in the Electronic Age" in Solomon, ''Accessing Antiquity'' ''op. cit.'' for information toward a history of Perseus' use of hypertext platforms and other information infrastructures.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to legitimize computing in the study of classics in ways that has not always been the case in other areas of the humanities.

This apparent paradox may be as a result of the many methodologies and different sources of evidence that classicists have always had to embrace, from literary sources and linguistics, to art history and archaeology, history, philosophy, religious theory, ancient documents such as [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyrology|papyri]], and so forth. The fragmentary nature of many of the texts and languages of the ancient world, the scattered evidence from the material culture of ancient Greece and Rome, and the necessity to evaluate all these varieties of evidence in context are particularly likely to benefit from digital approaches such as databases, text markup, and image manipulation.

==Digital classics projects==
There are currently several major projects that aim to encourage and develop digital approaches to classical scholarship. The Stoa Consortium at the [[University of Kentucky]] distributes news of the discipline, and serves as a peer-reviewed electronic publication venue, and encourages [[open source]] approaches to digital classics. The [[Perseus Project]] is a digital library that also provides a collection of digital texts and analysis tools to the public; principally (but not exclusively) classical.  [[Digital Classicist]] at [[King's College London]] is another project and community which shares information and advice about the [[digital humanities]] applied to the field of classics.&lt;ref&gt;See http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liverpool Classics Mailing List is a project which can be subscribed to in which one receives email regarding Classics events around the world, as well as call for papers, studentships and public lectures.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.lsoft.com/scripts/wl.exe?SL1=CLASSICISTS&amp;H=LISTSERV.LIV.AC.UK for details&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Epigram of Amazaspos''' ({{lang-ka|ამაზასპის ეპიგრამა}}) is a [[funerary text|funerary]] [[epigram]] written in [[Ancient Greek]] on an inscription found in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; It [[Memorialization|memorialises]] the [[death]] of the [[Pharnavazid dynasty|Pharnavazid]]&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; royal prince Amazaspos, brother of kings [[Mihrdat I of Iberia|Mihrdat I]] and [[Rhadamistus]], son of king [[Pharasmanes I of Iberia]], who died at [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]] while accompanying the emperor [[Trajan]] on his Parthian expedition during the [[Roman–Parthian Wars]].&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;Rapp, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Sydney, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The epigram seems to be a work of some ''[[litterateur]]'' in emperor Trajan's company during his Parthian expedition and it seems he was personally aware of Amazaspos' charms where he is compared to "modest maidens". It is suggested that this poet may have been emperor [[Hadrian]] himself. Authorship of the epigram for prince Amazaspos by Hadrian would explain how the text was available to be inscribed in [[Rome]] as the stone may have been erected there in a public place during Hadrian's reign as a reminder of the cost to the [[Roman Empire]] of its policy of expansion as Hadrian quickly gave up almost all the lands Trajan had conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Chaniotis, Corsten, Stroud &amp; Tybout, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably the prince's remains had also been transferred by Hadrian to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Braund, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription is dated 114-117 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Chaniotis, Corsten, Stroud &amp; Tybout, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Amazaspos is also mentioned in [[Armazi stele of Vespasian]],&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt; though according to [[Cyril Toumanoff]] that Amazaspos is King [[Amazasp I of Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eric Alfred Havelock''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|v|l|ɒ|k}}; 3 June 1903&amp;nbsp;– 4 April 1988) was a British [[classics|classicist]] who spent most of his life in Canada and the United States. He was a professor at the [[University of Toronto]] and was active in the Canadian socialist movement during the 1930s. In the 1960s and 1970s, he served as chair of the classics departments at both [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale]]. Although he was trained in the turn-of-the-20th-century [[Oxbridge]] tradition of classical studies, which saw [[Greek philosophy|Greek intellectual history]] as an unbroken chain of related ideas, Havelock broke radically with his own teachers and proposed an entirely new model for understanding the classical world, based on a sharp division between literature of the 6th and 5th centuries BC on the one hand, and that of the 4th on the other.

Much of Havelock's work was devoted to addressing a single thesis: that all of [[Western philosophy|Western thought]] is informed by a profound shift in the kinds of ideas available to the human mind at the point that [[Greek philosophy]] converted from an [[Oral tradition|oral]] to a [[literacy|literate]] form. The idea has been very controversial in classical studies, and has been rejected outright both by many of Havelock's contemporaries and modern classicists. Havelock and his ideas have nonetheless had far-reaching influence, both in classical studies and other academic areas. He and [[Walter J. Ong]] (who was himself strongly influenced by Havelock) essentially founded the field that studies transitions from [[orality]] to literacy, and Havelock has been one of the most frequently cited theorists in that field; as an account of communication, his work profoundly affected the media theories of [[Harold Innis]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. Havelock's influence has spread beyond the study of the classical world to that of analogous transitions in other times and places.

==Education and early academic career==
Born in London, Havelock grew up in Scotland where he attended [[Greenock Academy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

enrollment at [[The Leys School]] in [[Cambridge]] at the age of 14. He studied there with [[William Henry Balgarnie|W. H. Balgarnie]], a classicist to whom Havelock gives considerable credit.&lt;ref&gt;Havelock, ''The Lyric Genius of Catullus'', second ed. (New York: Russell and Russell, 1967), i.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, Havelock started at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].

[[File:POxy3679 Parts Plato Republic.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Fragmented Greek text on a portion of papyrus||[[Papyrus]] manuscript of Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato dialogue)|Republic]]'']]

While studying under [[F. M. Cornford]] at Cambridge, Havelock began to question the received wisdom about the nature of [[pre-Socratic philosophy]] and, in particular, about its relationship with [[Socrates|Socratic thought]]. In ''The Literate Revolution in Greece'', his penultimate book, Havelock recalls being struck by a discrepancy between the language used by the philosophers he was studying and the heavily [[Plato]]nic idiom with which it was interpreted in the standard texts.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted and summarized in Swearingen, Jan, "Oral Hermeneutics during the Transition to Literacy: The Contemporary Debate" (''Cultural Anthropology'' Vol. 1 No. 2 [1986], 138–56), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; It was well known that some of these philosophical texts (Parmenides, Empedocles) were written not only in verse but in the metre of [[Homer]], who had recently been identified (still controversially at the time) by [[Milman Parry]] as an [[oral poetry|oral poet]], but Cornford and other scholars of these early philosophers saw the practice as a fairly insignificant convention left over from [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornford regards philosophy per se as a distinctly post-Hesiodic invention; he says of Anaximander, "We seem to have left the supernatural behind and to have passed at one step into the shining air of reason" (Cornford, ''From Religion to Philosophy: A Study in the Origins of Western Speculation'' [originally published 1912; reprinted Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 1991], 41).&lt;/ref&gt; Havelock eventually came to the conclusion that the poetic aspects of early philosophy "were matters not of style but of substance,"&lt;ref&gt;''Literate Revolution,'' quoted in Swearingen 141.&lt;/ref&gt; and that such thinkers as [[Heraclitus]] and [[Empedocles]] actually have more in common even on an intellectual level with Homer than they do with Plato and [[Aristotle]]. However, he did not publicly break from Cornford until many years later.

In 1926 Havelock took his first academic job at [[Acadia University]] in Nova Scotia, Canada. He married Ellen Parkinson in 1927, and moved on to [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria College]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1929. Havelock's scholarly work during this period focused on [[Latin poetry]], particularly [[Catullus]], far from the early Greek philosophy he had worked on at Cambridge. While in Canada Havelock became increasingly involved in [[politics of Canada|politics]]. With his fellow academics [[Frank Underhill]] and [[Eugene Forsey]], Havelock was a cofounder of the [[League for Social Reconstruction]], an organisation of politically active socialist intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;King, Carol, Guide to the Eric Alfred Havelock Papers, Yale University Archives (&lt;[http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/mssa.ms.1489]&gt;, accessed 12 February 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; He and Underhill were also the most outspoken of a group of dissident faculty members at the University.

Havelock's political engagement deepened rapidly. In 1931, after [[Toronto]] police had blocked a public meeting by an organisation the police claimed was associated with communists, he and Underhill wrote a public letter of protest, calling the action "short-sighted, inexpedient, and intolerable."&lt;ref&gt;Friedland, Martin, ''The University of Toronto: A History'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002) 318.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter led to considerable tension between the leadership of the university and the activist professors led by Havelock and Underhill,&lt;ref&gt;Friedland 320&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a sharply critical public reaction. All of the major newspapers in Toronto, along with a number of prominent business leaders, denounced the professors as radical leftists and their behaviour as unbecoming of academics.&lt;ref&gt;Massolin, Philip, ''Canadian Intellectuals, the Tory Tradition, and the Challenge of Modernity, 1939–1970'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001), 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the League for Social Reconstruction began as more of a discussion group than a political party, it became a force in Canadian politics by the mid-1930s. After Havelock joined the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]], along with several other members of the League, he was pressured by his superiors at the University to curtail his political activity.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, Michiel. "Professors in the Public Eye: Canadian Universities, Academic Freedom, and the League for Social Reconstruction" (''History of Education Quarterly,'' Vol. 20, No. 4. [1980], 425–47)433.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not, continuing to act as an ally and occasional spokesman for Underhill and other leftist professors. He found himself in trouble again in 1937 after criticising both the government's and industry's handling of an automotive workers' strike. Despite calls from [[Ontario]] officials for his ouster, he was able to remain at Victoria College, but his public reputation was badly damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Tudiver, Neil, ''Universities for Sale: Resisting Corporate Control Over Canadian Higher Education'' (Toronto: James Lorimer, 1999), 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Toronto, Havelock began formulating his theory of orality and literacy, establishing the context of a later movement at the University interested in the critical study of communication, which Donald F. Theall has called the "Toronto School of Communications."&lt;ref name="Theall"&gt;Theall, "The Toronto School of Communications" &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fivebodied.com/the_toronto_school_of_communications.rtf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927014108/http://www.fivebodied.com/the_toronto_school_of_communications.rtf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Havelock's work was complemented by that of [[Harold Innis]], who was working on the history of [[Media studies|media]]. The work Havelock and Innis began in the 1930s was the preliminary basis for the influential theories of communication developed by [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Edmund Snow Carpenter]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Theall"/&gt;

During [[World War II]], Havelock moved away from the socialist organisations he had been associated with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the [[Ontario Classical Association]]. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief effort for [[Greece]], which had just been liberated from [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Nazi control]].&lt;ref&gt;Curchin, Leonard A., "A Brief History of the Ontario Classical Association" (Ontario Classical Association website, &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontclassics.org/index_files/Page365.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918060057/http://www.ontclassics.org/index_files/Page365.htm |archivedate=18 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;, accessed 26 February 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Havelock continued to write about politics, however, and his political and academic work came together in his ideas about education; he argued for the necessity of an understanding of [[rhetoric]] for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Gorak, Jan. Introduction to ''Northrop Frye on Modern Culture'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2003), xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toward a new theory of Greek intellectual history==
[[Image:NAMA Alphabet grec.jpg|thumb|alt=underside of a painted cup|[[Attica|Attic]] cup inscribed with the [[Greek alphabet]]. Havelock argued that the simplicity and spacing of the alphabet was crucial to the development of literate culture.]]

At the same time that he was becoming increasingly vocal and visible in politics, Havelock's scholarly work was moving toward the concerns that would occupy him for the bulk of his career. The first questions he raised about the relationship between literacy and orality in Greece concerned the nature of the historical [[Socrates]], which was a long-debated issue. Havelock's position, drawn from analyses of [[Xenophon]] and [[Aristophanes]] as well as [[Plato]] himself, was that Plato's presentation of his teacher was largely a fiction, and intended to be a transparent one, whose purpose was to represent indirectly Plato's own ideas.&lt;ref name="Teaching"&gt;Havelock, Eric Alfred, "The Evidence for the Teaching of Socrates" (''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association,'' Vol. 65. [1934], 282–95), 283.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued vociferously against the idea associated with [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]], which still had currency at the time, that the basic model for the [[theory of forms]] originated with Socrates. Havelock's argument drew on evidence for a historical change in Greek philosophy; Plato, he argued, was fundamentally writing about the ideas of his present, not of the past.&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching of Socrates" 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Most earlier work in the field had assumed that, since Plato uses Socrates as his mouthpiece, his own philosophical concerns must have been similar to those debated in the [[Athens]] of his youth, when Socrates was his teacher. Havelock's contention that Socrates and Plato belonged to different philosophical eras was the first instance of one that would become central to his work: that a basic shift in the kinds of ideas being discussed by intellectuals, and the methods of discussing them, happened at some point between the end of the fifth century BC and the middle of the fourth.&lt;ref name="Teaching"/&gt;

In 1947, Havelock moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to take a position at [[Harvard University]], where he remained until 1963. He was active in a number of aspects of the University and of the department, of which he became chair; he undertook a translation of and commentary on [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' for the benefit of his students.  He published this translation, with an extended commentary on [[Prometheus]] and the myth's implications for history, under the title ''The Crucifixion of Intellectual Man'' (and then changed it back to ''Prometheus'' when the book was republished in the 1960s, saying that the earlier title had "come to seem a bit pretentious"&lt;ref&gt;Havelock, ''Prometheus'' [Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1968], 6.&lt;/ref&gt;). During this time he began his first major attempt to argue for a division between Platonic or Aristotelian philosophy and what came before. His focus was on [[political philosophy]] and, in particular, the beginnings of Greek liberalism as introduced by [[Democritus]]. In his book ''The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics'', he argued that for Democritus and the liberals, political theory was based on an understanding of "the behaviour of man in a cosmic and historical setting":&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;''The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics,'' quoted in Larsen, J. A. O., "Liberalism in Greek Politics" (''The Philosophical Review'' Vol. 68 No. 1 [1959], 103–09), 105.&lt;/ref&gt; that is, humanity defined as the poets would define it—measured through its individual actions. Plato and Aristotle were interested in the nature of humanity and, in particular, the idea that human actions might be rooted in inherent qualities rather than consisting of individual choices.&lt;ref name="Larsen"/&gt;

In arguing for a basic [[heuristic]] split between Plato and the contemporaries of Democritus, Havelock was directly contradicting a very long tradition in philosophy that had painstakingly assembled innumerable connections between Plato and the pre-Socratics, to reinforce the position that Plato, as his own dialogues imply, was primarily informed by his teacher Socrates, and that Socrates in turn was a willing participant in a philosophical conversation already several hundred years old (again, with a seeming endorsement from Plato, who shows a young Socrates conversing with and learning from the pre-Socratics [[Parmenides]] and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] in his dialogue the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''—a historical impossibility that might represent figuratively an intellectual rather than direct conversation).&lt;ref&gt;The idea that Plato uses the dialogues to place himself within existing philosophical "lines" has been much discussed, before and after Havelock; for discussion of the Parmenidean or Eleatic line see Mitchell H. Miller, ''Plato's'' Parmenides: ''The Conversion of the Soul'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986), 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was intriguing to many philosophers but was poorly received among some classicists, with one reviewer calling Havelock's argument for basic difference between Plato and the pre-Socratics "a failure" and his analysis of Plato and Aristotle "distortion."&lt;ref&gt;Larsen 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Some problems have persisted in research of Greek literacy, and in the main, the interest in continuing the line of research has been sustained in recent works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oral Tradition &amp; Written Record in Classical Athens|last=Thomas|first=Rosalind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=0-521-35025-5|location=Great Britain|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literacy and Orality in Ancient Greece|last=Thomas|first=Rosalind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-521-37742-0|location=Great Britain|pages=31-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literacy and Paideia in Ancient Greece|last=Robb|first=Kevin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-19-505905-0|location=New York, USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Plato's Dialogues: The Dialogical Approach|last=Hart &amp; Tejera eds.|first=|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Lewiston Maine|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Preface to Plato''==
[[File:Platon Cave Sanraedam 1604.jpg|thumb|alt=engraving showing men arguing over a silhouette in a cave|A seventeenth-century illustration of Plato's allegory of the cave.]]

''The Liberal Temper'' makes the argument for the division between Plato and early Greek philosophy without a fully realised account of Havelock's theory of Greek literacy, which he was still developing throughout this period.&lt;ref&gt;Havelock says in the introduction to ''Preface to Plato'' that he arrived at his understanding of Plato's view of oral poetry relatively late (''Preface to Plato'' [see [[Eric A. Havelock#Major works|Major works]]] x).&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than attempting once again to explain his distinction between 5th- and 4th-century BC thought in terms of a dissection of the earlier school, Havelock turned, in his 1963 ''Preface to Plato'', to 4th-century BC philosophy itself. He was interested principally in Plato's much debated rejection of poetry in the ''[[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]]'', in which his fictionalised Socrates argues that poetic [[mimesis]]—the representation of life in art—is bad for the soul. Havelock's claim was that the ''Republic'' can be used to understand the position of poetry in the "history of the Greek mind."&lt;ref&gt;''Preface to Plato'' 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided into two parts, the first an exploration of [[orality|oral culture]] (and what Havelock thinks of as oral thought), and the second an argument for what Havelock calls "The Necessity of Platonism" (the title of Part 2): the intimate relationship between Platonic thought and the development of literacy. Instead of concentrating on the philosophical definitions of key terms, as he had in his book on Democritus, Havelock turned to the Greek language itself, arguing that the meaning of words changed after the full development of written literature to admit a self-reflective subject; even [[pronoun]]s, he said, had different functions. The result was a universal shift in what the Greek mind could imagine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We confront here a change in the Greek language and in the syntax of linguistic usage and in the overtones of certain key words which is part of a larger intellectual revolution, which affected the whole range of the Greek cultural experience ... Our present business is to connect this discovery with that crisis in Greek culture which saw the replacement of an orally memorised tradition by a quite different system of instruction and education, and which therefore saw the Homeric state of mind give way to the Platonic.&lt;ref&gt;''Preface to Plato'' 198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Havelock, Plato's rejection of poetry was merely the realisation of a cultural shift in which he was a participant.

Two distinct phenomena are covered by the shift he observed in Greek culture at the end of the 5th century: the content of thought (in particular the concept of man or of the soul), and the organisation of thought. In Homer, Havelock argues, the order of ideas is associative and temporal. The epic's "units of meaning ... are linked associatively to form an episode, but the parts of the episode are greater than the whole."&lt;ref&gt;''Preface to Plato'' 185.&lt;/ref&gt; For Plato, on the other hand, the purpose of thought is to arrive at the significance of the whole, to move from the specific to the general. Havelock points out that Plato's [[syntax]], which he shares with other 4th-century writers, reflects that organisation, making smaller ideas subordinate to bigger ideas. Thus, the Platonic [[theory of forms]] in itself, Havelock claims, derives from a shift in the organisation of the Greek language, and ultimately comes down to a different function for and conception of the [[noun]].&lt;ref&gt;''Preface to Plato'' 269–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Preface to Plato'' had a profound impact almost immediately after publication, but an impact that was complex and inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Early reviews ranged from that of Friedrich Solmsen, who concludes that Havelock "play[s] fast and loose with the evidence" (''The American Journal of Philology'' 87.1 [1966], 105), to Robert Wellman's view that the book is "an excellent example of how historical scholarship not only informs the history of philosophy but blends imperceptibly into it" (Wellman, "Plato on Education: Philosopher and Dramatist?," ''History of Education Quarterly,'' 10.3 [1970], 357).&lt;/ref&gt; The book's claims refer to the ideas of a number of different fields: the study (then fairly new) of oral literature as well as Greek philosophy and Greek [[philology]]; the book also acknowledges the influence of [[literary theory]], particularly [[structuralism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Preface to Plato'' 140–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s were a period in which those fields were growing further apart, and the reaction to ''Preface'' from each of them was starkly different. Among classicists the response ranged from indifference to derision, with the majority simply questioning the details of Havelock's history of literacy, pointing both to earlier instances of writing than Havelock thinks possible or to later instances of oral influence.&lt;ref&gt;Halverson, John, "Havelock on Greek Orality and Literacy," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' Vol. 53, No. 1 [1992], 148–63), 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy, particularly Platonic scholarship, was moving in a different direction at the time, and Havelock neither engages nor was cited by the principal movers in that field. However, the book was embraced by literary theorists, students of the transition to literacy, and others in fields as diverse as [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Halverson"&gt;Halverson 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been affirmations and criticism of Havelock's methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and Thought in Early Greek Philosophy|last=Robb|first=Kevin|publisher=The Monist Library of Philosophy|year=1983|isbn=0-914417-01-0|location=Illinois, US|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literacy &amp; Paideia in Ancient Greece|last=Robb|first=Kevin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-19-505-905-0|location=NY, USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His account of orality is based almost entirely on Homer, but the history of the Homeric text is not known, which forces Havelock to make claims based on assumptions that cannot fully be tested.&lt;ref&gt;Halverson 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[Milman Parry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Making_of_Homeric_Verse.html?id=cbvyswUgSnEC|title=The Collected Papers of Milman Parry|last=Parry|first=Milman|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=New York USA|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Homer were instrumental in developing the orientation to his work, and the breakthrough sustained research which Havelock prepared. The "Parry-Lord thesis" was introduced by Rosalind Thomas, to clarify the import of this approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some later classicists argue that the poetic nature of Homer's language works against the very arguments Havelock makes about the intellectual nature of oral poetry. What he asserts as a definitive use of language can never be conclusively demonstrated not to be an accident of "metrical convenience."&lt;ref&gt;Halverson 157&lt;/ref&gt; Homerists, like Platonists, found the book to be less than useful for the precise work of their own discipline; many classicists rejected outright Havelock's essential thesis that oral culture predominated through the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Hoerber complains in a review of the book of Havelock's "rapid dismissal" of the evidence of earlier writing, and feels that "the present work will meet with even less acceptance than the author's previous volume" (''Classical Philology'' 59.1 [1964], 74).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, though, Havelock's influence, particularly in literary theory, was growing enormously. He is the most cited writer in Walter J. Ong's influential ''Orality and Literacy'' other than Ong himself.&lt;ref name="Halverson"/&gt; His work has been cited in studies of orality and literacy in African culture and the implications of modern literacy theory for [[library science]].&lt;ref&gt;Biakolo, E. A., "On the Theoretical Foundations of Orality and Literacy" (''Research in African Literatures'' Vol. 30, No. 2 [1999], 42–65)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weissinger, Thomas, "The New Literacy Thesis: Implications for Librarianship" (''Libraries and the Academy'' Vol. 4, No. 2 [April 2004], 245–57).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Preface to Plato'' has remained continuously in print since its initial publication.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674699069 Harvard University Press webpage for the book].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Shortly after publication of ''Preface to Plato'', Havelock accepted a position as chair of the Classics Department at [[Yale University]]. He remained in [[New Haven]] for eight years, and then taught briefly as Raymond Distinguished Professor of Classics at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;"In Memoriam: Eric Alfred Havelock," ''Classical Views'' Vol. 33 (1989), 278.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in 1973 and moved to [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], where his wife Christine Mitchell, whom he had married in 1962, taught at [[Vassar College]].&lt;ref&gt;Havelock and Jackson P. Hershbell, eds., ''Communication Arts in the Ancient World'' (New York: Hastings House, 1978), 94.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a productive scholar after his retirement, writing three books as well as numerous essays and talks expanding the arguments of ''Preface to Plato'' to a generalised argument about the effect of literacy on Greek thought, literature, culture, society, and law.

Increasingly central to Havelock's account of Greek culture in general was his conception of the [[Greek alphabet]] as a unique entity. He wrote in 1977:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The invention of the Greek alphabet, as opposed to all previous systems, including the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], constituted an event in the history of human culture, the importance of which has not as yet been fully grasped. Its appearance divides all pre-Greek civilisations from those that are post-Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Havelock, "The Preliteracy of the Greeks" (''New Literary History'' Vol. 8 No. 3 [1977], 369–91), 369.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Dipylon Inscription.JPG|thumb|Vase from c. 750–690 B.C.E., scratched with a poetic line in early versions of Greek letters]]
But his philological concerns now were only a small part of a much larger project to make sense of the nature of the Greek culture itself. His work in this period shows a [[literary theory|theoretical]] sophistication far beyond his earlier efforts, extending his theory of literacy toward a theory of culture itself. He said of the [[Dipylon inscription]], a poetic line scratched into a vase and the earliest Greek writing known at the time, "Here in this casual act by an unknown hand there is announced a revolution which was destined to change the nature of human culture."&lt;ref&gt;"Preliteracy" 378.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this larger point about the differences between oral and literate culture that represents Havelock's most influential contribution. [[Walter J. Ong]], for example, in assessing the significance of non-oral communication in an oral culture, cites Havelock's observation that scientific categories, which are necessary not only for the natural sciences but also for historical and philosophical analysis, depend on writing.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Walter J., "African Talking Drums and Oral Noetics" (''New Literary History'' Vol. 8 No. 3 [1977], 411–29.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were sketched out in ''Preface to Plato'' but became central to Havelock's work from ''Prologue to Greek Literacy'' (1971) onward.

In the latter part of his career, Havelock's relentless pursuit of his unvarying thesis led to a lack of interest in addressing opposing viewpoints. In a review of Havelock's ''The Greek Concept of Justice'', a book that attempts to ascribe the most significant ideas in Greek philosophy to his linguistic research, the philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] accuses Havelock of a "brusque refusal to recognize the substance of the case he has to defeat."&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, Alasdair, Review of ''The Greek Concept of Justice: From its Shadow in Homer to its Substance in Plato'' (''The American Historical Review'' Vol. 85 No. 3 [1980], 605).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this refusal, Havelock seems to have been caught in a conflict of mere contradiction with his opponents, in which without attempt at refutation, he simply asserts repeatedly that philosophy is fundamentally literate in nature, and is countered only with a reminder that, as MacIntyre says, "Socrates wrote no books."&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre 605&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last public lecture, which was published posthumously, Havelock addressed the political implications of his own scholarly work. Delivered at Harvard on 16 March 1988, less than three weeks before his death, the lecture is framed principally in opposition to the [[University of Chicago]] philosopher [[Leo Strauss]]. Strauss had published a detailed and extensive critique of Havelock's ''The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics''  in March 1959, as "The Liberalism of Classical Political Philosophy" in the journal ''Review of Metaphysics.''  (Strauss died 14 years later in 1973, the same year in which Havelock retired.) Havelock's 1988 lecture claims to contain a systematic account of Plato's politics; Havelock argues that Plato's idealism applies a mathematical strictness to politics, countering his old teacher Cornford's assertion that Platonic arguments that morality must be analyzable in arithmetical terms cannot be serious.&lt;ref&gt;Havelock, "Plato's Politics and the American Constitution" (''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' Vol. 93 [1990], 1–24), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This way of thinking about politics, Havelock concluded, could not be used as a model for understanding or shaping inherently nonmathematical interactions: "The stuff of human politics is conflict and compromise."&lt;ref&gt;"Plato's Politics" 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco Canals Vidal''' (30 May 1922 – 7 February 2009) was a Spanish philosopher, theologian, academic and lay Catholic activist. The longtime chair of Catedra de Metafísica of the [[University of Barcelona|Barcelona University]], he is recognized mostly as one of the most distinguished contemporary [[Thomism|Thomists]] and leader of the so-called Barcelona Thomist school; his scientific focus was mostly on metaphysics of cognition. As a [[Theology|theologian]] he specialized in theology of history and [[Josephology]], as lay Catholic he contributed to devotion to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]]. Historian of ideas and partially political theorist himself, he remained related to the [[Carlism|Carlist]] version of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]] and is considered one of its greatest contemporary masters.

The Canals family is among the best-known in [[Catalonia]]; it gained both recognition and position in the 18th century, upon co-foundation, taking over and later management of [[:es:Fábricas de indianas|Fábrica de Indianas]], one of the first major textile plants in the region.&lt;ref&gt;compare Roger Alier, ''La Fábrica d’Indianes de la familia Canals'', [in:] ''Recerques: història, economia, cultura'' 4 (1974), pp. 59-91, María Antonia Cilleruelo Uzquiza, ''Los fabricantes: su enoblecimineto. Los Canals: la fabrica de indianas. De „Payes de barón”. Otros fabricantes ennobleados'', [in:] ''Revista d'historia moderna'' 8/1 (1988), pp. 49-56&lt;/ref&gt; The first identified direct ancestor of Francisco was his great-grandfather, Bernart Canals Papell; his son and Francisco’s paternal grandfather, Emilio Canals Moret (1841-1907), was active in the [[Conservative Party (Spain)|Conservative Party]] and in 1902 entered its [[Barcelona]] Junta Ejecutiva.&lt;ref&gt;''Dinastía'' 02.02.02, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001730844&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; He married María Paz Arrieta Acuña; the couple had at least 10 children, one of them was Francisco’s father, [[Manuel Canals Arrieta]] (1877-1938). The latter married Carolina Tay Sucre&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 01.03.24, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1924/03/01/pagina-1/33266156/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and fathered one child before his wife passed away.&lt;ref&gt;''Manuel Canals Arrieta'' entry, [in:] ''MyHeritage'' genealogical service, available [https://www.myheritage.pl/names/manuel_canals%20arrieta here]&lt;/ref&gt; Remarried, he wed Manuela Vidal Cabot (1886-1973).&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 20.02.73, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1973/02/20/pagina-29/34254213/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple lived in Barcelona and had 5 children;&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 11.08.40, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1907/06/27/pagina-2/33117460/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco was born as the youngest of the siblings.&lt;ref&gt;''Biografía'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service, available [http://canals.orlandis.org/biografia/biografia/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The children were brought up in a fervently religious ambience.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Canals Arrieta was congregante de la Purificación, ''La Vanguardia'' 11.08.40&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco was first educated in the [[Piarists|Piarist]] school at calle Diputación; in 1932, already in course of his secondary education, he moved to Colegio del Sagrado Corazón, also in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;''Francisco Canals Vidal'' entry, [in:] ''filosofia.org'' service, available [http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a097.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; One source claims he frequented the college until 1939,&lt;ref&gt;''Francisco Canals Vidal'' entry, [in:] ''filosofia.org'' service&lt;/ref&gt; another one that living in the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]]-controlled Barcelona, he attended various establishments and obtained bachillerato shortly after the end of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biografía'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service&lt;/ref&gt; He first intended to study mathematics, but abandoned the curriculum shortly and in 1940 joined the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] seminar in [[Veruela]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biografía'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service&lt;/ref&gt; His novitiate lasted only few months before Canals left the Jesuits. Disoriented and unsure about his future, bowing to the pressure of own family he decided to pursue the career of a notary and in 1943 enrolled at law in the University of Barcelona. Before graduation in 1946&lt;ref&gt;''Cronología'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service, available [http://canals.orlandis.org/biografia/cronologia/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; and considering juridical studies introduction to general education, he commenced studying Philosophy and Letters; he graduated in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Ayuso, ''Un apóstol intelectual'', [in:] ''ABC'' 13.02.09, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2009/02/13/067.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s Canals assumed auxiliary teaching duties at [[Universidad de Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biografía'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal.

In 1950 Canals married Isabel Suris Fábrega; none of the sources consulted provides any information on her or her family. The couple settled in Barcelona and had 11 children.&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Martínez, ''In memoriam Francisco Canals Vidal (1922-2009)'', [in:] ''Espíritu'' LVIII (2009), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them pursued career in business or as professionals; some grew to local prominence and are known in Catalonia: Manuel Canals Suris followed in the footsteps of his father and is a philosopher and [[Anthropology|anthropologist]],&lt;ref&gt;compare his works at the ''dialnet.unirioja'' service, available [https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/autor?codigo=2679188 here], or at ''todostuslibros'' service, available [https://www.todostuslibros.com/autor/canals-suris-manuel-carlos here]&lt;/ref&gt; Francesc Canals Suris is a scientist in [[biochemistry]] and head of Proteomics Lab in the Barcelona University Hospital,&lt;ref&gt;see ''Dr. Francesc Canals Suris'' entry, [in:] ''IQS: Persona Ciencia Impresa'' service, available [http://www.iqs.edu/en/dr-francesc-canals-suris here]&lt;/ref&gt; Carme Canals Suris is a [[hematologist]].&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''XVII Jordnadas de Medicina Transfusional'' program, available [https://www.asturias.es/RecursosWeb/iaap/contenidos/Noticias/2016/Jornada_transfusion_Triptico_%202016.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; José María Canals Suris is active in politics related to Traditionalism; as a candidate of [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista (1986)|Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista]] he unsuccessfully ran for the Senate, in 2004 from [[Albacete]]&lt;ref&gt;''BOE'' 02.11.04, available [http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2004/02/11/pdfs/A06255-06343.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 from [[Girona]].&lt;ref&gt;''BOE'' 16.02.08, available [https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2008/02/16/pdfs/A08809-08811.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic==
[[File:Institut Jaume Balmes.JPG|thumb|left|[[:es:Instituto Balmes|Instituto Balmes]] (current site)]]
Having graduated in Filosofía y Letras, in the early 1950s Canals decided to dedicate himself to philosophy and commenced [[PhD|PhD research]], supervised by [[:es:Jaume Bofill Bofill|Jaime Bofill]]. His dissertation, ''El logos, ¿indigencia o plenitud?'' was accepted at the University of Madrid in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;''Francisco Canals Vidal'' entry, [in:] ''filosofia.org'' service&lt;/ref&gt; Another PhD thesis, ''Cristianismo y Revolución'', was accepted by Department of Law of the University of Barcelona in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;''Cronología'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service&lt;/ref&gt; Though he performed minor teaching roles since 1949, his attempts to land chairs of Metafísica in [[Valencia]] and Derecho Político in Barcelona proved unsuccessful, yet with the latter he was contracted out to teach teoría de conocimiento.&lt;ref&gt;''Biografía'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 he commenced teaching at [[:es:Instituto Balmes|Insituto Jaime Balmes]], a prestigious Barcelona college,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 30.04.58&lt;/ref&gt; admitted also to Cuerpo de Catedráticos Numerarios de Institutos Nacionales de Enseñanza Media.&lt;ref&gt;''Francisco Canals Vidal'' entry, [in:] ''filosofia.org'' service&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at the Institute until the mid-1960s.

Canals’ full-time employment in the Barcelona University commenced in controversial circumstances. In 1965 [[Manuel Sacristán|Manuel Sacristán Luzón]], increasingly acknowledged as key [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosopher and suspected to be member of the clandestine [[Spanish Communist Party]], did not get his contract renewed; it was Canals who took over his lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Salvador López Arnal, ''A propósito de un artículo de Alfredo Pastor Expulsiones políticas universitarias y comparaciones forzadas'', [in:] ''Rebelión'' service 26.11.15, available [http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=206114 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he assumed Cátedra de Metafísica, replacing the retired Jaime Bofill; this was the post Canals held for over 20 years, until he retired himself in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;''Biografía'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and during unspecified time he headed Departamento de Filosofía Teorética.&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario Biográfico Español Contemporáneo'', Madrid 1970, vol. 1, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s he co-founded Societá Internazionale Tommasso d’Aquino, rising to president of its Spanish section (1981-1986) and vice-president of its international executive (1991-1997);&lt;ref&gt;''Biografía'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service&lt;/ref&gt; in the meantime he obtained one more PhD, in theology.&lt;ref&gt;in 1981; he first obtained MA in theology in 1973, ''Biografía'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Canals was nominated to the Vatican-based [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas|Pontificia Academia Sancti Thomae Aquinatis]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 19.03.89, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/2009/02/08/pagina-16/33062540/pdf.htm here] l&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century he was awarded [[doctor honoris causa]] titles by universities in [[Manila]], [[Mar del Plata]] and the [[Abat Oliba CEU University|Barcelona Universidad CEU]].&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Martínez, ''In memoriam Francisco Canals Vidal (1922-2009)'', [in:] ''Espíritu'' LVIII (2009), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Canals was active as lecturer also beyond the scholarly realm.&lt;ref&gt;he was first noted as lectures in 1949, speaking at Curso de Antropología Católica ran by Hermandad de San Cosme y San Damian, ''Hoja Oficial de la Provincia de Barcelona'' 07.03.49, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1000224325&amp;presentacion=pagina here]; in the 1960s Canals was lecturing e.g. in "Balmesiana" and in collaboration with Schola Cordis Jesu, ''Hoja Oficial de la Provincia de Barcelona'' 05.12.60, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=8&amp;path=1000224938&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Universitat P1380066.jpg|thumb|[[University of Barcelona]]]]
Canals approached his academic duties as service to science and religion; he saw no incompatibility in search of scientific truth and in missionary, apostolic attitude. He considered the two highly inter-related and passionately pursued both, hardly adhering to dispassionate, detached teaching formula; his lectures are recorded for precise logic, but also for fervor and animation.&lt;ref&gt;"Los que han sido sus alumnos recordarán siempre la fuerza de sus clases. Al entrar en el aula, el profesor Canals se transformaba, y de una cierta apariencia de timidez pasaba a hablar tamquam potestatem habens, con tal fuerza y energía que incluso asustaba a los que no eran capaces de fijarse en la esencia de lo que estaba diciendo. En efecto, el dr. Canals vibraba todo él al unísono de la materia que exponía, cuestión por cuestión, idea por idea, pues se entregaba con toda su alma a la comunicación de la verdad y la debelación del error", ''Biografía'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service&lt;/ref&gt; When replacing Sacristán, Canals claimed he accepted the job "to save students from eternal fire", to which they were exposed following frequenting lectures of his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;at least according to later recollections, López Arnal 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The students went on strike and Canals narrowly missed physical assault, lambasted later for "su franquista y más que autoritaria y reaccionaria presencia" and for placing a crucifix on the wall of the lecture room.&lt;ref&gt;López Arnal 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s he was already an icon of rotten reaction; during the 1971 riots hundreds of students invaded his office&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 27.03.71, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1971/03/27/pagina-31/34295541/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and later boasted of expelling a reactionary from the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;López Arnal 2015, ''La Vanguardia'' 01.04.71&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Spanish transition to democracy|transición]] Canals was particularly alarmed by de-Christianization of universities and remained determined to confront the rising Marxist tide,&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal, ''Encuentro con estudiantes'', [in:] ''Verbo'' 153-154 (1977), pp. 411-418&lt;/ref&gt; anxious that [[Partido Comunista de Espana|PCE]] infiltrated the academic realm in pursuit of its revolutionary goals.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 03.13.76, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1976/03/13/036.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Also later he kept denouncing subversive activities&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 20.05.76, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1976/05/20/030.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and tried to prevent marginalisation of religion and faith in the University.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 25.07.78, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1978/07/25/071.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosopher==
[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Aquinas]]]]
Canals’ interest in philosophy was triggered by [[:es:Ramón Orlandis Despuig|Ramón Orlandis Despuig]], a Catholic priest and philosopher he met in the mid-1940s; their 15-year-long intellectual co-operation and personal friendship formatted Canals as a Thomist.&lt;ref&gt;''Biografía'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service&lt;/ref&gt; Another personality which contributed to his formation was Jaime Bofill Bofill, also Orlandis’ disciple and his successor as leader of the emergent so-called [[:es:Escuela tomista de Barcelona|escuela tomista de Barcelona]]. It was Canals who took over from Bofill in the mid-1960s; he headed the informal group for the next 40 years and became a master for its later representatives, [[:es:José María Petit Sullá|José María Petit]], [[:es:José María Alsina Roca|José María Alsina]], Antonio Prevosti, Margarita Mauri, Ignacio Guiu, José María Romero, Francisca Tomar, Misericordia Anglés, [[:es:Eudaldo Forment|Eudaldo Forment]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Eudaldo Forment Giralt, ''Historia de la filosofía tomista en la España ontemporánea'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|8474904919}}, p. 47, José Escandell, ''Francisco Canals, in memoriam'', [in:] ''Diarioya.es'' service, 14.02.09&lt;/ref&gt;

Canals’ contribution to philosophy is spanned in-between [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]], its three major threads being "la metafísica del conocimiento, la metafísica del ser y la metafísica de la persona";&lt;ref&gt;Forment Giralt 1998, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; the key area of interest was the theory of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;detailed discussion in Alberto Caturelli, ''La obra de Francisco Canals Vidal sobre el conocimiento'', [in:] ''Convivium'' 2 (1991), pp. 151-160&lt;/ref&gt; However, his opus is generally credited for providing a multi-faceted synthesis of Thomism, perhaps the latest one available globally to date. Most original Canals’ input to understanding of Thomism is a theory of "thinking realism",&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Martínez, ''Realismo pensante. La metafísica del conocimiento en Francisco Canals'', [in:] ''Annuario Filosófico'' XLIII/3 (2010), pp. 471-476&lt;/ref&gt; a concept which examines relation between a human and transcendency by discussing integrity of the act of being and the act of knowing,&lt;ref&gt;one scholar refers to it as "duplex esse", Martín Federico Echavarría, ''"Esse et intelligere" en Tomás de Aquino según el “realismo pensante” de Francisco Canals Vidal'', [in:] ''Revista portuguesa de filosofía'' 71/2-3 (2015), p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; the latter manifestive and locutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez 2010, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; It is combined with and supported by the focus on praecognitia, cognitive properties of a human;&lt;ref&gt;Forment Giralt 1998, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; substantialist approach to a person is one more characteristic feature of Canals’ discourse,&lt;ref&gt;Forment Giralt 1998, pp. 468-474&lt;/ref&gt; combined with his general vision of "humanismo teocéntrico".&lt;ref&gt;Forment Giralt 1998, p. 481-493&lt;/ref&gt; Another thread marking Canals’ innovative approach to Thomism is certain detachment of analysis from the traditional [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and neo-scholastic orthodoxy and defining the concept in discourse with thought grounded in [[Kantian]] and [[Hegelian]] approach. Far from seeking common ground, Canals seeks to demonstrate robustness of Aquinas’ opus as capable of confronting and overcoming perceived limitations of modern thought.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Vallet de Goytisolo, ''Francisco Canals Vidal: recuerdos de una amistad'', [in:] ''Verbo'' 473-474 (2009), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Francisceumsbibliothek Thomas Aquinas.JPG|thumb|''[[Summa Theologica]]'']]
Canals’ philosophical treaty which stands out and should be listed first is definitely his ''Sobre la esencia del conocimiento'' (1987), a massive&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal, ''Sobre la esencia del conocimiento'', Barcelona 1987, {{ISBN|9788476651537}}, 699 pages&lt;/ref&gt; study discussing epistemology from the Thomist perspective, described by some as "the book which makes history".&lt;ref&gt;Vallet de Goytisolo 2009, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; A more synthetic work on [[Aquinas]], gathering most of earlier threads and summarized by the end of Canals’ life, is ''Tomás de Aquino. Un pensamiento siempre actual y renovador'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal, ''Tomás de Aquino. Un pensamiento siempre actual y renovador'', Barcelona 2004, {{ISBN|9788493392574}}, 350 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Two earlier works, more compact and the latter partly repetitive, are ''Para una fundamentación de la metafísica'' (1967)&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal, ''Para una fundamentación de la metafísica'', Barcelona 1967, 238 pages&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Cuestiones de fundamentación'' (1981),&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal, ''Cuestiones de fundamentación'', Barcelona 1981, {{ISBN|8475280048}}, 227 pages&lt;/ref&gt; apart from minor works scattered across specialized reviews. Canals’ Thomist opus is complete with an [[anthology]] he edited, ''Sant Tomàs d’Aquino. Antología metafísica'' (1991), to which he added two other anthologies of contemporary (1974) and medieval (1975) philosophical texts, both reprinted a few times throughout the following two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal (ed.), ''Textos filosóficos de la Edad contemporánea'', Barcelona 1974 (4th edition 1990), Francisco Canals Vidal (ed.) ''Textos filosóficos de la Edad media'', Barcelona 1975, (4th edition 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The work which enjoyed most popularity, however, is tailored as a textbook for philosophy students; ''Historia de la filosofía medieval'' (1976) was re-issued 4 times until the early 1990s.

==Theologian==
[[File:Batoni sacred heart.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Sacred Heart]] by [[Pompeo Batoni|Batoni]]]]
Since his encounter with father Orlandis Canals’ interest was divided mostly between philosophy and theology. He perceived the latter not as a speculative exercise but as a discursive science, subject to usual rational verification procedures yet remaining in the service of Roman Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;''Pensamiento teológico'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service, available [http://canals.orlandis.org/pensamiento/teologico/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; His opus falls largely into two branches, dogmatic theology and historical theology. Since the late 1960s he was increasingly recognized as authority by a number of Catholic institutions and organizations. Among the Spanish Traditionalist intellectuals he was perhaps the one least skeptical about [[Vaticanum II]]&lt;ref&gt;compare e.g. his ''„Aggiornamento” y „obediencia”'', [in:] ''Cristiandad'' 414-415 (1965), pp. 165-166, ''Al termino de la II sesion conciliar'', [in:] ''Cristiandad'' 394 (1963), pp. 257-258 ''„Concilio de renovación”'', [in:] ''Cristiandad'' 391 (1963), pp. 185-186&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards remained firmly within the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]-defined orthodoxy. This was certified by the 1998 nomination to St. Thomas’ Academy&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 19.03.89, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/2009/02/08/pagina-16/33062540/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2002 honor of commander of [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|Ordo Sancti Gregorii Magni]], both conferred upon him by [[John Paul II]]; Canals was personally appreciated by the Pope and in his writings explored a number of concepts coined earlier by [[Karol Wojtyła]].&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''La actualidad del pensamiento de santo Tomás, reafirmada por Juan Pablo II'', [in:] ''Cristiandad'' 586-587 (1980), ''Presencia de san José en el pontificado de Juan Pablo II'', [in:] ''Cristiandad'' 871 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of doctrine Canals’ efforts were multifold. Chronologically the first dogma he tackled and examined throughout most of his life was this of the Sacred Heart of Jesus;&lt;ref&gt;he was longtime member of Internacional Institute of the Heart of Jesús, Vallet de Goytisolo 2009, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; however, he then focused on a number of [[Mariology of the Catholic Church|Mariologist]] and [[Christology|Christologist]] dogmas. Two threads which emerged as "más caracteristicos" of his study are theology of history and Josephology. The former, anchored in the vision of earthly Rule of Christ as the ultimate goal, is somewhat opposed to earlier [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] concepts yet advances their modified version, dubbed by scholars "milenarismo mitigado" or "milenarismo político".&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Prevosti Vives, ''La teología de la historia según Francisco Canals Vidal'', [in:] ''Academia.edu'' service, pp. 6-7; detailed discussion in Xavier Prevosti Vives, ''La teología de la historia según Francisco Canals Vidal'', Barcelona 2015, {{ISBN|9788421006825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephological studies are related to the concept of "spiritual infancy", reportedly represented by St. Joseph, his position of a role model and its implications for apostolate of the lay; other associated threads are those referring to marital relations, virginity and St. Joseph’s position in the [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostatic]] order.&lt;ref&gt;''Pensamiento teológico'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of history of theology Canals dedicated most his attention to Aquinas and the early [[Medieval]] thought. Tracing evolution of the doctrine from the 4th to the 8th century he acknowledges political and socio-cultural background, yet he evades reductionism and claims that the process of formulating the Catholic doctrine was powered mostly by fidelity to key dogmas.&lt;ref&gt;Alvaro Fernandez de Cordoba, ''Francisco Canals Vidal Los siete primeros concilios. La formulación de la ortodoxia católica'' [review], [in:] ''Annuario de Historia de la Iglesia'' 14 (2005), p. 519&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Canals&amp;JuanPabloII.jpg|thumb|Canals and John Paul II, 1989]]
Of Canals’ written theological output the Josephologist thread is treated most extensively; it was dedicated two books, a lengthy ''San José, Patriarca del Pueblo de Dios'' (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal, ''San José, Patriarca del Pueblo de Dios'', Barcelona 1982, {{ISBN|8421004891}}, 453 pages&lt;/ref&gt; and an anthology of texts on St. Joseph, titled ''San José en la fe de la Iglesia'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal (ed.), ''San José en la fe de la Iglesia'', Barcelona 2007, {{ISBN|9788479148836}}, 304 pages&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mundo histórico y Reino de Dios'' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal,''Mundo histórico y Reino de Dios'', Barcelona 2006, {{ISBN|9788493392543}}, 232 pages&lt;/ref&gt; is a lecture in theology of history, while ''Los siete primeros concilios. La formulación de la ortodoxia católica'' (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal, ''Los siete primeros concilios. La formulación de la ortodoxia católica'', Barcelona 2003, {{ISBN|9788493323110}}, 205 pages&lt;/ref&gt; discusses evolution of the early Catholic doctrine. The work which falls into none of the fields discussed earlier is ''En torno al diálogo católico-protestante'' (1966); written in course of Vaticanum II it advanced a somewhat competitive approach towards ecumenism and claimed that stress on components unifying Christian faiths comes at a cost of de-emphasizing the core message.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Guy, ''Historia de la filosofía española'', Madrid 1985, {{ISBN|9788485887873}}, p. 400. Canals’ concern was already expressed in 1962, when the council was about to begin, see his ''El Vaticano II ante los protestantes'', [in:] ''Cristiandad'' 379 (1962), pp. 209-212&lt;/ref&gt; Last but not least, for more than half a century Canals contributed to a number of Catholic reviews,&lt;ref&gt;''Verbo'', ''Convivium'' and ''Espíritu'', Vallet de Goytisolo 2009, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; mostly ''Cristiandad'', and remained in its editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;''Francisco Canals Vidal'' entry, [in:] ''filosofia.org'' service&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historian==
[[File:Reinaré en España.jpg|thumb|160px|left|''I will rule over Spain'']]
Historiography formed a secondary yet visible section of Canals’ writings. He remained almost exclusively a historian of ideas. In terms of timeframe, he tended to focus on the [[Modern history#Late modern period|late modern period]], in terms of geography he tended to focus on [[Catalonia]], Spain and the [[Hispanic]] realm, and in terms of key threads he tended to focus on confrontation between traditional structures and the challenges of [[Enlightenment in Spain|Enlightenment]], [[Absolutism (European history)|Absolutism]], [[French Revolution|Revolution]], [[Romanticism]] and [[Liberalism in Spain|Liberalism]]. Armed with his general theological vision of history,&lt;ref&gt;detailed discussion in Javier Barrayvoa Martínez, ''La Teología de la historia en Francisco Canals'', [in:] ''Espiritu'' LXI/144 (2012), pp. 377-384, Xavier Prevosti Vives, ''La teología de la historia según Francisco Canals Vidal'', Barcelona 2015, {{ISBN|9788421006825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canals discusses mounting feeling of perceived discontinuity between the past and the present, mostly against the background of 18th-19th century [[Romance languages|Romance]]-speaking Europe, and the efforts to bridge the gap, leading to birth of Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de Gomis, ''Prólogo a la segunda edición'',[in:] Francisco Canals, ''Cristianismo y revolución'', Madrid 1986, {{ISBN|9788473440288}}, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Its key opponent is defined as Liberal Catholicism, examined at length as it developed and adopted itself to changing political circumstances;&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Ayuso, ''Ideologia romantica y catolicismo de izquierda'', [in:] ''Verbo'' 252-252 (1987), pp. 65-75&lt;/ref&gt; confrontation of the two is presented mostly in the Spanish setting though at times reaching also to a broader European milieu, e.g. in case of [[France]] covering also royalism of the [[Restoration (French history)|Restoration]], monarchist legitimism or [[Ultramontanism]] of the later era.&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, ''Nada sin Díos. Społeczne Królestwo Chrystusa jako sens i cel kontrrewolucji'', [in:] ''legitymizm.org'' service, available [http://www.legitymizm.org/nada-sin-dios here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the currently prevailing view, Canals advances a thesis that the modern Catalan identity was forged as part of traditional Christian response to competitive universalist concepts gaining ground since the late 17th century and usually imported from the other side of the Pyrenees.&lt;ref&gt;Josep M. Mundet i Gifre, ''Francisco Canals y la tradición catalana. En la estela de Torras i Bages'', [in:] ''Cristiandad'' 932 (2009), pp. 10-20&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the [[War of the Spanish Succession|anti-Borbonic war of 1705-1714]] - the theory goes - the Catalan political self was being built; the process gained pace and in fact was most dramatically expressed in a series of 7 counter-revolutionary wars, fought by the Catalans between 1794 and 1876: [[War of the Pyrenees|Guerra Gran]], [[Peninsular War|the War of Independence]], [[:es:Guerra Realista|Guerra Realista]], [[:es:Guerra de los Agraviados|Guerra de los Agraviados]], the [[First Carlist War]], [[Second Carlist War|Guerra dels Matiners]] and the [[Third Carlist War]]. Within the perspective offered, advances of the bourgeoisie-driven Liberalism gave rise to a new concept of Catalanism, which in fact is de-construction rather than re-construction of a Catalan self. Being a local copy of European nationalisms, it reportedly discards constitutive features of Catalan identity and leads to "Cataluña sin alma y sin vida".&lt;ref&gt;Juan B. Vallet de Goytisolo, ''Una reflexiones sobre Cataluña del Prof. Francisco Canals Vidal: Catalanismo y tradición catalana'', [in:] ''Verbo'' 441-442 (2006), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sitio-barcelona-11-septiembre-1714.jpg|thumb|Barcelona, [[National Day of Catalonia|September 11, 1714]]]]
Canals’ historiographic writings are mostly essays, scattered across various periodicals, usually ''Cristiandad'', and later gathered together in compact volumes. The first major work published was his scaled down PhD thesis ''Cristianismo y revolución: los orígenes románticos del cristianismo de izquierdas'' (1957);&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal, ''Cristianismo y revolución: los orígenes románticos del cristianismo de izquierdas'', Barcelona 1957, 212 pages&lt;/ref&gt; the work was centred on [[Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais|Felicite de Lammenais]], considered one of the founding fathers of Liberal Catholicism. Almost 40 years later Canals published ''La tradición catalana en el siglo XVIII: ante el absolutismo y la Ilustración'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal, ''La tradición catalana en el siglo XVIII: ante el absolutismo y la Ilustración'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|9788492073917}}, 277 pages&lt;/ref&gt; the work discussing birth of Catalan Traditionalism as response to new ideas imported from France. A minor ''Miscelánea'' (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal, ''Miscelánea'', Barcelona 1997, {{ISBN|8421006282}}, 272 pages&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by ''Catalanismo y tradición catalana'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Canals Vidal, ''Catalanismo y tradición catalana'', Barcelona 2005, {{ISBN|8493392553}}, 152 pages&lt;/ref&gt; a booklet which contained a set of 8 essays, focused on history of Catalan identity.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Los hechos del 11 de septiembre de 1714'', ''Los orígenes románticos del catalanismo'', ''La Cataluña que pelea contra Europa, Sugerencias sobre "La Tradición catálana”, La acción de Torras i Bages. Inculturación de la fé católica en Cataluña, Catalanismo y Tradición catalana, Una reflexión actual sobre el 11 de septiembre, Meditación sobre Cataluña''; most were published earlier in ''Cristiandad''&lt;/ref&gt; Some volumes of the currently issued ''Obras Completas'' series are supposed to re-publish historiographic Canals’ writings.&lt;ref&gt;''Indice general'', [in:] ''Francisco Canals Vidal. Al servicio del Reinado del Sagrado Corazón'' service, available [http://canals.orlandis.org/obras-completas/indice-general/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between Traditionalism and Carlism==
[[File:Zumalacarregui.PNG|thumb|180px|left|[[Zumalacarregui]]]]
Canals did not engage openly in politics, be it in terms of joining any party or competing for posts of power. He is hardly known for speaking on issues related to ongoing politics; the exception was signing a letter of 61 intellectuals, who in 1978 voiced against [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|the constitution draft]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, ''Nic bez boga, nic wbrew tradycji'', Radzymin 2015, {{ISBN|9788360748732}}, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that by ignoring God and elevating the people to ultimate authority, capable of telling the good from the evil, the document advanced an unacceptable "secular totalitarianism".&lt;ref&gt;''El carlismo es el tradicionalismo histórico español'', [in:] ''Hispanidad'' service, available [http://www.hispanidad.info/tradicarlismocanals.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; Canals’ ''Política española: pasado y futuro'' (1977) is a collection of essays on general "filosofía política"; they discuss a number of political concepts yet fall short of advocating specific solutions.&lt;ref&gt;titled e.g. ''La doctrina de la Iglesia sobre los deberes religiosos del Estado, „Derechismo”, Sobre la actualidad de una actitud antiliberal, Dios no es nunca neutral, El mesianismo progresista y la esperanza cristiana, Monismo y pluralismo en la vida social, Diálogo y dialéctica, Dialéctica y esperanza, Absolutismo y democracia, La tentación de la antítesis maniquea. Reflexiones de actualidad, La derecha como rectitud política, La filosofía del liberalismo y la ruina de Occidente, „Derechos humanos” y desprecio del hombre, „No digas nunca la verdad”, Sobre la democracia en el mundo hispánico, Los derechos humanos, La moral de la derrota, Sentido del principio de subsidiariedad, La democracia atea, El ateísmo como soporte ideológico de la democracia, La metafísica del cambio, „Romanticismo y democracia” vistos por Vegas Latapié, La libertad de la Iglesia, La nuova situazione tra certezze e perplessità, En la democracia absoluta. El sentido de la libertad y la separación entre el Estado y la Iglesia, ¿Por qué descristianiza el liberalismo?''&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of his life Canals remained involved in cultural initiatives flavored with Traditionalism, often though not exclusively of the Carlist breed. The two which stand out are his contributions to ''Verbo'',&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Ayuso, ''Carlismo y tradición política hispánica'', [in:] ''Verbo'' 467-468 (2008), p. 581&lt;/ref&gt; a review issued since the 1950s, and activity in Junta de Gobierno of [[Centro de Estudios Zumalacárregui]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hoja Oficial del lunes'' 26.02.60, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=17&amp;path=7150513&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; A think-tank set up by offshoots from [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]], in the 1960s the Center staged Congresos de Estudios Tradicionalistas, attended by Canals;&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8420639478}}, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; he contributed also to its other initiatives, e.g. Jornadas Catalanes.&lt;ref&gt;''Un poco de historia: El Carlismo durante Franco'', [in:] ''Carlismo argentino'' service, available [http://carlismoar.blogspot.com/2006/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Working closely with pundits engaged in Carlist militancy,&lt;ref&gt;like [[Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola|Francisco Elías de Tejada]] or [[Rafael Gambra Ciudad|Rafael Gambra]]&lt;/ref&gt; Canals contributed to emphasizing the Traditionalist core of Carlism; they were very much aimed at confronting [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Progressist]] designs to re-formulate Carlist outlook. ''¿Qué es el carlismo?'', a 1971 booklet re-capturing the Carlist orthodoxy, listed Canals among supreme theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Elías de Tejada, Rafael Gambra Ciudad, Francisco Puy Muñoz, ''¿Que es el carlismo?'', Madrid 1971, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Canals did not explicitly identify himself as a Carlist, yet his writings implicitly suggest he embraced a Carlist identity. Though he admitted that historically Traditionalism and Carlism amalgamated as late as in the 1860s,&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Ayuso, ''El carlismo y su signo (a los 175 años)'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada'' 14 (2008) [furtherly referred as Ayuso 2008b], p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; he claimed also that since then&lt;ref&gt;unlike other Traditionalist scholars, e.g. Elías de Tejada, Canals considered Donoso Cortes, a vehemently anti-Carlist theorist, a genuine Traditionalist; Miguel Ayuso Torres, ''La Cotrarrevolución, entre la teoría y la historia'', [in:] Joaquim Veríssimo Serrão, Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza (eds.), ''La contrarrevolución legitimista, 1688-1876'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|9788489365155}} pp. 30-31; after the 1860s such a phenomenon was no longer possible&lt;/ref&gt; in real life the Traditionalist principles can be fully embodied only in Carlism, the sole genuine heir of Cristiandad and Las Españas&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, ''Nada sin Díos. Społeczne Królestwo Chrystusa jako sens i cel kontrrewolucji'', [in:] ''legitymizm.org service'', available [http://www.legitymizm.org/nada-sin-dios here]&lt;/ref&gt; and the guardian of Spanish moral and social order.&lt;ref&gt;it provided continuity between the past and the future, "vivir el hoy, para el mańana, en comunidad con el ayer de las Españas", Francisco Canals, ''Política española: pasado y futuro'', Madrid 1977, pp. 309-313. When discussing relations between Traditionalism and Carlism, one scholar differentiates between "visión histórica" of Francisco Elías de Tejada, "visión psicológica" of Rafael Gambra, and "visión genética" of Canals, Ayuso 2008b, pp. 127-136&lt;/ref&gt; Canals admitted a theoretical possibility of separate Traditionalist and Carlist identities, yet he considered such an option absurd, comparable to being an [[Orange Order|Orangist]] Roman Catholic Irishman&lt;ref&gt;see a related countryside footage [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2TXZrLmKGY here]&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, pp. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; To him, Traditionalism was the essence and Carlism was the existence; the former is the order of thought, "el orden del saber especulativo-práctico", while the latter is its practical embodiment.&lt;ref&gt;Ayuso 2008, pp. 130-135&lt;/ref&gt;

Canals is at times referred to as "Carlist thinker/philosopher",&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, pp. 16, 237, Ayuso 2008, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt; "Catalan Carlist"&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; or "outstanding/distinguished Carlist";&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 294, communique of Agencia FARO, 07.02.09, available [http://www.filosofia.org/bol/not/bn055.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; some count him among 4 contemporary "masters of Carlist thought"&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; or "most important intellectuals of two centuries of Carlism"&lt;ref&gt;Carmelo López-Arrias, ''Un americano en la corte carlista'', [in:] ''Intereconomia'' service, 31.08.11, availavle [https://intereconomia.com/noticia/un-americano-corte-carlista-20110831-20110831-0000/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; and claim that he "excelled as Carlist".&lt;ref&gt;''Francisco Canals Vidal'' entry, [in:] ''filosofia.org'' service&lt;/ref&gt; However, they note also that appreciative of legitimist thread, Canals has never been a partisan of any specific claimant and certainly stayed clear of [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Javierista]]-dominated Comunión Tradicionalista.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015, pp. 252, 320&lt;/ref&gt; More cautious scholars prefer to note him as involved in initiatives "linked to Carlist legitimism",&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 13.02.09, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2009/02/13/067.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; some settle for a general "Catholic conservative counter-revolutionary"&lt;ref&gt;"uno dei più brillanti e attivi intellettuali cattolici conservatori contro-rivoluzionari iberici del secolo scorso", Filippo Giorgiani, ''Francisco Canals Vidal, "Derechismo"'', [in:] ''The Candelabra of Italy'' service 21.07.12, available [https://thecandelabraofitaly.blogspot.com/2012/07/francisco-canals-vidal-derechismo-in.html?m=0 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and most opt for "Traditionalist intellectual".&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt; By opponents he was considered a "Catholic integrist" and "ultra-conservative",&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 31.12.14, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/2001/02/12/pagina-8/94811141/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being a bit of an understatement.&lt;ref&gt;López Arnal 2015&lt;/ref&gt; At times he is named a "Francoist" and "reactionary".&lt;ref&gt;both intended as abuse, López Arnal 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Some apply the term "ultraderechista" as an honor.&lt;ref&gt;Flavio Infante, ''Muy a la derecha de Francisco'', [in:] ''In exspectacione'' service 19.06.14, available [https://in-exspectatione.blogspot.com/2014/06/muy-la-derecha-de-francisco.html here]. Canals noted that his outlook was rooted in the period before the Right-Left paradigm was born, see his ''El „derechismo” y su inevitable deriva inquierdista'', [in:] ''Cristiandad'' 1953, re-published later in ''Política española: pasado y futuro''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gadi Taub''' ({{lang-he|גדי טאוב}}; born April 19, 1965 in [[Jerusalem]]) is an Israeli [[historian]], [[author]], [[screenwriter]], and political [[Op-ed|commentator]]. He is a [[Senior Lecturer]] in the School Public Policy and the Department of Communications at The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Taub is also an internationally noticed voice in the discourse on [[Zionism]].

==Life==
Taub's maternal grandparents were Zionist pioneers who came from Poland to Palestine, in the 1920s when the country was still under the British Mandate, to participate in the creation of a Jewish state. His father fled Czechoslovakia in 1939 after the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Nazi invasion]] but before the beginning of the [[Holocaust]]. He arrived in Palestine and was interned by the British along with his father. He later fought in the [[1948 Palestine war|1948 War of Independence]], where he was injured. After the war, having lost his ability to work with his hands, Taub's father studied economics and law, and later became deputy to the President of the [[Bank of Israel]].

Gadi Taub grew up in Jerusalem, and did his 3 years mandatory military service in the [[Israeli Air Force]]. From 1986 to 1998 he worked as a writer and presenter of children's programs on [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|Israeli radio and television]]. In the meantime he completed his bachelor's degree in History and General Humanities at [[Tel Aviv University]], wrote a bestselling book of short stories, and an influential book of essays, ''A Dispirited Rebellion: Essays on Contemporary Israeli Culture'', (Hebrew) which was highly critical of the postmodern trend in Israeli literature, popular culture, and academia. From 1998 to 2003 he was a Fellow at [[Rutgers University]], [[New Jersey]], where he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in American History for his thesis on American liberalism and philosophical pragmatism. Meanwhile, he continued to write prose, including the award-winning novel for young adults, [[The Witch from Melchet Street|The Witch From 3 Meltchet Street]] (Hebrew). Since 2003 he has taught at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he became a senior lecturer in 2010. In 2007 he published a book about religious settlers, which later saw an English version at [[Yale University Press]]. In this book Taub argues that the Settlement movement, far from being a continuation of Zionism, is actually a negation of it. In 2010 he published a short book entitled ''What Is Zionism'', available in Hebrew on the web. In 2009 he published a bestselling novel named ''Allenby Street'', which shed light on some less visible quarters of Israeli society – the backstreets, late night bars and strip clubs of [[Tel Aviv]]. Taub was both creator and co-screenwriter (along with Erez Kavel) of a TV series based on his novel. The series was broadcast on Israel's Channel 10 in 2012, and was a major hit. He was also head screenwriter and co-director of a forthcoming prime time series for Channel 2, entitled The Harem, which deals with a polygamous cult.

Since 1996 Gadi Taub has been a regular [[columnist]] for daily newspapers in Israel, first in [[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]] and later in [[Yedioth Ahronoth]], Israel's largest daily. He now writes opinion pieces for [[Haaretz]]. He has written political and cultural commentaries for the American and European press, including [[The New York Times]], [[The New Republic]], [[Die Zeit]], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[Corriere della Sera]], and others. He was a regular panelist on Channel 10's political show ''Council of the Wise''. He is a member of the academic council of ''The Metzila Center for Zionist, Jewish, Liberal and Humanist Thought''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metzilah.org.il/Metzilah_Center# Metzilah Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Taub sees himself as a Zionist in what he calls the original meaning of the term, that is, a believer in the right of all peoples, including the Jews, for self-determination in their own [[nation state]]. For that reason precisely he has always supported the creation of a Palestinian state beside Israel. Taub distinguishes between the original Zionism, which he calls ''Zionism of Liberty'' (or ''Zionism of State'') on the one hand, and a new [[Messianism|messianic]] kind of Zionism which emerged among a minority of Israelis after the [[Six-Day War|1967 war]], which he calls a ''Zionism of Land''. Zionism of Liberty of the kind professed by [[Theodor Herzl]] and [[David Ben Gurion]], sees Israel as an embodiment of the right of Jews to democratic self-determination, and is deeply democratic, while Zionism of Land is a "[[blood and soil]]" type of nationalism, for which the state of Israel is a means in fulfilling a mystical connection between the Jewish People and the Land of Israel. In Taub's view, Zionism of Land is not just an ideological negation of the original Zionism of Liberty, it is also the road to Israel's demise. The occupation of the [[West Bank]] not only violates the very right on which Zionism morally stands – the right of all peoples to self-determination as [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Israel's Declaration of Independence]] declares – it will also eventually lead to a [[One-state solution|bi-national state]] in which neither the Jews nor the Palestinians will be able to exercise self-determination. Therefore, Taub has been a vocal critic of the [[Settlement movement (Israel)|settlement movement]] and supports immediate unilateral withdrawal from all occupied territories, with or without a peace agreement. He is also a vocal critic of the extreme [[Post-Zionism|post-Zionist]] left, which does not acknowledge the right of Jews to national self-determination, and which advocates a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2253">'''George Crawford''' (also '''Crawfurd''') (1681-1748) was a Scottish genealogist and historian.

==Life==
He was the third son of Thomas Crawfurd of [[Cartsburn]].  When [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Simon Fraser]] laid claim to the [[Lord Lovat|barony of Lovat]], he employed Crawfurd to investigate the case and to supply materials to support it. It is said to have been chiefly due to the researches of Crawfurd that Fraser obtained a favorable decision; but he declined to pay Crawfurd anything.{{sfn|Henderson|1887}} 

He died at Glasgow, 24 December 1748.{{sfn|Henderson|1887}}

==Works==
Crawfurd was the author of:

*''Genealogical History of the Royal and Illustrious Family of the Stewarts from the year 1034 to the year 1710; to which are added the Acts of Sederunt and Articles of Regulation relating to them; to which is prefixed a General Description of the Shire of Renfrew'', Edinburgh, 1710;
*''The Peerage of Scotland, containing an Historical and Genealogical Account of the Nobility of that Kingdom'', Edinburgh, 1716; and 
*''Lives and Characters of the Crown Officers of Scotland, from the Reign of King David I to the Union of the two Kingdoms, with an Appendix of Original Papers'', vol. i. 1726. 

The ''Description of the Shire of Renfrew'' was published separately, with a continuation by Semple, at [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] in 1788, and a second edition, with a continuation by Robertson, also at Paisley, 1818. 

The "Letters of Simon, Lord Fraser, to George Crawfurd, 1728–30", while the Lovat case was in progress, were published in the ''Spottiswoode Miscellany'', 400–9.

==Family==
By his wife, Mary, daughter of [[James Anderson (lawyer)|James Anderson]], author of ‘Diplomata Scotiæ,’ he had four daughters.{{sfn|Henderson|1887}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5548">'''Henry Francis Pelham''', [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (10 September 1846 in [[Bergh Apton]], [[Norfolk]] &amp;ndash; 13 February 1907) was an English scholar and historian. He was [[Camden Professor of Ancient History]] at the [[University of Oxford]] from 1889 to 1907, and was also President of [[Trinity College, Oxford]] from 1897 to 1907.

==Life==
He was grandson of [[Thomas Pelham, 2nd Earl of Chichester]], and eldest of the five children of [[John Thomas Pelham]], bishop of Norwich, and Henrietta, second daughter of Thomas William Tatton of Wythenshawe Hall, Cheshire. 
Of his three brothers, John Barrington became vicar of Thundridge in 1908, and Sidney archdeacon of Norfolk in 1901. 
Pelham was born on 19 September 1846 at Bergh Apton, then his father's parish. 
Entering [[Harrow School|Harrow]] (Westcott's house) in May 1860, he moved rapidly up the school, and left in December 1864. 
Next year he won an open classical scholarship at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], matriculating on 22 April 1865; he came into residence in October. 
At Oxford he took 'first classes' in honour classical moderations and in ''[[literæ humaniores]]'', was elected a fellow of [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]] in 1869, and graduated B.A. in the same year. 
In 1870, he won the chancellor's English essay prize with a dissertation on the reciprocal influence of national character and national language. 
He worked continuously as classical tutor and lecturer at Exeter College from 1870 till 1889. He was elected by his college proctor of the university in 1879. 
Losing his fellowship on his marriage in 1873, he was re-elected in 1882, under the statutes of the second university commission.{{sfn|Haverfield|1912}}
 
From school onwards his principal subject was ancient and more particularly [[Roman history]]. He soon began to publish articles on this theme (first in ''Journal of Philology,'' 1876), while his lectures, which (under the system then growing up) were open to members of other colleges besides Exeter, attracted increasingly large audiences; he also planned, with the [[Clarendon Press]], a detailed ''History of the Roman Empire,'' which he was not destined to carry out. 
In 1887, he succeeded [[W. W. Capes]] as 'common fund reader' in ancient history, and in 1889 he became [[Camden Professor of Ancient History]] in succession to [[George Rawlinson]], a post to which a fellowship at [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]] is attached. 
As professor he developed the lectures and teaching which he had been giving as college tutor and reader, and attracted even larger audiences.{{sfn|Haverfield|1912}}

But his research work was stopped by an attack of [[cataract]] in both eyes (1890), and though a few specimen paragraphs of his projected ''History'' were set up in type in 1888, he completed in manuscript only three and a half chapters, covering the years B.C. 35-15, and he never resumed the work after 1890; his other research, too, was hereafter limited to detached points in Roman imperial history. 
On the other hand, he joined actively in administrative work, for which his strong personality and his clear sense fitted him at least as well as for research; he served on many Oxford boards, was a member of the hebdomadal council from 1879 to 1905, aided semi-academic edu- cational movements (for women, &amp;c.), and in 1897 accepted the presidency of his old college. Trinity. 
He was elected honorary fellow of Exeter in 1895, was an original fellow of the British Academy in 1902 and received the hon. degree of LL.D. at Aberdeen in 1906. 
He became [[F.S.A.]] in 1890.{{sfn|Haverfield|1912}}

He died in the president's lodgings at Trinity on 12 February 1907, and was buried in [[St Sepulchre's Cemetery]]. 
On 30 July 1873, he married Laura Priscilla, third daughter of [[Sir Edward Buxton, 2nd Baronet]], and granddaughter of [[Sir Fowell Buxton, 1st Baronet]]; she survived him with two sons and a daughter.{{sfn|Haverfield|1912}}

'''''Historiae Ecclesiasticae Tripartitae Epitome''''', the abridged history (in twelve books) of the early [[Christian Church]] known as the '''''Tripartite History,'''''  was the standard manual of Church history in [[Medieval Europe]]. 

The work was compiled, under the direction of [[Cassiodorus]], in about 510 CE, by his assistant [[Epiphanius Scholasticus]]. Epiphanius was assigned the translation into Latin of the Greek church histories of [[Socrates Scholasticus]], [[Sozomen]] and [[Theodoret]], written in the previous century. He would probably have used the library assembled by Cassiodorus at Monasterium Vivariense, the monastery of Vivarium on his family estates at the foot of Mount Moscius on the shores of the Ionian Sea. Cassiodorus revised and corrected the work and arranged it into one continuous history of the church. His [[scriptorium]] then published it for the use of the clergy. 

The book attained a high reputation. Only [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]' ''History'', in a Latin translation by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] competed with it as the official version of church history in the West, until original sources began to be rediscovered, edited and printed by [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars in the 15th century.

The '''Insurgency in Ogaden''' is an [[List of ongoing armed conflicts|ongoing]] separatist insurgency, waged by the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]] (ONLF) against the [[Ethiopia]]n government. The war began in 1994 when the ONLF attempted to recreate the [[Greater Somalia]]n state by unifying Ethiopia's [[Somali Region]] with [[Somalia]].

==Background==
[[File:Somali in Ethiopia.svg|thumb|Map of the Somali Region.]]

The Ogaden region was conquered by the [[Ethiopian Empire]] in the middle of the 19th century, making it a buffer zone between the state and expanding European interests in the region. Unlike the rest of Ethiopia it is populated by the Ogadeni people, a subgroup of Somalis. For most of its history under Ethiopian administration Ogaden was regarded as an inhospitable land, inhabited by uncivilized people who did not adhere to Christianity. Isolated military garrisons were erected through the land, exacting taxes from the local herders.&lt;ref name=CruX&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/files/africa/horn-of-africa/ethiopia-eritrea/207-ethiopia-prospects-for-peace-in-ogaden.pdf|title=Ethiopia: Prospects for Peace in Ogaden|work=Crisis Group|author=|date=6 August 2013|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Italy annexed Ethiopia in the aftermath of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], integrating Ogaden into [[Italian Somalia]] and thus creating an ethnically homogenous [[Greater Somalia]]. In 1941, Britain defeated [[Italian East Africa]], later installing a military administration of its own. The reunification of Ogaden with Somalia as well as the advocacy of British foreign minister [[Ernest Bevin]] for the creation of a Greater Somalian state forged what later came to be Somalian nationalism. Hopes of a unified Somalian state were not put into practice as Ogaden was gradually reincorporated into Ethiopia between 1948–1954. Somalia then began to sponsor the [[Western Somali Liberation Front]] and the [[Somali Abo Liberation Front]], armed separatist factions operating within Ethiopia. The 1969 and 1974 [[Coup d'état]]s in Somalia and Ethiopia respectively led to an unsuccessful Somalian [[Ogaden War|invasion]] of Ogaden. Ethiopia emerged victorious from the war, turning Ogaden into a militarized zone and conducting population transfers in order to quell any signs of sedition.&lt;ref name=CruX/&gt;

In the meantime the [[Eritrean People’s Liberation Front]] and the [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]] overthrew the Ethiopian [[Derg]] dictatorship, leading to a period of political instability. The [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] assumed power by creating a coalition of ethno-nationalist movements from across the country, choosing the previously marginalised [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]] as its ally in Ogaden. ONLF's previously exiled leadership returned from exile, gaining the support of local population. [[Eritrea]] attained independence in the aftermath of the [[Eritrean War of Independence]], inspiring ONLF to pursue a similar goal for Ogaden. In January 1993, ONLF candidate [[Abdillahi Mohammed Sadi]] was elected [[Somali Region]]al president by receiving 70% of the votes, Sadi was however sacked by Tigray People’s Liberation Front officials seven months later creating a power vacuum. Tensions between the TPLF and ONLF escalated in 1994, as ONLF split into a moderate wing willing to cooperate with TPLF and a radical secessionist wing led by [[Ibrahim Abdallah Mah]] that initiated armed struggle.&lt;ref name=CruX/&gt;

The outbreak of the conflict soon attracted the attention of jihadist elements in the region. The Somali militant group [[Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya]], established a training camp in [[Luuq]], while portraying the war as a clash of Christianity and Islam. Its Ogaden wing later conducted a series of attacks on major Ethiopian cities. [[Osama bin Laden]] described Ogaden as place where Muslims were oppressed by a “Judeo-Christian alliance” during his 1996 declaration of jihad against the [[United States]]. [[Al-Qaeda]] agents had previously infiltrated Ogaden, investing $3 million in smuggling foreign fighters into the region. Fighters from Turkey, Bosnia, Egypt, France, Gambia and other countries joined the conflict taking part in 35 engagements between June – July 1996. However, Islamist involvement in the war fell into obscurity after three successful government operations against [[Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya]], that took place on 9 August 1996, 20 December 1996 and January 1997. Bin Laden's relocation from Sudan to Afghanistan also shifted Al-Qaeda's focus from the region.&lt;ref name=JiHx&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jihadology.net/2015/01/12/the-clear-banner-turkish-foreign-fighters-and-the-ogaden/|title=The Clear Banner: Turkish Foreign Fighters and the Ogaden|work=Jihadology|author=Aaron|date=12 January 2015|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2003, ONLF initiated the Operation Mandad, aiming the expulsion of government troops from the districts of Korahey and Dolo. Two days later a battle took place in the towns of Alen and Garas Qalo, security forces suffered 60 fatalities and lost 2 army trucks, 41 rebels were also killed in the fighting. Authorities responded by imposing curfews on the towns of Kebri Dehar, Warder, and Shilabo, 36 suspected militants were also arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article9227|title=Ethiopian rebels claim victory over government forces in southeast|work=Sudan Tribune|date=23 April 2003|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 2005, insurgents launched attacks against government troops stationed in the towns of [[Hamarro]] and [[Fiq Zone|Fik]], killing 4 and injuring 5 soldiers.&lt;ref name=VaC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article12271|title=Ethiopia’s Oganden rebels claim attacks against regular troops|work=Sudan Tribune|date=25 October 2005|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2005, Ethiopian troops allegedly committed a massacre of 30 civilians and prisoners after the later demanded better treatment from their captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article12607|title=Ogaden’s ONLF calls to condemn Ethiopia for massacre of 31 civilians|work=Sudan Tribune|date=15 November 2005|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2006, an ONLF delegation conducted a briefing with officials representing the Danish foreign ministry, human rights abuses were discussed during the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article14583|title=Ethiopian rebels delegation meets Danish officials|work=Sudan Tribune|date=16 March 2006|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2006, a communique issued by ONLF announced the shootdown of an Ethiopian airforce, transport helicopter. The incident reportedly took place in the vicinity of the town [[Gabo Gabo]], Qorahay zone, 20 soldiers were killed in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article16776|title=ONLF shoots down Ethiopian military helicopter|work=Sudan Tribune|date=23 July 2006|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Abole oil field raid}}
On 24 April 2007, ONLF launched an attack on a Chinese owned oil facility in [[Abole]], a total of 74 people were killed in the attack including 9 Chinese citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/xw/t314025.htm|title= China strongly condemns attack on Chinese oil company site in Ethiopia|publisher=Embassy of People's Republic of China in the United States of America|date=2007-04-25|accessdate=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|2007–08 Ethiopian crackdown in Ogaden}}
In response to the April 2007 ONLF attack, Ethiopian security forces initiated a large scale counter insurgency campaign against the ONLF. Between June 2007 – May 2008 approximately 1,000 people were killed as the opposing faction engaged in combat and committed human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Barry|last=Malone|title=UN to open office in Ethiopia's troubled Ogaden|url=http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL06251906.html|work=Africa.reuters.com|publisher=Reuters|date=2007-11-06|accessdate=2007-11-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071123123916/http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL06251906.html| archivedate= 23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2007, an ONLF ambush outside the town of [[Shilaabo]] resulted in the deaths of 43 soldiers, the separatists suffered 5 casualties and 8 rebels were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article22690|title=Ogaden rebels say 43 Ethiopian soldiers killed in ambush attack|work=Sudan Tribune|date=15 November 2005|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2008, a government official announced the death of former top guerrilla commander [[Mohamed Sirad Dolal]], following an operation in the Denan woreda of the Gode zone. By the time of his death Sirad had left ONLF and operated as a commander of [[Al-Itihad Al-Islami]].&lt;ref name=Sir&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article29940|title=Ethiopia claims killing of rebel leader in Ogaden|work=Sudan Tribune|date=22 January 2008|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 2009, an Ethiopian court convicted Bashir Ahmed Makhtal, an Ethiopian born Canadian citizen to life in prison, on charges of belonging to ONLF. Makhtal denied all allegations, stating that the reason behind his prosecution is his relation to one of ONLF's founding members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article32025|title=Ethiopia sentences Canadian to life on terrorism charges|work=Sudan Tribune|date=9 August 2009|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2009, an ONLF spokesman accused the governments of [[Puntland]] and [[Somaliland]] of handing over ONLF rebels to the Ethiopean security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article32929|title=Ogaden rebels accuse Puntland of handing over youth to Ethiopia|work=Sudan Tribune|date=27 October 2009|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2011, Ethiopian authorities freed 402 previously imprisoned ONLF members as part of a peace deal, previously signed with one of ONLF's factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article37629|title=Ethiopia releases hundreds of jailed ONLF rebels|work=Sudan Tribune|date=11 January 2011|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 July 2011, government troops killed 15 and detained 6 rebels, 2 Swedish journalists accompanying the militants were also wounded during the engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article39426|title=Ethiopia: Army kills 15 rebels, wounds Swedish journalists|work=Sudan Tribune|date=4 July 2011|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 2011, a band of ONLF rebels attacked a military convoy escorting Chinese oil workers, outside the city of Jijiga. The insurgents claimed to have killed 25 soldiers while suffering several casualties, a government spokesman denied the ambush took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14763076|title=Ethiopia denies troops killed by Ogaden rebels|work=BBC|author=|date=2 September 2011|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 16–17 March 2012, according to a [[Human Rights Watch]] report, Ethiopian special police forces executed 10 civilians and looted dozens of shops in the village of Raqda, the attack came as a retaliation for the recent death of several policemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article42741|title=HRW: Ethiopian special forces execute 10 civilians|work=Sudan Tribune|date=22 May 2012|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 10 – 24 October 2013, ONLF carried out attacks on 13 military outposts in the Korehey and Nogob zones, the faction claimed to have killed 24 soldiers during the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somalilandsun.com/index.php/regional/4099-onlf-attacks-several-military-posts-in-ogaden|title=ONLF attacks several military posts in Ogaden|work=Somaliland Sun|author=Mohamed Faarah|date=26 October 2013|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2013, government troops engaged insurgents in the Banbaas, Qolaji and Hora-hawd villages, a rebel spokesman declared that 45 soldiers were killed in the battle, as rebels captured caches of weaponry and other equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ogaden.com/hornnews/ogaden/1681-heavy-fighting-continues-in-ogaden-for-the-2nd-straight-day-.html|title=Heavy fighting continues in Ogaden for the 2nd straight day|work=Ogaden Online|author=|date=7 December 2013|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1 June – 9 July 2014, five Ethiopian nationals were gunned down in the city of [[Garissa]], Kenya. Investigations into the murders revealed the victims to be ONLF members or sympathizers, three Ethiopians and two Kenyans were detained in connection with the murders. The perpetrators allegedly belong to Ethiopian government militias. An ONLF official accused the militias of killing at least 10 Ogadenian refugees between 2010–2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mavulture.com/news/trouble-in-the-north-as-renewed-clan-fighting-re-ignites-mandera-proxy-wars-wrack-garissa-county/|title=Trouble in the North: As renewed clan fighting re-ignites Mandera, proxy wars wrack Garissa county|work=MA Vulture|author=|date=27 August 2014|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2015, a Liyuu police unit skirmished with ONLF rebels in the Las-Galol village south-east of the city of [[Harar]]. A day earlier clashes took place in Galalshe, [[Jigjiga]] area. The incident took place amidst an escalation in fighting following the death of ONLF commander Mustafe Haybe, two journalists and allegedly 120 government soldiers in recent engagements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ayyaantuu.com/horn-of-africa-news/ogaden/onlf-fighters-and-ethiopian-security-forces-engage-in-skirmish-in-ogaden-region/|title=ONLF Fighters and Ethiopian Security Forces engage in Skirmish in Ogaden Region|work=Ayyaantuu|author=Ahmed Abdi|date=26 February 2015|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human Rights Situation==
A number of non-government organisations have accused the Ethiopian military and police of committing human rights violations. A [[Human Rights Watch]] representative compared the actions of Ethiopian security forces to crimes against humanity. Ethiopian soldiers and policemen have reportedly participated in numerous instances of rape, arbitrary detention, selective killings, torture and vandalism. In 2005, Ethiopian troops allegedly destroyed a village populated by the Armak minority, killing the denizens with metal bars. [[New York Times]] journalists reporting on the story were detained without charges and had their equipment confiscated. Ethiopia's tight control on the access of independent journalists into the region, has complicated the examination of assertions made by both sides of the conflict. ONLF activists have also claimed that Ethiopian officials used foreign aid as a form of blackmail, purposefully starving thousands of people. The above accusations have been dismissed by the Ethiopian government, which accused NGOs of acting as propaganda tools while completely ignoring abuses committed by the guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2012/09/201291611594965136.html|title=New fighting force in Ethiopia's Ogaden|work=Al Jazeera|author=|date=16 September 2012|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/24/ethiopia.somalia|title=The Ogaden: a forgotten war draining a forgotten people|work=Guardian|author=|date=24 March 2008|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/18/world/africa/18ethiopia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=In Ethiopia, Fear and Cries of Army Brutality |work=New York Times|author=Jeffrey Gettleman|date=18 June 2007|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Burks''' (born October 4, 1964), better known by his stage name '''Jaz-O''', is an American [[rapper]] and [[record producer]] active in the late 1980s through the 1990s, best known for being the mentor of Brooklyn rapper [[Jay-Z]]. Jaz is also known as the Originator and had a song called "The Originators" that featured a young Jay-Z in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/jay-z/biography|title=Jay-Z Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As The Jaz, he had success with his 1989 single "Hawaiian Sophie" from his debut album ''Word to the Jaz''. He has been featured on some of Jay-Z's songs, such as "Bring it On" (from ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]''), "[[Ain't No Nigga]]", and the single "[[Nigga What, Nigga Who]] (Originator 99)" from ''[[Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life]]'', where he was credited as '''Big Jaz'''. He also produced the single "Ain't No Nigga" from ''Reasonable Doubt'' and the song "Rap Game/Crack Game" from ''[[In My Lifetime, Vol. 1]]''. The album "Kingz Kounty (2002) - with The Immobilarie Present" marked the last time Jay-Z and mentor Jaz-O would ever collaborate.

==Career==
===Feud with Jay-Z===
The long-standing feud between him and Jay-Z started when Jay-Z started [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] and he tried to convince Jaz-O and fellow rapper [[Sauce Money]] to sign with the label. They both refused. It is rumored that they didn't trust Roc-A-Fella Records CEO's [[Damon Dash]] and Kareem "Biggs" Burke.  In addition, they weren't satisfied with what they were to be receiving had they signed the contract, $300,000 in Jaz-O's case. Jay-Z confirms this event on the song "What We Talkin' About" on the ''[[Blueprint 3]]'' album when he says "Dame made millions, even Jaz made some scraps, he could've made more but he ain't sign his contract".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/07/20-rappers-who-almost-signed-to-other-labels/jaz-o|title=20 Rappers Who Almost Signed To Other LabelsJaz-O|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaz was an important figure in the [[Nas#2001–2003: Dispute with Jay-Z and artistic comeback|Nas vs. Jay-Z feud]]. It is also speculated that Jaz-O supplied [[Nas]] with some of the information he used in his Jay-Z [[diss track]] "[[Ether (song)|Ether]]". After the situation with Nas cooled down, Jay-Z went on to diss Jaz first on a track released by [[DJ Kayslay]] featuring [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]], Geda K, [[Young Gunz|Young Chris]], and [[Memphis Bleek]] titled "Fuck Jaz-O AKA Jaz Ho" in which they rapped over [[Styles P]]'s "[[Good Times (Styles P song)|Good Times]]" instrumental and later on his album ''[[The Blueprint 2: The Gift &amp; The Curse]]''. Jay-Z states on the track, "I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O." Jaz responded with a record on a DJ Kayslay mixtape entitled "Ova" and after the response from Jay-Z and the members of Roc-A-Fella, he released his own response with the diss record known as "Ova Part 2" in which he raps over [[N.O.R.E.]]'s "[[Nothin' (song)|Nothin']]" instrumental.

Despite the long-standing feud between mentor and protégé, Jay-Z still gives Jaz-O credit for his success (although he disses him at the same time) as heard in the song "I Do It For Hip Hop" on [[Ludacris]]'s ''[[Theater of the Mind]]'' album. Jay-Z says "Shout out to [[Grand Master Flash]] and to [[Grandmaster Caz|Caz]] and even Jaz's bum ass".

Soon after the "I Do It For Hip Hop" diss from Jay-Z, Jaz-O responded with a diss record entitled "Go Harder" where he starts by rapping over his protege's "Brooklyn Go Hard" beat before the beat changes.

In late August 2009, Jaz-O was featured on another song dissing Jay-Z entitled "Gangstas Ride" with West Coast rapper, [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]]. Jaz references "Ether" with the line, "Jaz-O, stupid motherfucker, not Shawn, never been bashed on a [[Tupac]] song". The song was fueled by the beef between Game and Jay-Z.

In December 2017 they reunited at Jay Z's [[4:44 (album)|''4:44'']] concert seemingly ending the feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/12/jay-z-jaz-o-reunite-444-tour-chicago/|title=Jay-Z and Jaz-O Reunite at 4:44 Tour Stop in Chicago - XXL|last=|first=|date=|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL Mag]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
Besides being an emcee, he has produced songs for several hip hop artists other than Jay-Z, such as [[Group Home]], [[M.O.P]], [[Ras Kass]], [[Rakim]], [[Kool G Rap]], and others.

[[File:Juan Galindo.jpg|thumb|Juan Galindo]]
'''Juan Galindo''' (1802–January 30, 1840) was an Anglo-Irish political activist and military and administrative officer under the Liberal government of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. He represented the government in a diplomatic mission to the United States and England. His duties in Central America allowed him to explore the region and examine Maya ruins. The reports on his findings earned him recognition as early pioneer of Maya archaeology. 

==Early Years==
Galindo was born in [[Dublin]] in 1802 as John Galindo.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Philemon Galindo]] was an Englishman of Spanish descent and his mother, Catherine Gough, was Irish.&lt;ref name="Drew99p51"&gt;Drew 1999, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents were actors who met while working at a theater in [[Bath, Somerset |Bath]]. They married in Dublin in 1801. His early life is obscure and it is not known why or exactly when he left for the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse, 1973. p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Sources differ on his emigration but sometime before he was twenty he either joined Admiral [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]] to fight for Chile's independence or he joined his uncle, a plantation owner in Jamaica. 

The first clear record of his early career occurred in 1827 when he worked as secretary and translator for the British consul in Guatemala. By 1828 he was the superintendent for improvements at the port of [[Iztapa]] as well as a major in a Honduras battalion.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse, 1973. p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal Republic of Central America==
In 1829 the Liberal forces led by [[Francisco Morazán]] invaded Guatemala. Galindo joined the Liberals and Morazán's army quickly brought the revolution to a successful end. Morazán established the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] and Galindo enjoyed the patronage of Morazán and [[Mariano Gálvez]], the chief of state in Guatemala. The new federal congress granted Galindo naturalization papers and he changed his name to Juan.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, 1960. p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

Galindo undertook several military assignments for the new government, including officer of a military garrison at Omoa, commander of the port at Trujillo, and military governor of [[Petén Department|Petén]]. In 1834, he received a million-acre land grant in Petén with the stipulations that he pacify the native  [[Lacandon people|Lacandon Maya]] and settle the area in five years with colonists who would be loyal to the Guatemalan government.&lt;ref name="Drew99p51"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, 1960. p.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; He soon realized that the boundary between Guatemala and [[History of Belize (1506–1862)|Belize]] was in dispute and the British claimed that Galindo's new land grant belonged to Belize. British [[mahogany]] cutters were actively logging the area, depriving Galindo of the land's most valuable asset. When discussions with [[Frederick Chatfield]] in Belize failed to resolve the issue, Central America appointed Galindo as envoy to negotiate directly with the British Foreign Office in London.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, 1960. p.28-33&lt;/ref&gt;

Galindo left Central America in January, 1835, stopping first in Washington, DC in hopes of enlisting the United States to support his cause against Britain. In return, Galindo offered to provide information regarding possible canal routes through Nicaragua. He met with Secretary of State [[John Forsyth (Georgia)|John Forsyth]] and President [[Andrew Jackson]] in May, 1835 but failed to gain their support. Galindo proceeded to London and arrived there in August. He had a meeting with Foreign Secretary [[Lord Palmerston]] soon after his arrival but then talks proceeded in a desultory fashion. By April 1836 Palmerston had determined not to work with Galindo and offered the expedient excuse that since Galindo was born a British subject, he could not represent a foreign government.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, 1960. p.33-40&lt;/ref&gt; 

Without a clear title to his land grant in Petén, Galindo was unable to attract settlers. Instead, he petitioned Central America for another opportunity and was provided a grant on the [[Mosquito Coast]]. While still in London, Galindo recruited his father and other relatives to lead a group of colonists to settle on this remote coast. This enterprise ended in failure; the settlers were ill-equipped, lacked sufficient supplies, and found no way to earn a living once they arrived. By the time Galindo returned to Central America in 1836, the settlement had collapsed and his father had returned to England. He also found that his influence with the Central America government was greatly diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, 1960. p.42-45&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal regime that had governed Central America was under pressure on several fronts. Galindo attempted to rally support against perceived British aggression but this effort failed to gain popular attention. When civil war broke out, he rejoined the army under Liberal general, [[Trinidad Cabañas]]. Cabañas was defeated by the joint forces of Honduras and Nicaragua near the city of [[Tegucigalpa]] and Galindo was killed on January 30, 1840 in the aftermath of the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse, 1973. p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maya archaeology==
As military governor of Petén, Galindo undertook an exploratory trip down the [[Usumacinta River]] and then crossed overland to reach the Maya ruins at [[Palenque]] in April 1831. He spent a month exploring the site and wrote an account of the various structures, drew plans, and sketched several of the decorations he encountered. Later that year his account was published by the London ''Literary Gazette'' and the Geographical Society in Paris. He also sent a small collection of Maya objects to the Royal Society in London.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse, 1973. p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, Galindo was sent by the Central American government to survey and report on the ruins at [[Copán]]. He spent about ten weeks exploring the area, writing reports and sketching his findings. He wrote two brief reports for the London ''Literary Gazette'' and the [[American Antiquarian Society]]. A more detailed report with twenty-six illustrations was sent to the [[Société de Géographie]] in Paris and the original was sent to his government with the mistaken assumption that it would be published. Instead, it was filed away and "lost" for more than a hundred years when it was uncovered and published in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse, 1973. p.44&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although it was just a small part of his career, Galindo proved to be an astute observer and an effective communicator who earned recognition as an early pioneer of Maya archaeology. He wrote some thirty-two letters to the Société de Géographie sharing his ideas and insights. Galindo was one of the first to point out the close resemblance between the contemporary [[Maya peoples]] and the carved images of the ancient Maya to be found among the ruins. He correctly suggested that the original Maya civilization was created by the ancestors of the contemporary Mayas.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, pp.51–53.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first investigator to carefully copy the Maya hieroglyphics and identify them as a unique form of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse, 1973. p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis draws on some [[Middle Ages|medieval]] sources such as the [[Khazar Correspondence]], according to which at some point in the 8th–9th centuries, the ruling elite of the Khazars was said by [[Judah Halevi]] and [[Abraham ibn Daud]] to have converted to [[Rabbinic Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of the [[Conversion to Judaism|conversion]] within the [[Khazar Khanate]] remains uncertain: the evidence used to tie the Ashkenazi communities to the Khazars is meager and subject to conflicting interpretations.&lt;ref name="Aderet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WayneState2013" /&gt;

This hypothesis has had a complex history within academia. While most contemporary scholars dismiss it, the hypothesis has often been argued in the past, and still finds occasional defenders of its plausibility. In the late 19th century, [[Ernest Renan]] and other scholars speculated that the Ashkenazi Jews of Europe [[ethnogenesis|originated]] among Turkic refugees who had migrated from the collapsed Khazarian Khanate westward into Europe, and [[language shift|exchanged]] their native [[Khazar language]] for [[Yiddish]] while continuing to practice [[Judaism]]. Though intermittently evoked by several scholars since that time, the Khazar-Ashkenazi hypothesis came to the attention of a much wider public with the publication of [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[The Thirteenth Tribe]]'' in 1976.&lt;ref name="Sand 2010 240"&gt;{{harvnb|Sand|2010|p=240.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been revived recently by [[Eran Elhaik]], who in 2012 conducted a study aiming to vindicate it.&lt;ref name="rubin" /&gt;  Despite skepticism, he reformulated the concept in 2016 by developing a novel method of genetic analysis that uses the fringe [[linguistic]] theories of the Yiddish expert [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]].&lt;ref&gt;Batya Ungar-Sargon [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/176580/yiddishland 'The Mystery of the Origins of Yiddish Will Never Be Solved,'] [[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]] 23 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic studies on Jews]] have found no substantive evidence of a Khazar origin among Ashkenazi Jews, as opposed to evidence they have mixed [[Near East]]ern/Mediterranean and Southern European origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3032072 | pmid=20560205 | volume=86 | title=Abraham's children in the genome era: major Jewish diaspora populations comprise distinct genetic clusters with shared Middle Eastern Ancestry | date=June 2010 | journal=Am.

The hypothesis has been used at times by [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionists]] to challenge the idea that Jews have ancestral ties to ancient Israel, and it has also played a role in [[anti-Semitic]] attitudes.

==History==

===1806–1918===
Some sources attribute to the Ukrainian Rabbi [[Isaac Baer Levinsohn]] (1788–1860) the first reference to a connection between the Ashkenazi Jews and the Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence J. Epstein]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=veJdBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 ''Converts to Judaism: Stories from Biblical Times to Today,''] Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015 p.72&lt;/ref&gt; Levinsohn also recorded that the tradition of their forefathers was that Ashkenazi Jews had earlier spoken Russian before acquiring [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Spolsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Xk9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 ''The Languages of the Jews;A Sociolinguistic History,''] Cambridge University Press 2014 p.297 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.it"&gt;[[Shlomo Sand]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=pgsP0DFkmp0C&amp;pg=PA243 ''The Invention of the Jewish People,''] Verso p.243.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was advanced in 1808 by [[Gustav von Ewers|Johann Ewers]],&lt;ref&gt;''Vom Ursprung des Russischen Staats, ''. 1808&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of an early controversy over the foundations of the Russian state, which pitted scholars espousing a Norman origin for the [[Varangians]] against those who argued that these founders of the [[Kievan Rus']] were Slavic and indigenous. Ewers proposed the idea that the Viking/Varangian founders were in fact Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Vucinich, [https://books.google.com/books?id=czysAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA213 ''Science in Russian Culture: A History to 1860,'']'' Stanford University Press, vol.1 1963 p.213.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birgit Scholz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QPUrwrAABvEC&amp;pg=PA14 ''Von der Chronistik zur modernen Geschichtswissenschaft: die Warägerfrage in der russischen, deutschen und schwedischen Historiographie,''] Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2000 pp.13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vilhelm Thomsen|Vilhelm Ludvig Peter Thomsen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6CMcqGmzuYC&amp;pg=PA16 ''The Relations Between Ancient Russia and Scandinavia, and the Origin of the Russian State: Three Lectures Delivered at the Taylor Institution. Oxford, in May, 1876,''] Cambridge University Press, reprint 2010 p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian historian  [[Nikolay Karamzin]] advanced the claim, asserting that considerable numbers of Khazars had left Khazaria for Kievan Rus' in the time of [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir I]] (980–1015).&lt;ref name="Straten"&gt;Jits van Straten, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Sy4ZuWw8TgC&amp;pg=PA2 ''The Origin of  Ashkenazi Jewry:The Controversy Unravelled,''] Walter de Gruyter 2011 pp.2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The German Orientalist [[Karl Friedrich Neumann|Karl Neumann]] suggested as early as 1847 that the migration of Khazars might have contributed to the formation of the core population of the Jews of Eastern Europe, without however specifying whether he was referring to Judaizing Turks or ethnic Jewish residents of Khazaria.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Kizilov, [https://books.google.com/books?id=36t_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA388 'National Inventions:The Imperial Emancipation of the Karaites from Jewishness,'] in Roland Cvetkovski, Alexis Hofmeister (eds.),''An Empire of Others: Creating Ethnographic Knowledge in Imperial Russia and the USSR,'' Central European University Press, 2014 pp.369-393 p.399, citing [[Karl Friedrich Neumann|Karl Neumann]], [https://archive.org/details/dievlkerdessdli00neumgoog ''Die Völker des südlichen Russlands in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung,''] (1847) 2nd ed. Teubner 1855 pp.125-6:'Die Chasaren verschwinden nun als gebietende Horde aus der Geschichte, aber ihr Name hat sich, wie bekannt, in den Ländern und an den Meeren, wo sie ehemals herrschten, noch Jahrhunderte lang und zum Theil bis auf den heutigen Tag erhalten. Auch ist ja die Masse des Volkes von dem Jaik bis zur Donau immerdar dieselbe geblieben; es haben die Chasaren nur die Herrschaft verloren, welche auf andere Türken überging, auf Petschenegen, Usen und Komanen. Reste dieses Volkes, namentlich der zum Mosaismus sich bekennenden Abtheilung, sind die Karaim im südlichen Russland und den ehemaligen polnischen Ländern, welche türkisch sprechen  undauch in Körpergestalt und Gesichtszügen den Türken gleichen. Von der Krim aus mögen auch zuerst die Juden, welche, wie wir wissen, so zahlreich waren im Reiche der Chasaren, nach Russland und Polen gewandert sein.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, [[Abraham Harkavy|Abraham Eliyahu Harkavi]] suggested in 1869 that there might be a link between the Khazars and European Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossman|2002|p=98}}: Abraham Harkavy, ''O iazike evreev, zhivshikh v drevnee vremia na Rusi i o slavianskikh slovakh, vstrechaiuschikhsia u evreiskikh pisatelei,'' St. Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, however, in 1872, a [[Crimean Karaite]], [[Abraham Firkovich]], alternatively proclaimed that the members of his Turkic-speaking sect were descended from Turkic converts to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nathans|1999|p=409}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis, that the descendents of Khazar converts to Judaism formed a major proportion of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]], was first proposed to a Western public by [[Ernest Renan]] in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barkun|1997|p=137}}: Ernest Renan, "Judaism as a Race and as Religion." Delivered on the January 27, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossman|2002|p=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a lecture delivered in Paris before the [[Saint-Simon Foundation|''Cercle du Saint-Simon'']] on 27 January 1883, Renan argued that conversion played a significant role in the formation of the Jewish people, stating that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This conversion of the kingdom of the Khazars has a considerable importance regarding the origin of those Jews who dwell in the countries along the Danube and southern Russia. These regions enclose great masses of Jewish populations which have in all probability nothing or almost nothing that is anthropologically Jewish in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renan|1883}}:Cette conversion du royaume des Khozars a une importance considérable dans la question de l’origine des juifs qui habitent les pays danubiens et le midi de la Russie. Ces régions renferment de grandes masses de populations juives qui n’ont probablement rien ou presque rien d’ethnographiquement juif.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renan's thesis found an echo soon after, in 1885, when [[Isidore Loeb]], a rabbi, historian and secretary of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]], in arguing for the cause of [[Jewish emancipation]], challenged the notion that nations were based on races, and the Jews therefore could be excluded as alien. To the contrary, he argued, they were no different from other  peoples and nations, all of which arose from miscegenation: the Jews were no exception, and one could assume, he added, that many German and Russian Jews descended from the Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore Loeb]] ‘Reflections on the Jews,’  in Mitchell Bryan Hart (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=556jcvWbwrcC&amp;pg=PA17 ''Jews and Race: Writings on Identity and Difference, 1880-1940,''] UPNE, 2011 pp.12-20  p.17. Cf. Isidore Loeb, ''Réflexions sur les Juifs,' [[Revue des Études Juives]], 27 (1893) pp.1-31). This was published posthumously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasional suggestions emerged that there was a small Khazar component in East European Jews in works by [[Joseph Jacobs]] (1886), [[Henri Jean Baptiste Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu|Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu]] (1893),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singerman|2004|pp=3–4}}, ''Israël chez les nations'' (1893):Eng.''Israel Among the Nations'' (1895).&lt;/ref&gt; Maksymilian Ernest Gumplowicz,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Polonsky|Basista|Link-Lenczowski|1993|p=120}}. In the book ''Początki religii żydowskiej w Polsce,'' Warsaw: E. Wende i S-ka, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Russian-Jewish anthropologist Samuel Weissenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|2006|p=131}}. Goldstein writes: ‘The theory that Eastern European Jews descended from the Khazars was originally proposed by . .Samuel Weissenberg in an attempt to show that Jews were deeply rooted on Russian soil and that the cradle of Jewish civilization was the Caucasus’. Weissenberg’s book ''Die Südrussischen Juden'', was published in 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leroy-Beaulieu, a critic of anti-Semitism who perhaps drew on Renan, queried whether or not thousands of [[Polish Jews|Polish]] and [[Russian Jews]] might have their origins traced back to the "old nomads of the steppes."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singerman|1998|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 Hugo von Kutschera developed the notion into a book-length study,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koestler|1976|pp=134,150}}. ''Die Chasaren; historische Studie,'' A. Holzhauen, Vienna 1909. 2nd ed., 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Khazars formed the foundational core of the modern Ashkenazi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koestler|1976|pp=134,150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Fishberg]] introduced the notion to an [[United States|American]] audience in 1911 in his book, ''The Jews: A Study of Race and Environment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|2006|p=131}}. Maurice Fishberg, ''The Jews: A Study of Race and Environment.''&lt;/ref&gt;

When at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], a Jewish [[Zionist]] called [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] the land of the Jewish people's ancestors, [[Joseph Reinach]], a [[French Jews|French Jewish]] [[member of parliament]] who was opposed to Zionism, dismissed the idea, arguing that Jews descended from Israelites were a tiny minority. In his view, conversion had played a major role in the expansion of the Jewish people, and, in addition, he claimed, the majority of "Russian, Polish and [[Galician Jews]] descend from the Khazars, a Tatar people from the south of Russia who converted to Judaism in mass at the time of [[Charlemagne]]."&lt;ref&gt;John Quigley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GX8jX9dJXIAC&amp;pg=PA71 ''Palestine and Israel: A Challenge to Justice,''] Duke University Press, 1990 p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interwar years, 1918–1939===
The idea was also taken up by the Polish-Jewish economic historian and [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] Yitzhak Schipper in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Litman|1984|pp=85–110,109}}. Schipper’s first monograph on this was published in the ''Almanach Žydowski'' (Vienna) in 1918, While in the [[Warsaw ghetto]] before falling victim to the Holocaust at [[Majdanek]], Schipper (1884-1943) was working on the Khazar hypothesis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brook|2009|p=210}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by scholarly anthropologists, such as [[Roland Burrage Dixon|Roland B. Dixon]] (1923), and by writers like [[H. G. Wells]] (1921) who used it to argue that "The main part of Jewry never was in Judea",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|2004|p=2}}:"There were Arab tribes who were Jews in the time of Muhammad, and a Turkic people who were mainly Jews in South Russia in the ninth century. Judaism is indeed the reconstructed political ideal of many shattered peoples-mainly semitic. As a result of these coalescences and assimilations, almost everywhere in the towns throughout the Roman Empire, and far beyond it in the east, Jewish communities traded and flourished, and were kept in touch through the Bible, and through a religious and educational organization. The main part of Jewry never was in Judea and had never come out of Judea."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singerman|2004|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a thesis that was to have a political echo in later opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2003|p=22}}: [[John Bagot Glubb|Pasha Glubb]] held that Russian Jews ‘have considerably less Middle Eastern blood, consisting largely of pagan Slav proselytes or of Khazar Turks.’ For Glubb, they were not 'descendants of the Judeans . .The Arabs of Palestine are probably more closely related to the Judeans (genetically) than are modern Russian or German Jews'. . 'Of course, an anti-Zionist (as well as an anti-Semitic) point is being made here: The Palestinians have a greater political right to Palestine than the Jews do, as they, not the modern-day Jews, are the true descendants of the land's Jewish inhabitants/owners'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roland Burrage Dixon ''The Racial History of Man,'' 1923; [[H. G. Wells]], [[The Outline of History]] (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote to [[Max Eitingon]] that the sculptor [[Oscar Nemon]], for whom he was sitting, showed the lineaments of a "Slavic Eastern Jew, Khazar or [[Kalmuck]] or something like that".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilman|1995|p=30|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, [[Samuel Krauss]] ventured the theory that the biblical [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenaz]] referred to northern [[Asia Minor]], and he identified it with the Khazars, a position immediately disputed by Jacob Mann.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malkiel|2008|p=263,n.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interwar period consolidated also a belief, originally developed by the Russian Orientalists V.V. Grigor’iev and V.D. Smirnov, that the East European congregations of the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite sect]] of Judaism were descendants of Turkic Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Kizilov, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i6SlCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA450 ''The Sons of Scripture: The Karaites in Poland and Lithuania in the Twentieth Century,''] Walter de Gruyter 2015 pp.109ff., p.450.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a Khazarian origin of the Karaites was then adopted as their official viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Dov Walfish  (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7M0_Ba0lDjwC&amp;pg=PA146 ''Библиография Караитика: Аннотированная Библиография Караимов И Караимизма,''] BRILL, 2011 p.146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seraya Shapshal|Seraja Szapszal]] (1873–1961), from 1927, the [[Hakham|ḥakham]] of the Polish-Lithuanian Karaite community had begun to implement a thorough-going reform policy of dejudaizing Karaite culture and traditions and transforming along Turkic lines. As a secular Jew and orientalist he was influenced by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk's reforms]], and his policy was dictated by several considerations: Jews were suffering from harassment in public and private in Eastern Europe; he wished to forestall the threat he had intuited was imminent in both Fascism and Nazism, which were beginning to gain a foothold; he was passionate about the Karaites' language, [[Karaim language|Karaim]], and its Turkish tradition, and somewhat insouciant of the Judaic heritage of his people.  In 1934 [[Corrado Gini]], a distinguished  statistician, interested also in demography and anthropology, with close ties to the fascist elite, led an expedition in August–October 1934 to survey the  [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]]. He concluded that Karaites were  ethnically mixed, predominantly [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] which he mistook to be [[Finno-Ugric]] descendants of the [[Cimmerians|Tauro-Cimmerians]] who at one point had been absorbed into the Khazars who for Gini however were not Turkic. A further conclusion was that the Ashkenazi arose from ‘Turko-Tatar converts to Judaism.’&lt;ref name="Kizilov"&gt;Mikhail Kizilov,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=hGILHIgEl7cC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281 ''The Karaites of Galicia: An Ethnoreligious Minority Among the Ashkenazim, the Turks, and the Slavs, 1772-1945,''] BRILL, 2009 pp.266,269-271,277ff.282, 335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riccardo Calimani, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kMb_CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT583 ''Storia degli ebrei italiani,''] vol.3, Mondadori 2015 p.583.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Khazar-Karaite theory is unsubstantiated by any historical evidence, - the early Karaite literature speaks of Khazars as [[mamzer]]im, 'bastards' or 'strangers' within Judaism - this  myth served a political purpose, of taking that community out of the stranglehold of anti-Semitic regulations and prejudices directed generally against Jews in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Kizilov" /&gt;

===1939–1945===
In 1943, [[Abraham Polak|Abraham N. Polak]] (sometimes referred to as ''Poliak''), later professor of the history of the Middle Ages at [[Tel Aviv University]], published a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[monograph]] in which he concluded that the East European Jews came from Khazaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=29}}. 'Poliak sought the origins of Eastern European Jewry in Khazaria'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sand |2010|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First written as an article in 1941, then as a monograph (1943), it was twice revised in 1944, and 1951 as ''Kazariyah: Toldot mamlacha yehudit be'Eropa'' (Khazaria: History of a Jewish Kingdom in Europe) Mosad Bialik, Tel Aviv, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nazi Germany, unlike most race theorists in Germany down to his time [[Hans F. K. Günther]] argued that the Jews were not a pure race, although he nevertheless considered them to be highly inbred.  He argued that the Ashkenazi were a mix of Near Eastern, Oriental, East Baltic, Eastern, Inner-Asian, Nordic, Hamite, and Negro peoples and separate from the Sephardim. Günther believed that the conversion of the Khazars, whom he took to have been a Near Eastern race  constituted a further external element in the  racial makeup of the Ashkenazi Jews, strengthening its Near Eastern component.&lt;ref name="Steinweis"&gt;{{cite book | title = Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany | author = Alan E. Steinweis | publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMlcJ7QkM_QC&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 32–33}} Günther’s theorizing about racial consequences flowing from the conversion of the Khazars was embraced by [[Gerhard Kittel]].&lt;ref name="Steinweis" /&gt;{{rp| 175 }}

The Karaite claim not to be ethnic Jews, but descendants of the Khazars, was eventually accepted by the Nazis who exempted them, unlike the Crimean [[Krymchak]]s with whom they had historic ties, from the policy of genocidal extermination on these grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bayme [https://books.google.com/books?id=56QJ9O7MFJ4C&amp;pg=PA148 ''Understanding Jewish History: Texts and Commentaries,''] KTAV Publishers 1997 p.148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Raul Hilberg]], ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]],'' (1961) New Viewpoints 1973 p.241.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1946–1949===
In debates leading up to the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN plan in 1947 to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states]], the British politicians [[John Hope Simpson]] and [[Edward Spears]], intent on denying Zionism that part of its claim that drew on biblical arguments, asserted that Jewish immigrants to [[Mandatory Palestine]] were the descendants of pagan converts and not of the Israelites. The approach was one shared by both gentile and Jewish anti-Zionists.

In anti-Zionist argumentation delivered at the UN during 1947 [[Faris al-Khoury]] and [[Jamal Al-Husseini]] used the theory to oppose the creation of a Jewish state on racial and historic grounds. [[Albert Hourani|Cecil Hourani]] claimed that the Arab leaders had been convinced of the value of the argument by [[Benjamin H. Freedman]]. Internal British documents seem to support the claim.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;{{rp| 129}} It would later play a role in [[Arab]] [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] polemics, taking on an antisemitic edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harkabi|1987|p=424}}:"Arab anti-Semitism might have been expected to be free from the idea of racial odium, since Jews and Arabs are both regarded by race theory as Semites, but the odium is directed, not against the Semitic race, but against the Jews as a historical group.

This essay was translated from Harkabi Hebrew text 'Arab Antisemitism' in Shmuel Ettinger, ''Continuity and Discontinuity in Antisemitism,'' (Hebrew) 1968 (p.50).&lt;/ref&gt; though Bernard Lewis, noted in 1987 that serious Arab scholars had dropped it, remarked that it only occasionally emerged in Arab political polemics.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zjkiAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Semites+and+Anti-Semites:+An+Inquiry+into+Conflict+and+Prejudice&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihpsykvO_MAhUGWh4KHTvFDnMQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=khazars&amp;f=false | title = Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry Into Conflict and Prejudice | author= Bernard Lewis | publisher = W.

===1950–1976===
[[D.M. Dunlop]], writing in 1954, thought very little evidence backed what he regarded as a mere assumption, and argued that the Ashkenazi-Khazar descent hypothesis went far beyond what "our imperfect records" permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1954|pp=261,263}}:'.'&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léon Poliakov]], while assuming the Jews of Western Europe resulted from a "panmixia" in the first millennium, asserted in 1955 that it was widely assumed that Europe's Eastern Jews descended from a mixture of Khazarian and [[German Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poliakov|2005|p=285}}:'As for the Jews of Eastern Europe (Poles, Russians, etc.,) it has always been assumed that they descended from an amalgamation of Jews of Khazar stock from southern Russia and German Jews (the latter having imposed their superior culture).'&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Polak|Polak]]'s work found some support from [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]] and [[Ben-Zion Dinur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sand|2010|pp=241–2}}. Sand cites [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]],{{harvnb|Baron|1957|pp=196–206, p.206}}:'before and after the Mongol upheaval the Khazars sent many offshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic lands, helping ultimately to build up the great Jewish center of Eastern Europe'; and [[Ben-Zion Dinur]], ''Yisrael ba-gola'' 5 vols., 3rd ed. (1961-1966) Tel-Aviv: Jerusalem:Dvir;Bialik Institute, 1961. (OCLC:492532282) vol.1 p.2,5:'The Russian conquests did not destroy the Khazar kingdom entirely, but they broke it up and diminished it And this kingdom, which had absorbed Jewish immigration and refugees from many exiles, must itself have become a diaspora mother, the mother of one of the greatest of the diasporas (''Em-galuyot, em akhat hagaluyot hagdolot'')-of Israel in Russia, Lithuania and Poland.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=55}}:’Salo Baron, who incorrectly viewed them as Finno-Ugrians, believed that the Khazars "sent many offshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic lands, helping ultimately to build up the great Jewish centers of eastern Europe’&lt;/ref&gt; but was dismissed by Bernard Weinryb as a fiction (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=55}}:’dismissed. . .rather airily’.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]], called by his biographer an "architect of Jewish history",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liberles|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; devoted a large part of a chapter in his ''Social and Religious History of the Jews'' to the Khazarian Jewish state, and the impact he believed that community exercised on the formation of East European Jewries in his ''Social and Religious History of the Jews'' (1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|1957|pp=196–222}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The scarcity of direct Jewish testimonies did not disconcert Baron: this was to be expected since medieval Jews were "generally inarticulate outside their main centers of learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|1957|p=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Khazarian turn to Judaism was, he judged, the "largest and last mass conversion", involving both the royal house and large sectors of the population. Jews migrated there to flee the recurrent intolerance against Jews and the geopolitical upheavals of the region's chronic wars, which often proved devastating to northern [[Asia Minor]], between [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]], and the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] and [[Ummayad Caliphate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|1957|p=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Baron, the fact of Jewish Khazaria played a lively role in stirring up among Western Jews an image of "[[red Jews]]", and among Jews in [[Islamic countries]] a beacon of hope. After the dissolution of Khazaria, Baron sees a diaspora drifting both north into Russia, Poland and the [[Ukraine]], and westwards into [[Pannonia]] and the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|1957|pp=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; where their cultivated presence both established Jewish communities and paved the way, ironically, for the Slavonic conversion to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|1957|pp=208–210,221}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 11th and 12th centuries, these Eastern Jews make their first appearance in the Jewish literature of France and Germany. [[Maimonides]], bemoaning the neglect of learning in the East, laid his hopes for the perpetuation of Jewish learning in the young struggling communities of Europe but would, Baron concludes, have been surprised to find that within centuries precisely in Eastern Europe would arise thriving communities that were to assume leadership of the Jewish people itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bacon|1957|pp=173,222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Koestler, ''The Thirteenth Tribe'' and contemporary views===
The Khazar-Ashkenazi hypothesis came to the attention of a much wider public with the publication of [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[The Thirteenth Tribe]]'', which made sweeping claims for a Khazar legacy among the Ashkenazi in 1976.&lt;ref name="Sand 2010 240" /&gt;&lt;ref name="harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=9"&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koestler's work was both positively and negatively reviewed. Israel’s ambassador to Britain branded the book "an anti-Semitic action financed by the Palestinians", while [[Bernard Lewis]] claimed that the idea was not supported by any evidence whatsoever, and had been "abandoned by all serious scholars".&lt;ref name="Sand 2010 240" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1987|p=48}}:'Some limit this denial to European Jews and make use of the theory that the Jews of Europe are not of Israelite descent at all but are the offspring of a tribe of Central Asian Turks converted to Judaism, called the Khazars. This theory, first put forward by an Austrian anthropologist in the early years of this century, is supported by no evidence whatsoever. It has long since been abandoned by all serious scholars in the field, including those in Arab countries, where Khazar theory is little used except in occasional political polemics.' Assertions of this kind has been challenged by Paul Wexler{{harvnb|Wexler|2002|pp=538}} who also notes that the arguments on this issue are riven by contrasting ideological investments: "Most writers who have supported the Ashkenazi-Khazar hypothesis have not argued their claims in a convincing manner ... The opponents of the Khazar-Ashkenazi nexus are no less guilty of empty polemics and unconvincing arguments."(p.537).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raphael Patai]], however, registered some support for the idea that Khazar remnants had played a role in the growth of Eastern European Jewish communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patai|Patai|1989|p=71}}: "it is assumed by all historians that those Jewish Khazars who survived the last fateful decades sought and found refuge in the bosom of Jewish communities in the Christian countries to the west, and especially in Russia and Poland, on the one hand, and in the Muslim countries to the east and the south, on the other. Some historians and anthropologists go so far as to consider the modern Jews of East Europe, and more particularly of Poland, the descendants of the medieval Khazars."&lt;/ref&gt; and several amateur researchers, such as Boris Altschüler (1994)&lt;ref name="harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=9" /&gt; and Kevin Alan Brook, kept the thesis in the public eye. Brook's views evolved as new data became available: in the first edition of his book (1999), he contended that about one-fourth of Ashkenazic ancestry may trace back to the Khazars,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brook|1999|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the second edition (2006) he regarded the Khazar contribution as "small"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brook|2009|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the third edition (2018) he argued against any Khazar contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brook|2018|pp=207-208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koestler argued that this theory would mitigate European racially based antisemitism.&lt;ref name="Scammell"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bO7ANkFkH0UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Literary+and+Political+Odyssey+of+a+Twentieth-Century+Skeptic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1uxPVbmgHpKYyATKhYDIBA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Khazars%20&amp;f=false | title = Koestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth-Century Skeptic| author= Michael Scammell | publisher = Random House Publishing Group | year = 2009| page = 546}}: "Every prayer and ritual observance proclaims membership of an ancient race, which automatically separates the Jew from the racial and historic past of the people in whose midst he lives. It sets the Jew apart and invites his being set apart. It automatically creates physical and cultural ghettoes."&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has been used to counter the concept of Jewish nationhood.&lt;ref name="Sand 2010 240" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toch|2012|p=155,n.4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been revived recently in a variety of approaches, from linguistics ([[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]])&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wexler|2007|pp=387–398}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to historiography ([[Shlomo Sand]])&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sand|2010|pp=190–249}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[population genetics]] (Eran Elhaik).&lt;ref name="Elhaik 2012 61–74"&gt;{{harvnb|Elhaik|2012|pp=61–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In broad academic perspective, both the idea that the Khazars converted ''en masse'' to Judaism, and the suggestion that they emigrated to form the core population of Ashkenazi Jewry, remain highly polemical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007 |pp=9–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics and the Khazar theory==
{{See also|Genetic studies on Jews}}
Before modern DNA population genetics entered the field, [[Raphael Patai]] described the Khazars in racial terms as being a Turkic people with some [[Mongoloid]] admixture.&lt;ref name="Patai"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Myth of the Jewish Race |authors= Raphael Patai, Jennifer Patai |publisher= Wayne State University Press |year= 1989 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; After major advances in DNA [[sequence analysis]] and computing technology in the late 20th and early 21st century, a plethora of [[genetic research]] on Jewish and other human populations has been conducted worldwide. The Yiddish scholar [[Alexander Beider]] regards genetic studies as often offering contradictory information, further complicated by the fact that some researchers' work is influenced by personal views.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Beider]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=zWK8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA553 ''Origins of Yiddish Dialects,''] Oxford University Press, 2015 p.553:’Unfortunately, genetic studies on Ashkenazi Jews, numerous since the 1990s, often provide contradictory information. Related methodological issues are huge: no access to the genetic pool of populations who lived centuries before us, the possibility of the genetic variation related to national selection, etc. To these objective problems one should add striking subjective elements: for certain authors, the way they proceed in their investigation and their interpretation of obtained results are clearly skewed by their political and/or religious feelings.'&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Martin B. Richards, presently available genetic studies, including his own study on Ashkenazi maternal lineages, all refute the Khazar theory.&lt;ref name="jewishvoiceny-ashkenazi" /&gt; The claim that Ashkenazis as a whole take their origin from Khazars has been widely criticized as there is no direct evidence to support it.&lt;ref name="Hogenboom"&gt;Melissa Hogenboom, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24442352 'European link to Jewish maternal ancestry] [[BBC News]], 9 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No indication of Khazar genetic ancestry among Ashkenazi Jews |url= http://www.ashg.org/2013meeting/abstracts/fulltext/f130123130.htm |publisher=[[American Society of Human Genetics|ASHG]] |accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using four Jewish groups, one being Ashkenazi, Kopelman ''et al'' found no evidence for the Khazar theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kopelman |first1=NM |last2=Stone |first2=L |last3=Wang |first3=C |title=Genomic microsatellites identify shared Jewish ancestry intermediate between Middle Eastern and European populations |journal=BMC Genetics |volume=10 |page=80 |year=2009 |pmid=19995433 |pmc=2797531 |doi=10.1186/1471-2156-10-80|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nebel study===
In 2001 Nebel et al., summarizing studies that reported a low-level European gene flow contributing to Ashkenazi paternal gene pool, suggested this influence might be reflected in the Eu 19 chromosomes common in Eastern Europe, or otherwise, that Ashkenazim with this component might descend from Khazars, an hypothesis the authors found "attractive".&lt;ref&gt;Almut Nebel, Dvora Filon, Bernd Brinkmann, Partha P.

===Behar study===
In 2003 Behar, remarking on the high frequency haplogroup R1a1 NRYs in that former Khazar sphere of influence and noting [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]]'s theory of relexification, raised the possibility that the Khazar  theory might offer an attractive source for an important eastern component of the Ashkenazim.&lt;ref name="Behar2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Behar DM, Thomas MG, Skorecki K, etal |title=Multiple origins of Ashkenazi Levites: Y chromosome evidence for both Near Eastern and European ancestries |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=768–779 |date=October 2003 |pmid=13680527 |pmc=1180600 |doi=10.1086/378506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein2008"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Goldstein |first=David B. |title=Jacob's legacy: A genetic view of Jewish history |publisher= Yale University Press |year=2008 |pages=location 873 (Kindle for PC) |chapter=3 |isbn=978-0-300-12583-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 [[David B.

A 2013 study by Rootsi, Behar et al. of Ashkenazi Levites (4% of the Jewish male line) found a high frequency of haplogroup R1a-M582 among them (64.9% of Ashkenazi Levites) pointing to a founding event and paternal ancestor common to half of them. Since R1a shows high frequency in Eastern Europe generally, it was thought possible, that the evidence might indicate  the founder was a non-Jewish European. Testing the 3 hypotheses of a European, a Near Eastern or a Khazarian origin, their data excluded both the European and Khazarian origin of a Levite founder  since they found no evidence of R1a-M582 Y-chromosomes was found in either group, other than singletons, while it occurs with significant frequency in Near Eastern  regions [[Kerman|Iranian Kerman]], [[Iranian Azerbaijanis|Iranian Azeri]], the Kurds from Cilician Anatolia and Kazakhstan, and among Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews. R1a-M582  was not detected among data from Iraqi, Bedouins, Druze and Palestinians sampled in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Rootsi, Behar et al., [http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3928 'Phylogenetic applications of whole Y-chromosome sequences and the Near Eastern origin of Ashkenazi Levites,'] Natures Communications  17 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elhaik study===
Eran Elhaik has argued, in two separate papers, the first in 2012 and the latest (2016) co-authored by Wexler, that his genetic analysis strengthens the Khazar hypothesis. Of the 2012 study Elhaik wrote: 

:"Strong evidence for the Khazarian hypothesis is the clustering of European Jews with the populations that in his opinion resided on opposite ends of ancient Khazaria: Armenians, Georgians, and [[Azerbaijani Jews]]. Because Caucasus populations remained relatively isolated in the Caucasus region and because there are no records of Caucasus populations mass-migrating to Eastern and Central Europe prior to the fall of Khazaria (Balanovsky et al. 2011), these findings imply a shared origin for European Jews and Caucasus populations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/61.full]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 study Wexler, Elhaik, et al. argued that the first Ashkenazi populations to speak the Yiddish language came from areas near four villages in Eastern Turkey along the Silk Road whose names derived from the word "Ashkenaz," rather than from Germanic lands as is the general consensus in scholarship. Elhaik and Wexler proposed a variant for the canonical Khazarian hypothesis, proposing that Iranians, Greeks, Turks, and Slavs converted to Judaism in Anatolia prior to migrating to Khazaria where a small-scale conversion had already occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-04/20/yiddish-origin-turkey-dna-analysis|last=Burgess|first=Matt|date=20 April 2016|title=Yiddish may have originated in Turkey, not Germany|website=Wired.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=R.|last2=Wexler|first2=P.|last3=Pirooznia|first3=M.|last4=Elhaik|first4=E.|year=2016|title=Localizing Ashkenazic Jews to primeval villages in the ancient Iranian lands of Ashkenaz|journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|volume=8|issue=4|pages=1132–1149|url=http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/4/1132.full|doi=10.1093/gbe/evw046|pmid=26941229|pmc=4860683}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Bernard Spolsky commenting on Elhaik’s earlier study wrote. “Recently, Elhaik (2013) claims to have found evidence supporting the Khazarian origin of Ashkenazim, but the whole issue of genetic evidence remains uncertain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spolsky|2014|p=297 n.12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stampfer study===
In June 2014, [[Shaul Stampfer]] published a paper challenging the Khazar hypothesis as ungrounded in sources contemporary with the Khazar period, stating: "Such a conversion, even though it’s a wonderful story, never happened".&lt;ref name="Aderet"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aderet|first1=Ofer|title=Jews are not descended from Khazars, Hebrew University historian says|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/1.601287|accessdate=1 October 2014|work=Haaretz|date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shaul Stampfer]], [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jewish_social_studies/v019/19.3.stampfer.pdf "Did the Khazars Convert to Judaism?,"] Jewish Social Studies: History, Culture, Society 19 (3) pp.1–72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the Elhaik study===
Elhaik's 2012 study proved highly controversial. Several noted geneticists, among them [[Marcus Feldman]], [[Harry Ostrer]] and [[Michael Hammer (geneticist)|Michael Hammer]] have maintained - and the view has gained widespread support among scientists - that the worldwide Jewish population is homogeneous and shares common roots in the [[Middle East]], Feldman stated Elhaik's statistical analysis would not pass muster with most scientists; Hammer affirmed it was an outlier minority view without scientific support. Elhaik in reply described the group as ‘liars’ and ‘frauds’, noting Ostrer would not share genetic data that might be used ‘to defame the Jewish people’. Elhaik’s PhD supervisor [[Dan Graur]], likewise dismissed them as  a ‘clique’, and said Elhaik is ‘combative’ which is what science itself is.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Rubin, [http://forward.com/news/israel/175912/jews-a-race-genetic-theory-comes-under-fierce-atta/?p=all ‘Jews a Race’ Genetic Theory Comes Under Fierce Attack by DNA Expert,'] [[The Forward]] 7 May  2013 &lt;/ref&gt;

Elhaik's 2012 study was specifically criticized for its use of Armenians and Azerbaijani Jews as proxies for Khazars and for using [[Bedouin]] and [[Jordan]]ian [[Hashemites]] as a proxy for the Ancient Israelites. The former decision was criticized because Armenians were assumed to have a monolithic Caucasian ancestry, when as an [[Anatolian people]] (rather than Turkic) they contain many genetically Middle Eastern elements. Azerbaijani Jews are also assumed for the purposes of the study to have Khazarian ancestry, when [[Mountain Jews]] are actually descended from [[Persian Jews]]. The decision to cast Bedouin/Hashemites as "proto-Jews" was especially seen as political in nature, considering that both have origins in [[Arab tribes]] from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] rather than from the Ancient Israelites, while the descent of the Jews from the Israelites is largely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Terra-Incognita-The-return-of-the-Khazar-myth Terra Incognita: Return of the Khazar Myth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&amp;context=humbiol_preprints No Evidence of Genome Wide Khazar Origin of Modern Jews]&lt;/ref&gt; The study was also criticized as interpreting information selectively—The study found far more genetic similarity between the [[Druze]] and Ashkenazim than the Ashkenazim and Armenians, but Elhaik rejected this as indicating a common Semitic origin, instead interpreting it as evidence of Druze having Turkic origins when they are known to come from Syria.

Geneticists conducting studies in Jewish genetics have challenged Elhaik's methods in his first paper. Michael Hammer called Elhaik's premise "unrealistic," calling Elhaik and other Khazarian hypothesis proponents "outlier folks… who have a minority view that’s not supported scientifically. I think the arguments they make are pretty weak and stretching what we know." [[Marcus Feldman]], director of [[Stanford University]]'s Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies, echoes Hammer. "If you take all of the careful genetic population analysis that has been done over the last 15 years… there’s no doubt about the common Middle Eastern origin," he said. He added that Elhaik’s first paper "is sort of a one-off." Elhaik’s statistical analysis would not pass muster with most contemporary scholars, Feldman said: "He appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data." &lt;ref name="rubin"&gt;Rita Rubin, [http://forward.com/news/israel/175912/jews-a-race-genetic-theory-comes-under-fierce-atta/?p=all 'Jews a Race' Genetic Theory Comes Under Fierce Attack by DNA Expert,']. ''[[The Forward]]'', 7 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elhaik and Wexler's 2016 study was challenged by two prominent scholars of Jewish demography from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Shaul Stampfer, a professor of Soviet and East European Jewry, deemed it “basically nonsense.” Sergio DellaPergola, the primary demographer of the Jewish people at the university, called it a "falsification", criticizing its methodology, using a small population size and selectively removing population groups that refuted the findings they wanted, namely other Jewish groups such as the [[Italkim]] and [[Sephardic Jews]], to whom Ashkenazi Jews are closely related genetically. “Serious research would have factored in the glaring genetic similarity between Sephardim and Ashkenazim, which mean Polish Jews are more genetically similar to Iraqi Jews than to a non-Jewish Pole.”&lt;ref name="jta" /&gt; Elhaik replied that “studying the DNA of non-Ashkenazic Jews would not change the DNA of Ashkenazic Jews nor the predicted origin of their DNA.'.&lt;ref name="jta"&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/prominent-scholars-blast-theory-tracing-ashkenazi-jews-to-turkey/ Prominent scholars blast theory tracing Ashkenazi Jews to Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a study by a team of biologists and linguists, led by Pavel Flegontov, a specialist in genomics, published a response to Das, Elhaik and Wexler's 2016 study, criticizing their methodology and conclusions. They argue that GPS allows inferences works for the origins of modern populations with an unadmixed genome, but not for tracing ancestries back 1,000 years ago. In their view, the paper tried to fit Wexler's  'marginal and unsupported interpretation' of Yiddish into a model that only permits valid deductions for recent unadmixed populations.

==Antisemitism==
{{Antisemitism}}
===United Kingdom and United States===
Maurice Fishberg and Roland B. Dixon's works were later exploited in racist and religious polemical literature, by advocates of [[British Israelism]], in both [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|2006|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly after the publication of [[Burton J. Hendrick]] ‘s ''The Jews in America'' (1923)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singerman|2004|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it began to enjoy a vogue among advocates of immigration restrictions in the 1920s; racial theorists&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barkun|2012|p=165}}:'Although the Khazar theory gets surprisingly little attention in scholarly histories of anti-Semitism, it has been an influential theme among American anti-Semites since the immigration restrictionists of the 1920s,'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2002|p=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; like [[Lothrop Stoddard]]; antisemitic [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] like the [[Ku Klux Klan]]’s [[Hiram Wesley Evans]]; and [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] polemicists like John O. Beaty&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boller |1992|pp=2,6–7}}; {{harvnb|Barkun |1997|pp=141–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Ezra Pound]], then strongly identifying with the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] regime of [[Benito Mussolini]], sent a query to fellow poet [[Louis Zukofsky]] concerning the Khazars after someone had written to him claiming that the ancient Jews had died out and that modern Jews were of Khazar descent. He returned to the issue in 1955, apparently influenced by a book called ''Facts are Facts'', which pushed the Jewish-Khazar descent theory, and which for Pound had dug up "a few savoury morsels".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pound|Zukovsky|1987|p=xxi}}, citing letterd of 10 July 1938 and 24/25 September 1955. Ahearn speculates that Pound may have thought:'If there were no such people as Jews, then the problem of indiscriminate anti-Semitism would disappear. On could focus one’s attention on usurers of whatever description.'&lt;/ref&gt; The booklet in question, by a [[Roman Catholic]] convert from [[Rabbinic Judaism]] [[Benjamin H. Freedman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freedman|1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an anti-Semitic tirade written to [[David Goldstein (Catholic apologist)|David Goldstein]] after the latter had converted to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaplan|1997|p=191 n.3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

John O. Beaty was an antisemitic, [[McCarthyism|McCarthyite]] professor of [[Old English]] at [[Southern Methodist University|SMU]], author of ''The Iron Curtain over America'' (Dallas 1952). According to him, "the Khazar Jews were responsible for all of America's – and the world's ills," beginning with [[World War I]]. The book had little impact until the former Wall Street broker and oil tycoon J. Russell Maguire promoted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boller|2013|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar position was adopted by Wilmot Robertson, whose views influenced [[David Duke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barkun|1997|pp=140–141}}. His ''Dispossessed Majority'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; The British author [[Douglas Reed]] has also been influential. In his work the Ashkenazi are false Jews, descendants of the Khazars.&lt;ref name ="Papers"/&gt;{{rp| 355}}

A number of different variants of the theory came to be exploited by the [[Christian Identity]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barkun |1997|pp=140–144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian Identity movement, which took shape from the 1940s to the 1970s, had its roots in British Israelism which had been planted on American evangelical soil in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2002|p=165}}.'The formative period of Christian Identity could roughly be said to be the three decades between 1940 and 1970. Through missionaries like [[Wesley A. Swift|Wesley Swift]], Bertrand Comparet and William Potter Gale, it took on a white [[Racialism|racialist]], [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Conservatism|conservative]] political outlook. Combined with the teachings of early disciples [[Richard Girnt Butler|Richard G. Butler]], Colonel Jack Mohr and James K. Warner, a distinctly [[Racism|racist]] [[theology]] was gradually formed. [[White people|Whites]] were said to be the Adamic people, created in His likeness. A notion of a pre-earthly existence is found in an important substratum, teaching that whites either had a spiritual or extraterrestrial pre-existence. Blacks were either [[Pre-Adamite|pre-Adamic]] soulless creatures or represented fallen, evil spirits, but they were not the chief target of fear and hatred. This position was reserved for Jews. The latent anti-Semitism found in British-Israelism rose to prominence. Jews were, at best, reduced to mongrelized imposters, not infrequently identified with Eurasian Khazars without any legitimate claim to a closeness with [[God]], and at worst denounced as the offspring of [[Satan]].'&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s the Khazar ancestry theory was an article of faith in the Christian Identity movement.&lt;ref name ="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xaiaM77s6N4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Black-Sun-Esoteric-Politics-Identity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlsuv1ge3MAhWJMj4KHTwZDUEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=khazars%20&amp;f=false| title = Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity |author= [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]|publisher = NYU Press| page = 237| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian Identity]] movement has associated two verses from the [[New Testament]], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2%3A9&amp;version=KJV Revelation 2:9] and [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3%3A9&amp;version=KJV 3:9] with the Khazars. [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]] calls these two passages the corner stone of Identity theology. He also reports that Christian Identity literature makes selective references to the [[Babylonian Talmud]], while the works of Francis Parker Yockey and Arthur Koestler work are raised almost to the status of Holy Writ.&lt;ref name =" Kaplan "&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qIilYBbxSbcC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=khazars+revelation+2:9&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR2OufwdXMAhVHOCYKHZfmA1U4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=identty&amp;f=false | title = Radical Religion in America: Millenarian Movements from the Far Right to the Children of Noah | author= Jeffrey Kaplan | publisher = Syracuse University Press | year = 1997 | pages = 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union and Russia===
The theory was prominent in Soviet antisemitism, gaining a place in Soviet historiography. The theory influenced Soviet historians including [[Boris Rybakov]], [[Mikhail Illarionovich Artamonov|Mikhail Artamonov]] and [[Lev Gumilyov]] and was used to support soviet political theory.&lt;ref name ="Zhivkov"/&gt;{{rp| Vii-Viii }} Artamonov argued that the Khazars had played an important role in the development of Rus’. A view that Rybakov disputed instead regarding the Khazar state as parasitic.&lt;ref name ="klejn"&gt;{{cite book | title = Soviet Archaeology: Trends, Schools, and History | author= Leo S. Klejn | publisher = OUP Oxford| year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 260–261}} Official Soviet views on the Khazars hardened after December 1951 when [[Pravda]] published a critical review of Artamonov's work under the pen name P. Ivanov.&lt;ref name ="Tillett"&gt;{{cite book | title = The great friendship: Soviet historians on the non-Russian nationalities| author= Lowell Tillett| publisher = University of North Carolina Press | year = 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 313–314}} Rybakov for his part denied that he was Ivanov.&lt;ref name ="klejn"/&gt;{{rp| 261}} It has been speculated that Ivanov was in fact Stalin. In Ivanov’s review the Khazars were regarded as parasites and enemies.&lt;ref name ="sand"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Invention of the Jewish People| author= Shlomo Sand | publisher = Verso| year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 237 }} Ivanov’s views became the certified Soviet position.&lt;ref name ="Tillett"/&gt;{{rp| 314}}

Lev Gumilyov’s theory of ethnogenesis draws heavily on the Khazars theory. For Gumilyov ethnicity was defined by stereotypical behavior which was linked to adaption to the terrain.&lt;ref name ="Rossman"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EnsHyxPZfOIC&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title = Russia Between East and West: Scholarly Debates on Eurasianism | editor= Dmitry Shlapentokh | publisher = BRILL| year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 121–122}} Jews, he regarded as a parasitic, international urban class.&lt;ref name ="Zubok"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rZ-usH8e6AEC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;dq=Lev+Gumilyov+parasitic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVwbvLtt3MAhWCax4KHaIBAz0Q6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Lev%20Gumilyov%20parasitic&amp;f=false| title = Zhivago's Children | author= Vladislav Zubok|publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 2009| page = 308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews had dominated the Khazars creating a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]], subjecting Rus’ to the "Khazar Yoke."&lt;ref name ="Papers"/&gt;{{rp| 358–359, 368}}

Since the 1970s the term Khazars has entered the Russian nationalist lexicon, it is used as a euphemism for Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shnirelman|2007|p=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Vadim V. Kozhinov theorized that the Khazar Yoke was more dangerous to Rus´ than the Tatar Yoke.&lt;ref name ="Rossman2"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pF-I25OC5ugC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Khazar+soviet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj8fOF_NzMAhWFph4KHcg4CE0Q6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Khazar%20soviet&amp;f=false | title = Russian Intellectual Antisemitism in the Post-Communist Era| author= Vadim Joseph Rossman | publisher = U of Nebraska Press| year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 90}} The Khazars were imagined as a persistent danger to Rus’.&lt;ref name ="Papers"/&gt;{{rp| 359}} After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] the theory maintained a role in Russian antisemitism.

===Cults===
[[Aum Shinrikyo]] is a Japanese [[doomsday cult]]. The cult was active in Japan and Russia, with an estimated 10,000 and 30,000 followers respectively.&lt;ref name ="Knox"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jrWrbJAIyHQC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=aum+shinrikyo+russia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhxP2yzd3MAhWD7SYKHclQAYwQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aum%20shinrikyo%20russia&amp;f=false| title = Russian Society and the Orthodox Church: Religion in Russia After Communism | author= Zoe Knox|publisher = Routledge| year = 2004| page = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups “Manual of Fear” used the Protocols of the Elders of Zion in addition to other anti-Semitic material. The manual claimed that the Jews are really Khazars intent on world domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|Miyazawi |2000|pp=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Dikötter"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys5oy66VjisC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=Aum+khazar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLg7eCzt3MAhVKSyYKHdC_AYcQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Aum%20khazar&amp;f=false| title = The Construction of Racial Identities in China and Japan: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives|editor= Frank Dikötter|publisher = University of Hawaii Press| year = 1997| page = 196}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Khazar theory has also become part of the [[Ascended Master Teachings|Ascended Masters]] theology. [[Master Jesus#Hatonn and the photon belt|Hatonn]], an extraterrestrial, transmits messages including the complete text of [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]. He identifies the authors of The Protocols as Khazars and speaks of false Zionist Jews who have usurped and controlled the true Jews.&lt;ref name ="Katz"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AQcUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=khazars+anti+semitism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSy7bgrN3MAhWHlR4KHV4iD7w4ChDoAQgsMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=khazars%20anti%20semitism&amp;f=false| title = The Paranoid Apocalypse: A Hundred-Year Retrospective on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion | editor = Richard Landes |editor2=Steven T.

'''Knud Arne Jürgensen''' (born 1952) is a Danish music-, opera-, ballet- and theater historian, dramaturg, curator of exhibitions, senior researcher, dr. phil.

== Biography ==
Jürgensen studied music and theater history at the University of Copenhagen from 1975 and for seven years, but had previously to his studies in musicology studied piano with professor [http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/1541/origin/170/ Galina Werschenska] and later at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] in Copenhagen. The combination of research in the fields of music, theater and dance has followed him since.

During two periods in the late 1980s and mid-1990s, Knud Arne Jürgensen was a research fellow of the Danish [[Carlsberg Foundation]]. The work resulted in three English-language monographs on the Danish dancer, choreographer and ballet master [[August Bournonville]], on whom Jürgensen has continued to work extensively which his considerable [http://www.knudarnejurgensen.dk/home/bibliography list of publications] and several exhibitions testify to. An international theme exhibition at the [[Royal Danish Library]], and a poster exhibition at The [[Royal Danish Theatre]] were carried out in the Bournonville jubilee-year 2005 marking the bicentenary of his birth.

When Knud Arne Jürgensen in 1997 made his doctoral thesis (dr. phil., equivalent to Doctor of Music), it was with a music and theater historical thesis on the composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and the ballets in his operas, which resulted in Verdi ballet performances at the [[Berlin State Opera]] in 1999 (the ballet "Verdiana") and the [http://www.wiener-staatsoper.at/Content.Node/home/Startseite-Content.de.php Vienna State Opera] in 2001 ("Verdi Ballet: Ein Maskenball"). He has furthermore written in-depth biographies of danish theater critics [[Herman Bang]], [[Frederik Schyberg]] and [[Jens Kistrup]] and was chief editor and program author when the complete orchestral works by danish composer [[Hans Christian Lumbye]] were recorded during the period 1998-2004. In addition, he has reconstructed a number of forgotten choreographies of August Bournonville following the choreographer's original records.

Knud Arne Jürgensen was also co-editor of the orchetral scores for the Bournonville ballet ''[[A Folk Tale (Et folkesagn)]]'' and a number of [http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/udgivelser/lumbye/index.html Lumbye works] as a gift from the [[Royal Danish Library]] to Her Majesty [[Queen Margrethe II]] on her 60th birthday in 2000 and 70th birthday in 2010. Recently he has edited the CD-recording of Lumbye-works ''Fredensborgdage'' for the Royal Danish Lifeguards as a present on the occasion of Her Majesty [[Queen Margrethe II's]] 75th birthday in 2015.

== Professional career ==
Jürgensen was from 1998 to 2010 Head of the [[Drama Collection]], research librarian, senior researcher and subject specialist in theater and performing arts at the [[Royal Danish Library]]. Since 2010, he has worked as exhibition curator, senior researcher and subject specialist at the Copenhagen [[Theatre Museum in the Court Theatre]], where he has completed his most recent monographs on the late Danish theater critic Jens Kistrup, (published in 2012), and the first complete and annotated edition of the plays by Danish impressionist writer, Herman Bang (published in 2016).

He has also been a Fellow at the [http://www.acdan.it/ Danish Academy in Rome] from 2011 to 2012, where he has been working on editing and publishing the score for the Italian baroque opera ''[http://www.edizioniquasar.it/sku.php?id_libro=1970 Il Valdemaro]'' by the Neapolitan composer [[Domenico Sarro]], a work that represents one of the earliest operas based on a Scandinavian theme, and which appeared for the first time on print in a new critical edition in 2013.

Knud Arne Jürgensen, who has been a member and trustee of several professional boards, has published more than 30 Danish and international monographs in the field of music history and the performing arts and well over hundred scientific papers and essays. He has curated more than 20 Danish and international thematic exhibitions, guest lectured at the [http://www.ku.dk/english University of Copenhagen] as well as at a large number of foreign universities, museums and theater institutions in the United States, Russia, Austria, Italy, France and Germany.

The '''Kulmer Steig''' is a byword for transport links from the [[Elbe|Elbe valley]] over the eastern part of the [[Eastern Ore Mountains]] to Bohemian [[Chlumec u Chabařovic]] (German: ''Kulm''), hence the name which means "Kulm Trail". It is an [[ancient road]] system of partly derelict and unmetalled historic transport routes. These historic long-distance routes have been uncovered today thanks to archaeological discoveries. The routes all head south from the Elbe valley between [[Dresden]] and [[Pirna]] and cross the Eastern Ore Mountains over  [[Ore Mountain passes|mountain passes]] on the Saxon side between Fürstenwalde in the west and [[Bad Gottleuba-Berggießhübel#Oelsen|Oelsen]] in the east. The lowest crossings are located near [[Mohelnice (Krupka)|Mohelnice]] from where they continue via [[Habartice (Krupka)|Habartice]] and the Geiersberg as well as Krasný Les and further on over the [[Nollendorf Pass]] to Chlumec. The Kulmer Steig was an especially good transport route because the road cut a passage through untamed wilderness and 30 kilometres could be covered in a day.

In places it overlaps with the Old Kings Way (''Alter Königsweg'' or ''[[Via Regia]]'') from [[Cologne]] to [[Kraków]] and [[Berlin]] to [[Prague]] and the [[Salt Road]] (''Salzstraße'') from [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] to Prague.

== Route ==
From a cursory examination of the geography one may wonder why the direct route from [[Dresden]] to [[Bohemia]] running south 
through the [[Ore Mountains]] was not preferred, or even a route along the banks of the Elbe.
[[File:Kulmer_Steig.jpg|thumb|220px|Ancient road system of the Kulmer Steig: main route (red), eastern route (blue), western route (green), branches (yellow)]]

Both routes had major disadvantages. The one from Dresden running south over the Freital Heights (''Freitaler Höhen'') crosses the Ore Mountains near [[Zinnwald (Altenberg)|Zinnwald/Cínovec]] at a height of at least 850&amp;nbsp;metres above sea level (at ''Cínovec''). The ascents and the descent on the Bohemian side are very steep in places and the climatic conditions, especially in winter, are rather severe, as users of the [[Bundesstraße 170|B&amp;nbsp;170]] federal road still experience today in the Altenberg/Zinnwald area each winter. The riverbank route close to the Elbe, by contrast, runs through a canyon-like ravine in [[Bohemian Switzerland]] which, taking into account security considerations, was viewed as rather unsafe by travelling merchants. All the more because the sparsely populated region offered little protection. The castles in [[Saxon Switzerland|Saxon]] and Bohemian Switzerland, especially after the impoverishment of their noble owners in the 15th century, also tended to favour robber baronies rather than protection of the trading routes.

The use of the eastern part of the East Ore Mountains, despite being something of a detour, only had moderate gradients and more favourable weather conditions. The crest itself was only about 700&amp;nbsp;m above sea level at the Nakléřov Pass.

Dohna formed an outstandingly well protected entrance into the Mohelnice valley with its castles on the Robisch and the Reichsburg on the  Schlossberg opposite and enabled a very safe passage and crossing of the lower Eastern Ore Mountains. From here there were several different route options:

*Eastern route: Zehista – Dohma – Ottendorf – Gersdorf – Gottleuba – Oelsen – Krásný Les – Nakléřov – Chlumec
*Main route: Köttewitz – Meusegast – Niederseidewitz – Ottendorf – Gersdorf – Gottleuba – Oelsen – Krásný Les – Nakléřov – Chlumec
*Western route: Köttewitz – Meusegast – Niederseidewitz – Nentmannsdorf – Herbergen – Liebstadt – Börnersdorf – Breitenau – Krásný Les – Nakléřov – Chlumec

[[File:Höhenprofil_Kulmer_Steig.png|thumb|left|400px|Section through the Kulmer Steig (main route)]]

Pirna as well, with its [[ford (river crossing)|ford]] over the Elbe, offered a good entry point into this mountain range crossing, especially in the [[Late Middle Ages]] following the [[Dohna Feud]], when Dohna lost its position to Pirna. However, this approach probably did not go via Zehista, but ran somewhat to the east via the plateau at Kohlberg and then reached Dohma before following the eastern route thereafter.

In addition to these major arteries, there was a multitude of branch routes, e.&amp;nbsp;g.

*from Breitenau via Fürstenwalde, Müglitz and Ebersdorf to Chlumec, 
*from Herbergen via Göppersdorf to Börnersdorf or
*from Gottleuba via Hellendorf and [[Petrovice (Ústí nad Labem District)|Petrovice]] to Nakléřov.

These transport corridors were upgraded with the arrival of more modern modes of transport. For example, the [[Old Dresden to Teplitz Post Road|Old and New Dresden to Teplitz Post Road]]. But even the present-day roads use these corridors, for example the [[Bundesautobahn 17|A 17 motorway]].

== Chronology ==
The location of some of the highways outlined above can be worked out even for prehistoric times. This is evinced, ''inter alia'', by archaeological finds (pottery, coins, even from Roman times, tools, weapons) from the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] (ca. 1800-750 BC) and [[Iron Age]] (750 BC - early AD). Even a few finds from the [[Neolithic]] ([[Stone Age]] ca 4500-1800 BC) show statistically significant associations with the above-described routes of the Kulmer Steig.

In the Middle Ages, the route served as a trading and military road. According to tradition, the Kulmer Steig was used as early as 805 and 856 by armies advancing into Bohemia. The first records of such use, however, date to 1040, when Margrave [[Eckhard II of Meissen]] with the Saxon army and a force under Archbishop [[Bardo of Mainz]] advanced into Bohemia and intervened in the dispute between [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] and [[Bretislaus I]] The eastward expansion of Henry I may also have followed this route, especially since he also credited with the establishment of [[Dohna Castle]] in 930 (other sources identify [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] as founding it around 960, perhaps this is a misunderstanding with regard to the castle on the Robisch and the Reichsburg opposite on the Schlossberg). It is recorded that [[Henry I of East Francia|Henry I]] founded [[Meissen]] Castle in 929 and in the same year moved on to Bohemia. Other armies were moved down this route by [[Wiprecht of Groitzsch]] in 1107 and Emperor [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair III]] in 1126.

These transport routes also played an important role in the great wars of the Middle Ages. Armies in the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Seven Years' War]] and during the [[Napoleonic Wars|wars of liberation from Napoleonic occupation]], particularly around the year 1813, used these routes for crossing the Ore Mountains and regularly brought death, misery and devastation to the region.

With the introduction of road tolls in the 14th century and also the construction of post roads in the 18th century and modern roads since the early 19th century, the old road system described above, with its sunken roads shaped by centuries of heavy carts, disappeared.

In the later Middle Ages, these trade routes increasingly concentrated on the post roads (e.g. the [[Old Dresden to Teplitz Post Road|Old and New Dresden to Teplitz Post Road]]) with their surveys and designations made by [[Adam Friedrich Zürner]] in 1712/13 on behalf of the Saxon Elector [[August II of Poland|August the Strong]].

The modern road network emerged in the 19th and 20th century. It is based, as mentioned above, on the described routes of the Kulmer Steig (e.g. ''[[Staatstraße]]'' 173 from Pirna to the border crossing at Bahratal; ''[[Kreisstraße]]'' 8760 from Pirna to Herbergen; ''Kreisstraße'' 8770 from Dohna via Köttewitz into the Seidewitz valley, ''Staatstraße'' 176 from Pirna through the Seidewitz valley to [[Liebstadt]] and on to Börnersdorf and Breitenau, and, of course, the [[Bundesautobahn 17|A 17 autobahn]], which runs parallel to the Old Dresden to Teplitz Post Road, etc.).

In several cities there are imitations of Stolpersteine although the concept of Gunter Demnig is protected by copyright and registered as a [[Trademark]] all over Europe.

* [[Austria]]: In Vienna there are more 1.000 memorial plaques dedicated to the victims of the Nazi regime.
* [[Belgium]]: Imitations are collocated in [[Mechelen]] in [[Flanders]].
* [[Czech Republic]]: Imitations can be found in [[Benešov]], [[Brno]], [[Liberec]] and [[Židlochovice]]. Though, the majority of the Brno memorial plaques are original Stolpersteine by Demnig himself.
* [[Netherlands]]: Imitations can be found in a.o. [[Amersfoort]], [[Bellingwedde]], [[Veendam]] and [[Vught]]. They are called "Herdenkingstenen" and are made of black [[Marble|marmor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29240">{{For|estimations of per-capita GDP in history|List of regions by past GDP (PPP) per capita}}
	
These are '''lists of regions and countries by their estimated [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real]] [[gross domestic product]] (GDP)''' in terms of [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), the value of all final goods and services produced within a country/region in a given year. GDP dollar ([[international dollar]]) estimates here are derived from PPP estimates.

== Methodology ==
In the absence of sufficient data for nearly all economies until well into the 19th century, past GDP cannot be calculated, but at best only roughly estimated. In a first step, economic historians try to reconstruct the [[GDP per capita]] for a given political or geographical entity from the meagre evidence. This value is then multiplied by estimated [[population]] size, another determinant for which as a rule only little ancient data is available.

A key notion in the whole process is that of [[subsistence]], the [[income]] level which is necessary for sustaining one's life. Since [[pre-modern societies]], by modern standards, were characterized by a very low degree of [[urbanization]] and a large majority of people working in the [[agricultural sector]], economic historians prefer to express income in [[cereal]] units. To achieve comparability over space and time, these numbers are then converted into monetary units such as International Dollars, a third step which leaves a relatively wide margin of interpretation.

The formula thus is: GDP (PPP) = GDP per capita (PPP) x population size

It should be stressed that, historically speaking, population size is the far more important multiplier in the equation. This is because, in contrast to [[Industrial age|industrial economies]], the average income ceiling of premodern [[agrarian societies]] was quite low everywhere, possibly not higher than twice the subsistence level.&lt;ref&gt;Milanovic 2006, p. 460, 468: {{quote|In conclusion, the fact that the average incomes in the most developed agricultural economies like [[Augustus|Augustan]] [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Basil II|Basil]]'s [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] were about twice or less than the subsistence minimum might indicate that the [[pre-industrial societies]] were unlikely to ever exceed that ceiling. This in turn has implications for our assessment of the average standard of living in other, non-Western, pre-industrial economies like those of China, India, [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian Americas]], and [[Africa]]....A further implication of these calculations is that a realistic maximum income that could be envisaged for the pre-industrial societies might be a bit more than twice the subsistence minimum, or around $PPP 1000 (at 1990 international prices).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the total GDP as given below primarily reflects the respective historical population size, and is much less indicative of contemporary [[living standard]]s than, for example, [[List of regions by past GDP (PPP) per capita|estimations of past GDP per capita]] are.

According to the 20th-century macroeconomist [[Paul Bairoch]], a pioneer in historical economic analysis, 
{{quote|it is obvious that by itself the volume of total [[GNP]] has no important significance, and that the volume of GNP is not by itself the expression of the economic strength of a nation.}}

Rather, Bairoch advocates a formula combining GNP per capita and total GNP to give a better measure of the economic performance of national economies.&lt;ref&gt;Bairoch 1976, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

== World ==
=== 1750–1990 (Bairoch) ===
In his 1995 book ''Economics and World History'', economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] gave the following estimates in terms of 1960 [[US dollars]], for [[Gross national income|GNP]] from 1750 to 1990, comparing what are today the [[Third World]] ([[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Latin America]]) and the [[First World]] ([[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Japan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|page=95|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''A''' {{Note|note_a2}} From 1 AD to 1913 AD, India includes modern [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]]. From 1950 onwards, India refers only to the modern [[Republic of India]].&lt;/small&gt;

Maddison' assumptions have been criticized and admired by academics and journalists. By Bryan Haig, who has characterized Maddison's figures for 19th century Australia as "inaccurate and irrelevant",&lt;ref&gt;Haig, Bryan.  2005. "Review of ''The World Economy: Historical Statistics'' by Angus Maddison," ''Economic Reports'', volume 81.&lt;/ref&gt;, by [[W. W. Rostow]], according to whom "this excessive macroeconomic bias also causes him (Maddison) to mis-date, in my view, the beginning of what he calls the capitalist era at 1820 rather than, say, the mid-1780s."&lt;ref&gt;[[W. W. Rostow|Rostow, W. W.]]. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2121934 "Reviewed Work(s): ''Phases of Capitalist Development.'' by Angus Maddison,"] ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 45, No. 4. (Dec., 1985), pp. 1026-1028.&lt;/ref&gt;

W. J. MacPherson has described Maddison's work on India and Pakistan of using "dubious comparative data."&lt;ref&gt;MacPherson, W. J.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2231352 "Reviewed Work(s): ''Class Structure and Economic Growth. India and Pakistan since the Moghuls'' by Angus Maddison."] ''The Economic Journal'', Vol. 82, No. 328. (Dec., 1972), pp. 1470-1472.&lt;/ref&gt; Maddison's estimates have also been critically reviewed and revised by the Italian economists Giovanni Federico&lt;ref&gt;Federico 2002, pp. 111–120&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elio Lo Cascio]]/[[Paolo Malanima]] (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Lo Cascio, Malanima Dec. 2009, pp. 391–420&lt;/ref&gt;

However, economist and journalist [[Evan Davis (journalist)|Evan Davis]] has praised Maddison's research by citing it as a "fantastic publication" and that it was "based on the detailed scholarship of the world expert on historical economic data Angus Maddison." He also added that "One shouldn't read the book in the belief the statistics are accurate to 12 decimal places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4337203.stm | work=BBC News | title=China's magnificent historic past | date=2005-03-10 | accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe ==

=== 1830–1938 (Bairoch) ===
The following estimates were made by the economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]].&lt;ref&gt;Bairoch 1976, pp. 281, table 4; 295, table 10&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to most other estimates on this page, the GNP (at market prices) is given here in [[United States dollar|1960 US dollars]]. Unlike Maddison, Bairoch allows for the fluctuation of borders, basing his estimates mostly on the historical boundaries at the given points in time.&lt;ref name="Western and Eastern Europe"&gt;The border between "Western Europe" and "Eastern Europe" as defined by Bairoch corresponds to the [[iron curtain]], with "Eastern Europe" being identical to the [[Eastern Bloc]] (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the [[German Democratic Republic]], Hungary, Romania, Poland, and the USSR plus [[Albania]]). All the rest of Europe makes up "Western Europe" (Bairoch 1976, pp. 317, 319).&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Empire and India===
Goedele De Keersmaeker estimated the GDP of the [[British Empire]] using Angus Maddison's data. Keersmaeker estimated that the British Empire's share of world GDP was 24.28% in 1870 and 19.7% in 1913. The empire's largest economy in 1870 was [[British India]] with a 12.15% share of world GDP, followed by the [[United Kingdom]] with a 9.03% share. The empire's largest economy in 1913 was the United Kingdom with a 8.22% share of world GDP, followed by British India with a 7.47% share.&lt;ref name="Keersmaeker"&gt;Goedele De Keersmaeker (2017), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y_eoDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 ''Polarity, Balance of Power and International Relations Theory: Post-Cold War and the 19th Century Compared'', page 90], [[Springer Science+Business Media]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman/Byzantine Empire ===
{{See also|Roman economy|Byzantine economy}}

Much work in estimating past GDP has been done in the study of the [[Roman economy]], following the pioneering studies by [[Keith Hopkins]] (1980) and [[Raymond W.

The GDP per capita of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the continuation of the Roman Empire in the east, has been estimated by the [[World Bank]] economist Branko Milanović to range between $680 and 770 (in 1990 International Dollars) at its peak around 1000 AD, that is the reign of [[Basil II]].&lt;ref&gt;Milanovic 2006, p. 468&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine population size at the time is estimated to have been 12 to 18 million.&lt;ref&gt;Milanovic 2006, p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; This would yield a total GDP somewhere between $8,160 and 13,860 million.

=== ''Witch Craze'' ===
In 2004 Roper published ''Witch Craze: Terror and Fantasy in Baroque Germany'', a study of the [[Witch trials in the early modern period|Burning Times]] of persecution of people as witches in Germany in the 16th and 17th centuries in an attempt to understand why it took place at that particular time, why it was not geographically universal, and what kinds of fears, fantasies, and confessions were involved.  As she points out, any historical explanation should, in part, explain "why the witch hunts were so heavily concentrated in the German speaking lands of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], why so many of the victims were women" (around 80%) with – in Germany - "a shocking preponderance of old women", which given the life expectancy of the time, meant over 40.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

:"Global religious persecutions will not work: in Germany, [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[prince-bishop]]rics were the most fearsome witch-hunters, but in Catholic Italy, Portugal and Spain, the number of deaths were comparatively small. Calvinist Scotland suffered a very serious witch hunt and Lutheran Sweden had a very late outbreak of witch-hunting in which many children were involved."

In this study, Roper suggests various ways of making sense of the historical record, saying that she was surprised because she began the study expecting to look at confessions of sex with the Devil, flying to the Sabbath, or Satanic rituals, and while these facets were there, they did not predominate.
:"What surprised me most when I began to read the detailed trial records of women who were accused of witchcraft was that they talked not about sex and forbidden desire, but about birth, about breastmilk that dried up, about babies who sickened and died, and about the room where the women spent their 'lying in', the period of six weeks after the birth of a child."
In fact, as she discovered "the fears that surrounded witches were not just about the deaths of infants and the early weeks of motherhood, but featured animals and crops, in short, fertility itself". The society in which these people lived was one at subsistence level, with a precarious economy, and years of poor harvests. "Marriage often had to be postponed, and many could never afford to wed. To be a fertile wife with plenty of children was to be honoured and respected.  To be an old woman frequently meant poverty, infirmity, and humiliating dependence on the young." The image of the witch across Europe was remarkably consistent: "she was an old woman, and she attacked young children".

During this period, Europe was recovering from the [[Little Ice Age]], which lasted from the late 16th to the mid 17th century, "a combination of perishingly cold winters and wet summers and autumns which brought bad harvests as the grain rotted".  Everywhere there was "hunger, disease and death".  Apocalyptic visions of a society "under assault from the devil made sense".  The peasants had "fears of sick cows, outbreaks of hail, mysterious insects and various diseases".  To try to stem the problem of a greater population than food supply, it was now that governments enacted regulations forbidding marriages unless couples could support themselves, and introducing legislation to control marriage.

How could the old woman support herself, in a society where women's status was closely tied to their reproductive capacity? Invariable, the old women acted as midwives, helped the mothers with the infants, and could also milk cows; in these capacities, they were placed in the worst possible place when children died, and milk dried up; if men were impotent, it was felt that this came from the baleful presence of the infertile woman.  And fears of fertility also come into the pictures of the time, where a common theme of the fantasy links the post-[[menopause|menopausal]] woman with a young man whom she sexually desires even though she cannot give him children; she concludes that the terror about failure in fertility was one of the forces driving the persecution, which merged with the fantastic confessions (under torture) of Satanic rites.

[[Kathryn Hughes]], reviewing the book, noted that Roper's "particular triumph is to find a way of bridging an anthropological analysis rooted in the kith and kin networks of the 17th century and a psycho-analytical one forged in the bourgeois household of the 19th."

One of the most controversial conclusions of her book, but in agreement with modern historical scholarship, is that most witch prosecutions were not initiated by the Church but by the neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2005/02/01/witch_craze/ "Who Burned the Witches" by Laura Miller, Salon, 1 February 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychohistory===
In her book ''Oedipus and the Devil'' (1994), Roper examines the actions of both accusers and accused during the witch hunts, examining the historical actors through the use of psychological and psychoanalytic examination of their actions, an approach known as [[psychohistory]].&lt;ref&gt;Roper, Lyndal. ''Oedipus and the Devil: Witchcraft, Sexuality and Religion in Early Modern Europe'' (London, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book, Roper asserts that "historical interpretation... nearly always depends at base on the assumption of a measure of resemblance" between ourselves and historical actors and that recognising some enduring universal human qualities of the mind stands to strengthen interpretations of those people's world.&lt;ref&gt;Roper,''Oedipus and the Devil,'' 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
In 2011, Roper was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA).&lt;ref name="bio - British Academy"&gt;{{cite web|title=ROPER, Professor Lyndal|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/ord.cfm?member=6118|website=British Academy Fellows|publisher=British Academy|accessdate=21 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222170130/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/ord.cfm?member=6118|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also an elected [[Fellow of the Royal Historical Society]] (FRHistS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fellows - R|url=http://5hm1h4aktue2uejbs1hsqt31.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RHS-Fellows-R.pdf|website=Royal Historical Society|accessdate=21 December 2015|date=October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222154718/http://5hm1h4aktue2uejbs1hsqt31.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RHS-Fellows-R.pdf|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mdina''' ({{lang-mt|L-Imdina}} {{IPA-mt|lɪmˈdɪnɐ|}}; {{lang-phn|{{Script|Phnx|𐤌𐤋𐤉𐤈𐤄}}}}, {{lang|phn-Latn|Melitta}}, {{lang-grc|Μελίττη}} {{lang|grc-Latn|Melíttē}}, {{lang-ar|مدينة}} {{lang|ar-Latn|[[Medina quarter|Madinah]]}}, {{Lang-it|Medina}}), also known by its titles '''{{lang|it|Città Vecchia}}''' or '''{{lang|it|Città Notabile}}''', is a [[fortifications of Mdina|fortified]] city in the [[Northern Region, Malta|Northern Region]] of [[Malta]], which served as the island's capital from antiquity to the medieval period. The city is still confined within its walls, and has a population of just under 300, but it is contiguous with the town of [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]], which takes its name from the Arabic word for suburb, and has a population of over 11,000 (as of March 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Estimated Population by Locality 31st March, 2014 |url=https://secure2.gov.mt/localgovernment/file.aspx?f=7810 |publisher=[[Government of Malta]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZSEwl5UZ?url=https://secure2.gov.mt/localgovernment/file.aspx?f=7810 |archivedate=21 June 2015 |date=16 May 2014 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was founded as '''Maleth''' in around the 8th century BC by [[Phoenicia]]n settlers, and was later renamed '''[[Melite (ancient city)|Melite]]''' by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Ancient Melite was larger than present-day Mdina, and it was reduced to its present size during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] or Arab occupation of Malta. During the latter period, the city adopted its present name, which derives from the [[Arabic]] word {{lang|ar-Latn|[[medina quarter|medina]]}}. The city remained the capital of Malta throughout the Middle Ages, until the arrival of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]] in 1530, when [[Birgu]] became the administrative centre of the island. Mdina experienced a period of decline over the following centuries, although it saw a revival in the early 18th century. At this point, it acquired several [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] features, although it did not lose its medieval character.

Mdina remained the centre of the Maltese nobility and religious authorities (and property continues to largely be passed down from families and from generation to generation), but it never regained its pre-1530 importance, giving rise to the popular nickname the "Silent City" by both locals and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-1158274/Celebrity-travel-Starry-knights-red-pillar-boxes-pin-plugs-Malta.html |title=Celebrity travel: Starry knights and three-pin plugs in Malta |last=Craven |first=John |date=2 March 2009 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |accessdate=22 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mdina is on the tentative list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s, and it is now one of the main tourist attractions in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blasi |first1=Abigail |title=Top 10 day trips in Malta |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/malta/travel-tips-and-articles/top-10-day-trips-in-malta |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010132218/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/malta/travel-tips-and-articles/top-10-day-trips-in-malta |archivedate=10 October 2015 |date=29 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Antiquity===
{{main|Melite (ancient city)}}

The plateau on which Mdina is built has been inhabited since prehistory, and by the [[Bronze Age]] it was a place of refuge since it was naturally defensible.&lt;ref name="spiteri3–4"&gt;{{harvnb|Spiteri|2004–2007|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Phoenicia]]ns colonized Malta in around the 8th century BC, and they founded the city of Maleth on this plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cassar|2000|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was taken over by the [[Roman Republic]] in 218 BC, becoming known as [[Melite (ancient city)|Melite]]. The Punic-Roman city was about three times the size of present-day Mdina, extending into a large part of modern [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagona|2015|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Early Modern interpretation the [[Acts of the Apostles]], when [[Paul the Apostle]] was shipwrecked on Malta in 60 AD, he was greeted by [[Saint Publius|Publius]], the governor of Melite, and he cured his sick father.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|28:1-10}} According to tradition, the population of Melite converted to Christianity, and Publius became the first [[Bishop of Malta]] and then [[Bishop of Athens]] before being martyred in 112 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin Saints of the Orthodox Patriarchate of Rome|url=http://orthodoxengland.org.uk/stdjan.htm|website=Orthodox England|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326125437/http://www.orthodoxengland.org.uk/stdjan.htm|archivedate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orthodox Malta|url=http://orthodoxengland.org.uk/oemalta.htm|website=Orthodox England|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307112535/http://www.orthodoxengland.org.uk/oemalta.htm|archivedate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Very few remains of the Punic-Roman city survive today. The most significant are the ruins of the [[Domvs Romana]], in which several well-preserved mosaics, statues and other remains were discovered. Remains of the podium of a [[Temple of Apollo (Melite)|Temple of Apollo]], fragments of the city walls and some other sites have also been excavated.&lt;ref name="times2002-03-19"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Testa|first1=Michael|title=New find at Mdina most important so far in old capital|url=http://www.maltamigration.com/news/times93020.shtml|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=19 March 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413115810/http://www.maltamigration.com/news/times93020.shtml|archivedate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===
At some point following the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], a [[Retrenchment (military)|retrenchment]] was built within the city, reducing it to its present size. This was done to make the city's perimeter more easily defensible, and similar reductions in city sizes were common around the Mediterranean region in the early Middle Ages. Although it was traditionally assumed that the retrenchment was built by the Arabs, it has been suggested that it was actually built by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in around the 8th century, when the [[Arab–Byzantine wars|threat from the Arabs]] increased.&lt;ref name="spiteri3–4"/&gt;

In 870, Byzantine Melite, which was ruled by governor Amros (probably Ambrosios), was [[Siege of Melite (870)|besieged]] by [[Aghlabids]] led by Halaf al-Hādim. He was killed in the fighting, and Sawāda Ibn Muḥammad was sent from [[Sicily]] to continue the siege following his death. The duration of the siege is unknown, but it probably lasted for some weeks or months. After Melite fell to the invaders, the inhabitants were massacred, the city was destroyed and its churches were looted. Marble from Melite's churches was used to build the castle of [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brincat|1995|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Al-Himyarī]], Malta remained almost uninhabited until it was resettled in 1048 or 1049 by a Muslim community and their slaves, who built a settlement called Medina on the site of Melite. Archaeological evidence suggests that the city was already a thriving Muslim settlement by the beginning of the 11th century, so 1048–49 might be the date when the city was officially founded and its walls were constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blouet|2007|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout of the new city was completely different to that of ancient Melite.&lt;ref name="times2002-03-19"/&gt; Mdina still has features typical of a [[medina quarter|medina]], a legacy of the period of Arab rule.

The Byzantines [[Siege of Medina (1053–54)|besieged Medina]] in 1053–54, but were repelled by its defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brincat|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city surrendered peacefully to [[Roger I of Sicily]] after a [[Norman invasion of Malta|short siege]] in 1091,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalli|first1=Charles|editor1-last=Cortis|editor1-first=Toni|editor2-last=Gambin|editor2-first=Timothy|title=De Triremibus: Festschrift in honour of Joseph Muscat|date=2005|publisher=Publishers Enterprises Group (PEG) Ltd|isbn=9789990904093|page=273|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/2005%20Dalli.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717075419/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/2005%20Dalli.pdf|archivedate=17 July 2014|chapter=The Siculo-African Peace and Roger I's Annexation of Malta in 1091}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Malta was subsequently incorporated into the [[County of Sicily|County]] and later the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], being dominated by a succession of feudal lords. A castle known as the ''Castellu di la Chitati'' was built on the southeast corner of the city near the main entrance, probably on the site of an earlier Byzantine fort.

The population of Malta during the fifteenth century was about 10,000, with town life limited to Mdina, [[Birgu]] and the [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Gozo Citadel]]. Mdina was comparatively small and partly uninhabited and by 1419, it was already outgrown by its suburb, [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Malta: studies on Malta before the Knights|last=Luttrell|first=Anthony|publisher=The British School at Rome|year=1975|isbn=|location=Rome|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Aragonese rule, local government rested on the ''Università'', a communal body based in Mdina, which collected taxation and administered the islands' limited resources.  At various points during the fifteenth century, this town council complained to its Aragonese overlords that the islands were at the mercy of the sea and the [[saracen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vann|first=Theresa M.|year=2004|title=The Militia of Malta|url=|journal=The Journal of Medieval Military History|volume=2|pages=137–142|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city withstood a [[Siege of Malta (1429)|siege]] by [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid]] invaders in 1429.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20040912/letters/575th-anniversary-of-the-1429-siege-of-malta.112708|title=575th anniversary of the 1429 Siege of Malta|date=12 September 2004|work=[[Times of Malta]]|last1=Cauchi|first1=Mark|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211458/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20040912/letters/575th-anniversary-of-the-1429-siege-of-malta.112708|archivedate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the exact number of casualties or Maltese who were carried into slavery is unknown, the islands suffered depopulation in this raid.

When the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] took over in Malta in 1530, the nobles ceremoniously handed over the keys of the city to Grand Master [[Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam]], but the Order settled in [[Birgu]] and Mdina lost its status as capital city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borg|2002|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1540s, the fortifications began to be upgraded during the magistracy of [[Juan de Homedes y Coscon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spiteri|2004–2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1551 the city withstood a [[Invasion of Gozo (1551)#Malta|brief Ottoman attack]].&lt;ref name="independent2015-06-15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grima|first1=Noel|title=The Mdina siege of 1429 was 'greater than the Great Siege' of 1565|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-06-15/local-news/The-Mdina-siege-of-1429-was-greater-than-the-Great-Siege-6736137257|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=15 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815144304/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-06-15/local-news/The-Mdina-siege-of-1429-was-greater-than-the-Great-Siege-6736137257|archivedate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Siege of Malta]] in 1565, Mdina was the base of the Order's cavalry, which made occasional sorties on the invading Ottomans. On 7 August 1565, the cavalry attacked the unprotected Ottoman field hospital, which led in the invaders abandoning a major assault on the main fortifications in Birgu and [[Senglea]]. The Ottomans attempted to take Mdina in September so as to winter there, but abandoned their plans when the city fired its cannon, leading them to believe that it had ammunition to spare. After the siege, Maltese military engineer [[Girolamo Cassar]] drew up plans to reduce Mdina's size by half and turning it into a fortress, but these were never implemented due to protests by the city's nobles.&lt;ref name="independent2015-06-15"/&gt; The fortifications were again upgraded in the mid-17th century, when the large De Redin Bastion was built at the centre of the land front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De Redin Bastion – Mdina|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1445.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|accessdate=13 July 2015|date=28 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714011656/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1445.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mdina suffered severe damage during the [[1693 Sicily earthquake]], although no casualties were reported. The 13th-century [[St. Paul's Cathedral, Mdina|Cathedral of St. Paul]] was partially destroyed, and it was rebuilt by [[Lorenzo Gafà]] in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]] between 1697 and 1703.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montanaro Gauci|first1=Gerald|title=Mdina cathedral destroyed in the 1693 earthquake|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150111/life-features/Mdina-cathedral-destroyed-in-the-1693-earthquake.551625|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=11 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213154924/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150111/life-features/Mdina-cathedral-destroyed-in-the-1693-earthquake.551625|archivedate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 1722, newly elected Grand Master [[António Manoel de Vilhena]] issued orders for the restoration and renovation of Mdina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Lucca|first1=Denis|title=Mdina: Baroque town planning in 18th century Mdina|journal=Heritage: An encyclopedia of Maltese culture and civilization|date=1979|volume=1|pages=21–25|publisher=Midsea Books Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This renovation was entrusted to the French architect and military engineer [[Charles François de Mondion]], who introduced strong [[French Baroque architecture|French Baroque]] elements into what was still a largely medieval city. At this point, large parts of the fortifications and the city entrance were completely rebuilt. The remains of the ''Castellu di la Chitati'' were demolished to make way for [[Palazzo Vilhena]], while the main gate was walled up and a new [[Mdina Gate]] was built nearby. Several public buildings were also built, including the [[Banca Giuratale (Mdina)|Banca Giuratale]] and the [[Corte Capitanale]]. The last major addition to the Mdina fortifications was Despuig Bastion, which was completed in 1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Despuig Bastion – Mdina|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1448.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|date=28 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713220736/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/Knights%20Fortifications/1448.pdf|archivedate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French occupation and British rule===
[[File:French Mdina plaque.jpeg|thumb|Plaque near the [[Torre dello Standardo]] commemorating six Maltese people who were killed during the uprising of September 1798]]

On 10 June 1798, Mdina was captured by French forces without much resistance during the [[French invasion of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castillo|2006|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French garrison remained in the city, but a Maltese uprising broke out on 2 September of that year. The following day, rebels entered the city through a sally port and massacred the garrison of 65 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|2002|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events marked the beginning of [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|a two-year uprising and blockade]], and the Maltese set up a National Assembly which met at Mdina's Banca Giuratale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malta under the French: The Blockade|url=http://www.kagoon.com/3-blockadenotes-pdf-1/main|website=kagoon.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027170439/http://www.kagoon.com/3-blockadenotes-pdf-1/main|archivedate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels were successful, and in 1800 the French surrendered and Malta became a [[Malta Protectorate|British protectorate]].&lt;ref name="independent2015-06-15"/&gt;

From 1883 to 1931, Mdina was linked with [[Valletta]] by the [[Malta Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Route|url=http://maltarailway.com/route/route.html|website=maltarailway.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313145104/http://maltarailway.com/route/route.html|archivedate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day===
Today, Mdina is one of Malta's major tourist attractions, hosting about 750,000 tourists a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zammit|first1=Ninu|title=Restoration of forts and fortifications|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20061212/opinion/restoration-of-forts-and-fortifications.32474|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=12 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235408/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20061212/opinion/restoration-of-forts-and-fortifications.32474|archivedate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[Automobile|cars]] (other than a limited number of residents, emergency vehicles, wedding cars and horses) are allowed in Mdina, partly why it has earned the nickname 'the Silent City'. The city displays an unusual mix of [[Norman architecture|Norman]] and [[Baroque]] [[architecture]], including several palaces, most of which serve as private homes.

An extensive restoration of the city walls was undertaken between 2008 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mdina bastions restoration works completed|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/63774/mdina_bastions_restoration_works_completed|work=[[Malta Today]]|date=5 April 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424103722/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/63774/mdina_bastions_restoration_works_completed|archivedate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

===Childhood and schooling===

At the age of ten, Omolewa's [[Religious belief|believing]] father: Daniel Omilusi, a [[Tribal chief|Senior Chief]] of the Ipoti-Ekiti region of Nigeria, granted some [[Missionary|missionaries]]; including David Babcock – first [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Adventist]] missionary to West Africa, permission to spiritually and educationally mentor young Michael, who was born as 11th child in Omilusi's large family; and was brought up with the prestige that Africa gives the son of a village chief or leader.

'''''Multitudes''''' is a French [[philosophy|philosophical]], political and artistic monthly journal founded in 2000 by [[Yann Moulier-Boutang]]. It is thematically situated in the theoretical framework of the [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] work [[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|''Empire'']] by [[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]]. The journal, like the book, focuses on the further elaboration of the philosophical and political thought of the Italian ''[[Autonomist Marxism|operaismo]]'', but seems also to rest on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Althusser]], and [[Deleuze]]'s thought. It is a successor to the review [[Futur Antérieur]] edited by  Jean-Marie Vincent (1934-2004) and Toni Negri, at the dep. of political science - University Vincennes Paris 8. It is a member of the [[Eurozine]] network.

''Multitudes's'' name comes from the [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinozist]] [[multitude|eponymic concept]]. It has been thought by Toni Negri as an alternative to the classic conception of the [[people]], [[class consciousness]], or [[nation-state]]. It publishes a lot on themes relating to the [[information society]] and the [[knowledge economy]], supporting in particular the thesis of a "cognitive labour" and "[[affective labor|affective labour]]" which can not be measured by standard means of labor-time, and also insists on the cooperative aspects of production in modern society. For this reason and others, it tends to argue in favour of a [[guaranteed minimum income]].

Contents published by ''Multitudes'' are mostly in French, although some articles are translated (in English, Spanish, etc.) and are under a [[Creative Commons]] license.

The '''Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino''' (English: ''Chilean Museum of Pre-Columbian Art'') is an [[art museum]] dedicated to the study and display of [[pre-Columbian art]]works and [[artefact (archaeology)|artifact]]s from [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref name="BensonGraham2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Benson|author2=Melissa Graham|title=The Rough Guide to Chile|date=3 August 2009|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4053-8381-3|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is located in the city centre of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], the capital of [[Chile]]. The museum was founded by the Chilean architect and antiquities collector [[Sergio Larraín García-Moreno]], who had sought premises for the display and preservation of his private collection of pre-Columbian artefacts acquired over the course of nearly fifty years. With the support of Santiago's [[municipalidad|municipal government]] at the time, García-Moreno secured the building and established the museum's [[curator]]ial institution. The museum first opened in December 1981 and was closed from 2011 to 2013 for renovation.&lt;ref name="TER"&gt;{{cite news|title=Museo de Arte Precolombino reabrirá sus puertas en noviembre| url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/santiago/2013/08/1731-535737-9-museo-de-arte-precolombino-reabrira-sus-puertas-en-noviembre.shtml| language=Spanish|newspaper=[[La Tercera]]|date=1 August 2013|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original collection was acquired based on the aesthetic quality of the objects, instead of their scientific or historical context. The collection is broken up into four areas:&lt;ref name="BensonGraham2009"/&gt;
;Area mesoamerica: Includes a statue of [[Xipe Totec]], an [[incense burner]] from the [[Teotihucan]] culture, and a [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] [[bas-relief]].&lt;ref name="BensonGraham2009"/&gt;
;Area Intermedia: Showcase pieces include pottery from the [[Valdivia culture|Valdivia people]], and [[Capulí culture|Capuli]] figures chewing [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa leaf]]. Gold objects from the [[Veraguas]] and [[Diquis culture|Diquis]] cultures are also represented.&lt;ref name="BensonGraham2009"/&gt;
;Area Andes Centrales: Features masks and copper figures, of which many were confiscated from graves. Examples include those from the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] and textiles. The oldest textile in the museum is in this area, a painted cloth almost 3,000 years old from the [[Chavín culture]].&lt;ref name="BensonGraham2009"/&gt;
;Area Andes del Sur: This collection features modern Chilean and Argentinian pieces. Ceramic urns from the [[Aguada culture]], [[snuff tray]]s from the [[San Pedro culture]], and an [[Incan]] [[quipu]].&lt;ref name="BensonGraham2009"/&gt;

He is [[Emeritus Professor]] at the [[Department of History and Philosophy of Science, Cambridge|Department of History and Philosophy of Science]] (HPS) at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/people/jardine/ HPS Cambridge: Teaching Officers Nick Jardine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Jardine was educated at [[Monkton Combe School]] in Somerset and read natural sciences at [[King's College, Cambridge]].  He then worked as a King's College and Royal Society Research Fellow on the automation of classification and information retrieval and its applications to biological taxonomy and diagnosis.  In 1975 he moved to [[Darwin College, Cambridge]] and to the Department of History and Philosophy of Science.  Since then he has developed a question-based pragmatic philosophy of science (inspired by the work of [[Ian Hacking]]), as well as studying the history of early-modern astronomy and natural history, and reflecting on the methodology of the history of the sciences.  From 1987–2011 he was Senior Editor of Studies in History and Philosophy of Science and from 1998 of Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences.   Since his retirement in 2010 he has been Senior Consultant to the Cambridge Scientific Heritage Project (2010–13) and principal investigator of the project Diagrams, Figures and the Transformation of Astronomy, 1450–1650 (2008–14) http://www.astronomicalimages.group.cam.ac.uk

==Hobbies==
Jardine was a founding member in 1988 of the popular research seminar "The Cabinet of Natural History (Cambridge Group for the History of Natural History and the Environmental Sciences)".  This is organised by staff and students of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, and in term time it holds weekly seminars led by academic speakers. Jardine is a keen amateur mycologist and for over twenty years has led the annual HPS [[fungus]] hunt.&lt;ref&gt;HPS Cambridge: Fungus Hunt 2009 [http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/oldnews/fungushunt2009/] Retrieved 28 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18134">The [[liturgy|liturgical]] [[vestment]]s of the [[Christian church]]es grew out of normal civil clothing, but the dress of church leaders began to be differentiated as early as the 4th century. By the end of the 13th century the forms used in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches had become established, while the [[Reformation]] led to changes in [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches from the 16th century onward.

==Secular origins==
The vestments of the Catholic Church, East and West, developed out of the various articles of everyday dress worn by citizens of the [[Greco-Roman world]] under the [[Roman Empire]]. The officers of the Church during the first few centuries of its existence were content to officiate in the dress of civil life, though their garments were expected to be scrupulously clean and of decent quality. The few scattered references in contemporary records to the dress of the clergy all point to this as the only recognized rule. Thus in the 37th of the 4th-century ''[[Canons of Hippolytus]]'' we read: "As often as the [[bishop]]s would partake of the Mysteries, the [[presbyter]]s and [[deacon]]s shall gather round him clad in white, quite particularly clean clothes, more beautiful than those of the rest of the people." Thus, too, [[Jerome|St Jerome]], in his commentary on [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] xliv. 19, wrote that "We, too, ought not to enter the [[Holy of Holies#Christianity|Holy of Holies]] in our everyday garments ... when they have become defiled from the use of ordinary life, but with a clean conscience, and in clean garments, hold in our hands the Sacrament of the Lord."{{sfn|Phillips|1911|pp=1056-1057}}

When, in the year 289, St [[Cyprian]] was led to [[martyr]]dom, he wore, according to [[Eusebius]],&lt;ref&gt;''Hist. eccles.'' iv. cap. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; an under [[tunic]] (''linea''), an upper tunic (''[[dalmatic]]a'', ''tunica'') and [[mantle (monastic vesture)|mantle]] (''lacerna'', ''byrrus''). This was the ordinary type of the civil costume of the time. The tunica, a loose sack-like tunic with a hole for the head, was the innermost garment worn by all classes of Roman citizens under the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. It was either sleeveless (''colobium'') or sleeved (''tunica manicata'' or ''manuleata''), and originally fell about to the knee, but later on reached to the ankles (''tunica talaris''). [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]] said that to wear ''talares et tunicas manicatas'' was a disgrace among the ancient Romans, but that in his own day it was no longer so considered in the case of persons of good birth.&lt;ref&gt;''De doctr. christ.'' iii. cap. 10, n. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The tunica was originally of white [[wool]], but in the 3rd century it began to be made of [[linen]], and from the 4th century was always of linen.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1057}}

About the 6th century the long ''tunica alba'' went out of fashion in civil life, but it was retained in the services of the Church and developed into the various forms of the liturgical [[alb]] and [[surplice]]. The ''tunica dalmatica'' was a long, sleeved upper tunic, originating, as its name implies, in [[Dalmatia]], and first becoming fashionable in [[Rome]] during the 2nd century; it is the origin of the liturgical [[dalmatic]] and [[tunicle]]. Another over-dress of the Romans was the ''paenula'', a cloak akin to the current Spanish ''[[poncho]]'', a large piece of material with a hole for the head to go through, hanging in ample folds round the body. This was originally worn only by [[slavery|slaves]], [[soldier]]s and other people of low degree; in the 3rd century, however, it was adopted by fashionable people as a convenient riding or travelling cloak and finally, by the [[sumptuary law]] of 382 it was prescribed as the proper everyday dress of senators,&lt;ref&gt;''Cod. Theod.'' xiv. 10, 1, ''de habitu ... intra urbem''.&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the military ''[[chlamys]]'', the [[toga]] being reserved for state occasions. This was the origin of the principal liturgical vestment, the [[chasuble]].{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1057}}

==Establishment of form==
[[Image:Pope Honorius I - Apse mosaic - Sant'Agnese fuori le mura - Rome 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Pope Honorius I (died 638). From a mosaic in [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura|Sant'Agnese]] in Rome]]
As late as the 6th century the garments described above were common both to the clergy and [[laity]], and, so far as their character was concerned, were used both in the liturgy and in everyday life. Meanwhile, however, a certain development had taken place. By the 4th century the garments worn at liturgical functions had been separated from those in ordinary use, though still identical in form. It is in the 4th century, too, that the first distinctive vestment makes its appearance, the {{lang|grc|ὠμοφόριον}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Ōmophórion}}'') worn by all bishops in the East; in the 5th century we find this in use at Rome under the name of ''[[pallium]]'', as the distinctive ornament of the [[pope]] (see the mosaic image of [[Honorius I]]). About the same time the ''orarium'', or [[stole (vestment)|stole]], becomes fixed in liturgical use. The main development and definition of the ecclesiastical vestments, however, took place between the 6th and the 9th centuries. The secular fashions altered with changes of taste, but the Church retained the dress with the other traditions of the Roman Empire. At Rome, especially, where the popes had succeeded to a share of the power and pretensions of the [[Caesar (title)|caesars]] of the West, the accumulation of ecclesiastical vestments symbolized a very special dignity: in the second quarter of the 9th century the pope, when fully vested, wore a ''camisia'' ([[chemise]]) girdled, an alb (''linea'') girdled, an [[amice]] (''anagolaium''), a tunicle (''dalmatica minor''), a dalmatic (''dalmatica major''), stole (''orarium''), chasuble (''planeta'') and pallium. With the exception of the pallium, this was also the costume of the Roman deacons. By this time, moreover, the liturgical character of the vestments was so completely established that they were no longer worn instead of, but over, the ordinary dress.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1057}}

Hitherto the example of the Roman Church had exercised no exclusive determining influence on ritual development even in the West. The popes had, from time to time, sent the pallium or the dalmatic{{mdash}}specifically Roman vestments{{mdash}}as gifts of honour to various distinguished [[prelate]]s. [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]], converted by a Roman mission, had adopted the Roman use, and English missionaries had carried this into the newly Christianized parts of Germany, but the great Churches of [[Spain]] and [[Gaul]] preserved their own traditions in vestments as in other matters. From the 9th century onwards, however, this was changed, and everywhere in the West the Roman use ousted the regional uses.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1057}}

This change synchronized with the revival of the Western Empire under [[Charlemagne]], a revival which necessarily gave an impulse to the claims of the [[Holy See]]. The adoption of the Roman liturgical dress had, however, at most an indirect connection with these claims. Charlemagne was active in prescribing the adoption of the Roman use; but this was only as part of his general policy in the organization of his empire. A renovation of the Galilean Church was not the least crying need; and, in view of the confusion of rites (Gallican, Gothic, Roman, Ambrosian) in the Frankish empire, Charlemagne recognized that this innovation could only be effectually carried out by a closer connection with Rome in ritual as in other matters. Charlemagne's activity in this respect was, in effect, only the completion of a process that had been going on since the 6th century.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1057}}

Whatever effect the reinvigoration of the papacy may have had in hastening the process, the original impulse towards the adoption of the Roman rite had proceeded, not from Rome, but from Spain and Gaul. It was the natural result of the lively interchange between the Churches of these countries and the Holy See. Nor was the process of assimilation by any means one-sided. If Spain and Gaul borrowed from Rome, they also exercised a reciprocal influence on the Roman use. A large proportion of the names of the liturgical vestments are not of Roman origin, and the non-Roman names tended to supersede the Roman in Rome itself.{{efn|Apart from the archiepiscopal pallium, the Churches of Spain and Gaul had need to borrow from Rome only the dalmatic, maniple, and liturgical shoes. On the other hand, it was from Spain and Gaul that Rome probably received the ''orarium'' as an ensign of the major orders.}}{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1057}}

==Pre-Reformation development==
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene31 detail Stigand.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Stigand]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] (1052–1070), from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. Note the absence of the mitre, the chasuble short or tucked up in front, the maniple still carried in the left hand.]]
The period between the 9th and the 13th centuries is that of the final development of the liturgical vestments in the West. In the 9th century appeared the [[Episcopal gloves|Pontifical gloves]]; in the 10th, the [[mitre]]; in the 11th, the use of liturgical shoes and [[Episcopal sandals#Liturgical stockings|stockings]] was reserved for [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]] and bishops. By the 12th century, mitre and gloves were worn by all bishops, and in many cases they had assumed a new ornament, the ''[[rationale (clothing)|rationale]]'', a merely honorific decoration (supposed to symbolize doctrine and wisdom), sometimes of the nature of a highly ornamental broad shoulder collar with dependent [[lappet]]s, and sometimes closely resembling the pallium; rarely a "breast-plate" on the model of that of the Jewish high priest.{{efn|Use of the ''rationale'' largely died out during the 13th century.}}  This elaboration of the pontifical vestments was contemporaneous with, and doubtless partly determined by, the assimilation of the bishops during those centuries to the type of the great feudal nobles whose ambitions and love of pomp they shared.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1058}}

With the evolution of the [[Feudalism|feudal]] organization of society, even everyday costume was becoming a uniform, symbolizing in material and colour the exact status of the wearer. It was natural that in the parallel organization of the Church the official vestments should undergo a similar process of differentiation and definition. With this process, which in all its essential features was completed in the 11th century, [[doctrine|doctrinal]] developments had little or nothing to do, though from the 9th century onwards liturgiologists were busy expounding the mystic symbolism of garments which, until their imagination set to work, had for the most part no symbolism whatever. Yet in view of later controversies, the changes made during this period, notably in the vestments connected with the mass, are not without significance. Hitherto the chasuble had been worn by all ministers at the [[Eucharist]], even by the [[acolyte]]s; it had been worn also at processions and other non-liturgical functions. It was now exalted into the mass vestment ''par excellence'', worn by the celebrant only, or by his immediate assistants (deacon and [[subdeacon]]) only on very special occasions. New vestments were devised to take the place, on less solemn occasions, of those hallowed by association with the holy sacrifice; thus the processional [[cope]] appeared in the 11th century and the surplice in the 12th. A change, too, came over the general character of vestments. Up to the 9th century these had been very plain, without ornament save such traditional decorations as the ''clavi'' of the dalmatic; what splendour they had was due to their material and the ample folds of their draperies. But from this time onwards they tend to become more and more elaborately decorated with [[embroidery]] and [[Jewellery|jeweller's]] work.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1058}}

Very significant, too, is the parting of the ways in the development of liturgical vestments in the East and West. During the first centuries both branches of the Church had used vestments substantially the same, developed from common originals; the alb, chasuble, stole and pallium were the equivalents of the {{lang|grc|στιχάριον}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[sticharion]]}}''), {{lang|grc|φενλόνιον}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[phelonion]]}}''), {{lang|grc|ὠράριον}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[orarion|ōrarion]]}}'') and {{lang|grc|ὠμοφόριον}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[omophorion|ōmophorion]]}}''). While, however, between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Western Church was adding largely to her store of vestments, that of the East increased her list by but three, the {{lang|grc|ἐνχείριον}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|enchirion}}'') and {{lang|grc|ἐπιμανίκια}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[epimanikia]]}}'') and the {{lang|grc|σάκκος}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[sakkos]]}}''). The living force of development in the Latin Church was symbolized in her garments; the orthodoxy of the Greek Church in hers. With the exception of the mitre, introduced in the 15th or 16th century, the liturgical costume of the Eastern clergy remains now practically what it was in the 9th century.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1058}}

In the Western Church, though from the 9th century onwards the Roman use had been the norm, considerable alterations continued to be made in the shape and decoration of the liturgical vestments, and in this respect various Churches developed different traditions, as in the chasuble. The definition of their use by the various orders of the clergy in the several liturgical functions, however, was established by the close of the 13th century.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1058}} The images below illustrate changes up to that time. For centuries thereafter the dress has been essentially unaltered.

In [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Churches{{efn|Broadly defined as those churches that reformed their doctrine as a result of the Protestant Reformation.}} the custom as to vestments differs widely, corresponding to a similar divergence in tradition and teaching. At the [[Reformation]] two tendencies became apparent. [[Martin Luther]] and his followers regarded vestments as among the ''[[adiaphora#Christianity|adiaphora]]'', and in the Churches which afterwards came to be known as "Lutheran" many of the traditional Catholic vestments were retained. [[John Calvin]], on the other hand, laid stress on the principle of the utmost simplicity in public worship; at the councils in [[History of Geneva#Reformation|Geneva]], the traditional vestments were absolutely abolished, and the Genevan model was followed by the [[Calvinist]] or "Reformed" Churches throughout Europe.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1060}}

[[File:Anglican priest vested in an alb, cincture and purple stole.jpg|thumb|An Anglican priest wearing a white cincture around his waist to hold his alb and purple stole in place.]]
The [[Church of England]], in which the Lutheran and Calvinistic points of view struggled for the mastery, experienced a long [[Vestments controversy|controversy]] over the proper use of vestments.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1060}} In the 20th and 21st century, usual vestments for the Anglican church include the alb with a [[cincture]], and stole, over a [[cassock]] (a derivative of the tunic). 

Eventually the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Churches of [[Denmark]] and [[Scandinavia]] retained the use of alb and chasuble in the celebration of the Eucharist (stole, amice, girdle and maniple were not used after the Reformation), and for bishops the cope and mitre. The surplice is not used, the ministers conducting the ordinary services and preaching in a black gown, of the 16th-century type, with white [[Bands (neckwear)|preaching bands]] or [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]]. In Germany the [[pietism|Evangelical Church]] (itself an outcome of a compromise between Lutherans and Reformed), in general, discarded the old vestments. In Prussia the superintendents now started to wear [[pectoral cross]]es, which were instituted by the emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]. In the Calvinistic "Reformed" Churches the minister wore the black [[Geneva gown]] with bands. This use was largely discontinued in the [[Free church]]es. On the other hand, some of these again adopted the surplice, and in one at least (the [[Catholic Apostolic Church]]) the traditional Catholic vestments were largely revived.{{sfn|Phillips|1911|p=1060}}

'''Pohelā''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: पोहेला) is the third month in the [[Nepal Era]] calendar, the national [[lunar calendar]] of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Sambat gets national status|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5|accessdate=8 May 2014|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=24 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020104054/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The month corresponds to [[Pausha]] (पौष) in the [[Hindu lunar calendar]] and roughly matches [[January]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

Pohelā begins with the [[new moon]] and the [[full moon]] falls on the 15th of the [[lunar month]]. The month is divided into the bright and dark fortnights which are known as Pohelā Thwa (पोहेला थ्व) and Pohelā Gā (पोहेला गा) respectively.

The sacred bathing festival of [[Seto Machindranath|White Machindranath]], the [[Bodhisattva]] of Compassion, is held on the 8th day of the bright fortnight at the courtyard of Jana Baha in [[Kathmandu]]. On the full moon day known as Paush Purnimā, which is celebrated as Milā Punhi (मिला पुन्हि) in [[Nepal Mandala]], the procession of the deity [[Changu Narayan]] is held in Kathmandu.

The month-long [[Swasthani]] sacred story reciting festival also starts on the full moon day. In [[Sankhu]], a town 16&amp;nbsp;km to the east of Kathmandu, devotees fast and take daily holy dips in the Sali Nadi River throughout the month to mark the Swasthani festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Month-long 'Swasthani Brata Katha' starts |url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2014/01/16/top-story/month-long-swasthani-brata-katha-starts/384008.html|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another event, unusable clay pots are collected at market squares and broken into pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levy |first= Robert Isaac |date=1990 |title= Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal|chapter=A Catalogue of Annual Events and Their Distribution throughout the Lunar Year |publisher= University of California Press |page=645 |isbn=9780520069114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian capital was often pictured by symbolists as a depressing, nightmarish city.]]
'''Russian symbolism''' was an intellectual and [[artistic movement]] predominant at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. It represented the Russian branch of the [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist movement]] in European art, and was mostly known for its contributions to Russian poetry.

==Literature==
Primary influences on the movement were the [[irrationalism|irrationalistic]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] poetry and philosophy of [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] and [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novels, the operas of [[Richard Wagner]], the philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], French [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] and [[Decadence|decadent]] poets (such as [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]]), and the dramas of [[Henrik Ibsen]].

The movement was inaugurated by [[Nikolai Minsky]]'s article "The Ancient Debate" (1884) and [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]]'s book ''On the Causes of the Decline and on the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature'' (1892). Both writers promoted extreme [[individualism]] and deified the act of creation. [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky|Merezhkovsky]] was known for his poetry as well as a series of novels on ''god-men'', among whom he counted [[Jesus]], [[Joan of Arc]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Napoleon]] and (later) [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. His wife, [[Zinaida Gippius]], also a major poet in the early days of the symbolist movement, opened a salon in [[Saint Petersburg]], which came to be known as the "headquarters of Russian [[decadence]]".

===Rise of symbolism===
[[File:Mikhail Nesterov 001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Mikhail Nesterov]]'s painting ''[[The Vision of the Youth Bartholomew]]'' (1890) is often considered to mark the inauguration of the Russian Symbolist movement.]]
By the mid-1890s, Russian symbolism was still mainly a set of theories and had few notable practitioners. [[Aleksandr Dobrolyubov (writer)|Alexander Dobrolyubov]] published a book of verse in 1895, just before renouncing lay poetry in favour of wanderings from one monastery to another. Another talented author, [[Ivan Konevskoy]], died at the age of 24. It was not until the new talent of [[Valery Bryusov]] emerged that symbolist poetry became a major movement in Russian literature. In order to represent symbolism as a movement of formidable following, Bryusov adopted numerous pen-names and published three volumes of his own verse, entitled ''Russian Symbolists. An Anthology'' (1894–95). Bryusov's mystification proved successful — several young poets were attracted to symbolism as the latest fashion in Russian letters. In addition to Bryusov, the most popular poets were [[Konstantin Balmont]], who believed in first inspiration and sometimes intentionally left his verse unrevised, and the pessimistic [[Fyodor Sologub]], who referred to himself as the ''bard of death''.

Though the reputations of many of these writers had faded by the mid-20th century, the influence of the symbolist movement was nonetheless profound. This was especially true in the case of [[Innokenty Annensky]], whose definitive collection of verse, ''Cypress Box'', was published posthumously (1909). Sometimes cited as a Slavic counterpart to the [[Poète maudit|accursed poets]], Annensky managed to render into Russian the essential intonations of [[Baudelaire]] and [[Verlaine]], while the subtle music, ominous allusions, arcane vocabulary, and the spell of minutely changing colours and odours in his poetry were all his own. His influence on the [[Acmeist poetry|acmeist]] school of Russian poetry ([[Anna Akhmatova|Akhmatova]], [[Nikolay Gumilyov|Gumilyov]], [[Osip Mandelshtam|Mandelshtam]]) was paramount.

===Second generation===
[[File:meyerhold1906.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] in his production of [[Alexander Blok]]'s ''Puppet Show'' (1906)]]
Russian symbolism really flourished in the first decade of the 20th century. Many new talents began to publish verse written in the symbolist vein. These writers were especially indebted to the philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]]. The scholar [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], whose interests lay in ancient poetry, returned from Italy to establish a ''[[Dionysus|Dionysian]]'' club in St Petersburg. His self-proclaimed principle was to engraft "archaic [[John Milton|Miltonic]] diction" to Russian poetry. [[Maximilian Voloshin]], known best for his poetry about the Russian revolution, opened a poetic salon at his villa in the [[Crimea]]. [[Jurgis Baltrušaitis]], a close friend of [[Alexander Scriabin]] and whose poetry is characterized by mystical philosophy and mesmerizing sounds, was active in Lithuania.

Of the new generation, two young poets, Alexander Blok and Andrei Bely, became the most renowned of the entire Russian symbolist movement. [[Alexander Blok]] is widely considered to be one of the leading Russian poets of the twentieth century. He was often compared with Alexander Pushkin, and the whole [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]] was sometimes styled the "Age of Blok." His early verse is impeccably musical and rich in sound. Later, he sought to introduce daring rhythmic patterns and uneven beats into his poetry. His mature poems are often based on the conflict between the Platonic vision of ideal beauty and the disappointing reality of foul industrial outskirts. They are often characterized by an idiosyncratic use of color and spelling to express meaning.  One of Blok's most famous and controversial poems was "The Twelve," which described the march of twelve Bolshevik soldiers through the streets of revolutionary [[Petrograd]] in pseudo-religious terms.

[[Andrei Bely]] strove to forge a unity of prose, poetry, and music in much of his literature, as evidenced by the title of one of his early works, ''Symphonies in Prose''. However, his fame rests primarily on post-symbolist works such as celebrated [[modernist]] novel ''[[Petersburg (novel)|Petersburg]] ''(1911-1913), a philosophical and spiritual work featuring a highly unorthodox narrative style, fleeting allusions and distinctive rhythmic experimentation.  [[Vladimir Nabokov]] placed it second in his list of the greatest novels of the twentieth century after [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.  Other works worthy of mention include the highly influential theoretical book of essays ''Symbolism'' (1910), which was instrumental in redefining the goals of the symbolist movement, and the novel ''Kotik Letaev'' (1914-1916), which traces the first glimpses of consciousness in a new-born baby.

The city of [[St. Petersburg]] itself became one of the major symbols utilized by the second generation of Russian symbolists. Blok's verses on the imperial capital bring to life an [[impressionism|impressionistic picture]] of the "city of a thousand illusions"{{Cite quote|date=September 2009}} and as a doomed world full of merchants and [[bourgeois]] figures. Various elemental forces (such as sunrises and sunsets, light and darkness, lightning and fire) assume apocalyptic qualities, serving as portents of a cataclysmic event that would change the earth and humanity forever. The [[Scythians]] and [[Mongols]] were often found in the works of these poets, serving as symbols of future catastrophic wars. Due to the [[eschatology|eschatological]] tendency inherent in the Russian symbolist movement, many of them—including Blok, Bely, and Bryusov—accepted the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] as the next evolutionary step in their nation's history.

===Other Russian symbolist prose===
[[File:Kandreiter.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s emblem of the symbolic [[Der Blaue Reiter|Blue Rider]] (1911)]]
[[Fyodor Sologub]] was the first writer to introduce the morbid, pessimistic elements characteristic of ''[[fin de siècle]]'' literature and philosophy into Russian prose. His most famous novel, ''The Petty Demon'' (1902), was an attempt to create a living portrait of the concept known in Russian as ''[[poshlost']]'' (an idea whose meaning lies somewhere between evil, trashy and banality or [[kitsch]]). His next large prose work, ''A Created Legend'' (a trilogy consisting of ''Drops of Blood,'' ''Queen Ortruda,'' and ''Smoke and Ash''), contained many of the same characteristics but presented a considerably more positive and hopeful view of the world.

[[Valery Bryusov]]'s novel ''[[The Fiery Angel (novel)|The Fiery Angel]]'' is also well known. It tells the story of a 16th-century German scholar and his attempts to win the love of a young woman whose spiritual integrity is seriously undermined by her participation in occult practices and her dealings with unclean forces. The novel served as the basis for [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]''.

One Russian symbolist who wrote mainly prose was [[Alexei Remizov]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Julia Friedman]], ''Beyond Symbolism and Surrealism: Alexei Remizov's Synthetic Art'', Northwestern University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on medieval Russian literature, he grotesquely combined dreams, reality and pure whimsy in his works.

===Decline of the movement===
Russian symbolism had begun to lose its momentum in literature by the 1920s. Its major practitioners{{Who|date=September 2009}} frequently conflicted in the pages of the journals ''[[Vesy]]'', ''Zolotoe runo'' and ''Pereval''. Others{{Who|date=September 2009}} wrestled for control of key printing houses. Meanwhile, many younger poets were drawn to the [[Acmeism|acmeist]] movement, which distanced itself from excesses of symbolism. Still others{{Who|date=September 2009}} joined the ranks of the [[Russian Futurism|futurists]], an iconoclastic group which sought to recreate art entirely, eschewing all aesthetic conventions.

Despite intense disapproval by the Soviet State, however, Symbolism continued to be an influence on poets like [[Boris Pasternak]]. In the ''Literary Gazette'' of September 9, 1958, the critic Viktor Pertsov denounced, "the decadent religious poetry of Pasternak, which reeks of mothballs from the Symbolist suitcase of 1908-10 manufacture."&lt;ref&gt;[[Olga Ivinskaya]] (1978), ''A Captive of Time: My Years with Pasternak'', page 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==
[[File:Vrubel Demon.jpg|280px|thumb|''[[The Demon Seated]]'' by [[Mikhail Vrubel]] (1890)]]
Probably the most important Russian symbolist painter was [[Mikhail Vrubel]], who achieved fame with a large [[mosaic]]-like canvas ''[[The Demon Seated]]'' (1890) and went mad while working on the dynamic and sinister ''Demon Downcast'' (1902).

Other symbolist painters associated with the ''[[Mir iskusstva|World of Art]]'' magazine were [[Victor Borisov-Musatov]] and [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], followers of [[Puvis de Chavannes]]; [[Mikhail Nesterov]], who painted religious subjects from medieval Russian history; [[Mstislav Dobuzhinsky]], with his "urbanistic phantasms", and [[Nicholas Roerich]], whose paintings have been described as hermetic, or esoteric. The tradition of Russian symbolism in the late Soviet period was renewed by [[Konstantin Vasilyev]], whose style was greatly influenced by the Russian Neo-romantic painter [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], as well as [[Mikhail Nesterov]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]].

==Music and theatre==
[[File:Petrutxca de Fokine-1911.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Alexandre Benois]] designed symbolist sets for [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' in 1911.]]
The foremost symbolist composer was [[Alexander Scriabin]] who in his [[Symphony No. 1 (Scriabin)|''First Symphony'']] praised art as a kind of religion. [[Symphony No. 3 (Scriabin)|''Le Divin Poème'']] (1902-1904) sought to express "the evolution of the human spirit from [[pantheism]] to unity with the universe."{{Cite quote|date=September 2009}} [[Prometheus: The Poem of Fire|''Prométhée'']] (1910), given in 1915 in [[New York City]], was accompanied by elaborately selected colour projections on a screen.

In Scriabin's synthetic performances music, poetry, dancing, colours, and scents were used so as to bring about "supreme, final ecstasy."{{Cite quote|date=September 2009}} [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]] articulated similar ideas on the "stage fusion of all arts."{{Cite quote|date=September 2009}}

As to more traditional theatre, [[Paul Schmidt (translator)|Paul Schmidt]] an influential translator, has written that ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' and some other late plays of [[Anton Chekhov]] show the influence of the Symbolist movement.&lt;ref&gt;''The Plays of Anton Chekhov'', trans. Paul Schmidt (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Their first production by [[Constantin Stanislavski]] was as realistic as possible. Stanislavski collaborated with the English [[theatre practitioner]] [[Edward Gordon Craig]] on a significant [[Moscow Art Theatre production of Hamlet|production of ''Hamlet'']] in 1911-12, which experimented with symbolist [[monodrama]] as a basis for its staging. [[Meyerhold]]'s production of Blok's ''Puppet Show'' (1906) is usually cited{{By whom|date=September 2009}} as a high point of symbolist theatre in Russia. Two years later, Stanislavski won international acclaim when he staged [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[The Blue Bird (play)|The Blue Bird]]'' in the [[Moscow Art Theatre]].

[[Nikolai Evreinov]] was one of a number of writers who developed a symbolist theory of theatre. Evreinov insisted that everything around us is "theatre" and that nature is full of theatrical conventions, for example, desert flowers [[mimesis|mimicking]] stones, mice feigning death in order to escape cats' claws, and the complicated dances of some birds. Theatre, for Evreinov, was a universal symbol of existence.

The '''Stolpersteine in Prague-Holešovice''' lists the [[Stolpersteine]] in a district [[Holešovice]] ({{IPA-cs|ˈɦolɛʃovɪtsɛ}}) of [[Prague]]. The district has been split off. Since 2002 it belongs mainly to Praha 7, but a smaller part belong to Praha 1. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: ''Kameny zmizelých'', stones of the disappeared.

&lt;small&gt;The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

| Ing. Josef Bergmann was born on 2 September 1880 in [[Krymlov]]. He was an engineer and had the Austrian citizenship.

'''''The Evolution of God''''' is a 2009 book by [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]], in which the author explores the history of the concept of [[God]] in the three [[Abrahamic religions]] through a variety of means, including [[archeology]], history, [[theology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. The patterns which link [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] and the ways in which they have changed their concepts over time are explored as one of the central themes.

One of the conclusions of the book that Wright tries to make is a reconciliation [[Relationship between religion and science|between science and religion]].  He also speculates on the future of the concept of God.

==Evolutionary biology==
Among other things, Wright discusses the role of [[evolutionary biology]] in the development of religion. Geneticist [[Dean Hamer]] hypothesized that some people have a specific gene that makes them prone to religious belief, which he calls the [[God gene]], and that over time natural selection has favored these people because their spirituality leads to optimism. Wright, however, thinks the tendency towards religious belief is not an adaptive trait influenced by natural selection, but rather a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] - a trait that happens to be supported by adaptations originally selected for other purposes. Wright states that the human brain approaches religious belief based on how it adapted to survive and reproduce in early hunter-gatherer societies.

He points out four key traits of religion that align with the human brain's survival adaptations:
*Its claims can be surprising, strange, and even counterintuitive.
*It claims to show what causes good and bad things to happen.
*It tells people that they can control these causes and increase the ratio of good to bad results.
*It is hard to falsify or disprove.
Humans have adapted to pay attention to surprising and confusing information, because it could make the difference between life and death. (For instance, if a person left the campsite and mysteriously never returned, it would be wise for the others to be on guard for a predator or some other danger.) Understanding and controlling cause and effect also takes top priority in the human brain, since humans live in complex social groups where predicting and influencing the actions and thoughts of others gains them allies, status, and access to resources. As human cognitive abilities and curiosity expanded over the centuries, their investigation of cause and effect expanded from the strictly social context out into the world at large, opening the doors for religions to explain things like weather and disease.

Though some of these explanations were strange and perhaps dubious, the fact that they could not be completely disproven lent them credibility; it was better to be cautious than dead. Wright uses an example from the [[Haida people]], indigenous to the northwest coast of North America, who would try to appease killer whale deities to calm storms out at sea; they would pour fresh water into the ocean or tie tobacco or deer tallow to the end of a paddle. While some people certainly died despite these offerings, those who survived were a testament to the ritual's possible efficacy.

Mysterious and unproven beliefs can also persist in a culture because human brains have adapted to agree with the group consensus even if it goes against one's better judgment or personal beliefs, since a person alienated from the group loses protection, food, and mates. Wright cites the [[Asch conformity experiments]] and even posits that [[Stockholm syndrome]] is not so much a syndrome as a natural product of evolution, the brain's way of ensuring that a person accepts and is accepted by his or her new social group. In addition, beliefs can persist because once a person publicly announces a belief, social psychologists have found that he or she is inclined to focus on evidence supporting that belief while conveniently ignoring evidence contradicting it, a logical fallacy known as [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]].

==Reviews==
Journalist and political commentator [[Andrew Sullivan]] gave the book a positive review in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', saying that the book "...gave me hope that we can avoid both the barrenness of a world without God and the horrible fusion of fundamentalism and weapons of mass destruction." &lt;ref&gt;[http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/05/the-evolution-of-god.html Andrew Sullivan's blog post linking to his review], from ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article6255785.ece Sullivan's full review of the book] from ''[[The Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' religion editor, [[Lisa Miller (journalist)|Lisa Miller]], described ''The Evolution of God'' as a reframing of the [[faith]] vs. reason debate. Drawing a contrast to such authors as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]], Miller gives an overall positive review of the book's approach to the examination of the concept of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/199697 Let’s Talk About God] from ''[[Newsweek]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Yale professor of psychology [[Paul Bloom (professor)|Paul Bloom]] said, "In his brilliant new book, “The Evolution of God,” Robert Wright tells the story of how God grew up."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/books/review/Bloom-t.html?_r=1 Review of ''The Evolution of God''] from ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom sums up Wright's controversial stance as, "Wright’s tone is reasoned and careful, even hesitant, throughout, and it is nice to read about issues like the morality of Christ and the meaning of jihad without getting the feeling that you are being shouted at. His views, though, are provocative and controversial. There is something here to annoy almost everyone."

However, in a ''New York Times'' review that included a reply from Wright, [[Nicholas Wade]], a writer for the "Science Times" section, notes the book is "a disappointment from the Darwinian perspective", because evolution "provides a simpler explanation for moral progression than the deity Wright half invokes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/the-non-evolution-of-god/ The Non-Evolution of God], a July 2009 blog post from the ''New York Times'' website&lt;/ref&gt; Wright replied to Wade's comments, saying Wade had misunderstood Wright's argument and that "The deity (if there is one–and I’m agnostic on that point) would be realizing moral progress through evolution’s creation of the human moral sense (and through the subsequent development of that moral sense via cultural evolution, particularly technological evolution)."&lt;ref name="nyteog2"&gt;[http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/non-evolution-of-god-part-2/ Non-Evolution of God, Part 2], a July 2009 blog post from the ''New York Times'' website&lt;/ref&gt;  Wade replied that "evolution seems to me a sufficient explanation for the moral progress that Mr. Wright correctly discerns in the human condition, so there seemed no compelling need to invoke a deity."&lt;ref name="nyteog2"/&gt;

==Promotional appearances==

"'''The Uninvited'''" is the tenth episode of the first series of ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', a British 1960s [[Supermarionation]] television series co-created by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]]. Written by [[Alan Fennell]] and directed by [[Desmond Saunders]], it was first broadcast on [[ATV Midlands]] on 2 December 1965.

In this episode, ''[[Thunderbird 1|Thunderbirds 1]]'' crashes in the [[Sahara Desert]] after being shot down by three unidentified aircraft. Two archaeologists rescue Scott, but one good turn deserves another, and later on, Scott finds himself rushing back to the desert when the pair become entombed in the lost pyramid of Khamandides.

==Plot==
[[Scott Tracy]] (voiced by [[Shane Rimmer]]) is returning to [[Tracy Island]] in ''[[Thunderbird 1]]'' when he is suddenly attacked by a group of unidentified fighters. ''Thunderbird 1'' is damaged and crash-lands in the [[Sahara]]. On Tracy Island, [[Jeff Tracy|Jeff]] (voiced by [[Peter Dyneley]]) dispatches [[Virgil Tracy|Virgil]], [[Brains (Thunderbirds)|Brains]] and [[Tin-Tin Kyrano|Tin-Tin]] (voiced by [[David Holliday]], [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]] and [[Christine Finn]]) in ''[[Thunderbird 2]]'' to rescue Scott. In the desert, archaeologists Wilson and Lindsey are returning to their base camp after a fruitless expedition when they come across the shot-down ''Thunderbird 1''. Stopping their [[All-terrain vehicle|all-terrain]] truck and supply trailer, they treat Scott's injuries until ''Thunderbird 2'' arrives. Later, with Scott convalescent and ''Thunderbird 1'' repaired by Brains, Wilson and Lindsey reveal that they were searching for the lost [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramid]] of [[Pharaoh]] Khamandides. The International Rescue team head back to Tracy Island the next day.

Wilson and Lindsey resume their journey, but frustration gets the better of Wilson. Driving too fast, he causes the coupling between the truck and the trailer to snap. The trailer rolls down a slope and explodes, destroying nearly all of the men's food, water and fuel and damaging their radio. They use the truck's remaining fuel to travel to a waterhole 40 miles away but arrive to find it bone-dry. As a last, desperate resort, the men use the failing radio to send out a [[distress call]] to International Rescue. On ''[[Thunderbird 5]]'', [[Alan Tracy]] (voiced by [[Matt Zimmerman (actor)|Matt Zimmerman]]) has just relieved [[John Tracy (Thunderbirds)|John]] (voiced by [[Ray Barrett]]) as space monitor when he picks up Wilson and Lindsey's faint transmission. Jeff dispatches Scott in ''Thunderbird 1'' to find and rescue the men.

In the desert, Lindsey spots a mysterious object on the horizon – the lost pyramid of Khamandides. Using the last of their fuel, the men drive up to the pyramid. As Lindsey deciphers [[hieroglyph]]s on the side – hailing Khamandides as "Lord of the Eternal Fountain" – a block rises up to form an entrance to the interior. The men proceed but find themselves entombed when the block falls back into place. Deeper inside, they find mounds of treasure. They also discover that the Eternal Fountain is real and drink from it.

Scott arrives at the pyramid and follows Wilson and Lindsey through the one-way door. Lindsey, traumatised by his recent experiences, accuses of Scott of trying to steal his new-found riches and pulls a gun on him. A shootout between Lindsey and Scott ensues. Scott loses his gun but is saved by the arrival of two armed men, who blast Lindsey's gun out of his hand, knocking him out. The strangers conduct Scott, Wilson and the unconscious Lindsey to the pyramid's control centre in a [[monorail]] car. This journey takes them over a [[refinery]] where men in gas masks are using a highly toxic and explosive gas to refuel fighters identical to those that shot down Scott.

Jeff is concerned by Scott's lack of contact and dispatches Virgil and [[Gordon Tracy|Gordon]] (voiced by David Graham) in ''Thunderbird 2'' to investigate. Seeing ''Thunderbird 2''{{'}}s arrival, the pyramid's inhabitants prepare to attack it with [[ground-to-air missile]]s, but before these are launched Wilson punches one of the guards to the floor and Scott, having taken back his gun, shoots several others. A stray bullet hits a control panel, causing the missiles to launch but detonate harmlessly in mid-air. Scott and Wilson take the monorail back to the entrance, with Scott shooting at the refinery workers as they go. The gas is inadvertently released into the refinery, starting a series of explosions. Scott, Wilson and Lindsey, who has just regained consciousness, reach the entrance to find it open and quickly lift off in ''Thunderbird 1''. ''Thunderbird 1'' and ''Thunderbird 2'' clear the area just before the final explosion destroys the pyramid.

==Production==
"The Uninvited" was the fifth episode of ''Thunderbirds'' to be produced. Originally filmed in late 1964 as a 25-minute episode, in January the following year it was extended to 50 minutes to satisfy [[AP Films]]' sponsor [[Lew Grade]], who had been impressed with the [[Trapped in the Sky|pilot episode]] and ordered that all episodes of ''Thunderbirds'' be re-written to fill a one-hour [[timeslot]].&lt;ref name="Pixley2000"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Fantasy Flashback: ''Thunderbirds'' – 'Sun Probe'|journal=[[TV Zone]]|last1=Pixley|first1=Andrew|issue=131|date=October 2000|publication-date=September 2000|publisher=[[Visual Imagination]]|location=London, UK|issn=0957-3844|oclc=226121852|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The additional material for "The Uninvited", which had originally been titled "Desert of Danger",&lt;ref name="Bentley2008"/&gt; consists of the shoot-down of ''[[Thunderbird 1]]'', the rescue of Scott and the character's subsequent recovery on [[Tracy Island]].&lt;ref name="Bentley2015"/&gt; The filming of these new scenes coincided with the production of "Desperate Intruder" and "[[30 Minutes After Noon]]".&lt;ref name="Bentley2015"/&gt;

Actor [[Matt Zimmerman (actor)|Matt Zimmerman]], who voiced Lindsey, fondly remembers the dialogue recording for this episode: "I had to yell and scream, 'Hahaha! You won't take me alive, Tracy!' We had a lot of fun doing that one."&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the script refers to the pyramid tribe as "the Zombites", they remain unnamed in the episode itself.&lt;ref name="Bentley2008"/&gt; The Zombite fighter aircraft are re-dressed versions of the WASP fighters that appear in ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley 2005, p. 68"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;68.&lt;/ref&gt;

This episode marks the first appearance of [[Grandma Tracy]].&lt;ref name="Hearn2015"/&gt; The model of Wilson and Lindsey's desert truck would later appear in "[[The Mighty Atom (Thunderbirds)|The Mighty Atom]]", "Martian Invasion" and "Cry Wolf". The ''[[Thunderbird 3]]'' launch sequence is recycled from "[[Sun Probe]]".&lt;ref name="Pixley2000"/&gt; 

==Broadcast==
First broadcast on 2 December 1965, "The Uninvited" was transmitted as the tenth episode of ''Thunderbirds'' for both the series' original run on [[Associated Television]] and the majority of 1960s repeat runs. A number of scenes were omitted from the two-part version that was shown in some UK regions.&lt;ref name="Bentley2015"/&gt;

==Reception==
Series co-creator [[Sylvia Anderson]] describes "The Uninvited" as "good fun but a little too adventurous for our puppet cast", though she praises the episode's special effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Anderson | first1 = Sylvia | author1-link = Sylvia Anderson | title = Yes, M'Lady | year = 1991 | publisher = Smith Gryphon | location = London, UK | isbn = 978-1-85685-011-7 | page = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for [[Panini UK]], Chris Bentley comments positively on "The Uninvited", stating that it "entertainingly re-shapes the series' format, illustrating the potentially wide variety of stories that can be told within the International Rescue framework." He also commends the episode's use of [[Action fiction|action]].&lt;ref name="Bentley2015"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Thunderbirds – A Complete Guide to the Classic Series | editor1-last = Hearn | editor1-first = Marcus | last1 = Bentley | first1 = Chris | publisher = [[Panini UK]] | location = Tunbridge Wells, UK | date = September 2015 | isbn = 978-1-84653-212-2 | page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus Hearn, author of ''Thunderbirds: The Vault'', has mixed views on the episode. He describes the final battle with the Zombites as being "staged in the explosive style of the 1960s [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' films]]" but questions Lindsey's fit of homicidal rage against Scott, which he considers to be "out of character". Hearn also criticises the Zombites as villains, noting that their hostility and motives for living underground are never explained. He suggests that the plot concerning the quest for a lost pyramid would not have looked out of place in an episode of ''Stingray''.&lt;ref name="Hearn2015"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thunderbirds: The Vault|last1=Hearn|first1=Marcus|year=2015|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-753-55635-1|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Fox of ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' magazine gives "The Uninvited" a rating of five out of five, calling it a "quality episode". He praises the setting as well as the Zombites, whom he describes as "hilarious" and "hardly your average bunch of pyramid-dwelling [[undead]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=TV View|magazine=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst Special]]|issue=65|last1=Fox|first1=Tom|editor-last1=Payne|editor-first1=Andrew|date=August 2004|publisher=Visual Imagination|location=London, UK|issn=0958-7128|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virgil Anson Lewis''' (July 6, 1848, [[West Columbia, West Virginia|West Columbia, Virginia]]—December 5, 1912, [[Mason City, West Virginia]]) was a historian of the U.S. state of [[West Virginia]]. He was prominent in education and history writing in his home state, serving as the first State Historian and Archivist of West Virginia (1905–1912).

==Biography==
Lewis was born in a [[log cabin]] in [[Mason County, West Virginia|Mason County]], then part of Virginia, to George W. and Lucie Edwards Lewis. Upon the death of his father in 1858, Lewis, the oldest child, was compelled to go to work to support the family. He continued his education, however, working as a printer’s assistant and later as a shipping clerk. Lewis taught for many years in county schools and, in 1878, was appointed the principal of the Buffalo Academy in neighboring [[Putnam County, West Virginia|Putnam County]]. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1879, but decided not to become a lawyer, returning to teaching. In 1886, he married Elizabeth Stone of Mason City.

In 1890 he helped organize the West Virginia Historical and Antiquarian Society, and in 1892 became editor of the ''Southern Historical Magazine''. Lewis was elected State Superintendent of Free Schools in 1892 and was granted an A.M. in history from [[West Virginia University]] the following year. His 1896 textbook ''History and Government of West Virginia'' was utilized statewide in public schools for over fifty years. In 1905, Governor [[William M. O. Dawson]] appointed him first director of the Bureau of Archives and History, and he served in that position until his death.

==Legacy==
*The [[Shumaker-Lewis House]] was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.
*The West Virginia Historical Society’s Virgil A. Lewis Award is named in his honor.

The limits of ''Aryavarta'' varies from text to text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbuch der Orientalistik: Indien|last=Scharfe|first=Hartmut|publisher=BRILL|year=|isbn=9004090606|location=|pages=12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These texts also name other parts of the Indian subcontinent as ''Brahmavarta'', ''Madhyadesha'', ''Panchala'' and others, with neither clear boundaries nor details about who lived in them.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Classical sources==
The ''[[Manu Smriti|Manusmṛti]]'' (2.22) gives the name to "the tract between the [[Himalayas|Himalaya]] and the [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya ranges]], from the Eastern Sea ([[Bay of Bengal]]) to the Western Sea ([[Arabian Sea]])".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 70|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]] (2014), ''Ancient Religions, Modern Politics: The Islamic Case in Comparative Perspective'', Princeton University Press, p.68: "Aryavarta [...] is defined by Manu as extending from the Himalayas in the north to the Vindhyas of Central India in the south and from the sea in the west to the sea in the east."&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Kalpa (Vedanga)#Dharma Sutras|Vasistha Dharma Sutra]]'' I.8-9 and 12-13 locates the Āryāvarta to the west of the disappearance of the [[Sarasvati River]] in the desert and Arabian sea, to the east of the Kālakavana, to the south of the [[Pariyatra Mountains]] and the Vindhya Range and to the north of the Himalayas.{{sfn|Neelis|2010|p=194}}
 
The [[Baudhayana sutras|Baudhayana ''Dharmasutra'' (BDS) 1.1.2.10]] gives similar definitions and declares that Āryāvarta is the land that lies west of Kālakavana, east of [[Adarsana]], south of the [[Himalayas]] and north of the Vindhyas, but in BDS 1.1.2.11 Āryāvarta is confined to the [[doab]] of the [[Ganges]]-[[Yamuna]], and BDS 1.1.2.13-15. [[Patanjali]]'s {{IAST|[[Mahābhāṣya]]}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} defines Āryāvarta like the ''Vasistha [[Dharmaśāstra|Dharmasutra]]''.

The [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] king in the tenth century was titled the ''Maharajadhiraja of Aryavarta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Hind: Early medieval India and the expansion of Islam, 7th-11th centuries|author=André Wink|publisher=BRILL|year=2002|isbn=978-0-391-04173-8|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;
