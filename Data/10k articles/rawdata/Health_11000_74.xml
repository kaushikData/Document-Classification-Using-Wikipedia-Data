The [[abortion]] rate in [[Iceland]] is relatively high, in comparison to other [[Nordic countries]].

==Legislation==
Abortion in Iceland was legalized on a number of grounds on 22 May 1975. Although the law does not allow abortions to be performed on request, they are allowed in various medical and social circumstances. Medically, an abortion is lawful if a pregnancy threatens a woman's physical or mental health, if the [[fetus]] has a serious [[congenital defect]], or if the woman is deemed incapable of caring for a child because of her age or mental disability. Social grounds for allowing abortion include: if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest; if the woman has had several children already with only brief periods between pregnancies; if the woman lives in a particularly difficult family situation; or if the woman's or her partner's ill health prevents them from being able to care for a child.&lt;ref name=unitednations/&gt;

Abortion is only legal if performed within the first 16 weeks of pregnancy, unless a pregnancy threatens the woman's health or the fetus has a deformity.&lt;ref name=unitednations/&gt; All Icelandic women who undergo abortions are required to receive counselling both prior to and following the procedure, including education about [[contraceptive]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1869009.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2 June 2002|title=Europe's terms for terminations|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of an unlawful abortion carries a sentence of between five and seven years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=unitednations/&gt;

In April 2017, the Government proposed making changes to abortion legislation in Iceland so that abortion would no longer be described as "fetus destruction" ("fóstureyðing"), but would instead be described as "pregnancy interruption" ("þungunarrof").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visir.is/g/2017170229206/fostureydingar-verdi-thungunarrof|title=Fóstureyðingar verði þungunarrof  - Vísir|work=visir.is|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
A study published in 2003 found that over the period of 1976-1999, the abortion rate in Iceland rose by 133%, increasing from 9.4 abortions per 1000 women to 21.9 per 1000 women, with the highest regional rates in the [[Reykjavík]] area. The authors noted that Iceland's abortion rate was higher than in any of the other Nordic countries, a trend which they attributed to the limited sex education, early initiation of sexual activity, and less effective use of contraception in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Trends in teenage fertility, abortion, and pregnancy rates in Iceland compared with other Nordic countries, 1976-99|journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica|year=2003|author1=Bender S|author2= Geirsson RT|author3= Kosunen E|volume=82|issue=1|pages=38&amp;ndash;47|pmid=12580838|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0412.2003.820107.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate in Iceland was 14.5 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Landspítali]] offers [[pre-natal]] screening for chromosomal anomalies, and the high rate of pregnancy termination in response to positive results has led to the near-eradication of [[Down syndrome]] in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/down-syndrome-iceland/ |publisher=[[CBS News]] |quote=Since prenatal screening tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, the vast majority of women -- close to 100 percent -- who received a positive test for Down syndrome terminated their pregnancy. |title="What kind of society do you want to live in?": Inside the country where Down syndrome is disappearing |date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abortion]] was fully legalized on 23 October 1986.&lt;ref name="un"&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/slovakia.doc Slovakia - ABORTION POLICY - United Nations]&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions were provided with restrictions in [[Slovakia]] and what is now the [[Czech Republic]] as early as 19 December 1957,&lt;ref name="un"/&gt; but it was the 1986 law which removed the requirement of medical approval for abortions before the twelfth week of [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="un"/&gt; Girls under 16 require parental consent for an abortion, while girls aged 16 and 17 can have the procedure performed without consent but the parents still have to be notified.&lt;ref name="un"/&gt;

To procure an abortion on demand, a woman must have not exceeded the twelfth week of her pregnancy, and she must make her request for an abortion known in writing to her gynaecologist, and  counseling and [[birth control]] information is given to the woman, and she is referred to a hospital to terminate her pregnancy.&lt;ref name="un"/&gt; After twelve weeks, a group of physicians must approve the abortion, which in practice only occurs if there is a chance of irreparable harm for either the [[fetus]] or the mother.&lt;ref name="un"/&gt;

The abortion rate peaked in the late 1980s after the liberalization of the old abortion law, with nearly 40 abortions per 1000 births.&lt;ref name="births"&gt;[http://www.infostat.sk/slovakpopin/abortionx.htm Abortion from InfoStat of Slovakia]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the figure fell below 15 abortions per 1000 births, its lowest rate since the government started tracking abortion figures in 1958.&lt;ref name="births"/&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 13.9 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years. &lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobility==
{{See also|Patient lift}}

Inactive patients must be turned every two hours, which is the minimum time that a [[bed sore]] can develop. To move a bedridden patient to the side, the patient is first pulled closer to the opposite side that they are turning to give room to maneuver. When the patient is turned to the side, a pillow is usually placed to the back to support that position.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, page 1056-1057.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pillow is often placed at the head of the bed to protect the head from any injury when moving a bedridden patient up in bed. Often the patient is turned to one side at a time to place a friction reducing sheet under the patient. When moving up, the patient is asked to bend knees and push with their legs while their chin is to their chest to prevent neck injury. The patient is pulled up either by the friction reducing sheet or [[draw sheet]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, page 1058-1060.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hygiene==

===Bathing===
For a bed bath, a bath blanket is put over the patient and only the area washed is exposed at a time for privacy and warmth. To make a [[glove|mitt]] out of a washcloth, the fingers and palm of the dominant hand are placed over the washcloth and the washcloth is folded over the fingers and palm. The remaining part of the washcloth not covering the fingers and palms will be folded over and tucked in and the thumb will be out of the mitt.&lt;ref name=bedbath&gt;Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, page 896-899.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eyes are cleaned, usually first, without soap to avoid irritation. The eye is cleaned from the inner side near the nose to the outer edge to avoid carrying debris to the [[tear duct]]. The cloth is rinsed or turned before going to the other eye to prevent spreading any organisms. Each area is dried at a time before washing the next area. For perineal care, the perineum is washed from least contaminated to most contaminated to reduce the spread of microorganisms. For females, the labia is spread and washed from the pubic area toward the anal area and not the other way around. For males, the tip of the [[human penis|penis]] is cleaned first and cleaned away from the meatus. In an uncircumcised penis, the [[foreskin]] is retracted and immediately put back in place to avoid compromising circulation and the foreskin is not retracted for children in order to prevent injury.&lt;ref name=bedbath/&gt;

===Toileting===
{{See also|Bedpan}}
[[File:Bettpfanneklein.jpg|thumb|left |A bedpan.]]
[[File:M0354 1951-45-108 1.jpg|thumb|right |A [[fracture bedpan]] used for those with hip fractures.]]
A [[bedpan]] is used for bed bound patients for [[defacation|bowel elimination]] as well urinary elimination for females. Powder is often placed along the ring of the bedpan to help reduce friction but is avoided if contraindicated by issues like allergies or if a stool sample is needed. Raising the head of the bead assists in voiding or defecating.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, page 1263.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dressing===
For those with a weaker side (such as from strokes), the arm on the stronger side is used to dress the weaker side first. When undressing, the arm or leg on the stronger side is pulled out first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strokeassociation.org/STROKEORG/LifeAfterStroke/RegainingIndependence/Dressing-Tips-for-Stroke-Survivors_UCM_310116_Article.jsp|title=Dressing tips for stroke survivors|publisher=[[American Stroke Association]]|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bedmaking===
{{See also|hospital bed|Bed-making}}
A [[fitted sheet]] goes over the mattress. Often a [[draw sheet]], also called lift sheet, is used, where it is placed over the fitted sheet and in the center where it will be under the patient’s midsection. By lifting the draw sheet, it is used to help move the patient. The [[fitted sheet]] and draw sheet, which are those that go under the patient, are firmly tucked in to prevent wrinkles, which can promote skin breakdown. A top sheet and blanket are often placed over the bed and the corners are mitered.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, page 906.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hill-Rom hospital bed.JPG|thumb|left|Hospital bed with mitered corners]]
When making an occupied bed, such as for patients who are unable or have difficulty getting out of bed, one side of the bed is made at a time. Usually, the patient rolls to one side and the old linen under the patient from the opposite side, such as the fitted sheet and draw sheet, is untucked and rolled as close to the patient as possible. The new fitted sheet and draw sheet are then tucked in and also rolled close toward the patient. Then the patient rolls back toward the other side. The old linen that was folded under the patient is removed and the new linen that was also folded under the patient is eased out to make the other side of the bed.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, page 910-911.&lt;/ref&gt; For those for whom it is contraindicated to roll to the side, such as those recovering from [[hip replacement]] surgery, then the patient sits up in bed while the top half of the bed is made and afterwards the bottom half of the bed is made.

==Feeding==
To maintain self-esteem, the person is involved as much as possible. His or her preferences are asked regarding the order of items eaten. Condiments are added and food cut according to patient preferences. Dentures, hearing aids or glasses are put in place before mealtime.&lt;ref name=nutrition&gt;Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, page 1184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swallowing precautions===
For those with [[dysphagia]], the patient is placed on aspiration (choking) precautions. The rate of feeding and size of bites are adjusted to patient’s tolerance. The diet would be modified according to the nutrition consult, such as chopping, mincing, pureeing or thickening liquids because they are easier to swallow than thin liquids. Solids and liquids are alternated to help with swallowing. The patient ideally sits upright and tucks the chin towards the chest during swallowing to help prevent aspiration. Signs of aspiration include coughing, choking, [[cyanosis]], voice changes and regurgitation. A 30-minute rest period prior to mealtime is provided to give less difficulty with swallowing.&lt;ref name=nutrition/&gt;

===Visually impaired===
For [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] patients, using a clock face analogy to relate the position of items is common. It is recommended to place foods and dishes in similar location at each meal for familiarity. For beverage, straws are used when possible, if not contradicted by dysphagia, in order to prevent spilling.&lt;ref name=nutrition/&gt;

===Suicide precautions===
For those on suicide precautions, food is served in plastic or paper containers with plastic utensils (no knives) and sharp items should only be used only with continual staff supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.utmb.edu/policies_and_procedures/IHOP/Clinical/General_Clinical_Procedures_and_Care/IHOP%20-%2009.13.38%20-%20Suicide%20Risk%20Screening%20and%20Suicide%20Precautions%20for%20Patients.pdf|title=Suicide risk screening and suicide precautions for patients|publisher=[[University of Texas Medical Branch]]|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Algophagy''' is a feeding [[behaviour]] whereby an animal eats [[algae]] as a food source&lt;ref&gt;Deonier, D. L. (1972). Observations on mating, oviposition, and food habits of certain shore flies (Diptera: Ephydridae).&lt;/ref&gt;. Algae is a group of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms that mostly rely on aquatic environments. They grow low to the ground as they lack vascular tissue, an adaptation postdating their origin. While the group of algal species is large, it is generally accepted that algae is high in nutritional value and often contain a variety of concentrated vitamins and minerals&lt;ref&gt;Belay, A., Ota, Y., Miyakawa, K., &amp; Shimamatsu, H. (1993). Current knowledge on potential health benefits of Spirulina. Journal of applied Phycology, 5(2), 235-241.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Algophagy as a feeding behaviour was first noted in literature by Deonier (1972) in their explanation of feeding habits of shore flies ''[[Diptera|Diptera ephydridae]].'' In this context, this term was used to describe the behaviour of these flies consuming and digesting algal matter. Deonier (1972) found results to support this behaviour, but this feeding style has also been noted in other animals in recent literature.

While this behaviour has been noted in a variety of insects (specifically ''[[Ameletus]]'' mayflies), it has also been observed in other [[invertebrates]] such as the crab ''[[Carcinus maenas]]'' and the [[Nanorchestidae|''Nanorchestes'']] mite. Additionally, this behaviour has been noted in [[vertebrates]] such as the chimpanzee ''[[Pan troglodytes]],'' the sheep ''[[Ovis aries]],'' and the chicken ''[[Gallus gallus domesticus]].'' This feeding behaviour has more recently been adopted by [[humans]] as well. 

== Examples in invertebrates ==
Algophagy is a feeding behaviour found commonly amongst many invertebrate species. Some examples of these observations include the mayfly, mites, and certain species of crab.
[[File:Ameletid_mayfly,_Ameletus_subnotatus_(25675873434).jpg|thumb|Ameletus mayfly in an algae bed]]
[[Mayfly|Mayflies]] are a group of [[insects]] found to feed off of [[Epilithic|epilithic algae]] from near streams in [[New Mexico]], [[U.S.A]]&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C. G., Vormittag, K. A., &amp; Valett, H. M. (1998). Ingestion and digestion of epilithic algae by larval insects in a heavily grazed montane stream. Freshwater Biology, 40(4), 607-623.&lt;/ref&gt;. In a study to examine [[ingestion]] and [[digestion]] of algae by [[larval]] insects, Peterson (1998) analyzed the [[Feces|fecal composition]] of varying insect larvae and [[nymphs]]. All species studied showed epilithic algae in their fecal matter, markedly in the multiple species of mayfly. This study outlines the feeding behaviours used by specifically the ''[[Ameletus]]'' mayflies to feed off of and digest algae as a source of food. This observation has also been noted in species of mites. The ''Nanorchestes'' [[mite]] is a small invertebrate of the ''Pachygnathoid'' genus&lt;ref&gt;Krantz, G. W., &amp; Lindquist, E. E. (1979). Evolution of phytophagous mites (Acari). Annual Review of Entomology, 24(1), 121-158.&lt;/ref&gt; that lives in the ground and is often found in [[extremophilic]] conditions. Krantz and Lindquist (1979) made observations of these mites feeding and surviving off of [[green algae]], while also delving into the background theory behind this theory. The authors argue that algal [[microflora]] predates that of [[vascular plants]], a step to understanding the evolutionary pathway that follows algophagy. Because of this flora timeline, the mites relied on algae as an early source of nutrition, an example in support of algophagy as a feeding behaviour. These examples of this feeding behaviour are also supported by observations of certain species of crab. The [[green crab]] is a highly [[invasive species]] found on nearly all continents of Earth. This [[littoral]] crab is an [[omnivore]] with a large array of preferred foods, forming an important ecological connection with many ocean environments. In a study performed by Ropes (1968) 3,979 green crabs were sampled and their gut contents were analyzed to reveal that algae was one of the two consumed plant foods&lt;ref&gt;Ropes, J. W. (1968). The feeding habits of the green crab, Carcinus maenas (L.). Fishery Bulletin, 67(2), 183-203&lt;/ref&gt;. This was replicated in other studies such as that of Baeta, Cabral, Marques, and Pardal (2006) which also found these results nearly 40 years later&lt;ref&gt;Baeta, A., Cabral, H. N., Marques, J. C., &amp; Pardal, M. A. (2006). Feeding ecology of the green crab, Carcinus maenas (L., 1758) in a temperate estuary, Portugal. Crustaceana, 79(10), 1181-1193.&lt;/ref&gt;. This marks yet another incidence of invertebrate algophagy feeding, adding to the growing body of literature to explain this behaviour.

== Examples in vertebrates ==
Algophagy has been observed in a variety of vertebrate species, such as the chimpanzee, species of sheep, and also in the common chicken.
[[File:Schimpanse_Zoo_Leipzig.jpg|thumb|A chimpanzee species found to consume algae]]
The [[chimpanzee]] is a [[primate]] in the same family as humans and are native to [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. While many chimpanzees are naturally [[hydrophobic]], Sakamaki (1998) found that those in Mahale have been observed to submerge themselves into freshwater and eat algae&lt;ref&gt;Sakamaki, T. (1998). First Record of Algae-Feeding by a Female Chimpanzee at Mahale&lt;/ref&gt;. This observation is the first documentation of a primate using algae in the wild as a food source and is an important marker of possible [[adaptation]] in the species. While the chimpanzee in question, Sally, was one of the only algae-eaters in her group, it was assumed that she had adopted this behaviour from her natal group prior to immigrating to this new environment. Nonetheless, this [[anecdotal]] field study highlights the act of eating algae in chimpanzees. Another example here is found in certain species of sheep. The [[North Ronaldsay sheep]] is native to the island of [[Orkney]] off of [[Scotland]] and had been bred for wool until recently being listed as a vulnerable population. This species relies heavily on [[tidal]] algae as outlined by Paterson and Coleman (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, I. W., &amp; Coleman, C. D. (1982). Activity patterns of seaweed-eating sheep on North Ronaldsay, Orkney. Applied Animal Ethology, 8(1-2), 137-146.&lt;/ref&gt;. The researchers here observed the sheep feeding largely on [[brown algae]], commonly known as [[seaweed]]. The sheep relied on the tides to expose the nutrient rich algae and when the tides made the food inaccessible, the sheep supported their diet with other forms of [[grazing]]. This feeding behaviour exemplifies the use of algophagy in this species of sheep. While algophagy has been viewed in both chimpanzees and sheep, it has also been observed in the common chicken as well. When the Poultry Department of the [[University of Maryland]] did an [[assay]] of dried ''[[Chlorella pyrenoidosa]]'', they found it to be a rich nutrient source that could be substituted into the diet of chickens&lt;ref&gt;Combs, G. F. (1952). Algae (Chlorella) as a source of nutrients for the chick. Science (Washington), 116, 453-454.&lt;/ref&gt;. The researcher behind this outlined the benefits of using this food replacement for chickens in that it improved growth and wellbeing of the chicken. While this example is not a natural one, it does outline the use of algae as a food source for domestic chickens, an important consideration in the future of both algophagy and [[agriculture]].

== Algophagy in humans (other vertebrates) ==
[[File:Spirulina_tablets.jpg|thumb|Spirulina tablets used for human consumption ]]
While this feeding behaviour is not commonly associated with [[human evolution]] or adaptation, it has gained some momentum in recent application. New dieting and food trends have veered towards the inclusion of [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] into supplements. Spirulina is a [[blue-green algae]] that is used to supplement a variety of nutrients including essential [[proteins]], [[vitamins]], and [[minerals]]. In a past review of spirulina by Belay, Ota, Miyakawa, and Shimamatsu (1993), it was outlined that the algae could even be correlated to reduced risk of cholesterol problems, cancer, and heavy metal nephrotoxicity&lt;ref&gt;Belay, A., Ota, Y., Miyakawa, K., &amp; Shimamatsu, H. (1993). Current knowledge on potential health benefits of Spirulina. Journal of applied Phycology, 5(2), 235-241.&lt;/ref&gt;. Spirulina is relatively popular among dietary supplement enthusiasts and can be used in a varied of forms from capsules, to smoothies, to baked goods. This outlines a contemporary example of algophagy in humans that can help us appreciate the scope and breadth of algophagy in the animal kingdom

The '''Angang Sewage Disposal Plant''' is a [[sewage treatment plant]] located in the city of [[Gyeongju]], [[North Gyeongsang]] province, [[South Korea]]. It began operating in April, 2005 by the co-investment of the Government of North Gyeongsang and Gyeongju City with a fund of 44,300,000,000 [[South Korean won|won]] to install the facilities to prevent the pollution of [[Hyeongsan River]] which is a main water source for Gyeongju and [[Pohang]] residents. The plant is located on a spacious site with 39,000 ㎡ in Homyeong-ri, Gangdong-myeon where nature friendly facilities are also built to provide recreational venues for the locals. Through intercepting sewer pipes with a 56.1&amp;nbsp;km length and 14 [[pumping station]]s, the plant has a capacity in dealing with 18,000 tone of [[domestic sewage]] per day that comes from Angang-eup, and Gangdong-myeon in Gyeongju. The facilities have high-powered disposal equipments which are developed by related industrial companies to maintain the final discharging water as the first or second degree water in quality, so that it is used as [[river maintenance flow]] and [[agricultural water]] in case a [[drought]] occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = [[Yonhap News]]|date = 2005-04-28|language = Korean|url = http://info.waternow.go.kr/jsp/search/search.jsp?query=%C8%AF%B0%E6&amp;target=news&amp;detail_target=&amp;page=34&amp;resultcount=10&amp;sortfield=score&amp;sortorder=desc&amp;range=all&amp;resrch=no&amp;mode=paging|title = 경주 안강하수처리장 준공|author = Ministry of Environment of South Korea|trans-title = The completion of the Angang Sewage Disposal Plant in Gyeongju}}{{dead link|i can't read it, but it looks like a page not found|date = January 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4704">'''Anton Fils''' (also '''Antonín Fils''', '''Johann Anton Fils''', '''Johann Anton Filtz'''), 22 September 1733 (baptized) &amp;ndash; 14 March 1760 (buried) was a German classical composer.

Fils was born in [[Eichstätt]], in the [[Bishopric of Eichstätt]]. Long thought to have been of Bohemian origin (e.g., {{harvnb|Racek|1956}}), despite having been described as "from Bavaria" by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg]] in 1756, his true origins were discovered in the 1960s {{harv|Wolf|2001}}. Fils studied law and theology at the [[University of Ingolstadt]], and in 1754 became part of the "[[Mannheim]]er [[Hofkapelle]]" as a cellist. The [[Mannheim orchestra]] at the time was led by [[Johann Stamitz]] {{harv|Würtz &amp; Wolf|2001}}. In 1757 Fils married Elizabeth Range, and in 1759 the couple bought a house.

Although he died at age 26, he left an extensive body of work, including at least thirty-four [[Symphony|symphonies]]. Although he composed about thirty concertos, mainly for cello and for flute, only about half have survived {{harv|Wolf|2001}}.

Fils died in Mannheim and was buried on 14 March 1760 {{harv|Wolf|2001}}.

In his book ''Ideas for an Aesthetic of Music'' (posthumously published in 1806), author-musician [[Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart]] called Fils "the greatest composer of symphonies who ever lived" {{harv|Schubart|1806|loc=141}}. He also attributed Fils' early death to "his bizarre notion of eating spiders" {{harv|Schubart|1806|loc=141}}. Retellings of this legend were elaborated to include Fils assuring horrified observers that spiders tasted like fresh strawberries {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}. The tale still circulates as a curious bit of classical music trivia ({{harvnb|Moore|2010|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2016}}}}).

It has two goals, one, creating a network of health and wellness infrastructure across the nation to deliver comprehensive primary healthcare services, and another is to provide insurance cover to  at least 40 per cent of India's population which is majorly deprived of secondary and tertiary care services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-rolls-out-ayushman-bharat-scheme-inaugurates-first-health-centre/articleshow/63760067.cms|title=PM Modi rolls out Ayushman Bharat scheme, inaugurates first health centre - Times of India ►|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/ayushman-bharat-national-health-protection-mission|title=Ayushman Bharat - National Health Protection Mission {{!}} National Portal of India|website=www.india.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indu Bhushan appointed as a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Dr Dinesh Arora appointed as deputy CEO of Ayushman Bharat Yojana.&lt;ref name=fe1018/&gt; 

==Features==
Ayushman Bharat consists of two major elements.1. National Health Protection Scheme. 2. Wellness centres. National Health Protection Scheme will provide cashless treatment to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amit Sharma |title=Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana - प्रधानमंत्री जन आरोग्य योजना |url=http://pmjanarogyayojana.in/mera-pmjay-gov-in-beneficiary-list/ |accessdate=28 November 2018 |work=www.wiki.meramaal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; And wellness centres will provide primary care to the patients. In fact, the government will upgrade existing Public Health Centres to Wellness Centres. The welfare scheme has been rolled out on August 15, 2018. The government has roped in multiple agencies to ensure seamless coordination between the centre and states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=pib.nic.in|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=177817|journal=Press Information Bureau, Government of India|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/ayushman-bharat-national-health-protection-mission|title=india government website|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brain''''' is a [[medicine|medical]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] written by [[Robin Cook (novelist)|Robin Cook]]. It describes how a future generation of [[computer]]s will work hard-wired to human brains.

==Plot==

The story starts with a girl Katherine Collins going to a private clinic for a [[pap smear]] but these people [[anesthesia|anesthetize]] her and steal her brain for a secret military project. She is placed in a vat of liquid and her brain is connected to a computer. The same thing happens to other patients too.

The protagonist Dr. Martin Philips, a [[Physician|doctor]] in [[neuroradiology]] at the NYC medical center is involved in creating a self-diagnostic [[x-ray machine]], along with Michaels, who is a researcher graduating from [[MIT]] and also head of the department of [[artificial intelligence]]. Dr. Philips's girlfriend and colleague Dr. Denise Sanger (28 years old) is also involved in the same hospital. Philips and Sanger both find a secret conspiracy in the hospital to steal patients' brains without their consent. They uncover details and find that though they'd suspected Mannerheim the prima donna neurosurgeon, the real villain is the soft-spoken AI researcher Michaels and his military backers. Dr. Philips blows the whistle and seeks [[political asylum]] in Sweden.

'''Bridging Eastern and Western Psychiatry''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: '''Мост между Восточной и Западной психиатрией''') is a non-profit association of professional practitioners and scholars in [[psychiatry]] and related professions. It is also the name of the association's journal. According to their journal, the aim of both the association and the journal is to promote scholarly research and collaboration between Western and Eastern European psychiatrists.&lt;ref&gt;Di Fiorino, Mario and Figueira, Maria Luisa (2003). [http://www.psyter.org/inglese/articolo.php?ID=168 "A Presentation"]. ''Bridging Eastern and Western Psychiatry'', Vol 1, No. 1. Retrieved 27 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The association was established in 2002 by [[Maria Luisa Figueira]] and [[Mario Di Fiorino]] and is based in Italy. The first issue of  ''Bridging Eastern and Western Psychiatry'' was published in 2003 with an issue devoted to [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] and dissociative phenomena. The journal, whose [[editors-in-chief]] are Figuerira and Di Fiornino, is published annually in two volumes, one in English and one in Russian.

The association also organizes conferences, symposia, and workshops in both Western and Eastern European countries

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4235">'''Capital punishment in the Netherlands''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''doodstraf in Nederland'') was abolished in 1870 in [[criminal law]] after the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] recognized it was "cruel and rude". The bill was introduced by liberal-catholic [[List of Ministers of Justice of the Netherlands|Minister of Justice]] Franciscus van Lilaar and debated in both the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]] and [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] for seven days before approval. Following the abolition of the death penalty, [[life imprisonment]] was made an official punishment in 1878.

A few years after gaining independence in 1815, the Kingdom of the Netherlands determined that the death penalty could be carried out through beheading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dp.spring96.org/en/cancel/82191|title=Netherlands|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1945 and 1952 several war criminals from [[World War II]] were sentenced to death by the [[Bijzonder Gerechtshof]] for treason of the State of the Netherlands and the deportation of Dutch Jews. The last persons to be executed under [[military law]] were [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officers [[Andries Jan Pieters]] and Artur Albrecht in March 1952. Capital punishment remained a legal military option until 1983 when it was explicitly forbidden in the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]]. In 1991, all references to the death penalty were removed from Dutch law.

Today the Netherlands operates a clear policy against capital punishment, not participating in [[extradition]] if the suspect has a chance of receiving the death penalty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Constitution==
*Article 114 of the Constitution (Dutch: ''Grondwet'') prohibits sentencing someone to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001840/geldigheidsdatum_25-12-2012#Hoofdstuk6_Artikel114|title=wetten.nl  - Wet- en regelgeving - Grondwet - BWBR0001840|work=overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that as a result, the death penalty does not exist in the Netherlands. It also means that the death penalty cannot be added to future or existing law articles. That would conflict with the Dutch Constitution Law.

==Death Penalty in the Netherlands today==

The Reformed Political Party (Dutch: [[Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij]], SGP), a [[Christian right]] party, supports the reintroduction of the death penalty in the Netherlands. They base this on the [[Bible]], specifically on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis 9:6]], "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man," and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus 21:12]], "He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death."

'''Castration anxiety''' is the [[fear]] of [[emasculation]] in both the literal and metaphorical sense. Castration anxiety is an overwhelming fear of damage to, or [[penis removal|loss of]], the penis; one of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s earliest [[psychoanalytic theories]].&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;Schwartz, Bernard J. (1955) The measurement of castration anxiety and anxiety over loss of love. Journal of Personality, 24 204-219.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although Freud regarded castration anxiety as a universal human experience, few empirical studies have been conducted on the topic. Much of the research that has been done on the topic was done decades ago, although still relevant today. The theory is that a child has a fear of damage being done to their genitalia by the parent of the same sex (e.g. a son being afraid of his father) as punishment for sexual feelings toward the parent of the opposite sex (e.g. a son toward his mother).&lt;ref name="Farlex Partner Medical Dictionary"&gt;Farlex Partner Medical Dictionary 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that castration anxiety begins between the ages of 3 and 5, otherwise known as the [[phallic stage]] of development according to Freud.&lt;ref name="Feiner"&gt;Feiner, K. (1988) A test of a theory about body integrity: Part 2. ''Psychoanalytic Psychology''. 5(1), 71–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Although typically associated with males, castration anxiety is theorized to be experienced in differing ways for both the male and female sexes&lt;!-- Citation Needed --&gt;.

==Literal==
Castration anxiety is the conscious or unconscious fear of losing all or part of the sex organs, or the function of such. In the literal sense, castration anxiety refers to the fear of having one's genitalia disfigured or removed to punish sexual desires of a child.&lt;ref name="Farlex Partner Medical Dictionary" /&gt;

In Freudian [[psychoanalysis]], castration anxiety (''Kastrationsangst'') refers to an unconscious fear of penile loss originating during the phallic stage of [[psychosexual development]] and lasting a lifetime. According to Freud, when the infantile male becomes aware of differences between male and female genitalia he assumes that the female's penis has been removed and becomes anxious that his penis will be cut off by his rival, the father figure, as punishment for desiring the mother figure.&lt;ref name="Freud"&gt;Freud, S. (1954). ''The Origins Of Psycho-Analysis: Letters To Wilhelm Fliess, Drafts And Notes: 1887-1902''. Edited by [[Marie Bonaparte]], [[Anna Freud]], [[Ernst Kris]]. Translated by [[Eric Mosbacher]] and [[James Strachey]]. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 19th century [[Europe]] it was not unheard of for parents to threaten their misbehaving sons with castration or otherwise threaten their genitals.   This theme is explored in the story ''Tupik'' by French writer [[Michel Tournier]] in his collection of stories entitled ''Le Coq de Bruyère'' (1978) and is a phenomenon Freud documents several times.&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud"&gt;Freud, Sigmund. "The Dissolution of the Oedipus Complex." ''On Sexuality''. Vol. 7 of Penguin Freud Library. Trans. James Strachey. Ed. Angela Richards. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976. 313-322.&lt;/ref&gt; In this same period, Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg|Kellogg]] and others in America and English-speaking countries offered to [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] parents [[circumcision]] and in grave instances, ''castration'' of their boys and girls as a terminal ''cure'' and punishment for a wide variety of misbehaviours (notably [[masturbation]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Szm2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA772&amp;lpg=PA772&amp;dq=kellogg+castration+as+punishment#v=onepage&amp;q=kellogg%20castration%20as%20punishment&amp;f=false|title=Religion and American Cultures: Tradition, Diversity, and Popular Expression, 2nd Edition [4 volumes]|last=Laderman|first=Gary|last2=León|first2=Luis|date=2014-12-17|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781610691109|location=|pages=772|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ills, becoming very popular over time.

==Metaphorical==
Castration anxiety can also refer to being castrated symbolically. In the metaphorical sense, castration anxiety refers to the idea of feeling or being insignificant; there is a need to keep one's self from being dominated; whether it be socially or in a relationship.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff and Corwin"&gt;Sarnoff, I., &amp; Corwin S.M., (1959) Castration anxiety and the fear of death. ''Journal of Personality'', 27(3), 374.&lt;/ref&gt;
Symbolic castration anxiety refers to the fear of being degraded, dominated or made insignificant, usually an irrational fear where the person will go to extreme lengths to save their pride and/or perceives trivial things as being degrading making their anxiety restrictive and sometimes damaging.
This can also tie in with literal castration anxiety in fearing the loss of virility or sexual dominance.

==Relation to power and control==

The anxiety aspect of this topic can be completely overwhelming to the individual, and can often breach other aspects of their lives. A link has been found between castration anxiety and fear of death.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff and Corwin" /&gt; Although differing degrees of anxiety are common, young men who felt the most threatened in their youth tended to show chronic anxiety. Because the consequences are extreme, the fear can evolve from potential disfigurement to life-threatening situations. Essentially, castration anxiety can lead to a fear of death, and a feeling of loss of control over one's life.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff and Corwin" /&gt;

To feel so powerless can be detrimental to an individual's mental health. One of the most concerning problems with all of this is the idea that the individual does not recognize that their sexual desires are the cause of the emotional distress.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff and Corwin" /&gt; Because of unconscious thoughts, as theorized in the ideas of psychoanalysis, the anxiety is brought to the surface where it is experienced symbolically. This will lead to the fear associated with bodily injury in castration anxiety, which can then lead to the fear of dying or being killed.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff and Corwin" /&gt;

==Counterpart in females==
It is implied in Freudian psychology that both girls and boys pass through the same developmental stages: [[oral stage|oral]], [[anal stage|anal]], and phallic stages. Freud, however, believed that the results may be different because the anatomy of the different sexes is different.

The counterpart of castration anxiety for females is [[penis envy]]. Penis envy, and the concept of such, was first introduced by Freud in an article published in 1908 titled "On the Sexual Theories of Children". The idea was presumed that females/girls envied those (mostly their fathers) with a penis because theirs was taken from them—essentially they were already "castrated". Freud entertained that the envy they experienced was their unconscious wish to be like a boy and to have a penis.&lt;ref name="Fancher &amp; Rutherford"&gt;Fancher, Raymond E. &amp; Rutherford, Alexandra ''Pioneers of Psychology'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc. New York, London. 2012 {{ISBN|978-0-393-93530-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penis envy, in Freudian psychology, refers to the reaction of the female/young girl during development when she realizes that she does not possess a penis. According to Freud, this was a major development in the identity (gender and sexual) of the girl. The contemporary culture assumes that penis envy is the woman wishing they were in fact a man. This is unrelated to the notion of "small penis syndrome" which is the assumption by the man that his penis is too small. According to Freud's beliefs, girls developed a weaker&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aquestionofexistence.com/Aquestionofexistence/Problems_of_Gender/Entries/2011/8/28_Sigmund_Freud_files/Freud%20Some%20Psychological%20Consequences%20of%20the%20Anatomical%20Distinction%20between%20the%20Sexes.pdf|title=Some Psychological Consequences of the Anatomical Distinction between the Sexes|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|date=1925|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[superego]], which he considered a consequence of penis envy.

Sigmund Freud's views on women created great debate between professionals and nonprofessionals interested in this field. In his 1925 paper "The Psychic Consequences of the Anatomic Distinction between the Sexes", Freud wrote that "women oppose change, receive passively, and add nothing of their own". This quote is not actually in the paper written by Freud.&lt;ref name="Schultz and Schultz"&gt;Schultz, D.P. &amp; Schultz, S.E. (2009). ''Theories of Personality''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his many suggestions, Freud believed that during the phallic stage, young girls distance themselves from their mothers and instead envy their fathers and show this envy by showing love and affection towards their fathers. According to Cohler and Galatzer, Freud believed that all of the concepts related to penis envy were among his greatest accomplishments. However, these are also his most criticized theories as well—most famously by [[Karen Horney]].

==Oedipus complex in boys==

Freud derived this term from the Greek tragedy ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.&lt;ref name="Fancher &amp; Rutherford" /&gt; In this tragedy, the main character, [[Oedipus]], kills his father and marries a woman whom he does not know is his mother.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;Larsen, R. J., &amp; Buss, D. M. ''Psychoanalytic Approaches to Personality, Personality psychology: domains of knowledge about human nature'' Boston: McGraw Hill, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-07-353190-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this irony, Freud used the term [[Oedipus complex]] to indicate this unconscious desire.&lt;ref name="Fancher &amp; Rutherford" /&gt;

According to Freud, the Oedipus complex relates to a universal wish that a boy has, unknowingly, to have his mother all to himself by the removal of his father.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; This complex occurs during the third stage, known as the phallic stage, of Freud's psychosexual stages of personality development.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; It is during this stage that the child learns he has a penis and begins to associate the penis with the pleasure of touching it.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; In addition to this, the child becomes aware of his sexual desire toward the parent of the opposite sex, his mother. According to Freud, this lusting that the child feels toward his mother means that he wants to have sex with her.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; Due to this lusting, the child sees the father as a competitor for the mother's attention and love. Due to this competition, the boy identifies his father as the only obstacle inhibiting him from having his mother.

The conflict aspect of the Oedipus complex arises from within the child.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; The child knows to love and respect his father and yet he finds himself competing with his father for his mother's affection. Additionally, the child also knows that removing the father from the home is wrong. And yet, he finds himself wanting his competitor removed so that he can have his mother all to himself.

Furthermore, the child begins to fear his father. The child understands that the father is superior to the boy in both size and strength and the father could easily use those advantages to prevent the boy from possessing his mother.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; Moreover, boy begins to fear a preemptive strike from the father to take away the cause of the conflict, the boy's penis.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; This fear of losing one's penis is called castration anxiety.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; This anxiety drives the child to give up his sexual desire for his mother, and redirect his attention to becoming more like his father, who already had his mother. This redirecting of attention is called identification.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; It is during this process that the child then identifies the father as a suitable role model. This growth in the child is the start to the resolution of the Oedipal conflict.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt;

Freud believed, however, that the Oedipus complex could never fully be resolved.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; He concluded that these lusting feelings must be repressed beneath the child's conscious awareness.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; This repression is the mind's way of freeing the child from the disturbing anxieties that are related to this complex.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; Freud went further to say that the sexual desires are still within the child and are often expressed in more indirect and appropriate forms of behavior.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt;  A rather typical outlet is found within the child's dreams; within the dreams the child is able to safely express his repressed desires in a non-anxiety forming and socially acceptable manner.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt;

==The Electra complex in girls==

The term [[Electra]] comes from Greek mythology as well. Electra was a Greek character who convinced her brother to kill their mother, but only after the mother had already murdered the father.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; [[Carl Jung]], one of Freud's successors, coined the term the [[Electra complex]] for the Oedipus complex in girls, which also occurs during the third stage of psychosexual development.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; Jung described this complex as the time when the girl begins to develop an awareness of her sex.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; This awareness includes identifying the other children she may encounter as boys or girls and the identification of her parents' sex.

According to Freud, during this stage the child is initially very attached to her mother. However, when the child discovers that she does not have a penis, she redirects her attachment to her father. The child then blames her mother for "castrating" her.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; As a result of her new affection for her father, the child will begin to identify with and mimic her mother out of fear of losing her father's love.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; Similarly to the Oedipus complex, the girl learns her role by identifying with her mother in an attempt to have her father vicariously through her mother.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt;

Freud rejected the idea of the [[Electra complex]] and was even monotonously vague about how the phallic stage of psychosexual development is resolved for girls.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; Freud stated that this complex drags out for girls and may never fully be resolved.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; Because the successful resolution is the result of the development of the [[superego]], Freud stated that women must be morally inferior to men. This notion led this aspect of Freud's developmental theory to not be a widely accepted theory today.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt;

==In the absence of a father==
There is an assumption that the Oedipus complex is resolved when the young boy identifies with his father and gives up the notion that he may become intimate with his mother. There are many studies that look at the effects of the absence of the father on the child's development. However, there are no studies that determine this resolution if the father is unavailable to them. Mary Leichty, of Michigan State University, hypothesized then, "that if the father is not available to play his role at this time (during the development of the Oedipus complex), there will be inadequate resolution of the conflict".&lt;ref name="Leichty"&gt;Leichty, Mary M. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly of Behavior and Development. Vol. 6, No. 4 (July 1960). URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/23082618&lt;/ref&gt;

This hypothesis suggests that when young, a boy could potentially be left in a vulnerable stage where he still believes that becoming intimate with his mother is an option. Freud would assume that this absence of the father may result in the same development that a young girl would experience. The young boy, in Freud's belief, would suffer from an underdeveloped [[superego]], and would essentially make for a less moral human being.

==Empirical testing==

Sarnoff et al. surmised that men differ in their degree of castration anxiety through the castration threat they experienced in childhood.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff and Corwin" /&gt; Therefore, these men may be expected to respond in different ways to different degrees of castration anxiety that they experience from the same sexually arousing stimulus.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff and Corwin" /&gt; The experimenters aimed to demonstrate that in the absence of a particular stimulus, men who were severely threatened with castration, as children, might experience long-lasting anxiety.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff and Corwin" /&gt; The researchers claimed that this anxiety is from the repressed desires for sexual contact with women. It was thought that these desires are trying to reach the men's consciousness.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff and Corwin" /&gt; The experimenters deduced that unconscious anxiety of being castrated might come from the fear the consciousness has of bodily injury.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff and Corwin" /&gt; The researchers concluded that individuals who are in excellent health and who have never experienced any serious accident or illness may be obsessed by gruesome and relentless fears of dying or of being killed.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff and Corwin" /&gt;

In another article related to castration anxiety, Hall et al. investigated whether sex differences would be found in the manifestations of castration anxiety in their subject's dreams.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, C., &amp; van de Castle, R. L. "An empirical investigation of the castration complex in dreams", ''Journal of Personality'', 1965, 33(1), 20. {{DOI|10.1111/1467-6494.ep893396}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers hypothesized that male dreamers would report more dreams that would express their fear of castration anxiety instead of dreams involving castration wish and penis envy.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; They further hypothesized that women will have a reversed affect, that is, female dreamers will report more dreams containing fear of castration wish and penis envy than dreams including castration anxiety.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; The results demonstrated that many more women than men dreamt about babies and weddings and that men had more dreams about castration anxiety than women.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt;

The '''Clara White Mission''' (CWM) is a non-profit organization in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]  founded by [[Eartha M. M. White|Dr. Eartha M. M. White]] that advocates for the poor and provides social services. According to their website, "The Clara White Mission is to reduce homelessness through advocacy, housing, job training and employment by partnering with business and local community resources."&lt;ref name=HISTORY /&gt; CWM created an extensive and diverse network of public and private funding sources.&lt;ref name=HUD /&gt;

==History==

The Clara White Mission was formally founded in 1904, but Clara English White began feeding hungry people in her Clay street neighborhood in the 1880s. During the period between 1900 and 1950, [[Eartha M. M. White|Dr. Eartha M. M. White]], a nationally recognized humanitarian who was Clara's daughter, turned the soup kitchen into an effective social agency.

Clara White died in 1920, but Eartha continued their "mission work", and at the height of the [[great depression]] the operation grew so large, it had to be moved from its residential location. The Globe Theatre had been closed for years, and Eartha White was able to purchase it. The West Ashley Street building was then dedicated in her mother's memory. At the time, the CWM was the only non-profit organization serving daily meals to the needy in Jacksonville.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unf.edu/library/sc/earbio.html UNF Library: Eartha M. M. White Collection - Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509105352/http://www.unf.edu/library/sc/earbio.html |date=2008-05-09 }} University of North Florida Carpenter Library, Eartha M. M. White collection-biography&lt;/ref&gt; The mission incorporated in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idealist.org/if/i/en/av/Org/110846-30 idealist.org] Idealist website, Clara White Mission, Inc.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620231914/http://www.idealist.org/if/i/en/av/Org/110846-30 |date=June 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clara White Mission was Eartha's home for over 40 years and the center of her activities. Besides the original feeding program, the building was home to a myriad of projects and initiatives through the years. The [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) used the mission as the work site for sewing and arts projects during the Depression; the building's top floors housed soldiers stationed in Jacksonville during World War II.&lt;ref name=HISTORY /&gt;

Beginning with Clara and continuing with Eartha, the mission provided rooms to prisoners after their release from jail; they were also fed, given clothing and assistance finding a job. The homeless received similar assistance.

The mission provided hands-on training for cooking/canning and business skills including typing, in addition to [[Braille]] instruction. The facility was renovated in 1946 and local business owners were encouraged to lease office space on the building's first and third floors to help pay the bills.

In 1902, Eartha and Clara White began the "Colored Old Folks Home", which became the "Eartha White Nursing Home". In 1965, construction began on Eartha M. M. White Health Care, Inc., a 125-bed, $780,000.00 facility, initiated by Eartha at age 89.&lt;ref name=HISTORY&gt;[http://www.clarawhitemission.org/history.html] Clara White Mission, History  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327162006/http://www.clarawhitemission.org/history.html |date=March 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GREAT&gt;[http://www.flheritage.com/services/sites/floridians/?section=j Great Floridians @ Florida OCHP] Florida Department of State, Great Floridians 2000 Program&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum===
Throughout Eartha White's life, she actively collected period furniture, historical documents, and photos of Jacksonville's past as well as Black Americans. She solicited donations from all her contacts, both business and personal. The accumulation was housed in a building near Moncrief Springs until her death in 1974, after which many items were stolen or damaged. The remaining documents were turned over to the [[University of North Florida]] for safe keeping; the furniture and [[objets d'art]] were stored by the CWM.

The "Eartha M.M. White Memorial Art and Historical Resource Center" was dedicated on December 17, 1978 at the Clara White Mission. The "museum" is located at the north end of the second floor of the original mission building where Eartha's living quarters were located.&lt;ref name=HISTORY /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unf.edu/library/sc/images/earthawhite644b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821172647/http://www.unf.edu/library/sc/images/earthawhite644b.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-21 |df= }} University of North Florida, Eartha M.M.

==Current programs==
Most of the Mission's programs help the homeless daily:
* The feeding program provides over 400 hot meals each day, seven days a week.
* Transitional housing is provided for up to two years for the homeless to establish themselves in a job and leave the streets.
* Community outreach helps the homeless and at-risk youth avoid behaviors that are destructive.&lt;ref name=BOWL /&gt;
* The drop-in day center is open to the homeless on weekdays, providing showers, laundry facilities, hot &amp; cold drinks, snacks, computer and telephone access.
*Culinary Arts training program for homeless/low-income; with focus on veterans in need
*Janitorial/Construction training program for homeless/low-income; with a focus on veterans in need
Three quarters of area homeless are veterans and counselors are available to assist those seeking to improve their situation.

===Clara at the Cathedral===
[[File:claracathedralSM.jpg|right]]
"Clara's at the Cathedral Café" is a cooperative project between the [[St. John's Cathedral (Jacksonville, Florida)|St. Johns Cathedral]] and the School of Culinary Arts at the mission. Every Friday since April 13, 2007, a luncheon has been prepared by the students and staff from the Mission's culinary school. The meal is reasonably priced and attracts workers from downtown businesses and retirees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diocesefl.org/stjohnscathedral/topic-page.php?page=182 Jacksonville Episcopal Church : Saint John's Cathedral] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725235436/http://diocesefl.org/stjohnscathedral/topic-page.php?page=182 |date=July 25, 2011 }} St. Johns Cathedral webpage, Helping our Neighbors&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catering===
"Ashley Street Catering" is a full-service [[Catering|caterer]] at the mission. They prepare the food, transport it and serve it at the location of the client's event. Most of the staff are graduates of the CWM culinary arts program and all profits are returned to the mission.&lt;ref name=HISTORY /&gt;

'''Clinical nutrition''' is [[nutrition]] of [[patients]] in [[health care]]. [[wiktionary:clinical|Clinical]] in this sense refers to the management of patients, including not only outpatients at [[clinic]]s, but also (and mainly) inpatients in hospitals. It incorporates primarily the scientific fields of [[nutrition]] and [[diet (nutrition)|dietetics]]. It aims to keep a healthy [[Energy balance (biology)|energy balance]] in patients, as well as providing sufficient amounts other nutrients such as protein, vitamins, minerals.

==Methods of nutrition==
Among the [[routes of administration]], the preferred means of nutrition is, if possible, [[oral administration]]. Alternatives include [[enteral administration]] (in [[nasogastric feeding]]) and [[intravenous]] (in [[parenteral nutrition]]).

==Clinical malnutrition==
In the field of clinical nutrition, [[malnutrition]] has causes, epidemiology and management distinct from those associated with malnutrition that is mainly related to poverty.

The main causes of ''clinical malnutrition'' are:
* [[Cachexia]] caused by diseases, injuries and/or aging
* Difficulties with ingestion, such as [[stroke]], [[paresis]], [[dementia]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[dysphagia]]

Clinical malnutrition may also be aggravated by [[iatrogenic]] factors, i.e., the inability of a [[health care]] entity to appropriately compensate for causes of malnutrition.

There are various definitions of clinical malnutrition. According to one of them, patients are defined as ''severely undernourished'' when meeting at least one of the following criteria: [[body mass index|BMI]] [[less than|&lt;]] or = 20&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and/or [[more than|&gt;]] or = 5% unintentional weight loss in the past month and/or &gt; or = 10% unintentional weight loss in the past 6 months. By the same system, the patient is ''moderately undernourished'' if they met at least one of the following criteria: BMI 20.1–22&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and/or 5-10% unintentional weight loss in the past six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kruizenga HM, de Vet HC, Van Marissing CM |title=The SNAQ(RC), an easy traffic light system as a first step in the recognition of undernutrition in residential care |journal=J Nutr Health Aging |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=83–9 |year=2010 |doi= 10.1007/s12603-009-0147-1|pmid=20126953|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''couscous connection''' was an international [[drug trafficking]] gang based in Paris in the 1980s. The gang imported [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]] from Tunisia via Amsterdam and Brussels to Paris, where they distributed the drugs. The trial of the gang members in 1992 received widespread publicity since the older brother of the president of Tunisia was charged and convicted ''in absentia'' for his involvement in laundering the proceeds.

==Investigation==

The investigation began in January 1989 after an informer gave drug squad investigators in [[Belleville, Paris]] the names of three couriers bringing heroin and cocaine from Amsterdam and Brussels to Paris. The police found that the couriers always used rental cars for which they paid in cash. The investigators obtained search warrants and permission to tap telephones. In one of the couriers' apartments they found 180 grams of heroin, a false Dutch driving license, a sawed-off rifle, savings bank receipts and invoices for jewelry purchases using cash.{{sfn|Smadja|1992}}

The investigators traced links to the "Roma brothers", and gradually built up a picture of the import and distribution networks. One of the leads took them to Hedi Ben Hassen, nephew of Frej Guedoura, chief of special services and national security in Tunisia, and Habib Ben Ali, known as Moncef, brother of President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] of Tunisia.{{sfn|Smadja|1992}} In February 1990 the police tried to arrest these two at an airport before they left France for Tunisia. Ben Ali showed his diplomatic passport, explained his relationship to the president, claimed immunity and was allowed to leave.{{sfn|Smadja|1992}}

==Arrest and trial==

The gang had at least 30 members, of whom 25 were arrested and appeared in court.
The leaders of the gang were the six Roma brothers, of whom four appeared in court and two were on the run as of 1992. An international arrest warrant was issued for Habib Ben Ali.{{sfn|Smadja|1992}}

The trial of the "couscous connection", the nickname given to the drug trafficking network, opened on 17 November 1992 in the Fourteenth Chamber of the Paris Criminal Court. Habib Ben Ali was said to have been the bag carrier for the proceeds of the sales of heroin and cocaine trafficked between Tunisia, Amsterdam and Paris, and was charged with laundering drug money and breaking narcotics laws. He did not appear.{{sfn|Broussard|1992}} The normal broadcast in Tunisia of the news program of France's second television channel was suspended during the trial.{{sfn|Couscous connection ... Economist}}
On 30 November 1992 Ben Ali was found guilty ''in absentia'' and sentenced to ten years imprisonment.{{sfn|Impliqué à Paris ... Le Monde}} As part of the same case 23 other gang members, mostly Tunisian, were sentenced to various punishments.{{sfn|La « couscous connection » ... 1995}}

On 1 December 1992 Ben Ali's French lawyer met his client in Tunis. The lawyer gave a press conference in which he claimed there was no evidence that Ben Ali deserved the sentence. He said the conviction was due to political manipulation.{{sfn|Deure|1992}} He blamed Islamic fundamentalists for concocting the charges in an effort to blacken the family name.{{sfn|Couscous connection ... Economist}}
[[Mezri Haddad]] signed an article in ''[[Libération]]'' in 1992 about the "Couscous connection".{{sfn|Mezri Haddad|1992}} According to the Canadian writer Lise Garon, "Haddad is probably the only Tunisian to have signed an article about the involvement of the president's brother in international drug trafficking."{{sfn|Garon|1998|p=72}}

Ben Ali was found murdered on 14 May 1996 in a Tunis apartment.{{sfn|Oumma Media|2012}} There was much speculation about who had ordered his death.{{sfn|Lachheb|2011}}

A '''dew pond''' is an artificial [[pond]] usually sited on the top of a hill, intended for watering livestock. Dew ponds are used in areas where a natural supply of surface water may not be readily available. The name dew pond (sometimes '''cloud pond''' or '''mist pond''') is first found in the ''Journal of the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England|Royal Agricultural Society]]'' in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': dew-pond&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the name, their primary source of water is believed to be rainfall rather than [[dew]] or [[mist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A method of constructing the base layer using chalk puddle was described in ''The Field'' 14 December  1907. 
A Sussex farmer born in 1850 tells how he and his forefathers made dew ponds:
{{cquote|''The requisite hole having been excavated, the chalk was laid down layer by layer, while a team of oxen harnessed to a heavy broad-wheeled cart was drawn round and round the cup shaped hole to grind the chalk to powder. Water was then thrown over the latter as work progressed, and after nearly a day of this process, the resultant mass of puddled chalk, which had been reduced to the consistency of thick cream, was smoothed out with the back of a shovel from the centre, the surface being left at last as smooth and even as a sheet of glass. A few days later, in the absence of frost or heavy rain, the chalk had become as hard as cement, and would stand for years without letting water through. This old method of making dew ponds seems to have died out when the oxen disappeared from the Sussex hills, but it is evident that the older ponds, many of which have stood for scores of years practically without repair, are still more watertight than most modern ones in which Portland cement has been employed.'' &lt;ref name=eam96&gt;Martin (1915: 96)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

If the pond's temperature is kept low, evaporation (a major water loss) may be significantly reduced, thus maintaining the collected rainwater. According to researcher Edward Martin, this may be attained by building the pond in a hollow, where cool air is likely to gather, or by keeping the surrounding grass long to enhance heat radiation.&lt;ref name=eam133&gt;Martin (1915: 133-135; 159)&lt;/ref&gt; As the water level in the basin falls a well of cool, moist air tends to form over the surface, restricting evaporation.&lt;ref name=eam160&gt;Martin (1915: 160)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Dew pond west leake.jpg|thumb|Dew pond on hill above [[West Leake]] Nottinghamshire. &lt;br&gt;{{Coord|52.836462|-1.215963|format=dms}}]]
The mystery of dew ponds has drawn the interest of many historians and scientists, but until recent times there has been little agreement on their early origins. It was widely believed that the technique for building dew ponds has been understood from the earliest times, as [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]] tells us in ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''"...the Flint Men made the Dewpond under Chanctonbury Ring."&lt;/ref&gt;  The two [[Chanctonbury Ring|Chanctonbury Hill]] dew ponds were dated, from [[flint tool]]s excavated nearby and similarity to other dated earthworks, to the [[Neolithic|neolithic period]]. [[Landscape archaeology]] too seemed to demonstrate that they were used  by the inhabitants of the nearby [[hill fort]] (probably from an earlier date than that of the surviving [[bronze age|late Bronze Age]] structure) for watering cattle.&lt;ref name=hubbards/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There is equal controversy on the means of replenishment of dew ponds.  Experiments conducted in 1885 to determine the origin of the water found that dew forms not from dampness in the air but from moisture in the ground directly beneath the site of the condensation: dew, therefore, was ruled out as a source of replenishment.&lt;ref name=johnsonw/&gt; Other scientists have pointed out that the 1885 experiments failed to take into account the insulating effect of the straw and the cooling effect of the damp clay: the combined effect would be to keep the pond at a lower temperature than the surrounding earth and thus able to condense a disproportionate share of moisture.&lt;ref name=hubbards&gt;{{cite book

In turn these conclusions were disproved in the 1930s, when it was pointed out that the heat-retaining quality of water (its [[Specific heat capacity|thermal capacity]]) was many times greater than that of earth and therefore the air above a pond in summer would be the last place to attract condensation. The deciding factor, it was concluded, is the extent of the saucer-shaped basin extending beyond the pond itself: the large basin would collect more rainfall than a pond created without such a surrounding feature.&lt;ref name=pugsley&gt;{{cite book

Dew ponds are still common on the downlands of southern [[England]], the [[Derbyshire|North Derbyshire]] and [[Staffordshire Moorlands|Staffordshire moorlands]] and in [[Nottinghamshire]].

==Measuring of dew production==
At the dew pond Helmfleeth in the municipality Poppenbüll (Peninsula Eiderstedt in Schleswig-Holtstein, Germany), In situ measurements of the evaporation and condensation were taken. For this reason, meteorological measuring instruments and a floating evaporation pan after Brockamp &amp; Werner (1970) were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brockamp|first1=B.|last2=Werner|first2=J.|title=Ein weiterentwickeltes Verdunstungsmessgerät für Kleingewässer (als Beitrag zur hydrologischen Dekade der UNESCO)|journal=Meteorol.

==Reproductions of historical dew ponds==
In 2014, the traditional technique was verified by means of modern building material at reproductions of dew ponds in East Friesland. In this context, various techniques were tried in two terrestrial hollows. Commercially available PVC-film was used for the sealing and foam glass gravel for the insulation. The construction was carried out by craftsmen and the climatological analysis by Werner and Coldewey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=J.|last2=Coldewey|first2=W.

== Cultural references to dew ponds ==
The nursery rhyme [[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack &amp; Jill]] may refer to a dew pond at the peak of a hill rather than a well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1662:_Jack_and_Jill|title=1662: Jack and Jill - explain xkcd|website=www.explainxkcd.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7979">'''Dignity of risk''' is the idea that [[self-determination]] and the right to take reasonable risks are essential for [[dignity]] and [[self esteem]] and so should not be impeded by excessively-cautious [[caregiver]]s, concerned about their [[duty of care]]. The concept is applicable to adults who are under care such as [[elderly care|elderly]] people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-22/risky-activities-could-improve-quality-of-life-for-elderly/6939166 |author=Norman Hermant |title=Dignity of Risk: Elderly should be allowed to do 'risky' activities to improve lifestyle, professor says - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2015-11-22 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[disability |disabled]] people,&lt;ref name=Coda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codasouth.org/807-2/ |title=Duty of Care and Dignity of Risk - Coda South - Choice.

== History ==
The concept was first articulated in a 1972 article ''The dignity of risk and the mentally retarded'' by Robert Perske:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Overprotection may appear on the surface to be kind, but it can be really evil. An oversupply can smother people emotionally, squeeze the life out of their hopes and expectations, and strip them of their dignity. Overprotection can keep people from becoming all they could become. Many of our best achievements came the hard way: We took risks, fell flat, suffered, picked ourselves up, and tried again. Sometimes we made it and sometimes we did not. Even so, we were given the chance to try. Persons with special needs need these chances, too. Of course, we are talking about prudent risks. People should not be expected to blindly face challenges that, without a doubt, will explode in their faces. Knowing which chances are prudent and which are not – this is a new skill that needs to be acquired. On the other hand, a risk is really only when it is not known beforehand whether a person can succeed. The real world is not always safe, secure, and predictable, it does not always say “please,” “excuse me”, or “I’m sorry”. Every day we face the possibility of being thrown into situations where we will have to risk everything … In the past, we found clever ways to build avoidance of risk into the lives of persons living with disabilities. Now we must work equally hard to help find the proper amount of risk these people have the right to take. We have learned that there can be healthy development in risk taking and there can be crippling indignity in safety!&lt;ref name=Perske&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perske|first1=R|title=The dignity of risk and the mentally retarded.|journal=Mental retardation|date=February 1972|volume=10|issue=1|pages=24–7|pmid=5059995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conflict with duty of care==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Allowing people under care to take risks is often perceived to be in conflict with the caregivers' [[duty of care]]. Finding a balance between these competing considerations can be difficult when formulating policies and guidelines for caregiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interchangewa.org.au/opinion/duty-care-dignity-risk/ |title=Duty of care and the dignity of risk &amp;#124; Interchange |publisher=Interchangewa.org.au |date=2016-05-04 |author=Wendel Bamford |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coda/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perske/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianageingagenda.com.au/2016/05/11/balancing-act-dignity-risk-vs-duty-care/ |author=Jackie Keast |title=A balancing act: dignity of risk vs. duty of care |publisher=Australian Ageing Agenda |date=2016-05-11 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ibrahim|first1=Joseph E|last2=Davis|first2=Marie-Claire|title=Impediments to applying the ‘dignity of risk’ principle in residential aged care services|journal=Australasian Journal on Ageing|date=September 2013|volume=32|issue=3|pages=188–193|doi=10.1111/ajag.12014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems of overprotection==
[[File:Wheelchair rugby game 2.jpg|thumb|[[Wheelchair rugby]] is a [[contact sport|full contact sport]] played by wheelchair users. In spite of the protective features of the wheelchairs, the risk of injury is significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauerfeind|first1=Joanna|last2=Koper|first2=Magdalena|last3=Wieczorek|first3=Jacek|last4=Urbański|first4=Piotr|last5=Tasiemski|first5=Tomasz|title=Sports Injuries in Wheelchair Rugby – A Pilot Study|journal=Journal of Human Kinetics|date=1 January 2015|volume=48|issue=1|doi=10.1515/hukin-2015-0098}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Overprotection of people with disabilities causes low [[self-esteem]] and underachievement because of lowered expectations that come with overprotection. Internalisation of low expectations causes the disabled person to believe that they are less capable than others in similar situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanders|first1=KY|title=Overprotection and lowered expectations of persons with disabilities: the unforeseen consequences.|journal=Work (Reading, Mass.)|date=2006|volume=27|issue=2|pages=181–8|pmid=16971765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In elderly people, overprotection can result in learned dependency and a decreased ability for [[self-care]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennie|first1=David C.|title=Preventive care for elderly people|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, Angleterre|isbn=9780521436298|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is possible to deliver physical care that has positive outcomes and returns a person to full function, yet, if during that care they have not been involved, allowed to make choices and respectfully assisted with activities of daily living, it may be possible to cause psychological damage through undermining that person's dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenton|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Mitchell|first2=Theresa|title=growing old with dignity: a concept analysis|journal=Nursing Older People|date=June 2002|volume=14|issue=4|pages=19–21|doi=10.7748/nop2002.06.14.4.19.c2212|pmid=12094515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independent living ==
The right to fail and the dignity of risk is one of the basic tenets of the philosophy of the [[independent living|independent living movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deegan|first1=Patricia E.|title=The Independent Living Movement and people with psychiatric disabilities: Taking back control over our own lives.|journal=Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal|date=1992|volume=15|issue=3|pages=3–19|doi=10.1037/h0095769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ==
The first of eight "guiding principles" of the United Nations' [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] states: "Respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy including the freedom to make one’s own choices, and independence of persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guiding Principles of the Convention |publisher=United Nations - Division for Social Policy and Development |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/guiding-principles-of-the-convention.html|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several individuals have been described as the '''father of medicare''' in [[Canada]]. [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] is the country's publicly funded health system.

*[[Tommy Douglas]] forwarded{{clarify|the word makes no sense. something else is presumably intended|date=March 2018}} public health insurance as [[Premier of Saskatchewan]] from 1944 to 1961 and federal leader of the [[New Democratic Party]] from 1961 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://healthcoalition.ca/main/resources/tommy-douglas-the-father-of-medicare/ | title=Tommy Douglas: The Father of Medicare | publisher=Canadian Health Coalition | year=2012 | accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Woodrow Lloyd]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} was the Premier of Saskatchewan when universal medicare was introduced in Saskatchewan.
*[[Lester B. Pearson]] was the [[Liberal party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Canada]] from 1963 to 1968. His government saw medicare introduced on a national basis, after his party wrote and introduced the legislation for hospital and out-of-hospital treatment, and received the support of Douglas' NDP.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
*[[Emmett Matthew Hall]] was a jurist and chair of the 1964 [[Royal Commission]] on health care in Canada which recommended the nationwide adoption of [[Saskatchewan]]'s system of public insurance for both hospitalization and out-of-hospital medical services. In 1996, Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] stated that "Canadians will be forever grateful for the pivotal role that [Hall] played in bringing universal medicare to Canada. Throughout his long life, he remained medicare's most eloquent defender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.canada-heros.com/hall_emmett.html | title=Emmett Hall - Canadian Father of Medicare | work=Canada-Heros | date=February 18, 2011 | accessdate=August 12, 2012 | author=Jones, Don}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Paul Joseph James Martin]], [[Minister of National Health and Welfare (Canada)|Minister of National Health and Welfare]] from 1946 to 1957, played a central early role in the adoption of hospital insurance and is also remembered as a father of Medicare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/defining-ideas/article/80786 |title=Northern Exposure |author=Henderson, David R. |journal=Defining Ideas |date=June 2011 |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |publisher=Hoover Institution at Stanford University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814175659/http://www.hoover.org/publications/defining-ideas/article/80786 |archivedate=August 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list includes individuals from three major distinct and competing Canadian political traditions: Douglas and Lloyd from the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]], later the [[New Democratic Party]]; Hall, a [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]]; and Martin and Pearson, [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49508">'''GATA2 deficiency''' (also termed '''GATA2 haploinsufficiency''' or '''GATA2 deficiency syndrome''') is a recently defined grouping of several disorders caused by common defect, viz., familial or sporadic [[Mutation#By effect on function|inactivating mutation]]s in one of the two parental ''[[GATA2]]'' [[gene]]s. These [[autosomal dominant]] mutations cause a reduction, i.e. a [[haploinsufficiency]], in the cellular levels of the gene's product, [[GATA2]]. The GATA2 [[protein]] is a [[transcription factor]] critical for the [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]], maintenance, and functionality of [[blood|blood-forming]], [[Lymphatic system|lympathic-forming]], and other tissue-forming [[stem cell]]s. In consequence of these mutations, cellular levels of GATA2 are deficient and individuals develop over time hematological, immunological, lymphatic, or other presentations that may begin as apparently benign abnormalities but commonly progress to severe organ (e.g. lung) failure, [[opportunistic infection]]s, virus infection-induced cancers, the [[myelodysplastic syndrome]], and/or [[leukemia]]. GATA2 deficiency is a life-threatening and [[precancerous condition]].&lt;ref name="pmid28179280"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crispino JD, Horwitz MS |title=GATA factor mutations in hematologic disease |journal=Blood |volume=129 |issue=15 |pages=2103–2110 |date=April 2017 |pmid=28179280 |pmc=5391620 |doi=10.1182/blood-2016-09-687889}}

The various presentations of GATA2 deficiency include: '''1)''' [[MonoMAC|Monocytopenia and Mycobacterium Avium Complex/Dendritic Cell, Monocyte, B and NK Lymphocyte deficiency]] (i.e. MonoMAC or MonoMAC/DCML); '''2)''' [[Emberger syndrome]]; '''3)''' familial [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]/[[acute myeloid leukemia]] (i.e. familial MDS/AML); '''3)''' [[chronic myelomonocytic leukemia]] (i.e. CMML);  and '''4)''' other anomalies such as [[aplastic anemia]], chronic [[neutropenia]], and wide-ranging [[Immunodeficiency|immunological defects]].&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt; Each of these presentations is characterized by a specific constellation of signs and symptoms but often includes signs and symptoms more characteristic of other GATA2 deficiency presentations. Furthermore, individuals with identical ''GATA2'' gene mutations can exhibit very different presentations.&lt;ref name="pmid28179280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27248996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bannon SA, DiNardo CD | title = Hereditary Predispositions to Myelodysplastic Syndrome | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 838| date = May 2016 | pmid = 27248996 | pmc = 4926372 | doi = 10.3390/ijms17060838 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24467820"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = West AH, Godley LA, Churpek JE | title = Familial myelodysplastic syndrome/acute leukemia syndromes: a review and utility for translational investigations | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1310 | issue = | pages = 111–8 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24467820 | pmc = 3961519 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12346 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2011, MonoMAC and the Emberger syndrome were clinically defined as unrelated [[genetic disorders]]. In 2011, however, all cases of both disorders were found to be caused by inactivating mutations in the ''GATA2'' gene. Subsequently, some but not all cases of an expanding list of other well-defined disorders have been attributed to inactivating ''GATA2'' mutations.  While MonoMAC, the Emberger syndrome, and the growing list of all other disorders marked by inactivating ''GATA2'' gene mutations are now being classified as a single clinical entity termed GATA2 deficiency, MonoMAC and the Emberger syndrome are sometimes still regarded as separate clinical entities.&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt; Here, GATA2 deficiency is taken to include all disorders caused by inactivating ''GATA2'' mutations. Defined as such, GATA2 deficiency is an unexpectedly common underlying cause for a growing list of disorders. Importantly, however, its treatment differs critically from that used to treat cases of these disorders which are not due to GATA2 deficiency.&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;

=== ''GATA2'' gene mutations ===
Inactivating mutations in the ''GATA2'' gene are the primary cause of GATA2 deficiency disorders. This gene is a member of the evolutionarily conserved [[GATA transcription factor]] gene family. All [[vertebrate]] species tested so far, including humans and mice, express 6 GATA genes, ''GATA1'' through ''GATA6''.&lt;ref name="pmid23048181"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chlon TM, Crispino JD | title = Combinatorial regulation of tissue specification by GATA and FOG factors | journal = Development | volume = 139 | issue = 21 | pages = 3905–16 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23048181 | pmc = 3472596 | doi = 10.1242/dev.080440 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ''GATA2'' gene is located on the long (or "q") arm of [[chromosome 3]] at position 21.3 (i.e. the 3q21.3 locus). It consists of 8 [[exons]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624&lt;/ref&gt; Two sites, one more toward the [[Directionality (molecular biology)#5' end|5' end]], the second more toward the [[Directionality (molecular biology)#3' end|3' end]] of the gene code for two [[Zinc finger]] [[structural motif]]s, ZF1 and ZF2, respectively, of the GATA2 transcription factor.

The ''GATA2'' gene has at least five separate sites which bind nuclear factors that regulate its expression. One particularly important such site is located in [[intron]] 4. This site, termed the 9.5 kb enhancer, is located 9.5 [[Base pair#Length measurements|kilobases]] (i.e. kb) down-stream from the gene's [[Gene#Structure|transcript initiation site]] and is a critically important [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] of the gene's expression.&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt; Regulation of ''GATA2'' expression is highly complex. For example, in hematological stem cells, GATA2 transcription factor itself binds to one of these sites and in doing so is part of functionally important [[positive feedback]] [[autoregulation|autoregulation circuit]] wherein the transcription factor acts to promote its own production; in a second example of a positive feed back circuit, GATA2 stimulates production of [[Interleukin 1 beta]] and [[CXCL2]] which act indirectly to simulate ''GATA2'' expression. In an example of a [[negative feedback]] circuit, the GATA2 transcription factor indirectly causes activation of the [[G protein coupled receptor]], [[GPR65]], which then acts, also indirectly, to repress ''GATA2'' gene expression.&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28179282"/&gt; In a second example of negative feed-back, GATA2 transcription factor stimulates the expression of the [[GATA1]] transcription factor which in turn can displace GATA2 transcription factor from its gene-stimulating binding sites thereby limiting GATA2's actions (see GATA2 switch in "GATA2 transcription factor" section).&lt;ref name="pmid27235756"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shimizu R, Yamamoto M | title = GATA-related hematologic disorders | journal = Experimental Hematology | volume = 44 | issue = 8 | pages = 696–705 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27235756 | doi = 10.1016/j.exphem.2016.05.010 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human ''GATA2'' gene is [[Gene expression|expressed]] in hematological bone marrow cells at the [[stem cell]] and later [[progenitor cell]] stages of their [[Cellular differentiation|development]]. Increases and/or decreases in the gene's expression regulate the [[Stem cell#self-renewal|self-renewal]], survival, and progression of these immature cells toward their final mature forms viz., [[erythrocytes]]s, certain types of [[lymphocyte]]s (i.e. [[B cells]], [[NK cells]], and [[T helper cells]]), [[monocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[platelet]]s, [[plasmacytoid dendritic cells]], [[macrophages]] and mast cells.&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24227816"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid29452225"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bigley V, Cytlak U, Collin M | title = Human dendritic cell immunodeficiencies | journal = Seminars in Cell &amp; Developmental Biology | volume = | issue = | pages = | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29452225 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2018.02.020 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene is likewise critical for the formation of the [[lymphatic system]], particularly for the development of its valves.

Scores of different types of inactivating ''GATA'' mutations have been associated with GATA2 deficiency; these include [[Frameshift mutation|frameshift]], [[point mutation|point]], [[Insertion (genetics)|insertion]], [[Splice site mutation|splice site]] and [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion]] mutations scattered throughout the gene but concentrated in the region encoding the GATA2 transcription factor's ZF1, ZF2, and 9.5 kb sites. Rare cases of GATA2 deficiency involve large mutational deletions that include the 3q21.3 locus plus contiguous adjacent genes; these mutations seem more likely than other types of ''GATA'' mutations to cause increased susceptibilities to viral infections, developmental lymphatic disorders, and neurological disturbances.&lt;ref name="pmid28179280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24227816"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spinner MA, Sanchez LA, Hsu AP, Shaw PA, Zerbe CS, Calvo KR, Arthur DC, Gu W, Gould CM, Brewer CC, Cowen EW, Freeman AF, Olivier KN, Uzel G, Zelazny AM, Daub JR, Spalding CD, Claypool RJ, Giri NK, Alter BP, Mace EM, Orange JS, Cuellar-Rodriguez J, Hickstein DD, Holland SM | title = GATA2 deficiency: a protean disorder of hematopoiesis, lymphatics, and immunity | journal = Blood | volume = 123 | issue = 6 | pages = 809–21 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24227816 | pmc = 3916876 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2013-07-515528 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-mutational GATA2 deficiency ===

=== Other genetic abnormalities ===
GATA2 deficiency disorders are variably associated with secondary genetic abnormalities. [[Monosomy]] of [[chromosome 7]] (i.e. lose of one of the two chromosomes 7) or deletion of the "q" (i.e. short arm) of one chromosome 7 are the most common abnormal [[karyotype]]s (i.e. abnormal chromosome number or appearance) associated with GATA2 deficiency, occurring in ~41% of cases; less common abnormal karyotypes associated with the deficiency include chromosome 8 [[trisomy]] (8% of cases) and, rarely, chromosome 21 monosomy.&lt;ref name="pmid28179280"/&gt; GATA2 deficiency is also associated with [[Mutations#somatic mutations|somatic mutaions]] in at least three other genes viz.,  ''[[ASXL1]]'', ''[[SETBP1]]'', and ''[[STAG2]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt; Independently of ''[[GATA2]]'' mutations and the development of GATA2 deficiency, ''ASXL1'' mutations are associated with MDS, AML, CMML, [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], [[myeloproliferative neoplasm]], and cancers of the breast, cervix, and liver,&lt;ref name="pmid23736028"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katoh M |title=Functional and cancer genomics of ASXL family members |journal=British Journal of Cancer |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=299–306 |date=July 2013 |pmid=23736028 |pmc=3721406 |doi=10.1038/bjc.2013.281 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SETBP1'' mutations are associated with atypical MDS, CMML, [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]], and [[chronic neutrophilic leukemia]],&lt;ref name="pmid28179280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26017341"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang L, Du F, Zhang HM, Wang HX | title = Evaluation of a father and son with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia with SETBP1 mutations and a review of the literature | journal = Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research = Revista Brasileira De Pesquisas Medicas E Biologicas | volume = 48 | issue = 7 | pages = 583–7 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26017341 | pmc = 4512095 | doi = 10.1590/1414-431X20154557 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''STAG2'' mutations are associated with MDS, AML, CMML, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and cancers of the bladder, stomach, colon, rectum, and prostate gland.&lt;ref name="pmid29278534"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Viny AD, Levine RL | title = Cohesin mutations in myeloid malignancies made simple | journal = Current Opinion in Hematology | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 61–66 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29278534 | doi = 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000405 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The roles, if any, of these karyotypes and somatic mutations on the development, types of presentation, and progression of GATA2 deficiency are unclear and require further study.&lt;ref name="pmid28179280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt;

== GATA2 transcription factor ==
The GATA2 transcription factor contains two [[zinc finger]] (i.e. ZnF) [[Structural motif|motif]]s. C-ZnF is located toward the protein's [[C-terminus]] and is responsible for binding to specific [[DNA]] sites. N-ZnF is located toward the proteins [[N-terminus]] and is responsible for interacting with various other [[Cell nucleus#Cell compartmentalization|nuclear proteins]] that regulate its activity. The transcription factor also contains two [[transactivation domain]]s and one negative regulatory domain which interact with nuclear proteins to up-regulate and down-regulate, respectively, its activity.&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt; In promoting [[haematopoiesis]] (i.e. maturation of hematological and immunological cells), GATA2 interacts with other [[transcription factors]] (viz., [[RUNX1]], [[TAL1|SCL/TAL1]], [[GFI1]], [[Cripto|GFI1b]], [[MYB (gene)|MYB]], [[IKZF1]], [[SPI1|Transcription factor PU.1]], [[LYL1]])  and cellular receptors (viz., [[MPL (gene)|MPL]], [[GPR56]]).&lt;ref name="pmid28179282"/&gt;

GATA2 binds to a specific [[nucleic acid sequence]]  viz., (T/A(GATA)A/G), on the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] and [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] sites of its target genes and in doing so either stimulates or suppresses the expression of these target genes. However, there are thousands of sites in human DNA with this nucleotide sequence but, for unknown reasons, GATA2 binds to &lt;1% of these. Furthermore, all members of the GATA transcription factor family bind to this same nucleotide sequence and in doing so may in certain instances serve to interfere with GATA2 binding or even displace the GATA2 that is already bound to these sites. For example, displacement of GATA2 bond to this sequence by the [[GATA1]] transcription factor appears important for the normal development of some types of hematological stem cells. This displacement phenomenon is termed the "GATA switch". In all events, the actions of GATA2 in regulating its target genes is extremely complex and not fully understood.&lt;ref name="pmid28179280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28179282"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27235756"/&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
The age of onset of the GATA2 deficiency is variable with rare individuals showing first signs or symptoms in their infancy and others showing first symptoms or signs at almost any time thereafter including their later years. Rare individuals with inactivating GATA2 mutations may never develop symptoms, i.e. the disorder has a very high but nonetheless incomplete degree of [[penetrance]].&lt;ref name="pmid21892158"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24227816"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20803646"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mansour S, Connell F, Steward C, Ostergaard P, Brice G, Smithson S, Lunt P, Jeffery S, Dokal I, Vulliamy T, Gibson B, Hodgson S, Cottrell S, Kiely L, Tinworth L, Kalidas K, Mufti G, Cornish J, Keenan R, Mortimer P, Murday V | title = Emberger syndrome-primary lymphedema with myelodysplasia: report of seven new cases | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics.

== Pathophysiology ==
=== Hematologic defects ===
Deletion of both ''Gata2'' genes in mice is lethal by day 10 of embryogenesis due to a total failure in the [[hematopoiesis|formation of mature blood cells]]. Inactivation of one mouse ''Gata2'' gene is neither lethal nor associated with most of the signs of human GATA2 deficiency; however, these animals do show a ~50% reduction in their [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s along with a reduced ability to repopulate the bone marrow of mouse recipients. The latter findings, human clinical studies, and experiments on human tissues support the conclusion that in humans both parental ''GATA2'' genes are required for sufficient numbers of hematopoietic stem cells to emerge from the [[hemogenic endothelium]] during [[embryogenesis]] and for these cells and subsequent [[progenitor cells]] to survive, [[Stem cell#self-renewal|self-renew]], and  [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into mature cells.&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24227816"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25397911"/&gt; As GATA2 deficient individuals age, their deficiency in hematopoietic stem cells worsens, probably as a result of factors such as infections or other stresses. In consequence, the signs and symptoms of their disease appear and/or become progressively more severe.&lt;ref name="pmid25619630"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mir MA, Kochuparambil ST, Abraham RS, Rodriguez V, Howard M, Hsu AP, Jackson AE, Holland SM, Patnaik MM | title = Spectrum of myeloid neoplasms and immune deficiency associated with germline GATA2 mutations | journal = Cancer Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 490–9 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25619630 | pmc = 4402062 | doi = 10.1002/cam4.384 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MonoMAC-afflicted individuals exhibit reduced levels of [[Lymphopoiesis#Stages of development|common lymphoid progenitor cells]] (i.e. a heterogenous group of precursors to various [[lymphocyte]] types) and [[granulocyte-macrophage progenitor]] cells (i.e. precursors to [[granulocytes]] and [[monocytes]]).&lt;ref name="pmid21242295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bigley V, Haniffa M, Doulatov S, Wang XN, Dickinson R, McGovern N, Jardine L, Pagan S, Dimmick I, Chua I, Wallis J, Lordan J, Morgan C, Kumararatne DS, Doffinger R, van der Burg M, van Dongen J, Cant A, Dick JE, Hambleton S, Collin M | title = The human syndrome of dendritic cell, monocyte, B and NK lymphoid deficiency | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 208 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–34 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21242295 | pmc = 3039861 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20101459 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mice and presumably humans, GATA2 deficiency also leads to reduced levels of early [[erythrocyte]] stem cells.&lt;ref name="pmid24638828"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moriguchi T, Yamamoto M | title = A regulatory network governing Gata1 and Gata2 gene transcription orchestrates erythroid lineage differentiation | journal = International Journal of Hematology | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 417–24 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 24638828 | doi = 10.1007/s12185-014-1568-0 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While our understanding of human hematopoiesis is incomplete, it is proposed that these or related progenitor cell reductions causes a progressively worsening depletion of circulating and/or tissue bound [[B cells]], [[NK cells]], [[T helper cells]], [[monocytes]], [[plasmacytoid dendritic cells]],  [[neutrophils]], and/or [[red blood cells]].

=== Immunologic defects ===   
The depletion of hematologic cells, particularly [[dendritic cells]], caused by GATA2 deficiency (see previous section) also appears responsible for the development of defective [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune responses. In consequence, these individuals become increasing susceptibility to infectious agents and to cancers caused by infective agents. This defect in mounting immune responses is mostly restricted to new antigenic challenges. That is, [[Immune response|secondary immune responses]] to which individuals had mounted effective [[Immune responses|primary immune responses]] before GATA2 deficiency paralyzed their immune system generally remain intact. Immune system deterioration would also appear responsible for the development of the pathological [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune reactions]] which afflicted individuals may mount against their own tissues.&lt;ref name="pmid28179282"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24227816"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid29452225"/&gt;

=== Lymphedema ===
The GATA2 transcription factor contributes to controlling the expression of two genes, ''[[PROX1]]'' and ''[[FOXC2]]'', which are required for the proper development of the lymphathic system, particularly lymph vessel valves. It is proposed that GATA2 deficiency causes a failure to develop competent valves and/or vessels in the [[lymphatic system]] and thereby leads to [[lymphedema]].&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;

=== Hearing loss ===
GATA2 deficiency-induced abnormalities in the lymphatic system are also proposed to be responsible for a failure in generating the [[perilymphatic space]] around the inner ear's [[semicircular canals]], which in turn underlies the development of sensorineural hearing loss in GATA2 deficient individuals, particularly those diagnosed with the Emberger syndrome.&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;

=== Other defects ===
The pathophysiology behind the other defects associated with GATA2 deficiency such as hypothyroidism, endocarditis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; cryptogenic organizing pneumonia-like disease, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary ventilator and diffusion defects, miscarriages, etc., is as yet undefined. It is possible that many of these other defects are secondary, i.e. associated with GATA2 deficiency but not a direct result of low cellular levels of the GATA2 transcription factor.

== Presentations ==
The presentations of GATA2 deficiency commonly fall into various categories with MonoMAC and Emberger syndrome in the past and sometimes even currently being considered as separate entities. In most cases, the age of onset and initial signs and symptoms are variable with each presentation often being accompanied by signs or symptoms more typical of other presentations. Nonetheless, most cases of the deficiency exhibit a combination of signs and symptoms that fit the following presentations.

=== MonoMAC ===
{{main|MonoMAC}}
Individuals afflicted with MonoMAC commonly present in early adulthood afflicted with one or more of the [[opportunistic infection]]s listed in the above Signs and symptoms section and have profoundly low numbers of circulating [[monocyte]]s which may have existed for many years before symptoms developed.&lt;ref name="pmid23728141"/&gt; These individuals also have low numbers of two other types of circulating blood cells viz., [[B lymphocyte]]s and [[NK cell]]s. Other presentations and/or developments (see Signs and symptoms)include: '''1)''' pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; '''2)''' tumors caused by opportunistic viral infections; '''3)''' autoimmunity disturbances; and '''4)''' the myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloblastic leukemia, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.&lt;ref name="pmid23728141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25739845"/&gt;

=== Emberger Syndrome ===     
{{main|Emberger syndrome}}
Emberger syndrome presents as early as infancy but more typically in childhood or early adulthood with [[lymphedema]] of the lower limbs or [[testes]], i.e. [[hydrocele]], and congenital [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. Afflicted individuals may also exhibit one or more of the [[dysplasia]]s listed in the above "Signs and symptoms" section. These presentations typically occur along side of or are followed by hematalogic abnormalities including but often only after many years or decades seriously life-threatening [[myelodysplastic syndrome]] and/or [[acute myeloid leukemia]].&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21892158"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20803646"/&gt; Individuals afflicted by the syndrome may also exhibit increased susceptibility to opportunistic viral infections, particularly in individuals that have [[Null allele|Null mutations]] (i.e. mutations that cause complete lose of a functional gene product) in the ''GATA2'' gene.&lt;ref name="pmid25619630"/&gt;

=== Familial MDS/AML ===
{{main|Myelodysplastic syndrome}}
Familial MDS/AML is an inherited predisposition to develop MDS, i.e. a disorder characterized by the development of a genetically distinct subpopulation (i.e. clone) of bone marrow [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s,  decreased levels of one or more types of circulating blood cells, and an increased risk of progressing to leukemia, particularly AML.&lt;ref name="pmid29438960"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Locatelli F, Strahm B | title = How I treat myelodysplastic syndromes of childhood | journal = Blood | volume = 131 | issue = 13 | pages = 1406–1414 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29438960 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2017-09-765214 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; GATA2 deficiency commonly presents as MDS in childhood (usually &gt;4 years of age) and adolescent (generally &lt;18 years of age) individuals and as such is the most common [[germline mutation]] responsible for familial MDS/AML in this age group.&lt;ref name="pmid27913534"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hasle H | title = Myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorders of childhood | journal = Hematology.

=== Congenital neutropenia ===
{{main|Neutropenia}}
Congenital neutropenia refers to an assorted group of diseases that share a common set of signs and symptoms, viz., [[neutropenia]], i.e. a low circulating blood [[neutrophil]] count, increased susceptibility to infections, various organ dysfunctions, and an extraordinarily high risk of developing leukemia.&lt;ref name="pmid28875503"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Donadieu J, Beaupain B, Fenneteau O, Bellanné-Chantelot C | title = Congenital neutropenia in the era of genomics: classification, diagnosis, and natural history | journal = British Journal of Haematology | volume = 179 | issue = 4 | pages = 557–574 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28875503 | doi = 10.1111/bjh.14887 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small percentage of individuals with familial or sporadic GATA2 deficiency present in their childhood with [[asymptomatic]] mild neutropenia but no other discernible hematological abnormalities except perhaps [[monocytopenia]] and [[macrocytosis]], i.e. enlarged [[red blood cell]]s. This presentation often persists for years but commonly progresses to include [[thrombocytopenia]], increases susceptibility to infections due to, e.g. atypical mycobacteria or [[Human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]], dysfunction of non-hematological organs, MDS, and leukemia (primarily AML and less commonly CMML). It is estimated that by age 30, 60% of these individuals develop leukemia.&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24467820"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25619630"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28875503"/&gt; Some of these individuals have large deletion mutations that span the ''GATA2'' along with nearby genes and exhibit in addition to hematological defects various developmental abnormalities, neurological abnormalities, and/or body dysmorphic disorders.&lt;ref name="pmid29296959"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fisher KE, Hsu AP, Williams CL, Sayeed H, Merritt BY, Elghetany MT, Holland SM, Bertuch AA, Gramatges MM | title = Somatic mutations in children with GATA2-associated myelodysplastic syndrome who lack other features of GATA2 deficiency | journal = Blood Advances | volume = 1 | issue = 7 | pages = 443–448 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 29296959 | pmc = 5738979 | doi = 10.1182/bloodadvances.2016002311 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other presentations ===
{{main|Aplastic anemia}}
{{main|Bone marrow failure}}
{{main|Humoral immune deficiency}}
{{main|Monocytosis}}
{{main|Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia}}
GATA2 deficiency has been diagnosed in up to 10% of individuals presenting with [[aplastic anemia]]. It is also the most common cause of hereditary [[bone marrow failure]] and may present with this disorder. GATA 2 deficiency has been diagnosed in rare cases presenting as [[humoral immune deficiency]] due to [[B cell]] depletion, severe [[Epstein–Barr virus infection]], or [[Epstein-Barr virus infection#EBV-associated malignancies|Epstein-Barr associated cancer]]s. In all of these presentations, individuals may have or develop other manifestations of the deficiency and are of particularly high risk for developing AML or CMML.&lt;ref name="pmid28179280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25397911"/&gt;

Rare cases of individuals with GATA2 deficiency may also present with extreme [[monocytosis]] (i.e. increases in circulating blood monocytes) or CMML, i.e. monocytosis plus the presence of abnormal ([[Precursor cell|blasts]]) in the circulation and/or bone marrow. GATA2 deficient individuals who develop CMML often exhibit mutations in one of their ''[[ASXL1]]'' genes. Since mutations in this gene are associated with  CMML independently of ''GATA2'' mutations, ''ASXL1'' mutations may promote the development of CMML in GATA2 deficiency.&lt;ref name="pmid28179280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25397911"/&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Individuals with GATA2 deficiency commonly exhibit abnormalities in their [[complete blood count|circulating blood cells]] (see above "Hematologic" section of Signs and symptoms) that may precede other signs and symptoms of the disease by years. Their [[bone marrow biopsy|bone marrows]] typically shows significant reductions in one or more types of blood cell lines (i.e. hypocellularity) with characteristic dysplastic features of increased sizes of cells in the red blood cell line (i.e. macrocytic erythropoiesis), small or enlarged [[megakaryocyte]]s, abnormalities in the maturation of cells in the granulocyte cell line, [[fibrosis]] consisting of [[reticular fibers]], increased numbers of [[T cells]] containing numerous large granules in their [[cytoplasm]], and in advanced cases increases in [[blast cell]] numbers. The bone marrow in advanced cases may also exhibit increase in cellularity, i.e. hypercellularity.&lt;ref name="pmid27913534"/&gt; GATA2 deficient individuals often have highly increased blood levels of [[FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand]]&lt;ref name="pmid25397911"/&gt; However, these as well as other features are diagnostic of a hematologic disorder but not necessarily of GATA2 deficiency. [[DNA sequencing]] of the full ''GATA2'' gene [[coding region]] including the [[intron]]4 enhancer by [[Sanger sequencing]] or [[High-throughput sequencing|high-throughput]] methods along with DNA [[copy number analysis]] and [[karyotyping]] should establish the presence of ''GATA2'' gene mutations; comparison of detected gene mutations to the list of inactivating GATA2 gene mutations plus the clinical presentation and family history are essentials in making the diagnosis of GATA2 deficiency.&lt;ref name="pmid21892158"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25659730"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Babushok DV, Bessler M | title = Genetic predisposition syndromes: when should they be considered in the work-up of MDS? | journal = Best Practice &amp; Research. Clinical Haematology | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–68 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25659730 | pmc = 4323616 | doi = 10.1016/j.beha.2014.11.004 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
The various interventions recommended for GATA2 deficiency fall into three categories: family counseling, prevention of the disease's many complications, and bone marrow transplantation in an effort to restore GATA2-sufficient stem cells. However, due to the uncommonness of, and only recent appreciation for, the disease, standard [[Clinical trial#Phases|phase 2 clinical trials]] to establish the efficacy of a drug(s), and/or non-drug treatment regiments against an appropriate [[placebo]] treatment regimen have not been reported.

=== Family counseling ===
Family members of an individual(s) diagnosed with an inactivating ''GATA2'' gene mutation should be told of their chances of having this mutation, advised of the consequences of this mutation, recommended to be tested for the mutation, warned that they are not suitable donors for any GATA2 deficient individual, and offered long term follow up of their mutation.&lt;ref name="pmid28179280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25397911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25659730"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid29189513"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rastogi N, Abraham RS, Chadha R, Thakkar D, Kohli S, Nivargi S, Prakash Yadav S | title = Successful Nonmyeloablative Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant in a Child With Emberger Syndrome and GATA2 Mutation | journal = Journal of Pediatric Hematology/oncology | volume = | issue = | pages = 1| date = November 2017 | pmid = 29189513 | doi = 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000995 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevention of complications === 
Recommendations for individuals exhibiting susceptibility to the infectious complications of GATA2 deficiency (e.g. MonoMAC-afflicted individuals) include: early vaccination for papillomavirus, early vaccination or prophylaxis drug treatment for nontuberculosus mycobacteria, and, perhaps, prophylaxis drug treatment (e.g. [[Azithromycin]]) for bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid25397911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27913495"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porter CC | title = Germ line mutations associated with leukemias | journal = Hematology.

=== Bone marrow transplantation ===
Many authorities currently recommend GATA2 deficiency be treated by a moderately but not maximally aggressive [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation#Conditioning regimens#Myeloablative|myeloablative]] conditioning regimen to remove native bone marrow stem/progenitor cells followed by [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] to repopulate the bone marrow with GATA2 sufficient stem cells.&lt;ref name="pmid28179280"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25397911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid29189513"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25659730"/&gt; The use of this procedure should be anticipatory and occur before the development of a hyperellular bone marrow or a bone marrow or blood populated by an excess of [[progenitor cells]] (i.e. blast cells &gt;2% to 5%). These developments are often followed by transformation of the disorder to a leukemia.&lt;ref name="pmid29438960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt; This regiment should also be performed before the development of severe systemic infections, tumors, or deterioration in lung function. disease. While it takes up to 3.5 years for this regiment to fully re-institute good immune function, it significantly reduces susceptibility to infections and infection-induced tumor formation.&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt; The regimen also improves or normalizes lung function in cases of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and pulmonary artery hypertension and may halt the progression or improve the function of other organs directly injured by GATA2 deficiency.&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25397911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25619630"/&gt;

==== Clinical trials ====
Many reports on the recommended treatment of GATA2 deficiency follow an NIH clinical trial termed "A Pilot and Feasibility Study of Reduced-Intensity Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant regimen for Patients With GATA2 Mutations". This trial used a regimen of drugs ([[cyclophosphamide]], [[fludarabine]]) and [[total body irradiation]] conditioning followed by [[allogenic]] hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant on 10 patients. The trial had 8 disease-free survivors and obtained an overall survival 76 months with a range of 18 to 95 months.&lt;ref&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT00923364?cond=GATA2+deficiency&amp;rank=3&amp;sect=X01256#all&lt;/ref&gt; An NIH intervention study is in the process of recruiting and treating 144 individuals with GATA2 deficiency to determine the success of a treatment regimen consisting of druga ([[fludarabine]], [[busulfan]], [[cyclophosphamide]]) and total body irradiation conditioning followed by allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&lt;ref&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01861106?term=NCT01861106&amp;rank=1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
[[Survival rate#Overall survival|Overall survival]] in a NIH study using a modest conditioning regimen (see previous section) followed by hematologic stem cell transplantation in GATA2 deficient patients afflicted with immune deficiencies was 54% at 4 years;  GATA2 deficient childrent transplanted for MDS with monosomy 7 experienced a 5 year survival of 68%.&lt;ref name="pmid28637621"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28643018"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3939">The '''Global Forum for Health Research''' is an international foundation headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] established in 1997 to increase the amount of research into global health issues. It coined the phrase [[10/90 gap]] to identify the observation that only 10% of the world's health research spending is targeted at 90% of present health problems.&lt;ref name="capdevila" /&gt;

The Global Forum is a partner to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/research_policy/en/|title=Research Policy|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her keynote address to the Forum in 1999 [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], then Director–General of WHO, declared that the Global Forum was key in the involvement of all the various levels, sectors and disciplines of "development agencies, the research community, health workers and end–users".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/1999/english/19990609_geneva_global_forum.html|title=Dr. G.H.

The Global Forum represents all the parties interested in health research: governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), United Nations agencies, research centers, universities, and the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref name="capdevila"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobalreport.org/issues/144/worldnews.html|title=World News - Profit alone motivates drug companies, say health activists|last=Capdevila|first=Gustavo|date=2001-10-09|publisher=Asheville Global Report|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inclen" /&gt; It is run by a governing council and provides support to programmes of research that benefit the developing world. It draws attention to global health research aims with an annual forum that draws together international health researchers and policy makers.

The Global Forums take place in a different international location each year: [[Geneva]], [[Bangkok]], [[Arusha]], [[Mexico City]], [[Mumbai]], [[Cairo]]. The 11th was in [[Beijing]] in 2007,&lt;ref name="xinhua"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-10/30/content_6975596.htm|title=Global Forum stresses {{sic|hea|thcare|nolink=yes}} for developing countries |date=2007-10-30|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 12th in [[Bamako]], [[Mali]] in 2008&lt;ref name="tembely"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maliweb.net/category.php?NID=38035&amp;intr=|title=Call for action to strengthen research for health , development and equity|last=Tembely|first=Ramata|date=2008-11-21|publisher=L'Independant|language=French|accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cuba]] hosted the 2009 Forum.&lt;ref name="tembely" /&gt;

==Obesity==
[[Obesity]] is a growing health concern in [[Kuwait]]. According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, Kuwait ranked 8 on a 2007 list of fattest countries with a percentage of 74.2% of Kuwait's total population with an unhealthy weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/07/worlds-fattest-countries-forbeslife-cx_ls_0208worldfat_2.html Forbes|title= World's Fattest Countries|accessdate=2009-02-12 |author= Lauren Streib|date= February 8, 2007|work= |publisher= Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the number of [[bariatric]] operations in Kuwait was 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.kuwaittimes.net/2012/11/08/kuwaitis-fight-fat-with-stomach-stapling-kuwait-becomes-one-of-the-worlds-fattest-countries/|title=Kuwaitis fight fat with stomach stapling – Kuwait becomes one of the world’s fattest countries|date=8 November 2012|publisher=Kuwait Times|accessdate=16 March 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130413194948/http://news.kuwaittimes.net/2012/11/08/kuwaitis-fight-fat-with-stomach-stapling-kuwait-becomes-one-of-the-worlds-fattest-countries/|archivedate=13 April 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1980 to 1993, the percentage of individuals age 18–29 that were overweight rose from 30.6% to 54.4% and the percentage of those who were overweight increased from 12.8% to 24.6%.&lt;ref name="A.N. Al-Isa"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Isa|first=A.N.|title=Obesity among Kuwaiti University Students: An Explorative Study|year=1999|pages=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of women who are either overweight or obese has jumped to 80% in 2010.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|first=FAO|title=Kuwait: Nutrition Country Profiles|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/AGN/nutrition/KWT_en.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book "Top 10 of Everything 2011", the women of Kuwait ranked 5th for the highest percentage of obesity.&lt;ref name="Ahmad Saeid"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saeid|first=Ahmad|title=Kuwaiti Women Place Fifth Worldwide in Obesity|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, it was determined that amongst children age 10–14, 30% of boys and 31.8% of girls were overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=IASO|title=Global Childhood Overweight|url=http://www.iaso.org/policy/.../global-trends-childhood-overweight|work=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Dasman Center for Research and Treatment of Diabetes, 15% of the adult population has diabetes, with 50% of adults over 45 living with the disease. 22 of every 100 children have developed diabetes as a result of an unhealthy weight.&lt;ref name="Velina Nacheva"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nacheva|first=Velina|title=Dasman Center Raises Nutrition Awareness|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased risk of excess weight or obesity is due to a combination of overeating energy-dense, high-fat foods and sedentary lifestyles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Meals consisting of processed ingredients with [[preservative]]s, [[saturated fat]]s, and [[hydrogenated oil]] are preferred over traditional foods. Advertisements for unhealthy junk food are seen everywhere and public schools sell candy, chocolate, and soda to their students.&lt;ref name="Hussain Al-Qatari"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Qatari|first=Hussain|title=Packing Obesity: A Peek into a Student's Lunch Box|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in Kuwaiti universities, other factors include eating between meals, marital status, and a male domination of sports.&lt;ref name="A.N. Al-Isa" /&gt;

==Smoking==
A smoking ban in public places was introduced by Law No 15 of 1995 but it is not strictly enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Up In Smoke|url=http://news.kuwaittimes.net/up-in-smoke/|accessdate=22 December 2015|publisher=Kuwait Times|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New regulations were introduced in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwait Bans Smoking in Malls and Public Indoors |url=http://kuwaitiful.com/news/kuwait-bans-smoking-in-malls-and-public-indoors/|accessdate=22 December 2015|publisher=Kuwaitiful|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking while driving is considered one of the major causes of accidents, so that the General Traffic Department is considering enforcing the law that bans motorists smoking inside their vehicles while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwait plans to enforce ban on smoking inside vehicles|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/kuwait-plans-enforce-ban-on-smoking-inside-vehicles--602036.html|accessdate=22 December 2015|publisher=Arabian Business|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hélio Viana de Freitas''' is a Brazilian businessman and CEO of World Sports Business and HBusiness Bank.

He was one of the principal authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veja Magazine (Portuguese) 08/11/2011|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/esporte/especialistas-apontam-falhas-no-futebol-negocio-brasileiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Brazil's [[Pelé Law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian Government - Publication of Law 9.615 (1998) (Portuguese)|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/L9615consol.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1998, which abolished the “pass” which tied professional players to clubs, made possible the creation of leagues, and defined the professionalization of soccer.  The Pelé Law also established the Consumer Law in Sports, obliged the accountability of managers, and created funding for [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Paralympic]] sports.  Viana also created the Indigenous Olympic Games and the Supportive Sport Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forum Bahia World Cup 2014 (Portuguese) |url=http://www.sjcdh.ba.gov.br/noticias/forum-discute-acessibilidade-para-a-copa-do-mundo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518041117/http://www.sjcdh.ba.gov.br/noticias/forum-discute-acessibilidade-para-a-copa-do-mundo |archivedate=2013-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a master's degree in Business Administration from [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]].
Viana was Vice President of the board of the Brazilian National Institute for the Development of Sports (INDESP - ''Instituto Nacional de Desenvolvimento do Desporto''), the precursor to today’s Ministry of Sports, from 1995 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian Government - Official Diary of the Union 12/04/1995 (Portuguese)|url=http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/diarios/1108001/dou-secao-2-12-04-1995-pg-7p}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The President was [[Pelé]], and other members included [[Carlos Arthur Nuzman]], [[Hortência Marcari]], Carlos Miguel Aidar, [[Nelson Piquet]], Rogério Amato, and Manuel Tubino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian Government - Official Diary of the Union 04/04/1996 (Portuguese)|url=http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/diarios/1101807/dou-secao-1-04-04-1996-pg-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viana designed the Pact of Soccer in 2001, which restructured Brazilian soccer, turning the national championship into consecutive points, and accompanied the organization of four [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s and three [[Olympic Games]].

The '''International Epidemiological Association''' ('''IEA''')  is a worldwide association with more than 2000 members in over 100 different countries, who follow the aims of the association to facilitate communication amongst those engaged in research and teaching of [[epidemiology]] throughout the world, and to encourage its use in all fields of health including social, community and preventative medicine.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;IEA. "International Epidemiological Association Council Handbook". 6th ed2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These aims are achieved by holding scientific meetings and seminars, by publication of journals, reports, translations of books, by contact amongst members and by other activities consistent with these aims. Members are accepted without regard to race, religion, sex, political affiliation or country of origin.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

The association publishes its own Journal, the ''[[International Journal of Epidemiology]]'' (IJE) [http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/], which is published bi-monthly, a complimentary copy of which is included in the membership dues.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;  It also sponsors a number of highly reputable publications such as ''A Dictionary of Epidemiology'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Miquel Porta]], editor. Greenland S, Hernán M, dos Santos Silva I, Last JM, associate editors (2014). "A dictionary of epidemiology", 6th. edition. New York: Oxford University Press. [http://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-dictionary-of-epidemiology-9780199976737?cc=us&amp;lang=en] {{ISBN|9780199976737}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Development of Modern Epidemiology'' [http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198569541.001.0001/acprof-9780198569541].&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; In addition, the association organizes The World Congress of Epidemiology (WCE) [http://www.epidemiology2014.com/] which is held triennially in different parts of the world.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; The 19th WCE [https://web.archive.org/web/20120827231541/http://www.epidemiology2011.com/] was held in Edinburgh, Scotland, August 2011,&lt;ref name="xix"&gt;IEA.

"20th IEA World Congress of Epidemiology".  2012 [cited 2012 09/13]; Available from: http://www.epidemiology2014.com/.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional Scientific Meetings are also held in the IEA regions during three-year periods between WCEs.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

The IEA is in official relations with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and is run by a council including executive and regional councilors for its 7 regions in addition to the ex-officio members.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

==Aims==

The objectives of the IEA are to:&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

* Promote the use of epidemiology and its application to the solution of health problems.
* Encourage the development of epidemiological methods and improvement in these methods.
* Promote the communication of epidemiological methods and findings amongst epidemiologists throughout the world as well as amongst all others concerned with health.
* Co-operate with both national and international organisations which are concerned with the promotion of health in the application of epidemiological methods in the solution of problems.
* Improve the dissemination of epidemiological findings nationally and internationally.
* Improve the recruitment, education and training of epidemiologists.

These objectives are achieved through networking professionals working in the field of epidemiology through different means, including its website: www.IEAweb.org [http://ieaweb.org/]; holding national, regional and international scientific meetings and congresses, as well as individual contacts between professional members. These have guided IEA's activities over the years.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

A determined effort was made in this decade to develop regional activities and to strengthen IEA links and co-operation with the [[WHO]].&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

==How it started==

The International Corresponding Club, as the IEA was first called, was started in 1954 by '''John Pemberton''' of Great Britain and '''Harold N Willard''' of the United States with the advice and help of [[Robert Cruickshank (bacteriologist)|Robert Cruickshank]]. They had found, as traveling Research Fellows each in the other's country, that they were handicapped by not being sufficiently well informed about the research and teaching in the field of social and preventive medicine in the various medical schools and research institutes. Initially it was to try and remedy this defect, that the Club was established on a small and informal basis. At first it was just a corresponding club whose object was ‘to facilitate the communication between physicians working for the most part in university departments of preventive and social medicine, or in research institutes devoted to these aspects of medicine, throughout the world’. This was to be achieved by the publication of a Bulletin twice a year and by members endeavouring to ‘ensure a friendly and hospitable welcome for visitors’ from other countries. The first issue of the Bulletin appeared in January 1955 and contained contributions from 26 correspondents from nine countries.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breslow"&gt;Breslow L. Origins and development of the International Epidemiological Association. International Journal of Epidemiology. 2005;34:725-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anonfirst"&gt;Anon. The first twenty years of the International Epidemiological Association 1954-74. International Journal of Epidemiology. 1974;3(4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anonhistory"&gt;Anon. The History of the International Epidemiological Association Brought Up to Date. International Epidemiological Association. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondents soon felt the need to meet to discuss research and teaching and the first formal meeting took place at the '''Ciba Foundation''' in London at the end of June 1956. By this time there were 49 correspondents from 18 countries, and one of them, '''A. Querido''' of Amsterdam invited the Club to hold its First International Scientific Meeting in the Netherlands. As a consequence a ‘Study Group on Current Epidemiological Research’, supported by a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], took place at Noordwijk in September 1957. There were 58 participants representing 44 university departments from 20 countries at this meeting. A constitution was formulated and the first executive committee was elected. The Noordwijk meeting was the first of the nineteenth international scientific meetings which have been held to date. The second was held in the [[University of Valle|Universidad del Valle]] in Cali, [[Colombia]] in 1959 when the present title of the association was adopted.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breslow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anonfirst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anonhistory"/&gt;

==The World Congress of Epidemiology (WCE)==

With few exceptions, the scientific meetings of the association have been held every three years since 1957 in different locations around the world. At the first Council Meeting held in Montreal 17–18 August 2002, it was agreed that all meetings formerly entitled '''International Scientific Meeting''' would henceforth be called '''World Congress of Epidemiology''' (WCE), with a continued sequence of numbering.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anonhistory"/&gt; Here is a list of the WCE held since 1957:&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

==The Educational work of the association==

The IEA has always attached great importance to the educational aspects of its work and its first Chairman, [[Robert Cruikshank]], often used the phrase ‘spreading the gospel’ to describe these aims.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anonfirst"/&gt;

The meeting in Cali in 1959 stimulated great interest in epidemiology in Colombia and as a result three seminars on epidemiology were later organized by the IEA in that country. This marked the beginning of a series of seminars in the South American continent and the Caribbean area.&lt;ref name="breslow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anonfirst"/&gt;

The [[Milbank Memorial Fund]] helped to make this extensive series of seminars possible and the [[WHO]], through the [[Pan American Health Organization]], also cooperated in these seminars. By 1977 the IEA had organized, or played a prominent part in, 23 Seminars or Workshops on epidemiology in 19 different countries. These were often conducted in association with the WHO. The association only undertakes to organize or participate in seminars at the invitation of the national or local educational or governmental bodies concerned.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

In 1969 a decision was taken to produce a guide on the teaching of epidemiology which would be suitable for use throughout the world. The WHO agreed to cooperate in this project and Dr '''Ronald Lowe''' and '''Jan  Kostrzewski''' were asked to edit the guide. It was published first in English as Epidemiology: A guide to Teaching Methods [http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199239481.001.0001/acprof-9780199239481] and also published in French, German, Polish, Serbo-Croat Slovak, and Spanish editions; and editions in Russian and Slovakare in preparation.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

Other of the classic texts sponsored by the IEA in collaboration with Oxford University Press is '''‘A Dictionary of Epidemiology’''' [https://web.archive.org/web/20121019021432/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/EpidemiologyBiostatistics/~~/dmlldz11c2EmY2k9OTc4MDE5NTMxNDUwMg==] which remains the definitive dictionary in epidemiology worldwide. In fact, with contributions from over 220 epidemiologists and other users of epidemiology from around the globe, it is more than a dictionary: it includes explanations and comments on both core epidemiologic terms and on other scientific terms relevant to all professionals in clinical medicine and public health, as well as to professionals in the other health, life, and social sciences. The aim of the IEA in cosponsoring this dictionary in its more than 20 years’ history has been to facilitate communication among epidemiologist to develop a "common language" to the extent that this is possible. The first fourth editions of the dictionary were edited by John Last and the fifth edition was edited by Miquel Porta. In addition, the IEA has produced a publication to commemorate its 50th anniversary called "History of Modern Epidemiology" in addition to supporting 3 editions of the important publication ''Teaching Epidemiology'' [http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199239481.001.0001/acprof-9780199239481].  The IEA offers a free copy of one of the first two publications as an incentive for life-time (10-years) or 3-year membership.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

The IEA also comments on current topical issues in epidemiology through a series of online "rapid response" commentaries [https://web.archive.org/web/20120922023619/http://ieaweb.org/epiblog-2/].&lt;ref name="epiblog"&gt;IEA. International Epidemiological Association: EpiBlog.  2012 [cited 2012 09/14]; Available from: {{cite web |url=http://ieaweb.org/epiblog-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922023619/http://ieaweb.org/epiblog-2/ |archivedate=2012-09-22 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The International Journal of Epidemiology (IJE)==

An important decision was taken at the Sixth International Meeting in 1971 to found an international quarterly journal of epidemiology. The council believed that the journal could replace the old Bulletin in providing a link between members in intervals between international meetings by publishing association news, and serve a valuable purpose by publishing original articles in the field of epidemiology. [[Walter W. Holland]] was appointed the first editor in 1972.  The IJE continues to go from strength to strength.  Between 2001 - 2016 under the editorship of [[George Davey Smith]] and Shah Ebrahim, the journal expanded.&lt;ref name="ije"&gt;International Journal of Epidemiology 2012 [cited 2012 09/14]; Available from: http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/ije/about.html.&lt;/ref&gt; They introduced a number of new features and the positive effects of these changes are reflected in its improved impact factor (7.2 in 2015), which places it first among the international epidemiology journals.&lt;ref name="ije"/&gt;  Six issues of the journal are published every year.

The association has a long tradition of collaboration with other organizations, particularly with the [[WHO]] and the [[Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences]] (CIOMS) [http://www.cioms.ch/] and International Clinical Epidemiologic Network (INCLEN) [http://www.inclen.org/].&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breslow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holland"&gt;Holland W, Detels R, Mosbech J. ''History of the IEA: 1984-1995''. International Epidemiological Association. 1997;26(1):228-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEA became affiliated with the CIOMS in 1955 and was represented on its executive committee. This affiliation led the association to the participation in preparing the international ethical guidelines for epidemiological studies, recognized by WHO as a key reference.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breslow"/&gt;

In 1966 the association was recognized by the WHO as a Non-Governmental Organization.  In addition to representation at the [[World Health Assembly]] and regional committees, this affiliation contributed to excellent working relationships with WHO in the planning and execution of educational programmes of the IEA and in the production of the "Guide to Teaching Epidemiology".&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breslow"/&gt;

The IEA is also an active member of the Countdown initiative, and provides oversight on data quality, analyses and interpretation. The Countdown to 2015: Maternal, Newborn and Child Health is a global initiative that includes academics and representatives of multilateral and bilateral agencies, professional organizations and civil society who share the common goal of increasing accountability for progress towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]] for improving the health of mothers and children.&lt;ref name="ieaweb"&gt;IEA. International Epidemiological Association.  2012 [cited 2012 09/13]; Available from: http://www.ieaweb.org/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The membership==

In the earlier years of the IEA, British and North American members were in the majority, mainly because the association had its origins in the UK and US. The council of the association has always been very conscious of this tendency and made active efforts to broaden the representativeness of the association by encouraging members to nominate epidemiologists from other countries.&lt;ref name="anonfirst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anonhistory"/&gt; Nowadays, membership is growing in the association, with over 2,000 current members from around the world. Current membership categories include:&lt;ref name="ieaweb"/&gt;

# Ordinary members (fully paid up members)
# Senior members (eligible for 50% discount of annual membership)
# Student members (eligible for 50% discount of annual membership)
# Joint members (with national epidemiological associations)
# Sponsored members
# Honorary members

The IEA has recently introduced a scheme of joint membership with various national epidemiological societies. Members of participating national societies join IEA at 30% of the usual rate and have all of the benefits of regular IEA membership, except that they receive the e-version of the IJE only. Joint membership have established with the following associations:&lt;ref name="ieaweb"/&gt;

==Regional activities==

The development and strengthening of regional activities is manifested by the record of the regional meetings.  These have been stimulating affairs as shown by the publications which resulted.  There have been regular meetings in most IEA Regions, including: Africa, South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, Latin America &amp; Caribbean, North America and Western Pacific and occasional ones in the remainder.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breslow"/&gt; Of particular note have been those which marked the foundation and strength of national epidemiological associations as in Japan, China and Holland.  The growth and interest in epidemiology and the enormous improvement in the quality, as well as the quantity of epidemiological research has been particularly notable in some IEA regions as South East Asia. For example, the Australian Regional IEA meeting in 1973 was attended by 9 Japanese - at that time the only such practicing scientists in that country.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt; There was, by 1995, a flourishing national association with more than 900 members and its own Journal published in English. It was the host for the 1996 '''International Scientific Meeting''' (ISM). The number of participants, at Regional Meetings in this area e.g. from China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand illustrate the increasing penetration of Epidemiology discipline.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

The growth and strengthening of Epidemiology discipline outside Western Europe and North America has also led to increase in bids to act as hosts for ISMs, now known as WCEs.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

Regional meetings are held in the years between the WCEs.

==International Training==

In effort of enforcing the capacity building role of IEA and moving the 20-year-old Florence course to the south, IEA has started an annual short-course in epidemiological methods. Indeed, the course is allied to the IEA-sponsored European Educational Programme in Epidemiology [https://web.archive.org/web/20120712190822/http://www.eepe.org/program.html], annually held in Florence for three weeks every June/July, under the directorship of '''Rodolfo Saracci''', for more than 2 decades. Thus, such course is intended as a "Florence South" course, run annually on a five-year cycle of the IEA regions outside of Europe and North America (South East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, Latin America and Western Pacific). Introductory, intermediate and advance level courses are offered to provide epidemiologists and public health professionals an opportunity to become acquainted with the advances in epidemiologic methods that can enhance the role of epidemiology in clinical medicine and public health.&lt;ref name="ieacourses"&gt;IEA. International Epidemiological Association: IEA Courses.  2012 [cited 2012 09/14]; Available from: http://www.iea-course.org/.&lt;/ref&gt;  These courses are addressed to epidemiologists, public health professionals, statisticians, and clinicians and include lectures, computer based analyses, exercises, discussion sessions, and practical experience in the design of a research proposal.&lt;ref name="ieacourses"/&gt; The first course was held in Jaipur, India, in April 2009, the second in Riyadh, [[Saudi Arabia]] in April, 2010, the third in [[Malawi]] in April 2011, while the latest was held in Lima, [[Peru]] during May 2012.  It is planned to have the upcoming course in Hangzhou, China, 2013 [http://www.iea-course.org/].&lt;ref name="ieacourses"/&gt;

The IEA also sponsors pre-conference courses prior to the WCE.

==Sir Richard Doll Prize==

In commemoration of Sir [[Richard Doll]], IEA established in 2007 the "Richard Doll Prize in Epidemiology" to be awarded on triennial basis. The prize is awarded to an epidemiologist of the highest scientific standard. The recipient is honored for his/her scientific achievements that have advanced our understanding of the determinants of a disease of importance for health in populations through a body of research that may involve a series of studies, rather than a single publication. The prize winner is selected by a committee which includes current IEA president, president-elect, past-president in addition to two members appointed by the IEA Council. The prize is presented at the triennial WCE as $30,000 and a special plaque. The first prize has been conferred in 2008 to Prof {{ill|Nubia Muñoz|de|}}, while the second was awarded to Prof David Barker in 2011.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ieaweb"/&gt;

==Early Career Epidemiologists (ECE)==

The IEA Executive Committee recently decided to create an International (worldwide) Early Career Epidemiologists group (ECE) within the IEA structure. A successful first meeting of ECE was held during the XIX IEA World Congress of Epidemiology (WCE) in Edinburgh (Scotland).&lt;ref name="xix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ieaweb"/&gt; The aims of this group are similar to those of the IEA, with a focus on identifying tools and opportunities to develop knowledge and careers for emerging professionals engaged in the field of epidemiology throughout the world. The IEA has decided to invest effort and resources in ensuring the connectivity among ECE and thus facilitate the promulgation of opportunities for IEA training events, a mentoring scheme, and other activities which promote the advance and appropriate use of the epidemiological methods and its development in all regions.&lt;ref name="ieaweb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ece"&gt;IEA. International Epidemiological Association: Early Career Epidemiologists (ECE).  2012 [cited 2012 09/14]; Available from: https://www.facebook.com/groups/263511860416050/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future==

The educational work of the IEA has always been regarded as one of its most important functions. This will continue through the media of the ''International Journal of Epidemiology'' and the International and Regional Scientific meetings. It is hoped that the IEA will be able to continue to play a part in the organization of seminars particularly in those parts of the world where epidemiology is not well developed. Owing to the lack of funds for this purpose such activities may have to be confined, for the present, to co-operation with national or international organizations, in particular the [[WHO]], by providing faculty members and resource material rather than funds.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breslow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anonfirst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="victora"&gt;Victora CG. The International Epidemiological Association: plans for the next triennium. Cad Saúde Pública. 2011;27(8):1456-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was general support for continued regional development at the Seventh International Meeting and the first steps were taken towards the organization of further regional meetings. The previous council recommended that regional IEA councils covering the WHO regions should be established in order to stimulate recruitment of members and the organization of international meetings within regions. The present council consists of members from all the WHO regions and it is now considering the whole question of regional development.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="breslow"/&gt;

'''Jacques Balmat''', called ''le Mont Blanc'' (1762–1834) was a [[mountaineering|mountaineer]], a [[Savoy]]ard [[mountain guide]], born in the [[Chamonix]] valley in [[Savoy]], at this time part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].

A [[chamois]] hunter and collector of [[quartz|crystals]], Balmat completed the [[first ascent]] of [[Mont Blanc]] with physician [[Michel-Gabriel Paccard]] on 8 August 1786.  For this feat, King [[Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus III]] gave him the honorary title ''le Mont Blanc''.

Balmat and Paccard's ascent of Mont Blanc was a major accomplishment in the early history of mountaineering.  C. Douglas Milner wrote "The ascent itself was magnificent; an amazing feat of endurance and sustained courage, carried through by these two men only, unroped and without ice axes, heavily burdened with scientific equipment and with long iron-pointed batons.  The fortunate weather and a moon alone ensured their return alive."{{sfnp|Milner|1955|p=16}}

[[Eric Shipton]] wrote "Theirs was an astounding achievement of courage and determination, one of the greatest in the annals of mountaineering.  It was accomplished by men who were not only on unexplored ground but on a route that all the guides believed to be impossible."{{sfnp|Shipton|1966|p=28}}

[[Gaston Rébuffat]] praised Balmat's climbing abilities, describing him as "This man, robust, resolute, this crystal hunter who, as it turns out, possesses an extraordinary mountaineering sense, an unerring instinct for the crevasses and [[serac]]s of the glaciers ..."{{sfnp|Rébuffat|1975|p=12}}

After the successful ascent, Balmat collected the reward offered 25 years before by [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] to the first man who could climb Mont Blanc. On 3 August 1787 he assisted de Saussure himself to reach the summit with a party of about 17 people.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Savoy fell under French control, and Citizen Jacques Balmat became a member of the council of the [[Communes of France|commune]].  He led an unsuccessful attempt to introduce [[Merino]] sheep into the Chamonix valley.{{sfnp|Milner|2015|p=28}}

Balmat was criticized for his autobiographical account of the climb, later published in English as ''Jacques Balmat, or The First Ascent of Mont Blanc'',{{sfnp|Oxley|2017}} since his account downplayed the role of Dr. Paccard. Milner describes Balmat's story as "cloudily romantic and largely fictional" and quotes four analysts of mountaineering history who discovered errors in Balmat's version of events.{{sfnp|Milner|1955|p=16}}

Shipton describes Balmat as "boastful and conceited" and that "in character, he was both vain and mean.  Success went to his head, and he soon began to amplify his part in the exploit."{{sfnp|Shipton|1966|pp=21–28}}

Balmat died by falling off a cliff while prospecting for gold in the [[Sixt-Fer-à-Cheval|Sixt]] valley in 1834.{{sfnp|Oxley|2017}}

'''Kenya Red Cross''' is one of the many [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] societies around the world. The [[Kenya]] organisation was established in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kenyaredcross.org/index.php/faqs | access-date = 14 December 2015 | publisher = Kenya Red Cross | title = FAQS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenya Red Cross supports and runs a number of projects whilst raising awareness to the Kenyan public about the current issues or problems which may affect them. Some of the projects which are either run by or assisted by the Kenya Red Cross are Famine, blood services, first aid projects, disaster and emergency services and education services.

The patron of the Kenya Red Cross is [[Uhuru Kenyatta]], [[President of Kenya]]. A council administers and performs a limited number of duties, and is made up of the Secretary General and twelve voting members. All other responsibilities are held by the Board which consists of 16 persons.

To supplement its humanitarian efforts, Kenya Red Cross launched a state-of-the art and first of its kind humanitarian app; the [http://www.krcsapp.com/ KRCS App] that offers users real-time emergency alerts and life-saving tips, activities, easy access to Membership and Volunteerism, events and training from Kenya Red Cross, job posts plus different groups such as blood groups, youth groups and volunteer groups where members can connect and share ideas.

== Interpretation ==
An abnormal Landau reflex may indicate [[hypotonia]] or [[hypertonia]] and may indicate a motor development issue.

'''Life Study'''  is a cross-disciplinary research study that will look at the health and wellbeing of thousands of children across the UK. It will collect a large amount of information on the health, growth and life factors of a new [[generation]] of children born in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2930109.ece "Womb-to-tomb study for 1 in 10 babies" The Times, March 2,2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  
This study will create a large storehouse of social, [[medical]] and environmental information and linked routine health data for use by UK [[academics]] and policy communities. The information in this storehouse resource will help answer questions regarding early life development of health and disease, and physical, [[psychological]] and social [[well-being]].

It is funded by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), [[ESRC|Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) and [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) academics from the Institute of Child Health's Paediatric Epidemiology Unit at [[University College London]] (UCL) are leading the study,&lt;ref&gt;MRC Centre of Epidemiology for Child Health
UCL Institute of Child Health [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ich/research-ich/mrc-cech/cohort-studies/uk-bcs Life Study]&lt;/ref&gt; with Professor Carol Dezateux the Director of the project.&lt;ref name=named&gt;"Life Study: The latest UK Birth Cohort Study is named" Tuesday, July 17, 2012][http://www.lifestudy.ac.uk/news/life-study-named UCL press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102213021/http://www.lifestudy.ac.uk/news/life-study-named |date=2013-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and objectives==

The study aims to understand how biological and environmental factors interact with a baby's early life experiences and the outcomes this has later in life. The study will cover five main research themes:

* Inequalities, [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] (including ethnic) and social changes in this new generation of UK children
* Early life factors of school readiness and later educational performance
* Development beginnings of health and illness in [[childhood]]
* Social, [[emotional]] and [[mental development]]: the interaction between the child and parent
* Neighbourhoods and the surrounding environment: effects on child and family

==Comparison with past UK cohort studies==
This will be the fifth UK birth cohort study (beginning in 1946) which have followed the lives of children from birth to adult life. As was the case with these earlier studies, Life Study will provide a wide range of new information into the health, growth and life factors of this new generation of UK children.

==Life study update==
The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) discontinued Research Councils’ funding for Life Study in early 2016 due to the challenges encountered in recruiting participants.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Malaria''' is a [[Mosquito-borne disease|mosquito-borne infectious disease]] affecting humans and other animals caused by [[parasitic]] [[protozoa|single-celled microorganism]]s belonging to the ''[[Plasmodium]]'' group.&lt;ref name="WHO2014" /&gt; Malaria causes [[symptoms]] that typically include [[fever]], [[fatigue (medical)|tiredness]], [[vomiting]], and [[headache]]s.&lt;ref name="Caraballo 2014"/&gt; In severe cases it can cause [[jaundice|yellow skin]], [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], [[coma]], or [[death]].&lt;ref name="Caraballo 2014"/&gt; Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected [[mosquito]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; In those who have recently survived an [[infection]], reinfection usually causes milder symptoms.&lt;ref name="Caraballo 2014"/&gt; This partial [[Immunity (medical)|resistance]] disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.&lt;ref name="Caraballo 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caraballo H |title=Emergency department management of mosquito-borne illness: Malaria, dengue, and west nile virus |journal=Emergency Medicine Practice |year=2014 |volume=16 |issue=5 |url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&amp;topic_id=405 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202316/http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&amp;topic_id=405 |archivedate=2016-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Cause and diagnosis--&gt;
The disease is most commonly transmitted by an infected female ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; The mosquito bite introduces the [[parasite]]s from the mosquito's [[saliva]] into a person's [[circulatory system|blood]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; The parasites travel to the [[liver]] where they mature and [[reproduce]].&lt;ref name="Caraballo 2014"/&gt; Five species of ''Plasmodium'' can infect and be spread by humans.&lt;ref name="Caraballo 2014"/&gt; Most deaths are caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum|P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum]]'' because ''[[Plasmodium vivax|P.&amp;nbsp;vivax]]'', ''[[Plasmodium ovale|P.&amp;nbsp;ovale]]'', and ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P.&amp;nbsp;malariae]]'' generally cause a milder form of malaria.&lt;ref name="Caraballo 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; The species ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi|P.&amp;nbsp;knowlesi]]'' rarely causes disease in humans.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; Malaria is typically diagnosed by the [[histology|microscopic examination]] of blood using [[blood film]]s, or with [[Malaria antigen detection tests|antigen-based]] [[rapid diagnostic test]]s.&lt;ref name="Caraballo 2014"/&gt; Methods that use the [[polymerase chain reaction]] to detect the parasite's [[DNA]] have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|common]] due to their cost and complexity.&lt;ref name="Nadjm 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Nadjm B, Behrens RH |title=Malaria: An update for physicians |journal=Infectious Disease Clinics of North America |year=2012 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=243–59 |pmid=22632637 |doi=10.1016/j.idc.2012.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Prevention and treatment--&gt;
The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of [[mosquito net]]s and [[insect repellent]]s, or with [[mosquito control]] measures such as spraying [[insecticide]]s and draining [[standing water]].&lt;ref name="Caraballo 2014"/&gt; Several [[medications]] are available to [[malaria prophylaxis|prevent malaria]] in travellers to areas where the disease is common.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; Occasional doses of the combination medication [[sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine]] are recommended in [[infant]]s and after the [[first trimester]] of [[pregnancy]] in areas with high rates of malaria.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; Despite a need, no effective [[vaccine]] exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; The recommended treatment for malaria is a [[antimalarial medication#Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs)|combination]] of [[antimalarial medication]]s that includes an [[artemisinin]].&lt;ref name="Caraballo 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; The second medication may be either [[mefloquine]], [[lumefantrine]], or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.&lt;ref name=WHO2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Organization|first1=World Health|title=Guidelines for the treatment of malaria|date=2010|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-92-4-154792-5|page=ix|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quinine]] along with [[doxycycline]] may be used if an artemisinin is not available.&lt;ref name=WHO2010/&gt; It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing [[drug resistance]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, [[chloroquine]]-resistant ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=WHO2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaria Fact sheet N°94|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/|website=WHO|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903002027/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/|archive-date=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Epidemiology, society, and culture--&gt;
The disease is widespread in the [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions that exist in a broad band around the [[equator]].&lt;ref name="Caraballo 2014"/&gt; This includes much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; In 2016, there were 216 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 445,000 to 731,000 deaths.&lt;ref name=WHO2017Report/&gt;&lt;ref name=GBD2015De&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators.|title=Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.|journal=Lancet|date=8 October 2016|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1459–1544|pmid=27733281|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(16)31012-1|pmc=5388903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 90% of both cases and deaths occurred in Africa.&lt;ref name=WHO15&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaria Fact sheet N°94|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/|publisher=WHO|accessdate=2 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903002027/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37%,&lt;ref name=WHO15/&gt; but increased from 2014 during which there were 198 million cases.&lt;ref name=WHO2014Book&gt;{{cite book|last1=WHO|title=World Malaria Report 2014|date=2014|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva, Switzerland|isbn=978-92-4-156483-0|pages=32–42|url=http://www.who.int/entity/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a major negative effect on [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="IftSoL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Worrall 2005"/&gt; In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and negative effects on tourism.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2005"/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Symptoms of Malaria.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Main symptoms of malaria&lt;ref name="PPID 2010"/&gt;]]
The signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection,&lt;ref name="PPID 2010"/&gt; but may occur later in those who have taken [[Malaria prophylaxis|antimalarial medications as prevention]].&lt;ref name="Nadjm 2012"/&gt; Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to [[flu]]-like symptoms,&lt;ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/&gt; and can resemble other conditions such as [[sepsis]], [[gastroenteritis]], and [[viral disease]]s.&lt;ref name="Nadjm 2012"/&gt; The presentation may include [[headache]], [[fever]], [[shivering]], [[arthralgia|joint pain]], [[vomiting]], [[hemolytic anemia]], [[jaundice]], [[hemoglobinuria|hemoglobin in the urine]], [[Retinopathy|retinal damage]], and [[convulsion]]s.&lt;ref name="Beare 2006"/&gt;

The classic symptom of malaria is [[Paroxysmal attacks|paroxysm]]—a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days ([[Fever#Types|tertian fever]]) in ''P.&amp;nbsp;vivax'' and ''P.&amp;nbsp;ovale'' infections, and every three days ([[Fever#Types|quartan fever]]) for ''P.&amp;nbsp;malariae''. ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' infection can cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours, or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.&lt;ref name="Ferri 2009"/&gt;

Severe malaria is usually caused by ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' (often referred to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection.&lt;ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/&gt; Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit [[neurological disorder|neurological]] symptoms, including [[abnormal posturing]], [[nystagmus]], [[conjugate gaze palsy]] (failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction), [[opisthotonus]], [[seizure]]s, or [[coma]].&lt;ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/&gt;

===Complications===
Malaria has several serious [[Complication (medicine)|complications]]. Among these is the development of [[respiratory distress]], which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of [[metabolic acidosis]], noncardiogenic [[pulmonary oedema]], concomitant [[pneumonia]], and severe [[anaemia]]. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2012"/&gt; [[Coinfection]] of [[HIV]] with malaria increases mortality.&lt;ref name="Korenromp 2005"/&gt; Renal failure is a feature of [[blackwater fever]], where hemoglobin from [[lysis|lysed]] red blood cells leaks into the urine.&lt;ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/&gt;

Infection with ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' may result in cerebral malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves [[encephalopathy]]. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever.&lt;ref name="Beare 2011"/&gt; [[Splenomegaly|Enlarged spleen]], [[hepatomegaly|enlarged liver]] or [[hepatosplenomegaly|both of these]], severe headache, [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], and [[hemoglobinuria|hemoglobin in the urine]] with [[renal failure]] may occur.&lt;ref name="Bartoloni 2012"/&gt; Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, [[coagulopathy]], and [[circulatory shock|shock]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson's Principles and Practice of Medicine/21st/351&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pregnancy-associated malaria|Malaria in pregnant women]] is an important cause of [[stillbirth]]s, [[infant mortality]], [[abortion]] and [[low birth weight]],&lt;ref name="Hartman 2010"/&gt; particularly in ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' infection, but also with ''P.&amp;nbsp;vivax''.&lt;ref name="Rijken 2012"/&gt;

==Cause==
{{main|Plasmodium}}

Malaria [[parasite]]s belong to the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]'' (phylum [[Apicomplexa]]). In humans, malaria is caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum|P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum]]'', ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P.&amp;nbsp;malariae]]'', ''[[Plasmodium ovale|P.&amp;nbsp;ovale]]'', ''[[Plasmodium vivax|P.&amp;nbsp;vivax]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi|P.&amp;nbsp;knowlesi]]''.&lt;ref name="Mueller 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins 2012"/&gt; Among those infected, ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' is the most common species identified (~75%) followed by ''P.&amp;nbsp;vivax'' (~20%).&lt;ref name="Nadjm 2012"/&gt; Although ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths,&lt;ref name="Sarkar 2009"/&gt; recent evidence suggests that ''P.&amp;nbsp;vivax'' malaria is associated with potentially life-threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of ''P. falciparum'' infection.&lt;ref name="Baird 2013"/&gt; ''P.&amp;nbsp;vivax '' proportionally is more common outside Africa.&lt;ref name="Arnott 2012"/&gt; There have been documented human infections with several species of ''Plasmodium'' from [[simian|higher apes]]; however, except for ''P.&amp;nbsp;knowlesi''—a [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] species that causes malaria in [[macaques]]&lt;ref name="Collins 2012"/&gt;—these are mostly of limited public health importance.&lt;ref name="Collins 2009"/&gt;

===Life cycle===
[[File:Life Cycle of the Malaria Parasite.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The life cycle of malaria parasites. A mosquito causes an infection by a bite. First, sporozoites enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the liver. They infect [[liver cells]], where they multiply into merozoites, rupture the liver cells, and return to the bloodstream. The merozoites infect red blood cells, where they develop into ring forms, trophozoites and schizonts that in turn produce further merozoites. [[Gametocytes|Sexual forms]] are also produced, which, if taken up by a mosquito, will infect the insect and continue the life cycle.]]

In the [[Plasmodium#¬if cycle|life cycle]] of ''Plasmodium'', a female ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito (the [[host (biology)|definitive host]]) transmits a motile infective form (called the [[sporozoite]]) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s), where it reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] (tissue [[schizogony]]), producing thousands of [[merozoite]]s. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlagenhauf-Lawlor|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=54Dza0UHyngC&amp;pg=PA70 70–1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other merozoites develop into immature [[Gametocyte#Gametocytes and malaria|gametocytes]], which are the precursors of male and female [[gamete]]s. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an [[ookinete]]—a fertilized, motile [[zygote]]. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's [[salivary gland]]s, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.&lt;ref name="Cowman 2012"/&gt;

Only female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease. Females of the mosquito genus ''Anopheles'' prefer to feed at night.  They usually start searching for a meal at dusk and will continue throughout the night until taking a meal.&lt;ref name="Arrow 2004"/&gt; Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by [[blood transfusion]]s, although this is rare.&lt;ref name="Owusu-Ofori 2010"/&gt;

===Recurrent malaria===
Symptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, recurrence can be classified as either [[recrudescence]], [[relapse]], or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period. It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant [[Plasmodium#Life cycle|hypnozoites]] in liver cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=MB|title=Malaria: Origin of the Term "Hypnozoite"|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|date=2011|volume=44|pages=781–786|doi=10.1007/s10739-010-9239-3|pmid=20665090}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relapse commonly occurs between 8–24 weeks and is often seen in ''P.&amp;nbsp;vivax'' and ''P.&amp;nbsp;ovale'' infections.&lt;ref name="Nadjm 2012"/&gt; However, relapse-like ''P. vivax'' recurrences are probably being over-attributed to hypnozoite activation. Some of them might have an extra-vascular merozoite origin, making these recurrences recrudescences, not relapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=MB|title=Biological Concepts in Recurrent ''Plasmodium vivax'' Malaria|journal=Parasitology|date=2018|doi=10.1017/S003118201800032X|pmid=29564998}}&lt;/ref&gt; One newly recognized, non-hypnozoite, possible contributing source to recurrent peripheral ''P. vivax'' parasitemia is erythrocytic forms in bone marrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=MB|title=Malaria Eradication and the Hidden Parasite Reservoir|journal=Trends in Parasitology|date=2017|volume=33|pages=492–495|doi=10.1016/j.pt.2017.03.002|pmid=28366603}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P.&amp;nbsp;vivax'' malaria cases in [[temperate]] areas often involve [[overwintering]] by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite.&lt;ref name="White 2011"/&gt; Reinfection means the parasite that caused the past infection was eliminated from the body but a new parasite was introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from recrudescence, although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial infection is typically attributed to treatment failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; People may develop some [[premunity|immunity]] when exposed to frequent infections.&lt;ref name="Tran 2012"/&gt;

===Climate change===
[[Effects of global warming on human health#Malaria|Global climate change]] is likely to affect malaria transmission, but the degree of effect and the areas effected is uncertain.&lt;ref name=who-chap6&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change And Infectious Diseases|url=http://www.who.int/globalchange/climate/en/chapter6.pdf|work=Climate Change and Human Health—Risk and Responses|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063626/http://www.who.int/globalchange/climate/en/chapter6.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater rainfall in certain areas of India and following an [[El Nino]] event is associated with increased mosquito numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate change and human health - risks and responses.

==Pathophysiology==
{{further|Plasmodium falciparum#Pathogenesis}}
[[File:Maternal malaria placenta - cropped - very high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a [[placenta]] from a [[stillbirth]] due to maternal malaria. [[H&amp;E stain]]. Red blood cells are anuclear; blue/black staining in bright red structures (red blood cells) indicate foreign nuclei from the parasites.]]
[[File:Red blood cells infected with malaria.jpg|thumb|Electron micrograph of a ''Plasmodium falciparum''-infected red blood cell (center), illustrating adhesion protein "knobs"]]

Malaria infection develops via two phases: one that involves the [[liver]] (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or [[erythrocyte]]s (erythrocytic phase). When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8–30 days.&lt;ref name="Bledsoe 2005"/&gt;

After a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.&lt;ref name="Bledsoe 2005"/&gt; The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the [[cell membrane]] of the infected host liver cell.&lt;ref name="Vaughan 2008"/&gt;

Within the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.&lt;ref name="Bledsoe 2005"/&gt;

Some ''P.&amp;nbsp;vivax''  sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead, produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (7–10 months is typical) to several years. After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in ''P.&amp;nbsp;vivax'' infections,&lt;ref name="White 2011"/&gt; although their existence in ''P.&amp;nbsp;ovale'' is uncertain.&lt;ref name="Richter 2010"/&gt;

The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body's [[immune system]] because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the [[spleen]]. To avoid this fate, the ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' parasite displays adhesive [[protein]]s on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.&lt;ref name="Tilley 2011"/&gt; The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria.&lt;ref name="Mens 2010"/&gt; Sequestered red blood cells can breach the [[blood–brain barrier]] and cause cerebral malaria.&lt;ref name="Rénia 2012"/&gt;

===Genetic resistance===
{{Main|Human genetic resistance to malaria}}
According to a 2005 review, due to the high levels of [[death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] caused by malaria—especially the ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' species—it has placed the greatest [[Selection (biology)|selective pressure]] on the [[human genome]] in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including [[sickle cell trait]], [[thalassaemia]] traits, [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], and the absence of [[Duffy antigen]]s on red blood cells.&lt;ref name="Kwiatkowski 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hedrick 2011"/&gt;

The impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes a change in the hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow [[capillaries]]; however, when the modified [[hemoglobin S|hemoglobin&amp;nbsp;S]] molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are [[homozygous]] (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta [[allele]]) have [[sickle-cell anaemia]], while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the [[heterozygote advantage|benefits]] provided by the heterozygous form.&lt;ref name="Hedrick 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weatherall 2008"/&gt;

===Liver dysfunction===
Liver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as [[viral hepatitis]] or [[chronic liver disease]]. The syndrome is sometimes called ''malarial hepatitis''.&lt;ref name="Bhalla 2006"/&gt; While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.&lt;ref name="Bhalla 2006"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{Main|Diagnosis of malaria}}
[[File:5901 lores.jpg|thumb|The blood film is the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for malaria diagnosis.]]
[[File:Plasmodium.jpg|thumb|Ring-forms and [[gametocyte]]s of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' in human blood]]
Owing to the non-specific nature of the presentation of symptoms, diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas requires a high degree of suspicion, which might be elicited by any of the following: recent travel history, [[splenomegaly|enlarged spleen]], fever, [[thrombocytopenia|low number of platelets]] in the blood, and [[hyperbilirubinemia|higher-than-normal levels of bilirubin]] in the blood combined with a normal level of [[white blood cells]].&lt;ref name="Nadjm 2012"/&gt; Reports in 2016 and 2017 from countries were malaria is common suggest high levels of over diagnosis due to insufficient or inaccurate laboratory testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manguin|first=Sylvie|last2=Foumane|first2=Vincent|last3=Besnard|first3=Patrick|last4=Fortes|first4=Filomeno|last5=Carnevale|first5=Pierre|date=July 2017|title=Malaria overdiagnosis and subsequent overconsumption of antimalarial drugs in Angola: Consequences and effects on human health |journal=Acta Tropica|volume=171|pages=58–63|doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.03.022 |pmid=28356231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orish|first=Verner N.|last2=Ansong|first2=Joseph Y.|last3=Onyeabor|first3=Onyekachi S.|last4=Sanyaolu|first4=Adekunle O.|last5=Oyibo|first5=Wellington A.|last6=Iriemenam|first6=Nnaemeka C.|date=October 2016|title=Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of malaria in children in a secondary healthcare centre in Sekondi-Takoradi, Ghana |journal=Tropical Doctor|volume=46|issue=4|pages=191–8|doi=10.1177/0049475515622861 |pmid=26738767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yegorov|first=Sergey|last2=Galiwango|first2=Ronald M.|last3=Ssemaganda|first3=Aloysious|last4=Muwanga|first4=Moses|last5=Wesonga|first5=Irene|last6=Miiro|first6=George|last7=Drajole|first7=David A.|last8=Kain|first8=Kevin C.|last9=Kiwanuka|first9=Noah|date=2016-11-14|title=Low prevalence of laboratory-confirmed malaria in clinically diagnosed adult women from the Wakiso district of Uganda |journal=Malaria Journal|volume=15|issue=1|pages=555|doi=10.1186/s12936-016-1604-z |pmc=5109652|pmid=27842555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaria is usually confirmed by the microscopic examination of [[blood film]]s or by [[antigen]]-based [[Malaria antigen detection tests|rapid diagnostic tests]] (RDT).&lt;ref name="Abba 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kattenberg 2011"/&gt; In some areas, RDTs need to be able to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by ''Plasmodium falciparum'' or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-''P. falciparum'' infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abba|first1=Katharine|last2=Kirkham|first2=Amanda J|last3=Olliaro|first3=Piero L|last4=Deeks|first4=Jonathan J|last5=Donegan|first5=Sarah|last6=Garner|first6=Paul|last7=Takwoingi|first7=Yemisi|title=Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 December 2014|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd011431|pmid=25519857|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011431/full|volume=12|pmc=4453861|pages=CD011431|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126091036/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011431/full|archivedate=26 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010.&lt;ref name="Wilson 2012"/&gt; Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.&lt;ref name="Wilson 2012"/&gt;

In regions where laboratory tests are readily available, malaria should be suspected, and tested for, in any unwell person who has been in an area where malaria is endemic. In areas that cannot afford laboratory diagnostic tests, it has become common to use only a history of fever as the indication to treat for malaria—thus the common teaching "fever equals malaria unless proven otherwise". A drawback of this practice is [[overdiagnosis]] of malaria and mismanagement of non-malarial fever, which wastes limited resources, erodes confidence in the health care system, and contributes to drug resistance.&lt;ref name="Perkins 2008"/&gt; Although [[polymerase chain reaction]]-based tests have been developed, they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common as of 2012, due to their complexity.&lt;ref name="Nadjm 2012"/&gt;

===Classification===
Malaria is classified into either "severe" or "uncomplicated" by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref name="Nadjm 2012"/&gt; It is deemed severe when ''any'' of the following criteria are present, otherwise it is considered uncomplicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decreased consciousness
* Significant weakness such that the person is unable to walk
* Inability to feed
* Two or more [[convulsions]]
* [[Low blood pressure]] (less than 70&amp;nbsp;[[mmHg]] in adults and 50&amp;nbsp;mmHg in children)
* [[respiratory distress|Breathing problems]]
* [[Circulatory shock]]
* [[Kidney failure]] or [[hemoglobin]] in the urine
* Bleeding problems, or hemoglobin less than 50&amp;nbsp;g/L (5&amp;nbsp;g/dL)
* [[Pulmonary oedema]]
* [[Blood glucose]] less than 2.2&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (40&amp;nbsp;mg/dL)
* [[Acidosis]] or [[lactic acid|lactate]] levels of greater than 5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L
* A parasite level in the blood of greater than 100,000 per [[microlitre]] (µL) in low-intensity transmission areas, or 250,000 per µL in high-intensity transmission areas

Cerebral malaria is defined as a severe ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum''-malaria presenting with neurological symptoms, including coma (with a [[Glasgow coma scale]] less than 11, or a [[Blantyre coma scale]] less than 3), or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after a seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
&lt;!-- The list of methods seems to put the least cost-effective first. What's the reason for that? --&gt;
[[File:Anopheles stephensi.jpeg|thumb|An ''[[Anopheles stephensi]]'' mosquito shortly after obtaining blood from a human (the droplet of blood is expelled as a surplus). This mosquito is a vector of malaria, and mosquito control is an effective way of reducing its incidence.]]

Methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no [[malaria vaccine|vaccine for malaria]]. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.&lt;ref name="whqlibdoc"/&gt;

Prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the [[capital cost|initial costs]] required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the [[Chinese province]]s—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.&lt;ref name="Sabot 2010"/&gt;

In areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have [[anemia]] which is sometimes due to malaria. Giving children with anemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but did not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Athuman|first1=M|last2=Kabanywanyi|first2=AM|last3=Rohwer|first3=AC|title=Intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment for children with anaemia.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=13 January 2015|volume=1|pages=CD010767|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010767.pub2|pmid=25582096|pmc=4447115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mosquito control===
{{further|Mosquito control}}
[[File:Mansprayingkeroseneoil.jpg|thumb|left|Man spraying kerosene oil in standing water, [[Panama Canal Zone]] 1912]]
[[Vector control]] refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes. For individual protection, the most effective [[insect repellent]]s are based on [[DEET]] or [[picaridin]].&lt;ref name="Kajfasz 2009"/&gt; Insecticide-treated [[mosquito net]]s (ITNs) and [[indoor residual spraying]] (IRS) have been shown to be highly effective in preventing malaria among children in areas where malaria is common.&lt;ref name="Lengeler 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pluess 2010"/&gt; Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=J.|title=WHO gives indoor use of DDT a clean bill of health for controlling malaria|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/|publisher=WHO|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022215922/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/|archivedate=2012-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mosquitoes-Killedy-By-DDT-Lake-Victoria.JPG|thumb|right|Walls where indoor residual spraying of DDT has been applied. The mosquitoes remain on the wall until they fall down dead on the floor.]]

&lt;!-- Bet nets  --&gt;
[[File:Mosquitonet149.jpg|thumb|A mosquito net in use.]]
Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria. Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net.&lt;ref name="Raghavendra 2011"/&gt; Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Howitt 2012"/&gt; About 13% of households in Sub-Saharan countries owned ITNs in 2007&lt;ref name="Miller 2007"/&gt; and 31% of African households were estimated to own at least one ITN in 2008. In 2000, 1.7 million (1.8%) African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3 million (18.5%) African children using ITNs in 2007, leaving 89.6 million children unprotected&lt;ref name="Noor 2009"/&gt; and to 68% African children using mosquito nets in 2015.&lt;ref name = UNICEF2015/&gt;  Most nets are impregnated with [[pyrethroid]]s, a class of insecticides with low [[toxicity]]. They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schlagenhauf-Lawlor|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=54Dza0UHyngC&amp;pg=PA215 215]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended to hang a large "bed net" above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Instructions for treatment and use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets|date=2002|publisher=World Health Organization|page=34|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2002/WHO_CDS_RBM_2002.41.pdf|format=pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706081401/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2002/WHO_CDS_RBM_2002.41.pdf|archivedate=2015-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Indoor residual spraying --&gt;
Indoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite.&lt;ref name="Enayati 2010"/&gt; As of 2006, the [[World Health Organization]] recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including [[DDT#Use against malaria|DDT]] and the pyrethroids [[cyfluthrin]] and [[deltamethrin]].&lt;ref name="WHO Indoor Residual Spraying"/&gt; This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the [[Stockholm Convention]], which prohibits its agricultural use.&lt;ref name="van den Berg 2009"/&gt; One problem with all forms of IRS is [[insecticide resistance]]. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.&lt;ref name="Pates 2005"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Other --&gt;
There are a number of other methods to reduce mosquito bites and slow the spread of malaria. Efforts to decrease mosquito larva by decreasing the availability of open water in which they develop or by adding substances to decrease their development is effective in some locations.&lt;ref name="Tusting 2013"/&gt; Electronic mosquito repellent devices which make very high-frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away, do not have supporting evidence.&lt;ref name="Enayati 2007"/&gt;

===Other methods===
Community participation and [[health education]] strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world.&lt;ref name="Lalloo 2006"/&gt;  Recognizing the disease in the early stages can prevent the disease from becoming fatal.  Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water, such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people. This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas.&lt;ref name="Mehlhorn 2008"/&gt; [[Intermittent preventive therapy]] is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants,&lt;ref name="Bardají 2012"/&gt; and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal.&lt;ref name="Meremikwu 2012"/&gt;

===Medications===
{{Main|Malaria prophylaxis}}
There are a number of medications that can help prevent or interrupt malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these medications are also used in treatment. In places where ''Plasmodium'' is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—[[mefloquine]], [[doxycycline]] , or the combination of [[atovaquone/proguanil]] (''Malarone'')—are frequently used for prevention.&lt;ref name=Tic2017/&gt; Doxycycline and the atovaquone/proguanil are better tolerated while mefloquine is taken once a week.&lt;ref name=Tic2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tickell-Painter|first1=M|last2=Maayan|first2=N|last3=Saunders|first3=R|last4=Pace|first4=C|last5=Sinclair|first5=D|title=Mefloquine for preventing malaria during travel to endemic areas.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=30 October 2017|volume=10|pages=CD006491|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006491.pub4|pmid=29083100|pmc=5686653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of the world with [[chloroquine]] sensitive malaria are uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CDC - Malaria - Malaria Worldwide - How Can Malaria Cases and Deaths Be Reduced? - Drug resistance in the Malaria Endemic World|url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/drug_resistance.html|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=4 January 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protective effect does not begin immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward).&lt;ref name="Freedman 2008"/&gt; The use of preventative drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations.&lt;ref name="Fernando 2011"/&gt; During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of [[anemia]] in the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radeva-Petrova|first1=D|last2=Kayentao|first2=K|last3=Ter Kuile|first3=FO|last4=Sinclair|first4=D|last5=Garner|first5=P|title=Drugs for preventing malaria in pregnant women in endemic areas: any drug regimen versus placebo or no treatment.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=10 October 2014|volume=10|pages=CD000169|pmid=25300703|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000169.pub3|pmc=4498495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.&lt;ref name="Turschner 2009"/&gt;

Malaria is treated with [[antimalarial medication]]s; the ones used depends on the type and severity of the disease. While [[antipyretics|medications against fever]] are commonly used, their effects on outcomes are not clear.&lt;ref name="Meremikwu 2012b"/&gt;

&lt;!--Uncomplicated  --&gt;
Simple or uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications. The most effective treatment for ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' infection is the use of [[artemisinin]]s in combination with other antimalarials (known as [[artemisinin-combination therapy]], or ACT), which decreases resistance to any single drug component.&lt;ref name="Kokwaro 2009"/&gt; These additional antimalarials include: [[amodiaquine]], [[lumefantrine]], mefloquine or [[sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|WHO|2010|pp=75–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recommended combination is [[dihydroartemisinin]] and [[piperaquine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|WHO|2010|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keating 2012"/&gt; ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria.&lt;ref name="Howitt 2012"/&gt; To treat malaria during pregnancy, the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] recommends the use of quinine plus [[clindamycin]] early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters).&lt;ref name="Manyando 2012"/&gt; In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="O'Brien 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairhurst 2012"/&gt; Infection with ''P.&amp;nbsp;vivax'', ''P.&amp;nbsp;ovale'' or ''P.&amp;nbsp;malariae'' usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of ''P.&amp;nbsp;vivax'' requires both treatment of blood stages (with chloroquine or ACT) and clearance of liver forms with [[primaquine]].&lt;ref name="Waters 2012"/&gt; Treatment with [[tafenoquine]] prevents relapses after confirmed ''P. vivax'' malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajapakse|first1=Senaka|last2=Rodrigo|first2=Chaturaka|last3=Fernando|first3=Sumadhya Deepika|title=Tafenoquine for preventing relapse in people with ''Plasmodium vivax'' malaria|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=29 April 2015|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd010458.pub2|pmid=25921416|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010458.pub2/full|volume=4|pmc=4468925|pages=CD010458|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126094801/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010458.pub2/full|archivedate=26 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Severe  and complicated--&gt;
Severe and complicated malaria are almost always caused by infection with ''P. falciparum''. The other species usually cause only febrile disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kochar|first1=DK|last2=Saxena|first2=V|last3=Singh|first3=N|last4=Kochar|first4=SK|last5=Kumar|first5=SV|last6=Das|first6=A|title=Plasmodium vivax malaria.|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=January 2005|volume=11|issue=1|pages=132–4|pmid=15705338|doi=10.3201/eid1101.040519|pmc=3294370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severe and complicated malaria are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high (10% to 50%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasvol|first1=G|title=The treatment of complicated and severe malaria.|journal=British Medical Bulletin|date=2005|volume=75–76|pages=29–47|pmid=16495509|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldh059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cerebral malaria is the form of severe and complicated malaria with the worst neurological symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Idro|first1=R|last2=Marsh|first2=K|last3=John|first3=CC|last4=Newton|first4=CR|title=Cerebral malaria: mechanisms of brain injury and strategies for improved neurocognitive outcome.|journal=Pediatric Research|date=October 2010|volume=68|issue=4|pages=267–74|pmid=20606600|doi=10.1203/pdr.0b013e3181eee738|pmc=3056312}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recommended treatment for severe malaria is the [[parenteral administration|intravenous]] use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, [[parenteral]] artesunate was superior to quinine in both children and adults.&lt;ref name="Sinclair 2012"/&gt; In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyu|first1=Hmwe Hmwe|last2=Fernández|first2=Eduardo|title=Artemisinin derivatives versus quinine for cerebral malaria in African children: a systematic review|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=2009|volume=87|pages=896–904|doi=10.2471/BLT.08.060327|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/12/08-060327/en/|pmid=20454480|pmc=2789363|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051023/http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/12/08-060327/en/|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a [[critical care unit]]. This includes the management of [[hyperpyrexia|high fevers]] and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for [[respiratory depression|poor breathing effort]], low blood sugar, and [[hypokalemia|low blood potassium]].&lt;ref name="Sarkar 2009"/&gt;

===Resistance===
[[Drug resistance]] poses a growing problem in 21st-century malaria treatment.&lt;ref name="SinhaMedhi2014"/&gt; Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from [[artemisinin]]s. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world.&lt;ref name="White 2008"/&gt; Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable.&lt;ref name="Wongsrichanalai 2008"/&gt; Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years and the availability of substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype.&lt;ref name="Dondorp 2010"/&gt; Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=World Health Organization |title=Q&amp;A on artemisinin resistance |journal=WHO malaria publications |year=2013 |url=http://www.who.int/malaria/media/artemisinin_resistance_qa/en/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720075407/http://www.who.int/malaria/media/artemisinin_resistance_qa/en/index.html |archivedate=2016-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Helen (30 July 2014) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28569966 Call for 'radical action' on drug-resistant malaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731210937/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28569966 |date=2014-07-31 }} BBC News, health, Retrieved 30 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashley 2014"/&gt;

When properly treated, people with malaria can usually expect a complete recovery.&lt;ref name="CDC Malaria"/&gt; However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days.&lt;ref name="Trampuz 2003"/&gt; In the most severe cases of the disease, [[fatality rate]]s can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment.&lt;ref name="Nadjm 2012"/&gt; Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria.&lt;ref name="Fernando 2010"/&gt; [[chronic (medicine)|Chronic]] infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to ''[[Salmonella]]'' bacteria and the [[Epstein–Barr virus]].&lt;ref name="Riley 2013"/&gt;

During childhood, malaria causes anemia during a period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage resulting from cerebral malaria.&lt;ref name="Fernando 2010"/&gt; Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, [[Emotional and behavioral disorders|behavioural disorders]], and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Idro 2010"/&gt; Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in [[clinical trial]]s when compared to [[placebo]] groups.&lt;ref name="Fernando 2010"/&gt;

Malaria is presently endemic in a broad band around the equator, in areas of the Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 85–90% of malaria fatalities occur.&lt;ref name="Layne 2006"/&gt; An estimate for 2009 reported that countries with the highest death rate per 100,000 of population were [[Ivory Coast]] (86.15), [[Angola]] (56.93) and [[Burkina Faso]] (50.66).&lt;ref name="Provost 2011"/&gt; A 2010 estimate indicated the deadliest countries per population were Burkina Faso, [[Mozambique]] and [[Mali]].&lt;ref name="lancet-glob-mal-mort"/&gt; The [[Malaria Atlas Project]] aims to map global [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] levels of malaria, providing a means with which to determine the global spatial limits of the disease and to assess [[disease burden]].&lt;ref name="Guerra 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hay 2010"/&gt; This effort led to the publication of a map of ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' endemicity in 2010.&lt;ref name="Gething 2011"/&gt; As of 2010, about 100 countries have endemic malaria.&lt;ref name="World Malaria Report 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feachem 2010"/&gt; Every year, 125 million international travellers visit these countries, and more than 30,000 contract the disease.&lt;ref name="Kajfasz 2009"/&gt;

The geographic distribution of malaria within large regions is complex, and malaria-afflicted and malaria-free areas are often found close to each other.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2002"/&gt; Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall, consistent high temperatures and high humidity, along with stagnant waters in which mosquito larvae readily mature, providing them with the environment they need for continuous breeding.&lt;ref name="Jamieson 2006"/&gt; In drier areas, outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall.&lt;ref name="Abeku 2007"/&gt; Malaria is more common in rural areas than in cities. For example, several cities in the [[Greater Mekong Subregion]] of Southeast Asia are essentially malaria-free, but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions, including along international borders and forest fringes.&lt;ref name="Cui 2012"/&gt; In contrast, malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas, though the risk is lower in the larger cities.&lt;ref name="Machault 2011"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of malaria|Mosquito-malaria theory}}
[[File:Malaria pathogens.jpg|thumb|upright|Ancient malaria oocysts preserved in [[Dominican amber]]]] 
Although the parasite responsible for ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' malaria has been in existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of the parasite did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture&lt;ref name="Harper 2011"/&gt; and the development of human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' malaria may have originated in gorillas.&lt;ref name="Prugnolle 2012"/&gt;

References to the unique periodic fevers of malaria are found throughout recorded history.&lt;ref name="Cox 2002"/&gt; Hippocrates described periodic fevers, labelling them tertian, quartan, subtertian and quotidian.&lt;ref name="The Blakiston company"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strong|first1=Richard P|title=Stitt's Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment of Tropical Diseases|date=1944|publisher=The Blakiston Company|location=York, PA|page=3|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman [[Columella]] associated the disease with insects from swamps.&lt;ref name="The Blakiston company"/&gt; Malaria may have contributed to the decline of the [[Roman Empire]],&lt;ref name="Sallares 2001"/&gt; and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the "[[Roman Fever (disease)|Roman fever]]".&lt;ref name="Sallares 2003"/&gt; Several regions in ancient Rome were considered at-risk for the disease because of the favourable conditions present for malaria vectors. This included areas such as southern Italy, the island of [[Sardinia]], the [[Pontine Marshes]], the lower regions of coastal [[Etruria]] and the city of [[Rome]] along the [[Tiber]]. The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds. Irrigated gardens, swamp-like grounds, runoff from agriculture, and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water.&lt;ref name="Hays 2005"/&gt;

[[File:Ronald Ross.jpg|thumb|left|British doctor [[Ronald Ross]] received the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1902 for his work on malaria.]]

The term malaria originates from [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] {{lang-it|mala aria}}—"[[miasma theory of disease|bad air]]"; the disease was formerly called ''ague'' or ''marsh fever'' due to its association with swamps and marshland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reiter|first1=P|title=From Shakespeare to Defoe: malaria in England in the Little Ice Age.|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|date=1999|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–11|pmid=10653562|doi=10.3201/eid0601.000101|pmc=2627969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term first appeared in the English literature about 1829.&lt;ref name="The Blakiston company"/&gt; Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America,&lt;ref name="Lindemann 1999"/&gt; where it is no longer endemic,&lt;ref name="Gratz 2006"/&gt; though imported cases do occur.&lt;ref name="Webb 2009"/&gt;

Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880, when [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]]—a French army doctor working in the military hospital of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] in [[Algeria]]—observed parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time. He, therefore, proposed that malaria is caused by this organism, the first time a [[protist]] was identified as causing disease.&lt;ref name="Laveran bio"/&gt; For this and later discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]].  A year later, [[Carlos Finlay]], a Cuban doctor treating people with [[yellow fever]] in [[Havana]], provided strong evidence that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans.&lt;ref name="Tan 2008"/&gt; This work followed earlier suggestions by [[Josiah C. Nott]],&lt;ref name="Chernin 1983"/&gt; and work by [[Sir Patrick Manson]], the "father of tropical medicine", on the transmission of [[filariasis]].&lt;ref name="Chernin 1977"/&gt;

[[File:Tu Youyou 5012-1-2015.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese [[traditional Chinese medicine]] researcher [[Tu Youyou]] received the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 2015 for her work on the antimalarial drug [[artemisinin]].]]

In April 1894, a Scottish physician, [[Ronald Ross|Sir Ronald Ross]], visited Sir Patrick Manson at his house on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit was the start of four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the [[Presidency General Hospital]] in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.&lt;ref name="Ross bio"/&gt; For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the [[Indian Medical Service]], Ross worked at the newly established [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]] and directed malaria-control efforts in [[Egypt]], [[Panama]], [[Greece]] and [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref name="CDC Ross"/&gt; The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by [[Walter Reed]] in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by [[William C. Gorgas]] in [[Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal|the health measures undertaken]] during construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.&lt;ref name="Simmons 1979"/&gt;

The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of [[Cinchona|cinchona tree]], which contains [[quinine]]. This tree grows on the slopes of the [[Andes]], mainly in [[Peru]]. The [[indigenous peoples of Peru]] made a [[tincture]] of cinchona to control fever.  Its effectiveness against malaria was found and the [[Jesuit]]s introduced the treatment to Europe around 1640; by 1677, it was included in the [[London Pharmacopoeia]] as an antimalarial treatment.&lt;ref name="Kaufman 2005"/&gt; It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier]] and [[Joseph Bienaimé Caventou]].&lt;ref name="Pelletier 1820"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kyle 1974"/&gt;

Quinine became the predominant malarial medication until the 1920s when other medications began to be developed. In the 1940s, chloroquine replaced quinine as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance supervened, first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Achan 2011"/&gt;

The medicinal value of ''[[Artemisia annua]]'' has been used by Chinese herbalists in [[traditional Chinese medicines]] for 2,000 years. In 1596, Li Shizhen recommended tea made from qinghao specifically to treat malaria symptoms in his "[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]".  Artemisinins, discovered by Chinese scientist [[Tu Youyou]] and colleagues in the 1970s from the plant ''Artemisia annua'', became the recommended treatment for ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' malaria, administered in severe cases in combination with other antimalarials.&lt;ref name="Hsu 2006"/&gt; Tu says she was influenced by a [[Chinese herbology|traditional Chinese herbal medicine]] source, ''The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments'', written in 340 by [[Ge Hong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hao |first=C. |date=29 September 2011 |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/asia/2011/09/lasker-award-rekindles-debate-over-artemisinins-discovery |title=Lasker Award Rekindles Debate Over Artemisinin's Discovery |publisher=Science/AAAS |work=News: ScienceInsider |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104214759/http://news.sciencemag.org/asia/2011/09/lasker-award-rekindles-debate-over-artemisinins-discovery |archivedate=4 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For her work on malaria, [[Tu Youyou]] received the 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref name=Nobel&gt;{{cite web |title = Nobel Prize announcement |url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2015/press.pdf |website = NobelPrize.org |accessdate = 5 October 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006112430/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2015/press.pdf |archivedate = 6 October 2015 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Plasmodium vivax'' was used between 1917 and the 1940s for [[malariotherapy]]—deliberate injection of malaria parasites to induce a fever to combat certain diseases such as tertiary [[syphilis]].  In 1927, the inventor of this technique, [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]], received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries.  The technique was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use.&lt;ref name="Vogel 2013"/&gt;

[[File:GuadMarinesMalaria.gif|thumb|U.S. Marines with malaria in a rough field hospital on [[Guadalcanal]], October 1942]]

The first pesticide used for indoor residual spraying was [[DDT]].&lt;ref name="CDC history"/&gt; Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria, its use quickly spread to [[agriculture]]. In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of [[pesticide resistance|resistant]] mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes can be compared to [[antibiotic resistance]] shown by bacteria.  During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="van den Berg 2009"/&gt; Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larva stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound [[Paris Green]] to places with standing water.&lt;ref name="Killeen 2002"/&gt;

[[Malaria vaccine]]s have been an elusive goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-[[Attenuator (genetics)|attenuated]] sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies for humans.&lt;ref name="Vanderberg 2009"/&gt; The first vaccine, called [[RTS,S]], was approved by European regulators in 2015.&lt;ref name="Walsh2015"/&gt;

==Society and culture==

=== Economic impact ===
[[File:Saving Lives with SMS for Life.jpg|thumb|right|Malaria clinic in Tanzania]]

Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="IftSoL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Worrall 2005"/&gt; Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a major factor in the slow economic development of the American southern states.&lt;ref name="Humphreys 2001"/&gt;

A comparison of average per capita [[GDP]] in 1995, adjusted for [[purchasing power parity|parity of purchasing power]], between countries with malaria and countries without malaria gives a fivefold difference ($1,526 USD versus $8,268 USD). In the period 1965 to 1990, countries where malaria was common had an average per capita GDP that increased only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.&lt;ref name="Sachs 2002"/&gt;

Poverty can increase the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 2005"/&gt; The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30–50% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of [[outpatient]] visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.&lt;ref name="Roll Back Malaria WHO"/&gt;

[[File:Malaria Patient, Nyangaton, Ethiopia (15151075077).jpg|thumb|Child with malaria in [[Ethiopia]]]]
Cerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children.&lt;ref name="Idro 2010"/&gt; Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery.&lt;ref name="Fernando 2010"/&gt; Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching [[socioeconomic]] consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.&lt;ref name="Ricci 2012"/&gt;

===Counterfeit and substandard drugs===
Sophisticated [[counterfeit drugs|counterfeits]] have been found in several Asian countries such as [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref name="Lon 2006"/&gt; [[People's Republic of China|China]],&lt;ref name="Newton 2008"/&gt; [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]], and are an important cause of avoidable death in those countries.&lt;ref name="Newton 2006"/&gt; The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater [[Mekong]] region and have established a rapid alert system to enable information about counterfeit drugs to be rapidly reported to the relevant authorities in participating countries.&lt;ref name="Parry 2005"/&gt; There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory. Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution.&lt;ref name="Gautam 2009"/&gt;

Another clinical and public health concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging.&lt;ref name="Caudron 2008"/&gt; A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.&lt;ref name="Nayyar 2012"/&gt;

===War===
[[File:"Don't go to Bed with Malaria Mosquito" - NARA - 514146.tif|thumb|right|World War II poster]]
Throughout history, the contraction of malaria has played a prominent role in the fates of government rulers, nation-states, military personnel, and military actions.&lt;ref name="Russell 2009"/&gt; In 1910, [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]]-winner Ronald Ross (himself a malaria survivor), published a book titled ''The Prevention of Malaria'' that included a chapter titled "The Prevention of Malaria in War." The chapter's author, Colonel C. H. Melville, Professor of Hygiene at [[Royal Army Medical College]] in London, addressed the prominent role that malaria has historically played during wars: "The history of malaria in war might almost be taken to be the history of war itself, certainly the history of war in the Christian era.&amp;nbsp;... It is probably the case that many of the so-called camp fevers, and probably also a considerable proportion of the camp dysentery, of the wars of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were malarial in origin."&lt;ref name="Ross 1910"/&gt;

Malaria was the most significant health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during [[World War II]], where about 500,000 men were infected.&lt;ref name="Bray 2004"/&gt; According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, "Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns."&lt;ref name="Byrne 2008"/&gt;

Significant financial investments have been made to procure existing and create new anti-malarial agents. During [[World War I]] and World War II, inconsistent supplies of the natural anti-malaria drugs [[cinchona bark]] and quinine prompted substantial funding into [[research and development]] of other drugs and vaccines.  American military organizations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center, [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]], and the [[U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] of the US Armed Forces.&lt;ref name="malariasite1"/&gt;

Additionally, initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA), established in 1942, and its successor, the Communicable Disease Center (now known as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], or CDC) established in 1946.  According to the CDC, MCWA "was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories, where malaria was still problematic".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Eradication efforts===
[[File:Members of the Malaria Commission on the Danube delta, 1929 Wellcome L0011626.jpg|thumb|Members of the Malaria Commission of the [[League of Nations]] collecting larvae on the [[Danube delta]], 1929]]
Several notable attempts are being made to eliminate the parasite from sections of the world, or to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate it worldwide]]. In 2006, the organization [[Malaria No More]] set a public goal of eliminating malaria from Africa by 2015, and the organization plans to dissolve if that goal is accomplished.&lt;ref name="Strom 2011"/&gt;  Several malaria vaccines are in clinical trials, which are intended to provide protection for children in endemic areas and reduce the speed of transmission of the disease. {{As of|2012}}, [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] has distributed 230 million insecticide-treated nets intended to stop mosquito-borne transmission of malaria.&lt;ref name="Global Fund"/&gt; The U.S.-based [[Clinton Foundation]] has worked to manage demand and stabilize prices in the artemisinin market.&lt;ref name="WSJ 2008"/&gt;  Other efforts, such as the Malaria Atlas Project, focus on analysing climate and weather information required to accurately predict the spread of malaria based on the availability of habitat of malaria-carrying parasites.&lt;ref name="Guerra 2007"/&gt; The [[Malaria Policy Advisory Committee]] (MPAC) of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) was formed in 2012, "to provide strategic advice and technical input to WHO on all aspects of malaria control and elimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive summary and key points|url=http://www.who.int/entity/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2013/wmr13_summary_key_points.pdf?ua=1|work=World Malaria Report 2013|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=13 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091723/http://www.who.int/entity/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2013/wmr13_summary_key_points.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2013, WHO and the malaria vaccine funders group set a goal to develop vaccines designed to interrupt malaria transmission with the long-term goal of malaria eradication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Malaria Report 2013|url=http://www.who.int/entity/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2013/wmr2013_no_profiles.pdf?ua=1|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=13 February 2014 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaria has been successfully eliminated or greatly reduced in certain areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of [[wetland]] breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in [[water management]] practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings.&lt;ref name="Meade 2010"/&gt; Malaria was eliminated from most parts of the USA in the early 20th century by such methods, and the use of the [[pesticide]] DDT and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets in the South in the 1950s as part of the [[National Malaria Eradication Program]].&lt;ref name="Williams 1963"/&gt;

In 2018, WHO announced that Paraguay was free of malaria, after an eradication effort that began in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/11-06-2018-who-certifies-paraguay-malaria-free|accessdate=17 June 2018|date=11 June 2018|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|title=WHO certifies Paraguay malaria-free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the WHO targeted a 90% reduction in deaths from malaria by 2030&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and Bill Gates said in 2016 that he thought global eradication would be possible by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/public-health-threats-and-pandemics/can-malaria-eradicated/p38243 |title=Can Malaria Be Eradicated? |first=Danielle |last=Radwick |date=October 5, 2016 |publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005201520/http://www.cfr.org/public-health-threats-and-pandemics/can-malaria-eradicated/p38243 |archivedate=October 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) initiative was a consultative process to identify which areas of research and development (R&amp;D) needed to be addressed for the worldwide eradication of malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=B.

===Vaccine===
{{See also|Malaria vaccine}}
A vaccine against malaria called [[RTS,S]], was approved by European regulators in 2015.&lt;ref name="Walsh2015"/&gt; It is undergoing pilot trials in select countries in 2016.

Immunity (or, more accurately, [[immune tolerance|tolerance]]) to ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' malaria does occur naturally, but only in response to years of repeated infection.&lt;ref name="Tran 2012"/&gt; An individual can be protected from a ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry a version of the parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of [[X-ray]] [[irradiation]].&lt;ref name="Hill 2011"/&gt; The highly [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] nature of many ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'' proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito.&lt;ref name="Cromptom 2010"/&gt; Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.&lt;ref name="Graves 2006b"/&gt; For example, [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo|SPf66]]  was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.&lt;ref name="Graves 2006"/&gt;

===Medications===
Malaria parasites contain [[apicoplast]]s, organelles usually found in plants, complete with their own [[genome]]s. These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]] of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as [[fatty acid biosynthesis]]. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel anti-malarial drugs.&lt;ref name="Kalanon 2010"/&gt;

With the onset of drug-resistant ''Plasmodium'' parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic [[pyridoxal]]-amino acid [[adduct]]s, which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential [[B vitamin]]s.&lt;ref name="Müller 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Du 2011"/&gt; Antimalarial drugs using [[Organometallic chemistry|synthetic metal-based]] [[coordination complex|complexes]] are attracting research interest.&lt;ref name="Biot 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roux 2012"/&gt;

*(+)-SJ733: Part of a wider class of experimental drugs called [[spiroindolone]].  It inhibits the ATP4 protein of infected red blood cells that cause the cells to shrink and become rigid like the aging cells. This triggers the immune system to eliminate the infected cells from the system as demonstrated in a mouse model.  As of 2014, a [[Phases of clinical research#Phase 1|Phase 1 clinical trial]] to assess the safety profile in human is planned by the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].&lt;ref name=atp4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/new-malaria-drug-unleashes-immune-system-assault-infected-cells/2014-12-08|title=New malaria drug unleashes an immune system assault on infected cells|author=Carroll John|publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=8 December 2014|accessdate=16 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404040409/http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/new-malaria-drug-unleashes-immune-system-assault-infected-cells/2014-12-08|archivedate=4 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
A non-chemical vector control strategy involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in [[genetic engineering]] technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. [[Sterile insect technique]] is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.&lt;ref name="Raghavendra 2011"/&gt;

[[Genomics]] is central to malaria research. With the [[whole genome sequencing|sequencing]] of ''P.&amp;nbsp;falciparum'', one of its vectors ''Anopheles gambiae'', and the [[human genome]], the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria lifecycle can be studied.&lt;ref name="Aultman 2002"/&gt; Another new application of genetic technology is the ability to produce [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria, potentially allowing [[biological control]] of malaria transmission.&lt;ref name="Ito 2002"/&gt;

[[Maternal death|Maternal mortality]] refers to the death of a woman during her pregnancy or up to a year after her pregnancy has terminated, if the death was related to her pregnancy.&lt;ref name="NYC_5YRplan_2018"/&gt; The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) monitors maternal death per 100,000 live births. The CDC reported a baseline maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 18.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 births in 2016,&lt;ref name=macdorman/&gt; which was higher than anticipated. In 2014 there was a 26.6% increase representing 23.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 births.&lt;ref name=macdorman/&gt;&lt;ref name="ObstetGynecol_Chescheir_2016"/&gt; Maternal mortality as well as [[maternal morbidity]] has been increasing over the last several decades in the United States, with an estimated 50% of deaths due to preventable causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Troiano|first=Nan H.|last2=Witcher|first2=Patricia M.|date=2018|title=Maternal Mortality and Morbidity in the United States|url=https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00005237-201807000-00007|journal=The Journal of Perinatal &amp; Neonatal Nursing|language=en|volume=32|issue=3|pages=222–231|doi=10.1097/jpn.0000000000000349|issn=0893-2190}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 2010, although the United States was spending more on healthcare than any other country in the world, more than two women died during [[childbirth]] every day, making maternal mortality the highest in the United States compared to 49 other countries in the [[Developed country|developed world]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/694184792|title=Deadly delivery : the maternal health care crisis in the USA.|date=2010|publisher=Amnesty International Publications|others=Amnesty International.|isbn=9780862104580|location=London, England|oclc=694184792}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three times higher than neighboring Canada.&lt;ref name="npr_focus"/&gt; In 2016, as many as 900 women between the ages of 16 and 43, died from pregnancy- and childbirth-related causes.&lt;ref name="ProPublica_Martin"/&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] declares that 60% of these deaths are preventable.

In the U.S., hospital bills for maternal healthcare costs over $98 billion, and concerns about the degradation of the MMR resulted in a state-by-state breakdown. Race, location, and financial status all contribute to how maternal mortality affects women across the country, but Texas has the worst MMR, which caused the Department of State to create the [[Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force]] in 2013.

==Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)==
In 1986, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)&lt;ref name="CDC_PMSS_2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm |title=Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System|date=July 25, 2018 |access-date=August 4, 2018 |location=Atlanta, Georgia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)]] created the Pregnancy-Related Mortality Surveillance System to monitor maternal death within a year of women giving birth and dying from any and all pregnancy and childbirth related causes per 100,000 live births. Prior to this change, the [[Maternal Mortality Ratio|maternal mortality ratio]] monitored women 6 weeks postpartum per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kilpatrick|first=Sarah J|date=2015-03-01|title=Next Steps to Reduce Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in the USA|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2217/WHE.14.80|journal=Women's Health|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=193–199|doi=10.2217/whe.14.80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2016 the [[CDC Foundation]], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs (AMCHP) undertook a collaborative initiative—"Building U.S. Capacity to Review and Prevent Maternal Deaths"— funded by Merck under the Merck for Mothers program. They are reviewing maternal mortality to enhance understanding of the increase in MMR in the United States, and to identify preventative interventions.&lt;ref name="cdcfoundation_building"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdcfoundation.org/building-us-capacity-review-and-prevent-maternal-deaths |work=CDC Foundation |date=n.d. |access-date=August 4, 2018 |title=Building U.S. Capacity to Review and Prevent Maternal Deaths}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this initiative, they have created Review to Action website which hosts their reports and resources.

In their 2017 report, four states, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, and Ohio, supported the development of the Maternal Mortality Review Data System (MMRDS) which was intended as a precursor to the Maternal Mortality Review Information Application (MMRIA).&lt;ref name="cdcfoundation_criticalrole"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdcfoundation.org/sites/default/files/files/MMRIAReport.pdf |format=PDF |work=CDC Foundation |date=January 1, 2017|access-date=August 4, 2018 |title=Report from Maternal Mortality Review Committees: A View Into Their Critical Role |series=Building U.S. Capacity to Review and Prevent Maternal Deaths |pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three agencies have partnered with Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, and Utah to collect data for the Maternal Mortality Review Information Application (MMRIA). The nine states submitted their first reports in 2018.&lt;ref name="cdcfoundation_2018_Building"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.cdcfoundation.org/building-us-capacity-review-and-prevent-maternal-deaths |title=Reports from Maternal Mortality Review Committees |publisher=CDC |year=2018 |series=Building U.S. Capacity to Review and Prevent Maternal Deaths |pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After decades of inaction on the part of the U.S. Congress towards reducing MMR, the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations]] voted on June 28, 2018 to request $50 million to prevent the pregnancy-related deaths of American women.&lt;ref name="ProPublica_lostmothers_Martin_2017_Congress"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/us-senate-committee-maternal-mortality-prevention-proposal |title=U.S. Senate Committee Proposes $50 Million to Prevent Mothers Dying in Childbirth |first=Nina |last=Martin |date=June 28, 2018 |access-date=August 4, 2018 |publisher=[[ProPublica]] |series=Lost Mothers: Maternal Mortality in the U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC would receive $12 million for research and data collection. They would also support individual states in counting and reviewing data on maternal deaths.&lt;ref name="ProPublica_lostmothers_Martin_2017_Congress"/&gt; The federal [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]] would receive the remaining $38 million directed towards Healthy Start program and "life saving, evidence-based programs" at hospitals.&lt;ref name="ProPublica_lostmothers_Martin_2017_Congress"/&gt; MCHB's Healthy Start was mandated to reduce the infant mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs/healthystart/index.html |title=Healthy Start |publisher=Mchb.hrsa.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Measurement and data collection===

A widely cited 2016 study by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] statistician Marian F. MacDorman and others, reported a baseline rate of 18.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 births, which was higher than previously thought. In 2014 there was a 26.6% increase representing 23.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 births.&lt;ref name="ObstetGynecol_Chescheir_2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Drilling Down on Maternal Mortality |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |date=September 2016 |first=Nancy C. |last=Chescheir |doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000001600 |volume=128 |number=3|pages=427-8 |PMID=27500323 |url=https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Citation/2016/09000/Drilling_Down_on_Maternal_Mortality.2.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|427}} MacDorman et al. concluded that, "the maternal mortality rate for 48 states and Washington D.C. from 2000–2014 was higher than previously reported, is increasing, and places the U.S. far behind other industrialized nations."&lt;ref name=macdorman/&gt; 

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] Foundation 2018 report, 60% of maternal deaths are preventable."&lt;ref name="cdcfoundation_2018_Building"/&gt;

According to a 2016 article in ''Obstetrics and Gynecology'' by MacDorman et al, one factor affecting the US maternal death rate is the variability in calculation of maternal deaths. The WHO deems maternal deaths to be those occurring within 42 days of the end of pregnancy, whereas the United States Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System measures maternal deaths as those occurring within a year of the end of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=macdorman/&gt; Some states allow multiple responses, such as whether death occurred during pregnancy, within 42 days after pregnancy, or within a year of pregnancy, but some states, such as California, ask simply whether death occurred within a year postpartum.&lt;ref name=macdorman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacDorman|first1=Marian F.|last2=Declercq|first2=Eugene|last3=Cabral|first3=Howard|last4=Morton|first4=Christine|title=Is the United States Maternal Mortality Rate Increasing?

The gowns are pink, blue, yellow, green, and purple with various patterns.]]In their article, the authors described how data collection on maternal mortality rates became an "international embarrassment".&lt;ref name="macdorman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ObstetGynecol_Chescheir_2016" /&gt;{{rp|427}} In 2003 the national U.S. standard death certificate added a "tick box" question regarding the pregnancy status of the deceased. Many states delayed adopting the new death certificate standards. This "muddied" data and obstructed analysis of trends in maternal mortality rates. It also meant that for many years, the United States could not report a national maternal mortality rate to the [[OECD]] or other repositories that collect data internationally.&lt;ref name="macdorman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ObstetGynecol_Chescheir_2016" /&gt;{{rp|427}}

In response to the MacDorman study, revealing the "inability, or unwillingness, of states and the federal government to track maternal deaths",&lt;ref name="ProPublica_Martin" /&gt; [[ProPublica]] and [[NPR]] found that in 2016 alone, between 700 and 900 women died from pregnancy- and childbirth-related causes. In "Lost Mothers" they published stories of some of women who died. They ranged in age from 16 to 43.&lt;ref name="ProPublica_Martin"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/lost-mothers-maternal-health-died-childbirth-pregnancy|title=Lost Mothers|last1=Martin|first1=Nina|work=ProPublica|language=en |first2=Emma |last2=Cillekens |first3=Alessandra |last3=Freitas|date=July 17, 2017 |access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International USA|Amnesty International]] considers maternal mortality a healthcare crisis, based on their extensive research between 2008 and 2009. 

[[Healthy People program|Healthy People]] is a federal organization that is managed by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) at the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). In 2010, the US maternal mortality ratio was 12.7 (deaths per 100,000 live births). This was 3 times as high as the Healthy People 2010 goal, a national target set by the US government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/About-Healthy-People/How-To-Use-HealthyPeople.gov/Frequently-Asked-Questions#who|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) {{!}} Healthy People 2020|website=www.healthypeople.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2009 article in ''Anthropology News'', studies conducted by but not limited to [[Amnesty International]], the United Nations, and federal programs such as the CDC, maternal mortality has not decreased since 1999 and may have been rising.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Morton, Christine H. "Where Are the Ethnographies of US Hospital Birth?" ''Anthropology News'' 50.3 (2009): 10-11. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2017, Baltimore and Philadelphia, and New York City had established committees to "review deaths and severe complications related to pregnancy and childbirth" in their cities to prevent maternal mortality.

In the 2017 [[NPR]] and [[ProPublica]] series "Lost Mothers: Maternal Mortality in the U.S." based on a six-month long collaborative investigation, they reported that the United States has the highest rate of maternal mortality than any other developed country and it is the only country where the rate of women who die has been rising.&lt;ref name="npr_lostmothers_Martin_2017_Worst"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/528098789/u-s-has-the-worst-rate-of-maternal-deaths-in-the-developed-world |title=U.S. Has The Worst Rate Of Maternal Deaths In The Developed World |first1=Nina |last1=Martin |first2=Renee |last2=Montagne |date=May 12, 2017 |access-date=August 4, 2018 |publisher=[[ProPublica]] [[NPR]] |series=Lost Mothers: Maternal Mortality in the U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maternal mortality rate in the United States is three times higher than that in neighboring Canada&lt;ref name="npr_focus"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/527806002/focus-on-infants-during-childbirth-leaves-u-s-moms-in-danger |title=Focus On Infants During Childbirth Leaves U.S. Moms In Danger |first1=Nina |last1=Martin |first2=Renee |last2=Montagne |date=May 12, 2017 |access-date=August 4, 2018 |publisher=[[ProPublica]] [[NPR]] |series=Lost Mothers: Maternal Mortality in the U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and six times as likely to die of as Scandinavians.&lt;ref name="ProPublica_lostmothers_Martin_2017_Last"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/die-in-childbirth-maternal-death-rate-health-care-system |title=The Last Person You’d Expect to Die in Childbirth |first1=Nina |last1=Martin |first2=Renee |last2=Montagne |date=May 12, 2017 |access-date=August 4, 2018 |publisher=[[ProPublica]] |series=Lost Mothers: Maternal Mortality in the U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s the maternal mortality rate in the United Kingdom and the United States was the same—1 in 1000 pregnant and new mothers died. By 2018, the rate in the UK was three times lower than in the United States.&lt;ref name="ProPublica_Womersley_2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/why-giving-birth-is-safer-in-britain-than-in-the-u-s |title=Why Giving Birth Is Safer in Britain Than in the U.S. |first=Kate |last=Womersley  |date= August 31, 2017 |access-date=August 4, 2018 |publisher=[[ProPublica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;


According to a 2015 WHO report, in the United States the [[maternal mortality ratio|MMR]] between 1990 and 2013 "more than doubled from an estimated 12 to 28 maternal deaths per 100 000 births."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Trends in maternal mortality: 1990 to 2013.

Comparison of the US maternal death rate to the death rate in that of other countries is complicated by the lack of standardization. Some counties do not have a standard method for reporting maternal deaths and some count in statistics death only as a direct result of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medscape|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/881018#vp_2|website=www.medscape.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Amnesty International]] published a 154-page report on maternal mortality in the United States.&lt;ref name="AI_Deadly_2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Deadly Delivery: The Maternal Healthcare Crisis in the USA  |work= Amnesty International |date= March 10, 2010 |access-date= August 4, 2018 |location=London, UK |pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the United Nations described maternal mortality as a human rights issue at the forefront of American healthcare, as the mortality rates worsened over the years.&lt;ref name="AI_Deadly_2011"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/deadly-delivery-the-maternal-health-care-crisis-in-the-usa |title= Deadly Delivery: The Maternal Healthcare Crisis in the USA One Year Update 2011 |location=New York |work=Amnesty International |date=May 7, 2011 |format=PDF |access-date=August 4, 2018 |id= (pdf file: [https://www.amnestyusa.org/files/pdfs/deadlydelivery.pdf/ link]) }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Comparisons by state==
===Texas===
According to a 2017 [[BBC]] report, Texas has the highest MMR in the United States and the lowest number of people covered by health insurance.&lt;ref name="BBC_Why_2017"&gt;{{cite web |date=November 20, 2017 |publisher=[[BBC]] |title=Why do so many US women die giving birth?|series=America First?}}Video by Franz Strasser; produced by Ashley Semler and filmed by Pete Murtaugh.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of State created the [[Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force]] in 2013.

== Causes ==
[[File:Causes-pregnancy-related-death-2017_600px_1-medium.png|alt=|thumb|400x400px|This figure shows the top causes of pregnancy related deaths in the United States from 2011-2014.]]
[[Maternal death]] can be traced to [[maternal health]], which includes wellness throughout the entire pregnancy and access to basic care. In this context, the causes of maternal death can be illustrated as a continuum wherein "maternal health from wellness to morbidity to severe morbidity to death" is the cycle in which mothers often die of pregnancy related causes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

More than half of maternal deaths occur within the first 42 days after birth. According to [[Amnesty International]]'s 2010 report, five medical conditions collectively account for 74% of maternal deaths in the US. These are [[Embolism]] (20%), [[Bleeding|Hemorrhage]] (17%), [[Pre-eclampsia]] and [[eclampsia]] (16%), [[Infection]] (13%), and [[Cardiomyopathy]] (8%).&lt;ref name="AI_Deadly_2010"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Social factors and healthcare access issues also contribute to the maternal mortality rate. In no particular order, these factors include:
# [[Health care in the United States|Access to healthcare]]
#* [[Prenatal care in the United States|Prenatal care]]
#** Doctors may be unwilling or unable to provide care for pregnant mothers, due to high costs. Many women are turned down due to Medicaid fees, as well. Women have also reported access and mobility as reasons why they are unable to seek prenatal care, such as lack of transportation and/or lack of health insurance. Women who do not have access to prenatal care are 3-4 times more likely to die during or after pregnancy than women who do. Access to prenatal care is an essential component for a healthy pregnancy, which decreases the chances of maternal mortality; however, women in America do not have easy and equal access to it.
#* [[Insurance in the United States|Insurance]]
#** Insurance companies reserve the right to categorize pregnancy as a [[pre-existing condition]], thereby making women ineligible for private health insurance. Even access to [[Medicaid]] is curtailed to some women, due to bureaucracy and delays in coverage (if approved).
# [[Discrimination]]
## [[Racial disparities in health care|Racial disparity]]
##* African American women are four times as likely to suffer from [[maternal morbidity]] and [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]], compared to Caucasian or Asian or Hispanic women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and there has been no large-scale improvement over the course of 20 years to rectify these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.amnestyusa.org/themes/womens-rights/maternal-health/|title=Maternal Health – Amnesty International USA|work=Amnesty International USA|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, women of color—especially "African-American, Indigenous, Latina and immigrant women and women who did not speak English" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;—are deterred from seeking the care they need, due to discrimination.
## [[Economic inequality|Economic disparity]]
##* It is estimated that 99% of women give birth in hospitals with fees that average between $8,900-$11,400 for vaginal delivery, and between $14,900-$20,100 for a cesarean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many women cannot afford these high costs, nor can they afford private health insurance, and even waiting on government-funded care can prove to be fatal, since delays to coverage usually result in women not getting the care they need from the start.
## [[Social inequality|Social disparity]]
##* Studies have shown that women are affected by the stress of being lower income, which then affects their pregnancies and unborn babies. In the US, women of color disproportionately experience stress related to financial burdens and racism when trying to gain access to healthcare. These women have a harder time maintaining or gaining access to healthy nutrition and even safe housing. These social factors are directly linked to the outcome of maternal care.
# [[Caesarean section|Cesarean birth]]
#* The Healthy People 2010 goal was to reduce the c-section rate to 15% for low-risk first-time mothers, but that goal was not met and the rate of c-sections has been on the rise since 1996, and reached an all-time high in 2009 at 32.9% (which is double what the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] recommends between 5%-15%).{{clarify|date=July 2017|reason=It seems contradictory to say that the rate has been rising since 1996 but that the rate peaked eight years ago.}} Excessive and non-medically necessary cesareans can lead to complications that contribute to maternal mortality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# [[Postpartum period|Postpartum care]]
#* Women in the US usually meet with their physicians just once after delivery, six weeks after giving birth. Due to this long gap during the postpartum period, many health problems remain unchecked, which can result in maternal death. Just as women, especially women of color, have difficulty with access to prenatal care, the same is true for accessibility to postpartum care. Also, [[postpartum depression]] can also lead to untimely deaths for both mother and child.

Inconsistent obstetric practice (which can allow complications to progress to fatal conditions),&lt;ref name="npr_focus" /&gt; increase in women with chronic conditions, and lack of maternal health data all contribute to maternal mortality in the US. According to a 2015 WHO editorial, a nationally implemented guideline for pregnancy and childbirth, along with easy and equal access to [[antenatal]] services and care, and active participation from all 50 states to produce better maternal health data are all necessary components to reduce maternal mortality.&lt;ref name="WHO_Agrawal_2015"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/93/3/14-148627/en/|title=Maternal mortality and morbidity in the United States of America|access-date=July 26, 2017 |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=93 |date=March 2015 |number=3 |pages=133-208 |first=Priya |last=Agrawal |doi=10.2471/BLT.14.148627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent improvements in pregnancy-related health care have focused on fetuses and newborns, which has left mothers neglected in comparison.  Mothers get 6% of federal block grants in this area, and even hospitals with [[intensive care unit]]s for newborns can be unprepared for maternal complications (like having platelets on hand for bleeding).&lt;ref name="npr_focus" /&gt; A significant proportion of physicians in maternal-fetal medicine programs are able to complete a program in without ever attending a labor.&lt;ref name="npr_focus" /&gt;

== Prevention ==
[[Hospital Corporation of America|The Hospital Corporation of America]] has found that a uniform guideline for birth can improve maternal care, thereby reducing the amount of "lower maternal and fetal injury, fewer c-sections and reduced litigation." However, no such mandated guideline currently exists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To prevent maternal mortality moving forward, Amnesty International suggests these steps:
# Increase government accountability and coordination
# Create a national registry for maternal and infant health data, while incorporating intersections of gender, race, and social/economic factors
# Improve maternity care workforce
# Improve diversity in maternity care

According to the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[National Center for Health Statistics]], out-of-hospital births (such as home births and birthing centers with [[midwifery]] assistance)  "generally provided a lower risk profile than hospital births." &lt;ref&gt;MacDorman, Marian F., T. J. Mathews, Eugene R. Declercq, and National Center for Health Statistics , Issuing Body. ''Trends in Out-of-hospital Births in the United States, 1990-2012''. NCHS Data Brief (Series) ; No. 144. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procedures such as [[Episiotomy|Episiotomies]] and cesareans, while helpful in some cases, when administered unnecessarily increase the risk of maternal death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Midwifery and [[Obstetrics|mainstream obstetric care]] can be complementary,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which is commonly the case in [[Canada]], where women have a wide arrange of [[pregnancy]] and [[Childbirth|birthing]] options, wherein [[Informed consent|informed choice and consent]] are fundamental tenants of their reformed maternity care.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Margaret. Chapter 4, ''At Work in the Field of Birth''. 2007. Vanderbilt University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The maternal mortality rate is twice as low in Canada than the United States, according to a [[World|global]] survey conducted by the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pregnancy-idUSKCN0T10LO20151112|title=U.S. maternal mortality rate is twice that of Canada: U.N|date= 2015-11-12|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK has had success drastically reducing preeclampsia deaths by implementing a nationwide standard protocol.&lt;ref name="npr_focus" /&gt;

[[Gender-bias in medical diagnosis|Gender bias]] and obstetric violence in the medical field are also important factors when discussing maternal wellness, care, and death in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Tello, Farah.

'''Milieu therapy''' is a form of [[psychotherapy]] that involves the use of [[therapeutic community|therapeutic communities]]. Patients join a group of around 30, for between 9 and 18 months. During their stay, patients are encouraged to take responsibility for themselves and the others within the unit, based upon a hierarchy of collective consequences. Patients are expected to hold one another to following rules, with more senior patients expected to [[Modeling (psychology)|model]] appropriate behavior for newer patients. If one patient violates the rules, others who were aware of the violation but did not intervene may also be punished to varying extents based upon their involvement. Milieu therapy is thought to be of value in treating [[personality disorders]] and [[behavioural problems]], and can also be used with a goal of stimulating the patient's remaining cognitive-communicative abilities. Organizations known to use milieu therapy include [[Henderson Hospital]], in [[London]], [[Forest Heights Lodge]] in Evergreen, CO,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cameron, A |title=Crash Course Psychiatry |publisher=Mosby |year=2004 |edition=2nd |isbn=0-7234-3340-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestheightslodge.org/the-milieu.html|title=The Milieu|work=Forest Heights Lodge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|United States Veteran's Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=VA Palo Alto Health Care System |title=Substance Use/Homeless Rehabilitation Emphasis Area Training |url=http://www.paloalto.va.gov/docs/MentalHealth/PsychologyTraining/Substance_Abuse_Homeless_Rehab_Emphasis_Area.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIEHS National Toxicology Program's Office of the Report on [[Carcinogens]], directed by Dr. Ruth Lunn, Dr.P.H., is responsible for publishing the Report On Carcinogens; with the current year 2011 Report included, there have been 12 editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niehs.nih.gov/about/od/ontp/roc/index.cfm Report on Carcinogens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623122701/http://www.niehs.nih.gov/about/od/ontp/roc/index.cfm |date=2011-06-23 }}, NIEHS National Toxicology Program&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The program was established in 1978 by Joseph A. Califano, Jr., then the [[United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (today known as the Secretary of Health and Human Services).  The program arose from congressional concerns about the health effects of chemical agents in the environment. In October 1981, Secretary Richard S. Schwiker granted permanent status to the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/?objectid=720163C9-BDB7-CEBA-FE4B970B9E72BF54|title=History of the NTP - National Toxicology Program|publisher=National Toxicology Program|accessdate=15 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016021624/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/?objectid=720163C9-BDB7-CEBA-FE4B970B9E72BF54|archivedate=16 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interagency Center for Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods==
The NTP Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) supports the development and evaluation of new, revised, and alternative methods for chemical safety testing. [[Alternatives to animal testing|Alternative methods]] are methods for safety testing of chemicals and chemical products that use fewer or no animals or that minimize or prevent animal pain and distress. NICEATM is directed by Dr. Warren Casey, PhD, DABT.

The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 &lt;ref&gt;NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-43, codified at 42 U.S.C. 285l-1 and 42 U.S.C. 283e)&lt;/ref&gt; directed NIEHS to establish criteria for the validation and regulatory acceptance of alternative test methods and a process for their subsequent implementation. This led to the establishment of the [[Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods]] via the ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000,&lt;ref&gt;ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-545, codified at 42 U.S.C. 285l-3)&lt;/ref&gt; which stated that ICCVAM would exist as a permanent interagency committee of NIEHS under NICEATM.

In addition to supporting ICCVAM, NICEATM activities include:
* Conducting and publishing analyses and evaluations of data from new, revised, and alternative testing approaches
* Providing information to test method developers, regulators, and regulated industry through its website and other communications and by organizing workshops and symposia on topics of interest
* Providing bioinformatics and computational toxicology support to National Toxicology Program and NIEHS projects, especially those related to Tox21
NICEATM publishes results of its analyses of alternative test methods and approaches in the peer-reviewed literature and presents at meetings of the [[Society of Toxicology]] and the World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8981">'''Neurogastronomy''' is the study of [[flavor]] [[perception]] and the ways it affects [[cognition]] and [[memory]]. This [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field is influenced by the [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]] of [[Sensation (psychology)|sensation]], [[learning]], [[Hunger (motivational state)|satiety]], and [[Decision-making|decision making]]. Areas of interest include how [[olfaction]] contributes to flavor, [[food addiction]] and [[obesity]], taste preferences, and the linguistics of communicating and identifying flavor. The term neurogastronomy was coined by neuroscientist [[Gordon M. Shepherd]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/882238865|title=Neurogastronomy : how the brain creates flavor and why it matters|last=1933-|first=Shepherd, Gordon M.,|isbn=9780231159111|oclc=882238865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Olfaction and flavor ==
[[File:Olfactory system.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Human olfactory system. 1:{{nbsp}}[[Olfactory bulb]] 2:{{nbsp}}[[Mitral cells]] 3:{{nbsp}}[[Bone]] 4:{{nbsp}}Nasal [[epithelium]] 5:{{nbsp}}[[Glomerulus (olfaction)|Glomerulus]] 6:{{nbsp}}[[Olfactory receptor neuron]]s]]
Out of all the sensory modalities, olfaction contributes most to the sensation and perception of flavor processing.  Olfaction has two sensory modalities, [[orthonasal smell]], the detection of odor molecules originating outside the body, and [[retronasal smell]], the detection of odor molecules originating during [[mastication]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rozin|first=Paul|date=1982|title="Taste-smell confusions" and the duality of the olfactory sense|url=|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|volume=31|pages=397–401}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is retronasal smell, whose sensation is felt in the mouth, that contributes to flavor perception.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Anthropologically, over human evolution, the shortening of the [[Pharynx|nasopharynx]] and other shifts in bone structure suggest a constant improvement of flavor perception capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After mastication, odor molecules travel through the back of the mouth and up the nasopharynx.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Aroma compound|odorants]] are detected by myriad receptors on the [[olfactory epithelium]]. These receptors respond to a variety of dimensions of chemical properties. Odor receptors that respond to a dimension within a molecular receptive range are aggregated by [[Glomerulus|glomeruli]] in the [[olfactory bulb]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/844328507|title=The senses a comprehensive reference|last=I.|first=Basbaum, Allan|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780126394825|oclc=844328507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the multi-dimensional nature of odorant stimuli is reduced to two dimensions. This input undergoes [[edge enhancement]], increasing its [[signal-to-noise ratio]] by way of [[lateral inhibition]] due to [[mitral cells]] stemming from the glomerular layer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This input then reaches the olfactory cortex. Here, [[Hebbian LTP|Hebbian]] learning networks allow for recall with partial or weak stimuli, indicating the first stage of [[Consciousness|conscious]] perception.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Here, connections with the [[hypothalamus]] and [[hippocampus]] indicate that olfaction stimuli affect emotion, decision making, and learning only after significant processing and rudimentary identification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Decision making ==
The hedonic value of food and its decision making relies on several concurrent neural processings. The attentional drive to seek and consume food is modulated by [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] signaling of hunger and satiety. Habit, social interactions, and nutritional needs affect this signaling. Analysis of non-human primates' [[orbitofrontal cortex]] suggests decision making is additionally modulated by food identification, independent of hunger. Activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior singulate]] suggest that an [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] value is assigned to every food identification. Hedonic pleasure increases when engaging with food consumption and peaks during satiety. Impairments in these systems greatly impact the ability to resist the urge to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kringelbach|first=Morten L.|date=2015-03-02|title=The pleasure of food: underlying brain mechanisms of eating and other pleasures|url=https://flavourjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13411-014-0029-2|journal=Flavour|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|pages=20|doi=10.1186/s13411-014-0029-2|issn=2044-7248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging studies show that [[Obesity|obese]] subjects with impairment in dopamine circuits that regulate hedonic value have issues with reward sensitivity and resist functional homeostatic signals that normally would prevent [[overeating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volkow|first=Nora D.|last2=Wang|first2=Gene-Jack|last3=Baler|first3=Ruben D.|date=2011-01-01|title=Reward, dopamine and the control of food intake: implications for obesity|url=http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(10)00247-0|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=English|volume=15|issue=1|pages=37–46|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.11.001|issn=1364-6613|pmc=3124340|pmid=21109477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consumption of [[comfort food]]s can facilitate feelings of relational connection and belonging, and the motivation behind pursuing certain foods can be modulated by social context and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Troisi|first=Jordan D.|last2=Gabriel|first2=Shira|last3=Derrick|first3=Jaye L.|last4=Geisler|first4=Alyssa|date=2015-07-01|title=Threatened belonging and preference for comfort food among the securely attached|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666315000768|journal=Appetite|volume=90|pages=58–64|doi=10.1016/j.appet.2015.02.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the consumption of [[Pungency|spicy]] food can cause pain, people in many cultures ascribe a high hedonic value to it. Psychologist [[Paul Rozin]] puts forth the idea of "benign masochism", a learned tendency that overrides the typically aversive stimuli because of the risk-taking or thrill-seeking associated with overcoming pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/31037243|title=22nd APS Annual Convention (2010) - Presidential Symposium - Paul Rozin|website=Vimeo|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Learned flavor preferences ==
Learned taste preferences as early as [[in utero]], where the [[fetus]] is exposed to flavors through [[amniotic fluid]]. Early, innate, preferences exhibit tendencies towards calorie and protein dense foods. As children grow older, more factors such as peers, repeated exposures, environments and food availability will modulate taste preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ventura|first=Alison K.|last2=Worobey|first2=John|date=2013-05-06|title=Early Influences on the Development of Food Preferences|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S096098221300208X|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=23|issue=9|pages=R401–R408|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2013.02.037|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Describing odors ==
While naming a flavor or food refines its representation strengthens its recall in memory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956771635|title=Learning to Smell Olfactory Perception from Neurobiology to Behavior|last=J.|first=Stevenson, Richard|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=9780801888946|oclc=956771635}}&lt;/ref&gt; the patterns and tendencies in word choice to describe flavor suggests limits to the our perception and communication.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brochet|first=Frédéric|last2=Dubourdieu|first2=Denis|date=2001-05-01|title=Wine Descriptive Language Supports Cognitive Specificity of Chemical Senses|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X00924283|journal=Brain and Language|volume=77|issue=2|pages=187–196|doi=10.1006/brln.2000.2428}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the flavor of wine, tasters tend to use words that function as a combination of visual and texture descriptors, and references to objects with similar odorant profiles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Color perception heavily influences the word choice describing a flavor; the color of word's semantic reference is often congruent with the food's color when the taster can see the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morrot|first=Gil|last2=Brochet|first2=Frédéric|last3=Dubourdieu|first3=Denis|date=2001-11-01|title=The Color of Odors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X01924939|journal=Brain and Language|volume=79|issue=2|pages=309–320|doi=10.1006/brln.2001.2493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychiatry in Russia and the USSR}}
[[File:Serbskij-institute.jpg|thumb|The Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, also briefly called the [[Serbsky Institute]] (the part of its building in [[Moscow]])]]

There was systematic [[political abuse of psychiatry]] in the [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BMA|1992|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|Finckenauer|1995|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Gershman|1984}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=490}}; {{harvnb|Knapp|2007|p=406}}; {{harvnb|Kutchins|Kirk|1997|p=293}}; {{harvnb|Lisle|2010|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Merskey|1978}}; {{harvnb|Society for International Development|1984|p=19}}; {{harvs|txt|author=US GPO|year1=1972|year2=1975|year3=1976|year4=1984|year5=1988}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2002|year2=2010a|year3=2013a}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the interpretation of political opposition or dissent as a psychiatric problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=425}}; {{harvnb|UPA Herald|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was called "psychopathological mechanisms" of dissent.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}}

During the leadership of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]], psychiatry was used to disable and remove from society political opponents ("dissidents") who openly expressed beliefs that contradicted the official dogma.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=17}}&lt;ref&gt;See Vladimir Bukovsky, ''Judgment in Moscow'' (forthcoming spring 2016), Chapter 3, Back to the Future: "Deportation or the Madhouse",&lt;/ref&gt; The term "philosophical intoxication", for instance, was widely applied to the mental disorders diagnosed when people disagreed with the country's Communist leaders and, by referring to the writings of the Founding Fathers of Marxism–Leninism—[[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]]—made them the target of criticism.{{sfn|Korolenko|Dmitrieva|2000|p=15}}

[[Article 58]]-10 of the Stalin-era Criminal Code, "[[Anti-Soviet agitation]]", was to a considerable degree preserved in the new 1958 RSFSR Criminal Code as [[anti-Soviet agitation|Article 70]] "Anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda". In 1967, a weaker law, Article 190-1 "Dissemination of fabrications known to be false, which defame the Soviet political and social system", was added to the RSFSR Criminal Code. These laws were frequently applied in conjunction with the system of diagnosis for mental illness, developed by Academician [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]]. Together they established a framework within which non-standard beliefs could easily be defined as a criminal offence and the basis, subsequently, for a psychiatric diagnosis.{{sfn|Kovalyov|2007}}

== Applying the diagnosis ==
The "anti-Soviet" political behavior of some individuals — being outspoken in their opposition to the authorities, demonstrating for reform, and writing critical books — were defined simultaneously as criminal acts (e.g., a violation of Articles 70 or 190-1), symptoms of mental illness (e.g., "delusion of reformism"), and susceptible to a ready-made diagnosis (e.g., "[[sluggish schizophrenia]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|US Delegation Report|1989|p=26}}; {{harvnb|US Delegation Report (Russian translation)|2009|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the boundaries of the diagnostic category, the symptoms of pessimism, poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia."{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}

The psychiatric incarceration of certain individuals was prompted by their attempts to emigrate, to distribute or possess prohibited documents or books, to participate in civil rights protests and demonstrations, and become involved in forbidden religious activities.{{sfn|Chodoff|1985}} The religious beliefs of prisoners, including those of well-educated former atheists who had become adherents of a religious faith, was considered to be a form of mental illness that required treatment.{{sfn|Pospielovsky|1988|pp=36, 140, 156, 178–181}} The [[KGB]] routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds.{{sfn|Murray|1983}} Highly classified government documents which have become available after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] confirm that the authorities consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gluzman|year1=2009a|year2=2013a}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2013a|p=8}}; {{harvnb|Fedenko|2009}}; see some documents in {{harvnb|Pozharov|1999}}; {{harvnb|Soviet Archives|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "Commentary" to the post-Soviet ''Russian Federation Law on Psychiatric Care'', individuals forced to undergo treatment in Soviet psychiatric medical institutions were entitled to rehabilitation in accordance with the established procedure and could claim compensation. The [[Russian Federation]] acknowledged that before 1991 psychiatry had been used for political purposes and took responsibility for the victims of "political psychiatry."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dmitrieva|2002}}; {{harvnb|Pshizov|2006|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[political abuse of psychiatry in Russia]] has continued, nevertheless, since the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2013a|pp=16–18}}; {{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights activists may still face the threat of a psychiatric diagnosis for their legitimate civic and political activities.{{sfn|NPZ|2005}}

== Background ==

=== Definitions ===
{{Repression in the Soviet Union}}
Political abuse of psychiatry is the misuse of psychiatric diagnosis, detention and treatment for the purposes of obstructing the fundamental human rights of certain groups and individuals in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2010a}}; {{harvnb|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; It entails the [[exculpation]] and committal of citizens to psychiatric facilities based upon political rather than mental health-based criteria.&lt;ref name=Gluzman&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gluzman|year1=2009b|year2=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors, including psychiatrists, also use the terms "Soviet political psychiatry"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abouelleil|Bingham|2014}}; {{harvnb|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=189}}; {{harvnb|Kadarkay|1982|p=205}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=260}}; {{harvnb|Laqueur|1980|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Munro|2002a|p=179}}; {{harvnb|Pietikäinen|2015|p=280}}; {{harvnb|Rejali|2009|p=395}}; {{harvnb|Smythies|1973}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Voren|year1=2010b|loc1=p. 95|year2=2013b}}; {{harvnb|Working Group on the Internment of Dissenters in Mental Hospitals|1983|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "punitive psychiatry" to refer to this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adler|Gluzman|1993}}; {{harvnb|Amnesty International|1991|pp=9, 64}}; {{harvnb|Ball|Farr|1984|p=258}};  {{harvnb|Bebtschuk|Smirnova|Khayretdinov|2012}}; {{harvnb|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|pp=292, 293, 294}}; {{harvnb|Dmitrieva|2001|pp=84, 108}}; {{harvnb|Faraone|1982}}; {{harvnb|Fedor|2011|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Ghodse|2011|p=422}}; {{harvnb|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Gushansky|2005|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Horvath|2014}}; {{harvnb|Joffe|1984}}; {{harvnb|Kekelidze|2013b}}; {{harvnb|Khvorostianov|Elias|2015}}; {{harvnb|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|pp=7, 47, 60, 67, 77, 259, 291}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Koryagin|year1=1988||year2=1989}}; {{harvnb|Kovalyov|2007}}; {{harvnb|Leontev|2010}}; {{harvnb|Magalif|2010}}; {{harvnb|Podrabinek|1980|pp=10, 57, 136}}; {{harvnb|Pukhovsky|2001|pp=243, 252}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Savenko|year1=2005a|year2=2005b}}; {{harvnb|Schmidt|Shchurko|2014}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Szasz|year1=2004|year2=2006}}; {{harvnb|US Delegation Report|1989|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Vitaliev|1991|p=148}}; {{harvnb|Voren|Bloch|1989|pp=92, 95, 98}}; {{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Zile|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Punitive Medicine'' (1979) [[Alexander Podrabinek]] defined the term "punitive medicine", which is identified with "punitive psychiatry," as "a tool in the struggle against dissidents who cannot be punished by legal means."{{sfn|Podrabinek|1980|p=63}} Punitive psychiatry is neither a discrete subject nor a psychiatric specialty but, rather, it is an emergency arising within many applied sciences in totalitarian countries where members of a profession may feel themselves compelled to serve the diktats of power.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a}} Psychiatric confinement of sane people is uniformly considered a particularly pernicious form of repression&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonnie|2002}}; {{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Faraone|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soviet punitive psychiatry was one of the key weapons of both illegal and legal repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|Green|1997|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Alexéyeff|1976}}; {{harvnb|US GPO|1984|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] and [[Semyon Gluzman]] wrote in their joint ''A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissenters'', "the Soviet use of psychiatry as a punitive means is based upon the deliberate interpretation of dissent... as a psychiatric problem."{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=425}}

=== An inherent capacity for abuse ===

Psychiatry possesses an inherent capacity for abuse that is greater than in other areas of medicine.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both in the interest of the detainee and in the broader interests of society.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}} In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive.{{sfn|Malterud|Hunskaar|2002|p=94}} In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=65}}

In the period from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to have been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as [[Communist Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|BMA|1992|p=66}} The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community.{{sfn|Lyons|O'Malley|2002}} Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience.{{sfn|Semple|Smyth|2013|p=6}} As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease.{{sfn|Metzl|2010|p=14}} In many countries, political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.{{sfn|Noll|2007|p=3}}

In the Soviet Union, [[dissident]]s were often confined in the so-called ''[[psikhushka]]'', or psychiatric wards.{{sfn|Matvejević|2004|p=32}} ''Psikhushka'' is the [[Russian language|Russian]] ironic diminutive for "mental hospital".{{sfn|Hunt|1998|p=xii}} One of the first ''psikhushkas'' was the Psychiatric Prison Hospital in the city of [[Kazan]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Chronicle of Current Events'' No 10, 31 October 1969 — 10.10 "The Kazan Special Psychiatric Hospital".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, it was transferred to the control of the [[NKVD]] (the secret police and precursor of the [[KGB]]) on the orders of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], the head of the NKVD.{{sfn|Birstein|2004}} International [[human rights defenders]] such as [[Walter Reich]] have long recorded the methods by which Soviet psychiatrists in ''Psikhushka'' hospitals diagnosed [[schizophrenia]] in political dissenters.{{sfn|Metzl|2010|p=14}} Western scholars examined no aspect of Soviet psychiatry as thoroughly as its involvement in the social control of political dissenters.{{sfn|Brintlinger|Vinitsky|2007|p=292}}

=== Under Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev ===

As early as 1948, the Soviet secret service took an interest in this area of medicine.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} One of those with overall responsibility for the [[Soviet secret police]], pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], was the first to order the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=495}} Russian psychiatrist [[Pyotr Gannushkin]] also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vasilenko|2004|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Chernosvitov|2002|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime.{{sfn|Keukens|Voren|2007}}

Punitive psychiatry was not simply an inheritance from the Stalin era, however, according to Alexander Etkind. The [[GULag]], or Chief Administration for Corrective Labor Camps, was an effective instrument of political repression. There was no compelling requirement to develop an alternative and more expensive psychiatric substitute.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}} The abuse of psychiatry was a natural product of the later Soviet era.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}} From the mid-1970s to the 1990s, the structure of the USSR mental health service conformed to the double standard in society, being represented by two distinct systems which co-existed peacefully for the most part, despite periodic conflicts between them:
# system one was that of punitive psychiatry. It directly served the authorities and those in power, and was headed by the [[Serbsky Institute|Moscow Institute for Forensic Psychiatry]] named in honour of [[Vladimir Serbsky]];
# system two was made up of elite, psychotherapeutically oriented clinics. It was headed by the [[Bekhterev Psychoneurological Institute|Leningrad Psychoneurological Institute]] named in memory of [[Vladimir Bekhterev]].{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}
The hundreds of hospitals in the provinces combined elements of both systems.{{sfn|Grigorenko|Ruzgis|Sternberg|1997|p=72}}

If someone was mentally ill then, he was sent to a psychiatric hospital and confined there until his dying day.{{sfn|Demina|2008}} If his mental health was uncertain but he was not constantly unwell, he and his ''kharakteristika'' [testimonial from employers, the Party and other Soviet institutions] were sent to a labour camp or to be shot.{{sfn|Demina|2008}} When allusions to [[socialist legality]] started to be made, it was decided to prosecute such people.{{sfn|Demina|2008}} Soon it became apparent that putting people who gave anti-Soviet speeches on trial only made matters worse for the regime. Such individuals were no longer tried in court. Instead they were given a psychiatric examination and declared insane.{{sfn|Demina|2008}}

== The Joint Session, October 1951 ==
{{main|Pavlovian session}}
In the 1950s, the psychiatrists of the Soviet Union turned themselves into the medical arm of the Gulag State.{{sfn|Lakritz|2009}} A precursor of later abuses in psychiatry in the Soviet Union, the "Joint Session" of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]] and the Board of the All-Union Neurological and Psychiatric Association took place from 10 to 15 October 1951. The event was dedicated, supposedly, to the great Russian physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] and alleged that several of the USSR's leading neuroscientists and psychiatrists of the time (among them [[Grunya Sukhareva]], [[Vasily Gilyarovsky]], [[Raisa Golant]], [[Aleksandr Shmaryan]], and [[Mikhail Gurevich (psychiatrist)|Mikhail Gurevich]]) were guilty of practicing "anti-Pavlovian, anti-Marxist, idealistic [and] reactionary" science, and this was damaging to Soviet psychiatry.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}}

During the Joint Session, these eminent psychiatrists, motivated by fear, had to publicly admit that their scientific positions were erroneous and they also had to promise to conform to "Pavlovian" doctrines.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} These public declarations of obedience proved insufficient. In the closing speech [[Snezhnevsky]], the lead author of the Session's policy report, stated that the accused psychiatrists "have not disarmed themselves and continue to remain in the old anti-Pavlovian positions", thereby causing "grave damage to the Soviet psychiatric research and practice". The vice president of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences accused them of "diligently worshipping the dirty source of American pseudo-science".{{sfn|Savenko|2009a}} Those who articulated these accusations at the Joint Session — among them [[Irina Strelchuk]], [[Vasily Banshchikov]], [[Oleg Kerbikov]], and Snezhnevsky — were distinguished by their careerist ambition and fear for their own positions.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} Not surprisingly, many of them were promoted and appointed to leadership posts shortly after the session.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}}

The Joint Session also had a negative impact on several leading Soviet academic neuroscientists, such as [[Pyotr Anokhin]], [[Aleksey Speransky]], [[Lina Stern]], [[Ivan Beritashvili]], and [[Leon Orbeli]]. They were labeled as anti-Pavlovians, anti-materialists and reactionaries and subsequently they were dismissed from their positions.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} In addition to losing their laboratories some of these scientists were subjected to torture in prison.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} The Moscow, Leningrad, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian schools of neuroscience and neurophysiology were damaged for a period due to this loss of personnel.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} The Joint Session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry for years to come.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}} Pseudo-science took control.{{sfn|Lavretsky|1998|p=540}}

Following a previous joint session of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (28 June–4 July 1950) and the 10-15 October 1951 joint session of the Presidium of the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Board of the All-Union Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists, Snezhnevky's schoolthe was given the leading role.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=101}} The 1950 decision to give monopoly over psychiatry to the Pavlovian school of Snezhnevsky was one of the crucial factors in the rise of political psychiatry.{{sfn|Helmchen|Sartorius|2010|p=494}} The Soviet doctors, under the incentive of Snezhnevsky, devised a "Pavlovian theory of schizophrenia" and increasingly applied this diagnostic category to political dissidents.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=30}}

== "Sluggish schizophrenia" ==
{{main|Sluggish schizophrenia}}
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:30%; float:right; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;"The incarceration of free thinking healthy people in madhouses is spiritual murder, it is a variation of the gas chamber, even more cruel; the torture of the people being killed is more malicious and more prolonged. Like the gas chambers, these crimes will never be forgotten and those involved in them will be condemned for all time during their life and after their death."{{sfn|Sagan|Jonsen|1976}} &lt;small&gt;([[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Psychiatric diagnoses such as the diagnosis of "[[sluggish schizophrenia]]" in political dissidents in the USSR were used for political purposes.{{sfn|Katona|Robertson|2005|p=77}} It was the diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia" that was most prominently used in cases of dissidents.{{sfn|Reich|1983}} Sluggish schizophrenia as one of the new diagnostic categories was created to facilitate the stifling of dissidents and was a root of self-deception among psychiatrists to placate their consciences when the doctors acted as a tool of oppression in the name of a political system.{{sfn|Tobin|2013}} According to the [[Global Initiative on Psychiatry]] chief executive [[Robert van Voren]], the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR arose from the conception that people who opposed the Soviet regime were mentally sick since there was no other logical rationale why one would oppose the sociopolitical system considered the best in the world.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} The diagnosis "sluggish schizophrenia," a longstanding concept further developed by the Moscow School of Psychiatry and particularly by its chief Snezhnevsky, furnished a very handy framework for explaining this behavior.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}}

The weight of scholarly opinion holds that the psychiatrists who played the primary role in the development of this diagnostic concept were following directives from the [[Communist Party]] and the Soviet secret service, or [[KGB]], and were well aware of the political uses to which it would be put. Nevertheless, for many Soviet psychiatrists "sluggish schizophrenia" appeared to be a logical explanation to apply to the behavior of critics of the regime who, in their opposition, seemed willing to jeopardize their happiness, family, and career for a reformist conviction or ideal that was so apparently divergent from the prevailing social and political orthodoxy.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}}

Snezhnevsky, the most prominent theorist of Soviet psychiatry and director of the Institute of Psychiatry of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, developed a novel [[classification of mental disorders]] postulating an original set of diagnostic criteria.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} A carefully crafted description of sluggish schizophrenia established that psychotic symptoms were non-essential for the diagnosis, but symptoms of [[psychopathy]], [[hypochondria]], [[depersonalization]] or [[anxiety]] were central to it.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Symptoms referred to as part of the "negative axis" included [[pessimism]], poor [[social adaptation]], and conflict with authorities, and were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia with scanty symptoms."{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} According to Snezhnevsky, patients with sluggish schizophrenia could present as quasi sane yet manifest minimal but clinically relevant personality changes which could remain unnoticed to the untrained eye.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Thereby patients with non-psychotic mental disorders, or even persons who were not mentally sick, could be easily labelled with the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Along with [[paranoia]], sluggish schizophrenia was the diagnosis most frequently used for the psychiatric incarceration of dissenters.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} As per the theories of Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, schizophrenia was much more prevalent than previously considered since the illness could be presented with comparatively slight symptoms and only progress afterwards.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} As a consequence, schizophrenia was diagnosed much more often in Moscow than in cities of other countries, as ''the World Health Organization Pilot Study on Schizophrenia'' reported in 1973.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} The city with the highest prevalence of schizophrenia in the world was Moscow.{{sfn|Park|Park|Jun|Kim|2014}} In particular, the scope was widened by sluggish schizophrenia because according to Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, patients with this diagnosis were capable of functioning almost normally in the social sense.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} Their symptoms could be like those of a neurosis or could assume a paranoid character.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} The patients with paranoid symptoms retained some insight into their condition but overestimated their own significance and could manifest grandiose ideas of reforming society.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} Thereby, sluggish schizophrenia could have such symptoms as "reform delusions," "perseverance," and "struggle for the truth."{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} As [[Viktor Styazhkin]] reported, Snezhnevsky diagnosed a reformation delusion for every case when a patient "develops a new principle of human knowledge, drafts an academy of human happiness, and many other projects for the benefit of mankind."{{sfn|Styazhkin|1992|p=66}}

In the 1960s and 1970s, theories, which contained ideas about reforming society and struggling for truth, and religious convictions were not referred to delusional paranoid disorders in practically all foreign classifications, but Soviet psychiatry, proceeding from ideological conceptions, referred critique of the political system and proposals to reform this system to the delusional construct.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=19}} Diagnostic approaches of conception of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoiac states with delusion of reformism were used only in the Soviet Union and several [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European countries]].{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=18}}

On the covert orders of the [[KGB]], thousands of social and political reformers—Soviet "dissidents"—were incarcerated in mental hospitals after being labelled with diagnoses of "sluggish schizophrenia", a disease fabricated by Snezhnevsky and "Moscow school" of psychiatry.{{sfn|Healey|2011}} American psychiatrist [[Alan A. Stone]] stated that Western criticism of Soviet psychiatry aimed at Snezhnevsky personally, because he was essentially responsible for the Soviet concept of schizophrenia with a "sluggish type" manifestation by "reformerism" including other symptoms.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=8}} One can readily apply this diagnostic scheme to dissenters.{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=8}} Snezhnevsky was long attacked in the West as an exemplar of psychiatric abuse in the USSR.{{sfn|Reich|1983}} The leading critics implied that Snezhnevsky had designed the Soviet model of schizophrenia and this diagnosis to make political dissent into a mental disease.{{sfn|Stone|2002}} He was charged with cynically developing a system of diagnosis which could be bent for political purposes, and he himself diagnosed or was involved in a series of famous dissident cases,{{sfn|Reich|1983}} and, in dozens of cases, he personally signed a commission decision on legal insanity of mentally healthy dissidents including [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]], [[Leonid Plyushch]], [[:uk:Плахотнюк Микола Григорович|Mikola Plakhotnyuk]],{{sfn|Gluzman|2013c}} and [[Pyotr Grigorenko]].{{sfn|Stone|1985|p=11}}

== Beginning of the trend toward mass abuse ==

=== From Khrushchev to Andropov ===
The campaign to declare political opponents mentally sick and to commit dissenters to mental hospitals began in the late 1950s and early 1960s.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} As [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] commented on the emergence of the political abuse of psychiatry,&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Boukovsky, ''Jugement a Moscou'', Robert Laffont: Paris, 1996, "Le Goulag psychiatrique", p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikita Khrushchev]] reckoned that it was impossible for people in a socialist society to have an anti-socialist consciousness. Whenever manifestations of dissidence could not be justified as a provocation of world imperialism or a legacy of the past, they were self-evidently the product of mental disease.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} In a speech published in the  ''[[Pravda]]'' daily newspaper on 24 May 1959, Khrushchev said:
{{quote|A crime is a deviation from generally recognized standards of behavior frequently caused by mental disorder. Can there be diseases, nervous disorders among certain people in a Communist society? Evidently yes. If that is so, then there will also be offences, which are characteristic of people with abnormal minds. Of those who might start calling for opposition to Communism on this basis, we can say that clearly their mental state is not normal.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}}}}

[[File:RIAN archive 101740 Yury Andropov, Chairman of KGB.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yuri Andropov]] (1914–1984), a [[KGB Chairman]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the CPSU]]]]
The now available evidence supports the conclusion that the system of political abuse of psychiatry was carefully designed by the KGB to rid the USSR of undesirable elements.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=4}} According to several available documents and a message by a former general of the Fifth (dissident) Directorate of the Ukrainian KGB to Robert van Voren, political abuse of psychiatry as a systematic method of repression was developed by Yuri Andropov along with a selected group of associates.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=8}}

Andropov was in charge of the wide-ranging deployment of psychiatric repression from the moment he was appointed to head the KGB.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|pp=187–188}} He became [[KGB Chairman]] on 18 May 1967.{{sfn|Rhoer|1983|p=52}} On 3 July 1967, he made a proposal to establish a Fifth Directorate (ideological counterintelligence) within the KGB to deal with internal political opposition to the Soviet regime.{{sfn|Nuti|2009|p=29}}{{sfn|Albats|1995|p=177}} The Directorate was set up at the end of July and took charge of KGB files on all Soviet dissidents, including [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]].{{sfn|Nuti|2009|p=29}} In 1968, KGB Chairman Andropov issued a departmental order "On the tasks of State security agencies in combating the ideological sabotage by the adversary", calling for the KGB to struggle against dissidents and their imperialist masters.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|1999|p=7}} His aim was "the destruction of dissent in all its forms" and he insisted that the positions of the capitalist countries on human rights, and their criticisms of the Soviet Union and its own politics of human rights from these positions, was just one part of a wide-ranging imperialist plot to undermine the Soviet state's foundation.{{sfn|Andrew|Mitrokhin|1999|p=7}} Similar ideas can be found in the 1983 book ''Speeches and Writings'' by Andropov published when he had become General Secretary of the CPSU:{{sfn|Lambelet|1989}}
{{quote|[w]hen analyzing the main trend in present-day bourgeois criticism of [Soviet] human rights policies one is bound to draw the conclusion that although this criticism is camouflaged with "concern" for freedom, democracy, and human rights, it is directed in fact against the socialist essence of Soviet society...}}

=== Implementation and the legal framework ===
On 29 April 1969, Andropov submitted an elaborate plan to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]  to set up a network of mental hospitals that would defend the "Soviet Government and the socialist order" from dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albats|1995|p=177}}{{harvnb|Luty|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To persuade his fellow Politburo members of the risk posed by the mentally ill, Andropov circulated a report from the Krasnodar Region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/22-january-1970-pb-151xiii/ The Bukovsky Archives, 22 January 1970 (Pb 151/XIII).]&lt;/ref&gt; A secret resolution of the [[USSR Council of Ministers]] was adopted.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=176}} Andropov's proposal to use psychiatry for struggle against dissenters was adopted and implemented.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=42}}

In 1929, the USSR had 70 psychiatric hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935, this had increased to 102 psychiatric hospitals and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric beds in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tiganov|1999|p=333}} The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974, the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/22-february-1972-st-3119/ The Bukovsky Archives, 22 February 1972 (St 31/19).]&lt;/ref&gt; Such an expansion in the number of psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=47}} Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=47}}

On 15 May 1969, a Soviet Government decree (No. 345–209) was issued "On measures for preventing dangerous behavior (acts) on the part of mentally ill persons."{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} This decree confirmed the practice of having undesirables hauled into detention by psychiatrists.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} Soviet psychiatrists were told whom they should examine and were assured that they might detain these individuals with the help of the police or entrap them into coming to the hospital.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} The psychiatrists thereby doubled as interrogators and as arresting officers.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}} Doctors fabricated a diagnosis requiring detention and no court decision was required for subjecting the individual to indefinite confinement in a psychiatric institution.{{sfn|Veenhoven|Ewing|Samenlevingen|1975|p=28}}

By the end of the 1950s, confinement to a psychiatric institution had become the most commonly used method of punishing leaders of the political opposition.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} In the 1960s and 1970s, the trials of dissenters and their referral for "treatment" to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals under MVD control and oversight&lt;ref&gt;''A Chronicle of Current Events'' No 12, 28 February 1970 — 12.2 "The trial of P.G. Grigorenko", CCE No 13, 28 April 1970 — 13.8 "The trial of Ivan Yakhimovich and other trials", CCE No 15, 31 August 1970 — 15.1 "The trial of Natalya Gorbanevskaya".&lt;/ref&gt; came out into the open, and the world learned of a wave of "psychiatric terror" which was flatly denied by those in charge of the [[Serbsky Institute]].{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=41}} The bulk of psychiatric repression spans the period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=30}} As CPSU General Secretary, from November 1982 to February 1984, Yury Andropov demonstrated little patience with domestic dissafection and continued the Brezhnev Era policy of confining dissenters in mental hospitals.{{sfn|Schultz|2011|p=19}}

== Examination and hospitalization ==
Political dissidents were usually charged under Articles 70 (agitation and propaganda against the Soviet state) and 190-1 (dissemination of false fabrications defaming the Soviet state and social system) of the RSFSR Criminal Code.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} Forensic psychiatrists were asked to examine offenders whose mental state was considered abnormal by the investigating officers.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}

In almost every case, dissidents were examined at the Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=78}} in Moscow, where persons being prosecuted in court for committing political crimes were subjected to a forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=30}} Once certified, the accused and convicted were sent for [[involuntary treatment]] to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals controlled by the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]].{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=30}}

The accused had no right of appeal.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} The right was given to their relatives or other interested persons but they were not allowed to nominate psychiatrists to take part in the evaluation, because all psychiatrists were considered fully independent and equally credible before the law.{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}}

According to dissident poet [[Naum Korzhavin]], the atmosphere at the Serbsky Institute in [[Moscow]] altered almost overnight when [[Daniil Lunts]] took over as head of the Fourth Department (otherwise known as the Political Department).{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} Previously, psychiatric departments were regarded as a 'refuge' against being dispatched to the [[Gulag]]. Now that policy altered.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} The first reports of dissenters being hospitalized on non-medical grounds date from the early 1960s, not long after Georgy Morozov was appointed director of the Serbsky Institute.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} Both Morozov and Lunts were personally involved in numerous well-known cases and were notorious abusers of psychiatry for political purposes.{{sfn|Knapp|2007|p=402}} Most prisoners, in [[Viktor Nekipelov]]'s words, characterized Daniil Lunts as "no better than the criminal doctors who performed inhuman experiments on the prisoners in [[Nazi concentration camp]]s."{{sfn|Applebaum|2003|p=549}} Indeed, experimentation took place on patients, including sleep deprivation and exposure to electromagnetic radiation for the inducement of auditory hallucinations.

A well-documented practice was the use of psychiatric hospitals as temporary prisons during the two or three weeks around the 7 November ([[October Revolution]]) Day and [[May Day]] celebrations, to isolate "socially dangerous" persons who otherwise might protest in public or manifest other deviant behavior.{{sfn|Bloch|1978}}

== Struggle against abuse ==
{{main|Struggle against political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union}}
In the 1960s, a vigorous movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR.{{sfn|Fernando|2003|p=160}} Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union was denounced in the course of the Congresses of the [[World Psychiatric Association]] in [[Mexico City]] (1971), [[Hawaii]] (1977), [[Vienna]] (1983) and [[Athens]] (1989).{{sfn|Ougrin|Gluzman|Dratcu|2006}} The campaign to terminate political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was a key episode in the [[Cold War]], inflicting irretrievable damage on the prestige of medicine in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Healey|2011}}

== Classification of the victims ==
{{main|Cases of political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union}}

Upon analysis of over 200 well-authenticated cases covering the period 1962–1976, Sidney Bloch and Peter Reddaway developed a classification of the victims of Soviet psychiatric abuse. They were classified as:{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=30}}
# advocates of human rights or democratization;
# nationalists;
# would-be emigrants;
# religious believers;
# citizens inconvenient to the authorities.
The advocates of human rights and democratization, according to Bloch and Reddaway, made up about half the dissidents repressed by means of psychiatry.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=30}} Nationalists made up about one-tenth of the dissident population dealt with psychiatrically.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=31}} Would-be emigrants constituted about one-fifth of dissidents victimized by means of psychiatry.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=32}} People detained only because of their religious activity made up about fifteen per cent of dissident-patients.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=32}} Citizens inconvenient to the authorities because of their "obdurate" complaints about bureaucratic excesses and abuses accounted for about five per cent of dissidents subject to psychiatric abuse.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=33}}

In 1985, Peter Reddaway and Sidney Bloch provided documented data on some five hundred cases in their book ''Soviet Psychiatric Abuse''.{{sfn|Finlayson|1987}}

On basis of the available data and materials accumulated in the archives of the [[International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry]], one can confidently conclude that thousands of dissenters were hospitalized for political reasons.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} From 1994 to 1995, an investigative commission of Moscow psychiatrists explored the records of five prison psychiatric hospitals in Russia and discovered about two thousand cases of political abuse of psychiatry in these hospitals alone.{{sfn|Voren|2010a}} In 2004, [[Anatoly Prokopenko]] said he was surprised at the facts obtained by him from the official classified top secret documents by the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]], by the KGB, and MVD.{{sfn|Baburin|2004}} According to his calculations based on what he found in the documents, about 15,000 people were confined for political crimes in the psychiatric prison hospitals under the control of the MVD.{{sfn|Baburin|2004}} In 2005, referring to the Archives of the CPSU Central Committee and the records of the three Special Psychiatrial Hospitals&amp;nbsp;— Sychyovskaya, Leningrad and Chernyakhovsk hospitals&amp;nbsp;— to which human rights activists gained access in 1991, Prokopenko concluded that psychiatry had been used as punitive measure against about 20,000 people for purely political reasons.{{sfn|Agamirov|2005}} This was only a small part of the total picture, Prokopenko said. The data on the total number of people who had been held in all sixteen prison hospitals and in the 1,500 "open" psychiatric hospitals remains unknown because parts of the archives of the prison psychiatric hospitals and hospitals in general are classified and inaccessible.{{sfn|Agamirov|2005}} The figure of fifteen or twenty thousand political prisoners in psychiatric hospitals run by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs was first put forward by Prokopenko in the 1997 book ''Mad Psychiatry'' ("Безумная психиатрия"),{{sfn|Prokopenko|1997|p=154}} which was republished in 2005.{{sfn|Prokopenko|2005|p=187}}

An indication of the extent of the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR is provided by [[Semyon Gluzman]]'s calculation that the percentage of "the mentally ill" among those accused of so-called anti-Soviet activities proved many times higher than among criminal offenders.{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; The attention paid to political prisoners by Soviet psychiatrists was more than 40 times greater than their attention to ordinary criminal offenders.{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}} This derives from the following comparison: 1–2 % of all the forensic psychiatric examinations carried out by the Serbsky Institute targeted those accused of anti-Soviet activities;{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; convicted dissidents in penal institutions made up 0.05% of the total number of convicts;{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; 1–2 % is 40 times greater than 0.05%.{{sfn|Adler|Gluzman|1992}}&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt;

According to Viktor Luneyev, the struggle against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We do not know how many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights.{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=373}} No objective assessment of the total number of repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents.{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=378}} The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive.{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=378}} They are scattered between the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]], the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee ([[Goskomstat]]), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs ([[MVD (Russia)|MVD of Russia]]), the [[FSB (Russia)|FSB of Russia]], the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former [[Soviet Republics]], now the 11 independent countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] or the three Baltic States ([[Baltics]]).{{sfn|Luneyev|2005|p=378}}

=== Concealment of the data ===

According to Russian psychiatrist [[Emmanuil Gushansky]], the scale of psychiatric abuses in the past, the use of psychiatric doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed.&lt;ref name=Gushansky&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Gushansky|year1=1999|year2=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs ([[MVD]]) and Health ([[USSR Health Ministry]]), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; [[Dan Healey]] shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: the contents of the main archives are still classified and inaccessible.{{sfn|Healey|2014}} Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement{{sfn|Gluzman|2013a}} where Gluzman saw them in 1989.{{sfn|Gluzman|2009a}} All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any biographical data they contain{{sfn|Gluzman|2013a}} is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.{{sfn|Gluzman|2009a}}

{{quote|The scale of the application of methods of repressive psychiatry in the USSR is testified by inexorable figures and facts. A commission of the top Party leadership headed by [[Alexei Kosygin]] reached a decision in 1978 to build 80 psychiatric hospitals and 8 special psychiatric institutions in addition to those already in existence. Their construction was to be completed by 1990. They were to be built in [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Khabarovsk]], [[Kemerovo]], [[Samara, Russia|Kuibyshev]], [[Novosibirsk]], and other parts of the Soviet Union. In the course of the changes that the country underwent in 1988, five prison hospitals were transferred from the MVD to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, while another five were closed down. There was a hurried covering of tracks through the mass rehabilitation of patients, some of whom were mentally disabled (in one and the same year no less than 800,000 patients were removed from the psychiatric registry). In Leningrad alone 60,000 people with a diagnosis of mental illness were released and rehabilitated in 1991 and 1992. In 1978, 4.5 million people throughout the USSR were registered as psychiatric patients. This was equivalent to the population of many civilized countries.{{sfn|Sobchak|2005|pp=6–7}}}}

In Ukraine, a study of the origins of the political abuse of psychiatry was conducted for five years on the basis of the State archives.{{sfn|Voren|2009b}} A total of 60 people were again examined.{{sfn|Voren|2009b}} All were citizens of Ukraine, convicted of political crimes and hospitalized on the territory of Ukraine.

In its 2000 report, the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression included only the following four phrases about the political abuse of psychiatry:{{sfn|Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims|2000}}
{{quote|The Commission has also considered such a complex, socially relevant issue, as the use of psychiatry for political purposes.

According to the incomplete data, hundreds of thousands of people have been illegally placed to psychiatric institutions of the country over the years of Soviet power. The rehabilitation of these people was limited, at best, to their removal from the registry of psychiatric patients and usually remains so today, due to gaps in the legislation.}}

== Theoretical analysis ==
In 1990, ''Psychiatric Bulletin of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]]'' published the article "Compulsion in psychiatry: blessing or curse?" by Russian psychiatrist [[Anatoly Koryagin]]. It contains analysis of the abuse of psychiatry and eight arguments by which the existence of a system of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR can easily be demonstrated. As Koryagin wrote, in a dictatorial State with a totalitarian regime, such as the USSR, the laws have at all times served not the purpose of self-regulation of the life of society but have been one of the major levers by which to manipulate the behavior of subjects. Every Soviet citizen has constantly been straight considered state property and been regarded not as the aim, but as a means to achieve the rulers' objectives. From the perspective of state pragmatism, a mentally sick person was regarded as a burden to society, using up the state's material means without recompense and not producing anything, and even potentially capable of inflicting harm. Therefore, the Soviet State never considered it reasonable to pass special legislative acts protecting the material and legal part of the patients' life. It was only instructions of the legal and medical departments that stipulated certain rules of handling the mentally sick and imposing different sanctions on them. A person with a mental disorder was automatically divested of all rights and depended entirely on the psychiatrists' will. Practically anybody could undergo psychiatric examination on the most senseless grounds and the issued diagnosis turned him into a person without rights. It was this lack of legal rights and guarantees that advantaged a system of repressive psychiatry in the country.{{sfn|Koryagin|1990}}

According to American psychiatrist Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did not have any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the [[USSR Ministry of Health]]. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered not. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.{{sfn|Lapshin|2003}}

According to Yuri Savenko, the president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia (the IPA), punitive psychiatry arises on the basis of the interference of three main factors:&lt;ref name=Savenko&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Savenko|year1=2005a|year2=2009b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ideologizing of science, its breakaway from the achievements of world psychiatry, the party orientation of Soviet forensic psychiatry.
# The lack of legal basis.
# The total nationalization of mental health service.
Their interaction system is principally sociological: the presence of the Penal Code article on slandering the state system inevitably results in sending a certain percentage of citizens to forensic psychiatric examination.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a}} Thus, it is not psychiatry itself that is punitive, but the totalitarian state uses psychiatry for punitive purposes with ease.{{sfn|Savenko|2005a}}

According to [[Larry Gostin]], the root cause of the problem was the State itself.{{sfn|Gostin|1986}} The definition of danger was radically extended by the Soviet criminal system to cover "political" as well as customary physical types of "danger".{{sfn|Gostin|1986}} As Bloch and Reddaway note, there are no objective reliable criteria to determine whether the person's behavior will be dangerous, and approaches to the definition of dangerousness greatly differ among psychiatrists.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1977|p=29}}

[[Richard Bonnie]], a professor of law and medicine at the [[University of Virginia School of Law]], mentioned the deformed nature of the Soviet psychiatric profession as one of the explanations for why it was so easily bent toward the repressive objectives of the state, and pointed out the importance of a civil society and, in particular, independent professional organizations separate and apart from the state as one of the most substantial lessons from the period.{{sfn|Moran|2010}}

According to [[Norman Sartorius]], a former president of the [[World Psychiatric Association]], political abuse of psychiatry in the former Soviet Union was facilitated by the fact that the national classification included categories that could be employed to label dissenters, who could then be forcibly incarcerated and kept in psychiatric hospitals for "treatment".{{sfn|Sartorius|2010}} Darrel Regier, vice-chair of the [[DSM-5]] task force, has a similar opinion that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was sustained by the existence of a classification developed in the Soviet Union and used to organize psychiatric treatment and care.{{sfn|Regier|2011|p=75}} In this classification, there were categories with diagnoses that could be given to political dissenters and led to the harmful involuntary medication.{{sfn|Regier|2011|p=75}}

According to Moscow psychiatrist [[Alexander Danilin]], the so-called "nosological" approach in the Moscow psychiatric school established by Snezhnevsky boiles down to the ability to make the only diagnosis, schizophrenia; psychiatry is not science but such a system of opinions and people by the thousands are falling victims to these opinions—millions of lives were crippled by virtue of the concept "sluggish schizophrenia" introduced some time once by an academician Snezhnevsky, whom Danilin called a state criminal.{{sfn|Danilin|2008}}

[[St Petersburg]] academic psychiatrist professor [[Yuri Nuller]] notes that the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=17}} Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} Snezhnevsky's concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} It resulted in the broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}} However, Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.{{sfn|Nuller|2008|p=18}}

According to American psychiatrist Walter Reich, the misdiagnoses of dissidents resulted from some characteristics of Soviet psychiatry that were distortions of standard psychiatric logic, theory, and practice.{{sfn|Reich|1983}}

According to [[Semyon Gluzman]], abuse of psychiatry to suppress dissent is based on condition of psychiatry in a totalitarian state.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Psychiatric paradigm of a totalitarian state is culpable for its expansion into spheres which are not initially those of psychiatric competence.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Psychiatry as a social institution, formed and functioning in the totalitarian state, is incapable of not being totalitarian.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Such psychiatry is forced to serve the two differently directed principles: care and treatment of mentally ill citizens, on the one hand, and psychiatric repression of people showing political or ideological dissent, on the other hand.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; In the conditions of the totalitarian state, independent-minded psychiatrists appeared and may again appear, but these few people cannot change the situation in which thousands of others, who were brought up on incorrect pseudoscientific concepts and fear of the state, will sincerely believe that the uninhibited, free thinking of a citizen is a symptom of madness.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt; Gluzman specifies the following six premises for the unintentional participation of doctors in abuses:&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt;
# The specificity, in the totalitarian state, of the psychiatric paradigm tightly sealed from foreign influences.
# The lack of legal conscience in most citizens including doctors.
# Disregard for fundamental human rights on the part of the lawmaker and law enforcement agencies.
# Declaratory nature or the absence of legislative acts that regulate providing psychiatric care in the country. The USSR, for example, adopted such an act only in 1988.
# The absolute state paternalism of totalitarian regimes, which naturally gives rise to the dominance of the archaic paternalistic ethical concept in medical practice. Professional consciousness of the doctor is based on the almost absolute right to make decisions without the patient's consent (i.e. there is disregard for the principle of informed consent to treatment or withdrawal from it).
# The fact, in psychiatric hospitals, of frustratingly bad conditions, which refer primarily to the poverty of health care and inevitably lead to the dehumanization of the personnel including doctors.
Gluzman says that there, of course, may be a different approach to the issue expressed by [[Michel Foucault]].{{sfn|Gluzman|2012|p=xxvii}}
According to [[Michael L. Perlin|Michael Perlin]], Foucault in his book ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' documented the history of using institutional psychiatry as a political tool, researched the expanded use of the public hospitals in the 17th century in France and came to the conclusion that "confinement [was an] answer to an economic crisis... reduction of wages, unemployment, scarcity of coin" and, by the 18th century, the psychiatric hospitals satisfied "the indissociably economic and moral demand for confinement."{{sfn|Perlin|2006}}

In 1977, British psychiatrist [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]] asked Foucault the same question which [[Claude Bourdet]] had formerly asked [[Viktor Fainberg]] during a press conference given by Fainberg and [[Leonid Plyushch]]: when the USSR has the whole penitentiary and police apparatus, which could take charge of anybody, and which is perfect in itself, why do they use psychiatry? Foucault answered it was not a question of a ''distortion'' of the use of psychiatry but that was its fundamental project.{{sfn|Foucault|Kritzman|1990|p=182}} In the discussion ''Confinement, Psychiatry, Prison'', Foucault states the cooperation of psychiatrists with the KGB in the Soviet Union was not abuse of medicine, but an evident case and "condensation" of psychiatry's "inheritance", an "intensification, the ossification of a kinship structure that has never ceased to function."{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=129}} Foucault believed that the abuse of psychiatry in the USSR of the 1960s was a logical extension of the invasion of psychiatry into the legal system.{{sfn|Fernando|Ndegwa|Wilson|1998|p=37}} In the discussion with [[Jean Laplanche]] and [[Robert Badinter]], Foucault says that criminologists of the 1880—1900s started speaking surprisingly modern language: "The crime cannot be, for the criminal, but an abnormal, disturbed behavior. If he upsets society, it's because he himself is upset".&lt;ref name=Foucault1&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Foucault, Laplanche &amp; Badinter|year1=1977|year2=1989|loc2=p. 168|year3=2006|loc3=pp. 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the twofold conclusions.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; First, "the judicial apparatus is no longer useful." The judges, as men of law, understand such complex, alien legal issues, purely psychological matters no better than the criminal. So commissions of psychiatrists and physicians should be substituted for the judicial apparatus.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; And in this vein, concrete projects were proposed.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; Second, "We must certainly treat this individual who is dangerous only because he is sick. But, at the same time, we must protect society against him."&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; Hence comes the idea of mental isolation with a mixed function: therapeutic and prophylactic.&lt;ref name=Foucault1/&gt; In the 1900s, these projects have given rise to very lively responses from European judicial and political bodies.&lt;ref name=Foucault2&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Foucault, Laplanche &amp; Badinter|year1=1977|year2=1989|loc2=p. 169|year3=2006|loc3=pp. 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they found a wide field of applications when the Soviet Union became one of the most common but by no means exceptional cases.&lt;ref name=Foucault2/&gt;

According to American psychiatrist Jonas Robitscher, psychiatry has been playing a part in controlling deviant behavior for three hundred years.{{sfn|Robitscher|1980|pp=326–327}} Vagrants, "originals," eccentrics, and homeless wanderers who did little harm but were vexatious to the society they lived in were, and sometimes still are, confined to psychiatric hospitals or deprived of their legal rights.{{sfn|Robitscher|1980|pp=326–327}} Some critics of psychiatry consider the practice as a political use of psychiatry and regard psychiatry as promoting timeserving.{{sfn|Robitscher|1980|pp=326–327}}

As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, it is difficult for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment to Soviet society.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=40}} This view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=40}}

An example of the low threshold is a point of [[Donetsk]] psychiatrist Valentine Pekhterev, who argues that psychiatrists speak of the necessity of adapting oneself to society, estimate the level of man's social functioning, his ability to adequately test the reality and so forth.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} In Pekhterev's words, these speeches hit point-blank on the dissidents and revolutionaries, because all of them are poorly functioning in society, are hardly adapting to it either initially or after increasing requirements.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} They turn their inability to adapt themselves to society into the view that the company breaks step and only they know how to help the company restructure itself.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The dissidents regard the cases of personal maladjustment as a proof of public ill-being.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The more such cases, the easier it is to present their personal ill-being as public one.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} They bite the society's hand that feed them only because they are not given a right place in society.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} Unlike the dissidents, the psychiatrists destroy the hardly formed defense attitude in the dissidents by regarding "public well-being" as personal one.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The psychiatrists extract teeth from the dissidents, stating that they should not bite the feeding hand of society only because the tiny group of the dissidents feel bad being at their place.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} The psychiatrists claim the need to treat not society but the dissidents and seek to improve society by preserving and improving the mental health of its members.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}} After reading the book ''Institute of Fools'' by [[Viktor Nekipelov]], Pekhterev concluded that allegations against the psychiatrists sounded from the lips of a negligible but vociferous part of inmates who when surfeiting themselves with cakes pretended to be sufferers.{{sfn|Pekhterev|2013}}

According to the response by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev in his article condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was not so bad place and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were in a certain sense "on holiday" in comparison with the living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the "gates of hell" from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in [[Chernyakhovsk]], [[Dnepropetrovsk]], [[Kazan]], [[Blagoveshchensk]], and that is not all.{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment.{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} Many went crazy, could not endure what was happening to them, some even died during the "treatment" (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin).{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us.{{sfn|Voren|2013c}} The Soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting the mentally ill as the most vulnerable group of society had nothing on the [[action T4|Nazi euthanasia programs]].&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"&gt;{{harvnb|Trehub|2013}}; {{harvnb|Zakal|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in Mordovian concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically.&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"/&gt; The recent history of the USSR should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of the Soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"/&gt; The issue remains highly relevant.&lt;ref name="Trehub, Zakal"/&gt;

According to Fedor Kondratev, an expert of the Serbsky Center and supporter of Snezhnevsky and his colleagues who developed the concept of sluggish schizophrenia in the 1960s,{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=46}} those arrested by the KGB under RSFSR Criminal Code Article 70 ("anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda"), 190-1 ("dissemination of knowingly false fabrications that defame the Soviet state and social system") made up, in those years, the main group targeted by the period of using psychiatry for political purposes.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=178}} It was they who began to be searched for "psychopathological mechanisms" and, therefore, mental illness which gave the grounds to recognize an accused person as mentally incompetent, to debar him from appearance and defence in court, and then to send him for compulsory treatment to a special psychiatric hospital of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]].{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=178}} The trouble (not guilt) of Soviet psychiatric science was its theoretical overideologization as a result of the strict demand to severely preclude any deviations from the "exclusively scientific" concept of [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} This showed, in particular, in the fact that Soviet psychiatry under the totalitarian regime considered that penetrating the inner life of an ill person was flawed psychologization, existentionalization.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} In this connection, one did not admit the possibility that an individual can behave "in a different way than others do" not only because of his mental illness but on the ground alone of his moral sets consistently with his conscience.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} It entailed the consequence: if a person different from all others opposes the political system, one needs to search for "psychopathological mechanisms" of his dissent.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} Even in cases when catamnesis confirmed the correctness of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it did not always mean that mental disorders were the cause of dissent and, all the more, that one needed to administer compulsory treatment "for it" in special psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} What seems essential is another fact that the mentally ill could oppose the totalitarianism as well, by no means due to their "psychopathological mechanisms", but as persons who, despite having the diagnosis of schizophrenia, retained moral civic landmarks.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=180}} Any ill person with schizophrenia could be a dissident if his conscience could not keep silent, Kondratev says.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=182}}

According to St Petersburg psychiatrist Vladimir Pshizov, with regard to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not to take into account an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis.{{sfn|Valovich|2003}} Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant.{{sfn|Valovich|2003}} While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric [[nomenklatura]] retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.{{sfn|Valovich|2003}}

As Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko notes, the use of punitive psychiatry allowed of avoiding the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=77}} Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can be based on a preconception.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}} Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}} The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}} At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=47}}

German psychiattist Hanfried Helmchen says the uncertainty of diagnosis is prone to other than medical influence, e.g., political influence, as was the case with Soviet dissenters who were stifled by a psychiatric diagnosis, especially that of "sluggish schizophrenia," in order to take them away from society in special psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|Helmchen|2013}}

According to Russian psychologist Dmitry Leontev, punitive psychiatry in the Soviet Union was based on the assumption that only a madman can go against public dogma and seek for truth and justice.{{sfn|Leontev|2010}}

K. Fulford, A. Smirnov, and E. Snow state: "An important vulnerability factor, therefore, for the abuse of psychiatry, is the subjective nature of the observations on which psychiatric diagnosis currently depends."{{sfn|Fulford|Smirnov|Snow|1993}} The concerns about political abuse of psychiatry as a tactic of controlling dissent have been regularly voiced by American psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adshead|2003}}; {{harvs|txt|author=Szasz|year1=1965|year2=1971|year3=1977|year4=1978a|year5=1978b|year6=1987|year7=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he mentioned that these authors, who correctly emphasized the value-laden nature of psychiatric diagnoses and the subjective character of psychiatric classifications, failed to accept the role of psychiatric power.{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} Musicologists, drama critics, art historians, and many other scholars also create their own subjective classifications; however, lacking state-legitimated power over persons, their classifications do not lead to anyone's being deprived of property, liberty, or life.{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} For instance, plastic surgeon's classification of beauty is subjective, but the plastic surgeon cannot treat his or her patient without the patient's consent, therefore, there ''cannot'' be any political abuse of plastic surgery.{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} The bedrock of political medicine is coercion masquerading as medical treatment.{{sfn|Szasz|2001|p=497}} What transforms coercion into therapy are physicians ''diagnosing'' the person's condition a "illness," ''declaring'' the intervention they impose on the victim a "treatment," and legislators and judges ''legitimating'' these categorizations as "illnesses" and "treatments."{{sfn|Szasz|2001|p=497}} In the same way, physician-[[eugenicists]] advocated killing certain disabled or ill persons as a form of treatment for both society and patient long before the Nazis came to power.{{sfn|Szasz|2001|p=497}} Szasz argued that the spectacle of the Western psychiatrists loudly condemning Soviet colleagues for their abuse of professional standards was largely an exercise in hypocrisy.&lt;ref name="Szasz 1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Gosden|2001|p=220}}; {{harvnb|Szasz|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatric abuse, such as people usually associated with practices in the former USSR, was connected not with the misuse of psychiatric diagnoses, but with the political power built into the social role of the psychiatrist in democratic and totalitarian societies alike.&lt;ref name="Szasz 1994"/&gt; Psychiatrically and legally fit subjects for involuntary mental hospitalization had always been "dissidents."{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} It is the contents and contours of dissent that has changed.{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} Before the [[American Civil War]], dissent was constituted by being a Negro and wanting to escape from slavery.{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} In Soviet Russia, dissent was constituted by wanting to "reform" [[Marxism]] or emigrate to escape from it.{{sfn|Szasz|1978a}} As Szasz put it, "the classification by slave owners and slave traders of certain individuals as Negroes was scientific, in the sense that whites were rarely classified as blacks. But that did not prevent the "abuse" of such racial classification, because (what we call) its abuse was, in fact, its use."{{sfn|Szasz|1994}} The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the "[[Therapeutic State]]", a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed ("cured") through pseudomedical interventions.{{sfn|Costigan|2004|p=17}} Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, overeating, smoking, and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured.{{sfn|Costigan|2004|p=17}}

As Michael Robertson and Garry Walter suppose, psychiatric power in practically all societies expands on the grounds of public safety, which, in the view of the leaders of the USSR, was best maintained by the repression of dissidence.{{sfn|Robertson|Walter|2013|p=86}} According to [[Gwen Adshead]], a British forensic psychotherapist at the [[Broadmoor Hospital]], the question is what is meant by the word "abnormal."{{sfn|Adshead|2003}} Evidently it is possible for abnormal to be identified as "socially inappropriate."{{sfn|Adshead|2003}} If that is the case, social and political dissent is turned into a symptom by the medical terminology, and thereby becomes an individual's personal problem, not a social matter.{{sfn|Adshead|2003}}

According to Russian psychiatrist Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is the only medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence for the benefit of the patient.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010b}} It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; In Russia, all that goes by opposites.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt;

[[Vladimir Bukovsky]], well known for his [[struggle against political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union]], explained that using psychiatry against dissidents was usable to the KGB because hospitalization did not have an end date, and, as a result, there were cases when dissidents were kept in psychiatric prison hospitals for 10 or even 15 years.{{sfn|Davidoff|2013}} "Once they pump you with drugs, they can forget about you", he said and added, "I saw people who basically were asleep for years."{{sfn|Rodriguez|2007}}

US President [[Ronald Reagan]] attributed the view that the "brutal treatment of Soviet dissidents was due to bureaucratic inertia."{{sfn|Altshuler|2005|p=61}}

== Residual problems ==
In the opinion of the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]] chairwoman [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]], the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s.{{sfn|NPZ|2004}} The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries.{{sfn|Lyons|O'Malley|2002}} When psychiatric profession is discredited in one part of the world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world.{{sfn|Voren|Bloch|1989|p=13}} Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Bloch|1997}} There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense.{{sfn|Lyons|O'Malley|2002}} Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.{{sfn|NPZ|2004}}

As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today subjective position of a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence is related to the primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors.{{sfn|Gushansky|2000}} Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt;

The psychiatrist became a scarecrow attaching psychiatric labels.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; He is feared, is not confided, is not taken into confidence in the secrets of one's soul and is asked to provide only medications.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Psychiatric labels, or [[social stigma|stigmas]], have spread so widely that there is no such thing as the media that does not call a disliked person ''[[schizo]]'' and does not generalize [[psychiatric assessment]]s to phenomena of public life.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; The word ''[[psikhushka]]'' entered everyday vocabulary.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; All persons who deviate from the usual standards of thought and behavior are declared mentally ill, with an approving giggling of public.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; Not surprisingly, during such a stigmatization, people with real mental disorders fear publicity like the plague.&lt;ref name=Gushansky/&gt; [[Vilnius]] psychologist Oleg Lapin has the same point that politicians and the press attach psychological, psychiatric and medical labels; he adds that psychiatry has acquired the new status of normalizing life that was previously possessed by religion.{{sfn|Peters|2014}} Formerly, one could say: you are going against God or God is with us; now one can say: I behave reasonably, adequately, and you do not behave in that way.{{sfn|Peters|2014}} In 2007, [[Alexander Dugin]], a professor at the [[Moscow State University]] and adviser to [[Chairman of the State Duma|State Duma speaker]] [[Sergei Naryshkin]], presented opponents of [[Vladimir Putin]]'s policy as mentally ill by saying, "There are no longer opponents of Putin's policy, and if there are, they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sokolov|2007}}; {{harvnb|Pasko|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Moscow Regional Psychiatric Newspaper'' of 2012, psychiatrist Dilya Enikeyeva in violation of [[medical privacy]] and ethics publicized the diagnosis of [[histrionic personality disorder]], which she in absentia gave [[Kseniya Sobchak]], a Russian TV anchor and a member of political opposition, and stated that Sobchak was harmful to society.{{sfn|Savenko|2012}}

Robert van Voren noted that after the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], it became apparent that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was only the tip of the iceberg, the sign that much more was basically wrong.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} This much more realistic image of Soviet psychiatry showed up only after the Soviet regime began to loosen its grip on society and later lost control over the developments and in the end entirely disintegrated.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} It demonstrated that the actual situation was much sorer and that many individuals had been affected.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} Millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital-based mental health service.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} Living conditions in clinics were bad, sometimes even terrible, and violations of human rights were rampant.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=476}} According to the data of a census published in 1992, the mortality of the ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of the general population by 4–6 times for the age of 20–39 years, by 3–4 times for the age of 30–39 years, by 1.5–2 times for the age over 40 years (larger values are for women).{{sfn|Ivanova|1992}}

According to Robert van Voren, although for several years, especially after the implosion of the USSR and during the first years of [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s rule, the positions of the Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}} They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure of psychiatric services in Russia.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}} On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}} Even the reform efforts made in such places as [[St. Petersburg]], [[Tomsk]], and [[Kaliningrad]] have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.{{sfn|Voren|2010b|p=477}}

Throughout the post-communist period, the pharmaceutical industry has mainly been an obstacle to reform.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=24}} Aiming to explore the vast market of the former USSR, they used the situation to make professionals and services totally dependent on their financial sustenance, turned the major attention to the availability of medicines rather than that of psycho-social rehabilitation services, and stimulated corruption within the mental health sector very much.{{sfn|Voren|2013a|p=24}}

At the turn of the century, the [[psychiatric reform in Italy|psychiatric reform]] that had been implemented by [[Franco Basaglia]] in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} But when it became clear that even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010c}} Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence.{{sfn|Gushansky|2010c}} Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole.{{sfn|Clark|2014}} As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community.{{sfn|Clark|2014}} Despite the 1992 [[Russian Mental Health Law]], coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period.{{sfn|Bonnie|2002}} In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.{{sfn|Mundt|Frančišković|Gurovich|2012}}

In 2005, the Russian Federation had one of the highest levels of psychiatric beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013.{{sfn|Reiter|2013}} The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007.{{sfn|Jenkins|Lancashire|McDaid|2007}} In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation]].{{sfn|Reiter|2013}} It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals.{{sfn|NPZ|2008}} Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions.{{sfn|Vinogradova|2014|p=170}} Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need to increase the number of places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.{{sfn|Vinogradova|2014|p=170}}
[[File:Kiev - hospital2.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|One of the buildings of the Pavlov Psychiatric Hospital in [[Kiev]]]]
At his press conference in 2008, [[Semyon Gluzman]] said that the surplus in [[Ukraine]] of hospitals for inpatient treatment of the mentally ill was a relic of the totalitarian communist regime and that Ukraine did not have epidemic of schizophrenia but somehow Ukraine had about 90 large psychiatric hospitals including the Pavlov Hospital where beds in its children's unit alone were more than in the whole of [[Great Britain]].{{sfn|Gluzman press conference|2008}} In Ukraine, public opinion did not contribute to the protection of citizens against possible recurrence of political abuse of psychiatry.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} There were no demonstrations and rallies in support of the mental health law.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} But there was a public campaign against developing the civilized law and against liberalizing the provision of psychiatric care in the country.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} The campaign was initiated and conducted by relatives of psychiatric patients.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} They wrote to newspapers, yelled in busy places and around them, behaved in the unbridled way in ministerial offices and corridors.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} Once Gluzman saw through a trolleybus window a group of 20-30 people standing by a window of the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]] with red flags, portraits of [[Lenin]] and [[Stalin]] and the slogan coarsely written on the white cardboard: "Get the Gluzman psychiatry off Ukraine!"{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} Activists of the dissident movement far from the nostalgia for the past also participated in the actions against changes in the mental health system.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} But in general, it should be remembered that all these protest actions have been activated by nomenklatura psychiatrists.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013b}} The whole Ukrainian psychiatric system actually consists of the two units: hospital for treatment of acute psychiatric conditions and internat-hospice for helpless "chronic patients" unable to live on their own.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} And between hospital and internat-hospice is desert.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} That is why about 40 percent of patients in any Ukrainian psychiatric hospital are so-called social patients whose stay in the psychiatric hospital is not due to medical indications.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} A similar pattern is in internats.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} A significant part of their lifelong customers could have lived long enough in society despite their mental illnesses.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} They could have lived quite comfortably and safely for themselves and others in special dorms, nursing homes, "halfway houses".{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}} Ukraine does not have anything like that.{{sfn|Gluzman|2013d}}

In the Soviet times, mental hospitals were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Sofia Dorinskaya, a human rights activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who have been living in a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home.{{sfn|Dorinskaya|2014|p=37}} [[Deinstitutionalization]] has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of [[xenophobia]].{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}}

Traditional values have endured the attempt by western institutions to impose a positive image of deviant behavior.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} For instance, in spite of the removal of [[homosexuality]] from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the [[Rostov Region]] view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The psychiatrists sustain the ban on [[Pride parade|gay parade]]s and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}} The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to [[Dozhd]] says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the [[World Health Organization]] removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true.{{sfn|Kekelidze|2013a}} Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to [[antipsychiatry|antipsychiatric actions]], and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one.{{sfn|Savenko|Vinogradova|2005}} In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.{{sfn|Savenko|Perekhov|2014}}

In 1994, there was organized a conference concerned with the theme of political abuse of psychiatry and attended by representatives from different former [[Soviet Republics]]&amp;nbsp;— from Russia, [[Belarus]], [[the Baltics]], [[the Caucasus]], and some of the [[Central Asian Republics]].{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} [[Dainius Puras]] made a report on the situation within the [[Lithuanian Psychiatric Association]], where discussion had been held but no resolution had been passed.{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} [[Yuri Nuller]] talked over how in Russia the wind direction was gradually changing and the systematic political abuse of psychiatry was again being denied and degraded as an issue of "hyperdiagnosis" or "scientific disagreement."{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} It was particularly noteworthy that [[Tatyana Dmitrieva]], the then Director of the [[Serbsky Institute]], was a proponent of such belittlement.{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}} This was not so queer, because she was a close friend of the key architects of "political psychiatry."{{sfn|Voren|2009a|p=188}}

In the early 1990s, she spoke the required words of repentance for political abuse of psychiatry{{sfn|Svetova|2007}} which had had unprecedented dimensions in the Soviet Union for discrediting, intimidation and suppression of the human rights movement carried out primarily in this institution.{{sfn|Savenko|2004b}} Her words were widely broadcast abroad but were published only in the St. Petersburg newspaper ''[[Chas Pik]]'' within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Savenko|2004b}}; {{harvnb|Svetova|2007|}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in her 2001 book ''Aliyans Prava i Milosediya'' (''The Alliance of Law and Mercy''), Dmitrieva wrote that there were no psychiatric abuses and certainly no more than in Western countries.{{sfn|Savenko|2004b}} Moreover, the book makes the charge that professor [[Vladimir Serbsky]] and other intellectuals were wrong not to cooperate with the [[police department]] in preventing [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution]] and bloodsheds and that the current generation is wrong to oppose the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorelik|2003}}; {{harvnb|Savenko|2004b}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Dmitrieva asserted that the practice of "punitive psychiatry" had been grossly exaggerated, while nothing wrong had been done by the Serbsky Institute.{{sfn|Blomfield|2007b}} After that an official at the Serbsky Institute declared "patient" [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], who was then going to run for the President of the Russian Federation, undoubtedly "psychopathic".{{sfn|Blomfield|2007b}}

While speaking of the Serbsky Center, Yuri Savenko alleges that "practically nothing has changed. They have no shame at the institute about their role with the Communists. They are the same people, and they do not want to apologize for all their actions in the past." Attorney [[Karen Nersisyan]] agrees: "Serbsky is not an organ of medicine. It's an organ of power."{{sfn|Glasser|2002}} According to human rights activist and former psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the system of Soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed, the Serbsky Institute is standing where it did, the same people who worked in the Soviet system are working there.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}} She says we have a situation like after the defeat of [[fascism]] in Germany, when fascism officially collapsed, but all governors of acres, judges and all people remained after the fascist regime.{{sfn|Agamirov|2007}}

In his article of 2002, [[Alan A. Stone]], who as a member of team had examined [[Pyotr Grigorenko]] and found him mentally healthy in 1979,{{sfn|US GPO|1984|p=74}} disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of psychiatry as a tool against pacific dissidence in the former USSR.{{sfn|Munro|2002b}} He asserted that it was time for psychiatry in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR in the hope of discovering that Soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation.{{sfn|Stone|2002}} In Stone's words, he believes that [[Snezhnevsky]] was wrongly condemned by critics.{{sfn|Stone|2002}} According to Stone, one of the first points the Soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of psychiatry make is that the revolution is the greatest good for the greatest number, the greatest piece of social justice, and the greatest beneficence imaginable in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{harvs|txt|author=Stone|year1=1984|year2=1985|loc2=p. 72|year3=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western view, the ethical compass of the Soviet psychiatrists begins to wander when they act in the service of this greatest beneficence.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

According to St Petersburg psychiatrist Vladimir Pshizov, a disastrous factor for domestic psychiatry is that those who had committed the [[crime against humanity]] were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public has been reduced to making a business of [[psychopharmacologic]] drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the [[CPSU]] [[nomenklatura]], which they remained so far.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg.&lt;ref&gt;abbreviation expansion: organizer of a party group&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his [[dissertation]].{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}} Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.{{sfn|Pshizov|2006}}

Robert van Voren also says Russian psychiatry is now being headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry that was in the late 1980s.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Russian psychiatrists do not have access to specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid.{{sfn|Polyakovskaya|Gorelik|2013}} The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the [[Global Initiative on Psychiatry]] has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years.{{sfn|Voren|2012}} Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.{{sfn|Voren|2012}}

Many of the current leaders of Russian psychiatry, especially those who were related to the establishment in Soviet period, have resiled from their avowal read at the 1989 General Assembly of the WPA that Soviet psychiatry had been systematically abused for political purposes.{{sfn|Dudley|Silove|Gale|2012|p=237}} Among such leaders who did so is [[Aleksandr Tiganov]], a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, the director of its Mental Health Research Center, and the chief psychiatrist of the [[Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation]]. In 2011, when asked whether ill or healthy were those examined because of their disagreements with authority, Tiganov answered, "These people suffered from sluggish schizophrenia and were on the psychiatric registry."{{sfn|Vyzhutovich|2011}} According to Tiganov, it was rumored that Snezhnevsky took pity on dissenters and gave them a diagnosis required for placing in a special hospital to save them from a prison, but it is not true, he honestly did his medical duty.{{sfn|Vyzhutovich|2011}} The same ideas are voiced in the 2014 interview by Anatoly Smulevich, a pupil of Snezhnevsky, full member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; he says what was attributed to Snesnevsky was that he recognized the healthy as the ill, it did not happen and is pure slander, it is completely ruled out for him to give a diagnosis to a healthy person.{{sfn|Smulevich|Morozov|2014}}

In 2007, Mikhail Vinogradov, one of the leading staff members of the Serbsky Center, strongly degraded the human rights movement of the Soviet era in every possible way and tried to convince that all political dissidents who had been to his institution were indeed mentally ill.{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} In his opinion, "now it is clear that all of them are deeply affected people."{{sfn|Savenko|2007a}} In 2012, Vinogradov said the same, "Do you talk about human rights activists? Most of them are just unhealthy people, I talked with them. As for the dissident General Grigorenko, I too saw him, kept him under observation, and noted oddities of his thinking. But he was eventually allowed to go abroad, as you know... Who? Bukovsky? I talked with him, and he is a completely crazy character. But he too was allowed to go abroad! You see, human rights activists are people who, due to their mental pathology, are unable to restrain themselves within the standards of society, and the West encourages their inability to do so."{{sfn|Mishina|2012}} In the same year, he offered to restore Soviet mental health law and said it "has never been used for political persecution." Human rights activists who claim it did, in Vinogradov's words, "are not very mentally healthy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|RSN|2012}}; {{harvnb|NG|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian psychiatrist Fedor Kondratev not only denied accusations that he was ever personally engaged in Soviet abuses of psychiatry; he stated publicly that the very conception of the existence of Soviet-era "punitive psychiatry" was nothing more than: "the fantasy [vymysel] of the very same people who are now defending totalitarian sects. This is slander, which was [previously] used for anti-Soviet ends, but is now being used for anti-Russian ends."{{sfn|Fedor|2011|p=177}} He says that there were attempts to use of psychiatry for political purposes but there was no mass psychiatric terror, he calls allegations about the terror a propagandistic weapon of activists of the Cold War.{{sfn|Kondratev|2010|p=181}} As [[Alexander Podrabinek]] writes, psychiatrists of punitive conscription and namely Kondratev are relatively indifferent to the public's indignation over illegal use of psychiatry both in Soviet times and now, they do not notice this public, allowing themselves to ignore any unprofessional opinion.{{sfn|Podrabinek|2014}} In response to the article by Podrabinek, Kondratev instituted a suit against Podrabinek under [[Russian Civil Code]] Article 152 on protecting one's honor, dignity and business reputation.{{sfn|Kondratev|2014}} According to Valery Krasnov and Isaak Gurovich, official representatives of psychiatry involved in its political abuse never acknowledged the groundlessness of their diagnostics and actions.{{sfn|Krasnov|Gurovich|2012}} The absence of the acknowledgement and the absence of an analysis of made errors cast a shadow upon all psychiatrists in the USSR and, especially, in Russia.{{sfn|Krasnov|Gurovich|2012}} As Russian-American historian Georgi Chernyavsky writes, after the fall of the communist regime, no matter how some psychiatrists lean over backwards, foaming at the mouth to this day when stating that they were slandered, that they did not give dissidents diagnoses-sentences, or that, at least, these cases were isolated and not at all related to their personal activities, no matter how the doctors, if one may call them so, try to rebut hundreds if not thousands of real facts, it is undoable.{{sfn|Chernyavsky|2005|p=9–10}}

In 2004, Savenko stated that the passed law on the state expert activity and the introduction of the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an expert institution.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is the only one in the country and is located in her Center.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}} No one had ever had such a monopoly.{{sfn|Savenko|2004a}}

According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center has long labored to legalize its monopolistic position of the Main expert institution of the country.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center to get in touch over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have turned out to be a considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.{{sfn|Clark|2014}}

On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko wrote to the then [[President of the Russian Federation]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] an [[open letter]], in which Savenko asked Medvedev to submit to the [[State Duma]] a draft law prepared by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization.{{sfn|Savenko|2009c|p=5–6}} The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped to such an extent that it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise.{{sfn|Savenko|2009c|p=5–6}} According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural rules, do not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.{{sfn|Savenko|2009c|p=5–6}}

On 15 June 2009, the working group chaired by the Director of the Serbsky Center Tatyana Dmitrieva sent the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]] a joint application whose purport was to declare appealing against the forensic expert reports of state expert institutions illegal and prohibit courts from receiving lawsuits filed to appeal against the reports.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} The reason put forward for the proposal was that the appeals against the expert reports were allegedly filed "without regard for the scope of the case" and that one must appeal against the expert report "only together with the sentence."{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} In other words, according to Yuri Savenko, all professional errors and omissions are presented as untouchable by virtue of the fact that they were infiltrated into the sentence.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} That is cynicism of administrative resources, cynicism of power, he says.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}}

The draft of the application to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was considered in the paper "Current legal issues relevant to forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation" by [[Elena Shchukina]] and [[Sergei Shishkov]]{{sfn|Shchukina|Shishkov|2009|p=24–28}} focusing on the inadmissibility of appealing against the expert report without regard for the scope of the evaluated case.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} While talking about appealing against "the reports", the authors of the paper, according to lawyer [[Dmitry Bartenev]], mistakenly identify the reports with actions of the experts (or an expert institution) and justify the impossibility of the "parallel" examination and evaluation of the actions of the experts without regard for the scope of the evaluated case.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}} Such a conclusion made by the authors appears clearly erroneous because abuse by the experts of rights and legitimate interests of citizens including trial participants, of course, may be a subject for a separate appeal.{{sfn|Savenko|Bartenev|2010}}

According to the warning made in 2010 by Yuri Savenko at the same Congress, prof. [[Anatoly Smulevich]], author of the monographs ''Problema Paranoyi'' (''The Problem of Paranoia'') (1972) and ''Maloprogredientnaya Shizofreniya'' (''Continuous Sluggish Schizophrenia'') (1987), which had contributed to the hyperdiagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia", again began to play the same role he played before.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} Recently, under his influence therapists began to widely use [[antidepressants]] and [[antipsychotics]] but often in inadequate cases and in inappropriate doses, without consulting psychiatrists.{{sfn|Savenko|2010|pp=13–17}} This situation has opened up a huge new market for [[pharmaceutical firms]], with their unlimited capabilities, and the flow of the mentally ill to internists.{{sfn|Savenko|2010}} Smulevich bases the diagnosis of continuous sluggish schizophrenia, in particular, on appearance and lifestyle and stresses that the forefront in the picture of negative changes is given to the contrast between retaining mental activity (and sometimes quite high capacity for work) and mannerism, unusualness of one's appearance and entire lifestyle.{{sfn|Smulevich|2009}}

According to the commentary by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia on the 2007 text by Vladimir Rotstein, a doctrinist of Snezhnevsky's school, there are sufficient patients with delusion of reformism in psychiatric inpatient facilities for involuntary treatment.{{sfn|NPZ|2007b}} In 2012, delusion of reformism was mentioned as a symptom of mental disorder in ''Psychiatry. National Manual'' edited by Tatyana Dmitrieva, Valery Krasnov, Nikolai Neznanov, Valentin Semke, and Alexander Tiganov.{{sfn|Dmitrieva|Krasnov|Neznanov|2012|p=322}} In the same year, Vladimir Pashkovsky in his paper reported that he diagnosed 4.7 percent of 300 patients with delusion of reform.{{sfn|Pashkovsky|2012}} As Russian sociologist [[Alexander Tarasov]] notes, you will be treated in a hospital so that you and all your acquaintances get to learn forever that only such people as [[Anatoly Chubais]] or [[German Gref]] can be occupied with reforming in our country; and you are suffering from "syndrome of litigiousness" if in addition you wrote to the capital city complaints, which can be written only by a reviewing authority or lawyer.{{sfn|Tarasov|2006|p=159}}

According to Doctor of Legal Sciences Vladimir Ovchinsky, regional differences in forensic psychiatric expert reports are striking.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}} For example, in some regions of Russia, 8 or 9 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane; in other regions up to 75 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}} In some regions less than 2 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics; in other regions up to 80 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics.{{sfn|Ovchinsky|2010}}

In April 1995, the State Duma considered the first draft of a law that would have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President, the Prime Minister, and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions.{{sfn|Bonnie|Polubinskaya|1999}} In 2002, Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised about the use of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country.{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=85}} Obviously, one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter, she said, though is it worthwhile to substitute experts' medical reports for elections?{{sfn|Korotenko|Alikina|2002|p=85}} In 2003, the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by [[Alexander Podrabinek]], author of the book ''Punitive Medicine'',{{sfn|Luty|2014}} a 265-page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Scarnati|1980}} He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event of inappropriate behavior.{{sfn|Gorelik|2003}} Concerned about the problem, authorities ruled that the [[Russian Mental Health Law]] should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with [[parliamentary immunity|parliamentary]] or [[judicial immunity]].{{sfn|Asriyants|Chernova|2010}} A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asriyants|Chernova|2010}}; {{harvnb|NPZ|2007a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one's marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms and that there are statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities.{{sfn|Mishina|2011}}

== Documents and memoirs ==
The evidence for the misuse of psychiatry for political purposes in the Soviet Union was documented in a number of articles and books.{{sfn|Bloch|1980}} Several national psychiatric associations examined and acted upon this documentation.{{sfn|Bloch|1980}}

'''Public health genomics''' is the use of [[genomics]] information to benefit [[public health]]. This is visualized as more effective [[preventive care]] and disease treatments with better [[Specificity (statistics)|specificity]], tailored to the genetic makeup of each patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phgen.nrw.de/typo3/fileadmin/downloads/ManualVersand_Bellagio_Report-230106.pdf |title=Genome-based Research and  Population Health |author=Bellagio Group on Public Health Genomics |accessdate=3 September 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107063814/http://www.phgen.nrw.de/typo3/fileadmin/downloads/ManualVersand_Bellagio_Report-230106.pdf |archivedate=January 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (U.S.), Public Health genomics is an emerging [[field of study]] that assesses the impact of genes and their interaction with behavior, diet and the environment on the population’s health.&lt;ref name="CDC" /&gt;

This field of public health genomics is less than a decade old. A number of think tanks, universities, and governments (including the U.S., UK, and Australia) have started public health genomics projects. Research on the [[human genome]] is generating new knowledge that is changing public health programs and policies. Advances in genomic sciences are increasingly being used to improve health, prevent disease, educate and train the public health workforce, other healthcare providers, and citizens.

==Public policy==

[[Public policy]] has protected people against [[genetic discrimination]], defined in ''[[Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary]]'' (2001) as unequal treatment of persons with either known genetic abnormalities or the inherited propensity for disease; genetic discrimination may have a negative effect on employability, insurability and other socio-economic variables. [[Public policy of the United States|Public policy in the U.S.]] that protect individuals and groups of people against genetic discrimination include the [[Americans with Disabilities Act|Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]], {{Executive Order|13145}} (2000) that prohibits genetic discrimination in the workplace for federal employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/12513983 |title=A Time-Line of Genetic Discrimination Legislation, 1990-2005 |accessdate=3 September 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324111458/http://www.genome.gov/12513983 |archivedate=March 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act|Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008]].

Main public concerns regarding genomic information are that of confidentiality, misuse of information by health plans, employers, and medical practitioners, and the [[Freedom of information|right of access to genetic information]].

==Ethical concerns==
One of the many facets involved in public health genomics is that of [[bioethics]]. This has been highlighted in a study in 2005 by Cogent Research, that found when American citizens were asked what they thought the strongest drawback was in using genetic information, they listed "misuse of information/invasion of privacy" as the single most important problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/display/?id=294054 |title=New Survey Shows Americans Want Genetic Information in Health Care, But Fear Privacy, Ethical, Emotional Implications |date=3 November 2005 |accessdate=3 September 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522035534/http://www.redorbit.com/news/display/?id=294054 |archivedate=May 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] published a report, ''Pharmacogenetics: Ethical Issues''. Authors of the document explore four broad categories of ethical and policy issues related to [[pharmacogenetics]]: information, resource, equity and control. In the introduction to the report, the authors clearly state that the development and application of pharmacogenetics depend on [[scientific research]], but that policy and administration must provide incentives and restraints to ensure the most productive and just use of this technology.&lt;ref name="ethical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/go/ourwork/pharmacogenetics/publication_314.html |title=Pharmacogenetics: Ethical Issues |author=Nuffield Council on Bioethics |date=20 September 2003 |accessdate=3 September 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303020500/http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/go/ourwork/pharmacogenetics/publication_314.html |archivedate=March 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic susceptibility to disease==
[[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|Single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) are single [[Nucleobase|bases]] within a [[gene sequence]] that differ from that gene's [[consensus sequence]], and are present in a subset of the population. SNPs may have no effect on [[gene expression]], or they can change the function of a gene completely. Resulting gene expression changes can, in some cases, result in disease, or in susceptibility to disease (e.g., viral or bacterial infection).

Some current tests for genetic diseases include: [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Tay–Sachs disease|Tay-Sachs disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[Huntington's disease|Huntington’s disease]], [[High Cholesterol|high cholesterol]], some rare cancers and an inherited susceptibility to cancer. A select few are explored below.

===Herpesvirus and bacterial infections===
Since the field of genomics takes into account the entire genome of an [[organism]], and not simply its individual genes, the stud  of [[latent viral infection]] falls into this realm. For example, the [[DNA]] of a latent [[herpesvirus]] integrates into the host’s [[chromosome]] and propagates through [[cell replication]], although it is not part of the organism's genome, and was not present at the birth of the individual.

An example of this is found in a study published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], which showed that mice with a latent infection of a herpesvirus were less susceptible to bacterial infections. [[murine|Murine mice]] were infected with murine [[Gammaherpesvirinae|gammaherpesvirus]] 68 and then challenged with the ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'' bacterium. Mice that had a latent infection of the [[virus]] had an increased resistance to the bacteria, but those with a non-latent strain of virus had no change in susceptibility to the bacteria. The study went on to test mice with murine [[cytomegalovirus]], a member of the [[betaherpesvirinae]] subfamily, which provided similar results.  However, infection with human [[herpes simplex virus]] type-1 (HSV-1), a member of the [[alphaherpesvirinae]] subfamily, did not provide increased resistance to bacterial infection.  They also used ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' (the [[causative agent]] of the [[Black Death]]) to challenge mice with a latent infection of gammaherpesvirus 68, and they found the mice did have an increased resistance to the bacteria. The suspected reason for this is that [[Peritoneum|peritoneal]] [[macrophages]] in the mouse are activated after latent infection of the herpesvirus, and since macrophages play an important role in [[immune system|immunity]], this provides the mouse with a stronger, active immune system at the time of bacterial exposure.  It was found that the latent herpesvirus caused an increase in [[interferon-gamma]] (IFN-γ) and [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (TNF-α), [[Cytokine|cytokines]] which both lead to activation of macrophages and resistance to bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Herpesvirus latency confers symbiotic protection from bacterial infection|journal=Nature|date=17 May 2007|volume=447 | issue = 7142 |pages=326–9|pmid=17507983|doi=10.1038/nature05762|vauthors=Barton ES, White DW, Cathelyn JS |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influenza and ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''===
Variations within the human genome can be studied to determine susceptibility to infectious diseases.  The study of variations within microbial genomes will also need to be evaluated to use genomics of infectious disease within public health.  The ability to determine if a person has greater susceptibility to an infectious disease will be valuable to determine how to treat the disease if it is present or prevent the person from getting the disease.  Several infectious diseases have shown a link between genetics and susceptibility in that families tend to have heritability traits of a disease.

During the course of the past{{When|date=August 2018}} influenza [[pandemics]] and the current{{When|date=August 2018}} influenza [[epizootic]] there has been evidence of family clusters of disease.  Kandun, et al. found that family clusters in [[Indonesia]] in 2005 resulted in mild, severe and fatal cases among family members.  The findings from this study raise questions about genetic or other predispositions and how they affect a persons susceptibility to and severity of disease.  Continued research will be needed to determine the [[epidemiology]] of [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1]] infection and whether genetic, behavioral, immunologic, and environmental factors contribute to case clustering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Three Indonesian clusters of H5N1 virus infection in 2005|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=23 November 2006|volume=355 | issue = 21 |pages=2186–2194|pmid=17124016|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa060930|vauthors=Kandun IN, Wibisono H, Sedyaningsih ER |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Host (biology)|Host]] genetic factors play a major role in determining differential susceptibility to major infectious diseases of humans.  Infectious diseases in humans appear highly [[polygenic]] with many [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] implicated but only a minority of these convincingly replicated.&lt;ref name="aspects"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aspects of genetic susceptibility to human infectious diseases|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|date=December 2006|volume=40|pages=469–486|pmid=17094741|doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.40.110405.090546|author=Hill AV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of time, humans have been exposed to organisms like ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  It is possible that the human genome has evolved in part from our exposure to ''M. tuberculosis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Human and tuberculosis co-evolution: An integrative view|journal=Tuberculosis|date=June 2015|volume=95 Suppl 1|pages=S112–S116|pmid=25841342|doi=10.1016/j.tube.2015.02.016|author=Perrin P}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Animal model]] studies and whole genome screens can be used to identify potential regions on a gene that suggest evidence of tuberculosis susceptibility.  In the case of ''M. tuberculosis,'' animal model studies were used to suggest evidence of a [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] which was correlated with susceptibility, further studies were done to prove the link between the suggested locus and susceptibility.  The genetic loci that have been identified as associated with susceptibility to [[tuberculosis]] are [[HLA-DR]], INF-γ, [[SLC11A1]], [[VDR (gene)|''VDR'']], MAL/[[TIRAP]], and [[CCL2]].&lt;ref name="aspects" /&gt; Further studies will be needed to determine genetic susceptibility to other infectious diseases and ways public health officials can prevent and test for these infections to enhance the concept of [[personalized medicine]].

===Type 1 Diabetes, immunomics, and public health===
The term genomics, referring to the organism’s whole genome, is also used to refer to gene informatics, or the collection and storage of genetic data, including the functional information associated with the genes, and the analysis of the data as combinations, patterns and networks by computer algorithms. [[Systems biology]] and genomics are natural partners, since the development of genomic information and systems naturally facilitates analysis of systems biology questions involving relationships between genes, their variants (SNPs) and biological function. Such questions include the investigation of [[signaling pathways]], [[evolutionary trees]], or [[Biological network|biological networks]], such as [[Immune network theory|immune networks]] and pathways. For this reason, genomics and these approaches are particularly suited to studies in immunology. The study of immunology using genomics, as well as [[proteomics]] and transcriptomics (including gene profiles, either genomic or expressed gene [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] profiles), has been termed [[immunomics]].

Accurate and sensitive prediction of disease, or detection during early stages of disease, could allow the prevention or arrest of disease development as [[immunotherapy]] treatments become available. [[Type-1 diabetes]] markers associated with disease susceptibility have been identified, for example [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] class II gene variants, however possession of one or more of these genomic markers does not necessarily lead to disease. Lack of progression to disease is likely due to the absence of [[environmental triggers]], absence of other susceptibility genes, presence of protective genes, or differences in the temporal expression or presence of these factors.  Combinations of markers have also been associated with susceptibility to type-1 diabetes however again, their presence may not always predict disease development, and conversely, disease may be present without the marker group. Potential variant genes (SNPs) or markers that are linked to the disease include genes for cytokines, membrane-bound [[Ligand|ligands]], [[insulin]] and immune regulatory genes.

Meta-analyses have been able to identify additional associated genes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Seven regions of the genome show evidence of linkage to type 1 diabetes in a consensus analysis of 767 multiplex families|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=October 2001|last=Cox et. al.|first=N. J.|volume=69|issue=4|pages=820–830|pmid=11507694|doi=10.1086/323501|pmc=1226067}}&lt;/ref&gt; by pooling a number of large gene datasets. This successful study illustrates the importance of compiling and sharing large genome databases. The inclusion of phenotypic data in these databases will enhance discovery of candidate genes, while the addition of environmental and temporal data should be able to advance the disease progression pathways knowledge. HUGENet, which was initiated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (U.S.), is accomplishing the integration of this type of information with the genome data, in a form available for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The path from genome-based research to population health: development of an international public health genomics network.|journal=Genetics in Medicine|last=Burke et. al.|first=W|date=July 2006|volume=8 | issue = 7 |pages=451–8|pmid=16845279|doi=10.1097/01.gim.0000228213.72256.8c}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project could be thought of as an example of ‘[[metagenomics]]’, the analysis of a community’s genome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Science of Metagenomics: Revealing the Secrets of Our Microbial Planet|date=24 May 2007|isbn=978-0309106764|last1=Council|first1=National Research|last2=Studies|first2=Division on Earth Life|last3=Sciences|first3=Board on Life|last4=Applications|first4=Committee on Metagenomics: Challenges Functional}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for a human rather than a microbial community.  This project is intended to promote international data sharing and collaboration, in addition to creating a standard and framework for the collection of this data.

===Nonsyndromic hearing loss===
Variations within the human genome are being studied to determine susceptibility to chronic diseases, as well as infectious diseases. According to Aileen Kenneson and Coleen Boyle, about one sixth of the U.S. population has some degree of [[hearing loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khoury et. al.|first=MJ|title=Human Genome Epidemiology: A Scientific Foundation for Using Genetic Information to Improve Health and Prevent Disease|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2003|pages=423–435|isbn=978-0195146745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has linked variants in the ''gap junction beta 2'' (''[[GJB2]]'') gene to nonsyndromic prelingual [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. ''GJB2'' is a gene encoding for [[connexin]], a protein found in the [[cochlea]]. Scientists have found over 90 variants in this gene and sequence variations may account for up to 50% of nonsyndromic hearing loss. Variants in ''GJB2'' are being used to determine [[age of onset]], as well as [[Severity of illness|severity]] of hearing loss.

It is clear that there are also environmental factors to consider. Infections such as [[rubella]] and [[meningitis]] and [[low birth weight]] and [[artificial ventilation]], are known risk factors for hearing loss, but perhaps knowing this, as well as genetic information, will help with early intervention.

Information gained from further research in the role of ''GJB2'' variants in hearing loss may lead to [[newborn screening]] for them. As early intervention is crucial to prevent developmental delays in children with hearing loss, the ability to test for susceptibility in young children would be beneficial. Knowing genetic information may also help in the treatment of other diseases if a patient is already at risk.

Further testing is needed, especially in determining the role of ''GJB2'' variants and environmental factors on a population level, however initial studies show promise when using genetic information along with newborn screening.

== Genomics and health ==

=== Pharmacogenomics ===
{{Main|Pharmacogenomics}}
The World Health Organization has defined [[pharmacogenomics]] as the study of DNA sequence variation as it relates to different drug responses in individuals, i.e., the use of genomics to determine an individual’s response. Pharmacogenomics refers to the use of DNA-based genotyping in order to target pharmaceutical agents to specific patient populations in the design of drugs.&lt;ref name="ethical" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/genomics/elsi/pharmacogenomics/en/|title=Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) of human genomics|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current estimates state that 2 million hospital patients are affected by adverse drug reactions every year and [[adverse drug events]] are the fourth leading cause of death. These adverse drug reactions result in an estimated economic cost of $136 billion per year. [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]] (genetic variations) in individuals affect [[drug metabolism]] and therefore an individual's response to a medication. Examples of ways in which genetics may affect an individual’s response to drugs include: drug transporters, [[metabolism]] and [[Drug interaction|drug interactions]]. Pharmacogenetics may be used in the near future by public health practitioners to determine the best candidates for certain drugs, thereby reducing much of the guesswork in prescribing drugs. Such actions have the potential to improve the effectiveness of treatments and reduce adverse drug events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2003/misc/116726.pdf|title=Genomics and Its Impact on Science and Society - Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrition and health ===
Nutrition is very important in determining various states of health. The field of [[nutrigenomics]] is based on the idea that everything ingested into a person’s body affects the genome of the individual.  This may be through either upregulating or downregulating the expression of certain genes or by a number of other methods.  While the field is quite young there are a number of companies that market directly to the public and promote the issue under the guise of public health.  Yet many of these companies claim to benefit the consumer, the tests performed are either not applicable or often result in common sense recommendations.  Such companies promote public distrust towards future medical tests that may test more appropriate and applicable agents.

An example of the role of nutrition would be the [[methylation]] pathway involving [[Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase|methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase]] (MTHFR). An individual with the SNP may need increased supplementation of [[vitamin B12]] and [[folate]] to override the effect of a variant SNP. Increased risk for [[Neural tube defect|neural tube defects]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) allele frequencies in Amerindians|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|date=July 2003|volume=67|issue=Pt 4|pages=367–371|pmid=12914571|doi=10.1046/j.1469-1809.2003.00027.x|author=Monsalve MV, Salzano FM, Rupert JL, Hutz MH, Hill K, Hurtado AM, Hochachka PW, Devine DV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elevated [[homocysteine]] levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hyperhomocysteine, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene, and other risk factors in ischemic stroke|journal=Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi|date=25 January 2002|volume=82 | issue = 2 |pages=119–122|pmid=11953142|author=Huang Y, Zhao Yl Yl, Li S}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been associated with the MTHFR [[C677T]] polymorphism.

In 2002, researchers from the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] identified the blueprint of genes and enzymes in the body that enable [[sulforaphane]], a compound found in broccoli and other vegetables, to prevent cancer and remove toxins from cells. The discovery was made using a “[[gene chip]],” which allows researchers to monitor the complex interactions of thousands of proteins on a whole genome rather than one at time. This study was the first gene profiling analysis of a cancer-preventing agent using this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2002/broccoli-genes.html|title=Researchers Identify First Genomic Blueprint of Cancer-Preventive Compound Found in Broccoli|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Identification of Nrf2-regulated Genes Induced by the Chemopreventive Agent Sulforaphane by Oligonucleotide Microarray|last=Thimmulappa et. al.|first=Rajesh K.|journal=Cancer Research|volume=62 | issue = 18 |pages=5196–5203|date=15 September 2002|pmid=12234984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Minnesota]] researcher Sabrina Peterson, coauthored a study with Johanna Lampe of the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], Seattle, in October 2002 that investigated the [[Chemoprotective agent|chemoprotective]] effect of [[cruciferous vegetables]] (e.g., broccoli, brussels sprouts). Study results published in [[Journal of Nutrition|The Journal of Nutrition]] outline the metabolism and mechanisms of action of cruciferous vegetable constituents, discusses human studies testing effects of cruciferous vegetables on [[biotransformation]] systems and summarizes the epidemiologic and experimental evidence for an effect of genetic polymorphisms (genetic variations) in these enzymes in response to cruciferous vegetable intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brassica, Biotransformation and Cancer Risk: Genetic Polymorphisms Alter the Preventive Effects of Cruciferous Vegetables|last=Lampe et. al.|first=Johanna W.|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=132 | issue = 10 |pages=2991–2994|date=October 2002|pmid=12368383|doi=10.1093/jn/131.10.2991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare and genomics ===
Members of the public are continually asking how obtaining their genetic blueprint will benefit them, and why they find that they are more susceptible to diseases that have no [[cure]]s.

Researchers have found that almost all disorders and diseases that affect [[humans]] reflect the interplay between the environment and their genes; however we are still in the initial stages of understanding the specific role genes play on common disorders and diseases.&lt;ref name="Reilly"&gt;{{cite book|title=Is it in Your Genes? The Influence of Genes on Common Disorders and Diseases That Affect You and Your Family|last=Reilly|first=Philip|date=2004|location=New York|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|isbn=978-0879697198}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, while news reports may give a different impression, most cancer is not inherited.  It is therefore likely that the recent rise in the rates of cancer worldwide can be at least partially attributed to the rise in the number of synthetic and otherwise toxic compounds found in our society today.  Thus, in the near future, public health genomics, and more specifically environmental health, will become an important part of the future healthcare-related issues.

Potential benefits of uncovering the human genome will be focused more on identifying causes of disease and less on treating disease, through: improved diagnostic methods, earlier detection of a predisposing genetic variation, pharmacogenomics and [[gene therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/benefits.shtml|title=ARCHIVE: Potential Benefits of HGP Research|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each individual, the experience of discovering and knowing their genetic make-up will be different.  For some individuals, they will be given the assurance of not obtaining a disease, as a result of familial genes, in which their family has a strong history and some will be able to seek out better medicines or therapies for a disease they already have.  Others will find they are more susceptible to a disease that has no cure.  Though this information maybe painful, it will give them the opportunity to prevent or delay the on-set of that disease through: increased education of the disease, making [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes, finding preventive therapies or identifying environmental triggers of the disease.  As we continue to have advances in the study of human genetics, we hope to one day incorporate it into the day-to-day practice of healthcare.  Understanding one's own genetic blueprint can empower oneself to take an active role in promoting their own health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graphint.org/docs/2006-08-burke.pdf |title=The path from genome-based research to population health: Development of an international public health genomics network |date=July 2006 |accessdate=3 September 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710003400/http://www.graphint.org/docs/2006-08-burke.pdf |archivedate=July 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genomics and understanding of disease susceptibility can help validate family history tool for use by practitioners and the public. IOM is validating the family history tool for six common chronic diseases (breast, ovarian, colorectal cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke) (IOM Initiative). Validating cost effective tools can help restore importance of basic medical practices (e.g. family history) in comparission to technology intensive investigations.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/about/reports/2005/letter.htm|title=Genomics and Population Health 2005|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The genomic face of immune responses===
A critical set of phenomena that ties together various aspects of health interventions, such as drug sensitivity screening, cancer or autoimmune susceptibility screening, infectious disease prevalence and application of pharmacologic or nutrition therapies, is the systems biology of the immune response.  For example, the influenza epidemic of 1918, as well as the recent cases of human fatality due to H5N1 (avian flu), both illustrate the potentially dangerous sequence of immune responses to this virus.  Also well documented is the only case of spontaneous "immunity" to HIV in humans, shown to be due to a mutation in a surface protein on CD4 T cells, the primary targets of HIV.  The immune system is truly a sentinel system of the body, with the result that health and disease are carefully balanced by the modulated response of each of its various parts, which then also act in concert as a whole.  Especially in industrialized and rapidly developing economies, the high rate of allergic and reactive respiratory disease, autoimmune conditions and cancers are also in part linked to aberrant immune responses that are elicited as the communities' genomes encounter swiftly changing environments. The causes of perturbed immune responses run the gamut of genome-environment interactions due to diet, supplements, sun exposure, workplace exposures, etc.  Public health genomics as a whole will absolutely require a rigorous understanding of the changing face of immune responses.

===Newborn screening===
The experience of [[newborn screening]] serves as the introduction to public health genomics for many people.  If they did not undergo prenatal genetic testing, having their new baby undergo a heel stick in order to collect a small amount of blood may be the first time an individual or couple encounters genetic testing.  Newborn genetic screening is a promising area in public health genomics that appears poised to capitalize on the public health goal of disease prevention as a primary form of treatment.

Most of the diseases that are screened for are extremely rare, single-gene disorders that are often [[autosomal recessive]] conditions and are not readily identifiable in neonates without these types of tests.  Therefore, often the treating physician has never seen a patient with the disease or condition and so an immediate referral to a specialty clinic is necessary for the family.

Most of the conditions identified in newborn screening are [[metabolic disorders]] that either involve i) lacking an enzyme or the ability to metabolize (or breakdown) a particular component of the diet, like phenylketonuria, ii) abnormality of some component of the blood, especially the [[hemoglobin]] protein, or iii) alteration of some component of the [[endocrine system]], especially the [[thyroid]] gland.  Many of these disorders, once identified, can be treated before more severe symptoms, such as [[mental retardation]] or stunted growth, set in.

Newborn genetic screening is an area of tremendous growth.  In the early 1960s, the only test was for [[phenylketonuria]].  In 2000, roughly two-thirds of states in the US screened for 10 or fewer genetic diseases in newborns.  Notably, in 2007, 95% of states in the US screen for more than 30 different genetic diseases in newborns.   Especially as costs have come down, newborn genetic screening offers “an excellent return on the expenditure of public health dollars.”&lt;ref name="Reilly" /&gt;

=== Understanding traditional healing practices ===
Genomics will help develop an understanding of the practices that have evolved over centuries in old civilizations and which have been strengthened by observations (phenotype presentations) from generation to generation, but which lack documentation and scientific evidence. Traditional healers associated specific body types with resistance or susceptibility to particular diseases under specific conditions. Validation and standardization of this knowledge/ practices has not yet been done by modern science. Genomics, by associating genotypes with the phenotypes on which these practices were based, could provide key tools to advance the scientific understanding of some of these traditional healing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Syndrome differentiation in traditional Chinese medicine and E-cadherin/ICAM-1 gene protein expression in gastric carcinoma|journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology|last=Sun et. al.|first=DZ|date=28 August 2007|volume=13 | issue = 32 |pages=4321–4327|pmid=17708604|doi=10.3748/wjg.v13.i32.4321|pmc=4250857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Richardson Olmsted Campus''' in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]] was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cris.parks.ny.gov/|title=Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS)|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]|format=Searchable database|accessdate=2016-04-01}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web|url=https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&amp;id=29548&amp;q=false|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Buffalo State Hospital|date=August 1972|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-04-01|author=T.

Over the years, as mental health treatment changed and resources were diverted, the buildings and grounds began a slow deterioration. In 2006, the Richardson Center Corporation was formed with a mandate to save the buildings and bring the Campus back to life through a State appropriation for this architectural treasure.

Today, the Richardson Olmsted Campus is being transformed into a cultural amenity for the city, beginning with the now open Hotel Henry Urban Resort Conference Center and 100 Acres: The Kitchens at Hotel Henry, both nestled within the iconic Towers Building and two flanking buildings (about one-third of the Campus). Arriving in 2018, the Richardson Olmsted Campus will also welcome the Lipsey Architecture Center of Buffalo. The remaining buildings have been stabilized pending future opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.richardson-olmsted.com/|title=The Richardson Olmsted Campus|website=www.richardson-olmsted.com|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hotel Henry Urban Resort Conference Center==
Opened in April 2017, Hotel Henry Urban Resort Conference Center is the first phase and 1/3 of the redevelopment of the Richardson Olmsted Campus, bringing new life and meaning to the National Historic Landmark. The original-concept hotel features 88 guest rooms and suites with full-service amenities and seamlessly integrated technology. The Urban Resort amenities span throughout the surrounding Buffalo neighborhoods and the property boasts over 20,000 square feet of adaptable meeting &amp; event spaces. 100 Acres: The Kitchens at Hotel Henry stands on Hotel Henry's first floor, welcoming hotel guests and the surrounding Buffalo neighborhoods to enjoy a selectively-sourced, seasonal New American menu.

==Architecture==

The large Medina red sandstone and brick hospital buildings were designed in 1870 in the [[Kirkbride Plan]] by architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] with grounds by landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]].&lt;ref&gt;Carla Yanni, The Architecture of Madness: Insane Asylums in the United States (University of Minnesota Press, 2007) 127-139.&lt;/ref&gt; The campus consists of a central administrative tower and five pavilions or wards progressively set back on each side, for eleven buildings total, all connected by short curved two-story corridors. Patients were segregated by sex, males on the east side, females on the west.  The wards housed patients until the mid-1970s.  The central administration building was used for offices until 1994.  In 1973, the Asylum was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and in 1986, it was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

The campus, the largest commission of Richardson's career, marks the advent of his characteristic [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style. When emulated by later architects, this style is referred to as [[Richardsonian Romanesque]].  It has been the subject of a long-term preservation campaign.  Nevertheless, three pavilions on the east side were demolished in the 1970s to make way for newer psychiatric facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalospree.com/buffalospreemagazine/archives/2000_0304/030400architecture.html Archives: Architecture: A towering masterpiece: H.H.

==Records and Drawings==

Patient records from 1881 to 1975 are in the collection of the New York State Archives in Albany, NY.

==Preservation Efforts==

A successful lawsuit filed by the Preservation Coalition of Erie County (renamed "Preservation Buffalo Niagara" in October 2008) forced the State of New York to commit $100 million to its rehabilitation.  Both former [[New York State Assembly]] Member [[Sam Hoyt]] and former [[Buffalo State College]] President [[Muriel A. Howard]] were actively involved in plans for the restoration and reuse of the Richardson.&lt;ref name="Restoration"&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/381597679? Hoyt proposes civic panel for Richardson site], ''Buffalo News'', Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 22 January 2004, Sommer, M., Retrieved 15 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the State established the Richardson Center Corporation in 2006 to rehabilitate the site.  Perimeter fencing and lighting have been installed and a [[Peace Officer]] is on duty at all times to conduct regular patrols of the area to prevent and deter crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.richardson-olmsted.com/learn/stabilization/|title=Stabilization &gt; Learn &gt; The Richardson Olmsted Campus|website=www.richardson-olmsted.com|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HH Richardson Complex.jpg|thumb|200px|South elevation of the Administration Building in 1965.]]

On March 5, 2008, stabilization began with the most severely damaged buildings, including the roof and down-spouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/cityregion/story/291819.html |title=Repairs underway at H.H. Richardson complex |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306181124/http://www.buffalonews.com/cityregion/story/291819.html |archivedate=March 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stabilization was completed in 2012.&lt;ref name="richardson-olmsted.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.richardson-olmsted.com/learn/timeline/|title=Reuse Timeline &gt; Learn &gt; The Richardson Olmsted Campus|website=www.richardson-olmsted.com|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2010, a two-alarm fire occurred. The cause of the fire was under investigation. Damage was estimated at $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wivb.com/dpp/news/local/Flames-break-out-at-closed-psych-center|title=Flames break out at closed psych center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the South Lawn landscape on the property was completed.  The re-greening of the nine-acre South Lawn transformed two large parking lots at the Campus' south entry into a welcoming space for community gathering and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.richardson-olmsted.com/learn/south-lawn/|title=South Lawn &gt; Learn &gt; The Richardson Olmsted Campus|website=www.richardson-olmsted.com|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At every stage of planning, the Richardson Center Corporation has used an active public process, which has helped to inform the [http://www.richardson-olmsted.com/learn/planning-and-reports/ Master Plan] and all phases of redevelopment for the Campus.  Ten public meetings have taken place since 2007 to inform the planning and reuse.  A Community Advisory Group includes representatives from the adjacent neighborhoods, business districts, cultural institutions, Buffalo Psychiatric Center, SUNY Buffalo State, and historic preservation groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.richardson-olmsted.com/support/community/|title=Community &gt; Support &gt; The Richardson Olmsted Campus|website=www.richardson-olmsted.com|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and game use==

In 1983 a portion of a ground floor hallway and one hospital room were prepared to appear as a maternity ward and used as a location for [[The Natural (film)|The Natural]], where the character Roy Hobbs, as played by [[Robert Redford]], was shown recovering from internal injuries. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Mount Massive Asylum from [[Outlast]] was modeled based on the Richardson Olmsted Complex.

==Adaptive Reuse==

On January 25, 2013, Phase I plans were announced to redevelop 1/3 of the Campus into Hotel Henry Urban Resort Conference Center, 100 Acres: The Kitchens at Hotel Henry and the Buffalo Architecture Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/01252013-richardson-olmsted-complex-redevelopment|title=Governor Cuomo Announces First Phase of Redevelopment of Richardson Olmsted Campus In Buffalo|publisher=State of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This first phase of redevelopment was completed in 2016. Hotel Henry opened in May 2017, and the architecture center will open later in 2017.&lt;ref name="richardson-olmsted.com"/&gt;

'''Sports nutrition''' is the study and practice of [[nutrition]] and [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] with regards to improving anyone's athletic performance. Nutrition is an important part of many sports training regimens, being popular in strength sports (such as [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] and [[bodybuilding]]) and endurance sports (e.g. [[cycling]], [[running]], [[Human swimming|swimming]], [[rowing]]). Sports Nutrition focuses its studies on the type, as well as the quantity of fluids and food taken by an athlete. In addition, it deals with the consumption of nutrients such as [[vitamins]], [[minerals]], [[Dietary supplement|supplements]] and [[Organic compound|organic]] substances that include [[carbohydrates]], [[proteins]] and [[fat]]s.

==Supplements==
Dietary supplements contain one or more dietary ingredients (including vitamins; minerals; amino acids; herbs or other botanicals; and other substances) or their constituents is intended to be taken by mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid.&lt;ref&gt;"Background Information: Dietary Supplements — Health Professional Fact Sheet." U.S National Library of Medicine. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 24 June 2011. Web. 04 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes may choose to consider taking [[dietary supplement]]s to assist in improving their athletic performance.&lt;ref name="Maughan, Ronald J. 20012"&gt;Maughan, Ronald J., ed. "Sports Nutrition: What Is It?" Journal of Nutrition &amp; Physical Activity 17 (2001). 2001. Elsevier Science Inc. 25 Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other supplements out there that include performance enhancing supplements (steroids, blood doping, creatine, human growth hormone), energy supplements (caffeine), and supplements that aid in recovery (protein, BCAAs).

=== Energy supplements ===
Athletes sometimes turn to energy supplements to increase their ability to exercise more often. Common supplements to increase an athlete's energy include: Caffeine, Guarana, Vitamin B12, and Asian ginseng.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/prevention-15/vitamins/energy-boosting-supplements|title=Energy Boosters: Can Supplements and Vitamins Help?|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caffeine, a common energy supplement, can be found in many different forms such as pills, tablets or capsules, and can also be found in common foods, such as coffee and tea. Caffeine is used to improve energy and increases metabolism. Guarana is another supplement that athletes take to enhance their athletic ability, it is frequently used for weight loss and as an energy supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-935-guarana.aspx?activeingredientid=935|title=GUARANA: Uses, Side Effects, Interactions and Warnings - WebMD|website=www.webmd.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study from the [[University of Texas]] reports that caffeinated energy drinks decrease sporting performance. They found that after drinking an energy drink, 83% of participants improved their physical activity parameters by an average of 4.7%. This was attributed to the effects of caffeine, sucrose and Vitamin B in the drink - however scientific consensus does not support the efficacy of using Vitamin B as a performance enhancer. To explain the performance improvement the writers report an increase in blood levels of [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[beta-Endorphin]]. The adenosine receptor antagonism of caffeine accounts for the first two,&lt;ref&gt;[[Caffeine#Pharmacodynamics]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} while the latter is accounted for by the [[Neurobiological effects of physical exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;"Improved Cycling Time-Trial Performance After Ingestion of a Caffeine Energy Drink." International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism 19 (February 2009): 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caffeine]] has been around since the 1900s and became popularly used in the 1970s when its power of masking fatigue became highly recognized.&lt;ref name="ApplegateElizabeth2" /&gt; Similarly, the caffeine found in energy drinks and coffee shows an increased reaction performance and feelings of energy, focus and alertness in quickness and reaction anaerobic power tests. In other words, consuming an energy drink or any drink with caffeine increases short time/rapid exercise performance (like short full-speed sprints and heavy power weight lifting).&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Jay R., Jie Kang, Nicholas A. Ratamess, Mattan W. Hoffman, Christopher P. Tranchina, and Avery D. Faigenbaum. "Examination of a pre-exercise, high energy supplement on exercise performance." Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 6 (2009). Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition. 6 Jan. 2009. BioMed Central Ltd. 25 Mar. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Caffeine is chemically similar to adenosine, a type of sugar that helps in the regulation of important body processes, including the firing of neurotransmitters. Caffeine takes the place of adenosine in your brain, attaching itself to the same neural receptors affected by adenosine, and causing your neurons to fire more rapidly, hence caffeine's stimulating effects.&lt;ref&gt;"The Side Effects of Caffeine / Nutrition / Healthy Eating." The Side Effects of Caffeine / Nutrition / Healthy Eating. N.p., n.d. Web. 07 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recovery supplements ===
Common supplements to help athletes recover from exercising include [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] and [[Essential amino acid|amino acid]] supplements. The main use for athletes to take dietary proteins are for hormones, oxygen transport, cellular repair, enzymes and conversion to fuel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Wilson, Lawrence, Dr. "THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTEIN." THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTEIN. N.p., Dec. 2015. Web. 05 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The intake of protein is a part of the nutrient requirements for the normal athlete and is an important component of exercise training. In addition, it aids in performance and recovery. Dietary protein intake for well-trained athletes should occur before, during and after physical activity as it is advantageous in gaining muscle mass and strength.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Bill, Richard B. Kreider, Tim Ziegenfuss, Paul La Bounty, Mike Roberts, Darren Burke, Jamie Landis, Hector Lopez, and Jose Antonio. "International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: protein and exercise." Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition 4 (2007). Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition. 26 Sept. 2007. BioMed Central Ltd. 25 Mar. 2009 &lt;http://www.jissn.com/content/4/1/8&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if too much protein and amino acid supplements is consumed it can be more harmful to the body than it is beneficial; health risks include: dehydration, gout, calcium loss, liver, renal damage, diarrhea, bloating, and water loss.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A bountiful protein diet must be paired with a healthy, well-rounded meal plan and regular resistance exercise. Characteristics of this particular diet include the type of exercise, intensity, duration and carbohydrate values of diet.&lt;ref name="LawrenceMarvin2"&gt;Lawrence, Marvin E., and Donald F. Kirby. "Nutrition and Sports Supplements Fact or Fiction." Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology 35 (2002): 299-306. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology. 2002. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. 25 Mar. 2009 &lt;journals.lww.com/jcge/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The most effective way to secure the natural nutrients required by the body for optimum health and physiological performance is by consuming vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, sugars and carbohydrates, which can be procured from fresh fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name="ApplegateElizabeth2"&gt;Applegate, Elizabeth A., and Louis E. Grivetti. "Search for the Competitive Edge: A History of Dietary Fads and Supplements." The Journal of Nutrition (1997): 869S-73S. The Journal of Nutrition. American Society for Nutritional Sciences. 1 Apr. 2009 &lt;jn.nutrition.org&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-exercise nutrition is an important factor in a nutrition plan for athletes as it pertains to the recovery of the body. Traditionally, sports drinks such as Gatorade and Powerade, are consumed during and after exercise because they effectively rehydrate the body by refueling the body with minerals and electrolytes. Electrolytes regulate the bodies nerve and muscle function, blood pH, blood pressure, and the rebuilding of damaged tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Nordqvist, Christian. "What Are Electrolytes? What Causes Electrolyte Imbalance?" Medical News Today. MediLexicon International, 24 May 2016. Web. 07 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; These types of drink are commonly made of glucose and sucrose in water and has been seen to improve the football players' performance.&lt;ref name="ApplegateElizabeth2"/&gt;

A substitute for sports drinks is milk, which contains many electrolytes, nutrients and other elements that help to make it an effective post-exercise beverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/457026-does-milk-contain-electrolytes/|title=Does Milk Contain Electrolytes?|last=Busch|first=Sandi|work=LIVESTRONG.COM|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is true that milk helps replace fluids and electrolytes lost after the athlete has worked out. A recovery drink is supposed to replenish the sugar lost, and help recover the muscles to be able to workout at full intensity by the next time they workout.  When compared to plain water or sports drinks, research suggests that chocolate milk is more effective at replacing fluids lost through sweat and maintaining normal body fluid levels. Athletes drinking chocolate milk following exercise-induced dehydration had fluid levels about 2 percent higher (on initial body mass) than those using other post-exercise recovery beverages. These results allowed for prolonged performance, especially in repeated bouts of exercise or training.&lt;ref&gt;Stager, Joel M., et al. "Chocolate Milk as a Post-Exercise Recovery Aid." International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism. 2006.&lt;http://www.winforum.org/chocolatemilkrecovery.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance-enhancing supplements ===
In the extreme case of performance-enhancing supplements, athletes, particularly bodybuilders may choose to use illegal substances such as [[anabolic steroids]]. These compounds which are related to the hormone testosterone, can quickly build mass and strength, but have many adverse effects such as high blood pressure and negative gender specific effects. [[Blood doping]], another illegal [[ergogenic]], was discovered in the 1940s when it was used by World War II pilots.&lt;ref name="ApplegateElizabeth2"/&gt; Blood doping also known as blood transfusions, increases oxygen delivery to exercising tissues and has been demonstrated to improve performance in endurance sports, such as long-distance cycling.&lt;ref name="Jenkinson, David M. 20082"&gt;Jenkinson, David M., DO, and Allison J.

The supplement, [[Creatine]], may be helpful for well-trained athletes to increase exercise performance and strength in relation with their dietary regimen.&lt;ref name="LawrenceMarvin2"/&gt; The substance [[glutamine]], found in whey fiber supplements, is the most abundant free amino acid found in the human body.&lt;ref name="GleesonMichael2"&gt;Gleeson, Michael.

The findings show that there are no substantial benefits from the extra intake of these supplements, yet higher health risks and costs.&lt;ref name="LawrenceMarvin2" /&gt;

==Factors influencing nutritional requirements==
Differing conditions and objectives suggest the need for athletes to ensure that their sports nutritional approach is appropriate for their situation. Factors that may affect an athlete's nutritional needs include type of activity (aerobic vs. anaerobic), gender, weight, height, body mass index, workout or activity stage (pre-workout, intro-workout, recovery), and time of day (e.g. some nutrients are utilized by the body more effectively during sleep than while awake).Most culprits that get in the way of performance are fatigue, injury and soreness. A proper diet will reduce these disturbances in performance. The key to a proper diet is to get a variety of food, and to consume all the macro-nutrients, vitamins, and minerals needed. According to Eblere's article (2008), it is ideal to choose raw foods, for example unprocessed foods such as oranges instead of orange juice. Eating foods that are natural means the athlete is getting the most nutritional value out of the food. When foods are processed, the nutritional value is normally reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal| author = Eberle, S. G| title = Endurance sports nutrition | magazine = Fitness Magazine | volume = 24| issue = 6| pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anaerobic exercise===
[[File:Weightlifting pictogram.svg|thumb|229x229px|Weightlifting is an anaerobic exercise]]
During [[anaerobic exercise]], the process of [[glycolysis]] breaks down the sugars from carbohydrates for energy without the use of oxygen. This type of exercise occurs in physical activity such as power sprints, strength resistances and quick explosive movement where the muscles are being used for power and speed, with short-time energy use. After this type of exercise, there is a need to refill [[glycogen]] storage sites in the body (the long simple sugar chains in the body that store energy), although they are not likely fully depleted.

To compensate for this glycogen reduction, athletes will often take in large amounts of carbohydrates, immediately following their exercise. Typically, high-glycemic-index carbohydrates are preferred for their ability to rapidly raise blood glucose levels.For the purpose of protein synthesis, protein or individual amino acids are ingested as well. Branched-chain amino acids are important since they are most responsible for the synthesis of protein. According to Lemon et al. (1995) female endurance runners have the hardest time getting enough protein in their diet. Endurance athletes in general need more protein in their diet than the sedentary person.Research has shown that endurance athletes are recommended to have 1.2 to 1.4 g of protein per kg of body weight in order to repair damaged tissue. If the athlete consumes too few calories for the body's needs, lean tissue will be broken down for energy and repair. Protein deficiency can cause many problems such as early and extreme fatigue, particularly long recovery, and poor wound healing. Complete proteins such as meat, eggs, and soy provide the athlete with all essential amino acids for synthesizing new tissues. However, vegetarian and vegan athletes frequently combine legumes with a whole grain to provide the body with a complete protein across the day's food intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jurek|first=Scott|title=Eat and Run|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular combination being rice and beans.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | author = Lemon P. | title = Do athletes need more dietary protein and amino acids? | journal = International journal of sports nutrition | volume = 5| pages = 39–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spada's research on endurance sports nutrition (2000) and where the types of carbohydrates come from will be explained. He advises for carbohydrates to be unprocessed and/or whole grains for optimal performance while training. These carbohydrates offer the most fuel, nutritional value, and satiety. Fruits and vegetables contribute important carbohydrate foundation for an athlete's diet. They provide vitamins and minerals that are lost through exercise and later needed to be replenished. Both fruits and vegetables improve healing, aid in recovery, and reduce risks of cancer, high blood pressure, and constipation. Vegetables offer a little more nutritional value than fruits for the amount of calories, therefore an athlete should strive to eat more vegetables than fruits. Dark-colored vegetables usually have more nutritional value than pale colored ones.(add info) A general rule is the darker the color the more nutrient dense it is. Like all foods, it is very important to have a variety. To get the most nutritional value out of fruits and vegetables it is important to eat them in their natural, unprocessed form with no other nutrient (sugar) added.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often in the continuation of this anaerobic exercise, the product from this metabolic mechanism builds up in what is called [[lactic acid fermentation]]. Lactate is produced more quickly than it is being removed and it serves to regenerate NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells on where it's needed. During intense exercise when oxygen is not being used, a high amount of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is produced and pH levels fall causing [[acidosis]] or more specifically [[lactic acidosis]]. Lactic acid build up can be treated by staying well-hydrated throughout and especially after the workout, having an efficient [[cool down]] routine and good post-workout stretching.&lt;ref name="Delamere, Nicholas 2009"&gt;Delamere, Nicholas, and Claudia Stanescu. "Muscle Energetics." Physiology 201. University of Arizona, Tucson. 25, 27, 29 Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intense activity can cause significant and permanent damage to bodily tissues. In order to repair, vitamin E and other antioxidants are needed to protect muscle damage. Oxidation damage and muscle tissue breakdown happens during endurance running so athletes need to eat foods high in protein in order to repair these muscle tissues. It is important for female endurance runners to consume proper nutrients in their diet that will repair, fuel, and minimize fatigue and injury. To keep a female runner's body performing at its best, the ten nutrients need to be included in their diets.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Taxation}}
A '''sugary drink tax''' or '''soda tax''' is a [[tax]] or [[fee|surcharge]] designed to reduce consumption of drinks with [[added sugar]]. Drinks covered under a soda tax often include [[Carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drinks]], [[sports drinks]] and [[energy drinks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Consumption of Sports Drinks by Kids and Adolescents|url=http://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/HER-Sports-Drinks-Research-Review-6-2012.pdf |website= Healthy Eating Research |accessdate= 18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax is a matter of public debate in many countries and [[beverage production|beverage producers]] like [[Coca-Cola]] often oppose it. Advocates such as national medical associations and the [[World Health Organization]] promote the tax as an example of [[Pigovian tax]]ation, aimed to discourage [[Healthy diet#Unhealthy diets|unhealthy diets]] and offset the growing [[Obesity#Economic impact|economic costs of obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Tavernise |first1=Sabrina |title= W.H.O. urges Tax on Sugary Drinks to Fight Obesity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/health/sugar-drink-tax-world-health-organization.html?_r=0 |accessdate=8 November 2016 |website= The New York Times |date= 11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Type II diabetes]] is a growing health concern in many developed and developing countries around the world, with 1.6 million deaths directly due to this disease in 2015 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Diabetes Fact Sheet |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/ |publisher=World Health Organisation |date= November 2016 |accessdate= 20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike sugar from food, the sugar from drinks enters the body so quickly that it can overload the pancreas and the liver, leading to [[diabetes]] and heart disease over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sugar-Sweetened Beverages |url= http://www.sugarscience.org/sugar-sweetened-beverages/ |work= SugarScience |publisher= University of California, San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study said that consuming one to two sugary drinks a day increases your risk of developing diabetes by 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Sugar-sweetened beverages and risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis|first1=Vasanti S. |last1=Malik |first2=Barry M. |last2=Popkin|first3=George A.|last3=Bray |first4=Jean-Pierre |last4= Després |first5=Walter C. |last5=Willett |first6=Frank B. |last6=Hu |date=1 November 2010 |publisher= |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=2477–2483  |doi=10.2337/dc10-1079 |pmid= 20693348 |pmc= 2963518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart disease is responsible for 31% of all global deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/en/ |title=Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)|website=World Health Organization|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although one sugary drink has minimal effects on the heart, consuming sugary drinks daily are associated with long term consequences. A study found that men, for every added serving per day of sugar-sweetened beverages, each serving was associated with a 19% increased risk of developing heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Koning|first=Lawrence|last2=Malik|first2=Vasanti S.|last3=Kellogg|first3=Mark D.|last4=Rimm|first4=Eric B.|last5=Willett|first5=Walter C.|last6=Hu|first6=Frank B.|date=2012-04-10|title=Sweetened beverage consumption, incident coronary heart disease, and biomarkers of risk in men|journal=Circulation|volume=125|issue=14|pages=1735–1741, S1|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.067017|issn=1524-4539 |pmc=3368965|pmid=22412070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study also found increased risks for heart disease in women who drank sugary drinks daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fung|first=Teresa T.|last2=Malik|first2=Vasanti |last3=Rexrode|first3=Kathryn M.|last4=Manson|first4=JoAnn E.|last5=Willett|first5=Walter C.|last6=Hu|first6=Frank B.|date=April 2009|title=Sweetened beverage consumption and risk of coronary heart disease in women|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=89|issue=4|pages=1037–1042|doi=10.3945/ajcn.2008.27140|issn=1938-3207|pmc=2667454|pmid=19211821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Obesity]] is also a global public and health policy concern, with the [[List of countries by Body Mass Index (BMI)|percentage of overweight and obese]] people in many developed and middle income countries rising rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obesity and overweight |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/|publisher=World Health Organisation|date=June 2016|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption of added sugar in sugar-[[sweetened beverages]] has been positively correlated with high calorie intake, and through it, with excess weight and obesity.&lt;ref name="AllenPrentice2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lindsay H Allen|author2=Andrew Prentice|title=Encyclopedia of Human Nutrition 3E|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OqcL6JgTUf8C&amp;pg=PA231|accessdate=4 April 2013|date=28 December 2012|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-384885-7|pages=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of one sugar-sweetened beverage per day to the normal US diet can amount to 15 pounds of weight gain over the course of 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malik|first=Vasanti S|last2=Schulze|first2=Matthias B|last3=Hu|first3=Frank B|date=August 2006|title=Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain: a systematic review|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=84|issue=2|pages=274–288|issn=0002-9165|pmc=3210834|pmid=16895873}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Added sugar is a common feature of many processed and convenience foods such as breakfast cereals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walton|first1=Alice|title=All Sugared Up: The Best And Worst Breakfast Cereals For Kids|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2014/05/15/all-sugared-up-the-best-and-worst-breakfast-cereals-for-kids/#71e461625836|publisher=Forbes|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; chocolate, ice cream, cookies, yogurts and drinks produced by retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harford|first1=Tim|title=The Budget’s sugar tax is half-baked|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/62bc4138-eb85-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc4a4.html#axzz433ffUgFN|website=Financial Times|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ubiquity of sugar-sweetened beverages and their appeal to younger consumers has made their consumption a subject of particular concern by public health professionals. In both the United States and the United Kingdom, sugar sweetened drinks are the top calorie source in teenager's diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nutrition Source: Sugary Drinks|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/sugary-drinks/#ref34|website=Harvard T.H.

Trends indicate that traditional soda consumption is declining in many developed economies, but growing rapidly in middle income economies such as Vietnam and India. In the United States, the single biggest market for carbonated soft drinks, consumers annual average per capita purchase of soda was 154 liters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silver|first1=Marc|title=Guess Which Country Has The Biggest Increase In Soda Drinking|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/19/415223346/guess-which-country-has-the-biggest-increase-in-soda-drinking|publisher=National Public Radio|date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denmark]] began taxing soft drinks and juices in the 1930s. More recently, [[Finland]] reintroduced an earlier soft drink tax in 2011, while [[Hungary]] taxes sugary drinks as part of its 2011 public health product tax, which covers all food products with unhealthy levels of sugar. [[France]] introduced a targeted sugar tax on soft drinks in 2012.&lt;ref name=ECSIP&gt;{{cite report |title=Food taxes and their impact on competitiveness in the agri-food sector |url=http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/5827/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/pdf |pages=27–30 |date=16 July 2014 |id=Ref. Ares (2014) 2365745 |author=ECSIP |publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a national level similar measures have also been announced in [[Mexico]] in 2013 and in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2016. In November 2014, [[Berkeley, California]] was the first city in the U.S. to pass a targeted tax on surgary drinks.

===Tobacco taxes===
Proponents of soda taxes cite the success of [[tobacco taxes]] worldwide when explaining why they think a soda tax will work to lower soda consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bittman|first1=Mark|title=Is Soda the New Tobacco?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/weekinreview/14bittman.html|website=The New York Times|date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the main concern with tobacco is cancer, the main concerns with soda are diabetes and obesity. The  tactics used to oppose soda taxes by soda companies mimic those of tobacco companies, including funding research that downplays the health risks of its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Soda the New Tobacco?|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/big-soda-is-fighting-science-on-sugar-2015-11|publisher=Business Insider|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics and economic theory of the tax ===
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] reports that a targeted tax on sugar in soda could generate $14.9 billion in the first year alone. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that three-cent-per-ounce tax would generate over $24 billion over four years.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, [http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/chicago_fed_letter/2011/cflmarch2011_284.pdf "Who would be affected by soda taxes?"] The Fed Letter, No. 284 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some tax measures call for using the revenue collected to pay for relevant health needs: improving diet, increasing physical activity, obesity prevention, nutrition education, advancing healthcare reform, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Soda Tax Weighed to Pay for Healthcare| url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124208505896608647|date=2009-05-12 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Janet | last=Adamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area to which the revenue raised by a soda tax might go, as suggested by Mike Rayner of the United Kingdom, is to subsidize healthier foods like fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext | title=Fat Taxes and the Financial Crisis | author=McColl, Karen | journal=[[The Lancet]] |date=March 2009 | volume=373 | issue=9666 | pages=797–798 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60463-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The imposition of a sugar tax means that sellers of sugary drinks would have to increase the price of their goods by an amount P2 from the original price X, and then take on the rest of the tax themselves (P1) in the form of lower profit per unit sold. The tax burden on consumers (P2) makes it more expensive for consumers to buy sugary drinks and hence a higher proportion of their incomes would have to be spent to buy the same amount of sugary drinks. This decreases the equilibrium quantity of sugary drinks that will be sold. Whether the sugary drinks tax is imposed on the seller or consumer, in both cases the tax burden is shared between both.&lt;ref name="website elasticity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thismatter.com/economics/tax-incidence.htm|title=Tax Incidence: How the Tax Burden is Shared Between Buyers and Sellers|first=William C.|last=Spaulding|website=thismatter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way that the tax burden is divided upon the consumer and seller depends on the price elasticity for sugary drinks. The tax burden will fall more on sellers when the price elasticity of demand is greater than the price elasticity of supply while on buyers when the price elasticity of supply is greater than the price elasticity of demand. The price elasticity for sugary drinks is different from country to country. For instance, the price elasticity of demand for sugary drinks was found to be -1.37 in Chile while -1.16 in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Guerrero-López, Carlos M. 2017"&gt;Guerrero-López, Carlos M., Mishel Unar-Munguía, and M. Arantxa Colchero. "Price Elasticity Of The Demand For Soft Drinks, Other Sugar-Sweetened Beverages And Energy Dense Food In Chile". BMC Public Health 17.1 (2017): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colchero, M.A. et al. "Price Elasticity Of The Demand For Sugar Sweetened Beverages And Soft Drinks In Mexico". Economics &amp; Human Biology 19 (2015): 129-137. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence if both of those results were realistic and the price elasticity of supply would be the same for both, the tax burden on consumers would be higher in Mexico than in Chile.&lt;ref name="website elasticity"/&gt;

===The reason for implementing a sugar tax in microeconomic terms===
The reasons for a sugar tax are the negative externalities of consuming sugar. As over-consumption of sugar causes health problems (external costs) such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and other diseases, and lost productivity, the third party impacted by this is the ‘public health system’ that will need to deal with those issues. More demand for health services leads to higher costs for health care and hence this increased stress on the public health system is a negative consumption externality of sugar consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Briggs | first1 = Adam | year = 2016 | title = Sugar Tax Could Sweeten A Market Failure | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 531 | issue = 7596| pages = 551–551 | doi=10.1038/531551a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brownell, Kelly D. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brownell | first1 = Kelly D. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = The Public Health And Economic Benefits Of Taxing Sugar-Sweetened Beverages | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 361 | issue = 16| pages = 1599–1605 | doi=10.1056/nejmhpr0905723| pmc = 3140416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics terms, the marginal social benefit (MSB) of sugar consumption is less than the marginal private benefit (MB). This can also be illustrated in the following equation. MSB = MB – Marginal External Cost (MXC). This is the case due to the fact that consumers think only of the benefit of sugar consumption to them (MB) and not the negative externalities to third parties (MXC) and so want to consume at the unregulated market equilibrium to maximize their utility. This means that there is overconsumption of sugar and a welfare loss is created.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saez|first1=Emmanuel|url=http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/course131/externalities1_ch05.pdf|title=Externalities: Problems and Solutions Chapter 5|publisher=UC Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sugary drinks tax, a Pigovian tax, is a way to correct the negative externality by regulating the consumption of sugary drinks.&lt;ref name="Guerrero-López, Carlos M. 2017"/&gt; Without a sugary drink tax, taxpayer money is used to pay for higher health care costs incurred from high consumption of sugar. Although this solution corrects the negative consumption externality, taxpayers that consume sugary drinks moderately and hence do not contribute to higher health care costs, still need to pay for this negative externality. Hence a sugary drinks tax may be a more appropriate solution as tax revenue that is collected from the sugar tax can be used to create childhood nutrition programs or obesity-prevention programs.&lt;ref name="Brownell, Kelly D. 2009"/&gt; This is a solution that could also correct the negative externality of sugar consumption as well as is a way to make the parties that cause the negative externality pay their fair share.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Countries ==
===Australia===
The [[Australian Beverages Council]] announced in June 2018 that the industry would cut sugar content by 10% by 2020, and by another 10%  by 2025. This was seen as an attempt to stave off a sugar tax. There were no plans to reduce the sugar content in the high sugar drinks. The plan is primarily to increase consumption of low-sugar or no-sugar drinks. sales of [[Coca-Cola Amatil]]'s fizzy drinks have fallen 8.1% by volume from 2016 to 2018.  The [[Australian Medical Association]] continued to press for a sugar tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Australian soft drink industry vows to slash use of sugar by 20 per cent |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australian-soft-drink-industry-vows-to-slash-use-of-sugar-by-20-per-cent-20180625-p4znkm.html |accessdate=7 September 2018 |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
A 2016 proposal for a 20% sugary drink tax, campaigned by Educar Consumidores, was turned down by the Colombian [[legislature]] despite popular support for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jacobs|first1=Andrew|last2=Richtel|first2=Matt|title=She Took On Colombia’s Soda Industry.

[[Denmark]] instituted a soft drink tax in the 1930s (it amounted to 1.64 Danish krone per liter), but announced in 2013 that they were going to abolish it along with an equally unpopular [[fat tax]], with the goal of creating jobs and helping the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/Denmark-to-scrap-decades-old-soft-drink-tax|title=Denmark to scrap decades-old soft drink tax|last1=Scott-Thomas|first1=Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed that the taxes were notably ineffective; to avoid the fat and sugar taxes, local retailers had complained that Danes simply went to Sweden and Germany, where prices were lower to buy butter, ice cream and soda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strom|first1=Stephanie|title='Fat Tax’ in Denmark Is Repealed After Criticism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/business/global/fat-tax-in-denmark-is-repealed-after-criticism.html|website=The New York Times|date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark repealed the fat tax in January 2013 and repealed the tax on soft drinks in 2014.

In September 2013, soda companies launched a media campaign to discourage the Mexican Chamber of Deputies and Senate from approving the 10% soda tax. They argued that such measure would not help reduce the obesity in Mexico and would leave hundreds of Mexicans working in the sugar cane industry jobless.&lt;ref name="Industriales y productores cañeros rechazan IVA a refrescos."&gt;{{cite news|last=Sánchez|first=Julián|title=Tycoons and Sugar Cane productors reject soda tax, (in Spanish).|url=http://www.redpolitica.mx/nacion/industriales-y-productores-caneros-rechazan-iva-refrescos|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=El Universal|date=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also publicly accused New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]&lt;ref name="Mexico's Soda companies fear junk-food tax"&gt;{{cite news|last=Partlow|first=Joshua|title=Mexico's Soda companies fear junk-food tax|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/mexicos-soda-companies-fear-junk-food-tax/2013/10/26/674f977c-3db3-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of orchestrating the controversial bill from overseas.

Research has shown that Mexico's sugary drinks tax reduced soft drink consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt; According to a 2016 study published in ''BMJ'', annual sales of sodas in Mexico declined 6% in 2014 after the introduction of the soda tax.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Monthly sales figures for December 2014 were down 12% on the previous two years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guthrie|first1=Amy|title=Mexican Soda Tax Helps Curb Consumption, Study Shows|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexican-soda-tax-helps-curb-consumption-study-shows-1452198709|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Households with the fewest resources had an average reduction in purchases of 9% in 2014, increasing to 17% by December.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, purchases of water and non-taxed beverages increased by about 4% on average.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whether the imposition of the tax and the resulting 6% decline in sales of soft drinks will have any measurable impact on long-term obesity or diabetes trends in Mexico has yet to be determined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The authors of the study urged the Mexican authorities to double the tax to further reduce consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2016 study published in ''[[PLoS Medicine]]'' suggested that a 10% excise tax on soda "could prevent 189,300 new cases of Type 2 diabetes, 20,400 strokes and heart attacks, and 18,900 deaths among adults 35 to 94 years old" over a ten-year period.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{Cite web|author1=Melissa Healy|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-soda-tax-mexico-20161102-story.html|title=Mexico's soda tax will save 18,900 lives and more than $983 million over 10 years, study says|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also included that "the reductions in diabetes alone could yield savings in projected healthcare costs of $983 million."&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;

A 2017 study in the ''[[Journal of Nutrition]]'' found a 6.3% reduction in soft drink consumption, with the greatest reductions "among lower-income households, residents living in urban areas, and households with children.

=== Norway ===
[[Norway]] has had a generalized sugar tax measure on refined sugar products since 1922, introduced to boost state income rather than reducing sugar consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tisdall|first1=Jonathan|title="Chocolate tax" should go|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1846927.ece|work=Aftenposten|date=26 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626022943/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1846927.ece|archivedate=26 June 2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Non-alcoholic beverages have since been separated from the general tax, and in 2017, the tax for sugary drinks was set to 3.34 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/okonomi-og-budsjett/skatter-og-avgifter/avgiftssatser-2017/id2514838/ |title=Avgiftssatser 2017 |language=Norwegian |publisher=Government of Norway |date=20 December 2016 |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the Norwegian government increased the sugar tax level by 83% for general sugar-containing ready-to-eat products, and 42% for beverages. The sugar tax per litre was bumped up to 4.75 kroner, and applies to beverages which are either naturally or artificially sweetened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/okonomi-og-budsjett/skatter-og-avgifter/avgiftssatser-2018/id2575160/|title=Avgiftssatser 2018|last=Finansdepartementet|date=2017-10-12|website=Regjeringen.no|language=no|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exempted from the sugar tax are all kinds of milk, whether powdered or in liquid form, ground and 3-in-1 coffee packs, and 100-percent natural fruit and vegetable juices, meal replacements and medically indicated drinks, as well as beverages sweetened with stevia or coco sugar.

===United Arab Emirates===
On October 2017, the [[United Arab Emirates]] introduced a 50% tax on soft drinks and a 100% tax on energy drinks, to curb unhealthy consumption of sugary drinks that can lead to diabetes; it also added a 100% tax on cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/uae-dubai-sugar-diabetes-tax-soda-energy-drinks-tobacco-2017-10 UAE imposes 'sin' tax on soda, tobacco, and energy drinks] Business Insider October 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax is imposed at the point of production or importation, in two bands. Drinks with total sugar content above 5g per 100 millilitres are taxed at 18p per litre and drinks above 8g per 100 millilitres at 24p per litre.

==== Criticism ====
The tax has been criticised on several grounds, including its likely efficacy and its narrow base.

From an opposing standpoint, Professor [[Robert Lustig]] of the [[University of California, San Francisco]] School of Medicine, has argued that the UK tax measure may not go far enough and that, "juice should be taxed the same way as soda because from a metabolic standpoint juice is the same as soda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaminska|first1=Izabella|title=Robert Lustig: godfather of the sugar tax|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/311a74ec-ed24-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc4a4.html?siteedition=intl|website=Financial Times|date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners have since called for the soft drinks tax to be extended to include confectionery and sweets to help tackle [[childhood obesity]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/12/sugar-tax-must-apply-to-sweets-as-well-as-drinks-say-campaigners  Sugar tax must apply to sweets as well as drinks, say campaigners] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Philadelphia, Pennsylvania =====
Democratic [[Philadelphia]] mayor [[Jim Kenney]] proposed a citywide soda tax that would raise the price of soda at three cents per ounce. At the time, it was the biggest soda tax proposal in the United States.

Taxing soda can lead to a reduction in overall consumption, according to a scientific study published in the ''[[Archives of Internal Medicine]]'' in March 2010. The study found that a 10 percent tax on soda led to a 7 percent reduction in calories from soft drinks. These researchers believe that an 18 percent tax on these foods could cut daily intake by 56 calories per person, resulting in a weight loss of 5 pounds (2&amp;nbsp;kg) per person per year.

A 2010 study published in the medical journal ''[[Health Affairs]]'' found that if taxes were about 18 cents on the dollar, they would make a significant difference in consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.2009.0061v1 Health Affairs, Soda Taxes, Soft Drink Consumption, And Children's Body Mass Index] 1 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press [https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iH4SZwbKI9PYhye5kJT_WLhm4B4AD9EQ1LN01 Study: Small Soda Taxes Don’t Dent Obesity] 1 April 2010, {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404132722/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iH4SZwbKI9PYhye5kJT_WLhm4B4AD9EQ1LN01 |date=4 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research from [[Duke University]] and the [[National University of Singapore]] released in December 2010 tested larger taxes and determined that a 20 percent and 40 percent taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages would largely not affect calorie intake because people switch to untaxed, but equally caloric, beverages. Kelly Brownell, a proponent of soda taxes, reacted by stating that “[t]he fact is that nobody has been able to see how people will really respond under these conditions.”&lt;ref&gt;Park, Alice (13 December 2010) [http://healthland.time.com/2010/12/13/study-sugar-tax-may-lead-to-only-modest-weight-loss "Study: Soda Taxes May Not Be Enough to Curb Obesity"] TIME.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2010 study concluded that while people would drink less soda as a result of a soda tax, they would also compensate for this reduction by switching to other high-calorie beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272710001222 | title=The effects of soft drink taxes on child and adolescent consumption and weight outcomes | author=Fletcher, Jason M. | journal=Journal of Public Economics |date=December 2010 | volume=94 | issue=11–12 | pages=967–974 | doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these arguments, the [[American Public Health Association]] released a statement in 2012 in which they argued that "Even if individuals switch to 100% juice or chocolate milk, this would be an improvement, as those beverages contribute some nutrients to the diet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/23/13/59/taxes-on-sugar-sweetened-beverages | title=Taxes on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: Policy Statement | publisher=APHA | date=30 October 2012 | accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study in the journal ''[[Preventive Medicine (journal)|Preventive Medicine]]'' concluded that "a modest tax on sugar-sweetened beverages could both raise significant revenues and improve public health by reducing obesity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andreyeva | first1 = T. | last2 = Chaloupka | first2 = F.

A 2012 study by [[Y. Claire Wang]], also in the journal ''Health Affairs'', estimates that a penny per ounce tax on sugared beverages could prevent 2.4 million cases of diabetes per year, 8,000 strokes, and 26,000 premature deaths over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Allison Aubrey, "Could a Soda Tax Prevent 2,600 Deaths Per Year?" NPR.org, 12 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, just before the city of Richmond began voting on a soda tax, a study was presented at a conference held by the [[American Public Health Association]] regarding the potential effects of such a tax in California. The study concluded that, given that soda's price elasticity is such that taxing it would reduce consumption by 10–20 percent, that this reduction "...is projected to reduce diabetes incidence by 2.9–5.6% and [[Coronary heart disease|CHD]] by 0.6–1.2%."&lt;ref&gt;[https://apha.confex.com/apha/140am/webprogram/Paper265089.html Health benefits, particularly in high risk populations, projected from an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages intake in California]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study in the ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'' concluded that a 0.5-cent-per-ounce tax on soft drinks would reduce consumption, but "increase sodium and fat intakes as a result of product substitution," in line with the Duke University study mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ajae.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/28/ajae.aat049.full | title=Predicting the Effects of Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxes on Food and Beverage Demand in a Large Demand System | author=Zhen, Chen | journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics |date=July 2013 | volume=95 | doi=10.1093/ajae/aat049 | pages=1–25| pmc=4022288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study published in the ''American Journal of Public Health'' concluded that Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) don’t have a negative impact on employment. Even though job losses in the taxed industry occurred, they were offset by new employment in other sectors of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M. Powell, Roy Wada, Joseph J. Persky, Frank J. Chaloupka, “Employment Impact of Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxes”, American Journal of Public Health 104, no. 4 (April 1, 2014): pp. 672-677.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 modelling study estimated that a 20% tax on SSBs would decrease the consumption of SSBs in Australia by 12.6%. The tax could decline the prevalence of obesity in the Australian population, which could lead to gains in health-adjusted life years. The results showed an increase of 7.6 days in full health for a 20-24-year-old male and a 3.7 day increase in longevity for their female peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veerman | first1 = JL | last2 = Sacks | first2 = G | last3 = Antonopoulos | first3 = N | last4 = Martin | first4 = J | year = 2016 | title = The Impact of a Tax on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages on Health and Health Care Costs: A Modelling Study | url = https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151460 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 4| page = e0151460 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0151460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proposals ====
There have been a number of proposed taxes on sugary beverages, including:

* In 1914, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] proposed a special revenue tax on soft drinks, beer and [[patent medicine]] after the outbreak of [[World War I]] caused a decline in imports and a corresponding decline in credit created by import [[tariff]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1914-09-01/ed-1/seq-1/ "Wilson Proposes Soft Drink Tax,"] Hawaiian Gazette. 1 September 1914. Page 1. Retrieved 1 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed taxation measure was not however linked to the anticipated health outcomes of reduced sugar sweetened beverage consumption. 
* In 1994, one of the first instances where the idea of a targeted tax on sugar sweetened drinks with a link to anticipated beneficial health outcomes, was proposed by [[Kelly D. Brownell]], Director of the [[Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale]]. 
* In a 2009 "Perspective" piece in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', Kelly D. Brownell, Director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale, and [[Thomas R. Frieden]], Director of the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], argue for taxing sugary beverages. The authors propose that sugary beverages may be the single largest cause of the obesity epidemic. They state that an excise tax of one cent per ounce would reduce consumption by more than 10%.&lt;ref name="hartocollis1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/03/nyregion/03sodatax.html | work=The New York Times | title=Soda Tax in N.Y. a Victim of Industry Campaign | first=Anemona | last=Hartocollis | date=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maryland and Virginia are two of 33 states that levy sales taxes on soda. Maryland taxes soda at a rate of 6%, while Virginia’s rate is 1.5%. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Virginia is also one of six states that impose a state excise tax on soda in addition to a sales tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.virginia.gov/content/miscellaneous-taxes|title=Miscellaneous Taxes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2009, the Obama Administration explored levying an excise tax on sweetened beverages as part of health care reform efforts, but the proposal was abandoned after heavy [[lobbying]] by the beverage industry.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Hamburger and Kim Geiger, [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/07/nation/la-na-soda-tax7-2010feb07 "Beverage Industry Douses Tax on Soft Drinks."] ''Los Angeles Times'', 7 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Public support ====
A 2016 poll by Morning Consult-Vox finds Americans split on their support of a soda tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://morningconsult.com/alert/poll-americans-split-soda-taxes/|title=Poll: Americans split on soda taxes |date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attitudes seem to have shifted a lot since 2013 when a poll concluded that "respondents were opposed to government taxes on sugary drinks and candy by a more than 2-to-1 margin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/04/25/most-americans-oppose-soda-candy-taxes|title=Most Americans Oppose Soda, Candy Taxes|work=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; In California, however, support for a tax has been high for a few years. According to a [[Field Poll]] conducted in 2012, "Nearly 3 out of 5 California voters would support a special fee on soft drinks to fight childhood obesity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Poll-shows-support-for-soda-tax-to-fight-obesity-3457423.php|title=Poll shows support for soda tax to fight obesity|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Support for a soda tax in New York was higher when pollsters say the money will go towards health care. A Quinnipiac University poll released in April 2010 found that New Yorkers opposed a state tax on soda of one penny per ounce by a 35-point margin, but opposition dropped to a margin of one point when respondents were told the money would go towards health care.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Bruce.

==== Lobbying ====
Fighting the creation of [[soft drink]] taxes, the [[American Beverage Association]], the largest U.S. trade organization for soft drink bottlers, has spent considerable money lobbying Congress. The Association's annual lobbying spending rose from about $391,000 to more than $690,000 from 2003 to 2008. And, in the 2010 election cycle, its lobbying grew to $8.67 million. These funds helped to pay for 25 lobbyists at seven different lobbying firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientlbs.php?lname=American+Beverage+Assn&amp;year=2009|title=Lobbying Spending Database-American Beverage Assn, 2009|publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An industry group called "Americans Against Food Taxes," backed by juice maker Welch's, soft drink maker PepsiCo Inc, the American Beverage Association, the Corn Refiners Association, McDonald's Corporation and Burger King Holdings Inc used national advertising and conducted lobbying to oppose these taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN16158491 Tax Soft Drinks To Fight Obesity, US experts say] Reuters, 16 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The group has characterized the soda tax as a regressive tax, which would unfairly burden the poor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nofoodtaxes.com/facts/#education "Education, Not Taxes] Americans Against Food Taxes, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against the sugary drinks tax====
* The criteria on what drinks are taxed may not include equally bad substitutes like fruit juice, energy-dense snacks and biscuits.&lt;ref name="Silano, Marco 2017"&gt;Silano, Marco, and Carlo Agostoni. "To Tax Or Not To Tax Sugary Drinks? This Is The Question". Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017): 1. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The tax is regressive since consumers on lower incomes will be more negatively impacted by higher prices than consumers on higher incomes.&lt;ref name="Silano, Marco 2017"/&gt; This regressive effect of the sugary drinks tax can be counteracted if the collected tax revenue is used to subsidize healthier foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brownell | first1 = Kelly D. | last2 = Frieden | first2 = Thomas R. | year = 2009 | title = Ounces Of Prevention — The Public Policy Case For Taxes On Sugared Beverages | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 360 | issue = 18| pages = 1805–1808 | doi=10.1056/nejmp0902392}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cross-border shopping can also be an easy way out for consumers to not pay the tax as they will buy sugary drinks from areas where they are not taxed.&lt;ref name="Silano, Marco 2017"/&gt;

===Various island nations and territories===
Island nations and territories have been successful in passing soda taxes. Just like with [[tobacco taxes]], smaller communities are often the first to pass a new type of tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520222861|title=Tobacco War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tairunnessa Memorial Medical College''' ('''TMMC''')&lt;ref&gt;http://tmmch.com/&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-bn|তাইরুন্নেসা মেমোরিয়াল মেডিকেল কলেজ}}) is a [[Private university|private]] [[medical school]] in [[Bangladesh]], established in 1995. It is an institution of the [[Tairunnessa Memorial Medical Centre]]. It was founded by [[M. Shamsul Hoque]], named after his mother, the late [[Tairunnessa]], a social reformer. There is a girls' school in her name in Balaganj as well.

It offers a five-year course of study leading to a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) degree. A one-year [[internship]] after [[graduation]] is compulsory for  all graduates. The degree is recognised by the [[Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council]].

M Shamsul Hoque was born in January 1943 in [[Hamidpur]] of [[Rajnagar Upazila]] in [[Moulovibazar]] which was then part of greater [[Sylhet]]. He helped the religious minorities to flee the country with a small ship he owned. As a result, he was wanted by the Pakistani army in 1971. He established a School named [[Tairunnessa Girls' High School]] in [[Balaganj]] in 1977.

Tairunnessa Memorial Medical Center started as a small [[outpatient]] department at [[Konya]], [[Gazipur District]] in 1995 which over the years has turned into a hospital and research center; TMMC Hospital, a 500-bed hospital complex, a 9 storied college building and an administrative block, a ladies' hostel. It is now one of the renowned Medical colleges in [[Dhaka]] with all departments.

Tairunnessa Memorial Medical College is listed in the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]],&lt;ref&gt;https://search.wdoms.org/home/SchoolDetail/F0002433&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and now maintained as the Avicenna Directory for Medicine and also listed in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED).&lt;ref&gt;https://imed.faimer.org/results.asp?country=160&amp;school=Tairunnessa+memorial+medical+college&amp;currpage=1&amp;cname=BANGLADESH&amp;city=Gazipur&amp;region=AS&amp;rname=Asia&amp;psize=25&lt;/ref&gt; 
IMED (International Medical Education Directory) recognition allow TMMC medical students/ graduates to apply for USMLE examination by ECFMG,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usmle.org/bulletin/eligibility/&lt;/ref&gt; USA for employment and for post-graduate training in the United States and Canada as well as can apply for PLAB,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/registration_applications/acceptable_primary_medical_qualification.asp&lt;/ref&gt; AMC&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalboard.gov.au/Registration/International-Medical-Graduates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and NZREX&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mcnz.org.nz/get-registered/how-to-register/acceptable-primary-medical-qualifications/&lt;/ref&gt; examinations etc. Also Graduates of TMMC are eligible for limited registration with the General Medical Council of United Kingdom.

A Nursing institute was formed in 2008, awarding a B.S.C nursing degree.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bnmc.gov.bd/Number_of_Institution_with_Seat_Capacity&lt;/ref&gt; This became a unit of Tairunnessa Memorial Medical College in 2013.

The TMMC has around 600 students, including students from Nepal and India. The hospital has expanded to 500-beds, and provides a 24-hour emergency service, with additional trauma center, EPI etc. 255 MBBS doctors have passed till 2014 December.

These rules apply to coal and metalliferous underground mines to provide for the establishment of rescue stations and conduct of rescue work.  In case of  explosion or fire, an inrush of water or influx of gases, services of specially trained men with special rescue apparatuses are required.

'''''Time to Change''''' is a mental health campaign in [[England]], launched in 2007 with the objective of reducing mental health-related stigma and discrimination.

==Description==
''Time to Change'' (TTC) was formed in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.time-to-change.org.uk/about-us/what-is-time-to-change Who we are], Time to Change. Retrieved 24 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; by mental health charities [[Mind (charity)|MIND]] and [[Rethink Mental Illness]], aiming to reduce mental health-related stigma and discrimination. A specific objective was to reduce stigma and discrimination by 5 per cent in the first 12 months. The first four years were funded by grants of £20.5 million from the [[Big Lottery Fund]] and [[Comic Relief]].&lt;ref name="PS one year outcomes" /&gt;

TTC also asks organisations and individuals to sign a pledge supporting its anti-stigma programme. Organisations signing the pledge include the [[Bank of England]], the [[Financial Conduct Authority]], [[British Gas]], [[British Telecom]], [[Lloyds Banking Group]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[E.ON]], [[PepsiCo]] and parts of the National Health Service.&lt;ref name="Huddersfield MP" /&gt; A pledge event took place at the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in October 2013, giving MPs an opportunity to sign up.&lt;ref name="Huddersfield MP" /&gt;

In 2011, TTC launched a four-week television advertising campaign to promote its new slogan: "It's time to talk. It's Time to Change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Rosie |title=Time to Change attempts to end mental health stigma |work=[[Marketing Week]] |date=22 March 2011 |url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/time-to-change-attempts-to-end-mental-health-stigma/3024681.article |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign has been fronted by a number of celebrities, including political strategist [[Alastair Campbell]], presenter [[Davina McCall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Campaign to get dads fighting mental health taboo |work=[[Cambridge News]] |date=18 August 2011 |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Health/Wellbeing-and-fitness/Campaign-to-get-Dads-fighting-mental-health-taboo.htm |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; singer [[Frankie Sandford]], and boxer [[Ricky Hatton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Rosie |title=Frankie Sandford fronts new mental health campaign |work=[[Hertfordshire Mercury]] |date=20 August 2013 |url=http://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/Health/Wellbeing-and-fitness/Frankie-Sandford-fronts-new-mental-health-campaign-20130820113137.htm |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the campaign supported the "Laughing for a Change" project run by actress [[Janice Connolly]], which aimed to promote awareness of mental health through a stand-up comedy tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Becca |last=Gill |url=http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2014/03/review-laughing-for-a-change-the-stand-newcastle/ |title=Review: Laughing for a Change – The Stand, Newcastle |work=Giggle Beats|date=1 March 2014 |accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
An academic study was carried out to measure whether TTC had met their 5 per cent target in the first 12 months. Though the participation in the telephone surveys was very low, they measured "progress toward meeting TTC's target of a 5 per cent reduction in discrimination".&lt;ref name="PS one year outcomes" /&gt;

An independent evaluation of the campaign's first four years took place in 2013. Though it found a reduction in discrimination from friends and families, change in attitudes from health professionals was negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Brindle |title = Mental health anti-stigma campaign fails to shift health professionals' attitudes |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=|date=3 April 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2013/apr/03/mental-health-anti-stigma-campaign |format=|doi=|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WIeża ciśnień PWiK 6.JPG|thumb|Tower on the water treatment plant]]

Three '''water towers in Września''' once supplied water in [[Września]], Poland. Two [[water tower]]s are still in use.

== Tower on the premises of the water treatment plant ==

The tallest was built in 1904 (some sources say 1907 and 1911) and is the highest building in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Gmina Września - Zabytki
 | url =http://wrzesnia.powiat.pl/turystyka/zabytki/gmina-wrzesnia.html
 | accessdate = 20 April 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower is {{convert|64|m}} tall and its top is finished with an interesting brass{{fact|reason=Brass is unheard of for roofing - [[copper]] is much more likely.|date=March 2018}} [[dome]]. The building belongs to the municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Enterprise. Next to the water tower stands the water treatment plant. The tower is near two ponds, allotment gardens and Polytechnic School.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Tower on the railroad station ==

Another tower, built in 1907 and now unused, is located at the [[Września railway station]], near several apartment buildings and an overpass. Another, smaller tower has been destroyed during the bombing on 5 October 1939.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Extinct tower in the barracks compound ==

A former tower was located in the prussian [[Barracks Complex in Września]]. It did not survive the Russian invasion. The location houses a cinema, a club and Wielkopolska Insurgents’ Trade School No 2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5872">'''Zygoma implants''' (or '''Zygomatic implants''') are different from conventional dental implants in that they anchor in to the zygomatic bone (cheek bone) rather than the maxilla (upper jaw).

Zygoma implants were first introduced in late 1990s by Dr. [[Per-Ingvar Brånemark|Per Ingvar Branemark]] widely acknowledged as the "Father of Dental Implantology". Zygomatic implants have been used for dental rehabilitation in patients with insufficient bone in the posterior upper jaw, due to, for example, [[Ageing|aging]], [[Neoplasm|tumor resection]], trauma, or atrophy. Zygoma implants take the anchorage from the Zygoma/ [[zygomatic bone]] (cheek bone).The Zygomatic bone is denser in quality and more cortical in nature than posterior maxillary bone .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kato|first1=Yorihisa|last2=Kizu|first2=Yasuhiro|last3=Tonogi|first3=Morio|title=Internal Structure of Zygomatic Bone Related to Zygomatic Fixture|journal=J Oral Maxillofac Surg|date=2005|volume=63|pages=1325–1329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the sturdy anchorage achievable in the dense bone of the zygomatic region, and the wide stress distribution achieved on these tilted implants, a prosthesis can often be immediately placed at the time of surgery .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maló|first1=Paulo|last2=Araujo Nobre|first2=Miguel de|last3=Lopes|first3=Isabel|title=A new approach to rehabilitate the severely atrophic maxilla using extramaxillary anchored implants in immediate function: A pilot study|journal=The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry|date=2008|volume=100|pages=354–356}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Zygoma implant is available in lengths ranging from 30 to 52.5&amp;nbsp;mm. The head of the zygoma implant is engineered to allow prosthesis attachment at a 45-degree angle to the long axis of the implant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kreissl|first1=Marion|last2=Heydecke|first2=Guido|last3=Metzger|first3=Marc C|last4=Schoen|first4=Ralf|title=Zygoma implant-supported prosthetic rehabilitation after partial maxillectomy using surgical navigation: A clinical report|journal=The journal of prosthetic dentistry|date=2007|volume=97|pages=121–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Zygomatic implants can be used in patients who do not have any teeth in the upper jaw, patients who have heavily broken down teeth or very mobile teeth due to diseases such as [[Periodontitis|generalised aggressive periodontitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajan|first1=Gunaseelan|last2=Baig|first2=Mirza Rustum|last3=Nesan|first3=John|last4=Subramanian|first4=Jayaram|title=Fixed rehabilitation of patient with aggressive periodontitis using zygoma implants|journal=Indian J Dent Res|date=2010|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The success rate of zygomatic implants reported in the literature world-wide is 97 - 98%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahnberg|first1=Karl-Erik|last2=Henry|first2=Patric J.|last3=Hirsch|first3=Jan-Mikael|last4=Öhrnell|first4=Lars-Olov|last5=Andreasson|first5=Lars|last6=Brånemark|first6=Per-Ingvar|title=Clinical Evaluation of the Zygoma Implant: 3-Year Follow-Up at 16 Clinics|journal=J Oral Maxillofac Surg|date=2007|volume=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complications associated with these implants are [[sinusitis]], [[paresthesia]] in the cheek region and oro-antral fistula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davó|first1=Rubén|last2=Malevez|first2=Chantal|last3=López-Orellana|first3=Cristóbal|last4=Pastor-Beviá|first4=Francisco|last5=Rojas|first5=Juliana|title=Sinus reactions to immediately loaded zygoma implants: a clinical and radiological study|journal=Eur J Oral Implantol|date=2008|volume=1|issue=1|pages=53–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
