The '''ARM Cortex-R''' is a family of [[32-bit]] [[reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor cores licensed by [[Arm Holdings]]. The cores are optimized for hard [[real-time computing|real-time]] and [[safety-critical system|safety-critical]] applications. Cores in this family implement the ARM Real-time (R) profile, which is one of three architecture profiles, the other two being the Application (A) profile implemented by the [[ARM Cortex-A|Cortex-A]] family and the Microcontroller (M) profile implemented by the [[ARM Cortex-M|Cortex-M]] family. The ARM Cortex-R family of microprocessors currently consists of ARM Cortex-R4(F), ARM Cortex-R5(F), ARM Cortex-R7(F), ARM Cortex-R8(F), and ARM Cortex-R52(F).

The ARM Cortex-R is a family of ARM cores implementing the R profile of the ARM architecture; that profile is designed for high performance hard real-time and safety critical applications. It is similar to the A profile for applications processing but adds features which make it more fault tolerant and suitable for use in hard real-time and safety critical applications.

Real time and safety critical features added include:

* Non overlapping memory regions
* [http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0338g/Chdhbjjb.html  Tightly coupled memory]
* Increased [[exception handling]] in hardware
* Hardware division instructions
* [[Memory protection]] unit (MPU)
* Deterministic interrupt handling as well as fast [[non-maskable interrupt]]s
* [[ECC memory|ECC]] on [[L1 cache]] and buses
* Dual-core [[Lockstep (computing)|lockstep]] for CPU fault tolerance

===ARM license===
[[ARM Holdings]] neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the core designs to interested parties. ARM offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. To all licensees, ARM provides an integratable hardware description of the ARM core, as well as complete software development toolset and the right to sell manufactured [[silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.

===Silicon customization===
Integrated device manufacturers (IDM) receive the ARM Processor [[Intellectual property|IP]] as [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] (written in [[Verilog]]). In this form, they have the ability to perform architectural level optimizations and extensions. This allows the manufacturer to achieve custom design goals, such as higher clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions, optimizations for size, debug support, etc.  To determine which components have been included in a particular ARM CPU chip, consult the manufacturer datasheet and related documentation.

==Applications==
The Cortex-R is suitable for use in computer-controlled systems where very low latency and/or a high level of safety is required. An example of a hard real-time, safety critical application would be a modern electronic braking system in an automobile. The system not only needs to be fast and responsive to a plethora of sensor data input, but is also responsible for human safety. A failure of such a system could lead to severe injury or loss of life.

Other examples of hard real-time and/or safety critical applications include:

* [[Medical device]]
* [[Programmable logic controller]] (PLC)
* [[Electronic control unit]]s (ECU) for a wide variety of applications
* [[Robotics]]
* [[Avionics]]
* [[Motion control]]

An '''airline service trolley''', also known as an '''airline catering trolley''', '''airline meal trolley''', or '''trolley cart''', is a small [[serving cart]] supplied by an air carrier for use by [[flight attendant]]s inside the aircraft for transport of beverages, [[airline meal]]s, and other items during a flight.

==History==
The airline service trolley system was introduced in the late 1960s at the same time as a new generation of large "widebody" aircraft were entering into service with the airlines. The significantly larger number of passengers on these aircraft meant that meals could no longer be efficiently delivered by hand, as they had been up until that time.

The growth of at-seat service on long distance rail has led to the adoption of similar service trollies for this purpose.

==Design==
The trolley is a rigid box form with [[Caster|castering wheels]] at each corner that can be braked to hold the trolley in position. Full and half size trollies are made. The front (both full and half size) and rear (full size only) have doors, and handles are provided at the top. There are currently several design families of trolley in use:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SAE ARP4171 - Safety Considerations of Food and Beverage Service Carts, |url=http://standards.sae.org/arp4171a/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SAE AS8056 - Minimum Design and Performance of Airplane Galley In-Flight Carts, Containers, and Associated Components |url=http://standards.sae.org/as8056/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*ACE - mainly used by [[British Airways]] which originated the specification, and produced by Driessen
*ATLAS - the most common size, used by approximately 80% of airlines. It was named for the initial group of carriers who originated the specification: [[Alitalia]], [[TAP Portugal|TAP]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Air France]], and [[Sabena]].
*KSSU - named for [[KLM]], [[Swissair]], [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS Scandinavian Airlines]], and [[Union de Transports Aériens|UTA]]; also used by [[Cathay Pacific]]

Individual carriers often customize an existing trolley family for their uses. Full size trolleys are generally about {{convert|0.3|m|ftin|frac=8}} wide, {{convert|1|m|ftin|frac=8}} tall, {{convert|0.75|m|ftin|frac=8}} long, and weigh about {{convert|25|kg|lb}} unladen. Lighter weight designs are also available.

'''Amobee'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amobee.com|title=Home - Amobee|website=amobee.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a marketing technology company whose  Brand Intelligence technology measures digital engagement. Their unified platform enables marketers to plan media campaigns.

Amobee is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Singtel]]. Amobee operates across North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia and Australia.

== History ==
Amobee was founded in May 2005 by Gil Shulman, Saul Rurka&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/person/saul-rurka "Saul Rurka"].crunchbase.com. Retrieved January 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and Zohar Levkovitz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/person/zohar-levkovitz "Zohar Levkovitz"]. crunchbase.com. Retrieved January 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It went live in June 2005. One year later, the company recruited Roger Cameron Wood, a mobile industry veteran, who established the company's U.S. presence in San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
 
In 2009, Amobee purchased media company RingRingMedia in order to expand their advertising customer base, enabling mobile media owners to sell advertising space to companies on a collective basis.&lt;ref name=ring_aq&gt;{{cite web|title=Amobee Acquires RingRing Media – Consolidates Mobile Advertising Market|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/marketing-advertising/13728644-1.html|publisher=[[AllBusiness.com]]|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of acquisition, RingRingMedia bought more than $2&amp;nbsp;million (£1.2&amp;nbsp;million) of mobile media a month, serving more than 4 billion ad impressions a month.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In July 2011, Trevor Healy, formerly of [[Jajah]] was appointed [[Chief executive officer]].&lt;ref name=healy_prn&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trevor-healy-named-ceo-of-amobee-125549428.html "Trevor Healy Named CEO of Amobee"]. prnewswire.com. July 14, 2011. Retrieved January 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Zohar Levkovitz will stay with Amobee as Vice Chairman.&lt;ref name=healy_prn/&gt;

Amobee was acquired by [[Singtel]] in March 2012 for $321 million.&lt;ref name="singtel 5-5-2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shelach |first=Shmulik |title=SingTel buys mobile ads co Amobee for $321m |url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000730587&amp;fid=1725 |accessdate=25 May 2012 |newspaper=Globes |date=5 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308112535/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000730587&amp;fid=1725 |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Amobee acquired two of its competitors: Adconion Direct for $235M and Kontera for $150M, in an attempt to consolidate its market position.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/10/amobee-buys-adconion-for-235m-and-kontera-for-150m-in-consolidation-play/ Amobee Buys Adconion For $235M And Kontera For $150M In Consolidation Play]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Arteris was founded in 2003 by Philippe Boucard and two other engineering executives who had worked together at T.Sqware, a [[startup company|startup]] that was acquired by Globespan.&lt;ref name=SW&gt;{{cite web|title=Arteris|url=http://www.semiwiki.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=Arteris:Arteris|work=SemiWiki.com|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ART&gt;{{cite web|title=Products|url=http://www.arteris.com/products|work=Arteris.com|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=COR&gt;{{cite web|title=Infos Legales Arteris|url=http://corporama.com/fr/societe/arteris/444681407|work=Corporama|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Company executives wished to address problems with existing monolithic bus and crossbar interconnect technologies, such as wire and [[routing]] [[Network congestion|congestion]], increased heat and power consumption, failed [[timing closure]], and increased [[Integrated circuit|die area]].&lt;ref name=FY /&gt;&lt;ref name=CB&gt;{{cite web|title=Arteris|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/arteris|work=CrunchBase|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ARM&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Profile: Arteris|url=http://www.arm.com/community/partners/display_company/rw/company/arteris/|work=ARM|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LI&gt;{{cite web|title=About Arteris|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/arteris|work=LinkedIn|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm’s leadership sought and received [[venture capital]] totaling $44.1 million for the creation of its new technology from [[investors]], including [[ARM Holdings]], Crescendo Ventures, DoCoMo Capital, [[Qualcomm]], [[Synopsys]], TVM Capital, and Ventech.&lt;ref name=CB /&gt;&lt;ref name=VB1&gt;{{cite web|last=Takahashi|first=Dean|title=Arteris raises $9.7M in fourth round for chip design tools|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/12/06/arteris-raises-9-7m-in-fourth-round-for-chip-design-tools/|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EE5&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon and Arteris Partner to Deliver Interconnect Models to SoC Designers|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/news/20120308-06/|work=Electronic Engineering Journal|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BB cream''' stands for '''blemish balm''', '''blemish base''', '''beblesh balm''', and in Western markets, '''beauty balm'''. 

Compared to a tinted cream, which would be just a cream with a very light tint, BB Cream is a foundation, moisturizer, and sunblock skincare product. 

The [[CC cream]] came later on and describes a Color Correction cream. A CC cream has all the benefits of a BB cream but with the specific feature of homogenizing the coloration of the skin, by correcting the complexion concerns such as redness or dullness.&lt;ref&gt;Latimer, Joanne. [http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/01/11/bb-cream-fans-lay-it-on-thick/ "BB cream fans lay it on thick"], ''Maclean's'', January 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
What became BB cream was originally formulated in the 1960s in Germany by dermatologist Dr. Christine Schrammek to protect her patients' skin after facial peels and surgery.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;Chang, Katie. [http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/vain-glorious-bb-creams-are-here/ "Vain Glorious | BB Creams Are Here!"],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conceitom.com.br/bb-cream-voce-sabe-para-que-serve/ BBcream.] Revisado.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulations==
[[File:Bb cream original from 1960s.jpg|thumb|120px|Christine Schrammek Blemish Balm from 1960s]]
BB creams come in a variety of different formulations.&lt;ref name=Chang/&gt; Because Korean companies focused initially on the Korean and East Asian markets, they are offered in a limited number of hues. Instead of offering multiple shades for different [[skin color]]s, most formulae are designed to oxidize to match the user's skin tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BB Cream Overview|url=http://www.bubzbeauty.com/reviews/110-bb-cream-overview.html|publisher=BubzBeauty}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skin-whitening properties of the cream as sold in the Asian market are an important element in its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Woo, Michelle. [http://www.ocweekly.com/2012-04-05/culture/trendzilla-bb-cream/ "Get Skin Like a Korean Soap Opera Star"], ''OC Weekly'', April 5, 2012.
*For skin whitening, see [http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/01/11/bb-cream-fans-lay-it-on-thick/ ''Maclean's'', January 11, 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;

The cream is promoted as a multi-tasker and all-in-one treatment, but Korean women mostly use it as an alternative to foundation, particularly those with Western formulations that tend to be too heavy for their tastes. The coverage is often mineral-based, and is intended to both cover and treat blemishes such as acne, sun spots, and age spots. It also has anti-wrinkle, anti-inflammatory, and soothing effects. Several contain [[hyaluronic acid]] and [[Vitamin C]]. 

==Markets==
BB creams make up 13 percent of the cosmetics market in South Korea. Some Korean brands also offer BB creams for men.&lt;ref&gt;For 13 percent of the South Korean market, see [http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/vain-glorious-bb-creams-are-here/ ''The New York Times'', March 29, 2012].

Western cosmetics companies began to launch BB creams in the Western market in 2012, though some of these creams have been criticized for lacking the skin-caring functions that BB creams normally have, and for being no more than tinted moisturizer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Early arrivals included [[Boscia]], [[Clinique]], [[Parfums Christian Dior|Dior]], [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]], [[Garnier]], [[Groupe Marcelle|Marcelle]], [[Maybelline]], [[Revlon]] and [[Estée Lauder Companies|Smashbox]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/01/11/bb-cream-fans-lay-it-on-thick/ ''Maclean's'', January 11, 2012].

==Cruelty-free and vegan BB creams==
BB creams advertised as [[cruelty-free]] include Smashbox (owned by [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]]) and [[The Body Shop]] (owned by [[L'Oreal]]).&lt;ref&gt;For Smashbox, see Reddick, Kelsey. [http://feminspire.com/finding-the-bb-cream-thats-right-for-you/ "Finding the BB cream that's right for you"], ''Feminspire'', July 14, 2012.

The Body Shop BB cream is certified by the Leaping Bunny Program, which means, according to the certification process, that no new animal testing has been used in any phase of product development by the company, its laboratories, or the suppliers of its ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leapingbunny.org/myths.php "Debunking Myths about Animal Testing"], The Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics, accessed September 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2013, [[Amore Pacific]], which has as its subsidiaries [[Etude House]] and [[Laneige]], has ended animal testing on all ingredients and cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130329060843/http://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/en/a/Cruelty-Free-International-welcomes-announcement-by-Amore-Pacific-Korean-cosmetics-company] (archived link, March 29, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Products certified as cruelty-free may still contain [[animal product]]s and may not be suitable for [[Veganism|vegan]]s. Vegan BB creams include the Superdrug own brand BB cream,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superdrug.com/superdrug/superdrug-bb-cream-5-in-1-day-cream-medium-50ml/invt/412558 "Superdrug BB Cream"], "Superdrug.com", June 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; BB cream souffles from Haut Cosmetics, 100% Pure Cosmetics, Multi-Mineral BB Cream from Pacifica,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pacificabeauty.com/alight-multi-mineral-bb-cream|title=Alight Multi-Mineral BB Cream|date=2016-11-06|newspaper=Pacifica|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Evenly Radiant BB Crème from Dermae.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hautminerals.com/veganbbcreamsouffle.html "Vegan BB cream souffles"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826202425/http://www.hautminerals.com/veganbbcreamsouffle.html |date=2012-08-26 }}, Haut Minerals, accessed September 7, 2012.

'''Chip select''' ('''CS''') or '''slave select''' ('''SS''') is the name of a control line in [[digital electronics]] used to select one (or a set) of [[integrated circuit]]s (commonly called "chips") out of several connected to the same [[computer bus]], usually utilizing the [[three-state logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kalinsky |first=David |title=Introduction to Serial Peripheral Interface |url=http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/beginner-s-corner/4023908/Introduction-to-Serial-Peripheral-Interface |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Ram2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. K. Venkata Ram|title=Advanced Microprocessor &amp; Microcontrollers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MUI1ioZrnzcC&amp;pg=PA94|year=2004|publisher=Firewall Media|isbn=978-81-7008-310-8|pages=94–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One bus that uses the chip/slave select is the [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] (SPI bus).&lt;ref name="Catsoulis2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Catsoulis|title=Designing Embedded Hardware|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9SbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT176|date=16 May 2005|publisher="O'Reilly Media, Inc."|isbn=978-0-596-00755-3|pages=176–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an engineer needs to connect several devices to the same set of input wires (e.g., a computer bus),  but retain the ability to send and receive data or commands to each device independently of the others on the bus, they can use a chip select. The chip select is a command pin on many integrated circuits which connects the [[I/O]] pins on the device to the internal circuitry of that device.&lt;ref name="Dandamudi2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sivarama P. Dandamudi|title=Guide to Assembly Language Programming in Linux|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wS4EG0GyKXUC&amp;pg=PA45|date=15 July 2005|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-25897-3|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the chip select pin is held in the inactive state, the chip or device is "deaf", and pays no heed to changes in the state of its other input pins; it holds its outputs in the [[high impedance]] state, so other chips can drive those signals. When the chip select pin is held in the active state, the chip or device assumes that any input changes it "hears" are meant for it, and responds as if it is the only chip on the bus. Because the other chips have their chip select pins in the inactive state, their outputs are high impedance, allowing the single selected chip to drive its outputs.&lt;ref name="Taylor2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=H.R.

[[File:Conversion marketing example.svg|thumb|Example]]
In [[electronic commerce]], '''conversion marketing''' is [[marketing]] with the intention of increasing ''conversions--''that is, site visitors who are paying [[customer]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dvir|first=Nim|last2=Gafni|first2=Ruti|date=2018|title=When Less Is More: Empirical Study of the Relation Between Consumer Behavior and Information Provision on Commercial Landing Pages|url=https://www.informingscience.org/Publications/4015|journal=Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline|language=en|volume=21|pages=019–039|doi=10.28945/4015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process of improving the conversion rate is called [[conversion rate optimization]]. However, different sites may consider a "conversion" to be a result other than a sale.&lt;ref name="Marketing Terms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conversion Rate|url=http://www.marketingterms.com/dictionary/conversion_rate/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Say a customer were to abandon an online shopping cart. The company could market a special offer, like free shipping, to convert the visitor into a paying customer. A company may also try to recover the customer through an online engagement method, such as proactive chat, to attempt to assist the customer through the purchase process.&lt;ref name=Webopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Conversion Marketing|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/conversion_marketing.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measures ==
The efficacy of conversion marketing is measured by the conversion rate: the number of customers who have completed a transaction divided by the total number of website visitors. Conversion rates for electronic storefronts are usually low.&lt;ref name="Conversion Marketing The Psychology of Converting Browsers into Buyers"&gt;{{cite web|last=Heathman|first=Bryan|title=Conversion Marketing: The Online Marketing Economy|url=http://conversionmarketingbook.com/ConversionMktgChapter-1.pdf|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion marketing can boost this number as well as online revenue and [[Web traffic|website traffic]].

Conversion marketing attempts to solve low online conversions through optimized [[customer service]], which requires a complex combination of personalized [[customer experience]] management, web analytics, and the use of customer feedback to contribute to process flow improvement and site design.&lt;ref name="Customer Intelligence"&gt;{{cite web|last=De Clerck|first=JP|title=Customer intelligence: why and how a data-driven business is a customer-centric business|url=http://www.conversionmarketingforum.com/en/blog/customer-intelligence-why-and-how-data-driven-business-customer-centric-business|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By focusing on improving site flow, online customer service channels, and online experience conversion marketing is commonly viewed as a long-term investment rather than a quick fix .&lt;ref name="Conversion Optimization Is The New SEO"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brinker|first=Scott|title=Conversion Optimization Is The New SEO|url=http://searchengineland.com/conversion-optimization-is-the-new-seo-32839|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased [[Web traffic|site traffic]] over the past 10 years has done little to increase overall conversion rates, so conversion marketing focuses not on driving additional traffic but converting existing traffic. It requires proactive engagement with consumers using real time [[analytics]] to determine if visitors are confused and show signs of abandoning the site; then developing the tools and messages to inform consumers about available products, and ultimately persuading them to convert online. Ideally, the customer would maintain a relationship post-sale through support or re-engagement campaigns. Conversion marketing affects all phases of the customer life-cycle, and several conversion marketing solutions are utilized to help ease the transition from one phase to the next.

==Conversion rate==
The conversion rate is the proportion of visitors to a website who take action to go beyond a casual content view or website visit, as a result of subtle or direct requests from marketers, advertisers, and content creators.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Conversion\ rate} = \frac{\mathrm{Number\ of\ Goal \ Achievements}}{\mathrm{Visitors}}&lt;/math&gt;

Successful conversions are defined differently by individual marketers, advertisers, and content creators. To online retailers, for example, a successful conversion may be defined as the sale of a product to a consumer whose interest in the item was initially sparked by clicking a banner advertisement. To content creators, a successful conversion may refer to a membership registration, newsletter subscription, software download, or other activity.

For websites that seek to generate offline responses, for example telephone calls or foot traffic to a store, measuring conversion rates can be difficult because a phone call or personal visit is not automatically traced to its source, such as the Yellow Pages, website, or referral. Possible solutions include asking each caller or shopper how they heard about the business and using a toll-free number on the website that forwards to the existing line.

For websites where the response occurs on the site itself, a [[conversion funnel]] can be set up in a site's analytics package to track user behavior.

== Common conversion marketing services ==
*'''Recommendations''' – [[Behaviorism|Behavioral analysis]] that identifies products and content relevant to the customer’s perceived intent.
*'''Targeted Offers''' – Targeting attempts to fit the right [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] with the right customer based upon behavioral and [[Demographics|demographic]] information.
*'''Ratings and Reviews''' – Using [[User-generated content|user-generated]] ratings and reviews to increase conversion rates, capture feedback, and engender visitor’s trust.
*'''Email Personalization''' – E-mail with embedded recommendations and [[Online chat|chat]] that are tailored personally to the recipient.
*'''Chat''' – As consumers tend to abandon sites after only three clicks, attempts to use proactive chat, reactive chat, exit chat, and click-to-call to convert consumers quickly.
*'''[[Click-to-call|Click-to-Call]]''' – Supports cross-channel conversion without losing the context of the conversation when visitors move from the website to the phone.
*'''[[Call to Action|Call to Action]]''' – Statement designed to get an immediate response from the person reading or hearing it. Broadly used in business as part of a digital strategy to get your users to respond through one single action.
*'''Co-Browsing''' – Tool for support agent infrastructure (chat or call) to assist customers in transacting online. 
*'''[[Voice of the customer|Voice of the Customer]]''' – Feedback about products, services, and online experiences that is captured through carefully analyzed [[Data model|structured and unstructured data]].
*'''Automated Guides''' – predetermined steps that allow a customer to better understand product features, and options to assist with the selection process.
*'''Re-Targeting''' – Identification of visitors interested in particular products or services based on previous site browsing or search to offer relevant content through targeted ad placement.'''

==Methods of increasing conversion rates in e-commerce==
Among many possible actions to increase the conversion rate, the most relevant may be:
* Employ ''Attention, Interest, Desire, Action'' [[AIDA (marketing)|(AIDA)]] principles to design the user experience through the [[conversion funnel]]
* Enhance the user's credibility and trust in the site, the product, and the business by displaying third-party trust logos and by quality site design 
* Improve site navigation structure so that users can browse and shop with minimal effort
* Improve and focus the website content, including text, photographs, illustrations, and video, towards target conversion &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Review, and edit or remove obsolete or distracting data
* Increase [[usability]] to reduce barriers to conversion
* Create a self-serving customer service format by letting the user reach informative answers quickly with a learning database.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* Offer active help (e.g. live chat, co-browsing)
* Generate user reviews of the product or service
* Gather a baseline user experience by recording user actions and compiling key objections {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* Enable clear tracking of standardized metrics using website analytics software for a predetermined conversion goal (e.g. "increase volume of newsletter subscriptions" or "decrease shopping cart abandonment percentage rate")
* Take repeated action to monitor and improve the site, based on quantitative and qualitative metrics

==Early life and childhood==
He was born on October 6, 1918 in [[Kenmare, North Dakota|Kenmare]], [[North Dakota]].

==Education==
He earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] in 1940 and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[New York University]] in 1944.

==Career==

Hansch worked on the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago and as a group leader at DuPont Nemours in Richland, Washington. In February 1946 he received an academic position at [[Pomona College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1975 Tolman Award Medalist, Dr. Corwin Hansch, Carnegie Professor of Chemistry, Pomona College|url=http://scalacs.org/?page_id=1462|website=Southern California Section of the American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansch taught [[Organic Chemistry]] for many years at Pomona College, and was known for giving complex lectures without using notes. His course in Physical Bio-Organic Medicinal Chemistry was ground-breaking at an undergraduate level.

Hansch may be best known as the father of the concept of [[quantitative structure-activity relationship]] (QSAR), the quantitative correlation of the physicochemical properties of molecules with their biological activities.

He is also noted for the [[Hansch equation]], which is used in 
*Multivariate Statistics - Multivariate statistics is  a set of statistical tools to analyse data (e.g., chemical and biological) matrices using regression and/or pattern recognition techniques.
*Hansch Analysis - Hansch analysis is the investigation of the quantitative relationship between the [[biological activity]] of a series of compounds and their physicochemical substituent or global parameters representing hydrophobic, electronic, steric and other effects using multiple regression correlation methodology.
*Hansch-Fujita &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; constant - The Hansch-Fujita &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; constant describes the contribution of a substituent to the lipophilicity of a compound.

Research Interests:
[[Organic Chemistry]]; Interaction of organic chemicals with living organisms, Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR).

*Fragment based regression analysis for [[quantitative structure-activity relationship]] (Hansch-analysis)

==Death==
He died of pneumonia on May 8, 2011 in [[Claremont, California|Claremont]], [[California]] at 92.&lt;ref name="LATIMES-OBIT" /&gt;

==Notes==
His research group at [[Pomona College]] worked on QSAR studies and in building and expanding the database of chemical and physical data as C-QSAR and Bioloom. His postgraduate associates were Rajni Garg, Cynthia D Selassie, Suresh Babu Mekapati, and Alka Kurup.

The Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design carried four obituaries (as found in a Pubmed personal subject [ps] search).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Yvonne C|title=Remembrances of Corwin Hansch|journal=J Comput Aided Mol Des|date=Jun 29, 2011|volume=25|issue=6|pages=519–523|doi=10.1007/s10822-011-9452-y|pmid=21713458|bibcode=2011JCAMD..25..519M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Yvonne C|last2=Stouch|first2=Terry|title=In tribute to Corwin Hansch, father of QSAR|journal=J Comput Aided Mol Des.|date=June 28, 2011|volume=25|issue=6|page=491|doi=10.1007/s10822-011-9449-6|pmid=21710390|bibcode=2011JCAMD..25..491M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fujita|first1=Toshio|title=In memoriam professor Corwin Hansch: birth pangs of QSAR before 1961|journal=J Comput Aided Mol Des|date=June 22, 2011|volume=25|issue=6|pages=509–517|doi=10.1007/s10822-011-9450-0|pmid=21695492|bibcode=2011JCAMD..25..509F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Selassie|first1=Cynthia Rachel|title=Obituary: Corwin H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2754">A '''Coulombmeter''' is a tool for measuring the [[electrostatic]] charge of a material.  
A Coulombmeter is used in combination with a [[Faraday cup]] or a metal probe 
for taking charge measures of a material.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

A '''Nanocoulombmeter''' is a Coulombmeter that is capable of measuring electrostatic charge down to 
the accuracy of  a fraction of a nanocoulomb (nC).

Electrostatic charge on an object can be measured by placing it into the Faraday 
Cup. The charge is transferred to the cup and displayed on the meter's display.  
The Faraday Cup of the Coulombmeter has an outer, grounded metal shield that 
surrounds an inner [[electrode]].  The inner electrode, which is electrically isolated 
from the shield, is connected to a meter to measure the charge.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

In the field of [[semiconductor]] design, a coulombmeter consists of a meter used in combination 
with a metal probe tip to pinpoint locations of excess charge on for instance a semiconductor 
device.  This application of a coulombmeter is useful because electrostatic discharge is a 
leading cause of failure in semiconductor chip designs, and may occur during the fabrication, 
inspection, assembly, and other processes.  A coulombmeter allow this electrostatic buildup to 
be easily measured simply by applying the instrument's probe to 
its lead

Note: coulombmeter is typically written as a single word in order to avoid confusion with the 
measurement unit 'coulombs-meter' and also to make it easily searchable in scientific literature.
 
==Detection of electron and ion beams==

A nanocoulombmeter, in combination with a [[Faraday cup]], can be used to detect and measure the beams emitted from [[electron gun]]s and [[ion gun]]s.

The Faraday cup consists of a shielded cup with an aperture, which collects the kinetically active electrons or ions, and an output wire, which is connected to an nanocoulombmeter.  The Faraday cup can be completely separate from the gun, or it can be part of an assembly mounted to the end of the electron/ion gun and manipulated remotely.  Some Faraday cup assemblies include a [[phosphor|phosphor screen]] as well.  An array of small Faraday cups or a Faraday cup on mounted on a linear manipulator can be used to measure the distribution of the beam current across the spot; this shows the beam uniformity.

[[File:Blue Crab Pot, Trap .jpg|thumb]]
'''Crab traps''' are used to bait, lure, and catch [[crab]]s for commercial or recreational use. [[Crabbing]] or crab fishing is the recreational [[hobby]] and commercial occupation of [[fishing]] for crabs. Different types of traps are used depending on the type of crab being fished for, geographic location, and personal preference.

== History in the United States ==
Crab has been a viable food source since [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s lived and fished on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]]. The [[Chesapeake Bay]], which is known for their Chesapeake Bay blue crabs (''[[Callinectes sapidus]]'') derives its name from "Chesepiook", a [[Susquehannock]] tribe word that means "Great Water".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David A. Farenthold |date=December 12, 2006 |title=A dead Indian language is brought back to life |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A1 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/11/AR2006121101474_2.html?nav=rss_email/components}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Susquehannock natives led European settlers to some of the best places to catch crabs. Even early treaties between European settlers and Native Americans included provisions for the rights of "[[Hunting]], Crabbing, [[Fowling]], and [[Fishing]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Maryland Blue Crab |publisher=skipjack.net |url=http://skipjack.net/le_shore/crab/history.htm |accessdate=November 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107005316/http://www.skipjack.net/le_shore/crab/history.htm |archivedate=November 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, generations of watermen made their living harvesting crabs and other resources along the Chesapeake Bay developing the most efficient method to catch crabs resulting in modern crab traps.
 
Since early European settlers in America, crabbing was an important food source to watermen of the Chesapeake and continues to be the source of income for many families. The [[Alaskan king crab]] fishing industry took off in the mid-1800s, and was one of the reasons Alaskans pushed so hard for statehood in 1959. Alaskans wanted to gain control of the area’s [[natural resource]]s, such as king crabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Crabbing |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/deadliestcatch/hsw-history-of-crabbing.html |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin F. Lewis invented the crab pot in the 1920s, patented it in 1928, and perfected it ten years later. The crab pot changed the way crabs are harvested on the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The crab pot is the most common method used to catch and harvest crabs worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Steven Zinski |title=Crabbing for hard shell crabs |publisher=bluecrab.info |url=http://www.bluecrab.info/crabbing/hardcrabs.html |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial crabbing is a very tough and dangerous job, so it is very important that commercial crab traps catch as many crabs as possible to be able to turn a profit. Commercial crabbing is heavily regulated by local state laws to ensure that the crabs are not [[Overfishing|over fished]] and that they are given enough time to breed and repopulate.&lt;ref name="CCT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial crab traps |publisher=Crab Traps |url=http://www.crabtraps.org/commercial-crab-traps |accessdate=November 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005929/http://www.crabtraps.org/commercial-crab-traps |archivedate=April 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike normal traps, commercial crab traps are large in size; some can easily be over 60" in diameter, allowing the trap to hold a larger amount of crabs than recreational crab traps. Commercial crab traps also contain a small [[stainless steel]] plate like a [[dog tag]], which identifies who the trap belongs to in case it is missed or swept by the current from its original location.&lt;ref name="CCT"/&gt;

After [[World War II]], Japanese crab vessels were competition for Alaskan king crab fishermen in the [[Bering Sea]]. Japanese crab vessels would crowd around cod boats, where king crabs devoured the fish waste. Ed Shields, a king crab fisherman was aboard a schooner at this time and recalls the Japanese encroaching on the [[Bristol Bay]] fishing area. Ed Shields says that his father sent a telegram to [[Seattle]], ordering one dozen high-powered rifles for each vessel and one case of ammunition each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Pots of Gold – Alaska King Crab Fishing History |publisher=[[YouTube]] |time=3:35 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lHCJ0qZjtg&amp;feature=player_embedded |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Shields states, "The coast guard didn’t care for this at all, the State Department didn’t care for it, but the news media did. It made good news. There’s no television at this time, but they did get in the national magazines like Time and Life. The adverse publicity to Japanese manufactured goods was so severe at that time from this campaign, the Japanese decided to pull out of Bristol Bay area and he sent a telegram saying, 'Bristol Bay is all clear now, Japanese gone home.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Pots of Gold – Alaska King Crab Fishing History |publisher=[[YouTube]] |time=3:35 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lHCJ0qZjtg&amp;feature=player_embedded |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The Derelict Crab Trap Program|Derelict Crab Trap Removal Program]] was created by the [[Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries|Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission]] in 2004. This was created to remove derelict crab traps from state-owned lakes and river-beds and to reduce the potential impact from these traps.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/fishing/derelict-crab-trap-removal|title=Derelict Crab Trap Removal {{!}} Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries|website=www.wlf.louisiana.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also similar programs in other states. They are similar to the program in Louisiana where the traps are removed during a 30-day period. There are programs all over the Gulf Coast, including areas like Texas and Florida. These programs have also been successful with the help of volunteers working together, and over 30,000 derelict traps have been removed in Texas alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/water/conservation/Crab_trap/Crab_trap.phtml|title=TPWD:|website=tpwd.texas.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types ==
'''The Maryland crab pot''' is an enclosed framework of wire with four openings. These openings are constructed so that when the crabs enter to eat the [[Bait (luring substance)|bait]], they cannot escape, and instead become immediately trapped. Once the crab becomes trapped and cannot leave the same way they entered, they float upward and go through the openings of the inner wire portion, which permanently traps the crab.&lt;ref name="Poppke"&gt;{{cite book |author=William Randolph Poppke |year=1977 |title=How to Catch a Crab |location=Briarcliff Manor, NY |publisher=Stein &amp; Day |pages=75–76, 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Maryland crab pot is a cube, generally two cubic feet and when baited and weighted, might weigh fifteen pounds or more. Sometimes it is left on the bottom for twelve to twenty-four hours or more. The end of the [[nylon]] rope is attached to a marked floating [[buoy]] so the location can be found and the pot retrieved.&lt;ref name="Poppke"/&gt; The Maryland crab pot is baited from the bottom with several [[oily fish]]. This is done by turning the pot on its side, stuffing the bait into the wire container, and closing the opening by securing the flap under the rubber tubing. The pot is then dropped into the water and when the crab fisher returns, pulls the pot up and into their boat.&lt;ref name="Poppke"/&gt;

[[File:Crab pot pulling, just north of Garibaldi, Oregon.webm|thumb|right|250|Pulling a crab pot, in the Pacific just north of [[Garibaldi, Oregon]]]]

'''West Coast crab pots''', which are primarily used for catching [[Dungeness crab]]s, vary slightly from the Maryland style crab pot. When the crabs enter either of the two funnel-type openings in search of bait, they are unable to exit through these funnel openings and become entrapped in the pot.&lt;ref name="Poppke"/&gt;

'''Ring crab traps''' are very popular along the [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] Coast. They are primarily used in river mouths and protected bays, but it is possible to use crab rings off the open shoreline. A crab ring is a simple piece of equipment that contains two wire rings that form the top and bottom of a collapsible basket. The lower ring is smaller than the upper ring and connected with a strong netting that forms the sides. Heavy [[chicken wire]], cotton webbing or other suitable materials are used for the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charlie White |year=1998 |title=How to Catch Crabs: a Pacific Coast Guide |edition=2nd |location=Surrey, British Columbia |publisher=Heritage House |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the bait is tied securely to the bottom of the basket, the lower basket sinks to the bay bottom where the sides collapse and the top and bottom rings lie together, leaving only a flat platform of tempting bait that the crab can easily reach. After the ring has been left on the bottom, the crabber raises the ring rapidly by pulling up with a rope, which prevents the crabs from escaping while the basket is pulled to the boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charlie White |year=1998 |title=How to Catch Crabs: a Pacific Coast Guide |edition=2nd |location=Surrey, British Columbia |publisher=Heritage House |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ring crab trap lays flat on the seafloor, there is nothing that prevents crabs from escaping before pulling it to the surface.
 
'''Pyramid crab traps''' are flat when lying on the bottom of the seafloor, but when raised to the surface, they form the shape of a [[pyramid]]. This trap is similar to the ring crab trap because there are no walls or cage that prevents the crabs from escaping before pulling it to the surface. The benefits of the pyramid crab trap over the ring crab trap is that the pyramid crab trap is slightly sturdier and can be used in waters with stronger currents.

'''Box crab traps''' are made from a strong non-collapsible [[wire]]. The main advantages of this crab trap are that once the crab enters searching for the bait it cannot escape, guaranteeing a catch when the crab enters. Along with this comes the added bonus of not having to regularly check the trap. The down side of this trap is storing and transporting it since it does not collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crab traps |publisher=Crap Traps |url=http://www.crabtraps.org/ |accessdate=November 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126113835/http://www.crabtraps.org/ |archivedate=November 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trot line crab fishing''' was used exclusively by commercial crabbers from 1870 to 1929, but this method has since been almost entirely replaced by the use of crab pots and crab traps. A trotline is a baited, hook-less, long line that is usually anchored on the bottom and attached to anchored buoys. This [[trotline]] is baited and after some time, the fisherman pulls the trotline up with crabs hopefully biting on the bait.&lt;ref name="Poppke"/&gt;

==Environmental effects==
A crab trap which becomes lost or abandoned (usually by accidental detachment of the float) becomes an ongoing environmental hazard. Crabs will continue to enter this [[ghost net|ghost trap]] to eat the bait, become trapped, and starve to death, attracting more crabs and other bottom-dwelling sea life; a single trap may kill dozens of crabs in this manner. For this reason, crab traps in many jurisdictions are required to have a "rot-out panel", a wooden panel the size of the largest entrance into the trap. This panel will disintegrate with a few weeks' exposure to seawater, opening the trap and allowing any crabs inside to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Florida Stone Crab Information |url=http://www.stonecrabflorida.com/how-to-catch-your-own-stone-crab.html |accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whales become entangled in crabbing gear. They get entangled in the vertical lines between crab traps on the ocean floor and the surface buoys. For example, as of 2014 there was an increasing number of entanglements off the coasts of the United States. Management measures have been implemented by NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Management Measures Implemented to Reduce Large Whale Entanglements in Commercial Trap/Pot and Gillnet Fishing Gear |url=http://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/stories/2014/25_new_whale_protection_measures.html |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cycling probe technology''' (CPT) is a [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] technique for detecting specific [[DNA]] sequences. CPT operates under [[isothermal]] conditions.  In some applications, CPT offers an alternative to [[PCR]]. However, unlike PCR, CPT does not generate multiple copies of the target DNA itself, and the amplification of the signal is linear, in contrast to the exponential amplification of the target DNA in PCR. CPT uses a sequence specific chimeric probe which hybridizes to a complementary target DNA sequence and becomes a substrate for [[RNase H]]. Cleavage occurs at the RNA internucleotide linkages and results in dissociation of the probe from the target, thereby making it available for the next probe molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatt R, Scott B, Whitney S, Bryan RN, Cloney L, Lebedev A | title = Detection of nucleic acids by cycling probe technology on magnetic particles: high sensitivity and ease of separation | journal = Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides | volume = 18 | issue = 6-7 | pages = 1297–9 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10474219 | doi = 10.1080/07328319908044696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microfluidic chip|Integrated electrokinetic systems]] have been developed for use in CPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang T, Badal MY, Ocvirk G, Lee WE, Bader DE, Bekkaoui F, Harrison DJ | title = Integrated microfluidic electrophoresis system for analysis of genetic materials using signal amplification methods | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 725–33 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11866051 | doi = 10.1021/ac010874j }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Probe ==
Cycling probe technology makes use of a chimeric [[Hybridization probe|nucleic acid probe]] to detect the presence of a particular [[DNA]] sequence. The chimeric probe consists of an [[RNA]] segment sandwiched between two DNA segments. The RNA segment contains 4 contiguous [[purine]] nucleotides. The probes should be less than 30 nucleotides in length and designed to minimize intra-probe and inter-probe interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beggs ML, Cave MD, Marlowe C, Cloney L, Duck P, Eisenach KD | title = Characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex direct repeat sequence for use in cycling probe reaction | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 34 | issue = 12 | pages = 2985–9 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8940435 | pmc = 229446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
Cycling probe technology utilizes a cyclic, isothermal process that begins with the [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] of the chimeric probe with the target DNA. Once hybridized, the probe becomes a suitable substrate for [[Ribonuclease H|RNase H]]. RNase H, an [[endonuclease]], cleaves the RNA portion of the probe, resulting in two chimeric fragments. The [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|melting temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of the newly cleaved fragments is lower than the melting temperature of original probe. Because the CPT reaction is isothermally kept just above the melting point of the original probe, the cleaved fragments dissociate from the target DNA. Once dissociated, the target DNA is free to hybridize with a new probe, beginning the cycle again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fong WK, Modrusan Z, McNevin JP, Marostenmaki J, Zin B, Bekkaoui F | title = Rapid solid-phase immunoassay for detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus using cycling probe technology | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 2525–9 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 10878037 | pmc = 86959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fragments have been cleaved and dissociated, they become detectable. A common strategy for detecting the fragments involves [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]]. With this method, a fluorescent marker is attached to the 5’ end of the probe and a [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quencher]] is attached to the 3’ end of the probe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buh Gasparic M, Cankar K, Zel J, Gruden K | title = Comparison of different real-time PCR chemistries and their suitability for detection and quantification of genetically modified organisms | journal = BMC Biotechnology | volume = 8 | pages = 26 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18325084 | pmc = 2322970 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6750-8-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When RNase H cleaves the probe, the quencher and fluorescent marker separate, increasing the intensity of the fluorescent marker. Cleaved fragments can alternatively be detected via amplification (e.g., [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]) or further modification to allow for other chemical means of detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolcott MJ | title = Advances in nucleic acid-based detection methods | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–86 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1423216 | pmc = 358255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with small concentrations of target DNA, the CPT protocol can be modified to increase specificity and efficiency. Increasing allotted time has been shown to improve probe cleavage efficiency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both increasing RNase H concentrations and use of a probe that isn’t prone to inter-probe and intra-probe interactions has been show to increase specificity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Advantages ==
Because cycling probe technology does not involve the amplification of target DNA, CPT has a lower risk of [[Polymerase chain reaction optimization|cross contamination]] than PCR.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, CPT is faster than PCR&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and doesn’t require a specialized [[Thermal cycler|thermocycler]]. CPT also does not require running CPT products on a [[Gel electrophoresis|gel]].

== Disadvantages ==
CPT requires specialized chimeric probes, making CPT assays more expensive than PCR.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because CPT probes are so specific, a new probe must be designed for each unique assay, further increasing cost. Clinical implementation is hampered financially, but it is also limited by the possibility of samples containing nonspecific [[RNAse|RNases]] other than RNase H.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Applications ==
CPT can be used to detect specific DNA sequences and by extension specific [[genotype]]s. For example CPT can be used to distinguish [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] produce from non-GMO produce.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Clinically, CPT can be used as an alternative to cell culturing in order to detect [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibacterial resistance]] of a pathogen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

CPT, at its core,  detects whether a specific sequence is present in a sample. But because cleaved probes accumulate following [[Rate equation|linear rate kinetics]], the amount of target DNA can be quantified. Consequently, CPT has been used to quantify the number of non-coding repeats in organisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CPT can be used in conjunction with other technologies, like [[molecular beacon]]s and [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|qPCR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacroux T, Rieck DC, Cui R, Ouyang Y, Dong WJ | title = Enzymatic amplification of DNA/RNA hybrid molecular beacon signaling in nucleic acid detection | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 432 | issue = 2 | pages = 106–14 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23000602 | pmc = 3522425 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2012.09.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Dashboard of Sustainability''''' is a free-of-charge, non-commercial software package configured to convey the complex relationships among economic, social, and environmental issues.
The software is designed to help developing countries achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and work towards [[sustainable development]]. The software package was developed by members of the Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators (CGSDI),&lt;ref&gt;Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators.  (2006)  ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/dashboard.asp Dashboard of Sustainability.]''; see also ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp CGSDI history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106123832/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp |date=2007-01-06 }}'' and ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp CGSDI members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224102435/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp |date=2007-02-24 }}'', all obtained Apr. 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been applied to quite a number of indicator sets, inter alia to the Millennium Development Goals indicators and the United Nations [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] indicators.

In 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability researchers Jochen Jesinghaus and Peter Hardi presented the Dashboard of Sustainability at the [[Earth Summit 2002|Johannesburg Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;IISD Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB) ''[http://www.iisd.ca/2002/wssd/enbots/aug30.html ENB on the side, Aug. 30, 2002]'' obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2002 [[World Social Forum]] in [[Porto Alegre]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranjit Devraj (TerraViva), ''[http://ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml Internet Dashboard Device for Navigating Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411090712/http://www.ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml |date=2007-04-11 }}'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was also included in the resources for the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] World Forum on Key Indicators.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2004), ''[http://www.oecd.org/document/2/0,2340,en_21571361_31834434_33637186_1_1_1_1,00.html European Union 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability]'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, the Millennium Project utilized the Dashboard of Sustainability to conclude in their [[State of the Future]] report that global prospects for improving the overall health, wealth, and sustainability of humanity are improving, but slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Jerome C.; Gordon, Theodore J.  (Jan. 1, 2006)  [[The Futurist (magazine)|The Futurist]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7246">'''Emission-aware programming''' is a [[design philosophy]] aiming to reduce the amount of [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitted by [[electronics|electronic devices]] through proper design of the [[software]] executed by the device, rather than changing the hardware.

==Emission sources==
Emission considerations require the evaluation of many details such as the clock frequencies and switching rates which are related to the oscillator. Rise/fall times and signal harmonics are related to the output driver. The data transfer rates can be dependent on hardware or can be controlled by software and often have to meet a certain protocol. Impedances, trace loading and the various circuit components are hardware related and must be considered from the beginning of the design.

Three basic actions for emission reduction can be defined:
*'''Avoidance of unnecessary RF-noise'''.
:Only this action can be applied to software based emission control. Reduction of for instance the switching frequency or the number of switching circuits reduces the power consumption and therefore the emissions. For example this could be low voltage operation or the usage of power reduction modes.

*'''Keeping RF-energy insulated from antenna structures'''.
:RF-energy is not a problem if the structures dealing with it are too small&lt;ref&gt;In RF-Engineering the unit of measurement is the wave length λ. Geometrical measures are taken as a multiple of the wave length. The geometrical distance ''d'' between two points are quantified in ''d''/λ. Thus terms like small or large are always related to wave length. Electromagnetically large structures accord to ''d'' &gt;= 1 and small to ''d'' &lt; 0.1 or ''d'' = λ/10. The range between electromagnetically small and large is the resonant frequency range.&lt;/ref&gt; for acting as effective antennas. A decoupling capacitor keeps most of the RF-energy locally in a small loop between the device and the capacitor as shown in the figure.
[[Image:Isulation of RF Energy.png|thumbnail|right|350px|Insulation of RF-Energy by Correct Placement of a Decoupling Capacitor.]]
*'''Transforming RF-energy into heat'''.
:Any impedance formed by coils, capacitors, resistors, ferrites etc. can be used for this purpose.
In the following all components that can be influenced by the software design will be described.

===The oscillator===
Microcontrollers require a clock source for the switching of the internal transistors. Almost all controllers require an external crystal or ceramic resonator. Since the ceramic resonator is potentially sensitive to spikes which can shorten clock periods typically a [[Pierce oscillator]] configuration is used. Harmonic frequencies of the clock cause unwanted emissions.&lt;br /&gt;
The circuit internal to the MC in simplified form is a NAND gate followed by an inverter.
The external oscillator is not the only source of emissions. The system clock circuits consists of an internal RF divider followed by large amplifiers. These amplifiers drive long lines inside the components and might cause interferences.&lt;br /&gt;
The use of internal oscillators instead of external ones should be preferred. (An additional hardware measure is the use of [[Spread spectrum#Spread-spectrum clock signal generation|spread spectrum oscillators]].)

===The power supply===
The field strength is proportional to the current as a consequence the power supply, providing the current for the entire system, is a strong source of emissions. Physically, a reduction of the power consumption of the system and the minimising of circuit loops (by the usage of decoupling capacities) emitting the noise, improves the EME performance.
A software based solution is to temporary disable peripheral devices when not needed and thereby reduce unnecessary power consumption.

===The I/O pins===
If an MC uses external memory space or peripheral devices continuous transitions on several data/address bus lines are implied. The emission depends on the frequency of the transitions, their quantity, rise/fall time and duration. The quantity of transitions, of port traffic can be influenced by the use of interrupts instead of continuous polling of ports. The use of interrupts is software based as well.&lt;br /&gt;
For the IRQ or reset pins (input pins) the termination is more important than for general I/O ports. If noise causes these two pins to mis-trigger it will have a negative effect on the circuit behavior. A high current consumption is often observed, particularly in CMOS devices, when the input pins are unconnected due to leakage current internal to the IC. Terminating high
impedance input pins can therefore lead to a reduction in supply current and hence reduces emission.
With most MC the internal pull-up resistors can be used to set unused pins to a defined voltage level.

===Ringing===
:To achieve fastest possible transmission rates the fastest possible switching rates are applied. The faster the switching rate the more likely over- and undershooting (ringing) will occur. Ringing of the output signal is mainly caused by parasitic elements of the output structure e.g. the capacitive components like the parasitic capacities and the load capacitances as well as the parasitic inductances that are built by the bond wire and the lead frame.
:In four techniques to reduce ringing are described:
:*Digital Control
:*Increasing the On-Resistance
:*Feedback Control
:*Skewing of the Output Driver Switching

===Ground bounce===
:Ground bounce is a voltage bounce caused by simultaneous switching of several outputs from one logic state to the other, for example from high to low. The voltage built up across the parasitic inductance of the IC ground return connection causes a transient voltage potential shift in the ground reference potential with respect to the system ground. Ground bounce is caused by CMOS crowbar current and the dynamic switching currents of capacitive loads.

==Rise and fall time==
One way of reducing the emissions of an MC System is to extend the rise and fall time (Slew Rate Control). Some controllers like the Motorola HCS08 offer the feature of software controlled slew rate output buffers enabling the user to extend the rise time from 3 ns to 30 ns for each pin separately.

Some microcontrollers offer [[current limiting]], a way of limiting the maximum current driven by the output port (e.g. Motorola MCS12).

==Emission control: power saving==
The most effective way of reducing emissions is to temporary shut down unused modules in the MC, thereby saving power. Most controller support several ''sleep modes''.

==Conclusion==
In order to reduce electromagnetic emissions on software basis the following measures should be considered:
:*Oscillator (kind and frequency)
:*Power (Saving Modes, low voltage operation and supply)
:*I/O Port switching frequency and power (if possible: Slew Rate control and skewing)

'''Most software implemented improvements on emission can only be detected using an Average-Detector!'''

==Life and work==
Dr Hüttenhain was the son of a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Conrector]] and studied after the high school diploma ({{lang-de|Abitur}}) 1924 in [[Siegen-Wittgenstein|Siegen]] at the [[University of Marburg]], the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Frankfurt]] and the [[University of Münster]]. He studied mathematics with [[Heinrich Behnke]] and astronomy at Münster. There he was assistant to Martin Lindow
(1880–1967), who was director of the observatory at Münster. In 1933, at the University of Münster, he took his examination for promotion of [[Doctor of Philosophy|Dr. phil.]] in astronomy under Lindow with the thesis titled: ''Spatial infinitesimal orbits around the libration points in the straight-line case of the (3 + 1) bodies''.&lt;ref&gt;Erschienen in Astronomische Nachrichten, Bd.&amp;nbsp;250, 1933, S.&amp;nbsp;298-316 {{DOI|10.1002/asna.19332501802}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, he was sent to the cipher bureau of the OKW [[Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht|OKW/Chi]] under Director Min.Rat. [[Wilhelm Fenner]]. Erich Hüttenhain had an interest in [[Maya civilization|Mayan chronology]] which led him to cryptology and thus to OKW/CHi. As a recruitment test, Fenner had sent him a message which had been enciphered with a private cipher. Hüttenhain duly deciphered it and was accepted as a possible cryptanalyst.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer Historical notes on computer science, Springer 2009 S.388, with photo&lt;/ref&gt; At OKW/Chi he was employed as a specialist to build a cryptanalytic research unit, and later he was most recently Executive Council Head of group IV Analytical [[cryptanalysis]].

During his time in OKW/Chi he succeeded, among other things, in the deciphering of the Japanese [[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple]] cipher machine ([[William F. Friedman|William Frederick Friedman]])&lt;ref&gt;Leiberich, Scientific American, June 1999 and plus there is to Leiberich in Germany but no documents&lt;/ref&gt; He and his staff &lt;ref&gt;"Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht#German Mathematicians Who Worked at OKW" Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia. Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. 8 July 2016. Web. 11 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; also temporarily succeeded in deciphering American [[Rotor machine|rotary machines]], such as the M 138 A and the [[M-209]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/18/18371/1.html |title=Als deutscher Code-Knacker im Zweiten Weltkrieg (As a German code breaker during World War II) |last=Schmeh  |first=Klaus |publisher=Telopolis |date=23 September 2004 |website=heise.de|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[North Africa]]. Later in the war, when the allies [[Allied invasion of Italy|invaded]] Italy, the allies learned in turn by deciphering Italian ciphers that their later systems, e.g. among others the [[SIGABA]] designed by Friedman, had not been broken and around that time, Hüttenhain had no more major successes.

After [[World War II]], being a high value target, he was taken by [[TICOM]] to the USA to be interrogated.&lt;ref name="Bamford2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Bamford|title=Body Of Secrets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2hnNp8G9wAC|date=4 September 2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-0920-9|page=17|quote=It is almost certain that no major cryptoanalytic successes were achieved without his knowledge.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Americans, he built a machine (which was already used by the Germans during World War II) that deciphered the Russian rotor machine encryption.&lt;ref&gt;Leiberich, loc.&lt;/ref&gt; He also created reports on the successes of the Germans on cryptographic territory during World War II (as deciphering the French naval codes, the Polish diplomat cipher or the security of the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] &lt;ref&gt;"Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht#Defensive cryptology" Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia. Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. 8 July 2016. Web. 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;). After his return he founded in 1947 the "Society of scientific work" within the [[Gehlen Organization]], which laid the foundation for the subsequent formation of the German Central Office for Encryption ({{lang-de|Zentralstelle für das Chiffrierwesen) (ZfCh)}}, a unit of the German Federal Intelligence Service ({{lang-de|Bundesnachrichtendienst}}).&lt;ref name="AidWiebes2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthew M.

One of the objectives of Hüttenhain was that in contrast to his experiences in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] where numerous independent cipher bureaux were spread throughout the Reich, all threads for evaluating cryptographic procedures were now to be integrated into a single office.

In 1926 he was a founding fellow of the Frankfurt [[Burschenschaft]] Arminia .&lt;ref&gt;H. de Rouet: 150 years of Frankfurt-Leipziger Burschenschaft Arminia, Frankfurt 2010, p 324&lt;/ref&gt;

Hüttenhain left a posthumous manuscript he wrote in about 1970 and in which he reports on his experience as a cryptologist.&lt;ref&gt;Monographs in the field of cryptology. A copy is in the [[Bavarian State Library]]. [[Friedrich L. Bauer|Friedrich Bauer]] referenced it in his book Historical notes on computer science, Springer 2009 S.&amp;nbsp;389ff&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3943">'''Explosion protection''' is used to protect all sorts of buildings and civil engineering infrastructure against internal and external [[explosion]]s or [[deflagration]]s. It was widely believed&lt;ref name=PhysicalSecurity&gt;{{cite book|title= Structural Design for Physical Security|author=Task Committee|year=1999|publisher=ASCE|isbn=0-7844-0457-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; until recently that a building subject to an explosive attack had a chance to remain standing only if it possessed some extraordinary resistive capacity.  This belief rested on the assumption that the specific impulse or the [[time integral]] of pressure, which is a dominant characteristic of the blast load, is fully beyond our control.

==Techniques of explosion protection==

===Avoidance===
''Avoidance'' will make it impossible for an explosion or deflagration to occur, for instance by means of suppressing the heat and the pressure needed for an explosion using aluminum mesh structure such as eXess, by means of consistent displacement of the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; necessary for an explosion or deflagration to take place, by means of [[padding]] gas (f. i. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or, by means of  keeping the concentration of flammable content of an atmosphere consistently below or above the [[explosive limit]], or, by means of consistent elimination of ignition sources.

===Constructional explosion protection===
Constructional '''explosion protection''' aims at pre-defined, limited or zero damage that results from applied protective techniques in combination with reinforcement of the equipment or structures that must be expected to become subject to internal explosion pressure and flying debris or external violent impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wtc.nist.gov Draft final reports on World Trade Center]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiperformancecoatings.com/solutions/blast-mitigation/ Blast mitigation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explosion protection method selection==

The technology of protection&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hendersonindustrial.com/explo_main.htm Explosion Protection Techniques]&lt;/ref&gt; can range in price dramatically but where the type of device is rational to use, would typically be from least to most expensive solutions: explosion doors and vents (dependent on quantities and common denominators, either may end up the wise price choice); inerting: explosion suppression; isolation – or combinations of same. To focus on the most cost effective, doors typically have lower release pressure capabilities; are not susceptible to [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] failures or subject to changing release pressures with changes in temperature, as “rupture membrane” type are; capable of leak tight service; service temperatures of up to 2,000°F; and can be more cost effective in small quantities. [[rupture (engineering)|Rupture]] membrane type vents can provide a leak tight seal more readily in most cases; have a relatively broad tolerance on their release pressure and are more readily incorporated into systems with discharge ducts.

There are several fundamental considerations in the review of a system handling potentially explosive dusts, gases or a mixture of the two. Dependent upon the design basis being used, often National Fire Protection Association Guideline 68, the definition of these may vary somewhat. To facilitate providing the reader with an appreciation of the issues rather than a design primer, the following have been limited to the major ones only.

In [[aviation]], a '''flight director''' (FD) is a [[flight instrument]] that is overlaid on the [[attitude indicator]] that shows the [[aviator|pilot]] of an [[aircraft]] the attitude required to follow a certain trajectory to which the flight is to be conducted.

==Description==
The flight director computes and displays the proper pitch and bank angles required for the aircraft to follow a selected flight path.

A simple example: The aircraft flies level on 045° heading at flight level FL150 at 260 kt indicated airspeed, the FD bars are thus centered. Then the flight director is set to heading 090° and a new flight level FL200. The aircraft must thus turn to the right and climb.
This is done by banking to the right while climbing. The roll bar will deflect to the right and the pitch bar will deflect upwards. The pilot will then pull back on the control column while banking to the right. Once the aircraft reaches the proper bank angle, the FD vertical bar will center and remain centered until it is time to roll back to wings level (when the heading approaches 090°).
When the aircraft approaches FL200 the FD horizontal bar will deflect downwards thus commanding the pilot to lower the nose in order to level off at FL200.

The FD is generally used in direct connection with the [[Autopilot]] (AP), where the FD commands the AP to put the aircraft in the attitude necessary to follow a trajectory. The FD/AP combination is typically used in [[Autoland|autopilot coupled low instrument]] approaches (below 200 feet [[Above ground level|AGL]]), or [[Instrument landing system#ILS categories|CAT II]] and [[Instrument landing system#ILS categories|CAT III]] [[Instrument landing system|ILS]] [[instrument approach]]es.

The exact form of the flight director's display varies with the instrument type, either [[crosshair]] or [[command bars]] (so-called "cue").

{{other uses|Geode (disambiguation)}}

'''GEODE''' is a [[trade association]] that represents independent energy distribution and distribution-related companies, as well as other organisations in [[natural gas]] and [[electricity]], privately or publicly owned, in Europe. It was founded in 1991 and represents 600 companies, both privately and publicly owned, in 10 countries.

GEODE took part in the Gas Regulatory Forum in Madrid in March 2012, and the Electricity Regulatory Forum in Florence in May 2012, both organized by the [[European Commission]]. GEODE defends the interests of local distributors before energy authorities on the national and international levels and allows the exchange of expertise, the share of data, and competence.

The study of the '''history of clothing and textiles''' traces the development, use, and availability of [[clothing]] and [[textiles]] over human history. Clothing and textiles reflect the materials and technologies available in different civilizations at different times. The variety and distribution of clothing and textiles within a society reveal [[social]] customs and [[culture]].

The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human characteristic and is a feature of most human societies, though it is not known exactly when various peoples began wearing clothes. anthropologists believe that animal skins and vegetation were adapted into coverings as protection from cold, heat and rain, especially as humans migrated to new climates.

Textiles can be [[felt]] or [[Spinning (textiles)|spun]] [[fibre|fibers]] made into [[yarn]] and subsequently [[net (textile)|netted]], looped, [[knitting|knit]] or [[weaving|woven]] to make fabrics, which appeared in the Middle East during the late [[stone age]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textileinstitutebooks.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TI&amp;Product_Code=1870372557CD-ROM&amp;Category_Code=History Creativity In The Textile Industries: A Story From Pre-History To The 21st century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509152332/http://www.textileinstitutebooks.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TI&amp;Product_Code=1870372557CD-ROM&amp;Category_Code=History |date=9 May 2008 }}. Textileinstitutebooks.com. Retrieved on 1 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; From the ancient times to the present day, methods of textile production have continually evolved, and the choices of textiles available have influenced how people carried their possessions, [[clothing|clothed]] themselves, and decorated their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Cambridge intro"&gt;Jenkins, pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources available for the study of clothing and textiles include material remains discovered via [[archaeology]]; representation of textiles and their manufacture in art; and documents concerning the manufacture, acquisition, use, and trade of fabrics, tools, and finished garments. Scholarship of textile history, especially its earlier stages, is part of [[material culture]] studies.

==Prehistoric development==
{{Human timeline}}
The development of textile and clothing manufacture in prehistory has been the subject of a number of scholarly studies since the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=barber1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=barber1995/&gt; These sources have helped to provide a coherent history of these prehistoric developments. Evidence suggests that humans may have begun wearing clothing as far back as 100,000 to 500,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="MB-2016"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis |first=Mary |title=The History of Clothing – How Did Specific Items of Clothing Develop? |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/clothing.htm |date=February 1, 2016 |work=[[About.com|The About Group]] |accessdate=August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early adoption of apparel===
Genetic analysis suggests that the human [[body louse]], which lives in clothing, may only have diverged from the [[head louse]] some 170,000 years ago, which supports evidence that humans began wearing clothing at around this time. These estimates predate the first known [[History of human migration#Pre-modern migrations|human exodus from Africa]], although other hominid species who may have worn clothes – and shared these louse infestations  – appear to have migrated earlier.

[[Sewing needles]] have been dated to at least 50,000 years ago ([[Denisova Cave]], Siberia) – and uniquely associated with a human species other than [[H. sapiens|modern humans]], i.e. [[homo denisovan|H. Denisova/H. Altai]]. The oldest possible example is 60,000 years ago, a needle point (missing stem and eye) found in [[Sibudu Cave]], South Africa. Other early examples of needles dating from 41,000-15,000 years ago are found in multiple locations, e.g. Slovenia, Russia, China, Spain and France.

The earliest dyed flax fibres have been found in a prehistoric cave in the Georgia and date back to 36,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090910142352.htm |title=Archaeologists Discover Oldest-known Fiber Materials Used By Early Humans |accessdate=31 December 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030416/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090910142352.htm |archivedate=1 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 25,000 year old [[Venus figurines|Venus Figurine]] "[[Venus of Lespugue]]", found in southern France in the Pyrenees, depicts a cloth or twisted fibre skirt. Other figurines from western Europe were adorned with basket hats or caps, belts worn at the waist, and a strap of cloth that wrapped around the body right above the breast. Eastern European figurines wore belts, hung low on the hips and sometimes string skirts.

Archaeologists have discovered artifacts from the same period that appear to have been used in the textile arts: (5000 BC) net gauges, spindle needles and weaving sticks.

==Ancient textiles and clothing==
The first actual textile, as opposed to skins sewn together, was probably [[felt]]. Surviving examples of [[Nålebinding]], another early textile method, date from 6500 BC.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Our knowledge of ancient textiles and clothing has expanded in the recent past thanks to modern technological developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/textiles.htm Forensic Photography Brings Color Back To Ancient Textiles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923030804/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/textiles.htm |date=23 September 2007 }}. Researchnews.osu.edu. Retrieved on 1 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Our knowledge of cultures varies greatly with the climatic conditions to which archeological deposits are exposed; the Middle East and the arid fringes of China have provided many very early samples in good condition, but the early development of textiles in the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and other moist parts of the world remains unclear. In northern [[Eurasia]], [[peat bog]]s can also preserve textiles very well.
The first known textile of South America was discovered in Guitarrero Cave in Peru, it was woven out of vegetable fibers and dates back to 8,000 B.C.E. 

From pre-history through the early Middle Ages, for most of Europe, the Near East and North Africa, two main types of loom dominate textile production. These are the [[warp-weighted loom]] and the two-beam loom. The length of the cloth beam determined the width of the cloth woven upon it, and could be as wide as 2–3 meters. The second loom type is the two-beam loom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48475172|title=The Cambridge history of western textiles|last=Jenkins|first=D.

===The textile trade in the ancient world===

{{Main|Silk Road}}

Throughout the Neolithic and Bronze ages, the fertile grounds of the [[Eurasian Steppe Route | Eurasian Steppe]] provided a venue for a network of nomadic communities to develop and interact. The Steppe Route has always connected regions of the Asian continent with trade and transmission of culture, including clothing.

Around 114 BC, the [[Han Dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;Elisseeff, Vadime, ''The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and Commerce'', UNESCO Publishing / Berghahn Books, 2001, {{ISBN|978-92-3-103652-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated the [[Silk Road]] Trade Route. Geographically, the Silk Road or Silk Route is an interconnected series of ancient trade routes between [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) in China, with [[Asia Minor]] and the Mediterranean extending over {{convert|8000|km|mi|abbr=on}} on land and sea. Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the great [[civilization]]s of China, Egypt, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]], the Indian subcontinent, and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and helped to lay the foundations for the modern world. The exchange of luxury textiles was predominant on the [[Silk Road]], which linked traders, merchants, [[pilgrim]]s, [[monk]]s, soldiers, [[nomad]]s and urban dwellers from China to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during various periods of time.

===Ancient Near East===
The earliest known woven textiles of the [[Near East]] may be fabrics used to wrap the dead, excavated at a [[Neolithic]] site at [[Çatalhöyük]] in [[Anatolia]], carbonized in a fire and [[radiocarbon]] dated to c. 6000 BC.&lt;ref name="Cambridge 1"&gt;Jenkins, pp. 39–47&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence exists of [[flax]] cultivation from c. 8000 BC in the Near East, but the breeding of sheep with a wooly [[Wool|fleece]] rather than hair occurs much later, c. 3000 BC.&lt;ref name="Cambridge 1" /&gt;

===Ancient India===
{{Main|History of clothing in India}}[[File:Mohenjo-daro Priesterkönig.jpeg|thumb|right|Statue of "Priest King", [[Mohenjo-daro]], [[Indus Valley Civilization]] ]]
We do not know what the people who constituted the Indus Valley Civilization, one of the earliest civilizations of the world, actually wore.  Any cloth that might have been worn has long since disintegrated and we have not yet been able to decipher the Indus script. However, historians and archaeologists have managed to piece together some bits of information from clues found in sculptures and figurines.

Terracotta figurines uncovered at Mehrgarh show a male figure wearing what is commonly interpreted to be a turban; female figurines depict women with elaborate headdress and intricate hairstyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=24966394|title=The Antecedents of Civilization in the Indus Valley|first1=Jean-François|last1=Jarrige|first2=Richard H.|last2=Meadow|date=8 May 1980|publisher=|journal=Scientific American|volume=243|issue=2|pages=122–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain cases, these headdresses have led historians to attach a religious connotation to the figurines and to the interpret the headdresses as symbols of a mother goddess.

One of the most important recovered figurines is that of the “Priest King” from the site of [[Mohenjo-daro]]. It is not only important because scholars have called it a representation of an assumed authority or head of state but also because of what it is wearing, however, it was recently discovered to be an interpretation of a wealthy trader. The calmly seated Priest-King is depicted wearing a shawl with floral patterns. So far, this is the only sculpture from the Indus Valley to show clothing in such explicit detail. However, it does not provide any concrete proof to legitimize the history of clothing in the Harappan times. Harappans may even have used natural colours to dye their fabric. Research shows that the cultivation of indigo plants (genus: '''''[[Indigofera]]''''') was prevalent.

Another important sculpture is of a dancing girl, also excavated from Mohenjo-daro. She is depicted with no clothing other than a number of bangles upon her arm. B. B. Lal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/8301806|title=How deep are the roots of Indian civilization? : archaeology answers in SearchWorks catalog|author=|date=|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508123647/https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/8301806|archivedate=8 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; has managed draw parallels between the dancing girl and women today in parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. He notices how contemporary women continue wearing those bangles even today. Harappans may not have left any evidence of what clothing or textiles they had at that time but they did leave remains of jewellery and beads in large amounts. For instance, the graves of Harappans have yielded various forms of jewellery such as neckpieces, bracelets, rings, and head ornaments. Multiple beads of varying shapes and sizes have also been recovered. This jewellery incorporates various materials such as gold, bronze, terracotta, faience, and shells; imported materials including turquoise and lapis lazuli were used too. This suggests that the Harappans might have engaged in long-distance trade. Long, slender carnelian beads were highly prized by the Harappans. Harappans were also experts in manufacturing microbeads, which have been found in various locations from hearths and graves. These beads were extremely hard to work with and needed extra precision to produce. A special drill has been found both at Lothal and Chanhudaro. Chanhudaro was a centre exclusively devoted to craft production.

===Ancient Egypt===
{{Main|Clothing in ancient Egypt}}

[[File:Woven silk, Western Han Dynasty.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Woven silk textile from the [[Mawangdui]] in [[Changsha]], Hunan province, China, 2nd century BC]]
Evidence exists for production of linen cloth in [[Ancient Egypt]] in the Neolithic period, c. 5500 BC. Cultivation of domesticated wild [[flax]], probably an import from the [[Levant]], is documented as early as c. 6000 BC. Other [[bast fiber]]s including [[Juncaceae|rush]], [[Reed (plant)|reed]], [[Palm tree|palm]], and [[papyrus]] were used alone or with linen to make rope and other textiles. Evidence for [[wool]] production in Egypt is scanty at this period.&lt;ref name="Cambridge 2"&gt;Jenkins, pp. 30–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinning techniques included the drop spindle, hand-to-hand spinning, and rolling on the thigh; yarn was also spliced.&lt;ref name="Cambridge 2" /&gt; A horizontal ground loom was used prior to the New Kingdom, when a vertical two-beam loom was introduced, probably from Asia.

Linen bandages were used in the [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|burial custom]] of [[mummy|mummification]], and [[Art of ancient Egypt|art]] depicts Egyptian men wearing linen [[kilt]]s and women in narrow dresses with various forms of shirts and jackets, often of [[Sheer fabric|sheer]] pleated fabric.&lt;ref name="Cambridge 2" /&gt;

===Ancient China===
{{Main|History of silk|Hanfu}}
The earliest evidence of silk production in China was found at the sites of [[Yangshao culture]] in Xia, [[Shanxi]], where a [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of [[bombyx mori]], the domesticated silkworm, cut in half by a sharp knife is dated to between 5000 and 3000 BC. Fragments of primitive looms are also seen from the sites of [[Hemudu culture]] in [[Yuyao|Yuyao, Zhejiang]], dated to about 4000 BC. Scraps of silk were found in a [[Liangzhu culture]] site at Qianshanyang in [[Huzhou|Huzhou, Zhejiang]], dating back to 2700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, Chi and Miao, Liangyun, [http://203.72.198.245/web/Content.asp?ID=27524&amp;Query=1 "Zhongguo Sichoushi" ("History of Silks in China")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123095921/http://203.72.198.245/web/Content.asp?ID=27524&amp;Query=1 |date=23 November 2007 }}.

Under the Shang Dynasty, [[Han Chinese]] clothing or [[Hanfu]] consisted of a ''yi'', a narrow-cuffed, knee-length tunic tied with a sash, and a narrow, ankle-length skirt, called ''shang'', worn with a ''bixi'', a length of fabric that reached the knees. Clothing of the elite was made of silk in vivid primary colours.

===Ancient Thailand===
The earliest evidence of spinning in Thailand can be found at the archaeological site of Tha Kae located in Central Thailand.  Tha Kae was inhabited during the end of the first millennium BC to the late first millennium AD.  Here, archaeologists discovered 90 fragments of spindle whorl dated from 3rd century BC to 3rd century AD. And the shape of these finds indicate the connections with south China and India.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, J. (2011). Iron and cloth across the Bay of Bengal: new data from Tha Kae, central Thailand. Antiquity, 85(328).&lt;/ref&gt; A spindle whorl is a disc or spherical object that fits onto the spindle to increase as well as maintain the speed of spinning.

===Ancient Japan===
The earliest evidence of weaving in Japan is associated with the [[Jōmon period]]. This culture is defined by pottery decorated with cord patterns. In a shell mound in the Miyagi Prefecture, dating back about 5,500, some cloth fragments were discovered made from bark fibers.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Jill, ''The story of the Kimono'', E. P. Dutton New Zork, 1989, {{ISBN|0-525-24574-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemp fibers were also discovered in the [[Torihama shell mound]], Fukui Prefecture, dating back to the Jōmon period, suggesting that these plants could also have been used for clothing. Some pottery pattern imprints depict also fine mat designs, proving their weaving techniques. The patterns on the Jōmon pottery show people wearing short upper garments, close-fitting trousers,  funnel-sleeves, and rope-like belts. The depictions also show clothing with patterns that are embroidered or painted arched designs, though it is not apparent whether this indicates what the clothes look like or whether that simply happens to be the style of representation used. The pottery also shows no distinction between male and female garments. This may have been true because during that time period clothing was more for decoration than social distinction, but it might also just be because of the representation on the pottery rather than how people actually dressed at the time. Since bone needles were also found, it is assumed that they wore dresses that were sewn together.&lt;ref&gt;Zamanaka, Norio, ''The Book of Kimono'', Kodansha International, 1986, {{ISBN|0-87011-785-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next was the Yayoi period, during which rice cultivation was developed. This led to a shift from hunter-gatherer communities to agrarian societies which had a large impact on clothing. According to Chinese literature from that time period, clothing more appropriate to agriculture began to be worn. For example, unsewn fabric wrapper around the body and poncho-type garments with head-holes cut into them. This same literature also indicates that pink or scarlet makeup was worn but also that mannerisms between people of all ages and genders were not very different. However, this is debatable as there were probably cultural prejudices in the Chinese document. There is a common Japanese belief that the Yayoi time period was quite utopian before Chinese influence began to promote the use of clothing to indicate age and gender.

From 300 to 550 AD was the Yamato period, and here much of the clothing style can be derived from the artifacts of the time. The tomb statues (haniwa) especially tell us that the clothing style changed from the ones according to the Chinese accounts from the previous age. The statues are usually wearing a two piece outfit that has an upper piece with a front opening and close-cut sleeves with loose trousers for men and a pleated skirt for women. Silk farming had been introduced by the Chinese by this time period but due to silk’s cost it would only be used by people of certain classes or ranks.

The following periods were the Asuka (550 to 646 AD) and Nara (646 to 794 AD) when Japan developed a more unified government and began to use Chinese laws and social rankings. These new laws required people to wear different styles and colors to indicate social status. Clothing became longer and wider in general and sewing methods were more advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Slade, T. (2009). Japanese fashion a cultural history (English ed.). Oxford: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Period of the Philippines===
[[File:Naturales 5.png|thumb|100px|The [[Boxer Codex]], showing the attire of a Classical period Filipino, made of [[silk]] and [[cotton]].]]
The classical Filipino clothing varied according to cost and current fashions and so indicated social standing. The basic garments were the Bahag  and the tube skirt—what the Maranao call malong—or a light blanket wrapped around instead. But more prestigious clothes, lihin-lihin, were added for public appearances and especially on formal occasions—[[blouse]]s and [[tunics]], loose smocks with s[[leeves]], capes, or ankle-length robes. The textiles of which they were made were similarly varied. In ascending order of value, they were [[abaca]], abaca decorated with colored [[cotton]] [[thread (yarn)|thread]], [[cotton]], cotton decorated with silk thread, silk, imported printstuff, and an elegant abaca woven of selected fibers almost as thin as [[silk]]. In addition, Pigafetta mentioned both G-strings and skirts of [[Bark (botany)|bark]] cloth.

Untailored clothes, however had no particular names. ''Pandong'', a lady's [[cloak]], simply meant any natural covering, like the growth on banana trunk’s or a natal caul. In [[Panay]], the word ''kurong'', meaning curly hair, was applied to any short skirt or blouse; and some better ones made of imported chintz or calico were simply called by the name of the cloth itself, tabas. So, too, the wraparound skirt the Tagalogs called tapis was hardly considered a skirt at all: Visayans just called it habul (woven stuff) or halong ([[abaca]]) or even hulun ([[sash]]).

The usual male headdress was the pudong, a turban, though in Panay both men and women also wore a head cloth or bandana called ''saplung''. Commoners wore pudong of rough abaca cloth wrapped around only a few turns so that it was more of a headband than a turban and was therefore called ''pudong-pudong—as'' the [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]s and [[diadem]]s on Christian images were later called. A red ''pudong'' was called magalong, and was the insignia of braves who had killed an enemy. The most prestigious kind of ''pudong'', limited to the most valiant, was, like their G-strings, made of pinayusan, a gauze-thin abaca of fibers selected for their whiteness, tie-dyed a deep scarlet in patterns as fine as embroidery, and burnished to a silky sheen. Such pudong were lengthened with each additional feat of valor: real heroes therefore let one end hang loose with affected carelessness.
Women generally wore a kerchief, called tubatub if it was pulled tight over the whole head; but they also had a broad-brimmed hat called sayap or tarindak, woven of sago-palm leaves. Some were evidently signs of rank: when Humabon’s queen went to hear mass during Magellan’s visit, she was preceded by three girls carrying one of her [[hat]]s. A [[headdress]] from Cebu with a deep crown, used by both sexes for travel on foot or by boat, was called ''sarok'', which actually meant to go for water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|title=Pinoy-Culture ~ A Filipino Cultural &amp; History Blog - Pre-Colonial Traditional Clothing (Note: Though...|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106060654/http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Greece===
{{Main|Clothing in the ancient world|Clothing in ancient Greece|Clothing in ancient Rome}}
[[File:ChitonAndHimation.png|thumb|200px|Greek chiton (left) and chiton worn under himation]]
Fabric in Ancient Greece was woven on a warp-weighted loom. The first extant image of weaving in western art is from a [http://metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/253348 terracotta lekythos] in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY]]. The vase, c. 550-530 B.C.E., depicts two women weaving at an upright loom. The warp threads, which run vertically to a bar at the top, are tied together with weights at the bottom, which hold them taut. The woman on the right runs the shuttle containing the weaving thread across the middle of the warp. The woman on the left uses a beater to consolidate the already-woven threads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48475172|title=The Cambridge history of western textiles|last=Jenkins|first=D.

Dress in [[classical antiquity]] favored wide, unsewn lengths of fabric, pinned and draped to the body in various ways.

[[Ancient Greek]] clothing consisted of lengths of wool or linen, generally rectangular and secured at the shoulders with ornamented pins called [[fibula]]e and belted with a sash. Typical garments were the [[peplos]], a loose robe worn by women; the [[chlamys]], a [[cloak]] worn by men; and the [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]], a tunic worn by both men and women. Men’s chitons hung to the knees, whereas women’s chitons fell to their ankles. A long cloak called a [[himation]] was worn over the peplos or chlamys.

The [[toga]] of ancient Rome was also an unsewn length of wool cloth, worn by male citizens draped around the body in various fashions, over a simple [[tunic]]. Early tunics were two simple rectangles joined at the shoulders and sides; later tunics had sewn [[sleeve]]s. Women wore the draped [[stola]] or an ankle-length tunic, with a [[shawl]]-like [[palla (garment)|palla]] as an outer garment. Wool was the preferred fabric, although linen, [[hemp]], and small amounts of expensive imported silk and cotton were also worn.

===Iron age Europe===
The [[Iron Age]] is broadly identified as stretching from the end of the [[Bronze Age]] around 1200 BC to 500 AD and the beginning of the [[Medieval]] period. Bodies and clothing have been found from this period, preserved by the anaerobic and acidic conditions of [[peat bogs]] in northwestern Europe. A Danish recreation of clothing found with such bodies indicates woven wool dresses, tunics and skirts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tollundman.dk/toej.asp The Tollund Man – Clothes and Fashion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118112211/http://www.tollundman.dk/toej.asp |date=18 January 2012 }}.

Garments were not always plain, but incorporated decoration with contrasting colours, particularly at the ends and edges of the garment. Men wore [[breeches]], possibly with lower legs wrapped for protection, although Boucher states that long trousers have also been found.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Warmth came from woollen shawls and capes of animal skin, probably worn with the fur facing inwards for added comfort. Caps were worn, also made from skins, and there was an emphasis on hair arrangements, from [[braids]] to elaborate [[Suebian knot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/bog/clothing2.html Archaeology Magazine – Bodies of the Bogs – Clothing and Hair Styles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514044700/http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/bog/clothing2.html |date=14 May 2011 }}.

==Medieval clothing and textiles==
The history of [[Medieval Europe]]an clothing and textiles has inspired a good deal of scholarly interest in the 21st century. Elisabeth Crowfoot, Frances Pritchard, and Kay Staniland authored ''Textiles and Clothing: Medieval Finds from Excavations in London, c.1150-c.1450'' (Boydell Press, 2001). The topic is also the subject of an annual series, ''Medieval Clothing and Textiles'' (Boydell Press), edited by Robin Netherton and [[Gale Owen-Crocker|Gale R. Owen-Crocker]], Emeritus Professor of Anglo-Saxon Culture at the [[University of Manchester]].

===Byzantium===
{{Main|Byzantine dress|Byzantine silk}}
The [[Byzantine empire|Byzantines]] made and exported very richly patterned cloth, woven and embroidered for the upper classes, and [[Resist dyeing|resist-dyed]] and [[woodblock printing|printed]] for the lower.&lt;ref&gt;Payne et al. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; By Justinian's time the Roman toga had been replaced by the [[tunic]]a, or long ''[[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]'', for both sexes, over which the upper classes wore various other garments, like a ''dalmatica'' ([[dalmatic]]), a heavier and shorter type of tunica; short and long [[cloak]]s were fastened on the right shoulder.

Leggings and hose were often worn, but are not prominent in depictions of the wealthy; they were associated with barbarians, whether European or Persian.&lt;ref&gt;Payne et al. (1992) p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early medieval Europe===

{{Main|Early medieval European dress|Anglo-Saxon dress|English Medieval fashion}}
European dress changed gradually in the years 400 to 1100. People in many countries dressed differently depending on whether they identified with the old Romanised population, or the new [[migration period|invading populations]] such as [[Franks]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], and [[Visigoths]]. Men of the invading peoples generally wore short [[tunic]]s, with belts, and visible trousers, [[Hose (clothing)|hose]] or leggings. The Romanised populations, and the Church, remained faithful to the longer tunics of Roman formal costume.&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier &amp; Mane, pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

The elite imported silk cloth from the Byzantine, and later Muslim, worlds, and also probably cotton. They also could afford bleached linen and dyed and simply patterned wool woven in Europe itself. But embroidered decoration was probably very widespread, though not usually detectable in art. Lower classes wore local or homespun wool, often undyed, trimmed with bands of decoration, variously [[embroidery]], [[tablet weaving|tablet-woven]] bands, or colorful borders woven into the fabric in the loom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gale Owen-Crocker|Owen-Crocker, Gale R.]], ''Dress in Anglo-Saxon England'', revised edition, Boydell Press, 2004, {{ISBN|1-84383-081-7}} pp. 309–315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norse"&gt;Østergård, Else, ''Woven into the Earth: Textiles from Norse Greenland'', Aarhus University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|87-7288-935-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High middle ages and the rise of fashion===
{{Main|1100–1200 in fashion|1200–1300 in fashion|1300–1400 in fashion}}
[[File:ItalianSilkDamask.jpg|left|150px|thumb|14th-century Italian silk damasks]]
Clothing in 12th and 13th century Europe remained very simple for both men and women, and quite uniform across the subcontinent. The traditional combination of short tunic with hose for working-class men and long tunic with overgown for women and upper class men remained the norm. Most clothing, especially outside the wealthier classes, remained little changed from three or four centuries earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier &amp; Mane, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13th century saw great progress in the dyeing and working of wool, which was by far the most important material for outerwear. Linen was increasingly used for clothing that was directly in contact with the skin. Unlike wool, linen could be laundered and bleached in the sun. Cotton, imported raw from Egypt and elsewhere, was used for padding and quilting, and cloths such as [[buckram]] and [[fustian]].

[[Crusades|Crusaders]] returning from the [[Levant]] brought knowledge of its fine textiles, including light silks, to Western Europe. In Northern Europe, silk was an imported and very expensive luxury.&lt;ref&gt;Donald King in Jonathan Alexander &amp; Paul Binski (eds), ''Age of Chivalry, Art in Plantagenet England, 1200–1400'', p. 157, Royal Academy/Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London 1987 {{ISBN|0-297-79182-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The well-off could afford woven [[brocade]]s from Italy or even further afield. Fashionable Italian silks of this period featured repeating patterns of roundels and animals, deriving from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] silk-weaving centres in [[Bursa]], and ultimately from [[Yuan Dynasty]] China via the Silk Road.&lt;ref name="Koslin"/&gt;

Cultural and costume historians agree that the mid-14th century marks the emergence of recognizable "fashion" in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Laver, James: ''The Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', Abrams, 1979, p. 62 {{ISBN|0-684-13522-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; From this century onwards, Western fashion changed at a pace quite unknown to other civilizations, whether ancient or contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;"The birth of fashion", in Boucher, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; In most other cultures, only major political changes, such as the Muslim conquest of India, produced radical changes in clothing, and in China, Japan, and the [[Ottoman Empire]] fashion changed only slightly over periods of several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, pp. 312, 313, 323&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period, the draped garments and straight seams of previous centuries were replaced by curved seams and the beginnings of tailoring, which allowed clothing to more closely fit the human form, as did the use of lacing and [[Button (clothing)|button]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Singman, Jeffrey L. and Will McLean: ''Daily Life in Chaucer's England'', p. 93. Greenwood Press, London, 2005 {{ISBN|0-313-29375-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fashion for ''mi-parti'' or ''parti-coloured'' garments made of two contrasting fabrics, one on each side, arose for men in mid-century,&lt;ref&gt;Black, J. Anderson, and Madge Garland: ''A History of Fashion'', Morrow, 1975, {{ISBN|0-688-02893-4}}, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; and was especially popular at the English court. Sometimes just the hose would have different colours on each leg.

===Renaissance Europe===
[[File:Edward IV Plantagenet.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Bold floral patterned silks, 15th century.]]
{{Main|1400–1500 in fashion}}
Wool remained the most popular fabric for all classes, followed by linen and hemp.&lt;ref name="Koslin"&gt;Koslin, Désirée, "Value-Added Stuffs and Shifts in Meaning: An Overview and Case-Study of Medieval Textile Paradigms", in Koslin and Snyder, ''Encountering Medieval Textiles and Dress'', pp. 237–240 {{ISBN|0-312-29377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wool fabrics were available in a wide range of qualities, from rough undyed cloth to fine, dense [[broadcloth]] with a velvety nap; high-value broadcloth was a backbone of the English economy and was exported throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Crowfoot"&gt;Crowfoot, Elizabeth, Frances Prichard and Kay Staniland, ''Textiles and Clothing c. 1150 -c. 1450'', Museum of London, 1992, {{ISBN|0-11-290445-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wool fabrics were dyed in rich colours, notably reds, greens, golds, and blues.&lt;ref name="Koslin" /&gt;

Silk-weaving was well established around the Mediterranean by the beginning of the 15th century, and figured silks, often silk [[velvet]]s with silver-gilt [[weft]]s, are increasingly seen in Italian dress and in the dress of the wealthy throughout Europe. Stately floral designs featuring a [[pomegranate]] or [[artichoke]] motif had reached Europe from China in the previous century and became a dominant design in the Ottoman silk-producing cities of [[Istanbul]] and [[Bursa]], and spread to silk weavers in [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], Venice, [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and [[Seville]] in this period.&lt;ref name="Koslin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/antonio_ratti_textile_center/Length_of_Velvet/viewObject.aspx?&amp;OID=200010488&amp;PgSz=1 |title=Length of Velvet, Late 15th century |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511222157/http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/antonio_ratti_textile_center/Length_of_Velvet/viewObject.aspx?&amp;OID=200010488&amp;PgSz=1 |archivedate=11 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}. the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

As prosperity grew in the 15th century, the urban middle classes, including skilled workers, began to wear more complex clothes that followed, at a distance, the fashions set by the elites. National variations in clothing increased over the century.&lt;ref name="Boucher"&gt;Boucher&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Modern Europe===

[[File:Isabella Rubens.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A French reinterpretation of Spanish fashion, with elaborate reticella ruff, 1609]]
By the first half of the 16th century, the clothing of the Low Countries, German states, and Scandinavia had developed in a different direction than that of England, France, and Italy, although all absorbed the sobering and formal influence of Spanish dress after the mid-1520s.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, pp. 219, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborate slashing was popular, especially in Germany. Black was increasingly worn for the most formal occasions. [[Bobbin lace]] arose from [[passementerie]] in the mid-16th century, probably in [[Flanders]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Montupet, Janine, and Ghislaine Schoeller: ''Lace: The Elegant Web'', {{ISBN|0-8109-3553-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This century also saw the rise of the [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]], which grew from a mere ruffle at the neckline of the shirt or chemise to immense cartwheel shapes. At their most extravagant, ruffs required wire supports and were made of fine Italian [[reticella]], a cutwork linen lace.

By the turn of the 17th century, a sharp distinction could be seen between the sober fashions favored by Protestants in England and the Netherlands, which still showed heavy Spanish influence, and the light, revealing fashions of the French and Italian courts.

The great flowering of [[needlelace]] occurred in this period. Geometric reticella deriving from cutwork was elaborated into true needlelace or ''punto in aria'' (called in England "point lace"), which reflected the scrolling floral designs popular for embroidery. Lacemaking centers were established in France to reduce the outflow of cash to Italy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayrose.org/AandS/handouts/reticella_rev.pdf Berry, Robin L.: "Reticella: a walk through the beginnings of Lace"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hXJYnebe?url=http://www.bayrose.org/AandS/handouts/reticella_rev.pdf |date=14 June 2009 }} (2004) (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kliot, Jules and Kaethe: ''The Needle-Made Lace of Reticella'', Lacis Publications, Berkeley, CA, 1994. {{ISBN|0-916896-57-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[early modern Europe]], there was significant demand for textiles from Mughal India, including [[cotton]] textiles and [[silk]] products.&lt;ref name="schmidt"&gt;Karl J. Schmidt (2015), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BqdzCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 ''An Atlas and Survey of South Asian History'', page 100], [[Routledge]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[1650–1700 in Western European fashion|European fashion]], for example, became increasingly dependent on Mughal Indian textiles and silks.

Even though the purdah was made compulsory for the Mughal women, we see that this did not stop themselves from experimenting in style and attire. Abul Fazal mentions that there were sixteen components that adorned a woman. These not only included clothing but also other aspects like that of oiling the body and iqtar. Mughal women wore long loose jamas with full sleeves and in winters it was accompanied by a Qaba or a Kashmir shawl used as a coat. Women were very fond of their perfumes and scents. Jewellery in the Mughal tradition signified not only religious values but also style statements.

===Pre-Colonial North America===
Across North America, native people constructed clothing using natural fibers such as cotton and agave as well as leather skins from animals such as deer or beavers. When traders and colonists came from Europe, they brought with them sheep and travelers highly valued the beaver pelts in particular for their warmth. Beaver pelt trade was one of the first commercial endeavors of colonial North America and a cause of the [[Beaver Wars]].

==Enlightenment and the Colonial period==
{{main|1700–1750 in fashion|1750–1795 in fashion}}
During the 18th century, distinction was made between ''full dress'' worn at Court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress which had all but disappeared by the end of the century. Full dress followed the styles of the French court, where rich silks and elaborate embroidery reigned. Men continued to wear the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] for both full dress and undress; these were now sometimes made of the same fabric and trim, signalling the birth of the three-piece [[suit (clothes)|suit]].

Women's silhouettes featured small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]] in the 1730s and early 1740s, which were displaced for formal court wear by side hoops or [[pannier (clothing)|panniers]] which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the court of [[Marie Antoinette]]. Fashion reached heights of fantasy and [[Rococo|abundant ornamentation]], before new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits and a long-simmering movement toward simplicity and democratization of dress under the influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and the [[American Revolution]] led to an entirely new mode and the triumph of British woollen tailoring following the [[French Revolution]].

For women's dresses, Indian cottons, especially printed [[chintz]]es, were imported to Europe in large numbers, and towards the end of the period simple white [[muslin]] gowns were in fashion.

==Industrial revolution==

They changed a lot during 18th and 19th of century with the addition of new types of colors (like [[aniline]] dyes), placement of colors (like lengthwise stripes) and with the addition of new elements (like waistcoats). By the end of the 19th century they went out of use in most of the country (except more remote places as in [[Kihnu]] island) and it was only in mid 20th century when they once again gained popularity and now as a formal clothing.

{{Main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}
During the [[industrial revolution]], fabric production was [[mechanised]] with machines powered by [[waterwheel]]s and [[steam-engine]]s. Production shifted from small cottage based production to mass production based on assembly line organisation. Clothing production, on the other hand, continued to be made by hand.

[[Sewing machine]]s emerged in the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/cs/inventorsalphabet/a/loom_4.htm Spindel, Loom, and Needle] – History of the Textile Industry&lt;/ref&gt; streamlining clothing production.

Alongside these developments were changes in the types and style of clothing produced. During the 1960s, had a major influence on subsequent developments in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/0-9/1960s-fashion/ History of 1960s Fashion and Textiles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704113551/http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/0-9/1960s-fashion/ |date=4 July 2011 }}. Vam.ac.uk. Retrieved on 1 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Textiles were not only made in factories. Before this, they were made in local and national markets. Dramatic change in transportation throughout the nation is one source that encouraged the use of factories. New advances such as steamboats, canals, and railroads lowered shipping costs which caused people to buy cheap goods that were produced in other places instead of more expensive goods that were produced locally. Between 1810 and 1840, the development of a national market prompted manufacturing which tripled the output’s worth. This increase in production created a change in industrial methods, such as the use of factories instead of hand made woven materials that families usually made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. J. Rorabaugh|title=The Alcoholic Republic: An American Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AUH0vchHRIC&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=1 January 2012|date=17 September 1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-502990-1|pages=129–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the people who worked in the factories were women. Women went to work in textile factories for a number of reasons. Some women left home to live on their own because of crowding at home; or to save for future marriage portions. The work enabled them to see more of the world, to earn something in anticipation of marriage, and to ease the crowding within the home. They also did it to make money for family back home. The money they sent home was to help out with the trouble some of the farmers were having. They also worked in the millhouses because they could gain a sense of independence and growth as a personal goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Dublin|title=Transforming women's work: New England lives in the industrial revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTfTKyrIGfgC&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=1 January 2012|date=August 1995|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8090-4|pages=82–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century developments==

The 20th century is marked by new applications for textiles as well as inventions in synthetic fibers and computerized manufacturing control systems.

===Unions and Education===

In the early 20th century, workers in the clothing and textile industries became [[Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union|unionized]] in the United States. Later in the 20th century, the industry had expanded to such a degree that such educational institutions as UC Davis established a Division of Textiles and Clothing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://textiles.ucdavis.edu/history.htm UC Davis Department of Textiles and Clothing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827045122/http://textiles.ucdavis.edu/history.htm |date=27 August 2007 }} History&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Nebraska-Lincoln also created a Department of Textiles, Clothing and Design that offers a Masters of Arts in Textile History,&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.custompresence.com/english/quiltstudy.org/includes/downloads/3_gradinfothesis.pdf University of Nebraska-Lincoln Department of Textiles, Clothing and Design M.A. in Textile History] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5taw6tWzc?url=https://secure.custompresence.com/english/quiltstudy.org/includes/downloads/3_gradinfothesis.pdf |date=19 October 2010 }}.

Retrieved on 1 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and Iowa State University established a Department of Textiles and Clothing that features a History of costume collection, 1865–1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/arch/rgrp/12-10-5.html Iowa State University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115053433/http://www.lib.iastate.edu/arch/rgrp/12-10-5.html |date=15 January 2008 }} College of Family and Consumer Sciences.

===New Applications===

The changing lifestyles, activities, and demands of the 20th century favored clothing producers who could more effectively make their products have desired properties, such as increased strength, elasticity, or durability. These properties may be implemented through mechanical solutions, such as different weaving and knitting patterns, by modifications to the fibers, or by finishing (textiles) of the textiles. Since the 1960s, it has been possible to finish textiles to resist stains, flames, wrinkles, and microbial life. Advancement in dye technology allowed for coloring of previously difficult-to-dye natural fibers and synthetic fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Textiles, 12th edition | author1 = Sara J. Kadolph | author2 = Sara B. Marcketti | publisher = Pearson |date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic Fibers===

Following the invention of plastics by petroleum and chemical corporations, fibers could now be made synthetically. Advancements in fiber spinning actuators and control systems allow control over fiber diameter and shape, so Synthetic fibers, may be engineered with more precision than natural fibers. Fibers invented between between 1930 and 1970 include nylon, PTFE, polyester, Spandex, and Kevlar. Clothing producers soon adopted synthetic fibers, often using blends of different fibers for optimized properties.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic fibers can be knit and woven similarly to natural fibers.

===Automation and Numeric Control===

The early 20th century continued the advances of the Industrial Revolution. In The procedural loops required for mechanized textile knitting and weaving already used logic were encoded in punch-cards and tapes. Since the machines were already computers, the invention of small-scale electronics and microcontrollers did not immediately change the possible functions of these machines. In the 1960s, existing machines became outfitted with computerized numeric control (CNC) systems, enabling more accurate and efficient actuation. In 1983, Bonas Machine Company Ltd. presented the first computer-controlled, [[Jacquard_loom#Electronic_Jacquard_looms | electronic, Jacquard loom]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bonas.be/en/about-us Bonas.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1988, the first US patent was awarded for a "pick and place" robot. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country=US | number=4872258A| pubdate=1988-09-22 | inventor=Philip A Ragard | url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4872258A/en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements such as these changed the nature of work for machine operators, introducing computer literacy as a skill alongside machine literacy. Advances in sensing technology and data processing of the 20th century include the spectrophotometer for color matching and automatic inspection machines.

These propulsion technologies are intended to provide effective [[exploration]] of our [[Solar System]] and will permit mission designers to plan missions to "fly anytime, anywhere, and complete a host of science objectives at the destinations" and with greater reliability and safety. With a wide range of possible missions and candidate propulsion technologies, the question of which technologies are "best" for future missions is a difficult one. A portfolio of propulsion technologies should be developed to provide optimum solutions for a diverse set of missions and destinations.&lt;ref name=meyer&gt;

'''In-space propulsion''' begins where the [[upper stage]] of the [[launch vehicle]] leaves off; performing the functions of [[rocket propulsion|primary propulsion]], [[reaction engine|reaction control]], [[orbital station-keeping|station keeping]], [[attitude control|precision pointing]], and [[orbital maneuver]]ing. The [[rocket engine|main engine]]s used in [[space]] provide the primary propulsive force for [[Geostationary orbit|orbit transfer]], [[Hohmann transfer orbit|planetary trajectories]] and extra [[List of landings on extraterrestrial bodies|planetary landing]] and [[wikt:ascent|ascent]]. The reaction control and orbital maneuvering systems provide the propulsive force for orbit maintenance, position control, station keeping, and spacecraft attitude control.&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;&lt;ref name=mason/&gt;&lt;ref name=leone/&gt;

==Current technology==
A large fraction of the [[rocket engine]]s in use today are [[Rocket engine#Chemically powered|chemical rockets]]; that is, they obtain the energy needed to generate thrust by [[chemical reactions]] to create a hot gas that is expanded to produce [[thrust]]. A significant limitation of [[Rocket engine#Chemically powered|chemical propulsion]] is that it has a relatively low [[specific impulse]] (Isp), which is the [[ratio]] of the thrust produced to the [[mass|mass of propellant]] needed at a certain [[Mass flow rate|rate of flow]].&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;

[[File:Ion Engine Test Firing - GPN-2000-000482.jpg|thumb|right|225px|NASA's 2.3 kW NSTAR [[ion thruster]] for the [[Deep Space&amp;nbsp;1]] spacecraft during a hot fire test at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.]]

A significant improvement (above 30%) in specific impulse can be obtained by using [[cryogenic propellant]]s, such as [[liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid hydrogen]], for example. Historically, these propellants have not been applied beyond [[rocket stage|upper stages]]. Furthermore, numerous concepts for advanced propulsion technologies, such as [[electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]], are commonly used for station keeping on commercial [[communications satellites]] and for prime propulsion on some [[space exploration|scientific space missions]] because they have significantly higher values of specific impulse. However, they generally have very small values of thrust and therefore must be operated for long durations to provide the total impulse required by a mission.&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;&lt;ref name=tomsik&gt;Tomsik, Thomas M. "[http://thehuwaldtfamily.org/jtrl/research/Propulsion/Rocket%20Propulsion/NASA-TM-2000-209941,%20Advances%20in%20Cryo%20Propellant%20Densification%20Technology.pdf Recent advances and applications in cryogenic propellant densification technology]."

"NASA’s electric propulsion program." 27th International Electric Propulsion Conference, Pasadena, CA, IEPC-01-002. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of these technologies offer performance that is significantly better than that achievable with chemical propulsion.

==Metrics==
In-space propulsion represents technologies that can significantly improve a number of critical aspects of the mission. [[Space exploration]] is about getting somewhere safely (mission enabling), getting there quickly (reduced transit times), getting a lot of mass there (increased [[payload (air and space craft)|payload]] mass), and getting there cheaply (lower cost). The simple act of "getting" there requires the employment of an in-space propulsion system, and the other metrics are modifiers to this fundamental action.&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;&lt;ref name=leone/&gt;

Development of technologies will result in technical solutions that improve thrust levels, Isp, power, [[specific mass]], (or [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]]), volume, system mass, system complexity, operational complexity, commonality with other spacecraft systems, manufacturability, durability, and cost. These types of improvements will yield decreased transit times, increased payload mass, safer spacecraft, and decreased costs. In some instances, development of technologies within this TA will result in mission- enabling breakthroughs that will revolutionize space exploration. There is no single propulsion technology that will benefit all missions or mission types. The requirements for in-space propulsion vary widely due according to their intended application. The described technologies should support everything from small [[satellite]]s and [[deep space exploration|robotic deep space exploration]] to [[space stations]] and [[Manned mission to Mars|human missions to Mars applications]].&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;&lt;ref name=leone/&gt;

===Technology area breakdown===
The technology areas are divided into four basic groups: (1) Chemical propulsion, (2) Nonchemical propulsion, (3) Advanced propulsion technologies, and (4) Supporting technologies; based on the physics of the propulsion system and how it derives thrust as well as its technical maturity. Additionally, there may be credible meritorious in-space propulsion concepts not foreseen or reviewed at the time of publication, and which may be shown to be beneficial to future mission applications.&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;

===Defining technologies===
Furthermore, the term "mission pull" defines a technology or a performance characteristic necessary to meet a planned NASA mission requirement. Any other relationship between a technology and a mission (an alternate propulsion system, for example) is categorized as "technology push." Also, a space demonstration refers to the spaceflight of a scaled version of a particular technology or of a critical technology subsystem. On the other hand, a space validation would serve as a qualification flight for future mission implementation. A successful validation flight would not require any additional space testing of a particular technology before it can be adopted for a science or exploration mission.&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;

==The challenge==
For both human and robotic exploration, traversing the solar system is a struggle against time and distance. The most distant planets are 4.5–6 billion kilometers from the Sun and to reach them in any reasonable time requires much more capable propulsion systems than conventional chemical rockets. Rapid inner solar system missions with flexible launch dates are difficult, requiring propulsion systems that are beyond today's current state of the art. The logistics, and therefore the total system mass required to support sustained human exploration beyond Earth to destinations such as the Moon, Mars or Near Earth Objects,
are daunting unless more efficient in-space propulsion technologies are developed and fielded.&lt;ref name=meyer/&gt;&lt;ref name=huntsb&gt;

==Primary propulsion technologies==
Work being performed at the [[Glenn Research Center]] develops primary propulsion technologies that can benefit near and mid-term science missions by reducing cost, mass and/or travel times. The In-Space Program is working to develop next generation [[electric propulsion]] technologies, including Ion and Hall thrusters.  Solar Sails, which are a form of propellantless propulsion, are also being developed. [[Solar sail]]s rely on the naturally occurring sunlight for the propulsion energy. Other propulsion technologies being developed include advanced chemical propulsion and aerocapture.&lt;ref name=leone/&gt;&lt;ref name=grcspace&gt;[http://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/SSPO/ISPTProg/ In-Space Propulsion Program].Glenn Research Center.

'''Infrared multiple photon dissociation''' ('''IRMPD''') is a technique used in [[mass spectrometry]] to [[fragmentation (mass spectrometry)|fragment]] molecules in the gas phase usually for structural analysis of the original (parent) molecule.&lt;ref name="pmid7526742"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Little DP, Speir JP, Senko MW, O'Connor PB, McLafferty FW | title = Infrared multiphoton dissociation of large multiply charged ions for biomolecule sequencing | journal = Anal. Chem. | volume = 66 | issue = 18 | pages = 2809–15 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7526742 | doi =10.1021/ac00090a004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
An [[infrared]] [[laser]] is directed through a window into the [[vacuum]] of the [[mass spectrometer]] where the ions are. The mechanism of fragmentation involves the absorption by a given [[ion]] of multiple [[infrared]] [[photon]]s. The parent ion becomes excited into more energetic [[oscillation|vibration]]al states until a bond(s) is broken resulting in gas phase fragments of the parent ion.  In the case of powerful laser pulses, the dissociation proceeds via inner-valence ionization of electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Talebpour | display-authors = etal   | title = Multiphoton ionization of inner-valence electrons and fragmentation of ethylene in an intense Ti:sapphire laser pulse | url = | year=1999 |journal=Chemical Physics Letters | volume = 313 | issue = 5-6| pages = 789–794 | doi=10.1016/s0009-2614(99)01075-1|bibcode = 1999CPL...313..789T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Talebpour | display-authors = etal   | title = Dissociative ionization of benzene in intense ultra-fast laser pulses | url = | year=2000 |journal=J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. | volume = 33 | issue = 21| pages = 4615–4626 | doi=10.1088/0953-4075/33/21/307|bibcode = 2000JPhB...33.4615T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRMPD is most often used in [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]] mass spectrometry.&lt;ref name="pmid15389858"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laskin J, Futrell JH | title = Activation of large ions in FT-ICR mass spectrometry | journal = Mass spectrometry reviews | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–67 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15389858 | doi = 10.1002/mas.20012| bibcode = 2005MSRv...24..135L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy ==
By applying intense tunable IR lasers, like IR-[[Optical parametric oscillator|OPO]]s or IR [[free electron laser]]s, the wavelength dependence of the IRMPD yield can be studied.&lt;ref name=Polfer2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Polfer | first =  Nick C. | year = 2007 | title = Reaction products in mass spectrometry elucidated with infrared spectroscopy | journal = Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics | volume = 9 | pages = 3804–17 | doi = 10.1039/b702993b | pmid = 17637973 | last2 = Oomens | first2 = J | issue = 29 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; |bibcode = 2007PCCP....9.3804P }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[infrared photodissociation spectroscopy]] allows for the measurement of vibrational spectra of (unstable) species that can only be prepared in the gas phase. Such species include molecular ions but also neutral species like metal clusters that can be gently ionized after interaction with the IR light for their mass spectrometric detection.&lt;ref name=Au20Gruene2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gruene P, Rayner DM, Redlich B, van der Meer AF, Lyon JT, Meijer G, Fielicke A | title = Structures of Neutral Au7, Au19, and Au20 Clusters in the Gas Phase | journal = Science | volume = 321 | pages = 674–6 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1126/science.1161166 | pmid = 18669858 | issue = 5889|bibcode = 2008Sci...321..674G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isotope separation==
Due to the relatively large differences in IR absorption frequencies that are due to different resonance frequencies for molecules containing different isotopes, this technique has been suggested as a way to perform [[Isotope separation]] with difficult-to-separate isotopes, in a single pass. For example, molecules of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; containing U-235 might be ionized completely as a result of such a laser resonance, leaving UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; containing the heavier U-238 intact.

'''Larry Johnson''' (born December 17, 1950, in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]]) is an [[United States|American]]  futurist, author, and educator.  Currently, Johnson serves as the Founder and CEO of EdFutures.org,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edfutures.org/team/]&lt;/ref&gt; an international think tank, and as a Senior Fellow of the Center for Digital Education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centerdigitaled.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2001-2016, he served as Chief Executive Officer of the [[New Media Consortium]] an international consortium of hundreds of universities, colleges,  museums, research centers, and technology companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmc.org/membership NMC.org (member list)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
The annual [[Horizon Report]] is the most visible component of the Horizon Project, which Johnson founded and led from its inception in 2002 until 2016.  The report has since become one of the leading tools used by senior executives in universities and museums to set priorities for technology planning in more than 160 countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmc.org/nmc-horizon/&lt;/ref&gt;

He served for nearly 15 years as Chief Executive Officer of the NMC &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmc.org&lt;/ref&gt; and provided leadership in the areas of strategic planning; program development; fundraising; partnerships with business and industry; the development and management of fiscal and human resources; and policy.  Under Johnson's tenure, the New Media Consortium (NMC) grew to be an international not-for-profit consortium of learning-focused organizations dedicated to the exploration and use of new media and new technologies. Its hundreds of member institutions still constitute an elite list of the most highly regarded colleges and universities in the world, as well as leading museums, key research centers, and some of the world's most forward-thinking companies.  Under his leadership, the consortium and its members dedicated themselves to exploring and developing potential applications of emerging technologies for learning, research, and creative inquiry.  The consortium's Horizon Reports, which Johnson founded and directed for more than a decade, are still regarded worldwide as the most timely and authoritative sources of information on new and emerging technologies available to education anywhere.

Johnson has organized summits and large-scale projects around topics such as Visual literacy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmc.org/pdf/Global_Imperative.pdf NMC.org]&lt;/ref&gt; learning objects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmc.org/publications/elusive-vision NMC.org]&lt;/ref&gt; educational gaming,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmc.org/initiatives/educational-gaming NMC.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  the future of scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmc.org/initiatives/new-scholarship NMC.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 3D web.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sl.nmc.org/ sl.NMC.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, Johnson presented testimony to the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet|House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet]] on the nature and state of virtual worlds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-ti-hrg.040108.Johnson-testimony.pdf Energycommerce.house.gov], written testimony.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://energycommerce.edgeboss.net/wmedia/energycommerce/040108.ti.hrg.virtual_worlds.wvx Energycommerce.edgeboss.net], video.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Johnson helped the NMC and the Edward and Betty Marcus Foundation formalize their longstanding collaboration in support of the visual arts in Texas with the launch of the [http://midea.nmc.org Edward and Betty Marcus Institute for Digital Education in the Arts  (MIDEA)], and served as its founding director.  An outgrowth of the earlier Digital Education Project for Texas Art Museums, MIDEA built on that four-year systemic effort to increase the capacity of museums across Texas and beyond to use new media to tell compelling stories about art and their collections. The project provides a hub for Texas museum professionals to learn about and discuss all forms of digital media, as well as ongoing training and support for digital arts education. (The project continues its unique work with Texas art museums that has become known as the Texas Testbed.) The learnings from this project inform the national and international efforts of many museums and museum-based organizations all over the world.

An author of several books, numerous chapters, dozens of articles, and principal investigator for several important national and international studies, he has been recognized for his research by the American Association of Community Colleges&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aacc.nche.edu/ AACC.nche.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113222619/http://www.aacc.nche.edu/ |date=2007-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Association of University Administrators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaua.org/ AAUA.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2016, Johnson marked 35 years of service in higher education, and currently serves as the Founder and CEO of EdFutures.org,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edfutures.org/team/]&lt;/ref&gt; an international think tank, and as a Senior Fellow of the Center for Digital Education. From 2001-2016, he served as CEO of the New Media Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redarchive.nmc.org/about/board-directors/larry-johnson-chief-executive-officer]&lt;/ref&gt; He served previously as president and CEO of [[Fox Valley Technical College]], a community college serving more than 20,000 FTE in Appleton, Wisconsin.  His experiential base includes service at both very large and very small institutions and positions at every level and across all the major areas of college and university work.

Between 1993 and 1996, he served as vice president for the League for Innovation in the Community College,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.league.org League for Innovation in the Community College League.org]&lt;/ref&gt; working at the national level to take the story of community colleges to governmental, foundation, and corporate leaders across the country.  As director of the League's Information Technology Initiative, he coordinated what was at the time the world’s largest higher education technology conference, the international Conference of Information Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.league.org/league/partners/confer_profile.htm#cit League.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has served on a number of boards, including his current role on the governing board of the Institute for Learning Innovation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instituteforlearninginnovation.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Leadership Advisory Board of the Center for Learning Innovation and Custimized Knowledge Solutions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cli-cks.com/about-us/leadership-advisory-board/]&lt;/ref&gt; in Dubai.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">[[File:Smartsweep 1.jpg|thumb|Tow lawn sweepers can be attached to lawn tractors]]
A '''lawn sweeper''', also known as a '''leaf sweeper''', is a garden [[tool]] for the mechanical removal of debris, such as fallen [[leaf|leaves]], pine needles, twigs, [[lawnmower|grass clippings]] or [[litter]], from a [[lawn]] or paved area. Lawn sweepers operate via a rotating [[brush]] mechanism that sweeps up the debris and deposits it in a collection [[hopper (particulate collection container)|hopper]] for disposal.

==Types==
[[File:Push Sweeper.jpg|thumb|Push lawn sweepers are lightweight and ideal for smaller lawns]]
Push lawn sweepers, which resemble a simple wheeled manual [[lawn mower]], are maneuvered and powered by hand. A forward pushing action transfers power from the wheels to the brush mechanism via a [[gear|gearing system]], causing it to rotate, and the debris is picked up and transferred to a bag or hopper mounted on the machine. Powered lawn sweepers resemble push lawn sweepers, but the brush mechanism is powered by a [[gasoline]] or [[electricity|electric]] [[engine|motor]]. Tow lawn sweepers are towed behind a vehicle, such as a garden [[tractor]] or [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]] and are designed for use in larger areas. They are generally wider and have greater [[hopper (particulate collection container)|hopper]] capacities than push and powered lawn sweepers.

==Alternatives==
[[File:Valhallavägen höststädning 2010.jpg|thumb|Vacuum sweeper towed by a tractor in Sweden]]
Lawn sweepers are an alternative to [[Rake (tool)|raking]] or the use of [[leaf blower]]s and garden vacuums. They are also an alternative to lawn mower baggers or grass baggers which are generally more expensive and have a smaller capacity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">A '''lifeline''' is a [[fall protection]] [[safety device]] in the form of an open fence composed of [[wire rope|wire]] and [[stanchion]]s secured around the perimeter of an area to prevent accidental falls.  It is commonly found on [[sailboat]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seatalk.info/cgi-bin/nautical-marine-sailing-dictionary/db.cgi?db=db&amp;uid=default&amp;FirstLetter=l&amp;sb=Term&amp;view_records=View+Records&amp;nh=4 ''Lifeline'' at Seatalk Nautical Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[construction site]]s,&lt;ref name=diversified&gt;[https://www.fallprotect.com/fall-protection-solutions/horizontal-lifelines/ Diversified Fall Protection: "Horizontal lifelines are common fall protection solutions in work areas that lack existing anchor points for personnel tie–off."] &lt;/ref&gt; as well as other situations where dangerous falls can occur, such as at [[scenic overlook]]s and in [[cave]]s.

Lifeline wire has traditionally been available in 1/8" and 3/16" wire diameters, with a soft but durable vinyl coating increasing the effective diameters to 7/32" and 5/16" respectively.&lt;ref name=west&gt;[https://www.westmarine.com/WestAdvisor/When-and-How-to-Replace-Your-Lifelines West Marine: When and How to Replace Your Lifelines]&lt;/ref&gt; It
should be inspected on an annual basis for signs of corrosion or breakage of wire strands.&lt;ref name=west/&gt;

In simplest form, a land-based lifeline consists of a horizontal wire rope cable attached to two or more anchor points on a roof-top, crane runway, bridge or outdoor construction site, or any other elevated work area that poses a fall risk.&lt;ref name=diversified/&gt; [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] defines an [[anchorage]] in a fall protection system "a secure point of attachment for lifelines, lanyards, or deceleration devices".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3146.pdf OSHA: Fall Protection in Construction]&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction site lifeline systems include dedicated attachment brackets, [[Lanyard#Lineman_lanyards|safety lanyard]]s and [[safety harness|harnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://simplifiedsafety.com/fall-protection-lifelines/lifelines/lifeline-kits/construction-lifeline/ Construction Lifelines]&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction lifeline systems may be subdivided into those used to arrest workers in the event of a fall ([[fall arrest|active systems]]), or restrain workers from reaching a fall hazard ([[fall prevention|restraint systems]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://simplifiedsafety.com/fall-protection-lifelines/ Fall Protection Lifelines at Simplified Safety]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Noguchi table''' is a piece of [[modernist]] furniture first produced in the mid-20th century. Introduced by [[Herman Miller (manufacturer)|Herman Miller]] in 1947, it was designed in the United States by Japanese American artist and industrial designer [[Isamu Noguchi]]. The Noguchi table comprises a wooden base composed of two identical curved wood pieces, and a heavy plate glass top.

==History==
The Noguchi table was an evolution of a [[rosewood]] and glass table Noguchi designed in 1939 for [[Anson Goodyear|A. Conger Goodyear]], president of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="Pina"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pina | first = Leslie | authorlink = Leslie Pina | title = Classic Herman Miller | publisher = Schiffer Publishing | year = 1998 | location = Atglen, Pennsylvania | isbn = 0-7643-0471-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design team at Herman Miller was so impressed by the table's use of [[biomorphism]] that they recruited Noguchi to design a similar table with a freeform sculptural base and biomorphic glass top for use in both residential and office environments.&lt;ref name="Pina" /&gt; 

The 1947 Herman Miller catalog described the Noguchi coffee table as "sculpture-for-use" and "design for production".&lt;ref name="Pina" /&gt; The base was carved from solid walnut, and consisted of two identical parts; when one part "is reversed and connected to the other by a pivot rod, a base appears which has a smoothly flowing form and an interest rarely found in furniture of any period".&lt;ref name="Pina" /&gt; The shape of the two wooden supports produces a self-supporting and stable base, allowing the heavy plate glass top to be placed without the use of connectors.&lt;ref name="Pina" /&gt;

==Construction==
The base was originally produced in [[walnut]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]].&lt;ref name="Pina" /&gt; It was later offered in [[ebonized]] walnut. Cherry bases were made only during the first year the table was on the market, and have been highly sought since. Birch bases were discontinued after 1954.&lt;ref name="Pina" /&gt; As of 2016, the table is available in an ebonized finish, walnut, white ash and natural cherry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.hermanmiller.com/Products/Noguchi-Table|title=Noguchi Table - Coffee Tables - Desks and Tables -  Herman Miller Official Store|first=Herman|last=Miller|date=|work=HermanMiller.com|access-date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top was originally issued in {{convert|7/8|in|mm|adj=on}} heavy plate glass. In 1965, the thickness of the top was reduced to {{convert|3/4|in|mm}}, and its base height was raised, increasing the table's total height from {{convert|15|in}} to {{convert|15.75|in}}.&lt;ref name="Pina" /&gt;

Since the late 1980s, indexing pins have been installed on the pivot rod with matching slots milled into the legs to ensure that the two leg elements are set up at a 52-degree angle for maximum aesthetic appeal and optimal stability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermanmiller.com/content/dam/store/assembly_instructions/Noguchi_Table_Assembly_Instructions.pdf Noguchi_Table_Assembly_Instructions.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The Noguchi table became one of Herman Miller's most iconic and successful designs. Production ceased in 1973, and the piece became an instant collectible. Herman Miller reissued it in 1980 in a limited edition of about 480 tables. The table was reintroduced again in 1984 for the "Herman Miller Classics" line, and has been in production ever since.&lt;ref name="Pina" /&gt;

==Examples==
Despite their status as modern classics, Noguchi tables are widely available and relatively affordable.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2017}} This is at least partly because they were in constant production from 1947 until 1973, returned to production in 1984, and have been produced ever since. In addition, the table is very durable, and few have been lost over the years. The base can be dinged and scratched but almost never cracks or breaks. The glass tops are prone to chipping along the edges and scratching on the upper surface, but are so large and heavy they rarely break. The table can support a great weight{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2017}} without damage. Earlier tables are easily distinguished by their ⅞-inch thick tops, but do not command much premium over the current lighter and easier-to-handle ¾″ models. Buyers can expect to pay $500 and up for an undamaged example, and $1,500 and up for an early version in birch. Only the 1947 cherry tables are truly rare collectibles, which rarely show up for sale except at high-end auctions.
* Two Noguchi tables, one in natural birch and one in ebonized birch, are in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. 
* A Noguchi table in ebonized birch is on display at [[The Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].

'''''Panicum virgatum''''', commonly known as '''switchgrass''', is a [[perennial]] warm season [[bunchgrass]] native to North America, where it occurs naturally from [[55th parallel north|55°N latitude]] in [[Canada]] southwards into the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]].  Switchgrass is one of the dominant [[species]] of the central [[North America]]n [[tallgrass prairie]] and can be found in remnant [[prairie]]s, in native grass [[pasture]]s, and naturalized along roadsides.  It is used primarily for [[soil conservation]], [[forage]] production, game cover, as an [[ornamental grass]], in [[phytoremediation]] projects, fiber, electricity, heat production, for [[biosequestration]] of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], and more recently as a [[biomass]] crop for [[ethanol]] and [[butanol]].

Other common names for switchgrass include tall panic grass, Wobsqua grass, blackbent, tall prairiegrass, wild [[Agrostis|redtop]], thatchgrass, and Virginia switchgrass.

==Description==
[[File:Switchgrass roots.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2.27|Root system of switchgrass grown at the [[Land Institute]]]]
Switchgrass is a hardy, deep-rooted, [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[rhizome|rhizomatous]] grass that begins growth in late [[spring (season)|spring]]. It can grow up to {{cvt|2.7|m}} high, but is typically shorter than [[big bluestem]] grass or [[indiangrass]]. The [[Leaf|leaves]] are {{cvt|30|–|90|cm}} long, with a prominent midrib. Switchgrass uses [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; carbon fixation]], giving it an advantage in conditions of [[drought]] and high temperature.&lt;ref name = Silzer&gt;{{cite web

The seeds are 3–6&amp;nbsp;mm long and up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm wide, and are developed from a single-flowered [[spikelet]]. Both [[glume]]s are present and well developed. When ripe, the seeds sometimes take on a pink or dull-purple tinge, and turn golden brown with the foliage of the plant in the fall. Switchgrass is both a perennial and self-seeding crop, which means farmers do not have to plant and reseed after annual harvesting. Once established, a switchgrass stand can survive for ten years or longer.&lt;ref name="plentiful_switchgrass"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike corn, switchgrass can grow on marginal lands and requires relatively modest levels of [[chemical fertilizer]]s.&lt;ref name="plentiful_switchgrass"/&gt;  Overall, it is considered a resource-efficient, low-input crop for producing bioenergy from farmland.

==Habitat==
Much of North America, especially the prairies of the Midwestern United States, was once prime habitat to vast swaths of native grasses, including switchgrass, [[indiangrass]] (''Sorghastrum nutans''), eastern gamagrass (''[[Tripsacum dactyloides]]''), [[big bluestem]] (''Andropogon gerardi''), [[little bluestem]] (''Schizachyrium scoparium'')&lt;ref name = ESI&gt;{{FEIS |genus=Panicum |species=virgatum |type=graminoid |last=Uchytil |first=Ronald J. |date=1993 | accessdate = 2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.  As [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlers]] began spreading west across the continent, the native grasses were plowed under and the land converted to crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[wheat]], and [[oat]]s. Introduced grasses such as [[fescue]], [[Poa|bluegrass]], and [[orchardgrass]]&lt;ref name = Ernst&gt;{{cite web

== Distribution ==
Switchgrass is a versatile and adaptable plant.  It can grow and even thrive in many weather conditions, lengths of growing seasons, soil types, and land conditions. Its distribution spans south of latitude 55°N from [[Saskatchewan]] to [[Nova Scotia]], south over most of the [[United States]] east of the [[Rocky Mountains]], and further south into [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="PAVI2_profile"&gt;{{PLANTS |symbol=PAVI2 |taxon=Panicum virgatum |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a warm-season [[perennial]] grass, most of its growth occurs from late spring through early fall; it becomes dormant and unproductive during colder months.  Thus, the productive season in its northern habitat can be as short as three months, but in the southern reaches of its habitat the growing season may be as long as eight months, around the [[Gulf Coast]] area.&lt;ref name="ball_2002_southern_forages"&gt;{{cite book

Switchgrass is a diverse species, with striking differences between plants.  This diversity, which presumably reflects evolution and adaptation to new environments as the species spread across the continent, provides a range of valuable traits for breeding programs.  Switchgrass has two distinct forms, or "cytotypes": the lowland [[cultivar]]s, which tend to produce more biomass, and the upland cultivars, which are generally of more northern origin, more cold-tolerant, and therefore usually preferred in northern areas.  Upland switchgrass types are generally shorter (≤ 2.4&amp;nbsp;m, tall) and less coarse than lowland types.  Lowland cultivars may grow to ≥ 2.7&amp;nbsp;m, in favorable environments.  Both upland and lowland cultivars are deeply rooted (&gt; 1.8&amp;nbsp;m, in favorable soils) and have short [[rhizome]]s. The upland types tend to have more vigorous rhizomes, so the lowland cultivars may appear to have a [[bunchgrass]] habit, while the upland types tend to be more sod-forming. Lowland cultivars appear more plastic in their morphology, produce larger plants if stands become thin or when planted in wide rows, and they seem to be more sensitive to moisture stress than upland cultivars.&lt;ref name="Parrish et al."&gt;Establishing and Managing Switchgrass as an Energy Crop, Forage and Grazinglands, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In native prairies, switchgrass is historically found in association with several other important native [[tallgrass prairie]] plants, such as big bluestem, indiangrass, little bluestem, [[sideoats grama]], eastern gamagrass, and various [[forbs]] ([[sunflowers]], [[gayfeather]], [[prairie clover]], and prairie coneflower).  These widely adapted tallgrass species once occupied millions of hectares.&lt;ref name="Rinehart"&gt;Switchgrass as a Bioenergy Crop, ATTRA - National Sustainable Agricultural Information Service, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Switchgrass’ suitability for cultivation in the [[Gran Chaco]] is being studied by Argentina’s [[Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria]] (INTA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | title = Aprovechamiento de recursos vegetales y animales para la produccion de biocombustibles   | language = Spanish   | publisher = INTA   | date = 26 June 2008   | url = http://www.inta.gov.ar/iir/investiga/proyectos/pebiocombustibles.pdf   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100926025739/http%3A//www.inta.gov.ar/iir/investiga/proyectos/pebiocombustibles.pdf   | archivedate = 26 September 2010   | df =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and management==
Switchgrass can be grown on land considered unsuitable for [[row crop]] production, including land that is too [[erosion|erodible]] for [[Maize|corn]] production, as well as [[sand]]y and [[gravel]]ly soils in [[humid]] regions that typically produce low [[crop yield|yields]] of other [[farm]] crops.  No single method of establishing switchgrass can be suggested for all situations. The crop can be established both by [[no-till]] and conventional [[tillage]]. When seeded as part of a diverse mixture, planting guidelines for warm-season grass mixtures for conservation plantings should be followed. Regional guidelines for growing and managing switchgrass for bioenergy or conservation plantings are available. Several key factors can increase the likelihood of success for establishing switchgrass. These include:&lt;ref name="Parrish et al. 2008"&gt;[http://reap-canada.com/online_library/feedstock_biomass/5-Establishing%20and%20Managing%20Switchgrass%20as%20an%20Energy%20Crop%20_Parrish%20et%20al.,%202008.pdf] David J. Parrish, John H. Fike, David I. Bransby, Roger Samson. Establishing and Managing Switchgrass as an Energy Crop.  Forage and Grazinglands. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* Planting switchgrass after the soil is well warmed during the spring.
* Using seeds that are highly [[germination|germinable]] and planting 0.6 - 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm deep, or up to 2&amp;nbsp;cm deep in sandy soils.
* Packing or firming the soil both before and after seeding.
* Providing no [[fertilizer|fertilization]] at planting to minimize competition.
* Controlling [[weed]]s with chemical and/or cultural control methods.
[[Mowing]] and properly labeled [[herbicides]] are recommended for [[weed control]]. Chemical weed control can be used in the [[fall]] prior to establishment, or before or after planting.  Weeds should be mowed just above the height of the growing switchgrass. [[Hormone]] herbicides, such as [[2,4-D]], should be avoided as they are known to reduce development of switchgrass when applied early in the establishing year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nmsp.css.cornell.edu/publications/factsheets/factsheet20.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122050432/http://nmsp.css.cornell.edu/publications/factsheets/factsheet20.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plantings that appear to have failed due to weed infestations are often wrongly assessed, as the failure is often more apparent than real. Switchgrass stands that are initially weedy commonly become well established with appropriate management in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Parrish et al. 2008"/&gt;
Once established, switchgrass can take up to three years to reach its full production potential.&lt;ref name="samson_2007"/&gt; Depending on the region, it can typically produce 1/4 to 1/3 of its yield potential in its first year and 2/3 of its potential in the year after seeding.&lt;ref name="bransby_2005"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishment, switchgrass management will depend on the goal of the seeding. Historically, most switchgrass seedings have been managed for the [[Conservation Reserve Program]] in the US. Disturbance such as periodic mowing, burning, or disking is required to optimize the stand’s utility for encouraging [[biodiversity]].  Increased attention is being placed on switchgrass management as an [[energy crop]]. Generally, the crop requires modest application of [[nitrogen fertilizer]], as it is not a heavy feeder. Typical nitrogen (N) content of [[Senescence|senescent]] material in the fall is 0.5% N. Fertilizer nitrogen applications of about 5&amp;nbsp;kg N/[[hectare|hectare (ha)]] applied for each [[tonne]] of [[biomass]] removed is a general guideline. More specific recommendations for fertilization are available regionally in [[North America]]. Herbicides are not often used on switchgrass after the seeding year, as the crop is generally quite competitive with weeds. Most bioenergy conversion processes for switchgrass, including those for cellulosic ethanol and pellet fuel production, can generally accept some alternative [[species]] in the [[harvest]]ed [[biomass]].  Stands of switchgrass should be harvested no more than twice per year, and one cutting often provides as much biomass as two. Switchgrass can be harvested with the same [[farm equipment|field equipment]] used for [[hay]] production, and it is well-suited to [[baler|baling]] or bulk field harvesting.  If its [[biology]] is properly taken into consideration, switchgrass can offer great potential as an energy crop.&lt;ref name="Parrish et al. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Samson et al., 2008"&gt;[http://www.reap-canada.com/online_library/feedstock_biomass/Optimization%20of%20switchgrass%20management%20for%20commercial%20fuel%20pellet%20production%20(Samson%20et%20al.,%202007).pdf] Samson, R., Bailey-Stamler, S., &amp; Ho Lem, C.

== Uses ==
Switchgrass can be used as a [[feedstock]] for [[biomass]] energy production, as [[ground cover]] for [[soil conservation]], and to control [[erosion]], for [[forage]]s and [[grazing]], as game cover, and as feedstock for biodegradable plastics.  It can be used by cattle farmers for [[hay]] and [[pasture]] and as a substitute for wheat [[straw]] in many applications, including [[livestock]] bedding, straw bale housing, and as a substrate for growing mushrooms.  [[File:Panicum virgaturn heavy metal switch grass MN 2007.JPG|thumb|''Panicum virgatum'' 'Heavy Metal', an ornamental switchgrass, in early summer]]  Additionally, switchgrass is grown as a drought-resistant [[ornamental grass]] in average to wet soils and in full sun to part shade.

===Moth host plant===
It is the preferred larval host plant of [[Dargida rubripennis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dfg/nhesp/species-and-conservation/nhfacts/dargida-rubripennis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioenergy===
Switchgrass has been researched as a renewable [[bioenergy]] crop since the mid-1980s, because it is a native [[perennial]] warm season [[grass]] with the ability to produce moderate to high [[crop yield|yields]] on marginal farmlands.  It is now being considered for use in several bioenergy conversion processes, including [[cellulosic ethanol]] production, [[biogas]], and direct combustion for [[thermal energy]] applications.  The main [[Agronomy|agronomic]] advantages of switchgrass as a bioenergy crop are its stand longevity, drought and flooding tolerance, relatively low [[herbicide]] and [[fertilizer]] input requirements, ease of management, hardiness in poor soil and climate conditions, and widespread adaptability in [[temperate]] climates.  In some warm humid southern zones, such as [[Alabama]], it has the ability to produce up to 25 oven-dry tonnes per hectare (ODT/ha).  A summary of switchgrass yields across 13 research trial sites in the [[United States]] found the top two cultivars in each trial to yield 9.4 to 22.9 t/ha, with an average yield of 14.6 ODT/ha.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin and Kzos 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaughlin | first1 = S.B. | last2 = Kzos | first2 = L.A. | year = 2005 | title = Development of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) as a bioenergy feedstock in the United States | url = | journal = Biomass and Bioenergy | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 515–535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these yields were recorded on small plot trials, and commercial field sites could be expected to be at least 20% lower than these results.  In the United States, switchgrass yields appear to be highest in warm humid regions with long growing seasons such as the US Southeast and lowest in the dry short season areas of the Northern [[Great Plains]].&lt;ref name="McLaughlin and Kzos 2005"/&gt; The energy inputs required to grow switchgrass are favorable when compared with [[Annual plant|annual seed bearing crops]] such as [[Maize|corn]], [[soybean]], or [[canola]], which can require relatively high energy inputs for field operations, crop drying, and fertilization.  Whole plant [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] perennial [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]] grass feedstocks are desirable biomass energy feedstocks, as they require fewer fossil energy inputs to grow and effectively capture solar energy because of their C4 [[photosynthetic]] system and perennial nature.  One study cites it takes from 0.97 to 1.34 GJ to produce 1 tonne of switchgrass, compared with 1.99 to 2.66 GJ to produce 1 tonne of corn.&lt;ref name="Dale and Kim 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dale | first1 = B. | last2 = Kim | first2 = S. | year = 2004 | title = Cumulative Energy and Global Warming Impact from the Production of Biomass for Biobased Products | url = http://arrahman29.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/lca-use.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 7 | issue = 3–4| pages = 147–162 | doi = 10.1162/108819803323059442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that switchgrass uses 0.8 GJ/ODT of fossil energy compared to grain corn's 2.9 GJ/ODT.&lt;ref name="Samson, R. et al. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samson | first1 = R. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = The Potential of C4 Perennial Grasses for Developing a Global BIOHEAT Industry | url = http://www.reap-canada.com/online_library/feedstock_biomass/15-The%20Potential%20of%20C4%20Perennial%20Grasses%20for%20Developing...%20_Samson%20et%20al.,%202005_.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Critical Reviews in Plant Science | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 461–495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that switchgrass contains approximately 18.8 GJ/ODT of biomass, the energy output-to-input ratio for the crop can be up to 20:1.&lt;ref name="Samson, R. et al. 2008"&gt;Samson, R. et al.

Pimental. (Ed.)  Springer Science, Berlin, Germany. 2008. 395-423.&lt;/ref&gt;  This highly favorable ratio is attributable to its relatively high energy output per hectare and low energy inputs for production.

Considerable effort is being expended in developing switchgrass as a [[cellulosic ethanol]] crop in the USA.  In [[George W. Bush's 2006 State of the Union Address]], he proposed using switchgrass for ethanol;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Business/story?id=1566784|title=Switchgrass: The Super Plant Savior?|author=Adrienne Mand Lewin|date=2006-02-01|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5183608|title=Switch Grass: Alternative Energy Source?|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=2006-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush has plan to end oil 'addiction'|date=2006-02-01|url= http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/01/31/bush.sotu/|author1=Dana Bash |author2=Suzanne Malveaux |publisher=CNN|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; since then, over [[US$]]100 million has been invested into researching switchgrass as a potential biofuel source.&lt;ref&gt;"Since that mention in the 2006, investment in switch grass has exploded, thanks in large part, experts say, to the President's speech.

Ethanol Can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals. Science. Volume
311. 2006. 506-508.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of using switchgrass over corn as an ethanol feedstock is its cost of production is generally about 1/2 that of grain corn, and more biomass energy per hectare can be captured in the field.&lt;ref name="Samson, R. et al. 2008"/&gt;  Thus, switchgrass cellulosic ethanol should give a higher [[Crop yield|yield]] of ethanol per hectare at lower cost.  However, this will depend on whether the cost of constructing and operating cellulosic ethanol plants can be reduced considerably.  The switchgrass ethanol industry [[energy returned on energy invested|energy balance]] is also considered to be substantially better than that of [[corn ethanol]].  During the [[bioconversion]] process, the [[lignin]] fraction of switchgrass can be burned to provide sufficient [[steam]] and [[electricity]] to operate the [[biorefinery]].  Studies have found that for every unit of energy input needed to create a biofuel from switchgrass, four [[units of energy]] are yielded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5183608|title=Switch Grass: Alternative Energy Source?|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, corn ethanol yields about 1.28 units of energy per unit of energy input.&lt;ref name="Wang et al. 2007"&gt;Wang, M., Wu, M., &amp; Huo, H.

However, there remain [[commercialization]] barriers to the development of cellulosic ethanol technology.

The commercialization of cellulosic ethanol is thus proving to be a significant challenge, despite noteworthy research efforts.[[File:PanicumVirgatum.jpg|thumb|right]]

Thermal energy applications for switchgrass appear to be closer to near-term scale-up than cellulosic ethanol for industrial or small-scale applications.  For example, switchgrass can be [[pellet mill|pressed into fuel pellets]] that are subsequently burned in [[pellet stoves]] used to heat homes (which typically burn corn or [[wood pellet]]s).&lt;ref name="samson_2007"&gt;{{cite web

Switchgrass pellets were identified to have a 14.6:1 energy output-to-input ratio, which is substantially better than that for liquid biofuel options from farmland.&lt;ref name="Samson, R. et al. 2005"/&gt;  As a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy, switchgrass pellets were found to be an effective means to use farmland to mitigate greenhouse gases on the order of 7.6-13 tonnes per hectare of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  In contrast, switchgrass cellulosic ethanol and corn ethanol were found to mitigate 5.2 and 1.5 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per hectare, respectively.&lt;ref name="Samson et al., 2008"/&gt;

Historically, the major constraint to the development of grasses for thermal energy applications has been the difficulty associated with burning grasses in conventional [[boilers]], as biomass quality problems can be of particular concern in combustion applications.  These technical problems now appear to have been largely resolved through crop management practices such as fall [[mowing]] and spring [[harvesting]] that allow for [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] to occur, which leads to fewer [[aerosol]]-forming compounds (such as K and Cl) and N in the grass.  This reduces [[clinker (waste)|clinker]] formation and [[corrosion]], and enables switchgrass to be a clean combustion fuel source for use in smaller combustion appliances.  Fall harvested grasses likely have more application for larger commercial and industrial boilers.&lt;ref&gt;"Samson et al. 2007":

Bai et al. (2010) conducted a study to analyze the environmental sustainability of using switchgrass plant material as a feedstock for [[ethanol]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Bai, Y., Luo, L, &amp; van der Voe, E.  (2010). Life cycle assessment of switchgrass-derived ethanol as transport fuel. Int J Life Cycle Assess. 15 (15), 468-477. This can be found on-line at: http://www.springerlink.com/content/ap35w2q46420tn4x/fulltext.pdf. {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Life cycle analysis]] was used to make this assessment.  They compared efficiency of [[E10 fuel|E10]], [[E85]], and ethanol with [[gasoline]].  They took into account air and water emissions associated with growing, managing, processing and storing the switchgrass crop.  They also factored in the transportation of the stored switchgrass to the ethanol plant where they assumed the distance was 20&amp;nbsp;km.  The reductions in [[global warming]] potential by using E10 and E85 were 5 and 65%, respectively.   Their models also suggested that the “human toxicity potential” and “eco-toxicity potential” were substantially greater for the high ethanol fuels (i.e., E85 and ethanol) than for gasoline and E10.

In 2014, a genetically altered form of the bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii was created which can cheaply and efficiently turn switchgrass into ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-take-plants-biofuel-one-step |title=Bacteria take plants to biofuel in one step |publisher=Science News |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/05/29/1402210111.abstract |title=Direct conversion of plant biomass to ethanol by engineered Caldicellulosiruptor bescii |accessdate=2014-06-04 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1402210111 |volume=111 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |pages=8931–8936|pmc=4066518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biodegradable plastics production ===
In a novel application, US scientists have genetically modified switchgrass to enable it to produce [[polyhydroxybutyrate]], which accumulates in beadlike granules within the plant's cells.&lt;ref&gt;''Biomass Combo'', [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]], '''86''', 33, 18 Aug. 2008, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In preliminary tests, the dry weight of a plants leaves were shown to comprise up to 3.7% of the polymer.&lt;ref&gt;''Plant Biotechnology Journal'', '''2008''', 6, 663&lt;/ref&gt;  Such low accumulation rates do not, as of 2009, allow for commercial use of switchgrass as a biosource.

=== Soil conservation ===
{{further information|Mine reclamation|Restoration ecology|Revegetation}}
Switchgrass is useful for [[soil conservation]] and [[soil amendment|amendment]], particularly in the United States and Canada, where switchgrass is endemic. Switchgrass has a deep fibrous root system – nearly as deep as the plant is tall.  Since it, along with other native grasses and [[forb]]s, once covered the plains of the United States that are now the [[Corn Belt]], the effects of the past switchgrass habitat have been beneficial, lending to the fertile farmland that exists today.  The deep fibrous root systems of switchgrass left a deep rich layer of [[organic matter]] in the soils of the Midwest, making those [[mollisol]] soils some of the most productive in the world.  By returning switchgrass and other perennial prairie grasses as an agricultural crop, many marginal soils may benefit from increased levels of organic material, permeability, and fertility, due to the grass's deep root system.

Soil [[erosion]], both from wind and water, is of great concern in regions where switchgrass grows. Due to its height, switchgrass can form an effective wind erosion barrier.&lt;ref name="plant_fact_sheet_NRCS"&gt;{{cite web

|date=2006-05-06
|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its root system, also, is excellent for holding soil in place, which helps prevent erosion from flooding and runoff.
Some [[Department of Transportation|highway departments]] (for example, [[Kansas Department of Transportation|KDOT]]) have used switchgrass in their seed mixes when re-establishing growth along roadways.&lt;ref name="kdot_bids"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used on [[strip mine]] sites, dikes,&lt;ref name="plant_fact_sheet_NRCS"/&gt; and pond dams. [[Conservation district]]s in many parts of the United States use it to control erosion  in grass waterways because of its ability to anchor soils while providing habitat for wildlife.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; through chemical compounds known as [[saponins]], which cause [[photosensitivity]] and liver damage in these animals.  Researchers are continuing to learn more about the specific conditions under which switchgrass causes harm to these species, but until more is discovered, it is recommended switchgrass not be fed to them. For cattle, however, it can be fed as hay, or grazed.

Grazing switchgrass calls for watchful management practices to ensure survival of the stand.  It is recommended that grazing begin when the plants are about 50&amp;nbsp;cm tall, and that grazing be discontinued when the plants have been eaten down to about 25&amp;nbsp;cm, and to rest the pasture 30 – 45 days between grazing periods.&lt;ref name="ball_2006_table_28"&gt;{{Cite book

=== Game cover ===
Switchgrass is well-known among wildlife conservationists as good forage and habitat for upland [[game bird]] species, such as [[pheasant]], [[quail]], [[grouse]], and [[wild turkey]], and [[songbird|song birds]], with its plentiful small seeds and tall cover. A study published in 2015 has shown that switchgrass, when grown in a traditional monoculture, has an adverse impact on some wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leimbach | first1 = D.D. | last2 = Marcello | first2 = G.J. | year = 2015 | title = Observed effects of warm season perennial grass agriculture on resident mammal species | url = | journal = Sustainable Agriculture Research | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 70–77 | doi=10.5539/sar.v4n2p70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on how thickly switchgrass is planted, and what it is partnered with, it also offers excellent forage and cover for other wildlife across the country. For those producers who have switchgrass stands on their farm, it is considered an environmental and aesthetic benefit due to the abundance of wildlife attracted by the switchgrass stands. Some members of Prairie Lands Bio-Products, Inc. in Iowa have even turned this benefit into a profitable business by leasing their switchgrass land for hunting during the proper seasons.&lt;ref name="hipple_2002"&gt;{{cite conference

A '''pencil detonator''' or '''time pencil''' is a time [[fuze]] designed to be connected to a [[detonator]] or short length of [[fuse (explosives)|safety fuse]]. They are about the same size and shape as a [[pencil]], hence the name. They were introduced during [[World War II]].

== Types ==

=== Number Ten delay switch ===
[[File:Time pencil.svg|thumb|upright=1.4]]
One type, the [[UK|British]] Number Ten Delay Switch (official name, "Switch, No. 10, Delay" and often referred to as a "timing pencil"), was made of a [[brass]] (or in later versions [[aluminium]]) tube, with a [[copper]] section at one end which contained a glass [[vial]] of [[Copper(II) chloride|cupric chloride]] (the liquid was widely and erroneously reported to be [[sulfuric acid]]{{or|date=April 2017}}), while beneath the vial was a spring-loaded [[Firing pin|striker]] under tension and held in place by a thin metal wire. The timer was started by crushing the copper section of the tube to break the vial of cupric chloride, which then began to slowly erode the wire holding back the striker. When the wire eventually parted, the striker was propelled down the hollow centre of the detonator, hitting the [[percussion cap]] at the other end of the detonator.

Number ten delay switches had delays ranging from 10 minutes to 24 hours and were accurate to within [[plus or minus]] two or three minutes in an hour's delay, and plus or minus an hour in a 12-hour delay, though environmental conditions could affect this. The switches were typically issued in packs of five, all the switches in a pack having the same delay. In use, two switches with the same delay (from different packs if possible) would be placed in the explosive charge in case one switch failed.

;Using a No. 10 delay switch:
{{quote|"Crush the end of the thin [[copper]] tube containing the cupric chloride with [[pliers]], or under the heel of your boot. There is no need to crush the end of the tube completely flat. All that is required is to crush and dent the tube sufficiently to break the glass vial, thereby releasing the liquid contained within. Check the inspection hole next to the brass safety strip. If the inspection hole is unobstructed (i.e. it is possible to see right through to the other side) then the countdown has started and the brass safety strip (holding back the striker) should be removed and discarded. However, if the inspection hole is obstructed (before the safety strip is removed) the striker has been released so the pencil detonator should be discarded and another one selected. The final step is to insert the end of the pencil which has the actual [[detonator]] fitted into the explosives and leave the area."}}

===  L-Delay ("No. 9 delay switch") ===
Another, superior type, was developed by [[Millis Jefferis]] of [[MD1]] known as the "Lead Delay switch" or officially "Switch, No. 9, L Delay". Instead of relying on the action of acid on metal (which was subject to temperature variation), it used a piece of metal under stress - the metal in question being a [[lead]] alloy that was extremely affected by mechanical [[creep (deformation)|creep]]. A piece of this lead was notched to a set diameter, the diameter setting the time delay. When the starting pin was removed, this wire was placed under tension by the spring-loaded striker, and began to gradually stretch. After certain time it would snap at the notch and allow the striker to hit the percussion cap.

The delay could be set from a matter of minutes to hours. Manufacture was entirely by MD1.&lt;ref&gt;Macrae, ''Churchill's Toyshop''&lt;/ref&gt; 
Generally speaking L-delays were slightly less reliable{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and had shorter delays, but were more reliable underwater (if a No. 10 fuze developed a leak, water would dilute the corrosive liquid and increase the delay or stop the fuze from working).

=== Percussion igniter ===
Another type of time pencil had a percussion cap but no detonator attached. Instead there was a crimping attachment at one end to allow pyrotechnic fuse to be crimped on. When a time pencil of this type fired, it would light the fuse which would burn towards a detonator crimped onto the other end. Because standard [[Fuse (explosives)#Fuses|safety fuse]] burns at around half a metre per minute, it is not practicable to provide delays of more than a few minutes in this way. It was also possible to connect a pencil detonator to so-called "instantaneous fuse" (not to be confused with [[detonating cord]]) which had an unusually fast burn rate of over 7 metres per second.

== Characteristics ==
Pencil detonators are colour-coded to indicate the ''nominal'' time delay, which can range from 10 minutes through to 24 hours. No. 10 delays were normally issued in a tin of 5, all of the same delay, while L-delays were issued in a larger tin which included a mixture of different delays to suit a variety of operations. The time delay of a No. 10 varies according to the [[concentration]] of the corrosive liquid in the vial. It is widely reported that the wire thickness varied also, but in fact all used the same diameter of wire. The time delay of a No. 9 is determined solely by the thickness of the notch in the wire, the [[spring (device)|spring]] [[tension (mechanics)|tension]], and the [[temperature]]. Pencil detonators could be used with any explosive provided a suitable [[Explosive booster|booster]] was attached. However, [[plastic explosive]]s (which did not require a booster) were particularly useful during the sabotage missions in which they were often employed. There were also a number of special charges issued with a time pencil already incorporated e.g. some types of [[limpet mines]].

After being activated a pencil detonator is silent in operation. It does not fizz or make any other noise. However, unlike [[clockwork]] timers, pencil detonators only give approximate time delays. For example, a 2-hour pencil detonator might be accurate to [[plus or minus]] 5 minutes, whereas the version offering a 6-hour delay could have a [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] of plus or minus 15 minutes. Both No. 9 and No. 10 delays were also significantly affected by the ambient temperature, and were issued along with a chart of temperature corrections&amp;mdash;but no [[thermometer]]. For example, a pencil detonator designed to fire 24 hours after being activated could in reality give a 30-hour delay - if the weather was very cold. Similarly, during hot weather pencil detonators designed to fire after a 12-hour delay could in reality trigger detonation within 10 hours. The main virtue of pencil detonators is their small size and light weight, plus the fact that they are very quick and easy to use. These are important points during covert operations.

== Usage ==
For very high-value targets it is recommended that two pencil detonators from different batches be used together. That way if one detonator fails the other will almost surely blow the charge. Note that if both detonators were going to work, the explosion will occur at the minimum of the two times; thus this method will also slightly reduce the average delay.

Pencil detonators saw heavy use during the [[Second World War]] by the [[Special Air Service]], [[Special Operations Executive]] and groups such as the [[French Resistance]]. A number of pencil detonators were used to detonate the massive [[amatol]] charge hidden inside [[HMS Campbeltown (I42)|HMS ''Campbeltown'']] during the [[St. Nazaire Raid|St Nazaire Raid]] of 1942. The ship exploded over an hour later than anticipated.

Approximately 12 million pencil detonators were produced in Britain during the war. However, in recent years they have been superseded by electronic timers which are more accurate and provide much longer delay times. Since pencil detonators are, unlike electronic timers, completely immune to detection or jamming via [[electronic countermeasures]] or [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]s, they may still have applicability in special situations.

[[File:Chemischer.Bleistift.Zeitzuender.jpg|thumb|Pencil detonator used in the July 20 plot in 1944 exhibitied in [[Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr]] in Dresden (Germany)]]

The briefcase bomb used in the [[July 20 plot]] used a captured British pencil detonator inserted into a block of British plastic explosives weighing approximately two pounds. The bomb was set to 30 minutes and detonated as planned, but [[Hitler]] survived with minor injuries. [[Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg|Stauffenberg]] could not prepare the second block, though. He got rid of it while driving through the forest to the airfield. His driver, Leutnant Erich Kretz, reported seeing [[Werner von Haeften]] throw something into the woods in his mirror.[http://www.filmreporter.de/?cat=1&amp;cnc_id=19736]

The '''Prague pneumatic post''' (Czech: Pražská potrubní pošta) is the world's last preserved [[city|municipal]] [[Pneumatic tube|pneumatic post]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Wertheim, Margaret. [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16422095.000-bones-to-phones.html Bones to phones], ''[[New Scientist]]'' October 23, 1999; Volume 164; Issue 2209; Section: Features; Page 40&lt;/ref&gt; It is an underground system of metal tubes under the wider centre of [[Prague]], totaling about {{convert|55|km|mi}} in length.&lt;ref name="service"&gt;Lazarová, Daniela.

== History ==
The [[Prague]] pneumatic post entered public service on March 4, 1889.&lt;ref name="idnes" /&gt; The first lane had been constructed as early as 1887, but at first it only served internal purposes. It ran from the main [[post office]] in Jindřišská st. (next to the [[Wenceslas Square]]) to the post bureau at Malé náměstí square (next to the [[Old Town Square]]) in the [[Old Town (Prague)|Old Town]]. (This bureau was situated in a corner house with Linhartská st., belonging to the [[V. J. Rott]] company, next to a house that is called 'U Rotta' today.) The first lane was later extended as far as the [[Prague Castle]], making it over 5&amp;nbsp;km long. Prague was the fifth city in the world to receive a pneumatic post system after [[London Pneumatic Despatch Company|London]], [[Vienna]], [[Berlin]], and [[Paris]], which was considered a major achievement for Prague.&lt;ref name="service"/&gt;

The system initially was employed mainly for sending [[telegraphy|telegrams]]. Only three stations had been connected between the Prague [[mail|post]] and the telegraph office as of 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Wentworth. (1901) [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Sessional Papers. (1902) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6HlEAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA7-PA6&amp;dq=Prague+pneumatic+post#PRA7-PA3,M1 Report on the trade of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] for 1901]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was established for those desiring to send a document quickly. The document would be taken to the post office and rolled up into a metal capsule. The clerk would then drop the metal capsule down a hatch leading to a predestined location. After the clerk pressed a button, the capsule would be moved by compressed air along a network of tubes beneath the pavement.&lt;ref name="service"/&gt;

The main growth of the network dates to the economically prosperous era of 1927–1932. In those years, new lanes were constructed and tens of thousands of capsules transported per month. During the [[Prague Uprising]] the pneumatic post played a role in supplying the besieged building of the [[Český rozhlas|Czech radio]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In the late 1990s, the system was used by over 20 subscribers and operating at a loss, so kept rather for prestigious reasons. The traffic weakened gradually and the 2002 floods seriously damaged it, flooding 5 of the 11 underground engine rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobil.idnes.cz/mob_tech.asp?c=A040517_5258397_mob_prakticky Potrubní pošta - technický unikát pod ulicemi Prahy], ''iDNES'' 17 May 2004 {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ovladací-panel.jpg|thumb|upright|Air-pump control panel, with an [[ammeter]] and a [[manometer]] set in a marble slab]]

== Pipes ==

The lanes consist of [[steel]] pipes of 65&amp;nbsp;mm [[caliber|bore]] and wall thickness of 2.5–3&amp;nbsp;mm. The pipes are connected with tight couplers 14&amp;nbsp;cm long to ensure perfect coaxial alignment and then welded together, ensuring air-tightness. To prevent [[stray voltage]] from causing excess [[corrosion]], ceramic [[Insulator (electrical)|insulators]] are inserted between the pipe segments at some places. Pipes buried underground are protected from the outside by a layer of [[fiberglass]], wound around at increased temperature and coated with hot [[asphalt]]. The pipeline is typically buried under the Prague [[sidewalk]]s 80–120&amp;nbsp;cm deep. Inside buildings and in the Prague [[trunk conduit network]] the pipes simply are coated with anti-corrosive paint.

The minimum [[bend radius]] is 250&amp;nbsp;cm for underground pipes, but 300&amp;nbsp;cm is the most commonly used radius. Inside buildings a bend radius as low as 200&amp;nbsp;cm is allowed. The bends are made of special [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] pipes at normal temperature, using a custom-made bender.

A signaling cable is laid along with the pipe, enabling communication with the track components.

The lane segments are equipped with [[dumb well]]s, where the pipeline can be opened and inspected, or a stuck capsule removed. For this purpose a heavier capsule can be sent at a pressure of up to 30 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], knocking the stuck capsule out.

== Transport capsule ==
[[Image:Pouzdra-pro-zásilky.jpg|thumb|left|A capsule for transporting packages using the Prague pneumatic post network]]
The system uses [[aluminium]] capsules measuring 48&amp;nbsp;mm in outer-diameter and 200&amp;nbsp;mm in length. On the rear end they are fitted with a plastic circlet, preventing [[friction]] against walls of the pipe and a soft plastic skirt, sealing air behind the capsule. The diameter of the rear circlet is 57&amp;nbsp;mm. The remaining 8 millimeters of the bore are sealed just by the skirt, allowing for excellent airtightness and low friction at the same time.

== Propulsion units ==
[[Image:strojovna-se-dmychadly.jpg|thumb|Engine room in the main post office building in Jindřišská St. at {{coord|50|5|0.04|N|14|25|40.6|E|region:CZ_type:landmark_scale:1000|name=Main Post office building}}]]
[[Image:Dmychadlo-ze-30-let.jpg|thumb|Original bladed air pump from the 1930s]]
Each lane is equipped with a dedicated propulsion unit, consisting of an [[electric motor|electrically]]-powered air [[pump]]. One pump can service at most 3 kilometers of pipeline, so it's necessary to use several pumps on longer lanes.

The pumps must be [[Reversing (Vehicle maneuver)|reversible]], creating either [[pressure]] or [[vacuum]]. The pumps are connected to the pipes with [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Tee|tee-fittings]]. On both sides of the tee the pipe is equipped with switches activated by a passing capsule.

At first the pump is set to intake mode, pulling the capsule towards the tee. Before reaching it, the capsule hits the first switch, causing the pump to start reversing. Meanwhile, the capsule reaches the tee-fitting. As it passes the tee, the pump is already fully reversed and starts to push the capsule away.

The older pumps were bladed, having a single [[blade]], mounted eccentrically inside a 300&amp;nbsp;mm high cylinder. More recent pumps employ a rotating [[piston]] instead.

== Packages ==

The capsules can be loaded with packages up to 5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and 30&amp;nbsp;cm in length. Their weight can be up to 3&amp;nbsp;kg. Generally these were rolled-up telegrams, but any package within the set limits could be transported.

For obvious reasons, dangerous and [[corrosive substance]]s, which could damage the pipeline, were banned. On the other hand, the travel speed could be adjusted, allowing for transporting fragile packages.

== Lanes and stations ==
[[Image:vstup-trasy.jpg|thumb|upright|Lane input hatch, where the capsules were inserted]]

The Prague pneumatic post network consists of five main lanes arranged in a [[Star network|star topology]], fitted with [[Railroad switch|switches]] and [[concentrator]]s, and of ''subscriber's lines''. The total length of the lanes is about 55 kilometers. Some of the most frequented segments have two pipes (one for each direction), but the majority of the lanes use a single pipe and the direction is determined by setting up the pumps to run in the desired direction. The main lanes connect the following post offices and bureaus:

* Jindřišská st. – Prague 2, Prague 3, Prague 10
* Jindřišská st. – Prague 1, Prague 2
* Jindřišská st. – Prague 5
* Jindřišská st. – Prague 6
* Jindřišská st. – Prague 7

Originally there were 16 subscriber's lines, but only 7 have been preserved up till today. A total of 24 pneumatic post stations remain today.

The network crosses the river [[Vltava]] in three spots making use of bridges ([[Hlávkův most]], [[Mánesův most]], [[most Legií]]).

== The headquarters/switchboard ==
[[Image:hlavy-tras.jpg|thumb|left|Controllers of the five main lanes with counters, indicator lights and switch controls]]
All the lanes converge to the ''main post office'' in Jindřišská St. Here all the packages were carefully recorded and from here the network was controlled and monitored. This is also the place where the packages were forwarded from one lane to another. The capsule was picked up from a receiving pocket by a member of the staff, recorded and inserted into the inlet of another lane.

The current lane state was indicated by indicator lights on the lane's controller. Up to 10 packages in 30-second intervals could be sent on the same lane at once, although this was rarely used in practice.

When sending capsules to '''switched lanes''', the capsules had to be sent out in a predefined order, as the switches could only be activated before commencing the transfer. The first capsule would be diverted, after which the switch would automatically slide back to its neutral position, sending the remaining capsules in the straight direction. Therefore, the capsule that was meant to branch off had to be sent first.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7203">The '''Recreational Software Advisory Council''' ('''RSAC''') was an independent, non-profit organization founded in the U.S. in 1994 by the [[Software Publishers Association]] as well as six other industry leaders in response to [[video game controversy]] and threats of government regulation.

The goal of the council was to provide objective content ratings for [[computer game]]s, similar to the earlier formed [[Videogame Rating Council]] (VRC) and later [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB). The RSAC ratings were based on the research of Dr. [[Donald F. Roberts]] of [[Stanford University]] who studied media and its effect on children.

In 1993, senators [[Herb Kohl]] and [[Joseph Lieberman]] raised concerns over the levels of violence and other adult material appearing in video games which were available to children.  Under threat of government regulation, industry groups like the Software Publishers Association (SPA), the [[Association of Shareware Professionals]] (ASP), and others had concerns about the intrusion of the government, and the costs, delays and subjective judgements of a review-committee-based system.

At the time, the largest trade group, the SPA had few members in the gaming field, but the ASP had many, and the two organizations decided to work together. Mark Traphagen (an attorney with the SPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Report 104-27 ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-104srpt27/html/CRPT-104srpt27.htm|website=U.S. Government Publishing Office|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office|accessdate=28 April 2018|date=4 April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rosemary West (ASP board member) appeared before Congress in the summer of 1994 in support of the SPA representation.

The SPA and ASP (and other industry groups) were opposed to an age-based rating system operated by a review committee as developed by the ESRB, which was proposed by several multi-national console game manufacturers and distributors.  The groups preferred a content labeling system that would allow parents to know what was in the games and then make their own judgements about what their children would see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=More Game Ratings|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=86|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=November 1995|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ASP-sponsored committee, led by Jim Green of Software Testing Labs, and staffed by Karen Crowther of Redwood Games, and Randy MacLean of FormGen, developed the initial version of what would become the RSAC ratings. The committee identified the elements most likely to be of concern to parents and developed specific descriptions of the levels of such content that would define the levels reported. The system would be self-administered by game publishers who could use the system to label their games.

The entire system was turned over to the SPA for its newly formed Recreational Software Advisory Council in 1994. The council formed RSACi in 1995, which was a branch which rated websites.

The organization was closed in 1999 and reformed into the [[Internet Content Rating Association]] (ICRA). The background, formation and rating process of the RSAC and RSACi may be viewed [https://web.archive.org/web/19970414061624/http://www.rsac.org/talk/balkam1.html here].

'''''Service à la russe''''' ([[French language|French]], "service in the Russian style") is a manner of dining that involves courses being brought to the table sequentially. It contrasts with ''[[service à la française]]'' ("service in the French style") in which all the food is brought out at once, in an impressive display.

Russian Ambassador [[Alexander Kurakin]] is credited with bringing ''service à la russe'' to [[France]] in the early 19th century. It later caught on in [[England]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} and is now the style in which most modern [[Western cuisine|Western]] [[restaurant]]s serve food (with some significant modifications).

==Place setting and service order==
[[File:Formal Place Setting.jpg|thumb|''Service à la russe'' 8 course place setting for one person]] 
For the most correct ''service à la russe'', the following must be observed:

The place setting (called a cover) for each guest includes a [[Charger (table setting)|service plate]], all the necessary [[cutlery]] except those required for dessert, and stemmed glasses for water, [[wine]]s and [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]. Atop the service plate is a rolled napkin, and atop that is the [[place card]]. Above the plate is a [[saltcellar]], nut dish, and a [[menu]].

The cutlery to the right of the service plate is, from the outside in, the [[oyster fork]] resting in the bowl of the [[soup spoon]], the [[fish knife]], the [[meat knife]] and the [[salad knife]] (or [[fruit knife]]). On the left, from the outside in, are the [[fish fork]], the [[meat fork]] and a [[salad fork]] (or [[fruit fork]]). If both a salad and a fruit course are served, the necessary extra flatware is brought out on a platter, as it is bad form to have more than three knives or forks on the table at once, the oyster fork excepted.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Guests are seated according to their place cards and immediately remove their napkins and place them in their laps. Another view maintains that the napkin is only removed after the host has removed his or hers. (In the same manner, the host is first to begin eating, and guests follow.) The [[oyster plate]] is placed atop the service plate. Once that is cleared, the soup plate replaces it. After the soup course is finished, both the soup plate and service plate are removed from the table, and a heated plate is put in their place. The rule is as such: a filled plate is always replaced with an empty one, and no place goes without a plate until just before the dessert course.

The fish and meat courses are always served from [[platter (dishware)|platter]]s because in correct service a filled plate is never placed before a guest, as this would indirectly dictate how much food the guest is to eat.

Directly before dessert, everything is removed from the place settings except the wine and water glasses. Crumbs are cleared. The dessert plate is then brought out with a [[doily]] on top of it, a [[finger bowl]] on top of that, and a fork and spoon, the former balanced on the left side of the plate and the latter on the right. Guests remove the doily and finger bowls, move them to the left of the plate and place the fork to the left side of the plate and the spoon to its right. Guests do not actually need to use the finger bowl, since they may have not used their fingers to eat with, unless they also had bread with the meal.

==A multi-course dinner served ''à la russe''==
The number of dishes (or courses) served at a meal ''à la russe'' has changed over time; but an underlying pattern of service—beginning with soup, then moving through various entrées, then to the roast or game, and then to vegetables (including salads), sweets and coffee—persisted from the mid-19th century (when this type of service was introduced into France) up to the Second World War, and continued in a much-reduced form into the 21st century.  The order of dishes descends directly from the much older ''[[service à la française]]''.  In that style of service, all sorts of dishes were arranged on the table and guests served themselves and each other; but as [[Jean-Louis Flandrin]] has shown, the order of ''consumption''—known to the guests of the time but rarely evident from contemporary menus or descriptions of meals—was essentially the same as the order of ''presentation'' in ''service à la russe''.&lt;ref name="Flandrin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flandrin|first=Jean-Louis|title=Arranging the Meal: A History of Table Service in France (California Studies in Food and Culture)|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|date=2007|isbn=978-0520238855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most elaborate version of ''service à  la russe'', which reached its pinnacle in the last decades of the Victorian era, was described by [[Sarah Tyson Rorer]] in 1886.  Rorer was critical of this elaborate service and offered a much simpler alternative, which in fact represents the core principals of this style of service.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The elaborate and conventional dinner, complete at all points, which the dinner-giving of a century and a half has evolved, is beyond any but the very wealthy.  Very few of them succeed in giving it, and still fewer of their guests enjoy it.  Its triple triplets of oysters, soup, and fish, the relevé, entrées, and roast, a pause of rum punch to stimulate languishing digestion, game with salad, sweets and ice, coffee to close, and a bewildering series of wines, with an alcoholic appetizer to begin and end, have, however, had their effect in making many feel that a formal dinner must only follow this model from afar.  So, with only the resources of a simple household, they compass, with infinite labor, oysters, soup, and fish, add some made dish to the meat, and put salad before and ice cream after the pudding or sweets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But success here, with a moderate income, is as rare as success with the long dinner at the complete table.  Try to grasp the theory of the elaborate edifice which custom and convention has piled up, and see if your own resources cannot reproduce its purpose with better success.  After having carefully analyzed it, you will see at once that the most complex dinner simply aims to begin with something of easy digestion, slide by some transition to the roast, and make sure that through salad, sweets and coffee, the last half of your dinner shall interest the appetite as well as satisfy hunger.  You, have, therefore, soup, roast, dessert, which make up the usual dinner of thoroughly civilized people, and below you will see how, with but moderate resources, you may so vary this as to make a “little dinner” complete and satisfying in itself; more, the most elaborate meal at Delmonico’s cannot do.&lt;ref name="Rorer"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mrsrorersphilade00rorerich |last=Rorer|first=Sarah Tyson|title=Mrs. Rorer's Philadelphia Cookbook |location= Philadelphia|publisher=Arnold and Company |year=1886 |accessdate=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|247-248}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Britain and the United States, fish is a distinct course; relevés are large, solid joints of meat or whole fowl, generally baked, braised, or boiled but not roasted; entrées are elaborate "made dishes" of, typically, fillets of beef or other butcher's meat (and sometimes fowl, but—apart from days of religious observance—not fish), served in fine sauces.  Roasts are solid joints of meat (and sometimes fowl) other than feathered game, usually spit-roasted but often baked.  Game is feathered not furred, spit-roasted whole and served rather simply.&lt;ref name="Ranhofer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}  (Rorer's "roast" here refers to a roasted entrée, but this terminology is not typical of the period.  In her time, the "roast" followed the punch, and it was always game, if available.) 

At the time Rorer was writing, [[Alessandro Filippini]], a chef at [[Delmonico's]] restaurant on Pine Street in New York, wrote a book of menus for "every family of means in the habit of giving a few dinners to its friends during the year", with a brief discussion of table service and a guide to wines.  He recommended the types of menus criticized by Rorer but common among the wealthy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;French dinners are generally served in three main courses, viz., Relevés, Entrées, and Rotis; all the rest are considered side courses.  It depends entirely on the taste of the host as to how many main courses he desires served.  The author would suggest two relevés, three entrées, and one or two rotis; this could be made an elaborate dinner.&lt;ref name="Filippini"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yzgEAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last=Filippini|first=Alessandro|title=The Table: How to Buy Food, How to Cook It, How to Serve It|location=New York|publisher=Charles L. Webster &amp; Company |year=1889|accessdate=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About a third of Filippini's book contains menus for breakfast, luncheon, and dinner for every day of the year.  The dinner menus begin with the "side courses", as he calls them: oysters or clams, soup, and hors d'œuvre; followed by the three "main courses": several relevés and entrées, and one roti (roast); and finally a few other "side courses": sweet entremets, ices, and coffee.

Hors-d'œuvre are usually little cold items (such as olives, celery, radishes, charcuterie, caviar), but they might also include hot made dishes (such as timbales, croustades, croquettes).  In the French style of ''service à la russe'', used by Filippini for many of his menus, there is no distinct "fish course", as both relevés and entrées may be of meat, fowl, or fish indiscriminately. Punch often precedes the roast.  The roast can be of meat, fowl, or fish (though fish is generally limited to days of religious observance); but when game is served, it always makes up the roast course.  Entremets are the vegetables, including salads, served with the relevés and entrées; they not as a separate course, though they are often listed as such.  Sweet entremets are cakes, puddings, and such.  Ices are frozen sweets, served as a separate course.  Fruit, petits fours, coffee, and cordials are offered at the end of the meal.&lt;ref name="Ranhofer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25-150}}  

A few years after Filippini wrote his book, [[Charles Ranhofer]], another chef at [[Delmonico's]] restaurant (variously at the 14th Street, 26th Street, and 44th Street locations), in his cookbook ''The Epicurean'', outlined in great detail the dishes necessary for dinners ranging from six to fourteen courses.  The six-course dinner is very much like Rorer's "little dinner": oysters, soup, fish, entrée, roast, salad, and dessert.  Longer dinners are arranged by adding side dishes, removes, and various cold dishes, and by serving a greater number of entrées and desserts.  The longest of these menus is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Figure 1—36 covers:&lt;br/&gt;
# Oysters.&lt;br/&gt;
# 2 Soups.&lt;br/&gt;
# S.D. hot and cold.&lt;br/&gt;
# 2 Fish, potatoes.&lt;br/&gt;
# 1 Remove, vegetables.&lt;br/&gt;
# 1 Entrée, vegetables.&lt;br/&gt;
# 1 Entrée, vegetables.&lt;br/&gt;
# 1 Entrée, vegetables.&lt;br/&gt;
# 1 Punch.&lt;br/&gt;
# 1 or 2 Roasts.&lt;br/&gt;
# 1 or 2 Colds, salad.&lt;br/&gt;
# 1 Hot sweet dessert.&lt;br/&gt;
# 1 or 2 Cold sweet des'rts.&lt;br/&gt;
# 1 or 2 Ices.  Dessert.&lt;ref name="Ranhofer"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/epicureancomplet00ranhrich|last=Ranhofer|first=Charles|title=The Epicurean|location=New York|publisher=Charles Ranhofer |year=1894|accessdate=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"S.D." are "side dishes", i.e. hors d'œuvre.  There is a separate fish course, then relevés and entrées.  Cold dishes, such as mayonnaise salads and aspics, had become very popular at this time, as is evident in the menu.  Roasts could be of butchers' meat, fowl, or game (rarely, if ever, of fish).  When more than one dish was appointed for a course (e.g. 2 Soups, 2 Fish, 2 roasts, 2 colds), the guest was expected to choose one or the other, not both; a guest might also decline one or more of the courses.

Ranhofer also gives elaborate instructions for the service of wine.

Several decades later, shorter meals had become the norm and the extravagant dinners of the Victorian period were considered vulgar, as noted by [[Emily Post]] in 1922: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under no circumstances would a private dinner, no matter how formal, consist of more than:&lt;br/&gt;
# Hors-d’œuvre&lt;br/&gt;
# Soup&lt;br/&gt;
# Fish&lt;br/&gt;
# Entrée&lt;br/&gt;
# Roast&lt;br/&gt;
# Salad&lt;br/&gt;
# Dessert&lt;br/&gt;
# Coffee&lt;br/&gt;
The menu for an informal dinner would leave out the entrée, and possibly either the hors-d’oeuvre or the soup.

As a matter of fact, the marked shortening of the menu is in informal dinners and at the home table of the well-to-do.  Formal dinners have been as short as the above schedule for twenty-five years.  [c.1900.] A dinner interlarded with a row of extra entrées, Roman punch, and hot dessert is unknown except at a public dinner, or in the dining-room of a parvenu.  About thirty-five years ago [c.1890] such dinners are said to have been in fashion!&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314 |last=Post|first=Emily|title=Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics, and at Home|location=New York|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company |year=1922 |accessdate=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119-120}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the time Post was writing, hors-d’œuvre meant rather narrowly light cold dishes like oysters, clams, melon, or citrus.  Entrées meant elaborate "made dishes" of fillets of beef or other butcher's meat served in a fine sauces, or some sort of pastry dish.  Roasts could be of any meat, which was not necessarily roasted; but the preferred dish of a truly fine dinner was wild feathered game, spit-roasted and served rather simply.  Dessert was molded ice-cream only, to the exclusion of all other sweets.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;{{rp|207}}  Despite Post's complaints about extra entrées, many dinners continued to feature two meat courses between the fish and the roast.

Post's first book was published during Prohibition, and she noted, "A water glass standing alone at each place makes such a meager and untrimmed looking table that most people put on at least two wine glasses, sherry and champagne, or claret and sherry, and pour something pinkish or yellowish into them. [...] Those few who still have cellars, serve wines exactly as they used to, white wine, claret, sherry and Burgundy warm, champagne ice cold; and after dinner, green mint poured over crushed ice in little glasses, and other liqueurs of room temperature."&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|205}}

After [[World War II]], dinners were curtailed even more.  As Post writes in the 1950 edition of her book, the shorter "informal" meal of her earlier book had become the norm for formal dinners:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under no circumstances does a modern dinner, no matter how formal, consist of more than:&lt;br/&gt;
# Soup or oysters or melon or clams&lt;br/&gt;
# Fish or entrée&lt;br/&gt;
# Roast&lt;br/&gt;
# Salad&lt;br/&gt;
# Dessert&lt;br/&gt;
After-dinner coffee&lt;ref name="Post2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Post|first=Emily|title=Etiquette: The Blue Book of Social Usage|location=New York|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company |year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|338}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to the set courses, little relish dishes of radishes, celery, olives, or almonds could be set on the table as "hors-d'œuvre".  Wines, too, were often greatly reduced in number.  [[Amy Vanderbilt]] noted in her book, ''The Complete Book of Etiquette'', "At a formal dinner champagne may be the only wine served after the service of sherry with the soup."&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|350}}

This five-course service might be further reduced by serving either soup or fish (or shellfish) as a first course, but not both.  Dinners in the French style usually include a cheese course after the roast, generally resulting in a 6-course meal (see, for example, the formal menus in Richard Olney's ''The French Menu Cookbook''&lt;ref name="Olney"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olney|first=Richard|title=The French Menu Cookbook (revised edition)|location=Boston|publisher=[[David R. Godine, Publisher|David R. Godine]]|date=1985|isbn=978-0773720695}}&lt;/ref&gt;); alternatively, one or more of the other courses can be omitted (see, for example, the formal menus in Simone Beck's ''Simca's Cuisine''&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Simone|title=Simca's Cuisine|location=New York|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Dinners in the American style often place the salad as a first course instead of soup, an innovation that appeared in the 1950s in California and was noted by Vanderbilt &lt;ref name="Vanderbilt"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/amyvanderbiltsco00vandrich |last=Vanderbilt |first=Amy |date=1957 |title=Amy Vanderbilt's Complete Book of Etiquette|location=Garden City, New York|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc.|accessdate=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340}}; in this arrangement, dessert is served immediately after the roast.  Wine service may include a separate wine for each course, or simply be champagne throughout; or, most commonly, service may be limited to three wines: a white for the soup and fish, a red for the roast, and a sweet wine or champagne for dessert.  

These and similar arrangements of four- and five-course formal dinners were the norm throughout the second half of the 20th century.

==Mechanism of directed rotation==
Butyl methyl sulfide is an asymmetrical [[thioether]] which is achiral in the gas phase. The molecule can adsorbed to the surface through either of the sulfur's two [[lone pair]]. This gives rise to the surface bound chirality of the molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baber|first=Ashleigh E.|author2=Tierney, Heather L. |author3=Sykes, E. Charles H. |title=A Quantitative Single-Molecule Study of Thioether Molecular Rotors|journal=ACS Nano|date=25 November 2008|volume=2|issue=11|pages=2385–2391|doi=10.1021/nn800497y|pmid=19206406}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[asymmetry]] of the molecular surface interface gives rise to an asymmetrical barrier to rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tierney|first=Heather L.|author2=Han, Jeong Woo |author3=Jewell, April D. |author4=Iski, Erin V. |author5=Baber, Ashleigh E. |author6=Sholl, David S. |author7=Sykes, E.

Electrons [[quantum tunneling]] from the STM tip electrically excite molecular vibrations, which couple to rotational modes.&lt;ref name=register/&gt; The rotation of the motor can be controlled by adjusting the electron flux from the scanning tunneling microscope and the background temperature.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; The tip of the scanning electron microscope acts as an electrode. The [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiralities]] of the tip of the STM and the molecule determine the rate and direction of rotation.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; Images taken of the molecule at 5 [[Kelvin|K]] and under non-perturbative scanning conditions show a crescent-shaped protrusion of the molecule.&lt;ref name=si&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/extref/nnano.2011.142-s1.pdf|title=Experimental demonstration of a single-molecule electric motor - SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION|accessdate=2011-08-06|doi=10.1038/nnano.2011.142|bibcode=2011NatNa...6..625T|volume=6|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|pages=625–629}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the temperature is raised to 8 K, the molecule starts rotating along six orientations determined by the hexagonal structure of the copper it is adsorbed on. In this case, a STM image taken of the molecule appears as a hexagon as the timescale of the imaging is much slower than the rotation rate of the molecule.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;

==Determination of rate and direction of rotation==
The six states of rotation of the molecule can be determined by aligning the tip of the scanning electron microscope asymmetrically on the side of one of the lobes of the molecule during spectroscopy measurements. When the butyl tail is nearest to the tip of the microscope, the tunneling current would be maximum and vice versa. The position of the molecule on the surface can be determined by the tunneling current. By plotting the position versus time the rate and direction of rotation can be determined.&lt;ref name=si/&gt; At higher temperatures, the single-molecule motor rotates too fast (up to one million rotations per second at 100 K)&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2033958/Worlds-smallest-electric-motor-SINGLE-molecule.html|title=Size matters: World’s smallest electric motor is a SINGLE molecule|publisher=[[Mail Online]]|accessdate=2011-08-06|location=London|first=Ted|last=Thornhill}}&lt;/ref&gt; to monitor.&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt;

==Application==
The single-molecule electric motor can be efficiently used in engineering,&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt; nanotechnological applications and medicinal applications,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; where drugs could be delivered to specified locations more accurately.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; By altering the chemical structure of the molecule, it could become a component of a [[nanoelectromechanical system]] (NEMS). It also has potential to be utilized to generate microwave radiation.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Either the oxidiser or the fuel, or both, should be a liquid to facilitate mixing, and intimate contact between the materials for a fast [[reaction rate]].

Sprengel suggested [[nitric acid]], [[nitrate]]s and [[chlorate]]s as oxidisers, and [[nitroaromatic]]s (e.g. [[nitrobenzene]]) as fuels. Other Sprengel explosives used at various times include [[charcoal]] with [[liquid oxygen]] (an [[oxyliquit]]), "Rackarock", and [[ANFO]] [[ammonium nitrate]] (oxidiser) mixed with a fuel oil (fuel), normally diesel kerosene or [[nitromethane]]. Eventually ANFO supplanted all others because its oxidiser was the safest, and - due to its widespread use as a [[fertiliser]] in [[agriculture]] - also the cheapest.

"'''Rackarock'''" consisted of [[potassium chlorate]] and [[nitrobenzene]]. It was provided in the form of permeable cartridges of the chlorate, which were placed in wire baskets and dipped in the nitrobenzene for a few seconds before use. For underwater use, it could be provided in cans instead. It was famously used in the massive submarine [[Removal of Hell Gate rocks|demolition of Flood Rock]], a navigational hazard in [[Long Island Sound]] in 1885. The charge of over a hundred [[tonne]]s of explosive (laid in [[tunnel]]s 20 metres below sea level) destroyed approximately 600,000 tonnes of rock, and created a wave 76 m high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2006/06/02/nyregion/02islands.html|title=The east river is cleaner now and the birds say so|last=Whitt|first=Toni|date=2 June 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=12 Apr 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2399">{{about|the structure||Spring House (disambiguation)}}
A '''spring house''', or '''springhouse''', is a small building, usually of a single room, constructed over a [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]].  While the original purpose of a springhouse was to keep the spring water clean by excluding fallen leaves, animals, etc., the enclosing structure was also used for [[refrigeration]] before the advent of ice delivery and, later, electric refrigeration.  The water of the spring maintains a constant cool temperature inside the spring house throughout the year.  Food that would otherwise spoil, such as meat, fruit, or dairy products, could be kept there, safe from animal depredations as well. Springhouses thus often also served as [[wikt:pumphouse|pumphouse]]s, [[wikt:milkhouse|milkhouse]]s, and [[root cellar]]s.

In settings where no natural spring is available, another source of natural running water, such as a small creek or diverted portion of a larger creek, might be used.  In addition, some people put jars of milk in a bucket suspended by a rope in an "open-mouth" [[Water well|well]] during hot weather.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}

The [[Tomahawk Spring]] spring house at [[Tomahawk, West Virginia]], was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stump-grinder.jpg|thumb|Backhoe stump grinder attachment, showing carbide teeth and chips]]
[[File:Vertical stump grinder at work..jpg|thumb|Rotor vertical stump grinder at work.]]
A '''stump grinder''' or '''stump cutter''' is a [[power tool]] or equipment attachment that removes [[tree stump]]s by means of a rotating cutting disc that chips away the [[wood]].

Stump grinders can be the size of a [[lawn mower]] or as large as [[truck]].  Most accomplish their task by means of a high-speed disk with teeth that grinds the stump and [[root]]s into small [[woodchips|chips]].

A typical stump grinder incorporates a cutter wheel with fixed [[Tungsten carbide|carbide]] teeth. The cutter wheel movements are controlled by [[hydraulic cylinders]] to push the cutter head laterally through the stump and to raise and lower it.

Stump grinding is generally performed by a qualified arborist or landscaper, however it is possible to rent them from tool hire companies for DIY projects.

==Vertical stump grinder==
There are also other types of stump grinders that are applied to tractors, excavators and other construction equipment. These machines can completely remove the roots of the trees in a few seconds or recover the central part of the roots. Vertical stump grinders are usually used in forests, for plant biomass, for the forestry sector, and for the maintenance of green areas, etc. They can destroy an entire root of {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter to more than one meter deep in 30 seconds. Studies have shown that the normal stump grinder (with disc and teeth) can eliminate most of the first {{convert|20|-|25|cm|in|0}} of stumps, but for stumps with a bigger diameter the problem is not solved as the plant can start growing back. Instead, a vertical stump grinder can completely destroy tree stumps of up to {{convert|150|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter permanently. They can be affixed to tractors, excavators and others earth moving machinery.

}}

A '''terminal server''' enables organizations to connect devices with an [[RS-232]], [[EIA-422|RS-422]] or [[EIA-485|RS-485]] serial interface to a [[local area network]] (LAN). Products marketed as terminal servers can be very simple devices that do not offer any security functionality, such as [[data encryption]] and user authentication. The primary application scenario is to enable serial devices to access network server applications, or vice versa, where security of the data on the LAN is not generally an issue.  There are also many terminal servers on the market that have highly advanced security functionality to ensure that only qualified personnel can access various servers and that any data that is transmitted across the LAN, or over the Internet, is encrypted. Usually companies which need a terminal server with these advanced functions want to remotely control, monitor, diagnose and troubleshoot equipment over a telecommunications network.

A '''console server''' (also referred to as console access server, console management server, serial concentrator, or serial console server) is a device or service that provides access to the [[system console]] of a computing device via networking technologies.

==History==
Historically, a terminal server was a device that attached to serial [[RS-232]] devices, such as "green screen" [[text terminal]]s or serial printers, and transported traffic via [[TCP/IP]], [[Telnet]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]] or other vendor-specific network protocols (e.g., [[Local Area Transport|LAT]]) via an [[Ethernet]] connection.

[[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[DECserver]] 100 (1985), 200 (1986) and 300 (1991) are early examples of this technology. (An earlier version of this product, known as the [[DECSA]] Terminal Server was actually a test-bed or proof-of-concept for using the proprietary LAT protocol in commercial production networks.) With the introduction of inexpensive [[flash memory]] components, Digital's later DECserver 700 (1991) and 900 (1995) no longer shared with their earlier units the need to download their software from a "load host" (usually a Digital [[VAX]] or Alpha) using Digital's proprietary [[Maintenance Operations Protocol]] (MOP). In fact, these later terminal server products also included much larger flash memory and full support for the Telnet part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Many other companies entered the terminal-server market with devices pre-loaded with software fully compatible with LAT and Telnet.

==Modern usage==
A "terminal server" is used many ways but from a basic sense if a user has a serial device and they need to move data over the LAN, this is the product they need.

* '''Raw TCP socket connection:'''  A raw TCP socket connection which can be initiated from the terminal server or from the remote host/server. This can be point-to-point or shared, where serial devices (like card readers, scanners, bar code readers, weight scales, etc.) can be shared amongst multiple devices. TCP sessions can be initiated from the TCP server application or from the terminal server.
* '''Raw UDP socket connection:'''  For use with UDP based applications, terminal servers can convert serial equipment data for transport across UDP packets on a point-to-point basis or shared across multiple devices.
* '''Console management - reverse Telnet, reverse SSH:'''  In console management terminology, users can use [[reverse telnet|reverse Telnet]] or SSH to connect to a serial device. They run Telnet or SSH on their client (PC) and attach to the terminal server, then connect to the serial device.  In this application, terminal servers are also called [[console server]]s because they are used to connect to console ports which are found on products like routers, PBXes, switches and servers (Linux or Sun).  The idea is to gain access to those devices via their console port.
* '''Connect serial-based applications with a COM/TTY port driver:''' Many software applications have been written to communicate with devices that are directly connected to a server's serial [[COM (hardware interface)|COM]] ports (robotic assembly machines, scanners, card readers, sensors, blood analyzers, etc.).  Companies may want to network these applications because the devices that were directly connected to the server's COM ports need to be moved to a location some distance away from the application server.  Since the original application was designed to talk directly to a specific COM port, a solution seamless to both the application and device must be implemented to enable communication across an IP network. (i.e., a solution that makes the application think it is talking directly to a COM port.)  In this application, [[serial port]]s can be connected to network servers or workstations running [[COM port redirector]] software operating as a virtual COM port. Many terminal server vendors include COM port redirector software with their terminal servers.  This application need is most common in Windows environments, but also exists in Linux and Unix environments.
* '''Serial tunneling between two serial devices:'''  Serial tunneling enables users to establish a link across Ethernet to a serial port on another terminal server.
* '''Back to back:'''  This application is designed to solve a wiring problem.  For example, a user needs to replace RS-232, RS-422 or RS-485 wire and run their data over Ethernet without making any changes to the server or the ultimate serial device, a user wants to replace a parallel leased line modem network with their parallel Ethernet network, or someone has a pick and place machine that puts ICs on boards, and they want to move the server into a back room where the equipment will be safe from damage.  This application is ideal where a device exists with an application written to gather information from that device (common with sensors).  This application allows them to eliminate the wiring.  It can also be used with industrial devices (Allen-Bradley, Siemens, Modbus) so that those devices can be run transparently across the network.
* '''Virtual modem:'''  Virtual modem is another example of a back-to-back application. It may be used to replace modems but still use an AT command set. An IP address is typed into the AT command set instead of the phone number of a serial device.

== Console server ==
[[File:ConsoleServer.jpeg|thumb|A 32-port serial console server]]
A '''console server''' ('''console access server''', '''console management server''', '''serial concentrator''', or '''serial console server''') is a device or service that provides access to the [[system console]] of a computing device via networking technologies.

Most commonly, a console server provides a number of [[serial port]]s, which are then connected to the serial ports of other equipment, such as servers, routers or switches.  The consoles of the connected devices can then be accessed by connecting to the console server over a serial link such as a [[modem]], or over a network with [[terminal emulator]] software such as [[telnet]] or [[Secure Shell|ssh]], maintaining survivable connectivity that allows remote users to log in the various consoles without being physically nearby.

=== Description ===

[[File:96pTAB XL.jpg|thumbnail|A 96 port serial console server.]]
Dedicated console server appliances are available from a number of manufacturers in many configurations, with the number of serial ports ranging from one to 96.  These Console Servers are primarily used for secure remote access to Unix Servers, Linux Servers, switches, routers, firewalls, and any other device on the network with a console port. The purpose is to allow network operations center (NOC) personnel to perform secure remote data center management and [[out-of-band management]] of IT assets from anywhere in the world. Products marketed as Console Servers usually have highly advanced security functionality to ensure that only qualified personnel can access various servers and that any data that is transmitted across the LAN, or over the Internet, is encrypted. Marketing a product as a console server is very application specific because it really refers to what the user wants to do—remotely control, monitor, diagnose and troubleshoot equipment over a network or the Internet.

Some users have created their own console servers using off-the-shelf [[commodity computer]] hardware, usually with multiport serial cards typically running a slimmed-down [[Unix-like]] operating system such as [[Linux]].  Such "home-grown" console servers can be less expensive, especially if built from components that have been retired in upgrades, and allow greater flexibility by putting full control of the software driving the device in the hands of the administrator. This includes full access to and configurability of a wide array of security protocols and encryption standards, making it possible to create a console server that is more secure. However, this solution may have a higher [[Total cost of ownership|TCO]], less reliability and higher rack-space requirements, since most industrial console servers have the physical dimension of one [[rack unit]] (1U), whereas a desktop computer with full-size [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] cards requires at least 3U, making the home-grown solution more costly in the case of a [[Colocation centre|co-located]] infrastructure.

An alternative approach to a console server used in some [[Computer cluster|cluster]] setups is to [[null-modem]] wire and [[daisy chain (network topology)|daisy-chain]] consoles to otherwise unused serial ports on nodes with some other primary function.

'''''The Standard School Broadcast''''' was a weekly educational [[radio programming|radio program]] that went on the air in 1928 and promoted [[music appreciation]] for students in the western United States. It was the oldest educational radio program in America. Based in [[San Francisco, California]], the series was carried on [[NBC]] radio stations and via syndication. ''The Standard School Broadcast'' was devoted to music and American history. [[Carmen Dragon]] was music director of the programs for many years. The program's sponsor, [[Standard Oil of California]], was honored with a [[List of Peabody Award winners (1950–59)|Peabody Award]] for the series in 1958. In 1975, the program received the [[List of Peabody Award winners (1970–79)|Peabody Institutional Award]] "for 47 years of continuous educational radio service".

==History==
''The Standard School Broadcast'' began in October 1928 and was first heard in 72 schools via the NBC Pacific Network. Predating the comparable CBS Radio series ''[[The American School of the Air]]'', it was the oldest educational radio program in the United States.&lt;ref name="Liner Notes"/&gt;

The series presented hundreds of topics including the science of music, music as drama, and non-classical forms including jazz and folk. Guests ranged from [[Dorothy Warenskjold]] to [[Louis Armstrong]].&lt;ref name="Dunning"/&gt;{{Rp|634}} It evolved from a simple lecture program accompanied by a string trio into a program that combined concert hall, stage and documentary, with a symphony orchestra conducted by [[Carmen Dragon]] and a cast of professional performers.&lt;ref name="Liner Notes"/&gt;

''The Standard School Broadcast'' was a companion to the classical music radio program, ''[[The Standard Hour]]''. Both were sponsored by [[Chevron Corporation|Standard Oil of California]]. ''The Standard School Broadcast'' ran on NBC radio&lt;ref name="Dunning"&gt;[[John Dunning (writer)|Dunning, John]], ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc., 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-19-507678-3}} hardcover; revised edition of ''Tune In Yesterday'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|633–634|date=July 2014}} and, later, in syndication on the West Coast.&lt;ref name="Goldin Standard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=The+Standard+School+Broadcast |title=The Standard School Broadcast  |publisher=RadioGOLDINdex |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1943 brochure shows that the programs were carried on [[KNBR|KPO]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[KFI]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[KMJ (AM)|KMJ]] in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[KGW]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[KOMO (AM)|KOMO]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], [[KHQ]] in [[Spokane, Washington]], [[KMED]] in [[Medford, Oregon]], [[KDYL]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], KGLU in [[Safford, Arizona]], [[KVOA]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], and [[KYUM]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]], on Thursday at 10 a.m. Pacific time and 11 a.m. Mountain time. At that time, [[Carl Kalesch]] was the music director for the programs and John Grover was the announcer.&lt;ref name="Coutant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coutant.org/standard/index.html |title=This Hour Is Yours: Signature Theme of The Standard Hour and the Standard School Broadcast  |publisher=S. O. Coutant, Coutant.org |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme music for ''The Standard School Broadcast,'' as well as ''[[The Standard Hour]],'' was "This Hour Is Yours". The theme was composed by Julius Haug, a violinist in the [[San Francisco Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="Coutant"/&gt;

"It was simple theme music, 45 seconds long," wrote radio historian [[John Dunning (writer)|John Dunning]], "and listeners who loved it and requested 'the entire piece' were surprised when told there was no more."&lt;ref name="Dunning"/&gt;{{Rp|634}}

For many years, the broadcasts originated from NBC's largest radio studio in San Francisco. in the building which housed the network's KPO (later renamed KNBC and then [[KNBR]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americahurrah.com/NBC/NBCmemories3.htm |title=NBC Memories 1942–1964 by Bill Roddy, Chapter Three of Twelve, Studio A |accessdate=March 5, 2009 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317202112/http://americahurrah.com/NBC/NBCmemories3.htm |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}. Retrieved 2014-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides John Grover, announcers for the broadcasts included Hale Sparks and Fred Jorgenson.  Many of the programs were preserved on transcription discs or magnetic tape.&lt;ref name="Goldin Standard"/&gt;

==Accolades==
In [[List of Peabody Award winners (1950–59)|1958]], ''The Standard School Broadcast'' received a [[Peabody Award]] for radio education, "in recognition of continuous expansion and development over a 30-year period. This outstanding music appreciation series for schools combines educational value with highest musicianship, expert production, and utilization of appropriate musical groups of all types, instrumental and vocal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/standard-school-broadcast |title=Standard School Broadcast |publisher=[[Peabody Awards]] |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, ''The Standard School Broadcast'' received the [[List of Peabody Award winners (1970–79)|Peabody Institutional Award]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Standard School Broadcast'''s 47 years on the air throughout the Western states is an achievement to which any broadcaster could point with pride. It is doubly impressive to note that its programming has always been imaginative and entertaining as well as commercial-free. Its performers have included many of the world’s most distinguished musicians and almost single-handedly it has introduced the joys of good music to several generations of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/institutional-award-standard-school-broadcast-for-47-years-of-continuous-ed |title=Institutional Award: Standard School Broadcast for 47 Years of Continuous Educational Radio Service  |publisher=Peabody Awards |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Home media==
A few episodes of ''The Standard School Broadcast'' are available from old-time radio program collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originaloldradio.com/standard_school_broadcast.html |title=Standard School Broadcast  |publisher=Original Old Radio of Yesteryear |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the Chevron Research Company released a series of recordings edited from ''The Standard School Broadcast'' as a public service. The [[LP records]], with teachers guides, were available free of charge to elementary and junior high schools throughout the West, Rocky Mountain area and the Southwest.&lt;ref name="Liner Notes"&gt;Jones, Don, and Edward Franklin. Liner notes for ''America Through Five Centuries — Epilogue'' (SOCAL 20), 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; These out-of-print recordings have been sold on various websites.
