'''5677 Aberdonia''', provisional designation {{mp|1987 SQ|1}}, is a stony Koronis [[asteroid]] from the outer region of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 21 September 1987, by American astronomer [[Edward Bowell]] at Lowell's [[Anderson Mesa Station]] in Flagstaff, Arizona, United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-Aberdonia" /&gt; The asteroid was named for the Scottish [[University of Aberdeen]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

The [[S-type asteroid]] is a member of the [[Koronis family]], a group consisting of about 200 known bodies with nearly [[ecliptic|ecliptical orbits]]. It orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|outer]] main-belt at a distance of 2.7–3.0&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 4 years and 9 months (1,743 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.06 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 2[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the ecliptic.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

In 1954, a first [[precovery]] was obtained at [[Palomar Observatory]], extending the body's [[observation arc]] by 33 years prior to its official discovery at Anderson Mesa.&lt;ref name="MPC-Aberdonia" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Lightcurves ===

In October 2011, a rotational [[lightcurve]] of ''Aberdonia'' was obtained from photometric observations at the [[Palomar Transient Factory]] in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a [[rotation period]] of {{val|5.0813}} hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=2]]}}).&lt;ref name="Waszczak-2016" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the [[NEOWISE]] mission of NASA's space-based [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], ''Aberdonia'' measures 8.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.25,&lt;ref name="WISE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masiero-2011" /&gt; while the ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes an albedo of 0.24 and calculates a diameter of 8.2 kilometers with an [[absolute magnitude]] of 12.6.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named for the Scottish [[University of Aberdeen]] on its 500th anniversary in 1995. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[George Paget Thomson]] are the university's best known former holders of chairs of natural philosophy.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

The university is also known for its first chair of medicine in the English-speaking world, and for having taught astronomy already in the late 16th century.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The approved naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 15 February 1995 {{small|([[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 24765)}}.&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

The '''A272''' is a road in southeast [[England]]. It follows an approximate east-west route from near [[Heathfield, East Sussex|Heathfield]], [[East Sussex]] to the city of [[Winchester]], [[Hampshire]].

The eastern end of the A272 starts at a junction with the [[A267 road|A267]], {{convert|1.5|mi}} north-west of the village of [[Cross In Hand]], [[East Sussex]]. It heads west, crossing the [[A26 road|A26]] and [[A22 road|A22]] north of [[Uckfield]], and continues through [[Newick]] before going over the border into [[West Sussex]] at a point east of [[Scaynes Hill]]. It then bypasses the town of [[Haywards Heath]] and continues west, crossing the main [[London]]-[[Brighton]] [[A23 road]] at [[Bolney]].

The route continues, crossing the [[A24 road (Great Britain)|A24]] and passing through a number of villages and small towns in [[West Sussex]], such as [[Billingshurst]], [[Petworth]] and [[Midhurst]]. It then crosses the county boundary into [[Hampshire]] and reaches [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]], where it crosses the [[A3 road (Great Britain)|A3]] to the west of the town. The final section passes the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] property of [[Hinton Ampner]] and rises high on to the [[Hampshire]] [[downland|downs]], passing [[Cheesefoot Head]], before descending to merge with the [[A31 road|A31]] at Chilcomb to the east of [[Winchester]]. 

In former years, the A272 continued north-west from [[Winchester]] to [[Stockbridge, Hampshire|Stockbridge]], but this section has now been redesignated as the [[List of B roads in Great Britain|B3049]]. Today, after {{convert|1.3|mi}} it re-emerges from the A31 to run north to the Winnall Roundabout, Junction 9 of the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]]. Here it merges with the [[A34 road (England)|A34]], passing east and north of [[Winchester]] (with limited access to the [[A33 road|A33]] northbound), before re-emerging near Littleton. It then runs NW along the Andover Road (formerly [[List of B roads in Great Britain|B3420]]), terminating at the [[A30 road|A30]], an overall length of {{convert|85|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=50.994311,0.212688&amp;daddr=51.0112793,-0.4332312+to:A272&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.118394,-1.42067&amp;spn=0.1209,0.308304&amp;sll=50.962752,-0.302124&amp;sspn=0.242613,0.616608&amp;geocode=FYccCgMd0D4DAA%3BFc9eCgMdsWP5_ymjGrlAYr91SDGmkjt4F3jroQ%3BFbRYDAMd_Ofq_w&amp;t=h&amp;mra=dvme&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=11&amp;via=1&amp;z=12 |title= Directions to A272|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the north the B3420 continues across the [[River Test]] to [[Wherwell]] and [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]].

==Features==
The A272's route is predominantly [[rural]], despite being only {{convert|40|mi}} from the centre of [[London]] at its nearest point. Most of the time it passes through countryside, villages and small towns, and the only built-up area of any size that it traverses is [[Haywards Heath]] and its surrounding villages. Also, it has virtually no [[dual carriageway]] sections (just three very short sections between [[Petworth]] and [[Midhurst]]), and therefore gives the driver an experience which is reminiscent of English country roads as they were 50 or more years ago.

While it has been said that the A272 follows part of the route that was taken by [[pilgrim]]s travelling between the [[cathedral]] cities of [[Winchester]] and [[Canterbury]] it is unlikely because, for most of its length, it passes through the low [[weald]] of [[Sussex]]. Prior to the development of modern roads, this was difficult for travellers, because of the extensive forest and tracts of low-lying marshy ground. The more likely route was the [[Pilgrims' Way]], which followed the [[chalk]] [[escarpment]] of the [[North Downs]].

==In popular culture==
The road is the subject of a book by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] author [[Pieter Boogaart]]: ''A272 - An Ode to a Road'' (Pallas Athene, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Boogaart|first=P|title=A272: An Ode to a Road|publisher=Pallas Athene|date=2000|ISBN=1-873429-29-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''''arrondissement''''' ({{IPA-fr|aʁɔ̃dismɑ̃}}) is a level of [[administrative divisions of Haiti|administrative division in Haiti]].

{{As of|2015}}, the 10 [[departments of Haiti]] were divided into 42 arrondissements.&lt;ref name=IHSI&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars 2015 Population Totale, Population de 18 ans et Plus Menages et Densites Estimes en 2015 |url=http://www.ihsi.ht/pdf/projection/Estimat_PopTotal_18ans_Menag2015.pdf |publisher=Institut Haïtien de Statistique et d’Informatique (IHSI) |accessdate=20 June 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106110552/http://www.ihsi.ht/pdf/projection/Estimat_PopTotal_18ans_Menag2015.pdf |archivedate=6 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrondissements are further divided into [[List of communes of Haiti|communes]] and [[communal section]]s.

The term [[arrondissement]] can be roughly translated into English as '''district'''.&lt;ref&gt;André de Laubadère, Jean-Claude Vénézia, Yves Gaudemet, ''Traité de droit administratif'', 12th edition, LGDJ, 1992, vol. 1, nr 168-169&lt;/ref&gt; A more etymologically precise, but less allegorical, definition would be '''encirclements,''' from the French ''arrondir,'' to encircle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/arrondissement CNRTL - arrondissement (definition)]&lt;/ref&gt; Because no single translation adequately conveys the layered sense of the word, the French term is usually used in English writing.

The Arrondissements are listed below, by department:

{{History of the British Isles}}
The term '''Britain''' is a linguistic descendant ([[Linguistic reconstruction|reflex]]) of one of the oldest known names for [[Great Britain]], an island off the north-western coast of [[continental Europe]]. The terms '''Briton''' and '''British''', similarly derived, refer to its inhabitants and, to varying extents, the [[List of islands of the British Isles|smaller islands in the vicinity]]. "British Isles" is the only ancient [[Terminology of the British Isles|name for these islands]] to survive in general usage.

==Etymology==
"Britain" comes from {{lang-la|Britannia~Brittania}}, via [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|Bretaigne}}'' and Middle English ''{{lang|enm|Breteyne}}'', possibly influenced by [[Old English language|Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|Bryten(lond)}}'', probably also from Latin ''Brittania'', ultimately an adaptation of the [[Common Brittonic]] name for the island, ''*Pritanī''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Britain&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Britain |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, Hector Munro, Early Scotland: The Picts, the Scots and the Welsh of Southern Scotland, Cambridge University Press, 1949 (2013 reprint), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

An early written reference to the British Isles may derive from the works of the Greek explorer [[Pytheas]] of [[Marseille|Massalia]]; later Greek writers such as [[Diodorus of Sicily]] and [[Strabo]] who quote Pytheas' use of variants such as {{lang|grc|Πρεττανική}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Prettanikē}}), "The Britannic [land, island]", and {{lang|grc-Latn|nēsoi brettaniai}}, "Britannic islands", with ''{{lang|cel-x-proto|Pretani}}'' being a Celtic word that might mean "the painted ones" or "the tattooed folk", referring to body decoration (see below).&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe, Barry (2012). ''Britain Begins.'' Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for the island is ''{{lang|cy|(Ynys) Prydain}}''. This may demonstrate that the original [[Common Brittonic]] form had initial P- not B- (which would give **''Brydain'') and -t- not -tt- (else **''Prythain''). This may be explained as containing a stem *''prit-'' (Welsh ''{{lang|cy|pryd}}'', [[Old Irish]] ''{{lang|sga|cruith}}''; &lt; [[Proto-Celtic]] ''{{lang|cel-x-proto|kwrit-}}''), meaning "shape, form", combined with an adjectival suffix. This leaves us with *''Pritanī''.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"&gt;Chadwick 1949, pp. 66–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maier 1997, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daibhi"&gt;Ó Cróinín 2005, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunbavin"&gt;Dunbavin 1998, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oman15-16&gt;{{citation |editor1-first=Charles |editor1-last=Oman |editor2-first=William |editor2-last=Chadwick |first=Charles |last=Oman |contribution=England Before the Norman Conquest |volume=vol.

==History==
===Written record===

The first known written use of the word was an [[ancient Greek]] [[transliteration]] of the original P-Celtic term. It is believed to have appeared within a [[periplus]] written in about 325 BC by the geographer and explorer [[Pytheas]] of [[Marseille|Massalia]], but no copies of this work survive. The earliest existing records of the word are quotations of the periplus by later authors, such as those within [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus of Sicily]]'s [[Bibliotheca historica|history]] (c. 60 BC to 30 BC), [[Strabo]]'s [[Geographica]] (c. 7 BC to AD 19) and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] [[Naturalis Historia|Natural History]] (AD 77).&lt;ref&gt;Book I.4.2–4, Book II.3.5, Book III.2.11 and 4.4, Book IV.2.1, Book IV.4.1, Book IV.5.5, Book VII.3.1&lt;/ref&gt; According to Strabo, Pytheas referred to Britain as ''Bretannikē'', which is treated a feminine noun.&lt;ref name=LSJBrettanike&gt;{{LSJ|*bretaniko/s|Βρεττανική|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strabo(1.4.2)&gt;Strabo's ''Geography'' Book I.

This term along with other relevant ones, subsequently appeared inter alia in the following works:

*[[Procopius]], in the 6th century AD, used the terms ''[[Brittia]]'' and ''Brettania'' though he considered them to be different islands, the former being located between the latter and [[Thule]].

As seen above, the original spelling of the term is disputed. Ancient manuscripts alternated between the use of the ''P-'' and the ''B-'', and many linguists believe Pytheas's original manuscript used ''P-'' (''Prettania'') rather than ''B-''. Although ''B-'' is more common in these manuscripts, many modern authors quote the Greek or Latin with a ''P-'' and attribute the ''B-'' to changes by the Romans in the time of [[Julius Caesar]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=John | last=Rhys | authorlink=John Rhys | title=Certain National Names of the Aborigines of the British Isles: Sixth Rhind Lecture | journal=The Scottish Review | volume=XVIII | date=July{{ndash}}October 1891 | pages=120–143 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g0LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Certain+National+Names+of+the+Aborigines+of+the+British+Isles&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=yYgQSffVBoyGM8LQnIoH#PPP5,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relevant, attested sometimes later, change of the spelling of the word(s) in Greek, as is also sometimes done in modern Greek, from being written with a double [[tau]] to being written with a double [[Nu (letter)|nu]], is likewise also explained by Roman influence, from the aforementioned change in the spelling in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[[headword|lemma]] ''{{lang|el|Βρετανία}}''; {{cite book|title=[[Babiniotis dictionary|Dictionary of Modern Greek]]|first=Georgios|last=Babiniotis|author-link=Georgios Babiniotis|publisher=Lexicology Centre|location=[[Athens]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Linguistics|linguist]] Karl Schmidt states that the "name of the island was originally transmitted as Πρεττανία (with Π instead of Β) ... as is confirmed by its etymology".&lt;ref name=schmidt68&gt;{{harvnb|Schmidt|1993|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Barry Cunliffe]]:
:It is quite probable that the description of Britain given by the Greek writer Diodorus Siculus in the first century BC derives wholly or largely from Pytheas. What is of particular interest is that he calls the island "Pretannia" (Greek "Prettanikē"), that is "the island of the Pretani, or Priteni". "Pretani" is a Celtic word that probably means "the painted ones" or "the tattooed folk", referring to body decoration - a reminder of Caesar's observations of woad-painted barbarians. In all probability the word "Pretani" is an ethnonym (the name by which the people knew themselves), but it remains an outside possibility that it was their continental neighbours who described them thus to the Greek explorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Barry|last=Cunliffe  |title=Britain Begins |publisher= Oxford University Press|location = Oxford, UK |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-0-19-967945-4|page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman period===
Following [[Julius Caesar]]'s expeditions to the island in 55 and 54 BC, ''Brit(t)an(n)ia'' was predominantly used to refer simply to the island of Great Britain. After the Roman conquest under the Emperor [[Claudius]] in AD 43, it came to be used to refer to the [[Roman Britain|Roman province of Britain]] (later two provinces), which at one stage consist of part of the island of Great Britain south of [[Hadrian's wall]].&lt;ref name=Snyder_pg12&gt;{{cite book

===Medieval===
In [[Old English]] or Anglo-Saxon, the Graeco-Latin term referring to Britain entered in the form of ''Bryttania'', as attested by [[Alfred the Great]]'s translation of [[Orosius]]' ''Seven Books of History Against the Pagans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Anglo-Saxon Verse-Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhQNAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA292#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Walter John|last=Sedgefield|page=292|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Latin]] name ''[[Britannia]]'' re-entered the language through the [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|Bretaigne}}''. The use of ''[[Britons (historic)|Britons]]'' for the inhabitants of Great Britain is derived from the [[Old French]] ''bretun'', the term for the people and language of [[Brittany]], itself derived from Latin and Greek, e.g. the {{lang|grc|Βρίττωνες}} of [[Procopius]].&lt;ref name=Procopius/&gt; It was introduced into [[Middle English]] as ''{{lang|enm|brutons}}'' in the late 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], s.v. "Briton".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
There is much conflation of the terms [[United Kingdom]], Great Britain, Britain, and [[England]]. In many ways accepted usage allows some of these to overlap, but some common usages are incorrect.

The term ''Britain'' is widely used as a common name for the [[sovereign state]] of the ''United Kingdom'', or UK for short. The United Kingdom includes three countries on the largest island, which can be called ''the island of Britain'' or ''Great Britain'': these are England, [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. However the United Kingdom also includes [[Northern Ireland]] on the neighbouring island of [[Ireland]], the remainder of which is not part of the United Kingdom. ''England'' is not synonymous with ''Britain'', ''Great Britain'', or ''United Kingdom''.

The classical writer, [[Ptolemy]], referred to the larger island as ''great Britain'' (''megale Bretannia'') and to Ireland as ''little Britain'' (''mikra Brettania'') in his work, ''[[Almagest]]'' (147–148 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Claudii Ptolemaei Opera quae exstant omnia|author=Claudius Ptolemy|authorlink=Ptolemy|editor1-last=Heiberg|editor1-first=J.L.|publisher=in aedibus B.

After the Anglo-Saxon period, ''Britain'' was used as a historical term only.  [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]] ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''c.''&amp;nbsp;1136) refers to the
island of Great Britain as ''Britannia major'' ("Greater Britain"), to distinguish it from ''Britannia minor'' ("Lesser Britain"), the continental region which approximates to modern Brittany, which had been settled in the fifth and sixth centuries by Celtic migrants from the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24083162|title=Is Great Britain really a 'small island'?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Great Britain'' was first used officially in 1474, in the instrument drawing up the proposal for a marriage between [[Cecily of York|Cecily]] the daughter of [[Edward IV of England]], and [[James IV of Scotland|James]] the son of [[James III of Scotland]], which described it as "this Nobill Isle, callit Gret Britanee". As noted above it was used again in 1604, when [[James I of England|King James VI and I]] styled himself "King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland".

The term ''Great Britain'' later served to distinguish the large island of Britain from the French region of Brittany (in French ''Grande-Bretagne'' and ''Bretagne'' respectively). With the [[Acts of Union 1707]] it became the official name of the new state created by the union of the [[Kingdom of England]] (which then included Wales) with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], forming the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=kingdom&gt;"After the political union of England and Scotland in 1707, the nation's official name became 'Great Britain'", ''The American Pageant, Volume 1'', Cengage Learning (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, the name of the country was changed to ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'', recognising that Ireland had ceased to be a distinct kingdom and was incorporated into the union. After [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Irish independence]] in the early 20th century, the name was changed to ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', which is still the official name. In contemporary usage therefore, ''Great Britain'', while synonymous with the island of Britain, and capable of being used to refer politically to [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] in combination, is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United Kingdom as a whole. For example, the term ''[[Team GB]]'' and ''Great Britain'' were used to refer to the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|United Kingdom's Olympic team]] in 2012 and this usage created controversy as some interpreted it as excluding [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Melanie|title=So far as the Olympic Games are concerned, the UK seems to have been abolished|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2185267/Goodbye-Team-UK-Is-Northern-Ireland-awkward-included-formally.html|accessdate=5 May 2013|newspaper=Mail Online|date=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonym for a citizen of the United Kingdom is ''British''.

The '''Bubnoff unit''' (abbreviated '''B''') is a unit of speed equal to 1 m / 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; a. In other words, 1 B is equal to 1 meter in 1,000,000 years, 1 millimeter in 1,000 years, or one micrometer per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/69792154|title=Encyclopedia of weather and climate|last=Allaby|first=Michael|date=|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=9780816063505|edition=|location=|publication-place=New York, USA|pages=501|type=|oclc=69792154}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was defined in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, A. G., 1969, Geological time-distance rates -- the Bubnoff unit: Geological Society of America Bulletin v. 80, p. 549-551.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bubnoff unit is employed in [[geology]] to measure rates of lowering of earth surfaces due to [[erosion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/835969159|title=A Dictionary of Geology and Earth Sciences|last=Allaby|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199653065|edition=4.|location=|publication-place=|pages=82|type=|oclc=835969159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is named after the Russian (German-Baltic) geologist [[Serge von Bubnoff]] (1888–1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/810946330|title=A Dictionary of Environment and Conservation|last=Allaby|first=Michael|last2=Park|first2=Chris|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199641666|edition=2.|location=|publication-place=|pages=60|type=|oclc=810946330}}&lt;/ref&gt; An erosion speed of 1 B also means that 1 m³ of earth is being removed from an area of 1&amp;nbsp;km² in 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;Kearey, P. (2001) ''The New Penguin Dictionary of Geology''. Penguin, London, 336 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to everyday phenomena, erosion is  under most circumstances (excluding rapid events like [[landslides]]) an extremely slow process, calling for such a specialized unit. For instance, the current average rate of erosion over the Earth's landmasses has been estimated at 30 B (30 m in a million years). There are, however, great regional differences in erosion speed. As an extreme example the [[Drainage basin|watershed]] area of the [[Semani River]] in [[Albania]] is eroding at a rate of almost 3000 B (3 millimeters per year), the river having been estimated to transport about 4600 tons of earth per year from the average square kilometer in its watershed.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, A. (1993) The Work of Rivers. In [[Donald Duff|Duff, D.]] (ed.) ''Holmes' Principles of Physical Geology'', Chapman &amp; Hall, London, 312-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bubnoff unit was introduced because of a desire for a standard unit to replace the multitude of units in use, such as feet per year, centimeters per year, meters per decade, and so on. One criticism leveled was that by introducing the Bubnoff unit, it would obscure the rate of erosion behind a unit no one besides specialists understood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/82/12/3475.full.pdf Robert R. Berg and Anthony F. Gangi, ''Bubnoff Unit: An Objection'', Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 82, p. 3475-3476, December 1971]&lt;/ref&gt;

The region known as '''Cabeça do Cachorro''' (''Dog‘s head'') is the area comprising the northwesternmost end of the state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], [[Brazil]], bordering on [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]].

This region roughly coincides with the Brazilian municipality of [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]] and parts of [[Japurá]], and shares international borders with the [[Venezuela]]n state of [[Amazonas (Venezuelan state)|Amazonas]] (to the northeast), and the [[Colombia]]n departments of [[Guainía Department|Guainía]] (to north), [[Vaupés Department|Vaupés]] (to west) and [[Amazonas Department|Amazonas]] (to southwest). The [[Brazilian Army]] maintains a border platoon next to the border tripoint, at the village of [[Cucuí]], where there is also a [[Brazilian Air Force]] base.

''Cabeça do Cachorro'' means, literally, ''"Dog's Head"'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. The name was given after the shape of this region's map, that resembles the head of a dog with its mouth wide open. This picturesque geographical shape was defined by the [[Vásquez_Cobo-Martins_treaty|Treaty of Bogotá]], which was signed by Colombia and Brazil in 1907 and defined the borders between the two countries according to the [[uti possidetis]] criterium. These borders were later confirmed by a supplementary Colombian-Brazilian treaty in 1928.

The area has several [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Amerindian]] reservations. The municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, in Cabeça do Cachorro, is the first in Brazil to adopt an Amerindian language, [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]], as co-official with Portuguese.

The region also has one of the largest [[niobium]] reserves in the world.

The '''dwell time''' in [[GNSS]] is the time required to test for the presence of a [[satellite]] signal for a certain combination of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;GPS World 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A [[GNSS]] [[satellite]] can be detected if it is present or not on a sky through a [[:wikt:search|search]] process, based on [[correlation]] of a received signal with a reference signal stored in the [[:wikt:receiver|receiver]].
 
The dwell times are associated with the performance of a certain [[detector]]. They can be classified into single dwell times, when the decision is taken in one step, and multiple dwell times,&lt;ref&gt;Lohan2004&lt;/ref&gt; when the decision is taken in two or more steps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1590">An '''estate village''' is a village wholly within and part of a private estate. Usually several hundred years old, they are often well preserved by the family that owns the estate. They often have small commercial operations such as pubs, craft shops, and village stores, as well as rented residential housing. The individual properties are maintained and managed by the estate manager and rented individually to residential and commercial tenants.

Some examples of British estate villages are:

The '''European Chamber of Commerce in Korea''' ('''ECCK''') is a non-profit, non-political organization, established to support European businesses operating in or related to Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ealink.eu/business-support/partners/european-chamber-of-commerce-in-korea|title=European Chamber of Commerce in Korea (ECCK) - The EU Asia Business Link|website=EU Asia Business Link|language=en-us|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary objective of the Chamber is to provide its members with information, communication, and access pertaining to the business and regulatory environment of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/07/177_208122.html |title=FTC head briefs on competition rules |date=2016-06-28 |access-date=2016-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817110314/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/07/177_208122.html |archivedate=2016-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ECCK’s headquarter is located in [[Seoul|Seoul, Korea]], and a chapter is located in [[Busan]].

== History ==
By registering with the [[Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (South Korea)]], the ECCK was officially founded as a non-profit, non-political organization on December 3, 2012. The ECCK is not affiliated with any branch of the Korean government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/smeip/provider/european-chamber-commerce-korea|title=- European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Entrusted with member's mandate, the [[Board of directors|Board of Director]] presides over the organization. The [[Advisory board|Advisory Board]] embodies representatives of national chambers and embassies, providing general guidance and advice. The [[Secretariat (administrative office)|Secretariat]] functions to execute the ECCK's day-to-day activities and operations.

=== Board of Directors ===
The Board of Directors consists of nine elected persons: Chairman, Vice Chairman, Director, Treasurer and Trustees.

The '''''Recherche''''' was a 20-gun [[Marsouin class scow|''Marsouin'' class scow]] of the [[French Navy]], later reclassified as a 12-gun frigate. She earned fame as one of the ships of [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]]' expedition, along with [[French ship Espérance (1781)|''Espérance'']]. [[Recherche Bay]] was named after her.

== Career ==
The ship was built as ''Truite'' and served under this name until July 1791, when she was renamed to ''Recherche'' and recommissioned as a 12-gun frigate.

She departed from Brest on 29 September 1791 for an exploration mission in search of Lapérouse, sailing to New Caledonia. [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] died aboard on 21 July 1793.

On 28 October 1793, she was captured by the Dutch at [[Surabaya]], only to be restituted to France in February 1794. In September, she was sold to Holland, and two months later she was sold for scrap.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3977">A '''geoportal''' is a type of [[web portal]] used to find and access [[geographic]] information ([[geospatial]] information) and associated geographic services (display, editing, analysis, etc.) via the [[Internet]].  Geoportals are important for effective use of [[geographic information systems]] (GIS) and a key element of [[Spatial Data Infrastructure]] (SDI).

Geographic information providers, including government agencies and commercial sources, use geoportals to publish descriptions ([[geospatial metadata]]) of their geographic information.  Geographic information consumers, professional or casual, use geoportals to search and access the information they need.  Thus geoportals serve an increasingly important role in the sharing of geographic information and can avoid duplicated efforts, inconsistencies, delays, confusion, and wasted resources.

==Background==
The United States '''National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)''', started in 1994 (see [[OMB Circular A-16]]), is considered the earliest geoportal concept.  The U.S. '''Federal Geospatial Data Committee (FGDC)''' coordinated development of the '''NSDI Clearinghouse Network''', the first large geoportal.  It has many distributed catalogs that can be searched via a client interface.

First released in 2003, the '''Geospatial One-Stop (GOS)''' geoportal was developed as part of a U.S. [[e-government]] initiative.  Unlike the NSDI Clearinghouse Network, GOS was built around a centralized metadata catalog database, with an architecture that links users to data providers through a Web-based geoportal.  The user of GOS may employ a simple Web browser (thin client) or may interface directly with a GIS (thick client).

More recently, there has been a proliferation of geoportals for sharing of geographic information based on region or theme.  Examples include the INSPIRE, or Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community geoportal, the [[NatCarb]] geoportal, which provides geographic information concerning [[carbon sequestration]] in the United States, and [[UNSDI]], the United Nations Spatial Data Infrastructure.

Modern web-based geoportals include direct access to raw data in multiple formats, complete metadata, online visualization tools so users can create maps with data in the portal, automated provenance linkages across users, datasets and created maps, commenting mechanisms to discuss data quality and interpretation, and sharing or exporting created maps in various formats. Open portals allow user contribution of datasets as well.

In September 2011, GOS was retired and the content it included by then became part of the broader [[open data]] site [http://geo.data.gov (Geo.)Data.gov]. At the same time, the United States federal government launched the [http://www.geoplatform.gov Geospatial Platform], which represents a shift from focusing on cataloging references to resources, to providing shared web services for national significant datasets, API for developers, and end-user applications (built on those web services and API).

[[File:YurtnederzettingUlaanbaator.jpg|thumb|A ger district on the outskirts of [[Ulaanbaatar]]]]
A '''ger district''' ({{lang-mn|гэр хороолол}}, ''ger khoroolol'') is a form of residential district in [[Mongolia]]n settlements. They usually consist of parcels with one or more detached houses or [[Yurt|gers]] (hence the name), surrounded by two-metre high wooden [[fence]]s.  In other countries, gers are known as [[yurt]]s.

Most ger districts are not connected to water supplies, so people get their drinking water from public wells.  For a warm shower or a bath, there are [[Public bathing|bathhouses]]. Since there is no sewer system, ger district parcels usually have a [[pit toilet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engel|first1=David|title=Ulaanbaatar’s GerDistrict Issues: Changes and Attitudes|url=http://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3109&amp;context=isp_collection|publisher=[[School for International Training]]|accessdate=20 June 2016|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small settlements, like [[sums of Mongolia|sum]] centers, may consist almost exclusively of ger districts. Even in Mongolia's capital Ulaanbaatar, around 62% of the population live in such districts. However, only about 43% of the ger district residents in Ulaanbaatar actually live in gers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statis.ub.gov.mn/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=254&amp;Itemid=99999999 Ulaanbaatar Statistical Office. 2008 Annual Report]. Population data as of 01-01-2009. Sheet "HH type UB"&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the districts in Ulaanbaatar  have existed for more than 100 years, for example the one around [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery|Gandan]], but many of those farther away from the city centre are the result of recent migration and the high price of [[Ugsarmal bair|other accommodation]] in Ulaanbaatar.

An oft-cited problem of ger districts in Ulaanbaatar and a number of other larger Mongolian cities is the [[air pollution]] (especially in winter) caused by the use of simple iron [[stoves]] for cooking and heating.

'''Healy''' is a [[submarine volcano]] located among [[New Zealand]]'s [[Kermadec Islands]]. Its last major eruption took place around 1360, creating a large [[caldera]]. 

The volcano's name originates from the British-Australian explorer and navigator Captain Jake Healy who first wrote about the volcano in his journal after noticing [[Volcanic glass]] in the water whilst fishing.

The '''Heirtzler Fracture Zone''' ({{coord|63|30|S|162|30|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is an undersea [[fracture zone]] named for [[James R. Heirtzler]], a geophysicist who was a pioneer in geomagnetics studies. The name was proposed by [[Steven C. Cande]], [[William F. Haxby]], and [[Carol A. Raymond]] of the Lamont–Doherty Geological Observatory (now the [[Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory]]), and was approved by the [[Advisory Committee on Undersea Features]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

Dr '''John Crawfurd''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of London|FRS]]}} (13 August 1783 – 11 May 1868) was a Scottish physician, colonial administrator and diplomat, and author. He is now best known for his work on Asian languages, his ''History of the Indian Archipelago'', and his role in founding Singapore as the last British Resident of Singapore; the position of Resident was replaced by the [[Governor of the Straits Settlements]].

==Early life==
He was born on [[Islay]], in [[Argyll]], [[Scotland]], the son of Samuel Crawfurd, a physician, and Margaret Campbell; and was educated at the school in [[Bowmore]]. He followed his father's footsteps in the study of medicine and completed his medical course at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1803, at the age of 20.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;
[[File:Bowmore - geograph.org.uk - 15838.jpg|thumb|[[Bowmore]] on [[Islay]] today.]]

Crawfurd joined the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], as a Company surgeon, and was posted to India's Northwestern Provinces (now [[Uttar Pradesh]]), working in the area around [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]]&lt;ref name=IllustTimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary |work=Illustrated Times |date=16 May 1868 |accessdate=24 July 2014 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000357/18680516/062/0015| publisher = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1803–1808. He saw service in the campaigns of [[Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake|Baron Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clements Robert Markham|Markham, Clements Robert]] (1881) ''The Fifty Years' Work of the Royal Geographical Society'', [https://archive.org/stream/fiftyyearsworkof00markiala#page/52/mode/2up p. 53].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the East Indies==
Crawfurd was sent in 1808 to [[Penang]], where he applied himself to the study of the [[Malay language]] and culture.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; In Penang he met [[Stamford Raffles]] for the first time.

In 1811, Crawfurd accompanied Raffles on [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]]'s [[Java Invasion]], which overcame the Dutch.&lt;ref name=IllustTimes /&gt; Raffles was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of [[Java (island)|Java]] by Minto during the 45-day operation, and Crawfurd was appointed the post of Resident Governor at the Court of [[Yogyakarta]] in November 1811. There he took a firm line against Sultan [[Hamengkubuwana II]]. The Sultan was encouraged by [[Pakubuwono IV]] of [[Surakarta]] to assume he had support in resisting the British; who sided with his opponents his son the [[Hamengkubuwana III|Crown Prince]] and [[Pangeran Natsukusuma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ricklefs, Merle Calvin |title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since C. 1200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GrWCmZoEBMC&amp;pg=PA148|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4480-5|pages=148–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan's palace, the [[Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat]], was besieged and taken by British-led forces in June 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Day, Tony |title=Fluid Iron: State Formation in Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0cGznRflQy4C&amp;pg=PA118|date=2002|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2617-8|pages=118–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Resident, Crawfurd also pursued the study of the Javanese language, and cultivated personal relationships with Javanese aristocrats and literati. He was impressed by [[Javanese music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zon, Bennett |title=Representing Non-Western Music in Nineteenth-century Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUEa8d-lTLEC&amp;pg=PA31|year=2007|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-259-4|pages=31–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Javanese week.jpg|thumb|Javanese signs for the [[Javanese calendar|five days of the week]], engraving by [[William Home Lizars]] from Crawfurd's ''History of the Indian Archipelago''.]]
Crawfurd was sent on diplomatic missions to [[Bali]] and the Celebes (now [[Sulawesi]]). His knowledge of the local culture supported Raffles's government in Java. Raffles, however, wanted to introduce land reform in the [[Cheribon]] residency. Crawfurd, with his experience of India and the ''[[zamindari]]'', was a supporter of the "village system" of revenue collection. He opposed Raffles's attempts to introduce individual (''[[ryotwari]]'') settlement into Java.&lt;ref&gt;Bastin, John. "Malayan Portraits: John Crawfurd", in ''Malaya'', vol.3 (December 1954), pp.697–698.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomat==
Java was returned to the Dutch in 1816, and Crawfurd went back to England that year, shortly becoming a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], and turning to writing.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=6651|title=Crawfurd, John|first=C. M.|last=Turnbull}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years he was recalled to South-East Asia, as a diplomat; his missions were of limited obvious success.

===Mission to Siam and Cochin China===
[[File:View of the city of Bangkok 1822.jpg|thumb|View of the city of Bangkok; from "Journal of an embassy from the governor-general of India to the courts of Siam and Cochin China"]]
In 1821, the then [[Governor-General of India]], [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings]], sent Crawfurd to the courts of [[History of Thailand|Siam]] (now [[Thailand]]) and [[Cochinchina#Pre-colonial history|Cochinchina]] (now [[Vietnam]].) Lord Hastings was especially interested in learning more about Siamese policy with regard to the northern [[Malay states#Monarchies by state|Malay states]], and [[Minh Mạng#Isolationist foreign policy|Cochinchina's policy]] with regard to [[France-Asia relations#Napoleon.27s Asian venture|French efforts to establish a presence in Asia]].    
Crawfurd travelled with notes from [[Horace Hayman Wilson]] on [[Buddhism]], as it was understood at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Almond, Philip C. |title=The British Discovery of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qj3zdIeEVNIC&amp;pg=PA11|date= 1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-35503-2|pages=11–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Captain Dangerfield of the [[Presidency armies|Indian army]], a skilful astronomer, surveyor and geologist, served as assistant; Lieutenant Rutherford commanded thirty [[Sepoy]]s; noted [[naturalist]] [[George Finlayson]] served as [[Royal Army Medical Corps|medical officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=9468|title=Finlayson, George|first=Giles|last=Hudson}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Crawfurd#Family|Mrs. Crawfurd]] accompanied the Mission.

21 November 1821, the mission embarked on the ''[[John Adam (administrator)#The John Adam|John Adam]]'' for the [[Hooghly river#Hooghly tidal bore|complicated and difficult navigation of the Hoogly]] river, taking  seven days to sail the 140 miles (225&amp;nbsp;km.) from [[Calcutta]] to open water. Crawfurd writes that, with the assistance of a steam-boat, ships might be towed down in two days without difficulty; then adds in a footnote: "The first steam-vessel used in India, was built about three years after this passage was written...."

The ''John Adam'' proceeded on what would be the first official visit to Siam since the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–1767)#Resurgent Siam|resurgence of Siam following the Burmese–Siamese War of 1765–1767]]. Crawfurd soon found the court of King [[Buddha Loetla Nabhalai|Rama II]] still embroiled in the aftermath of the [[Burmese–Siamese wars#Konbaung.E2.80.93Bangkok|Burmese–Siamese War]] of 1809–1812. On 8 December 1821, near Papra Strait (modern Pak Prah Strait north of [[Thalang District]]) Crawfurd finds fishermen "in a state of perpetual distrust and insecurity" due to territorial disputes between hostile [[Bamar people|Burmans]] and Siamese. 11 December, after entering the [[Straits of Malacca]] and arrival at [[Penang Island]], he finds the settlements of [[British Malaya#Penang and Kedah|Penang and Queda]] (modern [[Kedah Sultanate]], founded in 1136, but then a [[tributary state]] of Siam) in a state of alarm. [[Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II]], the [[Rajah]] of Quedah had fled the Rajah of Ligor (modern [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]) to claim [[right of asylum]] at Prince of Wales's Island (modern Penang.) British claim to the island was based upon payment of a [[quit-rent]] accordant with European feudal law, which Crawfurd feared the Siamese would challenge.

Crawfurd's journal entry for 1 April 1822, notes that the Siamese, for their part, were especially interested in the acquisition of arms. Pointedly questioned in this regard in a urgent private meeting with the [[Phra Klang|Prah-klang]] (future [[Rama III]]), the reply was, "that if the Siamese were at peace with the friends and neighbours of the British nation, they would certainly be permitted to purchase fire-arms and ammunition at our ports, but not otherwise." On 19 May, a Chief of Lao  ([[Anouvong|Chao Anu]], a king in what is now [[Laos]] and [[Chao Anu Rebellion|soon-to-be rebel]]) met with Crawfurd, a first diplomatic contact for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Crawfurd |first= John |title= Journal of an embassy from the governor-general of India to the courts of Siam and Cochin China|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sAUPAAAAYAAJ&amp;oe=UTF-8|volume= 1|date=  2006 |origyear= 1830 |publisher= H.

|quote= May 19. .... In the afternoon I had a visit from a native chief; a circumstance which did not often take place, for our vicinity to the Prah-klang's house, and the fear of exciting the jealousy of the Government, prevented many persons from calling upon us, who were otherwise well disposed to do so. The manners of this individual, who was a native of Lao, were singular.

===Resident of Singapore===
[[File:View of the town and roads of Singapore from the government hill published 1828.jpg|thumb|View of the town and roads of Singapore from the government hill]]
Crawfurd was appointed British [[Resident of Singapore]] in March 1823. He was under orders to reduce the expenditure on the existing [[factory (trading post)|factory]] there, but instead responded to local commercial representations, and spent money on reclamation work on the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dobbs, Stephen |title=The Singapore River: A Social History, 1819–2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O_yctUunNlMC&amp;pg=PA25|date= 2003|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=978-9971-69-277-3|pages=25–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also concluded the final agreement between the East India Company, and Sultan [[Hussein Shah of Johor]] with the [[Temenggong]], on the status of Singapore on 2 August 1824.

Crawfurd was on familiar terms with [[Munshi Abdullah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gladney, Dru C. |title=Making Majorities: Constituting the Nation in Japan, Korea, China, Malaysia, Fiji, Turkey, and the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ou3IgwlRQIcC&amp;pg=PA155+|year=1998|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3048-8|pages=155–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited and contributed to the ''[[Singapore Chronicle]]'' of Francis James Bernard, the first local newspaper that initially appeared dated 1 January 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seow, Francis T. |title=The Media Enthralled: Singapore Revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnZjYJ3TduUC&amp;pg=PA6|year=1998|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=978-1-55587-779-8|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford Street {{sic}} and Crawford Bridge {{sic}}  in Singapore are named after him.&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;

===Burma mission===
[[File:Steam Vessel Diana.jpg|thumb|left|The [[HMS Diana (1823)|''Diana'']].]]
Crawfurd was sent on another envoy mission to [[Burma]] in 1826, by Hastings's successor [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]], in the aftermath of the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. It was to be his last political service for the Company. The party included [[Adoniram Judson]] as interpreter and [[Nathaniel Wallich]] as botanist. Crawfurd's journey to [[Inwa|Ava]] up the [[River Irrawaddy]] was by [[paddle steamer]], the [[HMS Diana (1823)|''Diana'']]: it had been hired by the East India Company for the war, where it had seen action and travelled 400 miles up the Irrawaddy. There were five local boats, and soldiers making up a party of over 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/sbbr/editions/file64404.pdf |title=Journal of An Embassy From the Governor- General of India to the Court of Ava |journal=SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research|volume=

Crawfurd at the court found [[Bagyidaw]] temporising despite a weak position with the British forces in [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] and [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]]. The king conceded only a trade agreement, in return for a delay in indemnity payments; and sent his own mission to [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chandler, David Porter |author2=Steinberg, David Joel |title=In Search of Southeast Asia: A Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jzUz9lKn6PEC&amp;pg=PA105+|date= 1987|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1110-5|pages=105–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition fortuitously was delayed on the return journey for repairs. Crawfurd collected significant fossils, north of [[Magway, Burma|Magwe]] on the left bank of the river, in seven chests. Back in London, [[William Clift]] identified a new species of mastodon (more accurately [[Stegolophodon]]) from them;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rudwick, Martin J.

==Later life==
In the United Kingdom, Crawfurd spent around 40 years in varied activities. He wrote as an orientalist, geographer and ethnologist. He tried parliamentary politics, without success; he agitated for [[free trade]]; and he was a publicist for and against colonisation schemes, in line with his views. He also represented the interests of British traders based in Singapore and Calcutta.

===Radical parliamentary candidate===
Crawfurd made several unsuccessful attempts to enter the British Parliament in the 1830s. His campaign literature featured [[universal suffrage]] and the [[secret ballot]], [[free trade]] and opposition to [[monopolies]], [[public education]] and reduction of military spending, and opposition to [[regressive taxation]] and the taxation of [[Dissenters]] for a [[state church]], with nationalisation of [[Church of England]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellingson|Ellingson]], p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Parliamentary Candidate Society, founded by [[Thomas Erskine Perry]] (his brother-in-law), to promote "fit and proper" Members of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, D.J. (editor) (1970) [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=39481 "Papers relating to the Parliamentary Candidates Society"], in ''London Radicalism 1830–1843: A selection of the papers of Francis Place''. pp. 15–25.&lt;/ref&gt; He also joined the [[Radical Club]], a breakaway from the [[National Political Union (UK)|National Political Union]] founded in 1833 by [[William Wallis (weaver)|William Wallis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=39491 The Radical Club, and other papers', London Radicalism 1830–1843: A selection of the papers of Francis Place (1970), pp. 119–134.

Crawfurd unsuccessfully contested, as an advanced radical, [[Glasgow (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow]] in 1832, [[Paisley (UK Parliament constituency)|Paisley]] in 1834, [[Stirling Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirling Burghs]] in 1835, and [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] in 1837.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Douglas, Robert Kennaway (1888) [[s:Crawfurd, John (DNB00)|"Crawfurd, John (1783–1868), orientalist"]] in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At Glasgow he polled fourth (there were two MPs for the borough), with [[Daniel Sandford (scholar)|Sir Daniel Sandford]] third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Royal kalendar and court and city register for England, Scotland, Ireland and the colonies: for the year 1833|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=seU9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA115|year=1833|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1834 it was Sandford who was elected at Paisley.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=24632|title=Sandford, Daniel Keyte|first= M.

On 31 January 1834 Crawfurd supported [[Thomas Perronet Thompson]] in a meeting agitating against the [[Corn Laws]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tait's Edinburgh Magazine]]'', March 1834, vol. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QggbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA140 p. 140].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Carlyle]] alluded, in notes on one of [[Jane Welsh Carlyle]]'s letters, to Crawfurd speaking at a radical meeting at the [[London Tavern]] set up by [[Charles Buller]] on 21 November 1834; in which he showed much more originality than [[John Arthur Roebuck]], but lost his thread.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carlyleletters.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/long/7/1/lt-18341121-JWC-MAC-01 carlyleletters.dukejournals.org, Thomas Carlyle's notes to a letter of Jane Carlyle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713005101/http://carlyleletters.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/long/7/1/lt-18341121-JWC-MAC-01 |date=13 July 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Preston in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1837|1837 general election]] Crawfurd had the Liberal nomination in a three-cornered fight for two seats, as [[Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood]] was regarded as a waverer by the Conservatives who ran [[Robert Townley Parker]] against him; but he polled third.&lt;ref&gt;Clemesha, Henry Wordsworth (1912) ''A History of Preston in Amounderness'', [https://archive.org/stream/historyofpreston00clem#page/264/mode/2up p. 265].&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported [[John Temple Leader]]'s candidacy at Westminster against [[Sir Francis Burdett]], being deputy chairman on his election committee (with [[Thomas Prout]], chairman [[Sir Ronald Craufurd Ferguson]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Spectator]]'', 6 May 1837, vol. 10, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5zA_AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA429 p. 429].&lt;/ref&gt; Crawfurd spoke with [[George Grote]] at a meeting for Leader at the Belgrave Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Spectator]]'', 6 May 1837, vol. 10, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5zA_AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA415 p. 415].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free trader===
[[File:East Indiaman Asia.jpg|thumb|East Indiaman ''Asia'', 1836 painting by [[William John Huggins]].]]
A lifelong advocate of free trade policies, in ''A View of the Present State and Future Prospects of the Free Trade and Colonization of India'' (1829), Crawfurd made an extended case against the East India Company's approach, in particular in excluding British entrepreneurs, and in failing to develop Indian cotton. He had had experience in Java of the export possibilities for cotton textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Riello, Giorgio |author2=Roy, Tirthankar |title=How India Clothed the World: The World of South Asian Textiles, 1500–1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3jyp-LNHMAC&amp;pg=PA42|year=2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-17653-5|pages=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then gave evidence in March 1830 to a parliamentary committee, on the East India Company's monopoly of trade with China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain. Parliament. House of Commons. Select Committee on the East India Company|title=Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Affairs of the East India Company: China Trade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4sdMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA420-IA1+|year=1830|publisher=Parbury|page=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Montgomery Martin]] criticised Crawfurd, and the evidence of [[Robert Rickards]], an ex-employee of the Company,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/rickards-robert-1769-1836 "Rickards, Robert (1769–1836), of Sloane Street, Mdx."].

Crawfurd put out a pamphlet, ''Chinese Monopoly Examined''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin, Robert Montgomery |title=British relations with the Chinese empire in 1832: comparative statement of the English and American trade with India and Canton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KK-EnguHkMC&amp;pg=PA114|year=1832|pages=114–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ross Donnelly Mangles]] defended the East India Company in 1830, in an answer addressed to Rickards and Crawfurd.&lt;ref&gt;Carlyle, E. I. (1901) [[s:Mangles, Ross Donnelly (DNB01)|"Mangles, Ross Donnelly (1801–1877), chairman of the East India Company"]] in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Company's charter came up for renewal in 1833, the China trade monopoly was broken. Crawfurd's part as parliamentary agent for interests in Calcutta had been paid (at £1500 per year); his publicity work had included facts for an ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' article written by another author.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Michael (1969) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QNo8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA175 Ch. VII "The Victory of the Free Traders"], pp. 175, 183–4 in ''British Trade and the Opening of China 1800–1842''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonisation of Australia===
In reviewing [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s ''New British Province of South Australia'', and subsequent writing in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', Crawfurd gave an opinion against systematic [[colonisation]]. He considered that abundant land and individual enterprise were the necessary elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Schueller, Malini Johar |author2=Watts, Edward |title=Messy Beginnings: Postcoloniality and Early American Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2gp5-fnlp88C&amp;pg=PA123+|year=2003|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3233-2|pages=123–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Robert Torrens]], who floated the South Australian Land Company, replied to the ''Westminster Review'' line in ''Colonization of South Australia'' (1835).&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/torrens-robert-2740 ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', Torrens, Robert (1780–1864)].&lt;/ref&gt; Part I of the book is a ''Letter'' to Crawfurd.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Torrens (economist)|Torrens, Robert]] (1835) ''Colonization of South Australia''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XS0ZAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843 Crawfurd gave evidence to the [[Colonial Office]] on [[Port Essington]], on the north coast of [[Australia]], to the effect that its climate made it unsuitable for settlement. He returned to the topic in a debate in 1858 on settlements on the [[Victoria River (Northern Territory)|Victoria River]], as had been suggested by [[Sir George Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stafford|Stafford]], p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He generally opposed [[Sir Roderick Murchison]]'s promotion of European colonisation of Australia, as far as it applied to the  north coast.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stafford|Stafford]], p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbyist for South and South-East Asia issues===
When the Stamp Act 1827 was passed, meaning that all public documents in India would have to pay a [[stamp tax]] (including newspapers as well as legal documents), Crawfurd was hired as London agent for a group of British merchants in Calcutta opposing the legislation. Crawfurd involved [[Joseph Hume]], and he obtained newspaper coverage for his cause, including in ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'' where the precedents from America were cited. He also wrote pamphlets himself, in which he advocated an end to the East India Company monopoly, and European colonisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Burgess, Glenn |author2=Festenstein, Matthew |title=English Radicalism, 1550–1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bphx21x04SQC&amp;pg=PA298+|date= 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80017-4|pages=298–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These moves occurred in 1828–9; in 1830 Crawfurd approached [[William Huskisson]] directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Burgess, Glenn |author2=Festenstein, Matthew |title=English Radicalism, 1550–1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bphx21x04SQC&amp;pg=PA306 |date= 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80017-4|page=306 note 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lobbying continued with the free trade issues mentioned above. ''Inquiry into the System of Taxation in India, Letters on the Interior of India, an attack on the newspaper stamp-tax and the duty on paper entitled Taxes on Knowledge'' (1836) is a related work.

In 1855 Crawfurd went with a delegation to the [[President of the Board of Control|Board of Control]] of the East India Company, with representations on behalf of the [[Straits dollar]] as an independent currency. Crawfurd lobbied in both Houses of Parliament, with [[George Keppel, 6th Earl of Albemarle]] acting to bring a petition to the Lords, and [[William Ewart Gladstone]] putting the case in the Commons. Among the arguments put was that the dollar was a [[decimal currency]], while the [[rupee]] used by traders, and [[legal tender]] in East India Company territories since it was coined in 1835, was not. In 1856 a Bill to change the status quo on coins minted and issued from India was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Charles Burton (1902)  [https://archive.org/stream/ananecdotalhist01buckgoog#page/n206/mode/2up/ ''An Anecdotal History of Old Times in Singapore''], vol. 2, pp. 596–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868 Crawfurd with James Guthrie and William Paterson formed the [[Straits Settlements Association]], to protect the colony's interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Webster, Anthony |title=Gentleman Capitalists: British Imperialism in Southeast Asia 1770–1890|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vH2ssfXKBLwC&amp;pg=PA171|date=1998|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-171-8|pages=171–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawfurd was its first President.

==Last years==
He was elected President of the [[Ethnological Society]] in 1861. He died at his home in Elvaston Place, [[South Kensington]], London on 11 May 1868 at the age of 85.&lt;ref name=IllustTimes /&gt;

==Works==
Crawfurd wrote prolifically. His views have been seen as inconsistent: a recent author wrote that "[...] Crawfurd seemed to embody a complex mixture of elements of coexisting but ultimately contradictory value systems".&lt;ref name=Ellingson&gt;[[#Ellingson|Ellingson]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; A comment about "hasty general opinions from a few instances", by [[George Bennett (naturalist)|George Bennett]] on the topic of [[Papuan people]], has been taken to be aimed at Crawfurd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epress.anu.edu.au/foreign_bodies/pdf/whole_book.pdf Bronwen Douglas and Chris Ballard (editors), ''Foreign Bodies: Oceania and the Science of Race 1750–1940'', p. 200 note 58 (PDF)].&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1822 work ''"Malay of Champa"'' contain a vocabulary of the [[Cham language]].

===Diplomat and traveller===
In retirement after the Burmese mission, Crawfurd wrote books and papers on Eastern subjects. His envoy experiences from missions were written up in ''Journals'' in 1828 and 1829. This documentation was reprinted nearly 140 years later by Oxford University Press.

According to Jane Rendall's concept of "[[Scottish orientalism]]", Crawfurd is a historian of the second generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Powell, Avril Ann |title=Scottish Orientalists and India: The Muir Brothers, Religion, Education and Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PigNbvV9UxgC&amp;pg=PA152|year=2010|publisher=Boydell|isbn=978-1-84383-579-0|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''History of the Indian Archipelago'' (1820), in three volumes, was his major work. Crawfurd was a critic of much of what the European nations had done in the area of Asia he covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Boon, James A. |title=Affinities and Extremes: Crisscrossing the Bittersweet Ethnology of East Indies History, Hindu-Balinese Culture, and Indo-European Allure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjJjE2hpLMcC&amp;pg=PA30|date=1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-06461-1|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''An Historical and Descriptive Account of China'' (1836) was a joint work in three volumes from the ''[[Edinburgh Cabinet Library]]'', with [[Hugh Murray (geographer)|Hugh Murray]], Peter Gordon, [[Thomas Lynn]], [[William Wallace (mathematician)|William Wallace]], and [[Gilbert Thomas Burnett]].

===Orientalist===
*''Grammar and Dictionary of the Malay Language'' (1852)
Crawfurd and [[Colin Mackenzie]] collected manuscripts from the capture of Yogyakarta, and some of these are now in the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelplang/javanese/javacols/ British Library, ''Javanese and Old Javanese language collections'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawfurd claimed [[Cham language|Cham]] for the [[Austronesian languages]]. His suggestion met no favour at the time, but scholars from around 1950 onwards came to agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adelaar, K. Alexander |author2=Himmelmann, Nikolaus |title=The Austronesian Languages of Asia and Madagascar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5i1aMcmLWlMC&amp;pg=PA489|date=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1286-1|pages=489–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economist===
Crawfurd held strong views on what he saw as the backwardness of the economy of India of his time. He attributed it to the weakness of Indian financial institutions, compared to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chaudhuri, K. N. |title=The Economic Development of India Under the East India Company 1814–58: A Selection of Contemporary Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kjTPGW7ij4oC&amp;pg=PA4|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-15336-2|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opinions were in an anonymous pamphlet ''A Sketch of the Commercial Resources and Monetary and Mercantile System of British India'' (1837) now attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chaudhuri, K. N. |title=The Economic Development of India Under the East India Company 1814–58: A Selection of Contemporary Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kjTPGW7ij4oC&amp;pg=PA15|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-15336-2|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Robert Montgomery Martin]], he saw India primarily as a source of raw materials, and advocated investment based on that direction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kling|Kling]], p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; A harsh critic of the existing Calcutta agencies, he noted the absence of [[bill broking]] in India and suggested that an exchange bank should be set up.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kling|Kling]], p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

His view that an economy dominated by agriculture was inevitably an [[absolute government]] was cited by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in his ''[[On the Constitution of the Church and State]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], John Colmer (editor), ''On the Constitution of the Church and State'' (1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=AHY9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89 p. 89].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnologist===
While Crawfurd produced work that was ethnological in nature over a period of half a century, the term "[[ethnology]]" had not even been coined when he began to write. Attention has been drawn to his latest work, from the 1860s, which was copious. It met much criticism at the time, and has also been scrutinised in the 21st century.

====Polygenist====
Crawfurd held [[polygenist]] views, based on multiple origins of human groups; and these earned him, according to [[Sir John Bowring]], the nickname "the inventor of forty Adams".&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiographical Recollections of Sir John Bowring'' (1877), [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924104095462#page/n227/mode/2up p. 214].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]], Crawfurd is cited as believing in 60 races.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1874) "[[s:The Descent of Man (Darwin)/Chapter VII|Chapter VII: On the Races of Man]]" in ''Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex''&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed these views to the [[Ethnological Society of London]] (ESL), a traditional stronghold of [[monogenism]] (belief in a unified origin of humankind) where he had come in 1861 to hold office as President.

Crawfurd believed in different races as separate creations by God in specific regional zones, with separate origins for languages, and possibly as different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Livingstone, David N. |title=Adam's Ancestors: Race, Religion, and the Politics of Human Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LhkVM1I-2EC&amp;pg=PA113|date=2008|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8813-7|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Robert Gordon Latham]] of the ESL, he also opposed strongly the ideas of [[Max Müller]] on an original [[Aryan race]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beasley|Beasley]], p. 188 note 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Papers of the 1860s====
Crawford wrote in 1861 in the ''Transactions'' of the ESL a paper ''On the Conditions Which Favour, Retard, and Obstruct the Early Civilization of Man'', in which he argued for deficiencies in the science and technology of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adas|Adas]], p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''On the Numerals as Evidence of the Progress of Civilization'' (1863) he argued that the social condition of a people correlates with the numeral words of their language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Robson, Eleanor |editor2=Stedall, Jacqueline|author=Chrisomalis, Stephen |chapter=The Cognitive and Cultural Foundations of Numbers|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIMiWHVKLDkC&amp;pg=PR2-IA518|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-160744-8|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawfurd used [[domestication]] frequently as a metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellingson|Ellingson]], p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; His racist views on [[black people]] were laughed at, during the [[British Association]] meeting at [[Birmingham]] in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beasley|Beasley]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=June 2013}}

A paper by Crawfurd, ''On the Physical and Mental Characteristics of European and Asian Races of Man'', given 13 February 1866, argued for the superiority of Europeans. It particularly laid emphasis on European military dominance as evidence. Its thesis was directly contradicted at a meeting of the Society some weeks later, by [[Dadabhai Naoroji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Koditschek, Theodore|title=Liberalism, Imperialism, and the Historical Imagination: Nineteenth-Century Visions of a Greater Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heOq2CIzEtAC&amp;pg=PA263|date= 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49488-5|pages=263–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adas|Adas]], p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Analyses of Crawfurd's Racial Views ====
Recent analyses have sought to clarify Crawfurd's agenda in his writings on race and, at this time, when he had become prominent in a young and still fluid field and discipline. Ellingson demonstrates Crawfurd's role in promoting the idea of the [[noble savage]] in service of racial ideology. Trosper has taken Ellingson's analysis a step further, attributing to Crawfurd a conscious "spin" put on the idea of primitive culture, a rhetorically sophisticated use of a "[[straw man]]" fallacy, achieved by bringing in, irrelevantly but for the sake of incongruity, the figure of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Trosper, Ronald |title=Resilience, Reciprocity and Ecological Economics: Northwest Coast Sustainability|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ra92KfIBxfcC&amp;pg=PA29|date=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-88199-6|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawfurd dedicated considerable effort to a critique of Darwin's theories of [[human evolution]]; as a proponent of [[polygenism]], who believed that human races did not share common ancestors, Crawfurd was an early and prominent critic of Darwin's ideas .&lt;ref name="Google Books"&gt;[[#Ellingson|Ellingson]], p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Right at the end of his life, in 1868, Crawfurd was using a "[[transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]]" argument against [[Sir John Lubbock]], in what Ellingson describes as a misrepresentation of a Darwinist viewpoint based on the idea that a precursor of humans must still be extant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellingson|Ellingson]], p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellingson points to a work of [[William Falconer (physician)|William Falconer]], ''On the Influence of Climate'' from 1781, with an attack on Rousseau, as a possible source of Crawfurd's thinking; while also pointing out some differences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellingson|Ellingson]], p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellingson also places Crawfurd in a British group among those of his period whose anthropological views not only turned on [[race (classification of humans)|race]], but who also drew conclusions of superiority from those views, others being [[Luke Burke]], [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]], [[Robert Knox]], and [[Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellingson|Ellingson]], p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawfurd's attitudes were not, however, based on [[human skin colour]];&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellingson|Ellingson]], p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was an opponent of slavery,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stocking, Jr.]], ''Victorian Anthropology'' (1987), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; having written an article "Sugar without Slavery" with Thomas Perronet Thompson in 1833 in the ''Westminster Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, Michael J. |title=Independent Radicalism in Early Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OwvBVOEGDQwC&amp;pg=PA195|date=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97386-5|pages=195–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Bentham, Jeremy |editor2=Bowring, John |editor3=Mill, John Stuart |title=The Westminster Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYMVAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA247+|year=1833|publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|pages=247–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dismissing Crawfurd's notes and suggestions on his work as "quite unimportant", Charles Darwin identified Crawfurd's racial views as "Pallasian", i.e. the analogue for humankind of the theories of [[Peter Simon Pallas]].&lt;ref name="Google Books"/&gt;

The predominant approach in the ESL went back to [[James Cowles Prichard]]. In the view of [[Thomas Trautmann]], in Crawfurd's attack on the Aryan theory there is a final rejection of the "languages and nations" approach, which was Prichard's, and a consequent freeing of (polygenist) racial theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Trautmann, Thomas R. |title=Languages and Nations: The Dravidian Proof in Colonial Madras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0W0oVIZgyEwC&amp;pg=PA223|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24455-9|pages=223–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Crawfurd married Horatia Ann, daughter of [[James Perry (journalist)|James Perry]]. From 1821 to 1822, Mrs. Crawfurd had accompanied the [[#Mission to Siam and Cochin China|Mission to Siam and Cochin China]] aboard the ''John Adam''. As the ship made way from Bangkok to Hué, Mrs. Crawfurd went ashore on an island in the Gulf of Siam, where she made a considerable impression upon the natives.&lt;ref name = "Finl"&gt;{{cite book

|quote= .... Mrs. Crawfurd had accompanied [270]us to the village, and her presence conferred a degree of interest upon the scene not easy to be described. The men, stupid with wonder, seemed to look upon her as a being of another creation; and indeed, if we cast our eyes upon the contrast in the female forms now before us, their wonder will not appear surprising, and these rude and wretched savages might well doubt that they had but little connexion with our race. Never, perhaps, was savage life more strikingly contrasted with refined; an accomplished female, brought up in all the elegance and refinement of the first metropolis in the world, stood opposed to the rude, scarce human forms of the savage islanders of the Gulf of Siam!

'''Kuttanad''' is a region covering the Alappuzha and Kottayam Districts, in the state of [[Kerala]], India, well known for its vast paddy fields and geographical peculiarities. The region has the lowest altitude in India, and is one of the few places in the world where farming is carried around {{convert|4|to|10|ft|m|order=flip}} below sea level. Kuttanadu is historically important in the ancient history of South India and is the major rice producer in the state. 
Farmers of Kuttinad are famous for Biosaline Farming. FAO has declared the Kuttanad Farming System as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS).
Four of Kerala's major rivers, the [[Pamba River|Pamba]], [[Meenachil River|Meenachil]], [[Achankovil]] and [[Manimala]] flow into the region. It is well known for its boat race in the Punnamada Backwaters, known in Malayalam as [[Vallamkalli]].

== History ==
This land had been the source of food to Changanacherry market. Later it had been allocated to Allapuzha district on the basis of landscape.
The first recorded history on the origin of this land is obtained from [[Sangam period]] literature.  Additionally the oral history among local people, transferred from generation to generation is a blend of myths and legends is a valuable resource. According to Sangam era documents, '''Uthiyan Cheralatan''' ('''Perum Chorru Udiyan Cheralathan''' , '''Athan I'''), or Udiyanjeral (AD first century''.'') is the first recorded [[Chera|Chera dynasty]] ruler of the [[Sangam period]] in ancient [[South India]].{{sfn|Singh|2008|p=384}}&lt;ref name="sen2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had his capital at a place called Kuzhumur in Kuttanad (central [[Kerala]]) and expanded the kingdom northward and eastward from his original homeland. His lifetime is broadly determined to be between first century BC and 2nd century AD. His queen was Veliyan Nallini, the daughter of Veliyan Venman. [[Uthiyan Cheralathan]] was a contemporary of the Chola ruler [[Karikala Chola]]. He is praised for his elephant corps and cavalry. Present day Changanacherry end of Kuttanad was the capital of the [[Chera]] dynasty king [[Uthiyan Keralathan|Uthiyan_Cheralathan]]. His descendant was [[Senguttavan]] (Chenguttavan means "brave-hearted" in [[malayalam]] and his name is carried by the next towns of [[Chenganacherri]] and [[Chengana]] to the present day). According to sangam literature, [[Cheralathan]] was defeated in the [[Battle of Venni]] with Karikala [[Chola]] and the capital was burnt down.  Another local legend says Kuttanad was believed to be forest with dense tree growth.  This forest was destroyed subsequently by a wild fire.

It is a well known fact that burned black wooden logs were mined from paddy fields called as ‘Karinilam’(Black paddy fields) until the recent past. This fact throws some light on this theory of Chuttanad evolving to Kuttanad. In Kuttanad most of the place names end in kari (meaning burnt residue or charcoal). Some familiar place names are Ramankary, Puthukkary, Amichakary, Oorukkary, Mithrakary, Mampuzhakary, [[Kainakary]], [[Kandankary|Kandanakary]], Thayamkary, [[Chathenkary]], Chathurthiakary and [[Chennamkary]].

== Divisions ==

The Kuttanad region is categorised into:
* [[Lower Kuttanad]]
* [[Upper Kuttanad]]
* [[North Kuttanad]]

Lower Kuttanadu comprises taluks of [[Ambalapuzha]], Kuttanadu (excluding [[Edathua]], [[Thalavady]] and [[Muttar]], and the northern half of [[Karthikapally]] taluk in [[Alappuzha district]]).

Upper Kuttanad comprises [[Veeyapuram]] and [[Pallippad]] in [[Karthikapally]] taluk, [[Edathua]], [[Thalavady]], [[Kidangara]] and [[Muttar]] in [[Kuttanad taluk]]; [[Chennithala]] village in [[Mavelikkara]], [[Mannar, India|Mannar]], [[Kuruttissery]], [[Budhanur]], [[Ennakkad]] villages in [[Chengannur taluk]] of [[Alappuzha district]]; and [[Parumala]], [[Kadapra]], [[Niranam]], [[Pulikeezhu]], [[chathenkary]] ,Nedumpuram, villages in [[Pathanamthitta district]].

North Kuttanad comprises [[Vaikom]] taluk, western parts of [[Kottayam]] taluk, and western parts of [[Changanacherry]] taluk in [[Kottayam district]].

== Villages ==

A few of the major villages which form Kuttanad are: [[Kainakary]], [[Chathenkary]] Ramankar[[Ramankary|y]], Puthukkary, [[Chennamkary]], [[Nedumudi]], [[Niranam]], [[Kaipuzha]], [[Edathua]], [[Mampuzhakkary]], [[Neelamperoor]], [[Kainady]], [[Kavalam]], [[Pulincunnoo]], [[Manalady]], [[Kannady]] Kayalpuram, [[Veliyanadu]], Veeyapuram, Vezhapra, [[Kunnamkary]], [[Kumaramkary]], [[Valady]], [[Kidangara]], [[Mithrakary]], [[Muttar]], [[Neerattupuram]], [[Thalavadi]], [[Changankary]], [[Champakulam]], [[Nedumudi]], [[Moonnatummukham]], [[Melpadom]], [[Pulincunnu]], [[Pallippad]], 
[[Payippad]], [[Karichal]], [[Ayaparambu]], [[Anary]], [[Vellamkulangara]], [[Pilappuzha]], [[Pandi, Kerala|Pandi]], [[Edathua]], [[Pacha, India|Pacha]], [[Chekkidikad]], [[Thakazhy]], [[Cheruthana]], [[Karuvatta]], [[Chennithala]], [[Narakathara]], [[Venattukad]], [[Kayalppuram]], [[Mankompu]], [[Chathurthiakary]], [[Koduppunna]], [[Oorukkary]], [[Thayankary]], [[Thiruvarpu]], [[Pullangadi]] and [[payattupakka]], [[Kandankary]] among others.

== Backwater paddy cultivation (kayal cultivation) ==
[[File:Kerala Kuttanad2.jpg|thumb|Paddy fields in Kuttanad]]

The major occupation in Kuttanadu is farming, with rice the most important agricultural product. This activity gives the area its moniker of "The Rice Bowl of Kerala". Three crops are grown every year now instead of the traditional practice of two crops per year. Large farming areas near [[Vembanad Lake]] were reclaimed from the lake. The history of paddy cultivation in Kuttanad can be traced back centuries. The evolution of paddy cultivation correlated with technological advancement and changes in the regulatory framework that existed during the 19th and 20th centuries. In earlier times, reclamation was carried out mainly from the shallow part of the Vembanad Lake or from the periphery of the [[Pamba River]]. These reclamations constituted small areas of paddy fields called ''padasekharams''. Bailing out of water from the fields were done manually using water wheels called ''chakram''. Gradually the manual method used for bailing out of water gave way to steam engines.

There were robberies in Kuttanad in earlier days, which were prohibited by the Travancore Maharajah [[Moolam Thirunal]].

Three distinct stages can be identified in the reclamation of kayal lands from the lake. The first stage was carried out by private entrepreneurs without any financial support from the government. The Pattom Proclamation made by the Travencore Kingdom in 1865, gave a great fillip to reclamation activities between 1865 and 1888. During this period de-watering of the polders was done manually using ''chakram'', which restricted large-scale reclamation. Only about 250 hectares of land were reclaimed during this period. Venadu kayal and Madathil Kayal were reclaimed during this period and are considered the first "Kayal Nilams" to be reclaimed from the Vembanad Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The second phase started during 1888. One of the reclamation during this period was undertaken by Chalayil Eravi Kesava Panicker.  He chose to reclaim Vembanad kayal from the mouth of the Chennamkari river as it joins with the back waters.  The reclaimed kayal was known as ‘ Attumuttu Kayal’. Other major reclamation on the same year was Seminary Kayal which was undertaken by Kottayam Orthodox Seminary.

The introduction of kerosene engines for dewatering resulted in the reclamation of wider areas of the lake for cultivation. This made farmers consider venturing into the deeper parts of the lake. During the period between 1898 and 1903, reclamation activity was led by [[Pallithanam Luka Mathai]] (alias Pallithanathu Mathaichen) who reclaimed the [[Cherukara Kayal]] and Pallithanam Moovayiram Kayal. But the second phase (1890 to 1903) of reclamation activities came to a halt because of the ban on kayal reclamation imposed by the Madras Government in 1903. Cherukali Kayal, Rajapuram Kayal, Aarupanku Kayal, Pantharndu Panku kayal and Mathi Kayal were the other major reclamations during this period.

In 1912, the Madras Government approved a proposal from the Travancore Government for further reclamations in three stages. Under this scheme kayal land was notified for reclamation in blocks each named with a letter of the English alphabet. Out of the total area of 19,500 acres of kayal land, 12,000 acres were reclaimed between 1913 and 1920. After the removal of the ban in 1913, [[Pallithanam Luca Matthai]] along with some other prominent families in Kuttanadu, reclaimed E-Block Kayal measuring a total area 2,400 acres. This is the biggest kayal nilam in Kuttanadu. C.J. Kurian, Ex MLC and Mr. John Illikalam were his main partners in this venture. The reclamations between 1914 and 1920, known as the new reclamations,  were carried out in three periods. In the first period Blocks A to G measuring 6300 Acres were reclaimed. C Block, D Block(Attumukham Aarayiram (Attumuttu Kayal), Thekke Aarayiram and Vadakke Aarayiram) and E Block (Erupathinalayiram Kayal) F Block (Judge's Aarayiram Kayal) and G Block (Kochu Kayal) are the major Kayal nilams reclaimed during this period.

During the second period of new reclamation, blocks H to N covering an area of 3600 acres were reclaimed under the leadership of [[Pallithanam Luca Matthai]], Cunnumpurathu Kurien, Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Kunnathusseril Peious, Ettuparayil Xavier and Pattassery PP Mathai. During the third period of new reclamation, R Block Kayal covering 1,400 acres was reclaimed by the joint efforts of eight families led by then member of Sree Moolam Popular Assembly, [[Pallithanam Luca Matthai]]. His partners in the reclamation included Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Ettuparayil Xavier, Pattassery PP Mathai, Meledom, Paruthickal and Kandakudy.

From 1920 to 1940 reclamation activity came to a halt because of a steep drop in the price of rice.
[[File:Kuttanad beauty.jpg|alt=Kuttanad beauty|thumb|'''Kuttanad beauty''']]

[[File:Rice fields of Kuttanad.jpg|thumb|left|Farmers using traditional water turbines in a rice field]]
Due to the steep decline in the price of rice between 1920 and 1940 reclamation activities slowed down, but they gained momentum again in the early 1940s. During this period, in order to increase agricultural output, a government initiated "Grow More Food" campaiagn and the provision of incentives encouraged new reclamations. The advent of electric motors made reclamation relatively easier, cheaper and less risky as compared to in earlier periods. The last tract of the reclamations namely Q, S and T block were made during this period by Thomman Joseph Murickummoottil (Muricken Outhachan).

[[File:Kuttanad kerala.jpg|alt=Kuttanad kerala|thumb|'''Kuttanad kerala''']]
As farming in the area increased, farmers felt themselves constrained by the two cycles a year for rice cultivation. The reason for which is the limited availability of potable water in Kuttanadu. During the monsoon seasons, the water from the mountains flow through the rivers to the sea, bringing potable water to Kuttanadu. But during summer, due to the low level of the region seawater enters Kuttanadu, significantly increasing the salinity of the water and making it unpotable.

Also Kuttanad is recognised as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) by [[FAO]]

== Thottappilli Spillway ==
This project was designed as a permanent solution to the flood situation in Kuttanad. This programme was envisaged in such a way that flood waters from Pamba, Manimalayar and Achankovil were diverted to the sea before it reached Vembanad lake. The construction of the Spillway ended by 1959.

In 1968, the Government of India proposed that a bund ([[Dam]]) be made across the river so that seawater would not be allowed to come inside Kuttanad during summer, allowing farmers to cultivate an extra crop per year. The project was planned in three phases, the south side, the north side and another phase to join the two sections. The project was delayed and by the time the first two phases were complete the entire money allotted for the project ran out and left the final phase in limbo. The farmers who were expecting lots of financial benefits after the completion of the project decided to take matters into their own hands and one night in 1972, a large group of farmers filled the gap between the north and the south side with earth. To this day, the earth embankment between the two sections of the bund remains. With this, it was possible to close the regulator of shutters during December–June when the saline water enters, and then open it during monsoon. Once the Thanneermukkam bund and spillway became operational two crops were possible in Kuttanad.that are chambavu and karutha charu.

Even though the bund has improved the quality of life of the farmers, the bund is alleged to have caused severe environmental problems. The backwaters which were abundant with fish and part of the staple food of the people of the region require a small amount of salt water for its breeding. The bund has caused deterioration of fish varieties in the region and the fishermen opposed to the bund as of 2005. The bund has also disrupted the harmony of the sea with the backwaters and has caused problems not foreseen before the bund like the omniprescence of the water weeds. Earlier the salt water tends to cleanse the backwaters but this does not happen any more leading to the pollution of the backwaters and the entire land near by.

'''Land Surveying in Kentucky''' is the practice of [[Land Surveying]] in the Commonwealth of [[Kentucky]].

==Consumer Information==

=== Do I need a Survey? ===
It is a good idea to have a property survey:&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaps1.com/ The Kentucky Association of Professional Surveyors]: [http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf ''Land Surveyors and Their Profession''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135127/http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When buying, selling, investing in or developing property.
*If a boundary location is unknown or unclear.
*Before improvements are made (buildings, fences, excavation, etc.)
*To stop encroachments from adjoining owners.
*To establish easements and rights of way.
*When timber is cut near a property boundary line.
*When recommended by a lending institution.
*When dividing a large tract of land into a smaller tract or tracts.

===Type of Surveys===
Often a residential customer will request a Boundary Survey. A mortgage inspection is less expensive, but offers much less protection and value. ALTA/ACSM surveys in Kentucky are typically requested only for commercial activity.
*Boundary Survey: A boundary survey of the subject property will be made and the property corners will be located and verified or reset. The improvements on the property will be located and a check for violations or encroachments onto or from the subject property will be made. This survey may be used by the property owner for the construction of a fence or other improvement. Flood plain certification is restricted to a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Maps FIRM(latest revision), and shall not be construed as a confirmation or denial of flooding potential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.ky.gov/kar/201/018/150.htm 201 KAR 18:150]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mortgage Inspection: The sole purpose of this inspection is to obtain mortgage title insurance. This is the minimum service that your lender requires for closing your loan. It is a location of improvements and cursory check for violations or encroachments onto or from the subject property based on existing but not confirmed evidence. This does not constitute a boundary survey and is subject to any inaccuracies that a subsequent boundary survey may disclose; no property corners will be set; and, it should not be used or relied upon for the establishment of any fence, structure or other improvement. Flood plain certification is restricted to a review of the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) (latest revision), and shall not be construed as a confirmation or denial of flooding potential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.ky.gov/kar/201/018/200.htm 201 KAR 18:200]&lt;/ref&gt;
*ALTA/ACSM Survey: This is the most comprehensive type of survey and improvement location. It covers all the aspects of the boundary survey and improvement location and identification for any additional evidence of possession or use which could be adverse to the interest of the purchaser. This survey may include definitive statements regarding the flooding potential in addition to a review of Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM).

===Choosing a Surveyor===
Most land surveying work is acquired through the personal recommendation of satisfied clients, lending institutions, attorneys, real estate companies and title companies who frequently handle real estate transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaps1.com/ The Kentucky Association of Professional Surveyors]: [http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf ''Land Surveyors and Their Profession''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135127/http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of Kentucky's 120 [[County (United States)|counties]] elects a County Surveyor. However, a consumer can seek services from any licensed Kentucky Professional Land Surveyor. The status of a licensee or firm can be [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107181235/http://apps.kyboels.ky.gov/SearchableRoster.aspx verified online], including checking for [https://web.archive.org/web/20100204203736/http://apps.kyboels.ky.gov/DisciplinaryAction.aspx Disciplinary Actions] in the past 5 years. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107183408/http://kyboels.ky.gov/ConsumerInfo/MakingComplaint/ Formal complaints] against a Professional Land Surveyor should be made in writing to the [http://kyboels.ky.gov/ Kentucky Board of Engineers and Land Surveyors].

===Right of Entry===
Residents should be aware of the right of entry on land of others by a land surveyor, which include persons such as employees that are under the supervision of a Professional Land Surveyor. A professional land surveyor shall not be liable to arrest or a civil action by reason of this entry. No owner or occupant of the land shall be liable for any injury or damage sustained by any person entering upon his or her land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrc.ky.gov/KRS/322-00/470.PDF KRS 322.470]&lt;/ref&gt;

===State Regulation===
Land Surveying in Kentucky is regulated by the Commonwealth in [http://www.lrc.ky.gov/KRS/322-00/CHAPTER.HTM KRS 322]. The Standards of Practice are defined in [http://www.lrc.ky.gov/kar/201/018/150.htm 201 KAR 18:150]. Compliance is maintained by the [http://kyboels.ky.gov/ Kentucky Board of Engineers and Land Surveyors], which was established by an Act of the Kentucky General Assembly in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kyboels.ky.gov/ Kentucky Board of Engineers and Land Surveyors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land Systems in Kentucky==
All [[chain of title]] in the Commonwealth traces back to [[Virginia]] land patents and [[Kentucky]] land patents. The [http://www.sos.ky.gov/ Secretary of State] maintains the security and preservation of these historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.ky.gov/land/ Kentucky Land Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131063400/http://www.sos.ky.gov/land/ |date=2010-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent [[Deed]] and [[Plat]] records are maintained by Kentucky's [http://www.elect.ky.gov/countyclerks.htm County Clerks].

Most of the state utilizes the [[Metes and bounds]] land system, which is based on English [[Common Law]] and reflects the Commonwealth's original status as a part of [[Virginia]] until statehood in 1792. Parts of Western Kentucky, since it was acquired under the [[Jackson Purchase]] in 1818, utilizes a rectangular system based on the [[Public Land Survey System]] created by the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LPX8fBx67DQC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Public+Land+Survey+System%22+%22Western+Kentucky%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o-_4RqDJcc&amp;sig=HINgSLLp--UHNh9pWyYhXnvPG24&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ScxpS7q9M4raNdSKsY0G&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Public%20Land%20Survey%20System%22%20%22Western%20Kentucky%22&amp;f=false Charles J. Jacobus, ''Texas Real Estate'', pg. 21, 10th edition, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Units of Measure===
Common surveying measures in Kentucky include [[acre]] and the [[survey foot]], which are both now referenced in decimal and historically in fraction. For example, a modern survey should list a distance of one-foot and six-inches as 1.50 feet. Historically lengths were also measured as [[chain (length)]] and [[rod (length)]]. A rod is also known as a pole, both being 16.5 feet. A chain is most commonly 66 feet (4 poles) but can also be 33 feet (2 poles).

==History==
Notable Surveyors in Kentucky History include [[Daniel Boone]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Thomas Bullitt]], [[George Rogers Clark]], and [[Isaac Shelby]].

==Technology==
Modern technology used in surveying in Kentucky includes [[GPS]], the [[Total station]], and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]. A popular [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] system with Kentucky Surveyors is [http://www.carlsonsw.com Carlson Software], which is headquartered in [[Maysville, Kentucky]]. Surveying is also aided by the development of [[Geographic information systems]], such as [http://www.lojic.org LOJIC].

==Kentucky Association of Professional Surveyors (KAPS)==
[http://kaps1.com/ The Kentucky Association of Professional Surveys] (KAPS) maintains and perpetuates an organization for members having common professional problems and interests. The organization provides effective forums for discussion and united action on the part of its members for the enhancement and betterment of professional recognition, status and conditions of employment. KAPS also addresses other matters which contribute to the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, KAPS membership and State Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaps1.com/ The Kentucky Association of Professional Surveyors]: [http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf ''Land Surveyors and Their Profession''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135127/http://kaps1.com/images/brochure/kaps_brochure.pdf |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Flag of the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey.svg|thumb|260px|The Flag of the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey]]

The '''Lieutenant Governor of Jersey''' is the representative of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] in the [[Jersey|Bailiwick of Jersey]], a [[Crown dependency]] of the [[The Crown|British Crown]].

The Lieutenant Governor has his own flag in Jersey, the [[Union Jack|Union Flag]] defaced with the Bailiwick's coat of arms. The Lieutenant Governor's official residence ([[Government House, Jersey|Government House]]) in [[Saint Saviour, Jersey|St. Saviour]] was depicted on the [[Jersey pound|Jersey £50 note]] 1989–2010.

==Duties==
[[File:Jour d'la Libéthâtion Jèrri 9 d'Mai 2010 07.jpg|thumb|Liberation Day 2010: The Lieutenant Governor, having arrived in the Royal Square in his official car, greets the Bailiff of Jersey.]]
The duties are primarily diplomatic and ceremonial. The role of the Lieutenant Governor is to act as the ''[[de facto]]'' [[head of state]]  in Jersey. The Lieutenant Governor also liaises between the Governments of Jersey and the [[United Kingdom]]. The holder of this office is also ex officio a member of the [[States of Jersey]] but may not vote and, by convention, speaks in the Chamber only on appointment and on departure from post.

The Lieutenant Governor exercises certain executive functions relating broadly to citizenship (passports, deportation and nationality). [[Jersey passport]]s are British passports issued on behalf of the Lieutenant Governor, in the exercise of the [[royal prerogative]], through the Passport Office which the States fund and from which the States retain any revenue generated. [[Deportation]] from Jersey is ordered by the Lieutenant Governor. Certificates of [[naturalization]] as a British citizen are issued by the Lieutenant Governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyReports/2008/46527-24954-2762008.pdf |title=STATES OF JERSEY SECOND INTERIM REPORT OF THE CONSTITUTION REVIEW GROUP |website=statesassembly.gov.je |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Jean Hammond et William Sherbrooke Ramsay Norcott 1873.jpg|thumb|In this caricature of 1873, Bailiff of Jersey Jean Hammond greets newly arrived Lieutenant Governor Norcott]]
The office of Lieutenant Governor has its origins in the Norman administration of the Channel Islands. The functions of the [[bailiff (Channel Islands)|bailiff]] and the official who was later to become known as Lieutenant Governor (called variously, Warden or Captain) became separate in the aftermath of the division of Normandy in 1204. However, the respective responsibilities of the two officials were only clearly defined in the 17th century as a result of a power struggle between bailiff and governor. An Order in Council dated 18 February 1617 laid down that "the charge of military forces be wholly in the Governor, and the care of justice and civil affairs in the Bailiff"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/Oct99/cry_for_constitutional_reform.aspx The Cry For Constitutional Reform: A Perspective From The Office Of Bailiff, Philip Bailhache, 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003095548/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/Oct99/cry_for_constitutional_reform.aspx |date=3 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the monarchy was restored, King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] who had escaped to Jersey on his way to exile in France rewarded Jersey with the power to levy customs duties. This power, exercised by the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats, was finally taken over by the States of Jersey in 1921, thereby enabling the States to control the budget independently of the Lieutenant Governor.

The post of Governor of Jersey became a titular [[sinecure]], and a Lieutenant Governor was appointed to actually carry out the functions of the office. [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford]], was the last titular Governor of Jersey; since his death in 1856 the Crown has been formally and constitutionally represented in Jersey by the Lieutenant Governor.

The States of Jersey Law 2005 abolished any power of the Lieutenant Governor to veto a resolution of the States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f16%2f16.800_StatesofJerseyLaw2005_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm Laws in Force, Revised Edition, 1 January 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232313/http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F16%2F16.800_StatesofJerseyLaw2005_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 it was announced that the next Lieutenant Governor would be recommended to the Crown by a Jersey panel, thus replacing the previous system of the appointment being made by the Crown on the recommendation of UK ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/07/06/105000-%E2%80%93-the-tax-free-reward-for-being-a-royal-rep/ The tax from reward for being a Royal Representative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816020322/http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/07/06/105000-%E2%80%93-the-tax-free-reward-for-being-a-royal-rep/ |date=16 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisguernsey.com/2010/07/03/guernsey-will-choose-its-next-lt-governor/ Guernsey will chose its next Governor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813220348/http://www.thisisguernsey.com/2010/07/03/guernsey-will-choose-its-next-lt-governor/ |date=13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the small park [[Lillsjöparken]] and surrounded by heavily trafficked artery roads on all sides, it is rich in [[nutrient]]s with high levels of metals in the sediments.  Prospects are to improve the water quality to keep the lake as a locale for birds.&lt;ref name="lillsjön"&gt;Lillsjön&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment area ==
Lillsjön is a small and shallow lake connected to [[Ulvsundasjön]] through a channel, and the flow is periodically reversed with water pouring into the lake.  Half of the catchment area is composed of forest and open terrain, part of series of parks constituting a local recreational resource.  Heavily trafficked roads take up some 4 per cent and settlements (including [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment-gardens]]) approximately 20 per cent of the surface.  The lake is considered as of great recreational value but of moderate natural importance, except as a breeding locale for many fish species in [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]].  Motorboats are prohibited in the lake.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-8.1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-8.3"&gt;Vattenprogram, p. 8.3-8.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake is surrounded by the [[deciduous forest]] and lawns of the park Lillsjöparken.  Three allotment-gardens are found near the lake and 11 ha of the catchment area is occupied by one-family houses.  While the inflow from the surrounding area contributed some 200,000 m³ annually, even small variations in water level in Lake Mälaren are of greater importance.  Three major artery roads and a ground-level metro track stretches through the area of which [[Bromma Airport]] forms a minor part.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-8.3" /&gt;

=== Environmental influence ===
North and east of the lake are a petrol station and other operations considered as having a negative environmental impact.  Until the mid-1980s, the lake received considerable amounts of [[spillway]] overflow which resulted in high levels of [[coliform bacteria]].  A waste water accident in 1997 caused considerable amounts of polluted water to leak into the lake, but since 2001 waste water only reach the lake during longer periods with continuous rain.  Low levels of [[oxygen]] causes levels of [[phosphorus]] to rise in the bottom of the lake during winters and during summers when the lake is stratified.  Run-off water from surrounding roads reaches the lake through the ditch dug when the park was created. Most of the [[nitrogen]] and more than half of the phosphorus stems from settlements in the area, while allotments-gardens, generally lacking sewers, contributes with nutrients and industries and others operations contributes with [[zinc]] and [[copper]].  Sediments have high levels of copper and [[nickel]], and deeper sediments contain very high levels of [[organic compound]]s such as [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-8.3" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
In late summers, the lake is dominated by various [[cyanobacteria]]s.  The only [[zooplankton]] recorded are [[rotifer]]s.  No inventory of [[aquatic plant]]s have been made since 1976, but the lake shares are dominated by [[Phragmites|reed]] with [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]] found in the southern part.  Ten fish species were recorded in 1997-1998, including [[perch]], [[northern pike]], [[carp bream]], and [[Sander (genus)|pikeperch]].  [[Signal crayfish]] is occasionally found in the lake.  The most commonly breeding bird [[mallard]] is accompanied by [[Eurasian coot]] and [[great crested grebe]]. Several other species are found in the reeds, including [[reed warbler]] and [[reed bunting]], and many other regularly uses the lake as a stopover.  [[Common frog]] has been recorded in the lake.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-8.4"&gt;Vattenprogram, p. 8.4-8.6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visiting ==
While the lake by itself is mostly local interest, there are various historical structures in the surrounding area making it popular for promenades, including [[petroglyph]]s, [[runestone]]s, the 17th century [[Ulvsunda Palace]], and several 19th century mansions and other buildings considered of great local interest.  The nearest metro station is [[Abrahamsberg]].&lt;ref name="sevardheter"&gt;Sevärdheter&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian state of [[Tasmania]] has one of the longest traditions of cricket-playing in the southern hemisphere.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  [[Cricket]] is recorded as having first been played in [[Tasmania]] very shortly after the arrival of [[History of Tasmania#European arrival|British settlers]] on the island on 12 September 1803, however it wasn't until nearly fifty years later that [[First-class cricket]] was to be played there.

Despite the long wait since the foundation of the colony, [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]] played in the [[First first-class cricket match in Australia|first ever first-class cricket match in Australia]], which was played on 11 February and 12 February 1851, against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]], with [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]] emerging victorious by 3 wickets. For that first match, Tasmania was captained by [[John Marshall (cricketer, born 1796)|John Marshall]].

Following that first ever First-class match Tasmania endured a long period of isolation, in which the island's cricketers had to content themselves with occasional First-class matches against other colonies, primarily [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]], and touring or representative sides.

Australia's elite [[First-class cricket]] competition, the [[Sheffield Shield]] was established in 1892, however [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]] was not invited to participate in that elite competition until 1977, and even then, their first four seasons were on a limited fixture list.

These are '''lists of the men who have been the official Tasmanian captains in [[First-class cricket|First-class]], [[List A cricket|List A]] and [[Twenty20]] domestic matches.'''&lt;br /&gt; 
Where a player has a dagger ([[Dagger (typography)|†]]) after his period of captaincy, that denotes that player deputised for the appointed captain. The dagger classification follows that adopted by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]''.

==First-class captains==
This is a list of cricketers who have [[captain (cricket)|captained]] the [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmanian cricket team]] for at least one [[First-class cricket|First-class match]]. It is complete up to the 2018/19 season.

Notes:
* Where there are periods of time in which it appears there is no captain, it is because prior to Tasmania's entry into the [[Sheffield Shield]] they often went for periods in which the state played no first class cricket.
* [[Jack Simmons (cricketer)|Jack Simmons]] captained Tasmania to their first ever win in a [[Sheffield Shield]] match in against [[Western Warriors|Western Australia]], who they beat by 4 wickets on 30 January 1979.
* Whilst Ricky Ponting was in effect the Tasmanian cricket captain from 2001/02 until he announced he was standing down on 21 November 2007, this was primarily a ceremonial appointment in order to have the Australian captain as Tasmanian captain as well. In effect Daniel Marsh, his Vice-Captain, has performed the captaincy duties on most occasions, and was appointed outright following Ponting standing aside.[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/baggygreen/content/story/321400.html]
*[[Daniel Marsh]] captained Tasmania to their first ever [[Pura Cup]] title in 2006/07, when they beat the [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales Blues]] by 421 runs in the final on 23 March 2007.

#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=range/&gt;&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite distant.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve major summits of Canada exceed {{convert|500|km|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic isolation, 31 exceed {{convert|200|km|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, [[List of mountain peaks of Canada#Most isolated major summits|50 exceed {{convert|100|km|2|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}]], and 92 major summits exceed {{convert|50|km|2|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic isolation.

The '''Earth and Mission Science Division''' is a group of European Space Agency ([[ESA]]) mission scientists, research fellows, young graduates, contractors and administrative staff working at the  within the Science, Applications and Climate Department of the Directorate of Earth Observation Programmes. The Division is located at ESA's [[European Space Research and Technology Centre]] in [[Noordwijk]], [[South Holland]], [[The Netherlands]].

== Introduction ==

The Earth and Mission Science Division (MSD) supports the preparation, development and operations of research and operational missions within the Earth Observation Programmes Directorate. The Division is responsible for ensuring the application of scientific and other user community requirements in all phases of the development of Earth Observation missions, from precursor studies through to in-orbit satellite operations, and for ensuring coherence throughout with the objectives expressed in the mission requirements documents, including the management of mission-, instrument-specific, or ad-hoc advisory structures (as required).

In support of the preparation of new mission concepts, or development and operations of each [[ESA]] approved Earth Observation mission, the Division conceives, initiates and conducts supporting scientific studies (in house and external) to ensure that the mission is "fit for purpose". In addition, the Division organises, coordinates and executes Campaigns for the purpose of acquiring airborne, balloon-borne, or in-situ data. Campaigns are specifically designed in support of technology or mission concept development, mission development, data simulation, and instrument calibration or product validation purposes. Campaign data are distributed publicly.

== Mission Science Division Management ==

The Mission Science Division management team are:

* M. Drinkwater (Head of Mission Science Division)
* R. Haagmans (Head of Earth Surfaces and Interior Section)
* M. Davidson (Head of Campaigns Section)
* T. Fehr (Head of Atmospheric Section)


==  Research Missions  ==

The Mission Science Division has prepared and contributed to the approval of eight [[ESA]] Earth Explorers [http://www.esa.int/spaceinvideos/Videos/2013/11/Earth_Explorer_Programme], with two new mission candidates to be selected from proposals resulting from a 2016 call for the ninth Earth Explorer mission, namely:

=== Earth Explorer ''Core'' missions ===
* [[GOCE]] (launched successfully on 17 March 2009; successfully completed its mission on 13 November 2013)[http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/Drinkwater_ISSI_Mar03.pdf].
* [[Aeolus]] (launched successfully on 22 August 2018) [http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/SP-1311_ADM-Aeolus_FINAL_low-res.pdf]
* [[EarthCARE]] [http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/SP_1279_1_EarthCARE.pdf]
* [http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/EarthObservation/SP1324-1_BIOMASSr.pdf Biomass]

A [https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Call_for_new_Earth_Explorer_mission_ideas Call for proposals for Earth Explorer 10 (EE-10) core mission ideas] was released in September 2017 . Three candidate ideas were selected for Phase 0 pre-feasibility study in September 2018:
* [https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Three_Earth_Explorer_ideas_selected STEREOID] (Stereo Thermo-Optically Enhanced Radar for Earth, Ocean, Ice, and land Dynamics)
* [https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Three_Earth_Explorer_ideas_selected Daedalus]
* [https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Three_Earth_Explorer_ideas_selected G-CLASS]

=== Earth Explorer ''Opportunity'' missions ===
* [http://www.esa.int/livingplanet/cryosat CryoSat-2] (launched successfully on 8 April 2010)
* [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity|SMOS]] launched successfully on 2 November 2009)
* [http://www.esa.int/livingplanet/swarm Swarm] (launched successfully on 22 November 2013)
* [[FLEX (satellite)|FLEX]] [http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/New_satellite_to_measure_plant_health -Fluorescence Explorer] (*selected in November 2015)

=== Earth Explorer ''Fast Track'' missions ===
A Call for proposals for new Earth Explorer mission (EE-9) concepts released in November 2015 [http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/ESA_issues_call_for_new_Earth_Explorer_proposals] resulted in no candidate being selected, and a revised Call for proposals was released in December 2016 [https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Reissued_call_for_Earth_Explorer_9_proposals].
Two competing candidates were selected for Phase A/B1 study in November 2017:

* [https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Two_new_Earth_Explorer_concepts_to_understand_our_rapidly_changing_world FORUM] (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring)

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to New Zealand:

'''[[New Zealand]]''' is an [[island country|island nation]] located in the western [[South Pacific Ocean]] comprising two large islands, the [[North Island]] and the [[South Island]], and numerous [[List of islands of New Zealand|smaller islands]], most notably [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]] and the [[Chatham Islands]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=2 July 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nz.html|title=New Zealand|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]]  originally called the North Island '''[[Aotearoa]]''', commonly translated into English as "The Land of the Long White Cloud", which is now used as the [[Maori language]] name for the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McLintock|first1=A. H.|title=Aotearoa|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/aotearoa|encyclopedia=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=16 December 2017|date=24 November 2009|orig-year=originally published in 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand is situated about {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Australia across the [[Tasman Sea]], its closest neighbours to the north being [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]] and [[Tonga]]. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|biodiversity]] of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the [[Southern Alps]], owe much to the [[tectonic uplift]] of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's [[Capital of New Zealand|capital city]] is [[Wellington]], while its most populous city is [[Auckland]].

The population is mostly of [[European New Zealanders|European descent]], with the [[indigenous peoples of Oceania|indigenous]] Māori being the largest minority. [[Asian New Zealanders|Asians]] and non-Māori [[Pacific Islander]]s are also significant minorities, especially in the [[List of cities in New Zealand|cities]]. [[Elizabeth II]], as the [[Queen of New Zealand]], is the [[head of state]] and, in her absence, is represented by a non-partisan [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor-general]]. Political power is held by the [[Democracy|democratically elected]] [[New Zealand Parliament]] under the leadership of the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], who is the [[head of government]]. The [[Realm of New Zealand]] also includes the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]], which are self-governing but in [[Associated state|free association]]; [[Tokelau]]; and the [[Ross Dependency]] (New Zealand's [[Antarctic territorial claims|territorial claim in Antarctica]]).

Panama borders [[Costa Rica]] to the north-west, [[Colombia]] to the south-east, the [[Caribbean Sea]] to the north and the [[North Pacific Ocean]] to the south. It is an international business center and host to important ports, for the volume of traffic, in the Pacific and Caribbean side. Although Panama is the 3rd largest economy in Central America, after [[Guatemala]] and [[Costa Rica]], it has the largest expenditure on resource consumption, making the country the largest consumer in Central America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilri.org/contentman/documentos/Sector%20Cárnico%20CA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OziExplorer''' is [[Raster graphics|raster]] navigation and mapping software for Windows. It is very popular among [[off-road]]
drivers and [[adventure travel]]ers as it allows to use and create custom maps for remote locations that are not fully covered by major map providers like [[Tele Atlas]]. That is why the software is also widely used on [[Post-Soviet states]] territory.

It supports editing, uploading and downloading of waypoints, routes and tracks to most [[Garmin]], [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan]], [[Lowrance]], [[Brunton, Inc.|Brunton]] and MLR GPS devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OziExplorer website |url=http://www.oziexplorer.com/ |accessdate=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OziExplorer provides support for [[Google Maps]], [[Google Earth]], [[TerraServer-USA]], [[OpenStreetMap]] and [[Virtual Earth]] as well as creating your own maps.

==Other versions==
There are two more versions of OziExplorer:
* '''OziExplorer3D''' - [[3D computer graphics|3D]] map viewer

'''Polymictic lakes''' are [[holomictic]] lakes that are too shallow to develop thermal stratification; thus, their waters can mix from top to bottom throughout the ice-free period.  Polymictic lakes can be divided into '''cold polymictic lakes''' (i.e., those that are ice-covered in winter), and '''warm polymictic lakes''' (i.e., polymictic lakes in regions where ice-cover does not develop in winter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1139/f83-207 | last = Lewis | first = William M., Jr. | year = 1983 | title = A revised classification of lakes based on mixing | journal = Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences | volume = 40 | issue = 10 | pages = 1779–1787 | url = http://cires.colorado.edu/limnology/pubs/pdfs/Pub058.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090306140542/http://cires.colorado.edu/limnology/pubs/pdfs/Pub058.pdf | archivedate = 2009-03-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Corrected errors in infobox. The largest province of Iran was incorrectly listed as Sistan and Baluchistan when it is actually Kerman Province. Also the units of the area of largest and smallest provinces in the individual were converting from square miles to square kilometers, resulting in a slightly inaccurate listing of the area of the provinces in square kilometers. I reversed the conversion so it converts from square kilometers to square miles, resulting in an accurate area in both units...</comment>

== Modern history ==
Iran has held its modern territory since the [[Treaty of Paris (1857)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1857. From [[Persian Constitution of 1906|1906]] until 1950, Iran was divided into twelve provinces: [[Ardalan]], [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]], [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Baluchestan]], [[Fars Province|Fars]], [[Gilan]], [[Persian Iraq|Araq-e Ajam]], [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], [[Khuzestan]], [[Kerman]], [[Larestan]], [[Lorestan]], and [[Mazandaran]].&lt;ref name="statoid"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.statoids.com/uir.html| title=Provinces of Iran| first=Statoids website| last=Gwillim Law| accessdate=2006-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Iran was reorganized to form ten numbered provinces with subordinate governorates: Gilan; Mazandaran; East Azerbaijan; West Azerbaijan; Kermanshah; Khuzestan; Fars; Kerman; Khorasan; Isfahan.&lt;ref name="statoid" /&gt;

From 1960 to 1981 the governorates were raised to provincial status one by one. Since then several new provinces have been created, most recently in 2010 when the new [[Alborz Province]] was split from Teheran province, and before that in 2004 when the province of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] was divided into three provinces.&lt;ref name="jazeera"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2B2C2624-ECBE-473A-AF89-A62AF91E7550.htm| title=Iran breaks up largest province| first=Al-Jazeera Satellite Network| last=Online edition| accessdate=2006-04-30| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520194602/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2B2C2624-ECBE-473A-AF89-A62AF91E7550.htm| archivedate=20 May 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Society of Cartographers (SoC)''' is an association of [[cartography|cartographers]] based in the [[United Kingdom]].  The Society was founded in 1964 at the University of Glasgow and was originally named the Society of University Cartographers. In 1989 the Society adopted a new title and constitution opening up membership to anyone who regularly makes maps.

The Society of Cartographers purported aim is to support and encourage all those actively involved in the production of maps – '''whatever the method and format of map production'''. It seeks to do this by providing information and opportunities to contact, meet and exchange views and techniques, they hope to support and encourage those involved in all aspects of mapmaking and maintain a high standard of cartographic illustration and quality, meaningful map production.

The Society's membership is widely drawn from the education sector, statutory institutions, local authorities, public utilities and the commercial and publishing industry. The majority of the membership is UK based, but with a significant world-wide membership.

The SoC is focused on the continual evolution of the mapping industry and how this relates to overlapping disciplines (such as [[GIS]]; [[Graphic Design]], [[Web mapping]]); how maps now manifest themselves in today’s society and what this means to the mapmakers of today.

==Networking==
The Society holds an annual conference the 'Annual Summer School' in August or September.

The Society publishes a newsletter and an annual journal, the Bulletin of the Society of Cartographers

==Legal==
The Society of Cartographers (SoC) is a charity registered in England and Wales (No 326285), operating via a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee (No 05940023)

'''Suhum''' or '''Suḫu''' was an ancient geographic region around the middle course of the [[Euphrates river]], south of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]. Its known history covers the period from the middle Bronze Age (c. 2000-1700/1600&amp;nbsp;BCE) to the Iron Age (c. 1200-700&amp;nbsp;BCE). During the Bronze Age, Suhum was divided into an Upper Suhum, with its capital in [[Anah|Hanat]], and a Lower Suhum with its capital in Jabliji. Several ancient letters place the [[Sutean]] people as having lived in the region of Suhum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heimpel|first1=Wolfgang|title=Letters to the King of Mari: A New Translation, with Historical Introduction, Notes, and Commentary|date=2003|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=9781575060804}} p.26&lt;/ref&gt; In 616&amp;nbsp;BCE, Suhum subordinated themselves to the king of [[Babylon]], [[Nabopolassar]] (ruled 626-605&amp;nbsp;BCE). Three years later, in 613&amp;nbsp;BCE, Suhum rebelled against him, which led Nabopolassar to send an expedition against Suhum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8189">A '''temporary capital''' or a '''provisional capital''' is a city or town chosen by a [[government]] as an interim base of operations due to some difficulty in retaining or establishing control of a different metropolitan area. The most common circumstances leading to this are either a [[civil war]], where control of the capital is contested, or during an invasion, where the designated capital is taken or threatened.

== Historical ==
Examples include:

* During the [[Hungarian War of Independence]] (1848-1849) the government moved from [[Budapest|Pest-Buda]] to [[Debrecen]].&lt;ref name="Papp"&gt;Antal Papp: Magyarország (Hungary), Panoráma, Budapest, 1982, {{ISBN|963 243 241 X}}, p. 860, pp. 463-477&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Colombian Civil War (1860–1862)]], [[Pasto]] was declarated temporary capital by the leaders of the [[Colombian Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;MOSQUERA, Tomás Cipriano de, ''The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the lead-up to and the early weeks of the [[American Civil War]], the provisional government of the [[Confederate States of America]] met in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;before relocating to [[Richmond, Virginia]] after Virginia joined the Confederacy. Likewise, after the fall of Richmond in 1865, the government evacuated to [[Danville, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Hansen (author)|Hansen, Harry]]. ''The Civil War: A History''. [[Signet Classics]], 2002. {{ISBN|0-451-52849-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870-1871), [[France]]'s [[Government of National Defence]] maintained two temporary capitals. President [[Louis-Jules Trochu]] led government ministries in besieged [[Paris]], while Interior Minister [[Léon Gambetta]] evacuated other ministries to [[Bordeaux]].
* During the [[British Raj]] rule of [[India]], some parts of the administration temporarily moved each summer to [[Shimla|Simla]], where the weather is cooler. 
* The [[First Philippine Republic]] government under [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] had four different temporary capitals throughout the [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spanish colonization and subsequent American occupation: [[Malolos]], [[Bacolor, Pampanga|Bacolor]], [[Cabanatuan]], and [[Palanan, Isabela|Palanan]].
* During the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|Serbian Campaign]] in [[World War I]], the government of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] temporarily moved its seat from [[Belgrade]] to [[Niš]] (1914-1915) and [[Corfu]] (1916-1918).
* During World War I, the [[government of Romania]] moved to [[Iaşi]] after the [[Battle of Bucharest|fall of Bucharest to the Central powers]]&lt;ref name=brezianu2007iasi&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrei Brezianu|author2=Vlad Spânu|title=Historical Dictionary of Moldova |year= 2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6446-7 |chapter=Iași |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=iQGyAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Pan-[[Russia|Russian]] "[[White movement|White]]" regime of [[Aleksandr Kolchak|A. Kolchak]] [[Provisional All-Russian Government|in]] [[Omsk]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].
* Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] that ended fighting in World War I, Berlin as the capital was considered too dangerous for the National Assembly to use as a meeting place, because of its street rioting after the 1918 German Revolution. Therefore, the calm and centrally located [[Weimar]] was chosen as the temporary capital (see [[Weimar Republic]]).
* [[Lithuania]] in [[Kaunas]] rather than [[Vilnius]] during the [[interwar period]] when [[Poland]] controlled the latter city (see [[Temporary capital of Lithuania]]).
* During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nationalists initially had a temporary capital at [[Burgos]]; once the Nationalists started to besiege [[Madrid]], the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] maintained temporary capitals first at [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] then at [[Barcelona]] and finally it returned to [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] when [[Barcelona]] fell to the nationalist advance.
* The [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] maintained a temporary capital in [[Chongqing]] when [[Japan]] occupied [[Nanjing]] in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and following the [[Chinese Civil War]] the [[Republic of China]] relocated to [[Taipei]].
* The Parliament of [[Finland]] moved from [[Helsinki]] to [[Kauhajoki]] during the [[Winter War]].
* During [[World War II]] due to evacuation actions following Nazi Germany's [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] the [[Soviet Union]] had different de facto capitals:
** Kuybyshev (now [[Samara, Russia|Samara]]) — planned temporary capital in case of occupation of Moscow and de facto temporary administrative and diplomatic capital
** Sverdlovsk (now [[Yekaterinburg]]) — de facto temporary industrial capital&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Nagorski: The Greatest Battle, 2007, pp. 165-166&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Kazan]] — de facto temporary scientific capital
** [[Tyumen]] — de facto temporary spiritual capital
* During the [[First Indochina War]] (1946–1954) the [[North Vietnam|government]] moved from [[Hanoi]] to [[Việt Bắc]].
* Germany after 1945 considered Berlin to remain the German capital. But due to the onset of the Cold War Berlin itself was divided and 161 kilometers (100 miles) beyond the [[Inner German Border]] within the Soviet-controlled zone that would soon become the [[German Democratic Republic]].  As a result, [[Bonn]] was established as a temporary capital for West Germany until the two Germanies reunited in 1990. The Federal Republic of Germany's government and the bulk of its offices has since moved to Berlin, but a large portion of its offices remain in Bonn. (The German constitution mentions the capital only since 2008.)
* During the [[Korean War]], the [[South Korea]]n government temporarily moved its capital to [[Pusan]] (Busan) before the [[Korean People's Army]] advance which conquered and occupied [[Seoul]]. [[South Korea]] reestablished Seoul as the permanent capital of South Korea after the Korean War Armistice.
* During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], the [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] declared [[Mujibnagar]] as the temporary capital, even though the seat of the governement in exile remained in [[Calcutta]] for most of the war.
* The [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] claimed temporary capitals previously in [[Bir Lehlou]] and currently in [[Tifariti]], in contrast to its de jure capital of [[Laâyoune]].  Its ''de facto'' headquarters is in [[Tindouf Province|Tindouf]], [[Algeria]].
* The [[Transitional Federal Government]] of [[Somalia]] met in various locations within its territory rather than [[Mogadishu]] while the latter was deemed too dangerous to meet in.
* During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) declared its base of operations in [[Benghazi]] to be the temporary capital of the [[Libya]]n Republic, as the NTC had previously declared its capital to be [[Tripoli]], controlled by [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab [[Jamahiriya]].&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff | url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/libya-s-ex-justice-minister-forms-interim-government-in-benghazi-1.345892|title= Libya's Ex-Justice Minister Forms Interim Government in Benghazi&amp;nbsp;– Former Libyan Minister Says Gadhafi 'Alone' Bore Responsibility for Crimes That Occurred, Qurnya Newspaper Reports |date = 26 February 2011|work= [[Haaretz]]|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Topkhana Forest''' ({{lang-az|Topxana meşəsi}}) is a forest&lt;ref&gt;[http://shusha.az/susa-rayonun-%C9%99razisi-v%C9%99-t%C9%99bii-ehtiyatlari Territory, natural resources, historical and cultural landmarks of the Shusha District].&lt;/ref&gt; and a state reserve located near [[Shusha]], [[Azerbaijan]] (''de facto'' [[Republic of Artsakh]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qam.az/az/azerbaycanin-isgal-olunmus-erazilerinde-meselerin-mehv-edilmesi-barede-faktlar-aciqlanib Facts Discovered with Regard to the Destruction of Forests in the Occupied Parts of Azerbaijan]. Karabakh Research Centre. Azeri Community of Nagorno-Karabakh.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gomap.az/Info/Description.aspx?idlo=116&amp;lvo=3&amp;pID=1519946 Topxana Meşəsi Dövlət Qoruğu]&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of its destruction in 1988 caused tensions over the political future of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and encouraged civil and inter-ethnic unrest that would eventually erupt into the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].

==History==
Topkhana is the name of a gently-sloping hillside opposite (and visible from) the town of Shusha, but separated from the town by deep gorge containing the Karkar (also known as the Dashalty) river. Its name derives from it being the location of cannons ("top" in Turkic languages) of [[Mohammad Khan Qajar]] during his siege of Shusha in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Bakour Karapetyan, "The Roots of the Karabagh Problem", page 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The forest was mentioned in [[Anar Rzayev]]'s novel ''The Last Night of the Expiring Year'' first published in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Anar Rzayev. ''Последняя ночь уходящего года''. In: Suleyman Valiyev. Горжусь тобой, мой Азербайджан (anthology of novels by Azerbaijani writers). Azarnashr: Baku, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Yevgeni Kotlyarov, USSR Master of Sports and specialist on athletic tourism, mentioned "forested slopes of the Topkhana plateau in Shusha" in his 1978 publication on mountain tourism in Karabakh.&lt;ref&gt;Yevgeny Kotlyarov. География отдыха и туризма: формирование и развитие территориальных рекреациаонных комплексов. Mysl': Moscow, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book of critical reviews of Soviet literature, published in 1985, writer [[Elchin Afandiyev]], who spent his younger years in Shusha, mentioned "staring into the dark blue depth of the mighty Topkhana forest" as a youth and "dreaming of having [his] first novel published".&lt;ref&gt;Elchin Afandiyev. [http://anl.az/el_ru/alf26/e_pp.pdf Поле притяжения]. Sovetsky Pisatel': Moscow, 1987 (translated edition).&lt;/ref&gt;  In early November 1988, the site was described by [[Galina Starovoitova]] as home to "just one rather spindly tree and some scrubby bushes".&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Rost, ''Armenian Tragedy''. London, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1990. Page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of destruction==
[[file:Kaňon řeky Karkar, Náhorní Karabach.jpg|thumb|Dashalty Gorge]]
In October 1988 [[Abdurrahman Vazirov]], the First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], announced in a speech that a bridge should be constructed across the Hunot Gorge in order to expand the town of Shusha onto the opposite bank and link it to the surrounding countryside. Shusha was predominantly Azeri-populated but the opposite bank was inhabited exclusively by Armenians, who considered this was an attempt to expand Azeri-inhabited territory in Nagorno Karabakh at the expense of its Armenian population. The [[Karabakh Committee]] decided a symbolic Armenian-held structure should be erected on that opposite bank, and on 5 November consulted with the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]], who, in return for an assurance that the upcoming [[Russian Revolution|October Revolution]] parade in [[Yerevan]] would not be disrupted, agreed to send trucks loaded with building materials for the construction. The trucks and materials arrived in Shusha on 7 November. This (in the [[Gregorian calendar]]) was the anniversary of the October 1917 revolution - but Shusha had been placed under curfew and the usual Communist parades and ceremonies had been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Rost, ''Armenian Tragedy''. London, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1990, pages 74-77.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some sources the proposed structure is described as a workshop, in most it is described as a recreational facility for workers at Yerevan's [[Kanaker]] aluminium factory.

On 9 November 1988 construction work began at Topkhana on a vacation resort for workers at Yerevan's Kanaker aluminium factory. Permission for the work had been granted by the civic authorities of nearby [[Askeran (town)|Askeran]], who had designated 15 acres of land for the project. &lt;!-- However, the authorities in [[Baku]] were incensed that they had not been asked to give permission and the Azerbaijani government halted the construction&lt;ref&gt;Mark Malkasian, "Gha-ra-bagh!: The Emergence of the National Democratic Movement in Armenia", p169. Wayne State University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and had the building materials removed from the site. Yuri Rost considered that this demonstration of control from Baku indicated to even the most passive inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh that there would be no political or economic reforms without secession from Azerbaijan. Marc Malkasian describes it as a "major symbolic skirmish". --&gt;

The halting of the construction was accompanied by an "atmosphere of hysteria" erupting in Baku, fed by inaccurate information printed in local Baku newspapers, none of which had actually sent a reporter to Shusha. Nationalists had taken control of the Azerbaijani press, publishing stories that a "sacred grove" had been destroyed by Armenians who were going to build an aluminium plant. The aim was to stir up popular pro-Azerbaijani and anti-Armenian sentiments. An editorial in Bakinskiy Rabochiy (Baku Worker) called the construction a "branch of the Kanakerskiy Aluminum Plant", the location the "Topkhan Natural History Museum of living nature", and asserted that for Azerbaijanis, Topkhana was "the final drop that made the cup of patience overflow".&lt;ref&gt;[[Joint Publications Research Service|JPRS]] Report: "Soviet Union Political Affairs", 13 February 1989, page 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart J. Kaufman, "Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War". p67.&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan radio claimed that Topkhane was a "historical natural monument" and the site of an Azerbaijani fortress. &lt;!-- In the words of Malkasian, "a rather nondescript hill became a sacred forest in Baku media" as a "product of Transcaucasia's overheated political atmosphere". --&gt; The result was an organized Azerbaijani popular movement emerging for the first time in the growing Nagorno-Karabagh crisis&lt;ref&gt;Stuart J. Kaufman, "Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War", p66.&lt;/ref&gt; and, starting on November 17, large-scale demonstrations began in Baku's [[Azadliq Square, Baku|Lenin Square]] to protest against the supposed destruction at Topkhana. The 17 November event is now commemorated as a national holiday in Azerbaijan, known as "National Revival Day".&lt;ref&gt;1992 Azerbaijani law defining official holidays: AZƏRBAYCAN RESPUBLİKASININ QANUNU. 1992-ci il, 27 oktyabr {{cite web |url=http://e-qanun.az/print.php?internal=view&amp;target=1&amp;docid=7874&amp;doctype=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129154037/http://e-qanun.az/print.php?internal=view&amp;target=1&amp;docid=7874&amp;doctype=0 |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- As the Baku demonstrations continued, they became increasingly Islamic and increasingly anti-Armenian, with chants of "death to the Armenians"&lt;ref&gt;Mark Malkasian, "Gha-ra-bagh!: The Emergence of the National Democratic Movement in Armenia", p170. Wayne State University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and demands that those convicted of the murder of Armenians during the [[Sumgait pogrom]] be released. The demonstrations also developed into an anti-central government, anti-Soviet protest. On November 23 a curfew was imposed in Baku: as Soviet troops tried unsuccessfully to disperse the crowds, attacks on Armenians and their homes became more numerous. Civil unrest also spread to other towns in Azerbaijan with Armenian minorities, [[Kirovabad pogrom|particularly in Kirovabad]].. --&gt;

Azerbaijani sources still maintain that the Baku reports of November 1988 about Topkhana are true, describing the alleged forest as "a true miracle of nature", claiming "here lived plants, bears, wolves, wild boars, foxes, hares, deer, quail, pigeons, a variety of other animals and birds. Along the forest stretched sub-alpine and alpine meadows, deep gorges and springs dazzled the imagination. It is estimated that more than 2,000 oak trees and other rare species of trees have been felled at Topkhana and transported to Armenia. Its rich flora and fauna continue to be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.azertag.az/ru/node/1085#.VE5HI_msVr8&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Walls of Tallinn''' are the medieval defensive walls constructed around the city of [[Tallinn]] in [[Estonia]].

==History==
The first wall around Tallinn was ordered to be constructed by [[Margaret Sambiria]] in 1265 and for that reason, it was known as the Margaret Wall. This wall was less than {{convert|5|m|ft|}} tall and about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|}} thick at its base.&lt;ref&gt; [[Andriy Ksenofontov]], [http://www.epl.ee/?artikkel = Wall Street ...] Estonian Times, 15 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time it has been enlarged and strengthened. The walls and the many gates are still largely  extant today. This is one of the reasons that Tallinn's old town became a [[World Heritage Site]]. The walls were enlarged in the fourteenth century, and citizens of Tallinn were required to turn out for guard duty, which meant to wear their armour and demonstrate their readiness to face off invaders.&lt;ref name=bousfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Bousfield|first=Jonathon|title=The Rough Guide to Estonia, Latvia &amp; Lithuania p.71|year=2011|pages=392|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kGTCuUxrdKoC&amp;dq=Tallinn+city+wall|isbn=9781848368880}}&lt;/ref&gt;
