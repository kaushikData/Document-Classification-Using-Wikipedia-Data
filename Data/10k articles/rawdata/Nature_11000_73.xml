'''{{mp|(177049) 2003 EE|16}}''', [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisionally known]] as '''2003 EE16''', is an [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo]] [[near-Earth asteroid]] and [[potentially hazardous object]].&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; It was discovered on 8 March 2003 by [[Spacewatch|LPL/Spacewatch II]] at an [[apparent magnitude]] of 20 using a {{convert|1.8|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[reflecting telescope]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2003-E34"/&gt; It has an estimated diameter of {{convert|320|m|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Wayback2003-04"/&gt; The asteroid was listed on [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] with a [[Torino Scale]] rating of 1 on 2 April 2003.&lt;ref name="Wayback2003-04"/&gt;

== Description ==

Many of the virtual impactors were located near the [[Curve fitting|nominal]] orbital solution and the asteroid has a low inclination relative to Earth's orbit.&lt;ref name="spaceguard"/&gt; Observation by the [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT) 8 meter facilities on 22 May and 19 June 2003 when {{mp|2003 EE|16}} was very dim with an apparent magnitude between 24–25&lt;ref group="note"&gt;At an [[apparent magnitude]] of 24, the asteroid was roughly 10 million times fainter than can be seen with the [[naked eye]].&lt;br&gt;Math: &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt[5]{100})^{24-6.5}= 10000000&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; refined the orbit.&lt;ref name="spaceguard"/&gt; It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 28 May 2003.&lt;ref name="removed"/&gt;

{{mp|2003 EE|16}} has the smallest Earth [[Minimum orbit intersection distance]] (MOID) of any known [[potentially hazardous asteroid]].&lt;ref name="jpl-search"/&gt; The Earth MOID is {{convert|0.0000475|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="jpl-search"/&gt; Asteroids with a smaller Earth MOID are less than ~100 meters in diameter such as {{mpl|2013 XY|8}} and {{mpl|2010 TD|54}}. Earth impactors {{mpl|2008 TC|3}} and [[2014 AA]] had small Earth MOID values as they were on their impact approach when discovered.

'''{{mp|2007 VE|191}}''' is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]] that was listed on the [[Sentry Risk Table]].&lt;ref name=summary /&gt;

== Description ==

It is estimated to be roughly 63 meters in diameter. In 2015 it was known to have a 1 in 63,000 chance of [[Impact event|impacting]] Earth on 27 November 2015.&lt;ref name=summary /&gt; However, the [[Curve fitting|nominal]] best-fit orbit showed that {{mp|2007 VE|191}} would be roughly {{convert|0.5|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth on 27 November 2015 with an [[apparent magnitude]] of roughly +25 in the [[constellation]] of [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] about 50 degrees from the Sun,&lt;ref name="NEODyS2015" /&gt; and the same nominal orbit gave a distance of closest approach to Earth of a little under 0.4 AU a few weeks earlier. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 17 September 2015,&lt;ref name="removed" /&gt; but was still listed at [[NEODyS]] with odds of 1 in 3 million for 27 November 2015 during the approach window.&lt;ref name="Impactor" /&gt;

{{mp|2007 VE|191}} was discovered on 15 November 2007 by the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] at an apparent magnitude of 20 using a {{convert|1.5|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[reflecting telescope]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2007-W05"/&gt; On 28 November 2007, it passed {{convert|0.0128|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; {{mp|2007 VE|191}} has an [[observation arc]] of 13 days with an [[Uncertainty Parameter U|uncertainty parameter]] of 7, which means its orbit is poorly constrained.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; {{mp|2007 VE|191}} was last observed on 28 November 2007.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; By 1 December 2007, the asteroid had faded to below magnitude 25.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2007"/&gt;

With an [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] of 23.6,&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; {{mp|2007 VE|191}} is about 50–110&amp;nbsp;meters in diameter.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

'''3200 Phaethon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|eɪ|.|ə|θ|ɒ|n}} {{Respell|FAY|ə-thon}}, sometimes incorrectly spelled '''Phaeton'''), [[provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] {{nowrap|'''1983 TB'''}}, is an [[Apollo asteroid]] with an orbit that brings it closer to the [[Sun]] than any other [[Minor planet#Naming|named asteroid]] (though there are numerous unnamed asteroids with smaller perihelia, such as {{mpl|(137924) 2000 BD|19}}).&lt;ref name="JPL-q141"/&gt; For this reason, it was named after the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of [[Phaethon|Phaëthon]], son of the sun god [[Helios]]. It is {{convert|3.6|mi|km|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} in [[diameter]]&lt;ref name="JPL20171222" /&gt; and is the parent body of the [[Geminids]] [[meteor shower]] of mid-December. With an [[observation arc]] of 30+ years, it has a very well [[Orbit determination|determined orbit]].&lt;ref name=jpldata /&gt; The 2017 Earth approach distance of about 10 million km was known with an accuracy of ±40 km.&lt;ref name=jpldata /&gt;

== Discovery ==
Phaethon was the first asteroid to be discovered using images from a spacecraft. [[Simon F. Green]] and [[John K. Davies]] discovered it in images from October 11, 1983, while searching [[Infrared Astronomical Satellite]] (IRAS) data for moving objects. It was formally announced on October 14 in IAUC 3878 along with optical confirmation by [[Charles T. Kowal]], who reported it to be asteroidal in appearance. Its provisional designation was {{nowrap|1983 TB}}, and it later received the numerical designation and name {{nowrap|3200 Phaethon}} in 1985.

== Orbital characteristics ==
[[File:3200 Phaethon orbit dec 2017.png|thumb|left|The elliptical orbit of 3200 Phaethon crosses the orbits of Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury]]

Phaethon is categorized as an [[Apollo asteroid]], as its orbital [[semi-major axis]] is greater than that of the [[Earth]]'s at {{convert|1.27|AU|e6km+e6mi|sigfig=3|abbr=unit|lk=in}}. It is also suspected to be a member of the [[Pallas family]] of asteroids.&lt;ref name="natgeo20101012" /&gt;

Its most remarkable distinction is that it approaches the Sun closer than any other named asteroid: its [[perihelion]] is only {{convert|0.14|AU|e6km+e6mi|sigfig=3|abbr=unit}} &amp;mdash; less than half of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s perihelial distance. It is a [[List of Mercury-crossing minor planets|Mercury-]], [[List of Venus-crossing minor planets|Venus-]], [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-]], and [[List of Mars-crossing minor planets|Mars-crosser]] as a result of its high orbital eccentricity. The surface temperature at perihelion could reach around {{convert|1025|K|C F|-1}}.

Phaethon is a possible candidate for detecting [[General relativity|general relativistic]] and/or solar [[oblateness]] effects in its orbital motion due to the frequent close approaches to the Sun.&lt;ref name="Goldstone"/&gt;

=== Potentially hazardous asteroid ===

Phaethon is categorized as a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] (PHA),&lt;ref name=jpldata /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa20071203"/&gt; but that does not mean there is a near-term threat of an impact. It is a potentially hazardous asteroid merely as a result of its size ([[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] {{nowrap|''H'' ≤ 22}}) and Earth [[minimum orbit intersection distance]] {{nowrap|(''Earth MOID'' ≤ 0.05 AU}}).&lt;ref name="NEOP"/&gt; The Earth minimum orbit intersection distance (E-MOID) is {{cvt|0.01945|AU|abbr=on}}, which is defined by the shortest distance between the orbit of Phaethon and the orbit of Earth.&lt;ref name=jpldata /&gt; With a 30+ year observation arc, the orbit of Phaethon is very well understood with very small uncertainties.&lt;ref name=jpldata /&gt; Close approaches of Phaethon are well constrained for the next 400 years.&lt;ref name="Goldstone"/&gt;

{{Large near earth asteroid flybys 10LD}}

== Physical characteristics ==

Phaethon is an asteroid with fairly unusual characteristics in that its orbit more closely resembles that of a [[comet]] than an asteroid; it has been referred to as a "[[rock comet]]".&lt;ref name=Jewitt2010 /&gt; In recent studies performed by [[NASA]]'s [[STEREO]] spacecraft, dust tails have been observed,&lt;ref name="Jewitt2013" /&gt; and in 2010, Phaethon was detected ejecting dust.&lt;ref name="skymania2013" /&gt; It is possible that the Sun's heat is causing fractures similar to [[mudcrack]]s in a [[dry lake]] bed.&lt;ref name="skymania2013" /&gt;

Phaethon's composition fits the notion of its cometary origin; it is classified as a [[B-type asteroid]] because it is composed of dark material. Since its discovery, several other objects were found exhibiting mixed cometary and asteroidal features, such as [[7968 Elst–Pizarro|133P/Elst–Pizarro]].

== Meteor shower ==

Shortly after its discovery, [[Fred Whipple]] observed that the "orbital elements of 1983 TB shown on IAUC 3879 are virtually coincident with the mean orbital elements of 19 Geminid meteors photographed with the super-Schmidt meteor cameras".&lt;ref name=IAUC3881 /&gt; In other words, Phaethon is the long-sought parent body of the [[Geminids]] [[meteor shower]] of mid-December.

== Close approaches ==

Phaethon approached to {{convert|0.120895|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=in}} of Earth on December 10, 2007,&lt;ref name=jpldata /&gt; and was detected by [[radar astronomy|radar]] at [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]].&lt;ref name="Goldstone"/&gt; When Phaethon came to perihelion in July 2009, it was found to be brighter than expected.&lt;ref name="BAA2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=IAUC9054 /&gt; During its approach, the [[STEREO]]-A spacecraft detected an unexpected brightening, roughly by a factor of two.&lt;ref name=Jewitt2010 /&gt;

=== 2010 approach ===
[[File:Asteroid Phaethon 25dec2010 stack.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Phaethon imaged on December 25, 2010, with the {{nowrap|37-cm}} {{f/|14}} Rigel telescope at [[Winer Observatory]] by Marco Langbroek]]
{{-}}
=== 2017 approach ===

On December 16, 2017, at 23:00&amp;nbsp;[[Universal Time|UT]], Phaethon passed {{convert|0.06893173|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} from Earth (27 [[lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]]s).&lt;ref name=jpldata /&gt; The Earth approach distance was known with a [[3-sigma]] accuracy of ±40 km.&lt;ref name=jpldata /&gt;{{efn|name=JPL2014}} This was the best opportunity to date for radar observations by [[Goldstone Solar System Radar|Goldstone]] and [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]], with a resolution of {{convert|75|m||abbr=off|sp=us|disp=x|/pixel (|/pixel)}}.&lt;ref name="Goldstone"/&gt;

The asteroid was bright enough to see in small telescopes, peaking at magnitude 10.8 between December 13–15 while dimming slightly to magnitude 11 on December 16 at closest approach.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2017"/&gt; Arecibo made observations of Phaethon from December 15-19.&lt;ref name="JPL20171222"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7030 |title=Arecibo Radar Returns with Asteroid Phaethon Images |publisher=NASA |first1=D.

==Description==
The center has a number of educational exhibits, a wide variety of more than 70 snake species, reptiles are also on display, as are more than 30 species of frogs, and a display of spiders and insects. The zoo also organizes naturalist trips and tours to view of over 40 species of butterfly into the surrounding jungle to emulate that of the natural habitats of the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The center also has many arachnid and insect species including [[tarantula]]s, [[rhinoceros beetle]]s and giant 5&amp;nbsp;inch [[caterpillar]]s. 

The zoo was founded by Victor Hugo Quesada and his wife Ofelia in 2000. Its original name was El Serpentario Zoologico del Castillo. Today it is known as the Arenal Eco Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.costarica.com/attractions/arenal-ecozoo|title=Arenal EcoZoo|website=Costa Rica|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''asthenosphere''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀσθενής ''asthenḗs'' 'weak' + "sphere") is the highly viscous, mechanically weak&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrel | first1 = J. | year = 1914 | title = The strength of the crust, Part VI.

It lies below the [[lithosphere]], at depths between approximately {{convert|80|and|200|km|sigfig=2|abbr=in}} below the surface. The [[Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary]] is usually referred to as LAB.&lt;ref&gt;Harsh Gupta (29 June 2011). Encyclopedia of Solid Earth Geophysics.

The lower boundary of the asthenosphere is not well defined. The thickness of the asthenosphere depends mainly on the temperature. However, the [[rheology]] of the asthenosphere also depends on the rate of deformation,&lt;ref&gt;http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2014/EGU2014-10790.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that the asthenosphere could be also formed as a result of a high rate of deformation. In some regions the asthenosphere could extend as deep as {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}}. It is considered the source region of mid-ocean ridge [[basalt]] (MORB).&lt;ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
The asthenosphere is a part of the upper mantle just below the [[lithosphere]] that is involved in [[Plate tectonics|plate tectonic movement]] and [[Isostasy|isostatic]] adjustments. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is conventionally taken at the 1300&amp;nbsp;°C [[Isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]], above which the mantle behaves in a rigid fashion and below which it behaves in a [[Ductility (Earth science)|ductile]] fashion.&lt;ref name="GeolSoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Education-and-Careers/Resources/Papers-and-Reports/Flood-basalts-mantle-plumes-and-mass-extinctions/The-Crust-and-Lithosphere |title=The Crust and Lithosphere |last1=Self |first1=Steve |last2=Rampino |first2=Mike |publisher=[[Geological Society of London]] |year=2012 |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seismic wave]]s pass relatively slowly through the asthenosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forsyth |first=Donald W. |title=The early structural evolution and anisotropy of the oceanic upper mantle |url=http://gji.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/1/103 |accessdate=January 24, 2016 |journal=Geophysical Journal International |year=1975 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=103–162 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.1975.tb00630.x|bibcode=1975GeoJ...43..103F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  compared to the overlying lithospheric mantle, thus it has been called the ''[[low-velocity zone]]'' (LVZ), although the two are not exactly the same.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kearey (17 July 2009).

Springer Science &amp; Business. pp. 318–. {{ISBN|978-3-642-34023-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This decreasing in seismic waves velocity from lithosphere to asthenosphere could be caused by the presence of a very small percentage of melt in the asthenosphere. The lower boundary of the LVZ lies at a depth of 180–220&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref name="Condie"&gt;{{cite book |last=Condie |first=Kent C. |title=Plate tectonics and crustal evolution |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |year=1997 |page=123 |isbn=978-0-7506-3386-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZrA6OQzsvgC&amp;pg=PA123 |accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the base of the asthenosphere lies at a depth of about 700&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Kearey"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kearey |first1=Philip |last2=Vine |first2=Frederick J. |title=Global Tectonics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usiqam9p7GAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA41 |accessdate=21 May 2010 |edition=2 |year=1996 |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |isbn=978-0-86542-924-6 |pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the observation that originally alerted [[seismology|seismologists]] to its presence and gave some information about its physical properties, as the speed of seismic waves decreases with decreasing [[Stiffness|rigidity]].

In the old [[ocean]]ic [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] the transition from the lithosphere to the asthenosphere, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) is shallow (about 60&amp;nbsp;km in some regions) with a sharp and large velocity drop (5–10%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rychert |first1=Catherine A. |last2=Shearer |first2=Peter M. |year=2011 |title=Imaging the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary beneath the Pacific using SS waveform modeling |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth |volume=116 |issue=B7 |pages= |doi=10.1029/2010JB008070 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010JB008070/full |accessdate=January 24, 2016 |bibcode=2011JGRB..116.7307R}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[mid-ocean ridge]]s the LAB rises to within a few kilometers of the ocean floor.

The upper part of the asthenosphere is believed to be the zone upon which the great rigid and brittle lithospheric [[tectonic plate|plates of the Earth's crust]] move about. Due to the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] conditions in the asthenosphere, [[Rock (geology)|rock]] becomes [[ductile]], moving at rates of deformation measured in cm/yr over lineal distances eventually measuring thousands of kilometers. In this way, it flows like a [[convection]] current, radiating heat outward from the Earth's interior.  Above the asthenosphere, at the same rate of deformation, rock behaves elastically and, being brittle, can break, causing [[Fault (geology)|faults]]. The rigid lithosphere is thought to "float" or move about on the slowly flowing asthenosphere, creating the movement of [[tectonic plates]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Hendrix; Graham R. Thompson (24 January 2014). EARTH2. Cengage Learning. pp. 493–. {{ISBN|978-1-305-43687-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom S. Garrison; Robert Ellis (5 December 2016). Essentials of Oceanography.

== Historical ==
Although its presence was suspected as early as 1926, the worldwide occurrence of the asthenosphere was confirmed by analyses of seismic waves from the 9.5 [[Moment magnitude scale|M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Great Chilean earthquake]] of May 22, 1960.

'''BETTERY Inc.''' was a privately held company based in Portland, Oregon. It provided a retail store-based reusable battery exchange service to consumers. BETTERY kiosks or "Swap Stations" allow consumers to buy ready to use reusable AA or AAA batteries that can be used just like any other single use battery. Once drained, the batteries can be swapped for a fully tested and charged replacement. The company previously had placed five kiosks at [[Whole Foods Market]] locations in the Pacific Northwest and placed five additional kiosks at Whole Foods and Safeway stores in Seattle and Portland. The BETTERY brand was sold in 2014 to Green Box Batteries, LLC, a Tacoma, WA privately held company. Green Box Batteries, LLC has re-launched the BETTERY brand with a focus on bringing batteries to the world of subscription services much like Netflix did for DVD rentals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablebusinessoregon.com/articles/2013/04/bettery-goes-for-the-whole-shebang.html | title=BETTERY goes for the Whole shebang | publisher=Portland Business Journal | date= 2013-04-03|accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental Impact ==
Batteries account for &gt;1% of waste poundage, but 88% of mercury, 52% of cadmium, and in total they account for 50-70% of all heavy metal contaminants in landfills including Zinc, Manganese, Lead, Nickel, Cobalt, Cadmium, Arsenic, and Mercury depending on the battery chemistry mix in a given landfill location. By using a reusable battery swap service, battery use has up to 30 times less impact on air pollutants (such as Carbon, Nitrogen, and Methane gases) than disposable batteries. That is equivalent to driving a car 1,243 miles less each year per consumer.

By making it easier for consumers to use reusable battery technology, The BETTERY brand reduces the volume of batteries that are thrown away in the U.S. every year. Approximately 90 percent of portable batteries manufactured in the US are alkaline dry cells with a global annual production exceeding 10 billion units. Today, the majority of these batteries end up in landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/1896863/738588603/name/MIT%20Battery%20LCA%20by%20NEMA%20Final.pdf | title=Life Cycle Impacts of Alkaline Batteries with a Focus on End-of-Life | publisher=National Electrical Manufacturers Association | date= 2011-02-01|accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each BETTERY reusable battery can be swapped and reused up to a thousand times before it is recycled back into the manufacturing stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recyclinginternational.com/recycling-news/7006/e-waste-and-batteries/united-states/better-battery-recycling-bettery | title=Better battery recycling with BETTERY? | publisher=Recycling International | date=2013-04-12|accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers can use the BETTERY kiosk to drop off traditional single-use batteries, where they will be recycled. The contents of recycled batteries can be salvaged to make metal and other raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opb.org/news/blog/ecotrope/what-happens-to-recycled-batteries/ | title=What Happens to Recycled Batteries? | publisher=OPB News | date=2013-04-04|accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 2011 with the mission to reduce waste by utilizing the latest advancements in reusable battery technology, BETTERY belongs to the movement of companies with sustainability at its core. With a veteran team of executives and advisers from major battery, kiosk and high tech companies, BETTERY is poised to reinvent the portable power industry.

[[File:Mount Mazama eruption timeline.PNG|thumb|right|[[Mount Mazama]]'s eruption timeline, an example of caldera formation]]

A '''caldera''' is a large [[cauldron]]-like hollow that forms following the evacuation of a [[magma chamber]]/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a [[Volcanic crater|crater]], the feature is actually a type of [[sinkhole]], as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at [[Bárðarbunga]] volcano in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Gudmundsson, M.T. et al. (2014) Graduale caldera collapse at Bárðarbunga volcano Iceland, regulated by lateral magma outflow, Science, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word comes from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''{{wiktes|caldera}}'', and [[Latin]] ''{{wiktla|caldaria}}'', meaning "cooking pot".  In some texts the English term ''cauldron'' is also used. The term ''caldera'' was introduced into the geological vocabulary by the German geologist [[Leopold von Buch]] when he published his memoirs of his 1815 visit to the [[Canary Islands]],{{refn|group=note|name=note 1|Leopold von Buch's book ''Physical Description of the Canary Isles'' was published in 1825}} where he first saw the Las Cañadas caldera on [[Tenerife]], with Montaña [[Teide]] dominating the landscape, and then the [[Caldera de Taburiente]] on [[La Palma]].

==Caldera formation==
[[File:Origin of volcanic caldera via analogue model.gif|thumb|left|Animation of analogue experiment showing origin of volcanic caldera in box filled with flour.]]
[[File:Toba zoom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Landsat]] image of [[Lake Toba]], on the island of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] (100 km/62 mi long and 30 km/19 mi wide, one of the world's largest calderas). A [[resurgent dome]] formed the island of [[Samosir]].]]

A collapse is triggered by the emptying of the [[magma chamber]] beneath the volcano, sometimes as the result of a large explosive [[volcano|volcanic eruption]]  (see [[1815 eruption of Mount Tambora|Tambora]]  in 1815), but also during effusive eruptions on the flanks of a volcano (see [[Piton de la Fournaise]] in 2007) or in a connected fissure system (see [[Bárðarbunga]] in 2014–2015). If enough [[magma]] is ejected, the emptied chamber is unable to support the weight of the volcanic edifice above it. A roughly circular [[Fracture (geology)|fracture]], the "ring fault", develops around the edge of the chamber. Ring fractures serve as feeders for fault [[intrusion]]s which are also known as [[Ring dike|ring dykes]]. Secondary volcanic vents may form above the ring fracture. As the magma chamber empties, the center of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse. The collapse may occur as the result of a single cataclysmic eruption, or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions. The total area that collapses may be hundreds or thousands of square kilometers.

===Mineralization===
Some calderas are known to host rich [[ore deposit]]s. One of the world's best-preserved [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralized]] calderas is the [[Sturgeon Lake Caldera]] in [[northwestern Ontario]], Canada, which formed during the [[Neoarchean]] [[Era (geology)|era]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/prc/workshops/S08workshop.html |title=UMD: Precambrian Research Center |publisher=University of Minnesota, Duluth |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 2,700 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rmorton/ronshome/Volcanoes/calderas.html |title=Caldera Volcanoes |author= Ron Morton |publisher=University of Minnesota, Duluth |date=|accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explosive caldera eruptions===
{{Details|Explosive eruption}}
If the [[magma]] is rich in [[silica]], the caldera is often filled in with [[ignimbrite]], [[tuff]], [[rhyolite]], and other [[igneous rock]]s. Silica-rich magma has a high [[viscosity]], and therefore does not flow easily like [[basalt]]. As a result, gases tend to become trapped at high pressure within the magma. When the magma approaches the surface of the Earth, the rapid off-loading of overlying material causes the trapped gases to decompress rapidly, thus triggering explosive destruction of the magma and spreading [[volcanic ash]] over wide areas. Further [[lava]] flows may be erupted.

If volcanic activity continues, the center of the caldera may be uplifted in the form of a ''[[resurgent dome]]'' such as is seen at [[Galán|Cerro Galán]], [[Lake Toba]], [[Yellowstone Caldera|Yellowstone]], etc., by subsequent intrusion of magma. A ''silicic'' or ''[[Rhyolite|rhyolitic]] caldera'' may erupt hundreds or even thousands of cubic kilometers of material in a single event. Even small caldera-forming eruptions, such as [[Krakatoa]] in 1883 or [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991, may result in significant local destruction and a noticeable drop in temperature around the world. Large calderas may have even greater effects.

When Yellowstone Caldera last erupted some 650,000 years ago, it released about 1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of material (as measured in dense rock equivalent (DRE)), covering a substantial part of [[North America]] in up to two metres of debris. By comparison, when [[Mount St. Helens]] erupted in 1980, it released ~1.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (DRE) of ejecta. The ecological effects of the eruption of a large caldera can be seen in the record of the [[Lake Toba]] eruption in [[Indonesia]].

====Toba====
{{Main|Lake Toba|Toba catastrophe theory}}

About 74,000 years ago, this Indonesian volcano released about {{convert|2800|km3}} [[dense-rock equivalent]] of ejecta. This was the largest known eruption during the ongoing [[Quaternary]] period (the last 2.6&amp;nbsp;million years) and the largest known explosive eruption during the last 25&amp;nbsp;million years. In the late 1990s, [[anthropologist]] Stanley Ambrose&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anthro.illinois.edu/people/ambrose | title=Stanley Ambrose page | publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign | accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that a [[volcanic winter]] induced by this eruption reduced the human population to about 2,000–20,000 individuals, resulting in a [[population bottleneck]]. More recently, [[Lynn Jorde]] and [[Henry Harpending]] proposed that the human species was reduced to approximately 5,000-10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/supervolcanoes_script.shtml Supervolcanoes], [[BBC2]], 3 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; There is no direct evidence, however, that either theory is correct, and there is no evidence for any other animal decline or extinction, even in environmentally sensitive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gathorne-Hardy | first1=F.

Eruptions forming even larger calderas are known, especially [[La Garita Caldera]] in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], where the {{convert|5000|km3}} [[Fish Canyon Tuff]] was blasted out in eruptions about 27.8 million years ago.&lt;ref name=livescience&gt;

At some points in [[geological time]], rhyolitic calderas have appeared in distinct clusters. The remnants of such clusters may be found in places such as the San Juan Mountains of Colorado (formed during the [[Oligocene]], [[Miocene]], and [[Pliocene]] epochs) or the [[Saint Francois Mountain Range]] of [[Missouri]] (erupted during the [[Proterozoic]] eon).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kisvarsanyi|first=Eva|year=1981|title=Geology of the Precambrian St. Francois terrane, southeastern Missouri|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/1246541|journal=Report of investigations (Missouri Geological Survey) no. 64|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-explosive calderas===
[[File:Iss038e012569, Caldera Sollipulli.jpg|thumb|Sollipulli Caldera, located in central Chile near the border with Argentina, filled with ice. The volcano is in the southern Andes Mountains within Chile's Parque Nacional Villarica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=82676 | title=EO | website=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov | accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Some volcanoes, such as the large [[shield volcano]]es [[Kīlauea]] and [[Mauna Loa]] on the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]], form calderas in a different fashion. The magma feeding these volcanoes is [[basalt]], which is silica poor. As a result, the magma is much less [[Viscosity|viscous]] than the magma of a rhyolitic volcano, and the magma chamber is drained by large lava flows rather than by explosive events. The resulting calderas are also known as subsidence calderas and can form more gradually than explosive calderas. For instance, the caldera atop [[Fernandina Island]] collapsed in 1968 when parts of the caldera floor dropped {{convert|350|m}}.&lt;ref name=gvp&gt;{{cite gvp | vn=353010&amp;vtab=Photos | title=Fernandina: Photo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial calderas==
Since the early 1960s, it has been known that volcanism has occurred on other planets and moons in the [[Solar System]]. Through the use of manned and unmanned spacecraft, volcanism has been discovered on [[Venus]], [[Mars]], the [[Moon]], and [[Io (moon)|Io]], a satellite of [[Jupiter]]. None of these worlds have [[plate tectonics]], which contributes approximately 60% of the Earth's volcanic activity (the other 40% is attributed to [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] volcanism).&lt;ref name = "Wilson"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Parfitt | first = L. | author-link =  | last2 = Wilson | first2 = L.  | author2-link = | title = Fundamentals of Physical Volcanology | place = Malden, MA | publisher = [[Blackwell Publishing]]| date= Feb 19, 2008| edition = | chapter = Volcanism on Other Planets| chapterurl = | pages = 190–212| language =  | url = http://google.com/books?id=ptpCiNkwLj8C&amp;printsec=frontcover| doi =  | id =  | isbn = 978-0-632-05443-5 | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm = | oclc = 173243845| postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caldera structure is similar on all of these planetary bodies, though the size varies considerably. The average caldera diameter on Venus is 68&amp;nbsp;km. The average caldera diameter on Io is close to 40&amp;nbsp;km, and the mode is 6&amp;nbsp;km; [[Tvashtar Paterae]] is likely the largest caldera with a diameter of 290&amp;nbsp;km. The average caldera diameter on Mars is 48&amp;nbsp;km, smaller than Venus. Calderas on Earth are the smallest of all planetary bodies and vary from 1.6 to 80&amp;nbsp;km as a maximum.&lt;ref&gt;Gudmundsson, A. (2008) ''Magma chamber geometry, fluid transport, local stresses and rock behaviour during collapse caldera formation'' in Gottsmann, J. and Marti, J. (editors) (2008) ''Caldera Volcanism: Analysis, Modelling and Response'', Amsterdam, Elsevier. p. 319, citing Lipman, P. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Moon===
The [[Moon]] has an outer shell of low-density crystalline rock that is a few hundred kilometers thick, which formed due to a rapid creation. The craters of the moon have been well preserved through time and were once thought to have been the result of extreme volcanic activity, but actually were formed by meteorites, nearly all of which took place in the first few hundred million years after the Moon formed. Around 500&amp;nbsp;million years afterward, the Moon's mantle was able to be extensively melted due to the decay of radioactive elements. Massive basaltic eruptions took place generally at the base of large impact craters. Also, eruptions may have taken place due to a magma reservoir at the base of the crust. This forms a dome, possibly the same morphology of a shield volcano where calderas universally are known to form.&lt;ref name = "Wilson"/&gt; Although caldera-like structures are rare on the Moon, they are not completely absent. The [[Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly|Compton-Belkovich Volcanic Complex]] on the [[far side of the Moon]] is thought to be a caldera, possibly an [[Pyroclastic flow|ash-flow]] caldera.&lt;ref name="Compton-Belkovich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chauhan|first1=M.|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=S.|last3=Saran|first3=S.|last4=Chauhan|first4=P.|last5=Dagar|first5=A.|title=Compton–Belkovich Volcanic Complex (CBVC): An ash flow caldera on the Moon|journal=Icarus|date=2015|volume=253|pages=115–29|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2015.02.024|bibcode=2015Icar..253..115C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mars===
{{Further|Volcanology of Mars}}
The volcanic activity of [[Mars]] is concentrated in two major provinces: [[Tharsis]] and [[Elysium (volcanic province)|Elysium]]. Each province contains a series of giant shield volcanoes that are similar to what we see on Earth and likely are the result of mantle [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spots]]. The surfaces are dominated by lava flows, and all have one or more collapse calderas.&lt;ref name = "Wilson"/&gt; Mars has the largest volcano in the Solar System, [[Olympus Mons]], which is more than three times the height of Mount Everest, with a diameter of 520&amp;nbsp;km (323 miles). The summit of the mountain has six nested calderas.&lt;ref&gt;Philip's World Reference Atlas including Stars and Planets {{ISBN|0-7537-0310-6}} Publishing House Octopus publishing Group Ltd p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venus===
{{Further|Volcanology of Venus}}
Because there is no [[plate tectonics]] on [[Venus]], heat is mainly lost by conduction through the [[lithosphere]]. This causes enormous lava flows, accounting for 80% of Venus' surface area. Many of the mountains are large [[shield volcano]]es that range in size from 150–400&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and 2–4&amp;nbsp;km high. More than 80 of these large shield volcanoes have summit calderas averaging 60&amp;nbsp;km across.&lt;ref name = "Wilson"/&gt;

===Io===
{{Further|Volcanology of Io}}
Io, unusually, is heated by solid flexing due to the [[Tidal force|tidal]] influence of [[Jupiter]] and Io's [[orbital resonance]] with neighboring large moons [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], which keeps its orbit slightly [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]]. Unlike any of the planets mentioned, Io is continuously volcanically active. For example, the NASA ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' spacecraft detected nine erupting volcanoes while passing Io in 1979. Io has many calderas with diameters tens of kilometers across.&lt;ref name = "Wilson"/&gt;

'''Caribous-de-Val-d'Or Biodiversity Reserve''' ({{lang-fr|Réserve de biodiversité des Caribous-de-Val-d'Or}}) is a [[biodiversity reserve]] located in [[Abitibi-Témiscamingue]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], less than {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} southeast of the city of [[Val d'Or]]. It was established on April 28, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Réserve de biodiversité des Caribous-de-Val-d'Or|url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/Fiche.aspx?no_seq=394910|publisher=Commission de toponymie Quebec|language=French|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest lake in the reserve is [[Sabourin Lake]]. With an area of {{convert|434.19|km|abbr=on}}, it is one of the largest protected areas in Quebec.

==Geography==

Caribous-de-Val-d'Or Biodiversity Reserve is located in Abitibi-Témiscamingue between latitudes 47°45'N and 48°02'N and between longitudes 77°22'W and 77°52'W less than {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Val d'Or. It can be accessed via a major forest road (Chemin Twin) and other forest roads from the north and east via [[Quebec Route 117]]. The southwest is bordered by the [[Caribous-de-Jourdan Ecological Reserve]] and part of the southeast is bordered by the [[Ottawa River]].&lt;ref name="Val"&gt;{{cite web|title=Réserve de biodiversité des Caribous-de-Val-d'Or|url=http://www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca/biodiversite/reserves-bio/caribou/PCF_caribous_ang.pdf|publisher=[[Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (Quebec)|MDDELCC]]|format=PDF|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The purpose of the reserve is to protect the [[caribou]] (there are currently around 30 within the reserve),&lt;ref name="Val" /&gt; which was once abundant in southern Quebec. The population of caribou within the reserve is one of the most threatened in Quebec, due to a variety of factors, such as its size, fragmentation, isolation and predation by the [[wolf]]. Although the reserve itself has an area of {{convert|434.19|km2|abbr=on}}, the habitat used by the caribou extends to between {{convert|1200|km2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Val d'Or"&gt;{{cite web|title=La Réserve de biodiversité des Caribous-de-Val-d'Or|url=http://www.humanima.com/decouverte/fr/article/la-reserve-de-biodiversite-des-caribous-de-val|publisher=Humanima|language=French|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==

Other wildlife within the reserve include black lichen peatlands and spruce forests, which are essential.&lt;ref name="Val d'Or" /&gt; There are also 51 species of bird, with 43 of them nesting in the reserve; there are also cranes and [[sharp-tailed grouse]]s.&lt;ref name="Val d'Or" /&gt;

There is a huge diversity of mammals, including the [[American black bear|black bear]], [[North American porcupine]], wolf, [[lynx]], [[raccoon]], [[coyote]], [[moose]] and caribou. Within Sabourin Lake, there are twelve species of fish.&lt;ref name="Val" /&gt;

==Protective measures==

There have been protective measures within the reserve to preserve the caribou population, such as the hunting and trapping of their main predators such as black bears and wolves. The number of moose is also being reduced.&lt;ref name="Val d'Or" /&gt;

==History==
In 2007 a joint venture [[China Direct Broadcast Satellite]] was formed to runs the brand ChinaSat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadbsat.com.cn/english/profile.asp?id=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707020359/http://www.chinadbsat.com.cn/english/profile.asp?id=4|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 July 2011|title=Overview|work=Corporate Profile|publisher=China DBSAT|accessdate=11 July 2010}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinabond.com.cn/resource/1472/1488/1505/18682/21000/18612/111632/112699/7026291/12789863000731934918116.pdf|title=2007 Annual Report|date=2008|access-date=25 July 2017|work=CASC|publisher=chinabond.com.cn|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/First_Chinese_Satellite_Conglomerate_Beams_Into_Operation_999.html|title=First Chinese Satellite Conglomerate Beams Into Operation|publisher=Space Daily|date=2 January 2008|accessdate=11 July 2010|work=Xinhua News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a joint venture of state-owned companies [[China Satellite Communications]], [[China Orient Telecommunications Satellite]] and [[Sino Satellite Communications]]. The latter was controlled by [[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation]] (CASC). However, China Satellite Communications was changed from a direct subsidiary of the [[State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council]] (SASAC) to a direct subsidiary of CASC in 2009, making the joint venture was dissolved and Sino Satellite Communications became a subsidiary of China Satellite Communications.

The brand ChinaSat was previously operated by China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corporation, which was owned by China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;

The broadcast used for some shortwave [[radio jamming]] purposes in China is carried on one of the Chinasat 6B transponders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.satdirectory.com/firedrake.html |title=Firedrake - The source of China's Radio Jammer found on Chinasat 6B |publisher=Satdirectory the free-to-air satellite directory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations|ITAR]] restrictions prohibited the export of satellite components for satellites launched on Chinese rockets. In response, Thales Alenia built ChinaSat 6B as an ITAR-free satellite, containing no restricted U.S. satellite components.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent members include [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland|BUND]] (or Friends of the Earth Germany), and [[IG Bauen-Agrar-Umwelt|IG BAU]] (a multi-sector trade union).

A key issue for the Alliance is the prevention of new coal-fired power plants (the Anti-Coal Campaign).&lt;ref name="dirty-thirty-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The Alliance wants the German government to phase-out coal (''Kohleausstieg'') and promote renewable energy.

== Activities ==

=== Alternative Energy Summit ===

The Alliance organizes an Alternative Energy Summit annually to discuss energy and climate policy issues.

In a April 2016 media report over the future of [[RWE]], an Alliance expert stated that the power company had become completely unprofitable after failing to adapt to the [[Energiewende in Germany|German Energiewende]].&lt;ref name="muenten-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berlin Climate Talks ===

Since November 2015, the Alliance has organized the Berlin Climate Talks.  The format is now four per year, each with a different theme.  The launch event was devoted to civil society proposals for a more climate-friendly aviation concept for Germany.

=== Anti-Coal Campaign ===

Started in 2008, the most important campaign for the Alliance is the Anti-Coal Campaign.  The campaign coordinates and supports civil society activities to prevent new coal power plants from being built in Germany.  Coal is more carbon intensive than other fossil fuels, so that even the most advanced lignite-fired power plant discharges twice as much {{co2}} as a gas-fired power plant.  Coal power plants have a lifetime of 40–50 years and create high {{co2}} emissions throughout their lives.  Without a coal phase-out, the Alliance questions whether the German government can meet its future {{co2}} emissions targets.

Following a [[Greenpeace]] protest against [[lignite]] mining in the [[Lusatia|Lausitz]] in September 2013, a petition of 112,157 signatures in support was handed to the Lausitz authorities.  Daniela Setton, an energy policy speaker from the Alliance, commented that it was the most successful collection of signatures against a new German opencast mine ever.&lt;ref name="deutschlandradio-2013"&gt;

In July 2016, the Alliance, together with [[Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland|BUND]], the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], and the [[Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung|Rosa Luxemburg Foundation]] released a report on the aftermath of [[lignite]] mining in Germany.&lt;ref name="iass-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The report, co-authored by [[:de:Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies|IASS Potsdam]], argues that the financial resources needed to remedy the damage caused by lignite mining are not adequately backed up by the existing mining operators [[Vattenfall]] (who later sold its lignite-fired plants and mines to [[Energetický a průmyslový holding|EPH]]), [[RWE]], and [[:de:MIBRAG|MIBRAG]].

=== Global Climate Day of Action ===

For the annual Global Climate Day of Action, the Alliance organizes nationwide demonstrations for the general public, to protest at the lack of environmental awareness in politics and the economy and to encourage climate protection measures.

Alliance spokesperson Katharina Reuter, in an interview with [[Deutschlandfunk]] in December 2011, criticized the exit by [[Canada]] from the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="geers-2011"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Networking and training ===

In addition to activist activities, the Alliance mediates and maintains the substantive and tactical networks of its member organizations and with other civil society actors.  In addition, the Alliance offers its members opportunities for further development, for example through specific seminars.

The color index of an [[igneous rock]] is a measure of the ratio of dark colored, or [[mafic]], minerals to light colored, or [[felsic]], minerals.&lt;ref name="thisoldearth.net"&gt;Igneous Rock Color Index: [http://www.thisoldearth.net/Igneous-Rocks_color.cfm Igneous Rock Color Index], accessdate: March 21, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking broadly, mineral colour points out the [[specific gravity]] of the mineral, as minerals that are lighter in color tend to weigh less. Darker minerals typically tend to contain more of relatively heavy [[Chemical element|element]]s, notably [[iron]], [[magnesium]], and [[calcium]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;Britannica.com: [https://www.britannica.com/science/color-index-igneous-rock colour index | igneous rock | Britannica.com], accessdate: March 21, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community respiration''' (CR) refers to the total amount of [[CO2|carbon-dioxide]] that is produced by individuals [[organisms]] in a given
[[community]], originating from the [[cellular respiration]] of [[organic material]]. CR is an important [[ecological]] index as it dictates the amount
of production for the higher [[trophic levels]] and influence [[biogeochemical cycles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Jesse|title=Ocean-Scale Patterns in Community Respiration Rates along Continuous Transects across the Pacific Ocean|journal=PLoS One|date=2014|volume=9|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0099821}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CR is often used as a proxy for the [[biological activity]] of the microbial community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O.

The '''Energy Breakthrough''', previously known by its sponsorship name '''RACV Energy Breakthrough,''' is a joint initiative of the [[Country Education Project]], the [[Shire of Central Goldfields]] and the [[Royal Automobile Club of Victoria]] (RACV).

The main event involves a 24-hour trial in which students of secondary schools around Australia race their [[Velomobile|Human Powered Vehicles]] and Hybrid Powered People Carriers around a street circuit of 1.58 kilometres. The teams which race these vehicles consist of 8 riders, usually four male and four female participants. Leading teams can complete almost 900 kilometres in the 24-hour trial.

Other events during the Energy Breakthrough include a 14-hour HPV trial for primary school students, pushcarts, the Try-Athlon, (which consists of a sprint event, an 8-hour endurance trial and an obstacle course), and the also popular Innovations in Technology category.

=== RACV Track ===
The RACV Track is a challenging 1.58&amp;nbsp;km street circuit that reflects real-world conditions. This track is used for the Secondary HPVs, Energy Efficient Vehicles, the Try-athlon Sprint event and Obstacle course and the Pushcart Sprint event.

A lap begins with an immediate left turn out onto Napier St, then a slower left hander into Christian St, a difficult corner and a prime place for accidents. In the 2015 and 2016 layouts, halfway up the Christian St straight, riders would turn right into Burke St, then glance left into Crameri Lane, and then turn left again into the Burns St straight. This was removed for the 2017 event due to concerns about emergency access to this area during the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racveb.com/2017/11/03/racv-track-changes/|title=RACV Track Changes: New layout, speed traps, pit lane changes, and penalty display system - RACV Energy Breakthrough|website=www.racveb.com|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, like the inaugural layout, riders continue straight up Christian St, then turn into a 90 degree left hander into Burns St. The entrance to the rear pit lane is at the end of the first part of the straight. A fast right hander opens wider into a left hander and continues down the straight. In the 1991-2015 layout, the vehicles broke heavily into a tight left hander back into the park, and this corner commonly had accidents and overtakes. In 2016, as part of the Princes Park master plan, a new section was developed with a left right chicane followed by two fast left handers. This opens into the longest straight on the track. The EEV pits run for about the first 130 metres of the straight. The straight runs alongside Lake Victoria and has a few, barely noticeable kinks on the run towards turn 10. A long left turn runs alongside the front pits and up to the finish line underneath the temporary RACV bridge.

=== Vicroads (formerly Holden, then CFA) Track ===
{{Infobox motorsport venue|Name=Vicroads Track|Location=[[Maryborough, Victoria|Maryborough]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]|Time=|Image_caption=|Capacity=|Broke_ground=|Opened=2001|Events=HPV Primary 14 hour trial,

It is approximately 1.1&amp;nbsp;km long and includes a number of challenging left and right hand bends. This track is used for the HPV Primary 14 hour trial, the Try-athlon 8 hour trial and the Pushcart endurance event.

A lap of the Vicroads Track starts on the wide front straight that is on an old CFA running track. The track narrows out as pit lane traffic reenters the track. Turn 1 and 2 is a fast right left chicane that often catches riders out on the exit. Turn 3 is a left handed hairpin that opens up on exit. This is followed by a narrow right hand turn into the much wider Holyrood St. This is quickly followed a mere 50m later by turn 5, which is a left hander that turns into Park Road, the longest straight on the circuit. This straight is roughly 270m long. There is a small left kink at the start of the straight, and the rear pit lane also is located here. A 90 degree left turn is at the end of the straight, and the exit is narrow, this is the entrance back into Princes Park. A tight but quick glance to the right follows and runs into the long right hander that rides past camping areas for teams. The trickiest section of track is next. The final three corners very quickly proceed each other. Underneath the VicRoads bridge, riders enter the tight left turn, which is often overshot. From there, there is a short 30m straight along a netball court and into the left right chicane. Traffic can be an issue here as some riders enter the front pit lane. Similar to the exit of turn 2, the exit of the final corner is a common place for rollovers, as some riders go through the last corner too quick and roll their vehicle. Riders who make it through this tremendously difficult section of track blast down the straight and under the red bridge to start another lap of the Vicroads Track.

[[File:Dying Eurydice Louvre CC7.jpg|thumb|[[Charles-François Lebœuf]], ''Dying Eurydice'' (1822), [[Marble sculpture|marble]]]]{{Other use|Eurydice (disambiguation)}}
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Eurydice''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ʊəˈr|ɪ|d|ᵻ|s|i}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Εὐρυδίκη}}, ''Eurydikē''  "wide justice", derived from ''ευρυς eurys'' "wide" and ''δικη dike'' "justice”) was an oak [[nymph]] or one of the daughters of [[Apollo]]. She was the wife of [[Orpheus]], who tried to bring her back from the dead with his enchanting music.

==Canonical story==
'''Eurydice''' was the wife of [[Orpheus]], who loved her dearly; on their wedding day, he played joyful songs as his bride danced through the meadow. One day, [[Aristaeus]] saw and pursued Eurydice, who stepped on a [[Viperidae|viper]], was bitten, and died instantly. Distraught, Orpheus played and sang so mournfully that all the nymphs and deities wept and told him to travel to the [[Greek Underworld|Underworld]] to retrieve her, which he gladly did. After his music softened the hearts of [[Hades (mythology)|Hades]] and [[Persephone]], his singing so sweet that even the [[Erinyes]] wept, he was allowed to take her back to the world of the living. In another version, Orpheus played his lyre to put [[Cerberus]], the guardian of Hades, to sleep, after which Eurydice was allowed to return with Orpheus to the world of the living. Either way, the condition was attached that he must walk in front of her and not look back until both had reached the [[Upper World (Greek)|upper world]]. Soon he began to doubt that she was there, suspecting that Hades had deceived him. Just as he reached the portals of [[Hades]] and daylight, he turned around to gaze on her face, and because Eurydice had not yet crossed the threshold, she vanished back into the Underworld. When Orpheus later was killed by the [[Maenad]]s at the orders of [[Dionysus]], his soul ended up in the Underworld where he was reunited with Eurydice.

The story in this form belongs to the time of [[Virgil]], who first introduces the name of [[Aristaeus]] and the [[Greek tragedy|tragic]] outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Owen Lee]], ''Virgil as Orpheus: A Study of the Georgics'', State University of New York Press, Albany (1996), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient writers, however, speak of Orpheus's visit to the underworld in a more negative light; according to Phaedrus in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'',&lt;ref name="symposium"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text=Sym.:section=179d ''Symposium'' 179d-e].&lt;/ref&gt; the infernal deities only "presented an apparition" of Eurydice to him. [[Ovid]] says that Eurydice's death was not caused by fleeing from Aristaeus, but by dancing with [[naiad]]s on her wedding day. In fact, Plato's representation of Orpheus is that of a coward; instead of choosing to die in order to be with the one he loved, he mocked the deities by trying to go to Hades to get her back alive. Since his love was not "true"—meaning he was not willing to die for it—he was punished by the deities, first by giving him only the apparition of his former wife in the underworld and then by being killed by women.&lt;ref name="symposium" /&gt;

The story of Eurydice may be a late addition to the Orpheus myths. In particular, the name ''Eurudike'' ("she whose justice extends widely") recalls cult-titles attached to [[Persephone]]. The myth may have been derived from another Orpheus legend in which he travels to [[Tartarus]] and charms the goddess [[Hecate]].{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves, ''The Greek Myths'', Penguin Books Ltd., London (1955), Volume 1, Chapter 28, "Orpheus", p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Eurydice has a number of strong universal cultural parallels, from the [[Japanese mythology|Japanese myth]] of [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]], the [[Maya mythology|Mayan myth]] of [[Itzamna]] and [[Ixchel]], the [[India]]n myth of [[Savitri and Satyavan]], to the [[Akkadia]]n/[[Sumer]]ian myth of [[Inanna]]'s descent to the underworld. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} From the Bible, the story of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] and [[Lot's wife|his wife]] is also "often compared to the story of Orpheus and his wife Eurydike."&lt;ref&gt;Mathew Clark, ''Exploring Greek Myths'', Blackwell Publishing, Chichester (2012), Chapter 8, "The Judgment of Paris", [https://books.google.com/books?id=2gtmbI-v35sC&amp;pg=PA106 p. 106].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{in popular culture|date=March 2017}}{{more citations needed|date=March 2017}}
The story of Orpheus and Eurydice has been depicted in a number of works by artists, including [[Titian]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Nicolas Poussin]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]]&lt;ref&gt;"Orpheus Leading Eurydice from the Underworld" 1861, painting at the MFAH in Houston by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot.&lt;/ref&gt; and recently, [[Bracha Ettinger]] whose series, ''Eurydice'', was exhibited in the [[Pompidou Centre]], (''Face à l'Histoire'', 1996); the [[Stedelijk Museum]], Amsterdam (''Kabinet'', 1997) and The Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerpen (''Gorge(l)'', 2007). The story has inspired ample writings in the fields of ethics, aesthetics, art, and [[feminist theory]].

In addition, the myth has been retold in [[opera]]s by [[Jacopo Peri]], [[Monteverdi]], [[Gluck]], [[Yevstigney Fomin]], and [[Harrison Birtwistle]] (see [[List of Orphean operas]]). The myth is also the basis of [[Anais Mitchell]]'s folk opera ''[[Hadestown]]''. The story of Orpheus and Eurydice features prominently in the 1967 album ''[[Reflections (Manos Hadjidakis album)|Reflections]]'' by [[Manos Hadjidakis]], and the [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] album ''[[The Lyre of Orpheus (album)|The Lyre of Orpheus]]''.

Additionally, the story of Orpheus and Eurydice is the basis of a [[Eurydice (Ruhl play)|play]] by [[Sarah Ruhl]]. It inspired the 1959 film ''[[Black Orpheus]]'' by [[Marcel Camus]]. The myth also inspired the American playwright [[Tennessee Williams]]' 1957 drama ''[[Orpheus Descending]]''.

The '''Faculty of Agronomic and Veterinary Science''' (FSAV) at [[Loyola University of Congo]] dates back to Agro-Veterinary Higher Institute founded by the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Kinshasa]] in 1994. The purpose of its founding was to further ecologically sound and sustainable food development in the central African region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://7sur7.cd/new/2016/07/oeuvre-des-missionnaires-jesuites-luniversite-loyola-du-congo-lancee-a-kimwenza/|title=Œuvre des missionnaires jésuites : l’Université Loyola du Congo lancée à Kimwenza|date=2016-07-12|work=Le Plus grand site d'info en RDCongo|access-date=2017-10-17|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With the founding of Loyola University of Congo in 2016, ISAV was one of the two initial faculties in the new university, and was given its present name. FSAV does research in agriculture, veterinary science, and sustainable development, where sustainability involves anthropological, social, and economic factors.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Flat coast (shematic view).svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Schematic diagram of a flat coast.]]
At a '''flat coast''' or '''flat shoreline''', the land descends gradually into the [[sea]]. Flat coasts can be formed either as a result of the sea advancing into gently-sloping terrain or through the [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] of loose rock. They may be basically divided into two parallel strips: the shoreface and the [[beach]].

Flat coasts consist of loose material such as [[sand]] and [[gravel]]. [[Wind]] transports finer grains of sand inland over the [[dune]]s. The sea washes [[pebble]]s and sand away from the [[coast]] and dumps it at other locations.

== Flat coast littoral series ==
[[File:Litorale Serie Flachküste.png|thumb|Diagram of a flat coast littoral series. Key: B: bar, TNW: average low tide, THW: average high tide, US: shoreface; GS: [[foreshore]], SW: [[berm]], SR: [[Stream|runnel]], HS: [[backshore]], DG: [[dune]] belt, SK: dune cliff]]
The typical sequence of landforms created by the sea is described as a "littoral series".

=== Sandbars, runnels and creeks ===
[[File:Priel im Sahlenburger Watt.jpg|thumb|left|Wadden creek with exposed sandbar during an ebb tide]]
The littoral series of a flat coast starts in the permanently flooded shallow water region, or shoreface, with a sand or gravel [[reef]] (also called a [[sandbar|bar]]). The longshore bar is an elongated ridge of sand found parallel to the shore in the [[wave shoaling|surf]] zone on many flat coasts. It consists mainly of sand or gravel, depending on the material available along the coast. The sides of the sandbar fall gently away. The basin between a sandbar and the shore zone is called the [[Stream|runnel]] or [[swale (landform)|swale]]. The presence of a bar clearly indicates that the movement of waves is transporting and depositing material on the seabed. There may be several bars whose longitudinal axes all run parallel to the beach and which are separated by equally parallel runnels or [[stream|creeks]]. The drainage troughs in areas of [[tidal flats]] also run parallel to the coast. 

=== Shoreface and beach ===
[[File:Quinta do Lago beach 1.jpg|thumb|Start of the dune belt by the sand cliff]]
The shoreface (or underwater platform) on flat coasts encompasses in its narrow sense that area which is subject to the constant action of moving water. This means that the landward boundary between shoreface and beach is the line of the average low-water mark. However this definition is not universal and frequently varies from author to author in the literature. Whilst some define the beach as the landward transition to the shoreface that extends from the low-water mark to the highest high-water mark, i.e. the zone that is only periodically or episodically (after a [[storm surge]]) flooded by water; other authors do not use the term "beach" for the landward element of a flat coast at all. They describe the region between the mean low-water mark and the mean high-water mark of the [[tide]]s as the [[intertidal zone]] or [[foreshore]] and that area above the average high-water mark as the [[supratidal zone]] or [[backshore]] that is only directly attacked by water during storms. Because the backshore is often considerably flatter in appearance than the foreshore, which slopes clearly down towards the sea, it is also often referred to as a beach platform, which is why this part of the shore can be considered in practice to be the actual beach. The farthest point inland that is reached by storm surges is bounded by a belt of dunes, where floods can form a dune cliff.

=== Berm ===
[[File:TheGulfOfSalerno.jpg|thumb|The berm: where the gravel is no longer washed back into the sea by the backwash]]
On the beach (the beach platform) there is very often a bank of sand or a gravel ridge parallel to the shoreline and a few tens of centimetres high, known as the [[berm]]. On its landward side there is often a shallow [[wikt:runnel|runnel]]. The berm is formed by material transported by the breaking waves that is thrown beyond the average level of the sea. The coarse-grained material that can no longer be washed away by the backwash remains behind. The location and size of the berm is subject to seasonal changes. For example, a winter bern that has been thrown up by storm surges in winter is usually much more prominent and higher up the beach than berms formed by summer high tides.

== Beach losses and gains ==
[[File:Noel2007 erosion.jpg|thumb|left|Beach losses after a [[hurricane]]]]
Beaches are usually heavily [[erosion (geology)|eroded]] during [[storm surge]]s and the beach profile steepened, whereas normal wave action on flat coasts tends to raise the beach. Not infrequently a whole series of parallel berms is formed, one behind the other. There is a consequent gradual increase in height with the result that, over time, the shoreline advances seawards. A striking example of land-forming system of berms is [[Grenen|Skagen Odde]] on the northern tip of Vendsyssel in the extreme north of [[Denmark]]. This headland is still growing today as more berms are added.

[[Coastal defences]] against erosion are [[groyne]]s, [[stone walls]], or [[Tetrapod (structure)|tetrapods]] of concrete, which act as [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]]. The first plants to colonise the dunes include [[sea buckthorn]] or [[beach grass]] which prevent wind erosion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1360">The '''French Atlantic Cable Company''' (Société du Cable Transatlantique Francaise Limited) was established in 1869 to install a [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] independent of British territories. The cable ran 2,584 miles from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to [[Saint Pierre Island]] off the coast of Newfoundland, then a second leg ran 749 miles to land at [[Duxbury, Massachusetts]], near Boston. The company also installed a second cable from [[Salcombe]], on the south west coast of England, to the coast of Brittany, thereby bypassing traffic around British-owned cables across the English Channel. 

Entry into this market created a fall in trans-Atlantic telegram prices initially; the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] negotiated an operating agreement with the French company, effectively fixing prices until additional competitors entered the business. In the event of a breakdown in either company's cable, the other company agreed to temporarily carry traffic until repairs were made. &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Wagstaff BLUNDELL, ''The manual of submarine telegraph companies'' London, 1871, thanks to Google Books &lt;/ref&gt;

A second French cable company, [[Compagnie française du télégraphe de Paris à New-York]], was established in 1879 and operated until 1895.

A '''gemstone''' (also called a '''gem''', '''fine gem''', '''jewel''', '''precious stone''', or '''semi-precious stone''') is a piece of mineral [[crystal]] which, in cut and polished form, is used to make [[jewellery|jewelry]] or other [[adornment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com The Oxford Dictionary Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605183435/http://www.askoxford.com/ |date=2007-06-05 }} and [http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gemstone Webster Online Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603091355/http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gemstone |date=2007-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Simply Gemstones: Designs for Creating Beaded Gemstone Jewelry|last=Alden|first=Nancy|date=2009|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-307-45135-4|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWqLSol_bEwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] (such as [[lapis lazuli]], [[opal]], and [[jade]]) or [[organic chemistry|organic]] materials that are not minerals (such as [[amber]], [[jet (lignite)|jet]], and [[pearl]]) are also used for jewelry and are therefore often considered to be gemstones as well. Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] or other physical properties that have [[aesthetic value]]. Rarity is another characteristic that lends value to a gemstone.

Apart from jewelry, from earliest antiquity [[engraved gem]]s and [[hardstone carving]]s, such as cups, were major luxury art forms. A gem maker is called a [[lapidary]] or [[gemcutter]]; a [[diamond]] cutter is called a [[diamantaire]].

==Characteristics and classification==
{{Copypaste|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Gem.pebbles.800pix.labelled.jpg|thumb|250px|A selection of gemstone pebbles made by tumbling rough rock with abrasive grit, in a rotating drum. The biggest pebble here is {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.]]

The traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], begins with a distinction between ''precious'' and ''semi-precious''; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use the precious stones are [[diamond]], [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] and [[emerald]], with all other gemstones being semi-precious.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&amp;pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''], Max Bauer, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are  [[translucent]] with fine color in their purest forms, except for the colorless diamond, and very hard, with hardnesses of 8 to 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Other stones are classified by their color, [[translucency]] and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values, for example, while [[garnet]]s are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called [[tsavorite]] can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, pp. 3–8 {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another unscientific term for semi-precious gemstones used in [[art history]] and [[archaeology]] is [[hardstone]]. Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it deceptively implies certain stones are intrinsically more valuable than others, which is not necessarily the case.

In modern times gemstones are identified by [[gemology|gemologists]], who describe gems and their characteristics using [[technical terminology]] specific to the field of [[gemology]]. The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its [[chemical composition]]. For example, [[diamond]]s are made of [[carbon]] (C) and rubies of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}). Next, many gems are crystals which are classified by their [[crystal system]] such as [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] or [[trigonal]] or [[monoclinic]]. Another term used is [[crystal habit|habit]], the form the gem is usually found in. For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as [[octahedron]]s.

Gemstones are classified into different ''groups'', ''species'', and ''varieties''.&lt;ref name="Gem Hunt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Az2_CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT11|title=GEM HUNTER|first=George|last=Frangoulis|date=18 April 2015|publisher=Lulu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ruby is the red variety of the species [[corundum]], while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the emerald (green), [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]] (blue), [[red beryl]] (red), [[goshenite]] (colorless), [[heliodor]] (yellow) and [[morganite]] (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species [[beryl]].

Gems are characterized in terms of [[refractive index]], [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], [[specific gravity]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[fracture]] and luster. They may exhibit [[pleochroism]] or [[double refraction]]. They may have [[luminescence]] and a distinctive [[absorption spectrum]].

Material or flaws within a stone may be present as [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]].

Gemstones may also be classified in terms of their "water". This is a recognized grading of the gem's luster, transparency, or "brilliance".&lt;ref&gt;AskOxford.com Concise Oxford English dictionary online.&lt;/ref&gt; Very transparent gems are considered "[[first water]]", while "second" or "third water" gems are those of a lesser transparency.&lt;ref&gt;Desirable diamonds: The world's most famous gem. by Sarah Todd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value==
[[File:Spanish jewellery-Gold and emerald pendant at VAM-01.jpg|thumb|250px|Spanish emerald and gold pendant at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]] [[File:Pendant.jpg|thumb|250px|Enamelled gold, amethyst and pearl pendant, about 1880, Pasquale Novissimo (1844–1914), V&amp;A Museum number M.36-1928]]
There is no universally accepted grading system for gemstones. Diamonds are graded using a system developed by the [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).&lt;ref&gt;Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p.36 {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[mnemonic device]], the "four Cs" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced to help the consumer understand the factors used to grade a diamond.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weight depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. Diamonds are meant to sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called "cut". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, it is the purity and beauty of that color that is the primary determinant of quality.

Physical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual [[optical phenomena]] within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) and [[star stone|asteria]] (star effects). The Greeks, for example, greatly valued asteria gemstones, which were regarded as powerful love charms, and Helen of Troy was known to have worn star-[[corundum]].&lt;ref name=burnham&gt;{{cite book | last = Burnham | first = S.M. | title = Precious Stones in Nature, Art and Literature | publisher = Bradlee Whidden | date = 1868}} Page 251 URL: [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 Helen of Troy and star corundum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013073718/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 |date=2010-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the [[diamond]], the [[ruby]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], [[pearl]] (not, strictly speaking, a gemstone), and [[opal]]&lt;ref name=church&gt;{{cite book | last = Church | first = A.H. (Professor at Royal Academy of Arts in London) | title = Precious Stones considered in their scientific and artistic relations | publisher = His Majesty's Stationery Office, Wyman &amp; Sons | date = 1905}} Chapter 1, Page 9: ''Definition of Precious Stones'' URL: [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 Definition of Precious Stones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092547/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been considered to be precious. Up to the discoveries of bulk [[amethyst]] in Brazil in the 19th century, amethyst was considered a ''precious stone'' as well, going back to ancient Greece. Even in the last century certain stones such as [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]], [[peridot]] and cat's eye ([[cymophane]]) have been popular and hence been regarded as precious.

Today such a distinction is no longer made by the gemstone trade.&lt;ref name="WiseSecrets1" /&gt; Many gemstones are used in even the most expensive jewelry, depending on the brand name of the designer, fashion trends, market supply, treatments, etc. Nevertheless, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds still have a reputation that exceeds those of other gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;"HowStuffWorks"{{cite web |url=http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/climbing/5-most-precious-stones.htm |title=5 Most Precious Stones |accessdate=2014-11-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106143228/http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/climbing/5-most-precious-stones.htm |archivedate=2014-11-06 |df= |date=2009-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rare or unusual gemstones, generally meant to include those gemstones which occur so infrequently in gem quality that they are scarcely known except to connoisseurs, include [[andalusite]], [[axinite]], [[cassiterite]], [[clinohumite]] and [[red beryl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jewellerymonthly.com/what-is-a-gemstone/|title=A complete guide to Gemstones|last=Monthly|first=Jewellery|date=2015-04-02|work=Jewellery &amp; Watch Magazine {{!}} Jewellery news, jewellery fashion and trends, jewellery designer reviews, jewellery education, opinions {{!}} Wrist watch reviews - Jewellery Monthly|access-date=2017-08-28|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828191332/http://www.jewellerymonthly.com/what-is-a-gemstone/|archivedate=2017-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gemstone pricing and value are governed by factors and characteristics on the quality of the stone. These characteristics include clarity, rarity, freedom of defects, beauty of the stone, as well as the demand for them. There are different pricing influencers for both colored gemstones, and for diamonds. The pricing on colored stones is determined by market supply-and-demand, but diamonds are more intricate. Diamond value can change based on location, time, and on the evaluations of diamond vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Gems and Gemology|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540727958|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=50|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-72816-0_1308|chapter = Artificial treatment of gemstones|year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grading==
There are a number of laboratories which grade and provide reports on gemstones.&lt;ref name="WiseSecrets1"&gt;''Secrets of the Gem Trade; The Connoisseur's Guide to Precious Gemstones'', Richard W Wise, Brunswick House Press, Lenox, Massachusetts., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA), the main provider of education services and diamond grading reports. And also Colourstone reports.
* [[International Gemological Institute]] (IGI), independent laboratory for grading and evaluation of diamonds, jewelry and colored stones.
* [[Antwerp World Diamond Centre|Hoge Raad voor Diamant]] (HRD Antwerp), The Diamond High Council, Belgium is one of Europe's oldest laboratories. Its main stakeholder is the Antwerp World Diamond Centre.
* [[American Gemological Society]] (AGS) is not as widely recognized nor as old as the GIA.
* American Gem Trade Laboratory which is part of the American Gem Trade Association (AGTA), a trade organization of jewelers and dealers of colored stones.
* American Gemological Laboratories (AGL), owned by Christopher P. Smith.
* European Gemological Laboratory (EGL), founded in 1974 by Guy Margel in Belgium.
* Gemmological Association of All Japan (GAAJ-ZENHOKYO), Zenhokyo, Japan, active in gemological research.
* The Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (Public Organization)  or GIT, the Thailand's national institute for gemological research and gem testing, Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/international-school/24948/the-gem-and-jewelry-institute-of-thailand-public-organization-&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gemmology Institute of Southern Africa, Africa's premium gem laboratory.
* [[Asian Institute of Gemological Sciences]] (AIGS), the oldest gemological institute in South East Asia, involved in gemological education and gem testing.
* [[Swiss Gemmological Institute]] (SSEF), founded by Henry Hänni, focusing on colored gemstones and the identification of natural pearls.
* Gübelin Gem Lab, the traditional Swiss lab founded by [[Eduard Gübelin]].
* Institute for Gems and Gold Research of VINAGEMS (Vietnam), founded by Dr. Van Long Pham.

Each laboratory has its own methodology to evaluate gemstones. A stone can be called "pink" by one lab while another lab calls it "padparadscha". One lab can conclude a stone is untreated, while another lab might conclude that it is heat-treated.&lt;ref name="WiseSecrets1" /&gt; To minimise such differences, seven of the most respected labs, AGTA-GTL (New York), CISGEM (Milano), GAAJ-ZENHOKYO (Tokyo), GIA (Carlsbad), GIT (Bangkok), Gübelin (Lucerne) and SSEF (Basel), have established the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC), for the standardization of wording reports, promotion of certain analytical methods and interpretation of results. Country of origin has sometimes been difficult to determine, due to the constant discovery of new source locations. Determining a "country of origin" is thus much more difficult than determining other aspects of a gem (such as cut, clarity, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamonds.net/news/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=17766 |title=Rapaport report of ICA Gemstone Conference in Dubai |publisher=Diamonds.net |date=2007-05-16 |accessdate=2010-07-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726144914/http://www.diamonds.net/news/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=17766 |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gem dealers are aware of the differences between gem laboratories and will make use of the discrepancies to obtain the best possible certificate.&lt;ref name="WiseSecrets1" /&gt;

==Cutting and polishing==
[[File:Gemstones raw.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Raw gemstones]]
[[File:Diamond cutter. Amsterdam. 2012.jpg|thumb|right|A diamond cutter in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]] in 2012]]

A few gemstones are used as gems in the crystal or other form in which they are found. Most however, are cut and polished for usage as jewelry. The picture to the left is of a rural, commercial cutting operation in Thailand. This small factory cuts thousands of carats of sapphire annually. The two main classifications are stones cut as smooth, dome shaped stones called [[cabochon]]s, and stones which are cut with a [[faceting machine]] by polishing small flat windows called [[facet]]s at regular intervals at exact angles.

Stones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as [[opal]], [[turquoise]], [[variscite]], etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone's color or surface properties as in opal and star sapphires. Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Lapidary by Pansy D. Kraus&lt;/ref&gt;

Gems which are transparent are normally faceted, a method which shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for [[diamond cut|faceted stones]]. The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the [[optical]] properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets.&lt;ref&gt;Faceting For Amateurs by Glen and Martha Vargas&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.

==Colors==
[[File:Aurora Pyramid of Hope.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Nearly 300 variations of diamond color exhibited at [[Aurora Pyramid of Hope|the Aurora display]] at the Natural History Museum in London.]]
The color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is actually all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. A ruby appears red because it absorbs all the other colors of white light, while reflecting the red.

A material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are [[corundum]]) but exhibit different colors because of impurities. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and "fancy sapphires" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called "[[Padparadscha|padparadscha sapphire]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenaturalsapphirecompany.com/blog/padparadscha-sapphires-a-buying-guide|title=Padparadscha Sapphires : 10 Tips On Judging The Rare Gem|date=2015-04-06|work=The Natural Sapphire Company Blog|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called [[impurities]] are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected.

For example, [[beryl]], which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If [[manganese]] is added instead of [[chromium]], beryl becomes pink [[morganite]]. With iron, it becomes [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]].

Some gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be "manipulated", thus changing the color of the gem.&lt;ref name="Gem Hunt"/&gt;

==Treatment==
Gemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the stone. Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they can affect the value of the stone. Some treatments are used widely because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to the original tone.&lt;ref&gt;Gemstone Enhancement: History, Science and State of the Art by Kurt Nassau&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat===
Heat can improve gemstone color or clarity. The heating process has been well known to gem miners and cutters for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice. Most [[citrine quartz|citrine]] is made by heating [[amethyst]], and partial heating with a strong gradient results in “[[ametrine]]” – a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine. [[Aquamarine (gemstone)|Aquamarine]] is often heated to remove yellow tones, or to change green colors into the more desirable blue, or enhance its existing blue color to a purer blue.&lt;ref name=Nassau&gt;{{cite book | last = Nassau | first = Kurt | title = Gem Enhancements | publisher = Butterworth Heineman | date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all [[tanzanite]] is heated at low temperatures to remove brown undertones and give a more desirable blue / purple color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx Tanzanite Heating - The Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620222334/http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx |date=2016-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable portion of all [[sapphire]] and [[ruby]] is treated with a variety of heat treatments to improve both color and clarity.

When jewelry containing diamonds is heated (for repairs) the diamond should be protected with [[boric acid]]; otherwise the diamond (which is pure carbon) could be burned on the surface or even burned completely up. When jewelry containing [[sapphires]] or [[rubies]] is heated, those stones should not be coated with boracic acid (which can etch the surface) or any other substance. They do not have to be protected from burning, like a diamond (although the stones ''do'' need to be protected from heat stress fracture by immersing the part of the jewelry with stones in water when metal parts are heated).

===Radiation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
Virtually all [[blue topaz]], both the lighter and the darker blue shades such as "London" blue, has been [[Irradiation|irradiated]] to change the color from white to blue. Most greened quartz (Oro Verde) is also irradiated to achieve the yellow-green color. Diamonds are [[Artificially irradiated diamond|irradiated]] to produce fancy-color diamonds (which occur naturally, though rarely in gem quality).

===Waxing/oiling===
Emeralds containing natural fissures are sometimes filled with wax or oil to disguise them. This wax or oil is also colored to make the emerald appear of better color as well as clarity. Turquoise is also commonly treated in a similar manner.

===Fracture filling===
Fracture filling has been in use with different gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds and sapphires. In 2006 "glass filled rubies" received publicity. Rubies over 10 carats (2&amp;nbsp;g) with large fractures were filled with lead glass, thus dramatically improving the appearance (of larger rubies in particular). Such treatments are fairly easy to detect.

==Synthetic and artificial gemstones==
It is important to distinguish between synthetic gemstones, and imitation or simulated gems.

Synthetic gems are physically, optically and chemically identical to the natural stone, but are created in controlled conditions in a laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrESAQAAMAAJ|title=Jewelers' Circular-keystone: JCK.|date=1994|publisher=Chilton Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imitation or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone but may be optically similar to it; they can be glass, plastic, resins or other compounds.

Examples of simulated or imitation stones include [[cubic zirconia]], composed of [[zirconium]] oxide and simulated [[moissanite]], which are both [[diamond simulants]]. The imitations copy the look and color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. Moissanite actually has a higher refractive index than diamond and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will have more "fire" than the diamond.

Synthetic, cultured or lab-created gemstones are not imitations. For example, [[diamond]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s and [[emerald]]s have been manufactured in labs to possess identical chemical and physical characteristics to the naturally occurring variety. Synthetic (lab created) [[corundum]], including ruby and sapphire, is very common and costs much less than the natural stones. Smaller [[synthetic diamond]]s have been manufactured in large quantities as industrial [[abrasive]]s, although larger gem-quality synthetic diamonds are becoming available in multiple carats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Process Promises Bigger, Better Diamond Crystals|url=http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|accessdate=7 January 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201005848/http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|archivedate=1 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a gemstone is a natural stone or lab-created (synthetic), the physical characteristics are the same. Lab-created stones tend to have a more vivid color to them, as impurities are not present in a lab and do not modify the clarity or color of the stone, unless added intentionally for a specific purpose.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

A '''geosynchronous orbit''' (sometimes abbreviated '''GSO''') is an [[orbit]] around [[Earth]] of a [[satellite]] with an [[orbital period]] that matches [[Earth's rotation]] on its axis, which takes one [[sidereal day]] (23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds).&lt;ref&gt;V. Chobotov, ed., (1996) ''Orbital Mechanics, 2nd edition'', AIAA Education Series,  p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; The synchronization of rotation and orbital period means that, for an observer on Earth's surface, an object in geosynchronous orbit returns to exactly the same position in the sky after a period of one sidereal day. Over the course of a day, the object's position in the sky traces out a path, typically in a figure-8 form, whose precise characteristics depend on the orbit's [[orbital inclination|inclination]] and [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]. Satellites are typically launched in an [[prograde motion|eastward direction]].  A geosynchronous orbit is {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} above the Earth's surface. Those closer to Earth orbit faster than Earth rotates, so from Earth, they appear to move eastward while those that orbit beyond geosynchronous distances appear to move westward. 

A special case of geosynchronous orbit is the [[geostationary orbit]], which is a circular geosynchronous orbit inclined 0° to Earth's [[celestial equator|equatorial plane]] (that is, directly above the [[Equator]]). A satellite in a geostationary orbit appears stationary, always at the same point in the sky, to observers on the surface. Popularly or loosely, the term ''geosynchronous'' may be used to mean geostationary.&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Brown (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vpilMLP7OHQC&amp;pg=PA81 ''Spacecraft Mission Design, 2nd Edition,'' AIAA Education Series, p. 81]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, '''geosynchronous Earth orbit''' ('''GEO''') may be a synonym for ''geosynchronous equatorial orbit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ariane 5 User's Manual Issue 5 Revision 1 |url=http://www.arianespace.com/launch-services-ariane5/Ariane5_users_manual_Issue5_July2011.pdf |work=arianespace |accessdate=28 July 2013 |date=July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215844/http://www.arianespace.com/launch-services-ariane5/Ariane5_users_manual_Issue5_July2011.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''geostationary Earth orbit''.&lt;ref name = NASA2001/&gt; [[Communications satellite]]s are often given geostationary or close to geostationary orbits so that the [[satellite antenna]]s that communicate with them do not have to move, but can be pointed permanently at the fixed location in the sky where the satellite appears.

A [[semi-synchronous orbit]] has an orbital period of half a [[sidereal day]] (i.e., 11 hours and 58 minutes). Relative to Earth's surface, it has twice this period and hence appears to go around Earth once every day. Examples include the [[Molniya orbit]] and the orbits of the satellites in the [[Global Positioning System]].

== Orbital characteristics ==
Circular [[Earth]] geosynchronous orbits have a [[radius]] of {{convert|42164|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. All Earth geosynchronous orbits, whether circular or elliptical, have the same [[semi-major axis]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications |last=Vallado |first=David A. |year=2007 |publisher=Microcosm Press |location=Hawthorne, CA  |pages=31 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, orbits with the same period always share the same semi-major axis:

:&lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt[3]{\mu\left(\frac{P}{2\pi}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is the semi-major axis, ''P'' is the [[orbital period]], and ''μ'' is the [[geocentric gravitational constant]], equal to 398,600.4418&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

In the special case of a geostationary orbit, the [[ground track]] of a satellite is a single point on the [[equator]]. In the general case of a geosynchronous orbit with a non-zero [[inclination]] or [[Eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]], the ground track is a more or less distorted figure-eight, returning to the same places once per sidereal day.

== Geostationary orbit ==
{{Main article | Geostationary orbit}}
[[File:A geosynchronous satellite suspended above a fixed spot on the equator.PNG|thumb|A geostationary satellite above a marked spot on the Equator. An observer on the marked spot sees the satellite remain directly overhead, unlike other celestial objects, which sweep across the sky.]]A geostationary equatorial orbit (GEO) is a circular geosynchronous orbit in the plane of the Earth's equator with a radius of approximately {{convert|42164|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} (measured from the center of the Earth). A satellite in such an orbit is at an altitude of approximately {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} above mean sea level. It maintains the same position relative to the Earth's surface. If one could see a satellite in geostationary orbit, it would appear to hover at the same point in the sky, i.e., not exhibit [[diurnal motion]], while the Sun, Moon, and stars would traverse the skies behind it. The theoretical basis for this novel phenomenon of the sky goes back to Newton's theory of motion and gravity. In that theory, the existence of a geostationary satellite is made possible because the Earth rotates (with respect to an inertial frame in which Newton's laws of motion and gravity hold). However, as a practical device, the geostationary satellite owes much for its realisation to [[Arthur C. Clarke]] who proposed it during the 20th century and in whose honour the orbit is called a Clarke orbit. Such orbits are useful for [[telecommunications satellite]]s.

A perfectly stable geostationary orbit is an ideal that can only be approximated. In practice the satellite drifts out of this orbit because of perturbations such as the [[solar wind]], [[radiation pressure]], variations in the Earth's gravitational field, and the [[gravity|gravitational]] effect of the [[Moon]] and [[Sun]], and thrusters are used to maintain the orbit in a process known as [[orbital station-keeping|station-keeping]].

== Other geosynchronous orbits ==
[[Elliptic orbit|Elliptical]] geosynchronous orbits are used in [[communications satellite]]s to keep the satellite in view of its assigned ground stations and receivers. A satellite in an elliptical geosynchronous orbit appears to oscillate in the sky from the viewpoint of a ground station, tracing an [[analemma]] in the sky. Satellites in highly elliptical orbits must be tracked by steerable [[ground station]]s.

The [[Infrared Space Observatory]] was in a highly elliptical geosynchronous orbit with an [[orbital height]] of apogee 70,600&amp;nbsp;km and perigee 1,000&amp;nbsp;km.  It was controlled by two ground stations.

[[Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System|NAVIC]] is a regional — i.e. non-global — Indian navigation system currently operating with 7 satellites, of which 3 are in geostationary orbit and 4 in geosynchronous orbit.

The [[Quasi-Zenith Satellite System]] (QZSS) is a three-satellite regional [[time transfer]] system and enhancement for [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], covering [[Japan]] at high elevation from a [[Tundra orbit]].
 
An active geosynchronous orbit is a hypothetical orbit that could be maintained if forces other than gravity were also used, such as a [[solar sail]]. Such a [[statite]] could be geosynchronous in an orbit different (higher, lower, more or less elliptical, or some other path) from the [[conic section]] orbit dictated by the laws of gravity.

A further form of geosynchronous orbit is proposed for the theoretical [[space elevator]], in which one end of the structure is tethered to the ground, maintaining a shorter orbital period than by gravity alone if under tension.

Other related orbit types are:

* [[Supersynchronous orbit]]: a disposal / storage orbit above GSO/GEO.  Satellites drift in a westerly direction.
* [[Subsynchronous orbit]]: a drift orbit close to but below GSO/GEO.  Used for satellites undergoing station changes in an eastern direction.
* [[Graveyard orbit]]: a supersynchronous orbit where spacecraft are intentionally placed at the end of their operational life.

== Other synchronous orbits ==
{{Main article | Synchronous orbit}}
[[File:Syncom 2 side.jpg|Syncom 2|thumb|upright]]
Synchronous orbits can only exist for bodies that have a fixed surface (e.g. moons, rocky planets).  Without such a surface (e.g. gas giants, black holes) there is no fixed point an orbit can be said to synchronise with.  No synchronous orbit exists if the body rotates so slowly that the orbit would be outside its [[Hill sphere]], or so quickly that it would be inside the body.  Large bodies held together by gravity cannot rotate that quickly, since they would fly apart, so the last condition only applies to small bodies held together by other forces, e.g. smaller asteroids.  Most inner moons of planets have [[synchronous rotation]], so their synchronous orbits are, in practice, limited to their leading and trailing ({{L4}} and {{L5}}) [[Lagrange point]]s, as well as the {{L1}} and {{L2}} Lagrange points, assuming they do not fall within the body of the moon. Objects with [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] rotations, such as exhibited by [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]], are also problematic, as their synchronous orbits change unpredictably.

== History ==

[[File:Clarke sm.jpg|thumb|upright|Author [[Arthur C. Clarke]]]]
Author [[Arthur C. Clarke]] is credited with proposing the notion of using a geostationary orbit for communications satellites.&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Clarke, "Extra-Terrestrial Relays", ''Wireless World'', Vol. 51, No. 10, pp. 305–308, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; The orbit is also known as the '''Clarke Orbit'''.  Together, the collection of artificial satellites in these orbits is known as the '''Clarke Belt'''.

The first communications satellite placed in a geosynchronous orbit was [[Syncom 2]], launched in 1963. However, it was in an [[inclined orbit]], still requiring the use of moving antennas.  The first communications satellite placed in a geostationary orbit was [[Syncom 3]].  Geostationary orbits have been in common use ever since, in particular for satellite [[television]].

Geostationary satellites also carry international telephone traffic but they are being replaced by fiber optic cables in heavily populated areas and along the coasts of less developed regions, because of the greater bandwidth available and lower latency, due to the inherent disconcerting delay in communicating via a satellite in such a high orbit. It takes electromagnetic waves about a quarter of a second to travel from one end to the other end of the link. Thus, two parties talking via satellite are subject to about a half second delay in a round-trip message/response sequence.

Although many populated land locations on the planet now have terrestrial communications facilities ([[microwave]], [[fiber-optic]]), even undersea, with more than sufficient capacity,  telephone and Internet access is still available only via satellite in many places in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, as well as isolated locations that have no terrestrial facilities, such as [[Canada]]'s Arctic islands, [[Antarctica]], the far reaches of [[Alaska]] and [[Greenland]], and ships at sea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49865">A '''green museum''' is a [[museum]] that incorporates concepts of [[sustainability]] into its operations, programming, and facility. Many green museums, but not all, use their collections to produce exhibitions, events, classes, and other programming to educate the public about the [[natural environment]]. Many, but not all, green museums reside in a building featuring [[sustainable architecture]] and technology. Green museums interpret their own sustainable practices and green design to present a model of behavior.

Green museums strive to help people become more conscious of their world, its limitations, and how their actions affect it. The goal is to create positive change by encouraging people to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. They use their position as community-centered institutions to create a culture of sustainability.

==Definitions==

===Museum===
[[Museums]] make a "unique contribution to the public by collecting, preserving, and interpreting the things of this world," according to the [[American Alliance of Museums]]’ Code of Ethics. There are many types of museums that specialize in various fields, including [[anthropology]], [[art]], [[history]], [[natural history]], [[science]], and can have living collections such as [[public aquariums]], [[botanical gardens]], [[nature center]]s, and [[zoos]], or no collections like [[planetarium]]s, and [[children's museums]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aam-us.org/ ''American Alliance of Museums''] Retrieved 20 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums are stewards of [[natural heritage]] and [[cultural heritage]] by preserving objects of importance to mankind on the community and global level. Museums communicate and contribute to knowledge. They are mission-driven, serve the public, and usually have [[nonprofit]] legal status.

===Green===
In the concept of green museums, the word green means environmentally thoughtful practice. The terms "green" and "sustainable" are [[buzzwords]] and often used interchangeably. However, according to Brophy and Wylie, "green" and "sustainable" have distinctly different definitions. "Green refers to products and behaviors that are environmentally benign, [...] while sustainable means practices that rely on renewable or reusable materials and processes that are green or environmentally benign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brophy, Wylie|first=Sarah S., Elizabeth|title=The Green Museum: A Primer on Environmental Practice|year=2008|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7591-1164-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another frequently cited definition for "sustainability" that is used in various contexts was developed by the [[United Nations]] (1987): "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/42/ares42-187.htm "Report of the World Commission on environment and development. General Assembly Resolution 42/187, December 11, 1987," ''United Nations''] Retrieved 21 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability reflects a complex system where components are closely linked and do not exist in isolation from one another. A sustainable system affects and is affected by the individual and collective behaviors of its members. Sustainability therefore recognizes the [[human impact on the environment]], and aims to mitigate negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;Worts, D. (2006). Fostering a culture of sustainability. ''Museums &amp; social issues,'' vol.1, no. 2, Fall 2006, pp. 151-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture of sustainability===
Green museums promote a culture of sustainability. [[Culture]] forms and holds humanity’s deepest values, attitudes, and actions. Sustainability asks people to adapt at a cultural level, changing their beliefs and behavior (Worts, 2006). Museums are in a unique role to establish and promote a culture of sustainability. "In their role as places of authority and keepers of culture, museums have unequaled power and responsibility to model and to teach the methods of preserving ourselves, our planet and our cultural resources" (45).&lt;ref&gt;Brophy, S. &amp; Wylie, E. (2006). It’s easy being green: Museums and the green movement. ''Museum News,'' September/October 2006, pp. 38-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:CalifAcadamyOfSciAug28-2008img0640.JPG|thumb|none|600px|&lt;center&gt;The [[California Academy of Sciences]] uses native plantings on its [[green roof]] to reduce heating and cooling energy requirements and contains many other energy and water saving features. It has been widely recognized as likely the "greenest" building currently on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;''California'' (magazine of the University of California Alumni Association), Sept/Oct 2008, cover and pp. 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]&lt;/center&gt;

==History==

Green museums are a relatively new phenomena. Discussions within museums circles about environmental sustainability began in the 1990s and have continued to grow in momentum to the present day. Currently, green museums are receiving a lot of attention from [[academia]] and the [[mass media]]. Some scholars believe that a focus on sustainability is a way for museums to be relevant in the 21st century (Brophy &amp; Wylie, 2006). However, most conventional museums are not engaged in sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;Sutter, G. C. (2006). Thinking like a system: Are museums up to the challenge? ''Museums &amp; social issues,'' vol.1, no. 2, Fall 2006, pp. 203-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

The green museum movement began in science and children’s museums. Science museums found that environmental advocacy and education fit easily within their missions and programming. Children’s museums saw that using green design in their inside environments created a healthy playground for their young visitors. Once sustainability became a topic of discussion in museum circles, zoos and aquariums realized that their existing missions and programming of species conservation was in essence sustainable education.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, E. &amp; Brophy, S.S. (2008). The greener good: The enviro-active museum. ''Museum,'' January/February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums revised its accreditation standards to include a requirement of environmental advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aza.org/ ''Association of Zoos and Aquariums.''] Retrieved 20 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
With the green museum movement beginning in Children's Museums, The Children's Discovery Museum in Normal, IL, became the first LEED-certified Children's Museum on October 3, 2005, when it received a Silver certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Green Museum|url=http://www.childrensmuseums.org/docs/GreenChildrensMuseums.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Wild Center]] in Tupper Lake, NY was the first LEED-certified green museum in New York, followed by The [[Brooklyn Children's Museum]] which became the first LEED-certified museum in New York City in 2008, using [[renewable resource|rapidly renewable]] and [[recycled]] features such as bamboo and recycled rubber flooring. The museum also uses [[photovoltaics]] to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inhabitat|url=http://inhabitat.com/the-renovated-brooklyn-childrens-museum/|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Children's Museum]] is also a good example of a green museum leader, after receiving a LEED Gold certification in 2007, as well as the [[Pittsburgh Children's Museum]], which received a LEED Silver certification in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;https://pittsburghkids.org/about/green-museum&lt;/ref&gt;

Science museums and zoos were quick to follow Children's Museums in the green movement. One of the first science museums to adopt green initiatives was [[ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake Champlain]] in Burlington, Vermont, which was the first [[LEED certified]] building in Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brophy S. &amp; Wylie E.|title=The Green Museum|year=2008|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7591-1165-3|pages=13, 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Natural History Museum of Utah is another museum which has taken charge in the green museum movement. They are applying for a LEED Gold certification, and are expected to save over $22,000 in energy costs. At their Rio Tinto Center, the museum will have such integrated design features as an educational energy trail to tell the whole story of energy, as well as a renewable energy system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth Techling|url=http://www.earthtechling.com/2011/06/utah-natural-history-museum-gets-greener/|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoos and Botanical Gardens have also become leaders in the Green Museum field. The Denver Zoo, Woodland Park Zoo, and Cincinnati Zoo all received Green Awards at the 2011 [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AZA.org|url=http://www.aza.org/honors-awards/|accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Phipps Conservatory &amp; Botanical Gardens]] was given a LEED silver certification for its new Welcome Center, which "is designed to evoke the geometry of the historic glass houses behind it." It has 11,000 square feet of lobby, ticketing, gift shop, and cafe space with a 34&amp;nbsp;ft high glass dome that is insulated to control glare and heat. Architects partially built the structure into the terrain, with 14th feet of usable space below ground. It was determined that by doing this, Phipps would save 40-50% of annual energy costs compared with an entirely above ground structure, and demonstrated that sustainable design could be created in ways that were still sympathetic to historic settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Architecture News|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=13901|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phipps will also be opening the Center for Sustainable Landscapes, which will house a center for education, research, and administration. It is scheduled to open in the spring of 2012, and is planned to exceed the LEED platinum certification, and achieve the [[Living Building Challenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phipps|url=http://phipps.conservatory.org/project-green-heart/green-heart-at-phipps/center-for-sustainable-landscapes.aspx|accessdate=13 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111075503/http://phipps.conservatory.org/project-green-heart/green-heart-at-phipps/center-for-sustainable-landscapes.aspx|archivedate=11 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Museums are now also joining the movement. The [[Grand Rapids Art Museum]] became the world's first LEED certified art museum complex in 2008 when it received LEED Gold certification, which such innovative features as a heat recovery ventilator, CO2 sensors, and on site grey water reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ziger/Snead|url=http://www.zigersnead.com/current/blog/post/worlds-first-leed-museum-complex-grand-rapids-art-museum/03-23-2008/947/|accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Network|url=http://network-green.org/gram-leed-award/|accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now all types of museums of all sizes are becoming green. In the last decade, over 20 American museums have constructed a new green building or have renovated an existing building with sustainable features. Many others have developed green operations or programming. Some scholars believe that environmental sustainability will become a professional expectation for all museums in the future (Wylie &amp; Brophy, 2008).

One specific example of a "Green Museum" is The [[Toledo Zoo]] in Toledo, Ohio. In 2007, the institution redefined its mission statement to focus on inspiring and informing the public about [http://www.toledozoo.org/conservation/index.html conservation].&lt;ref name="Building Green at the Toledo Zoo"&gt;Klinger, Eric. "Building Green at the Toledo Zoo". http://www.aza.org/Membership/detail.aspx?id=778.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of their new mission, the Toledo Zoo committed to green construction, which was shown in the parking lot renovation project. The main parking lot was redesigned in order to increase parking capacity and aid traffic flow, and the project incorporated green elements such as [[rain garden]]s and reusing concrete. The renovation also included a residential-sized [[wind turbine]] and three solar panels to power the ticket booths at the park's entrance.&lt;ref name="Building Green at the Toledo Zoo" /&gt; The wind-turbine and solar panels generate 3600 kilowatt hours per year, which can be redirected into the zoo's main power grid when the booths are not in use and reduce the zoo's carbon footprint by 5600 pounds annually.&lt;ref name="Building Green at the Toledo Zoo" /&gt;

Another project at the Toledo Zoo is the Solar Walk. The Solar Walk opened in November 2010 and includes over 1400 solar panels that produce 104,000 kilowatt hours per year, the same amount of energy used by ten typical homes in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, Elise. "Going Green". August 18, 2011.  http://zooexplorer.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/going-green/.&lt;/ref&gt; The Toledo Zoo and the Solar Walk's design team wanted the project to be a visual reminder to all zoo visitors and traffic from nearby highway of the zoo's commitment to conservation. In order to accomplish the project, the Toledo Zoo turned to a local companies, and used funds from private contributions and an energy grant from [http://www.development.ohio.gov/ ODOD] to cover the $14,750,000 price.&lt;ref name="Walking on sunshine"&gt;Grahl, Cindy. "Toledo Zoo Solar Walk: Walking on sunshine". http://www.bxmagazine.com/article.asp?ID=1156.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, The Toledo Zoo, in keeping with their mission statement, included informational panels on how the Solar Walk works and the amount of energy produced to date, so that visitors can be informed on the conservational value of the project.&lt;ref name="Walking on sunshine"/&gt; The Solar Walk will reduce the Zoo's carbon footprint by over 75 metric tons each year, which is equivalent to 15 medium-sized cars.&lt;ref&gt;Raghuveer, Amulya. "Toledo Zoo dedicates new SolarWalk". http://www.northwestohio.com/news/story.aspx?id=541642.&lt;/ref&gt; The Toledo Zoo has further committed to incorporate green construction into its building plans through [[geothermal]] wells, environmentally friendly insulation and other [[renewable energy]] and green construction materials.&lt;ref name="Building Green at the Toledo Zoo" /&gt;

==Green exhibits==
Museums are taking a more active approach to the project development of their exhibits. Children's museums initiated the green museum movement, mainly out of health concerns for the young visitors. Using toxic materials and chemicals on structures intended for children became a high worry for both the museum staff and parents. "In its 2004 expansion project the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh used only adhesives, sealants, paints, carpets, and composite wood that are certified formaldehyde free with near-zero off-gassing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brophy, Wylie|first=Sarah S., Elizabeth|title=The Green Museum: A Primer on Environmental Practice|year=2008|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7591-1164-6|pages=88–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the ''reduce, reuse, recycle'' mantra became mainstream, a small number of museums had already begun promoting sustainable decision making thru exhibits. One museum in particular, the [[Boston Children's Museum]], developed a concept known as "[[The Recycle Shop]]". In 1970, this exhibit promoted the benefits of using manufactured waste materials, and turning them into artistic creations. Students, teachers, and the general public were allowed to collect art materials not otherwise found in regular stores. The Recycle Shop closed its doors after several years in operation, due to the recycling program that was later introduced across the United States.

Throughout the last several years, exhibit designers have expanded their businesses by building eco-friendly exhibits. Using environmentally safe materials such as low [[Volatile Organic Compound]] (VOC) paints, formadelhyde-free wood products and fiberwood (composite wood) are the trademark tools for defining green exhibits. Some exhibit furniture products are also constructed to be shipped for [[Ready-to-assemble furniture|flat packing]]. This helps to decrease shipping costs, reduce packing material, increase fuel efficiency which minimizes the overall carbon footprint of the exhibition.

How does a museum understand the criteria that is required, needed to build green exhibits? Organizations are working to develop a standard rating system, for the specific needs of green exhibitions. In 2007, Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) created an aid to help museums assess the sustainability of their exhibits. OMSI, a scientific, educational, and cultural resource center looked to the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, to create the [[OMSI Green Exhibit Certification]].

The guide provides a checklist for organizations who follows eight elements regularly used in exhibit design. After evaluation, they are awarded 0-4 points:

# Rapidly Renewable Materials
# Resource Reuse
# Recycled Content
# End-life Assessment
# Low-Emitting Materials
# Certified Wood
# Conservation
# Regional Materials

There are other guides and checklists available online for museums that want to be active participants in the green community. The [[Madison Children's Museum]] in Madison, WI developed a checklist for museum exhibit designers and fabricators to create exhibits that showcase best practices for a healthier environment. [[Exhibit SEED]] is a larger project funded by the National Science Foundation titled ''Sustainability: Promoting Sustainable Decision Making in Informal Education''.

==Issues==

===Mission===
Some scholars suggest that sustainability and green design are a natural extension of a museum's [[mission statement]]. Some museums choose to make sustainability a central part of their identity, writing their commitment to being green in their mission statements. Sustainability can be seen as relating to three aspects included in most museum missions: field of research, purpose of public service, and the mandate for education. Museums that model green behavior enhance their missions and support their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, M. J. &amp; Sutter, G. C. (2006). A youth forum on sustainability meets The Human Factor: Challenging cultural narratives in schools and museums. ''Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education,'' January 2006, 9-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all green museums feel sustainability directly aligns with their missions. For example, an [[art museum]] that resides in green building and does not interpret its sustainable practices can be considered a green museum.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, F. A. (2007). From Michigan: A clean-running museum. ''The New York Times,'' Wednesday, March 28, 2007, H 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
As informal [[education]] centers that serve the public, museums are in a position to teach about sustainability to a large audience in meaningful ways. Through a combination of motivation and information, green museums try to initiate changes in behavior in people’s everyday lives. Green museums lead by example by explaining to visitors what sustainable activities they are doing and why through signage, programming, and websites. The goal is that visitors will learn about sustainable practices at the museum and then be able to implement them at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenexhibits.org/ ''greenexhibits.org''] Retrieved June 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many museums dedicated to sustainability and conservation education often utilize the works of theorists like [[Richard Louv]] and [[David Sobel]] to find the most effective ways to motivate their audiences to conservation action.  For instance, Disney's Animal Kingdom cites [[Richard Louv|Richard Louv's]] [[Nature deficit disorder|Nature Deficit Disorder]] as one justification for their Kids' Discovery Clubs, which focuses on encouraging children to not only learn about animals but also find out what they can do to help wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;Balavage, S. Dr. Heimlich, J. Kocanjer, N. Lehnhardt, K. Dr. Mellen, J. ''Assessing young Children's Learning within an informal setting at Disney's Kid's Discovery Clubs'', [http://www.izea.net/education/journal%2045%202009-assessing%20young%20childrens%20learning%20within%20an%20informal%20setting%20kdcs.pdf IZE Journal NR. 25 - 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Another museum to cite Louv's Nature Deficit Disorder for their programming is the [http://naturalsciences.org/ North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences]. They spearheaded the national Take a Child Outside Week, which encourages children and adults to spend time together outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Sarah Lindenfeld|title=Take a Child Outside Week starts Saturday|url=http://www.wral.com/lifestyles/goaskmom/blogpost/10153119/|publisher=WRAL.com|date=20 September 2011|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many museums also approach sustainability issues with [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ecophobia Ecophobia] in mind.  Ecophobia is [[David Sobel|David Sobel's]] theory that if you introduce abstract and difficult environmental issues to children at too early of an age, and with out the proper background knowledge, they will retreat from nature.&lt;ref&gt;Diane M McKnight. 2010. ''Overcoming “ecophobia”: fostering environmental empathy through narrative in children's science literature.'' [http://www.esajournals.org/doi/full/10.1890/100041?prevSearch=%5BAllField%3A+ecophobia%5D&amp;searchHistoryKey= Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 8: e10–e15.]&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a museum attempting to overcome [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ecophobia Ecophobia] would be one that promotes a love of nature and presents a variety of actions guests can take to help the environment before presenting them with more controversial and abstract environmental and sustainability issues.  The [[Brooklyn Children's Museum]]s respects the developmental stages of children by using their [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified building to teach children and their families about environmental conservation through interactive, age appropriate exhibits and activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biodiversityllc.com/PDF/MayJun04-Full.pdf Biodiversity]. ''The Brooklyn Children's Museum Goes Green.'' May–June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social responsibility===
In recent years, calls for museums to become sustainable institutions have come from within the museum field as a way for museums to achieve [[social responsibility]] and [[civic engagement]]. Sustainability is an opportunity for thoughtful, proactive museum work. "Museums can play a critical role in moving the communities they serve towards a more sustainable future. Aligning their missions and programs with sustainability principles... ...will recalibrate their own daily practices as well as awaken their community to the array of choices perhaps otherwise invisible to them" (183).&lt;ref&gt;Link, T. (2006). Models of sustainability: Museums, citizenship, and common wealth. ''Museums &amp; social issues,'' vol.1, no. 2, Fall 2006, pp. 173-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums, as a trusted part of the informal education system, are able to address the economic, cultural, and social dimensions of sustainability.&lt;ref name="Promoting Sustainability"&gt;Sutter, Glenn C. “Promoting Sustainability: Audience and Curatorial Perspectives on 	“The Human Factor.”” Curator 51, no. 2 (April 2008): 187-202.&lt;/ref&gt; They achieve this by engaging the public with interactive exhibits and by publicizing their own green efforts. The goal, stated or unstated, is to educate patrons about the effect they have on their environment, the ecological, economic, and cultural risks taken when they ignore their impact on the world, and introduce ways that they can reduce their carbon footprint. Thus, museums achieve civic engagement and social responsibility through teaching.

Some museums, such as the [[Royal Saskatchewan Museum]] in Saskatchewan, Canada, take a global approach to civic engagement. The Royal Saskatchewan Museum's green exhibit is titled ''The Human Factor'' and aims to show patrons the human ecological impact on the planet, what practices they can adopt to lessen this impact, and project what the future will be if humans do not take action.&lt;ref name="Promoting Sustainability" /&gt; Visitors are helped to understand what Earth looked like before humans and gradual human impact over time through colorful depictions in the "Time Tunnel".&lt;ref name="Promoting Sustainability" /&gt; The subsequent gallery, "Living Planet", explains how a global ecosystem functions and what human stresses are to the Earth's global ecosystem on a rotating globe.&lt;ref name="Promoting Sustainability" /&gt; Specifically identified as a stress to the global ecosystem is the rising population. Curators placed clocks in the exhibit that count increases in population across the globe.&lt;ref name="Promoting Sustainability" /&gt; Beneath the clocks are the forms of humans and in their shadow is the images of industrial productivity.&lt;ref name="Promoting Sustainability" /&gt; The following gallery, "Causes of Stress," identifies the source of ecological stresses as rampant consumerism and explains what causes this extreme behavior.&lt;ref name="Promoting Sustainability" /&gt; The solutions gallery depicts sustainable development and an electronic display of sustainability success stories. This is an effort to show patrons how their choices impact not only themselves and their parts of the world but other people and their environments. The last gallery, "Looking Ahead," describes the projected future of the globe if humans adopt the prescribed changes.&lt;ref name="Promoting Sustainability" /&gt; The desired effect is an emotional response to the human impact on the global ecosystem.

[[Bronx Zoo|The Bronx Zoo]] seeks to educate its patrons about water resources and the impact of restroom use on water resources through the EcoRestroom exhibit. At the same time, by installing this restroom with composting toilets the Zoo has reduced its carbon footprint. The restroom serves men and women with 12 toilets and six sinks for women and two toilets, four waterless urinals and four sinks for men.&lt;ref name="Interpreting a Green Scene" &gt;Bhatt, Sonal. “Interpreting a Green Scene: The Bronx Zoo’s Eco-Restroom.” Exhibitionist (Spring 2009): 39-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The sinks do not rely on electricity or battery power; rather, they recharge as water runs through them. The used water runs into a Grey Water garden that is unharmed by the bio-compatible soap available for use by patrons.&lt;ref name="Interpreting a Green Scene" /&gt; The restroom doubles as exhibition space, informing visitors of water conservation. Along the pathway to the entrance of the restroom there are water-droplet-shaped signs that give visitors tips for conserving and repurposing water at home.&lt;ref name="Interpreting a Green Scene" /&gt; Signs continue over the sinks, providing visitors with facts about water use meant to inspire thought about their own use and what they can do to use less water. Signs on the inside of the stall doors inform visitors how composting toilets function and the impact they have on the environment.&lt;ref name="Interpreting a Green Scene" /&gt; This installation not only shows patrons how they can make simple changes to conserve water but implements those changes in real time at the Zoo. In educating, the Zoo is also making a difference.

As stewards of the public trust, Museums bear a responsibility to maintain collections utilizing the most efficient methods available. Museums must do their part to ensure that there is a public to enjoy the collection and resources to exhibit the collection. One way museums can conserve resources is to incorporate energy saving practices into their daily operations, altering the facilities they already inhabit rather than building anew.&lt;ref name="Saving Collections and the Planet"&gt;Brophy, Sarah S. and Elizabeth Wylie. “Saving Collections and the Planet.” Museum 88, no. 6 (November/ December 2009): 52-7, 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Brophy and Wylie identify simple solutions such as installing motion sensors that turn the lights on when visitors enter the gallery and turn the lights off when they exit, such as those found at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia.&lt;ref name="Saving Collections and the Planet" /&gt; Those lightbulbs could even be replaced with long-lasting LED bulbs.Other museums that manipulate their facilities location include the [[Morgan Library]], as identified by Brophy and Wylie, whose storage is "carved out of Manhattan bedrock."&lt;ref name="Saving Collections and the Planet" /&gt; The bedrock provides natural cool storage without using electricity to generate an air conditioned climate. Thus neither money nor electricity are spent to control the climate of the storage space, which stresses not only museum funds but increasingly scarce electricity too.

Museums further achieve social responsibility by implementing the sustainable practices that they advocate in building or altering facilities such that they are sustainable.This includes using [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] building practices and sourcing materials locally. Purchasing building materials and employing local labor stimulates the economy in the vicinity of the museum. It also reduces the carbon footprint of construction; materials purchased from local suppliers do not need to be delivered on a tractor-trailer, on an airplane, or on a ship, all of which consume fuel, time and money. The Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver, CO, has incorporated locally sourcing materials into its LEED-Gold design plan.&lt;ref name="The Art of Sustainability" &gt;Mirel, Diana. "The Art of Sustainability." Journal of Property Management 73, no. 4 (Jul/Aug 2008): 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum highlights that its green roof, furniture fixtures and equipment have all been locally sourced.&lt;ref name="The Art of Sustainability" /&gt; The museum also encourages the use of public transportation by offering discounts to visitor who use this as a means of accessing the museum.&lt;ref name="The Art of Sustainability" /&gt; In building to the LEED Gold standard, the Museum of Contemporary Art has also made its operations more energy efficient. The facade is built to maximize climate control and limit the use of traditional forced air.&lt;ref name="The Art of Sustainability" /&gt; Radiant flooring circulates heat around the perimeter of the building. These are two ways that MCA Denver conserves energy. The Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego purchased paint, office furnishings, windows and doors from local vendors.&lt;ref&gt;"Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego." Architectural Record 195, no. 6 (June 2007): 66.&lt;/ref&gt; By educating the community and putting advocacy into action, museums become socially responsible.

==Landscapes and outdoor spaces==
One approach green museums are taking to improve sustainability is to consider their outdoor spaces and landscape design. Greening outdoor spaces provides multiple benefits beyond aesthetics and museums are increasingly using their outdoor spaces to further sustainable strategies and educational goals. According to the [[National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities]], there are many types of educational, recreational, and social skills that may be successfully taught outdoors.&lt;ref name="education"&gt;Gordon, Douglas. Cheryl Wagner. Planning School Grounds for Outdoor Learning. National Clearing House for Educational Facilities. October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor museum spaces include pathways, trails, pavilions, picnic areas, fountains, courtyards, waste management areas, rooftops, and the greater surrounding environment. Whether a new facility or an existing one, green museums use these outdoor areas to implement sustainable practices.  For instance, incorporating native plants, [[wetlands]], [[bioswales]], [[rain garden]]s, butterfly gardens, vegetable gardens, and [[green roofs]] are all ways museums can maximize the use of, and green their grounds. Additionally, the natural surrounding environment can be an integral part of the green museum (where the land is part of the museum). Incorporating these outdoor spaces provides a more flexible learning environment with greater educational opportunities.&lt;ref name="education"/&gt; Outdoor spaces allow for hands-on projects that promote environmental awareness and are an ideal catalyst for community involvement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;SITES, "Michigan Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects" Volume 5 Number 1. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, green museums are incorporating [[sustainable]] thinking in their outdoor planning.  For example, the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum designed a rooftop that won the 2003 Chicago Green Roof Award. The living portion of the roof reduces the volume of storm water runoff and solar panels generate electricity used by the museum below.&lt;ref&gt;http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=resources/lifestyle_community&amp;id=7446270&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.pittsburghbotanicgarden.org/garden/reclamation/ Pittsburgh Botanic Garden] is working on a reclamation project to heal its land that was once used for coal mining. The project allows the garden to tell a story of ecological change and the importance of restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Talkin’ Dirt with Greg Nace. Fine Gardening Magazine. October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the summertime, Walker Art Museum uses its outdoor space, [http://blogs.walkerart.org/openfield2011/ Open Field], for public programs and as a gathering place that brings together imagination, recreation, relaxation, and exploration.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.walkerart.org/openfield2011/&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://umnh.utah.edu/home Natural History Museum of Utah] prides itself on being a model for environmental sustainability. The exterior of the facility was designed to respect and reflect the natural world by blending in with the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://sierraclub.typepad.com/greenlife/2011/09/inspired-by-the-landscape-the-natural-history-museum-of-utah.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to quantify the performance of outdoor spaces is important to be a trusted example in the green museum community. There are multiple rating systems and interactive tools online and there is a growing consultancy field aimed at helping museums audit, develop baselines, and benchmark their performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brophy, Wylie|first=Sarah S., Elizabeth|title=The Green Museum: A Primer on Environmental Practice|year=2008|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7591-1164-6|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; One strategy for museums going green is to become [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Certificated. In 2000, the [[US Green Building Council]] (USGBC) introduced the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system that ranks sustainability in buildings and operations. To date, LEED is focused mostly on structures and development, while landscape issues are minimally addressed. The [http://www.sustainablesites.org/ Sustainable SITES Initiative (SITES)] is a new benchmark and rating system that was created, as a joint venture by the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], the [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]] and the [[United States Botanic Garden]]. Modeled after the LEED program, SITES is a work in progress to establish benchmarks and a rating system that addresses site selection, landscape design, construction, operations, maintenance and monitoring.  Currently SITES is in the pilot project phase, and will be completed in June 2012.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In November 2009, SITES released "Guidelines and Performance Benchmarks 2009" for the pilot projects which includes the rating system with five areas of focus; hydrology, soils, vegetation, materials, and human health and well-being. While LEED focuses on energy, the key to SITES is [[ecosystem services]].&lt;br /&gt;  Ecosystem services are benefits provided by natural ecosystems such as:
*Climate regulation
*Clean air, soil, water
*Water supply regulation
*Soil erosion / sediment control
*Habitat and pollination
*Decomposed waste integration
*Human health and well being
*Food and organic products
*Cultural, educational, and aesthetic value
*Flood impact mitigation, among others.
SITES shows that when assessing overall sustainability, the museum landscape is equally important to the building structure.  However, like any operational decision, the appropriate sustainable design techniques must balance with the museum's mission.  It helps to articulate what learning outcomes are involved and what the long-term plan is for the outdoor space.

==Lighting in museums==

Lighting is an essential component for museums because museums use it to illuminate objects, offices, bathrooms, entrances, storage, and nearly every other space in a museum. As important as light is for a museum, some light can cause negative effects on objects such as paintings, textiles, leather, photographs, books and paper, or mounted specimens. Light damage is cumulative and irreversible, so museums must take special care to avoid unnecessary light damage. The spectrum of light is separated into three categories: [[Ultraviolet light|ultraviolet light (UV)]], [[visible light]], and [[Infrared light|infrared light (IR)]]. Ultraviolet light is most damaging to objects, while infrared light produces heat which also causes damage. Museums generally use [[halogen]] or [[Metal-halide lamp|metal halide]] track lighting in galleries and fluorescent light in storage; however, these are not energy efficient options.&lt;ref name="Buck 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buck|first=Rebecca|title=Museum Registration Methods|year=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Halogen lights waste energy by creating four times the amount of heat as a regular incandescent light and can become fire hazards. In a world where the use of more energy-efficient products is on the rise, museums have more opportunities than ever to cut down on the amount of electricity they use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lighting Choices Inside and Outside Your Home|url=http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/lighting/bulbs.html|work=Consumer Energy Center|accessdate=15 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728221025/www.consumerenergycenter.org/lighting/bulbs.html|archivedate=28 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge to the lighting designer is to achieve a balance between creating interesting and desirable spaces, maintaining visual comfort and health of the visitor, while adhering to energy conservation goals.&lt;ref&gt;"A Lighting Study of Three Museums"_ http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/vitalsigns/workup/sf_museums/museum.html&lt;/ref&gt; Lighting is a constantly changing field, especially with new innovations in green technology and energy-efficient options. The lighting options for museums available today will radically change in the next ten years.

===Lighting options===
Beyond halogen and incandescent light options, museums use LEDs, CFLs, fiber optics, hybrid solar lighting and natural light.
*'''LEDs'''- LED stands for light emitting diodes which are illuminated by the movement of electrons in a semi-conductor material. LEDs consume one fifth of the energy of conventional bulbs (incandescent) and last one hundred times longer. While LEDs can be more expensive than incandescent, they use less energy and are more cost effective.  LEDs produce no UV light, little heat, and can be used to illuminate objects. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that rapid adoption of LED lighting over the next 20 years in the United States could save about $265 billion in energy costs.
*'''CFLs'''- Introduced in the 1980s, compact fluorescent light bulbs use gas that is stimulated with an electric current to produce light. CFLs use less energy than an incandescent and last six to ten times longer. CFLs contain mercury so disposing of them can be very complicated. Museums need to have special disposal methods when using CFLs.
*'''Fiber Optics'''- Fiber optic lights use plastic or glass fibers to distribute light. The heat source is removed from the end of the fiber and the longer the length of the fiber, the more loss of heat at the end. Glass fibers dissipate UV light, but plastic fibers need UV filtering.
*'''Hybrid Solar Lighting'''- Hybrid solar lighting combines solar power and fiber optics to channel sunlight into an enclosed space while directing infrared light into a concentrating thermo-photo-voltaic cell that converts to electricity. Sunlight is tracked by a parabolic disk and sensors maintain a constant level of illumination by supplementing sunlight with traditional electric light in special hybrid lighting fixtures. Hybrid solar lighting is more efficient than photo-voltaic cells.
*'''Natural Light'''- Numerous museums use natural light instead of artificial light to illuminate spaces.  However, sunlight can be the most damaging form of light because of the UV emitted. Natural should be considered in spaces that do not contain light sensitive materials: lobbies, offices; or in museums that do not contain light sensitive objects. Museums can also use UV filters on windows to lessen the harmful effects of sunlight.&lt;ref name="Buck 2010"/&gt; One rationale for using natural light is predicated largely on economics; a greater reliance on daylight reduces energy consumption and costs. Recent studies provide further justification that natural light generally creates a more positive effect on spaces than electric light and improves human performance. With properly installed and maintained daylighting systems, natural light has proved to be beneficial for the health, productivity, and safety of building occupants.&lt;ref&gt;L. Edwards and P. Torcellini. "A Literature Review of the Effects of Natural Light on Building Occupants," National Renewable Energy Laboratory, July 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Brise soleil]]''' is a natural lighting option that uses permanent architectural sun-shading techniques to reduce the amount of light that enters a building or a museum.
*'''Motion Sensor and Task Lighting'''- Museums can use [[motion sensor]] or [[task lighting]] in areas with less traffic or in office spaces. Lighting entire areas that are used rarely or less often than other high traffic spaces is a drain on energy and money for  a museum. These lighting options allow for light and energy to only be used when a person is engaged in a specific task or in a certain area.

==Greening the field of preventive conservation==

The needs of [[Conservation-restoration|conserving]] artifacts and landmark buildings are often seen as conflicting with the most efficient and effective means of “going green.”&lt;ref name="Katz, Jonathan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Jonathan|title=Sustainability &amp; Specimen Display: a Conflict of Program?|journal=Exhibitionist|year=2010|issue=Spring|pages=66–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light, temperature, humidity, pollutants, particulates, and pests&lt;ref name="Hatchfield, Pamela"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatchfield|first=Pamela|title=Crack Warp Shrink Flake: a New Look at Conservation Standards|journal=Museum|year=2011|issue=January–February|pages=40–3, 51–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; must all be monitored in order to properly preserve objects and historic buildings - the energy spent to control and maintain ideal environments for historic building and artifacts alone is staggering.&lt;ref name="Brophy, Sarah and Elizabeth Wylie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brophy|first=Sarah|author2=Wylie, Elizabeth|title=Saving Collections and the Planet|journal=Museum|year=2009|issue=September–October|pages=n. pag.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the heart of authenticity for many types of museums is the display of artifacts and specimens from their collections, it can be challenging to create ideal environments for these objects while also creating greener museum buildings and exhibition spaces.&lt;ref name="Katz, Jonathan" /&gt; For example, the [http://www.calacademy.org/ California Academy of Sciences], which is housed in a [http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19 LEED Platinum] building designed by [[Renzo Piano]], utilizes a natural ventilation system that could expose its collections to airborne flora and fauna, fluctuations in temperature and humidity, and strong daylight. In order to combat these factors, Jonathan Katz, CEO of Cinnabar, Inc., the firm that was hired by the California Academy of Sciences to design exhibits for the main floor of its new Natural History building, devised a “kit of parts” system where specimen display cases themselves could be configured to control temperature, humidity, and light.&lt;ref name="Katz, Jonathan" /&gt; These cases had to reflect the sustainability mission of the museum and thus had to be built in such a way that they could be reconfigured and reused as exhibits changed. This is simply one example of how the perceived conflict between green exhibition and building design and the preservation of objects was resolved.

The struggle to reconcile green practices and object conservation goes far beyond the exhibition hall, as most museums only display a fraction of the objects in their collections. Museum [[Conservator (museum)|conservators]] are tasked with the care, preservation, and restoration of these objects – the [http://www.conservation-us.org/ American Institute for Preservation], a professional organization in the United States that establishes and upholds professional standards among its members, states that the goal of its conservators is “to preserve the material evidence of our past so we can learn from it today and appreciate it in the future.”&lt;ref name="AIC Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/|work=AIC Website|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In striving to be “greener,” conservators must also now “consider not only the interaction of materials and environment with the art and artifacts [they] treat, but also the use, production, and disposal of the materials [they] employ in [their] work.”&lt;ref name="Silence, Patricia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silence|first=Patricia|title=How are US Conservators Going Green?

A typical national power grid includes a hierarchy of control centres to manage the generation, transmission, and distribution of power throughout the grid:
* one or more system control centres, responsible for scheduling of power generation to meet customer demand, and for managing major network outages and faults.
* generation control centres, responsible for managing the operation of generating plants (coal-fired, natural gas, nuclear, solar, wind, etc.), and for adjusting the power generated according to the requirements of the system control centre.
* transmission control centres, responsible for the transmission of power from generating stations to network distributors.
* distribution control centres, responsible for the distribution of power from the transmission networks to individual consumers.

Prior to the development of electronics and telecommunications networks all co-ordination between control centres was carried out by telephone. However, the development of SCADA ([[supervisory control and data acquisition]]) systems allowed remote control and monitoring of electrical plant from centralised control centres.

Initially individual SCADA manufacturers developed their own proprietary "closed" protocols for communicating from a control centre to electrical equipment in the field. These were followed by the development of "open" industry-standard protocols such as [[DNP3]] and [[IEC 61850]]. However, none of these communication protocols were suited to the requirements of communicating ''between'' control centres. To meet these special requirements for communication and co-ordination between control centres the IEC developed the [[IEC 60870]] set of standards.

'''IEC 60870 part 6''' is one of the [[IEC 60870]] set of standards which define systems used for telecontrol ([[supervisory control and data acquisition]]) in [[electrical engineering]] and [[power system automation]] applications. The [[IEC TC 57|IEC Technical Committee 57]] (Working Group 03) have developed part 6 to provide a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages between two systems which is compatible with ISO standards and ITU-T recommendations.

These standards include:
* IEC 60870-6-1 Application context and organization of standards
* IEC 60870-6-2 Use of basic standards (OSI layers 1–4)
* IEC 60870-6-501 TASE.1 Service definitions
* IEC 60870-6-502 TASE.1 Protocol definitions
* IEC 60870-6-503 TASE.2 Services and protocol
* IEC 60870-6-504 TASE.1 User conventions
* EC TR 60870-6-505 TASE.2 User guide
* IEC 60870-6-601 Functional profile for providing the connection-oriented transport service in an end system connected via permanent access to a packet switched data network
* IEC 60870-6-602 TASE transport profiles
* IEC 60870-6-701 Functional profile for providing the TASE.1 application service in end systems
* IEC 60870-6-702 Functional profile for providing the TASE.2 application service in end systems
* IEC 60870-6-802 TASE.2 Object models

==Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol==
The '''Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol''' (ICCP or IEC 60870-6/TASE.2)&lt;ref&gt;http://intelligrid.ipower.com/IntelliGrid_Architecture/New_Technologies/Tech_IEC_60870-6_%28ICCP%29.htm&lt;/ref&gt; is being specified by utility organizations throughout the world to provide data exchange over [[wide area network]]s (WANs) between utility control centers, utilities, power pools, regional control centers, and Non-Utility Generators. ICCP is also an international standard: [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) Telecontrol Application Service Element 2 (TASE.2).

===Background===
Inter-utility real time data exchange has become critical to the operation of interconnected systems in most parts of the world. For example, the development of electricity markets has seen the management of electricity networks by a functional hierarchy that is split across boundaries of commercial entities. At the top level there is typically a system operator with coordination responsibilities for dispatch and overall system security. Below this are regional transmission companies that tie together distribution companies and generating companies. In continental power systems there is now considerable interconnection across international borders. ICCP allows the exchange of real time and historical power system information including status and control data, measured values, scheduling data, energy accounting data and operator messages.

Historically there has been reliance on custom or proprietary links and [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s to exchange real time data between systems. ICCP began as an effort to develop an international standard for real-time data exchange within the electric power utility industry. A working group was formed in 1991 to develop a protocol standard, develop a prototype to test the specification, submit the specification to the IEC for standardisation and carry out interoperability testing between developing vendors. The initial driver was to meet European Common Market requirements in 1992. The official designation of the first protocol was TASE.1 (Telecontrol Application Service Element-1).&lt;ref&gt;http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec60870-6-501%7Bed1.0%7Db.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The second protocol TASE.2 &lt;ref&gt;http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec60870-6-503%7Bed3.0%7Db.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; making use of the [[Manufacturing Message Specification]] (MMS) appears to be the version that has become the most popular.

In the US, ICCP networks are widely used to tie together groups of utility companies, typically a regional system operator with transmission utilities, distribution utilities and generators. Regional operators may also be connected together to co-ordinate import and export of power between regions across major inter-ties.

===ICCP Functionality===
Basic ICCP functionality is specified as “Conformance Blocks” listed below. The
objects that are used to convey the data are defined in various parts of IEC 60870-6.

''Block Description Data Examples:''
#Periodic System Data: Status points, analogue points, quality flags, time stamp, change of value counter, protection events. Association objects to control ICCP sessions.
#Extended Data Set Condition Monitoring: Provides report by exception capability for the data types that block 1 is able to transfer periodically.
#Block Data Transfer: Provides a means transferring Block 1 and Block 2 data types as block transfers instead of point by point. In some situations this may reduce bandwidth requirements.
#Information Messages: Simple text and binary files.
#Device Control: Device control requests: on/off, trip/close, raise/lower etc. and digital setpoints. Includes mechanisms for interlocked controls and select-beforeoperate.
#Program Control: Allows an ICCP client to remote control programs executing on an ICCP server.
#Event Reporting: Extended reporting to a client of error conditions and device state changes at a server.
#Additional User Objects: Scheduling, accounting, outage and plant information.
#Time Series Data: Allows a client to request a report from a server of historical time series data between a start and end date.

===Protocol Architecture===
ICCP is based on client / server principles. Data transfers result from a request from a control centre (client) to another control centre (server). Control centres may be both clients and servers. ICCP operates at the [[OSI model#Layer 7: application layer|application layer in the OSI model]]. As such any physical interfaces, transport and network services that fit this model are supported. [[TCP/IP]] over [[Ethernet]] (802.3) seems to be the most common. ICCP may operate over a single point-to-point link between two control centres; however, the more general case is for many control centres and a routed wide area network. The logical connections or “associations” between control centres are completely general. A client may establish associations with more than one server and a client may establish more than one association with the same server. Multiple associations with same server can be established at different levels of quality of service so that high priority real time data is not delayed by lower priority or non real time data transfers.

===Access Control===
ICCP does not provide [[authentication]] or [[encryption]]. These services are normally provided by lower protocol layers.  ICCP uses “Bilateral Tables” to control access. A Bilateral Table represents the agreement between two control centres connected with an ICCP link. The agreement identifies data elements and objects that can be accessed via the link and the level of access permitted. Once an ICCP link is established, the contents of the Bilateral Tables in the server and client provide complete control over what is accessible to each party. There must be matching entries in the server and client tables to provide access to data and objects.

===Interoperability===
The wide acceptance of ICCP by the utility industry has resulted in several ICCP products being on the market. Although interoperability is not regarded as a high risk area, the standard is such that an implementation does not have to support all conformance blocks in order to claim compliance with the standard. A minimal implementation only requires Block 1. Only those blocks necessary to achieve the required functionality need be implemented. It is also not necessary to support all objects defined in the standard for any particular block. Extensive interoperability testing between products of some of the major vendors has been a feature of ICCP protocol development. Independent reports are available, as no doubt are reports from vendors. An ICCP purchaser must define functionality required in terms of conformance blocks required and the objects within those blocks. Application profiles for the ICCP client and server conformances must match if the link is to operate successfully.

===Product Differentiation===
ICCP is a real time data exchange protocol providing features for data transfer, monitoring and control. For a complete ICCP link there need to be facilities to manage and configure the link and monitor its performance. The ICCP standard does not specify any interface or requirements for these features that are necessary but nevertheless do not affect interoperability. Similarly failover and redundancy schemes and the way the [[SCADA]] responds to ICCP requests is not a protocol issue so is not specified. These non protocol specific features are referred to in the standard as “local implementation issues”. ICCP implementers are free to handle these issues any way they wish. Local implementation is the means that developers have to differentiate their product in the market with added value. Additional money spent on a product with well-developed maintenance and diagnostic tools may well be saved many times over during the life of the product if use of the ICCP connection is expected to grow and change.

===Product Configurations===
Commercial ICCP products are generally available for one of three configurations:
#As a native protocol embedded in the SCADA host.
#As a networked server.
#As a gateway processor.

As an embedded protocol the ICCP management tools and interfaces are all part of the complete suite of tools for the SCADA. This configuration offers maximum performance because of the direct access to the SCADA database without requiring any intervening buffering. This approach may not be available as an addition to a legacy system. The ICCP application may be restricted to accessing only the SCADA environment in which it is embedded.

A networked server making use of industry standard communications networking to the SCADA host may provide performance approaching that of an embedded ICCP application. On the application interface side the ICCP is not restricted to the SCADA environment but is open to other systems such as a separate data historian or other databases. Security may be easier to manage with the ICCP server segregated from the operational real time systems. The gateway processor approach is similar to the networked server except it is intended for legacy systems with minimal communications networking capability and so has the lowest performance. In the most minimal situation the ICCP gateway may communicate with the SCADA host via a serial port in a similar manner to the SCADA RTUs.

[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|300px|right|The Kuroshio Current is the west side of the clockwise North Pacific [[ocean gyre]]]]

The {{nihongo|'''Kuroshio'''|黒潮|, "くろしお"|{{IPAc-ja|ku|ro|si|o}} "Black Tide", "Japan Current"}} is a north-flowing [[ocean current]] on the west side of the North [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is similar to the [[Gulf Stream]] in the North Atlantic and is part of the North Pacific [[ocean gyre]]. Like the Gulf stream, it is a strong [[western boundary current]].

==Physical properties==
[[File:Japan's ocean currents.PNG|thumb|The ocean currents surrounding the Japanese archipelago: '''1. Kuroshio''' 2. Kuroshio extension 3. Kuroshio countercurrent 4. Tsushima Current 5. Tsugaru Current 6. Sōya Current 7. [[Oyashio Current|Oyashio]] 8. Liman Current]]

It begins off the east coast of [[Luzon]], [[Philippines]], [[Taiwan]] and flows northeastward past [[Japan]], where it merges with the easterly drift of the [[North Pacific Current]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Kuro Siwo |volume=15 |page=953}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is analogous to the [[Gulf Stream]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; transporting warm, tropical water northward toward the [[polar region]]. It is sometimes known as the ''Black Stream'' — the English translation of ''kuroshio'' and an allusion to the deep blue of its water — and also as the {{nihongo|"Japan Current"|日本海流|Nihon Kairyū}}.

The path of Kuroshio south of Japan is reported every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/KANKYO/KAIYO/qboc/index_E.html |title=Quick Bulletin of Ocean Conditions |author=Japan Coast Guard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its counterparts are the North Pacific Current to the north, the [[California Current]] to the east, and the [[North Equatorial Current]] to the south. The warm waters of the Kuroshio Current sustain the [[coral reef]]s of Japan, the northernmost coral reefs in the world. The branch into the [[Sea of Japan]] is called {{nihongo|'''Tsushima Current'''|対馬海流|Tsushima Kairyū}}.

==Biological properties==

===Distribution===
[[Western boundary current]]s transport organisms long distances rapidly and a variety of commercially important marine organisms migrate in these currents in the course of completing their lives.&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;Mann, K.H. and J.R.N. Lazier. (2006). ''Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems''. Blackwell Scientific Publications, 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean gyre|Subtropical gyres]] occupy a large fraction of the world's ocean and are more productive than originally thought. In addition, their fixation of [[carbon dioxide]] is an important factor in the global budget for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Satellite images of the Kuroshio Current illustrate how the current path [[meanders]] and forms isolated rings or [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] on the order of {{convert|100|to|300|km|mi|-1}}. Eddies retain their unique form for several months and have their own biological characteristics that depend on where they form. If the eddies are formed between the current and coastline of Japan, they may impinge on the continental shelf; their high [[kinetic energy]] has the effect of drawing large volumes of water off the shelf on one side of the ring, while adding water to the other side. The eddies size and strength decline with distance from major [[ocean currents]]. The amount of energy decreases from the rings associated with the major currents and down to eddies remote from those currents. [[Cyclonic]] eddies have the potential to cause [[upwelling]] that would affect the global primary-production budget.&lt;ref name="mann" /&gt; Upwelling brings cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface resulting in an increase in [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]. The biological consequences for young fish populations that inhabit the shelf are quite large.

==Production==
[[File:Spring Bloom Colors the Pacific Near Hokkaido.jpg|thumb|The [[Oyashio Current]] colliding with the Kuroshio Current near [[Hokkaido]]. When two currents collide, they create [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]]. [[Phytoplankton]] growing in the surface waters become concentrated along the boundaries of these eddies, tracing out the motions of the water.]]

===Impact of eddies===
The Kuroshio is a warm current—{{convert|24|C|F}} annual average sea-surface temperature—about {{convert|100|km|mi}} wide and produces frequent small to meso-scale eddies. The Kuroshio Current is ranked as a moderately high productivity ecosystem—with [[primary production]] of {{convert|150|to|300|g|oz|0}}—of carbon per square meter per year—based on [[SeaWiFS]] global primary productivity estimates. The coastal areas are highly productive and the maximum [[chlorophyll]] value is found around {{convert|100|m|ft}} depth.&lt;ref name="Terazaki"&gt;Terazaki, Makoto (1989) "Recent Large-Scale Changes in the Biomass of the Kuroshio Current Ecosystem" in Kenneth Sherman and Lewis M. Alexander (eds.), Biomass Yields and Geography of Large Marine Ecosystems (Boulder: Westview) AAAS Selected Symposium 111, pp.37-65. {{ISBN|0-8133-7844-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are indications that eddies contribute to the preservation and survival of fish larvae transported by the Kuroshio.&lt;ref name="belkin"&gt;Belkin, I., [http://www.lme.noaa.gov/LMEWeb/LME_Report/lme_49.pdf  "Kuroshio Current: LME #49"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plankton]] biomass fluctuates yearly and is typically highest in the eddy area of the Kuroshio’s edge. Warm-core rings are not known for having high productivity. However, the biology of the warm-core rings from the Kuroshio Current show results of productivity equally distributed throughout for a couple of reasons. One is upwelling at the periphery; the other is the [[convection|convective mixing]] caused by the cooling of surface water as the ring moves north of the current. The [[thermostad]] is the deep [[mixed layer]] that has discrete boundaries and uniform temperature. Within this layer, nutrient-rich water is brought to the surface, which generates a burst of primary production. Given that the water in the core of a ring has a different temperature regime than the shelf waters, there are times when a warm-core ring is undergoing its [[spring bloom]] while the surrounding shelf waters are not.&lt;ref name="mann" /&gt;

There are many complex interactions with the [[warm core ring|warm-core ring]] and thus lifetime productivity is not very different from the surrounding shelf water. A study in 1998&lt;ref name="mann" /&gt; found that the primary productivity within a warm-core ring was almost the same as in the cold jet outside it, with evidence of upwelling of nutrients within the ring. In addition, there was discovery of dense populations of [[phytoplankton]] at the nutricline in a ring, presumably supported by upward mixing of nutrients.&lt;ref name="mann" /&gt; Furthermore, there have been [[Acoustics|acoustic]] studies in the warm-core ring, which showed intense sound scattering from [[zooplankton]] and fish populations in the ring and very sparse acoustic signals outside of it.

[[Copepods]] have been used as indicator-species of water masses. It has been suggested that copepods have been transported from the Kuroshio Current into southwest Taiwan through the [[Luzon Strait]].&lt;ref name="hwang"&gt;Hwang, J. (2007). "Instrusions of the Kuroshio Current in the northern South China Sea affect copepod assemblages of the Luzon Strait." ''Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology'' 352&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuroshio intrusion through the Luzon Strait and further into the [[South China Sea]] may explain why copepods show a very high diversity in adjacent waters of the intrusion areas. The Kuroshio Current intrusion has a major influence on ''C. sinicus'' and ''E. concinna'', which are two copepod species with higher index values for winter and originate from the East China Sea. During the southwestern [[monsoon]], the South China Sea Surface Current moves northward during the summer toward the Kuroshio Current. As a result of this water circulation, the zooplankton communities in the boundary waters are unique and diverse.&lt;ref name="hwang" /&gt;

===Fish===
The biomass of fish stocks depends on the biomass of lower [[trophic level]]s, primary production and on oceanic and atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref name="belkin" /&gt; In the Kuroshio-Oyashio region, the fish catches depend on oceanographic conditions, such as the Oyashio’s southward intrusion and the Kuroshio’s large [[meander]] south of Honshu. The [[Oyashio Current]] contains [[subarctic]] water that is much colder and fresher than the resident water east of Honshu. Thus, the fish intrusion affects recruitment, biomass, and catch of species such as [[pollock]], [[sardine]], and [[anchovy]]. When the Oyashio is well developed and protrudes southward, the cold waters are favorable for sardine production. The Kuroshio large meander development correlates with sardine recruitment and catch due to the proximity of the Kuroshio meander to the southern spawning grounds of sardine.&lt;ref name="belkin" /&gt;

===Squid===
The [[Japanese Flying Squid]] ''(Todarodes pacificus)'' has three stocks that breed in winter, summer, and autumn. The winter spawning group is associated with the Kuroshio Current. After spawning in January to April in the [[East China Sea]], the larvae and juveniles travel north with the Kuroshio Current. They are turned inshore and are caught between the islands of [[Honshu]] and [[Hokkaido]] during the summer. The summer spawning is in another part of the East China Sea, from which the larvae are entrained into the [[Tsushima Strait|Tsushima current]] that flows north between the islands of Japan and the mainland.  Afterward, the current meets a southward flowing cold coastal current, the [[Liman Current]], and the summer-spawned squid are fished along the boundary between the two.&lt;ref name="mann" /&gt; This illustrates the use of these [[western boundary currents]] as a rapid transport that enable the eggs and larvae to develop during winter in warm water, while the adults travel with minimum energy expenditure to exploit the rich northern feeding grounds.&lt;ref name="mann" /&gt; Studies have reported that annual catches in Japan have gradually increased since the late 1980s and it has been proposed that changing environmental conditions have caused the autumn and winter spawning areas in the Tsushima Strait and near the [[Goto Islands]] to overlap.&lt;ref name="sakurai"&gt;Sakurai, H., (2007). "An overview of the Oyashio ecosystem." ''Deep-Sea Research Part II'' 54&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, winter spawning sites over the [[continental shelf]] and slope in the East China Sea are expanding.&lt;ref name="mann" /&gt;

Although historically the [[United States|U.S.]] [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Connecticut]] is not typically known to fall casualty to [[tornado]]es, more than 100 of these powerful storms have affected the state in modern history, resulting in at least 48&amp;nbsp;deaths, 780&amp;nbsp;injuries, and more than $500&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name="NCDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~storms |title=NCDC Storm Events |accessdate=2008-05-13 |year=2008 |publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503053157/http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~storms |archivedate=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731080214/http://www.courant.com/news/weather/hc-weacol0503.artmay03,0,1068269.story Tornado Safety Rules Worth Reviewing] [[Hartford Courant]] Online. Accessed 2008-05-13.&lt;/ref&gt; This list of tornadoes in the state is likely incomplete, as official records date back only to 1950 for tornadoes in the United States.&lt;ref name="NCDC"/&gt;

As with most of the [[northeastern United States]], the number of tornadoes peaks in the summer months, normally in July or August. [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]] has had the most tornadoes in the state, although since 1950 [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]] has reported the most tornadoes. Several areas have been struck more than once, and [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] has been struck by no less than four tornadoes since 1955.

From 1953 to 1991, Connecticut recorded an average of about 1.3&amp;nbsp;tornadoes per year, ranked 43rd in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Although Connecticut tornadoes are typically weak, isolated events can be violent. Three tornadoes of [[Fujita scale|F4 intensity]] have affected the state in its history, as well as at least 27 tornadoes of F2 intensity or greater. Outbreaks of three or more tornadoes in a single day occurred in 1786, 1787, 1878, 1973, 1989, 1998, 2001 and 2018. The year 1973&amp;nbsp;was particularly active; eight tornadoes occurred on six separate days. The year 2018 has the highest number of tornadoes recorded in the state in a year, with nine total. The [[1878 Wallingford tornado]] killed at least 29 and likely 34 people in [[Wallingford, Connecticut|Wallingford]], the most by any tornado event in [[History of Connecticut|Connecticut history]].

==Before 1831==
*June 14, 1648: A "great tempest" downed trees somewhere in present-day [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]].&lt;ref name="Ludlam list"&gt;Ludlam, pg. 201&lt;/ref&gt;
*June 20, 1682: A violent storm, including one or more likely tornadoes, devastated forests in southern Connecticut, affecting areas north of [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]] across the [[Housatonic River]] before passing out into [[Long Island Sound]] between [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. The damage was worst around present-day [[Shelton, Connecticut|Shelton]], where a path was cut a half-mile wide where there was "scarce a tree left standing".&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, p. 552&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludlam, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;
*1728 or 1729: A possible tornado passed through [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] and/or [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]].&lt;ref name="Ludlam list"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT08131878"&gt;{{cite news | title = The hurricanes of the past | work = [[The New York Times]] | page = 2 | date = 1878-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 17, 1784: Two tornadoes struck central Connecticut. The first tornado touched down near present-day [[Roxbury, Connecticut|Roxbury]], then known as "Shipague-Neck". It travelled through the village of [[South Britain, Connecticut|South Britain]], injuring five people, with one man injured so that "his life was in great danger". Ten houses, five barns, and three mills were badly damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Untitled article | url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=1&amp;did=835585652&amp;SrchMode=2&amp;sid=6&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1235205772&amp;clientId=61720| publisher = Hartford Courant| page = 3| date = 1784-08-31|accessdate=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second tornado injured one person while moving down a hillside west of [[Southington, Connecticut|Southington]].&lt;ref name="Grazulis 553"&gt;Grazulis, p. 553&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 23, 1786: As many as six tornadoes did a great deal of damage in [[Windham County, Connecticut|Windham County]]. Twenty homes and sixty-three barns were destroyed, as well as {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of dense forest. One woman was killed and five people were injured in [[Woodstock, Connecticut|Woodstock]]. Leaves from destroyed trees rained down heavily in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name="Grazulis 553"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludlam, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Another source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=1w-CLumC_3IC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=Connecticut+tornado&amp;source=web&amp;ots=XFe1JKzjRE&amp;sig=Nyj2bEhOQMm5iePhMII6sNp0tdQ#PPA121,M1 Historic Storms of New England, Page 121]--&gt;
*August 15, 1787: The [[Four-State Tornado Swarm]] of 1787 was the largest tornado outbreak recorded to date, and affected most of [[New England]]. The first in the state touched down around 1:30&amp;nbsp;PM near New Britain, traveling along nearly the same path as a tornado in 1728 or 1729. This tornado was nearly as violent as the [[Wallingford Tornado of 1878]]. A mother and two of her children were killed in [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]], and 10 others were injured before the tornado lifted outside of the town.&lt;ref name="tornado project"&gt;[[Tornado Project]].

Another tornado struck [[East Windsor, Connecticut|East Windsor]], damaging several homes and barns. Yet another touched down near [[Killingly, Connecticut|Killingly]], moving northeast into [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="NYT08131878"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grazulis 553"/&gt;
*June 19, 1794: A tornado destroyed several structures in Milford injuring four people, while a separate tornado cut through [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]]. A strange incident was recorded where a tree was uprooted and carried, fully upright, along a road in [[New Milford, Connecticut|New Milford]], along with several other large objects. A barn door was found {{convert|10|mi|km}} from its source. Some loss of life likely occurred from one or both tornadoes.&lt;ref name="Grazulis 553"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cerveny, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 8, 1797: A tornado touched down in [[North Salem, New York]], moving into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]]. Six people were injured in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]], and possible tornado damage continued as far as Long Island Sound in Branford.&lt;ref name="Grazulis 553"/&gt;
*August 2, 1799: A tornado destroyed two houses in [[New London County, Connecticut|New London County]], affecting the towns of [[Franklin, Connecticut|Franklin]], [[Lebanon, Connecticut|Lebanon]], and [[Bozrah, Connecticut|Bozrah]].&lt;ref name="Grazulis 554"&gt;Grazulis, p. 554&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of plants that have a [[Cooking|culinary]] role as [[vegetable]]s. "Vegetable" can be used in several senses, including culinary, [[botanical]] and legal. This list includes botanical [[fruit]]s such as pumpkins, and does not include [[herb]]s, [[spice]]s, [[cereal]]s and most [[List of fruits|culinary fruits]] and [[Nut (fruit)|culinary nuts]]. [[Edible mushroom|Edible fungi]] are not included in this list.

Legal vegetables are defined for regulatory, tax and other purposes. An example would include the [[tomato]], which is a botanical [[berry (botany)|berry]], but a culinary vegetable according to the [[United States]].

'''''Milicia excelsa'''''  is a [[tree]] species from the genus ''[[Milicia (plant)|Milicia]]'' of the family ''[[Moraceae]]''. It is one of two species (the other being ''[[Milicia regia]]'') yielding timber commonly known as '''African teak''', '''iroko''', '''intule''', '''kambala''', '''moreira''', '''mvule''', '''odum''' and '''tule'''.

==Distribution and habitat==
African teak is distributed across tropical central Africa. Its range extends from Guinea-Bissau in the west to Mozambique in the east. It is found in [[Angola]], [[Benin]], [[Burundi]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Gabon]], [[Ghana]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Togo]], [[Uganda]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Its natural habitat is in wet savannah, rainforest, riverine and low-altitude evergreen forests. It can tolerate an annual rainfall of less than {{convert|70|cm}} or six months of drought as long as there is a stream or a ground water source nearby.&lt;ref name=TRADA/&gt;

In a study done on population distribution of ''Milicia excelsa'' in 2009,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; researchers found that most of the populations that were being studied were inbred. After some analysis the researchers found that the ''Milicia excelsa'' was inbreeding due to lack of proximity to other ''Milicia excelsa'' individuals. Inbreeding could contribute to why this species is moving closer to being on the “Threatened” conservation list. If the numbers of mates available are not high enough because dispersion methods are not effective over long distances, then the species will begin to suffer from [[inbreeding depression]] (inbreeding can lead to accumulation of recessive deleterious alleles in a population).

[[File:Milicia Excelsa_(Chlorophora Excelsa)_(Bangla_-_আফ্রিকান_টিকওক).jpg|thumb|Trunk of Milicia excelsa (Chlorophora Excelsa) in [[Lawachara National Park]], Bangladesh. 2016.]]

==Description==
The species is a large deciduous tree growing up to {{convert|50|m}} high. The trunk is bare lower down with the first branch usually at least {{convert|20|m}} above the ground. It often has several short buttress roots at the base. The bark is pale or dark grey, thick but little fissured, and if it gets damaged it oozes milky [[latex]]. There are a few thick branches in the crown all fairly horizontal giving an umbrella shape. The smaller branches hang down in female trees and curve up in male trees. The leaves are {{convert|5|to|10|cm}} long, ovate or elliptical with a finely toothed edge, green and smooth above and slightly downy beneath. Older leaves turn yellow, and all of the leaves have a prominent rectangular mesh of veins visible on the underside. The trees are [[dioecious]]. Male trees have white [[catkin]]s that extend {{convert|15|to|20|cm}} and dangle from twigs at the axils of the leaves. Female trees have flower spikes measuring {{convert|5|to|6|cm}} long by {{convert|2|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide, green with prominent styles. The fruit are long, wrinkled and fleshy with the small seeds embedded in the pulp.&lt;ref name=TRADA/&gt;

There is evidence that some of the variation that is described above amongst individuals is due to the variation in the environment. In a study done in 2010, it was found that environmental change from different regions in Benin caused much of the variation in ''Milicia excelsa''. Many studies have attributed this variation in growth to the differences in climate of regions. Specifically, soil characteristics and rainfall played a major role in the morphological variation of trunk growth of ''Milicia excelsa''.

''Milicia excelsa'' is one of two tree species (the other being ''[[Milicia regia]]'') that yield timber commonly known as '''African teak'''.

==Ecology==
Flowering takes place at a range of different times, but often occurs in January and February soon after the time when most of the leaves fall or shortly before the new leaves appear. The fruits take about a month to ripen and are eaten by squirrels, bats, and birds, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings.&lt;ref name=TRADA/&gt; Some populations, especially plantations, are attacked by a gall mite.

A study in Ghana found that this tree relies heavily on the [[straw-coloured fruit bat]] (''Eidolon helvum'') for [[seed dispersal]], over 98% of the seed falling to the ground having passed through its gut.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, Daniel; Kankam, Bright; Wagner, Michael [http://nau.edu/CEFNS/Forestry/Research/Ghana/Seed-Dispersal/ The role of the fruit bat, ''Eidolon helvum'', in seed dispersal, survival, and germination in ''Milicia excelsa'', a threatened West African hardwood.] Northern Arizona University School of Forestry.&lt;/ref&gt; This seed also germinated better than uneaten seed and resisted predation longer.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;

==Evolution==
In a study &lt;ref&gt;1. Dainou, K., E. Laurenty, G. Mahy, O. J. Hardy, Y. Brostaux, N. Tagg, and J.-L. Doucet. "Phenological Patterns in a Natural Population of a Tropical Timber Tree Species, Milicia Excelsa (Moraceae): Evidence of Isolation by Time and Its Interaction with Feeding Strategies of Dispersers." ''American Journal of Botany'' (2012): 1453-463. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; it was seen that isolation was caused by one or more of the animals that are known for dispersal of ''Milicia excelsa'' (i.e. Bats, rodents, and birds). It is hypothesized that the ancestor slowly developed a different flowering time from its ancestor, which led to differences in selection pressure during the time of reproduction. This, over time, has resulted in the tree that we see today commonly known as Iroko. Although this is the theory that has the most evidence, it is possible for ''Milicia excelsa'' to have evolved in a different way.

==Uses==
The tree yields a strong, dense and durable dark brown hardwood timber. It is resistant to termites and is used for construction, furniture, joinery, panelling, floors and boats.&lt;ref name="The Wood Database"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wood-database.com/iroko/|title=''Iroko - The Wood Database''|accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree can be used in the control of erosion, and for providing shade as a roadside tree in urban areas. It grows rapidly, can be [[Coppicing|coppiced]] and is ready for cutting after about fifty years. The tree is nitrogen fixing and the leaves are used for mulching.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5327e/x5327e1b.htm |title=''Milicia excelsa'' |author= |date= |work= Indigenous multipurpose trees of Tanzania: uses and economic benefits |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organisation: Forestry Department |accessdate=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree is also used in herbal medicine. The powdered bark is used for coughs, heart problems and lassitude. The latex is used as an anti-tumour agent and to clear stomach and throat obstructions. The leaves and the ashes also have medicinal uses.&lt;ref name=FAO/&gt;

==Importance to the environment==
In a study done on the mineralization of ''Milicia excelsa'',&lt;ref&gt;Braissant, Olivier, Guillaume Cailleau, Michel Aragno, and Eric P. Verrecchia. "Biologically Induced Mineralization in the Tree Milicia Excelsa (Moraceae): Its Causes and Consequences to the Environment." ''Geobiology'': 59-66. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; it was observed that in certain conditions Milicia acts as a carbon sink. These specific conditions are characterized by presence of oxalate, bacteria for oxalate oxidation and a dry season, which are common conditions in which Milicia tends to grow. This is important because the conversion of atmospheric carbon into land carbon decreases the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Because of its importance to the environment there has been research done on how to conserve Iroko. A solution that has been proposed to help ''Milicia excelsa'' move further away from being threatened is [[agroforestry]].  It was found that agroforestry helps increase habitat for plants and animals. More importantly, agroforestry promotes the growth of any plant species by taking pressure off remnant forests that usually have to repopulate threatened species on their own.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The people that conducted this study found that it would be a good method to use to specifically fight against the slow decline of the Iroko species.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; However, most of the people that were surveyed for the study did not use this system specifically to regenerate this species, therefore even though there is hope in helping this species the measures have not been taken to do so.

When forests are felled, isolated trees are often left standing and the tree regenerates easily. Fresh seed germinates readily but it loses viability in storage.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

Because of these and many other uses of ''Milicia excelsa'' people have over harvested this species to the point of concern. The IUCN has this species on the Red List under ‘Near Threatened’ (BIZOUX, J.-P., 2009).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;J.-P. Bizoux,  K. Dai’nou,

==Mythology==
In West Africa, African teak is considered to be a sacred tree. It is often protected when the surrounding bush is cleared, ritual sacrifices take place underneath it and gifts are given to it. Fertility and birth are associated with it and its timber is used to make ceremonial drums and coffins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t9450e/t9450e06.htm |title=3.3 The symbolic and sacred significance of particular forest resources |work=The cultural and symbolic importance of forest resources |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organisation: Forestry Department |accessdate=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''philosophy''', '''moral conversion''' is an [[Existential humanism|existential]] [[Existential crisis|change]] in the person, who is perceived as the moral agent adopting new moral standards (or [[mores]]) in a process of internal transformation. Moral conversion is a relatively rare event in a person's normal development. It involves a decision that is both conscious and existentialist (i.e. based on critical questioning).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=194}} Moral conversion is based on the [[internalist]] view of [[morality]].{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=7}}

==As an existential event==
The process of moral conversion was described by [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] of the [[University of Chicago]], who developed the so-called [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]. Six classes of moral conversion were identified, based on progressively higher and higher levels of moral reasoning, beginning with the ''preconventional'' level of a child, and concluding with the ''postconventional'' (or autonomous) level of an adult aware of ethical principles guiding universally moral behaviour.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=203}}

Notably, the notion of moral conversion has been distinguished from the theory of moral development ''per se'', by [[Walter E. Conn]] (of [[Villanova University]]) and [[John C. Gibbs]] (of the [[Ohio State University]]).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=205}} Moral conversion, according to Conn and Gibbs, involves critical questioning and therefore differs from any spontaneous moral development (Kohlberg). It results in the setting forth of the "self-chosen values" (Conn), which bring the existential dimension to the transforming process.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=219&amp;ndash;224}}

[[Alfredo J. Mac Laughlin]] of St. Ambrose University defines moral conversion by the frequent occurrence of the "{{nobreak|sharp-turn}} conversions" resulting from the presence of [[free will]], which differ from the natural/spontaneous development taking place in incremental stages (Kohlberg).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=234}} The most significant aspect of moral conversion is the withdrawal from the moral convictions of the past, which is based on "critical self-appropriation" or the ''critical'' discovery of oneself.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=250}} It depends on the sense of authenticity beyond the possibility of predictions.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=253}}

==As self-transcendence==
[[Bernard Lonergan]] explains that moral conversion is not moral perfection. It is the "withdrawal from self-enclosure" or the shift from personal satisfaction criterion to values that transcend oneself (or one's own group interests). Moral conversion, according to Lonergan, is one of three different types of conversion along with the ''intellectual'' and the [[Religious conversion|''religious'' conversion]].{{sfn|Conn|1982}} From a causal point of view, it is the difference between varying levels of consciousness leading to a higher sense of responsibility for the world.{{sfn|Doran|2011|p=13&amp;ndash;18}}

The abode of snakes is believed to be ''[[Patala|patala loka]]'', (the seven realms of the universe located below the earth) and lowest of them is also called Naga-loka, the region of the [[Nāga|Nagas]], as part of the creation force and their blessings are sought for the welfare of the family.{{sfn|Verma|2000|pp=37-38}}&lt;ref name=Nag/&gt; Serpent deity made of silver, stone or wood or the painting of snakes on the wall are given a bath with milk and then revered.

According to Hindu [[Purana|puranic]] literature, [[Kashyapa]], son of Lord [[Brahma]], the creator created [[Kadroo]] who belonged to the Naga race of the [[Pitru Loka]] and she gave birth to the Nagas; among the other three, the first wife gave birth to [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s, the second to [[Garuda]] and the fourth to [[Daityas]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' epic story, [[Astika (Hinduism)|Astika]], the Brahmin son of [[Jaratkaru]]s, who stopped the [[Sarpa Satra]] of [[Janamejaya II|Janamejaya]], ruler of the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru empire]] which lasted for 12 years is well documented. This [[yagna]] was performed by Janamejaya to decimate the race of all snakes, to avenge for the death of his father [[Parikshita]] due to snake bite of [[Takshaka]], the king of snakes. The day that the yagna (fire sacrifice) was stopped, due to the intervention of the Astika, was on the [[Shukla Paksha]] [[Panchami]] day in the month of Shravana when [[Takshaka]], the king of snakes and his remaining race at that time were saved from decimation by the Sarpa Satra yagna. Since that day, the festival is observed as Naga Panchami.{{sfn|Garg|1992|p=743}}

==Etymology==
[[Panchami]] is the fifth day among the fifteen days of the moon's waxing and/or waning. This special day of the serpent worship always falls on the fifth day of the moon's waning in the Lunar Hindu month of [[Shravana]] July/August.  Hence this is called Naga Panchami (Naga-Cobra; or simply, 'serpent)..

==Legends==
There are many legends in [[Hindu mythology]] and [[folklore]] narrated to the importance of worship of snakes.{{sfn|Verma|2000|pp=37-38}} Such as in the Mahabharta.

==History==
Indian scriptures such as [[Agni Purana]], [[Skanda Purana]], [[Narada Purana]] and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' give details of history of snakes extolling worship of snakes.{{sfn|Verma|2000|pp=37-38}}
[[File:Snakesacrifice.jpg|right|thumb|Sarpa Satra, the snake sacrifice where [[Astika]], young Brahmin stops the [[yagna]].]]
In the ''Mahabharata'' epic, Janamejeya, the son of King [[Parikshita]] of Kuru dynasty was performing a snake sacrifice known as Sarpa Satra, to avenge for the death of his father from a snake bite by the snake king called Taksaka. A sacrificial fireplace had been specially erected and the fire sacrifice to kill all snakes in the world was started by a galaxy of learned Brahmin sages. The sacrifice performed in the presence of Janamejaya was so powerful that it was causing all snakes to fall into the ''Yagna kunda'' (sacrificial fire pit). When the priests found that only Takshaka who had bitten and killed Parisksihita had escaped to the nether world of [[Indra]] seeking his protection, the sages increased the tempo of reciting the [[mantra]]s (spells) to drag Takshaka and also Indra to the sacrificial fire. Takshaka had coiled himself around Indra’s cot but the force of the sacrificial yagna was so powerful that even Indra along with Takshaka were dragged towards the fire. This scared the gods who then appealed to [[Manasa]]devi to intervene and resolve the crisis. She then requested her son Astika to go to the site of the yagna and appeal to Janamejaya to stop the Sarpa Satra yagna. Astika impressed Janamejaya with his knowledge of all the [[Sastras]] (scriptures) who granted him to seek a boon. It was then that Astika requested Janamejeya to stop the Sarpa Satra. Since the king was never known to refuse a boon given to a Brahmin, he relented, in spite of protects by the rishis performing the yagna. The yagna was then stopped and thus the life of Indra and Takshaka and his other serpent race were spared. This day, according to the Hindu Calendar, happened to be ''Nadivardhini Panchami'' (fifth day of bright fortnight of the lunar month of Shravana during the [[monsoon season]]) and since then the day is a festival day of the Nagas as their life was spared on this day. Indra also went to Manasadevi and worshipped her.{{sfn|Garg|1992|p=743}}

According to [[Garuda Purana]] offering prayers to snake on this day is auspicious and will usher good tidings in one’s life. This is to be followed by feeding Brahmins.{{sfn|Alter|1992|pp=137-138}}

==Worship==
On the [http://journeymart.com/holidays-ideas/festivals/nag-panchami.aspx Nag Panchami] day Naga, cobras, and snakes are worshipped with milk, sweets, flowers, lamps and even sacrifices. Images of Naga deities made of silver, stone, wood, or paintings on the wall are first bathed with water and milk and then worshipped with the reciting of the following mantras.{{sfn|Verma|2000|pp=37-38}}

Fast is observed on this day and [[Brahmin]]s are fed. The piety observed on this day is considered a sure protection against the fear of snake bite. At many places, real snakes are worshipped and fairs held. On this day digging the earth is taboo as it could kill or harm snakes which reside in the earth.{{sfn|Verma|2000|pp=37-38}}
[[File:Naga182.JPG|right|thumb|Nagas in Naga Loka]]
[[File:Nag at Nag pokhari.jpg|thumb|Nag at Nag pokhari, Naksaal, Kathmandu]]
In some regions of the country milk is offered along with crystallized sugar, [[rice pudding]]. A special feature is of offering a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] flower which is placed in a silver bowl. In front of this bowl, a [[rangoli]] (coloured design pattern) of snake is created on the floor with a brush made of wood or clay or silver or gold with [[sandalwood]] or [[turmeric]] paste as the paint. The design pattern will resemble a five hooded snake. Devotees then offer worship to this image on the floor. In villages, the [[anthill]]s where the snakes are thought to reside, are searched. Incense is offered to the anthill as prayer along with milk (a myth of folk lore to feed milk to the snakes) to ensnare snakes to come out of the anthill. After this, milk is poured into the hole in the anthill as a libation to the snake god.{{sfn|Alter|1992|pp=137-138}}

On this occasion doorways and walls outside the house are painted with pictures of snakes, auspicious mantras (spells) are also written on them. It is believed that such depictions will ward off poisonous snakes.{{sfn|Alter|1992|pp=137-138}}

Naga Panchami is also the occasion observed as ''[[Bhratru Panchami]]'' when women with brothers worship snakes and its holes, and offer prayers to propitiate ''nagas'' so that their brothers are protected and do not suffer or die due to snake bite.{{sfn|Verma|2000|pp=37-38}}

Naga Panchami is also celebrated as ''Vishari Puja'' or ''Bishari Puja'' in some parts of the country and '''Bisha''' or '''Visha''' means "poison".{{sfn|Sharma|2008|pp=68-70}}

==Folktales==
Apart 
from 
the 
scriptural 
mention 
about 
snakes 
and 
the 
festival, 
there 
are
also
many 
folk 
tales. 
One 
such 
tale 
is 
of 
a 
farmer 
living 
in 
a 
village. 
He
had 
two 
sons 
and 
one 
of 
whom 
killed 
three
snakes 
during 
[[ploughing]] 
operations. 
The
mother
of 
the 
snake 
took 
revenge 
on 
the 
same 
night 
by 
biting 
the 
farmer, 
his 
wife 
and 
two 
children 
and 
they
all 
died. 
Next
day 
the 
farmer’s 
only 
surviving 
daughter, 
distraught 
and 
grieved 
by 
the death of her parents and brothers, pleaded before the mother snake with an offering of a bowl of milk and requested for forgiveness and to restore the life of her parents and brothers. Pleased with this offering the snake pardoned them and restored the farmer and his family to life.{{sfn|Alter|1992|p=138}}

In folklore, snakes also refer to the rainy season - the ''[[Ritu (Indian season)|varsha ritu]]'' in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]. They are also depicted as deities of ponds and rivers and are said to be the embodiment of water as they spring out of their holes, like a spring of water.{{sfn|Alter|1992|p=143}}

==Worship in various regions in the country==
[[File:Naag or serpent.jpg|thumb|Naag or serpent]]
As it is believed that snakes have more powers than humans and on account of its association with [[Shiva]], [[Mariamman|Devi]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Murugan|Subramanya]], a degree of fear is instilled resulting in deification of the cobra and its worship throughout the country by Hindus.{{sfn|Sharma|2008|pp=68-70}}

Snake has connotation with the [[Moon]]’s nodes known in [[Hindu astrology]]. The head of the snake is represented by [[Rahu]] ("Dragon's head") and its tail by [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]] ("Dragon's tail"). If in the [[zodiac]]al chart of an individual all the seven major planets are hemmed between Rahu and Ketu in the reverse order (anticlockwise) it is said to denote [[Kalasarpa dosha]] (Defect due to black snakes), which forebodes ill luck and hardship in an individual's life and therefore appeased by offering worship to the snakes on Naga Panchami day.&lt;ref name=Nag/&gt;

===Central India===
In Central India, in [[Nagpur]], [[Maharashtra State]] snakes have special identity. The name of the city is derived from the word Naga which means snake as the place was infested with snakes. Nagpur was the homeland of 'Naga' people who embraced Buddhism, supported it with great efforts in its early period, and propagated it throughout India. [[Nagoba Temple]] in Mahal is where worship is offered on Naga Panchami day; the temple was found under the [[neem tree]] known as “Nagoba ka vota", under a platform. Another important event held on this occasion is an arduous trekking pilgrimage known as [[Nagdwar Yatra]] to [[Pachmarhi]]. On this occasion food prepared as offering to the snake god is cooked in a ''kadai''.&lt;ref name=Nag/&gt;

===North and Northwestern India===
Nag Panchami is celebrated all over [[North India]]. In [[Kashmir]], from historical times snakes have been worshipped by Hindus, and the places of worship are reported as 700.{{sfn|Balfour|1885|p=577}}

In north western India, in cities such as [[Benares]], it is the time when ''[[Akhara]]s'' (venues of wrestling practice and competitions) as part of Naga Panchami celebrations are bedecked; on this occasion the ahkaras are cleaned up thoroughly and walls painted with images of snakes, priests preside, and the [[gurus]] are honoured along with the sponsors. Its significance is that the [[wrestler]]s stand for virility and Naga symbolizes this “scheme of virility”.{{sfn|Alter|1992|p=136}} Akharas are decorated with snake images showing snakes drinking milk.{{sfn|Alter|1992|p=138}}

In [[Narasinghgarh]] ''akhara'' in [[Varanasi]] there is special shrine dedicated to Naga Raja (King of Snakes) where a bowl is suspended above the image of the snake and milk is poured into it so that it trickle over the snake god as a form of an offering.{{sfn|Alter|1992|pp=139-140}}

On this day [[snake charmer]]s are everywhere in towns and villages displaying snakes in their baskets which will have all types of snakes such as [[pythons]], [[rat snakes]], and cobras mingled together. Some of the snake charmers hang limp snakes around their neck and crowds gather to witness these scenes. The snakes in the basket are also worshipped on the occasion.{{sfn|Alter|1992|p=137}}

However, in [[Punjab]] this festival is celebrated in a different month and in a different format, in the month of [[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]] (September–October) and is called ''Guga Nauvami'' (ninth day of lunar month during bright half of Moon). On this occasion an image of snake is made with [[dough]] and kept in a “winnowing basket” and taken round the village.  Villagers offer [[flour]] and [[butter]] as oblation to the image. At the end of the parade, the snake is formally buried and women worship the snake for nine days and give offering of [[curds]].{{sfn|Sharma|2008|pp=68-70}}

===Western India===
[[File:Bhujang Naga Temple, Bhujia Hill, Bhuj, Kutch Gujarat.jpg|thumb|Bhujang Naga Temple at Bhujia Hill, Bhuj, Kutch, Gujarat]]
[[File:Bhujang Nag Temple, Bhujia Fort Hill, Bhuj, Kutch, Gujarat.jpg|thumb|Deity of Bhujang Nag Temple]]
As in the rest of the country, the Naga Panchmi is celebrated in [[Western India]] and is known as the ''Ketarpal'' or ''Kshetrapal'', meaning, a protector of his domain.{{sfn|Dilipsinh|2004|p=38}}

In this part of the country, snake is named ''Bhujang'', which is also the Sanskrit name for snake, in the [[Kutch]] region. The name is attributed to the city of [[Bhuj]] which is located below the hill named [[Bhujiya]], after Bhujang, as it was the abode of snakes. On top of this hill there is a fort known as the [[Bhujia Fort]] where a temple has been built for the snake god and a second temple is at the foot of the hill known as Nani Devi.{{sfn|Dilipsinh|2004|p=38}} Bhujia Fort was the scene of a major battle between [[Deshalji I]], the ruler of Kutch and [[Sher Buland Khan]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Viceroy of [[Gujarat]] who had invaded Kutch. It was the early period of Deshalji's reign. When the army of Kutch was in a state of losing the battle, a group of [[Naga sadhu|Naga Bawa]]s opened the gate of Bhujia Fort by a clever ploy of visiting Nag temple for worship and joined the fray against Sher Buland Khan's army. Eventually Deshalji I won the battle. Since that day Naga Bawa and their leader have a pride of place in the procession held on Nag Panchami day.{{sfn|Dilipsinh|2004|p=38}} Within the fort, at one corner, there is a small square tower dedicated to ''Bhujang Nag'' (snake god), who in folklore is said to have been the brother of [[Shesha|Sheshnag]]. It is said Bhujang Nag came from [[Thangadh|Than]] of [[Kathiawar]] and freed Kutch from the oppression of demons known as [[daitya]]s and [[rakshasa]]s.{{sfn|Dilipsinh|2004|p=38}} The Snake Temple was also built at the time of the fortification of the hill during Deshalji I's reign and provided with a [[chhatri]]. Every year on Nag Panchami day a fair is held at the temple premises. In the [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] community Nag Panchami is celebrated in honour of [[Sindhi festivals|Gogro]].

===Eastern and Northeastern India===
In eastern and north eastern states of India such as [[West Bengal]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and [[Assam]], the goddess is worshipped as [[Manasa]]. In Hindu mythology, Manasa is a snake goddess who was also called Jaratkaru and wife of Brahmin sage also named Jaratkaru. On this occasion, a twig of manasa plant ''([[euphorbia lingularum]])'' symbolizing the goddess Manasa is fixed on the ground and worshipped, not only in the month of Shravan, as in the rest of the country, but also in the month [[Bhadra Masa]]. Festival is held within the precincts of the house.{{sfn|Sharma|2008|pp=68-70}}

===South India===
[[File:Vijayanagar snakestone.jpg|right|thumb|Stone statues of snakes worshipped in South India]]
In [[South India]], snake is identified with Subramanya (Commander of the celestial army) and also with Shiva and Vishnu.{{sfn|Sharma|2008|pp=68-70}}

In [[Karnataka]], the preparation for the festival starts on the [[New Moon day]] of [[Bhimana Amavasya]], five days prior to the festival day of ''Panchami''. Girls offer prayers to the images made out of white clay painted with white dots. They take a vow by tying a thread dipped in turmeric paste on their right wrist and offer prayers. An image of snake is drawn on the floor in front of the house and milk is offered as oblation. On the night previous to the festival they keep complete fast or take a salt free diet. After the [[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]], a food feast is held.{{sfn|Jagannathan|2005|p=91}}

In South India, both sculpted and live snakes are worshipped. Every village has a serpent deity. It is worshipped as a single snake or nine snakes called ''Nava Naga'' but the popular form is of two snakes in the form of an “[[Rod of Asclepius|Eaculapian rod]]”. Every worshipper in South India worships the anthill where the snakes are reported to reside. Women decorate the anthill with turmeric paste and [[vermilion|vermillion]] and sugar mixed with wheat flour. They bedeck it with flowers with the help of threads tied to wooden frames. In Maharashtra, they go round the anthill in a worship mode five times singing songs in praise of snake gods.{{sfn|Balfour|1885|p=577}}

Another form of worship practiced by women, who have no children for various reasons, install stone statues of snakes below the [[peepal tree]] and offer worship seeking blessings of the snake god for bestowing them with children. This is done as it is believed snakes represent virility and have the gift of inducing [[fecundity]] curing barrenness.{{sfn|Sharma|2008|pp=68-70}}

In [[Coorg]] in Karnataka, an ancestral platform called ''noka'' is installed with rough stones which are believed to be the ancestral incarnation in the form of snakes but they are not necessarily worshipped on Naga Panchami day.{{sfn|Sharma|2008|pp=68-70}}

In [[Kerala]], [[Nairs]] are Serpent-worshipers.  A shrine is normally established for snake god at the southwest corner of the ancestral house, along with temple for the para-devata. .{{sfn|Sharma|2008|pp=68-70}}  For Naga Panchami day, Nair Women fast the previous day. They then on the Naga Panchami Day,  take bath at dawn and pray at the tharavad Sarpa kavu . They take the Thirtham milk home.  A Chembarathi ( Hibiscus ) flower is dipped in the milk and sprinkled on the brother's back and then do an arthi. Then a thread dipped in turmeric is tied on the right wrist of the brother. After that a feast is served.

==Observance in Nepal==
The ritual is widely observed in Nepal, particularly for the fight between [[Garuda]] and a great serpent.{{sfn|Claus|Diamond|Mills |2003|p=689}} {{sfn|Brockman|2011|p=93}}

In the [[Changu Narayan Temple]] in [[Kathmandu]], there is statue of Garuda which is said to have been established by Garuda himself and on the Naga Panchami day the image is said to sweat reminiscing his great fight with a giant snake; people collect the sweat and use it for curing [[leprosy]].{{sfn|Brockman|2011|p=93}}

Sesli and E.D. Yeğenoğlu, "Determination of the genetic relationships between wild olive (''Olea europaea oleaster'') varieties grown in the Aegean region", ''Genetics and Molecular Research'' '''9'''.2 (2010:884-90) ([http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2010/vol9-2//pdf/gmr792.pdf on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; of the cultivated olive tree, ''[[Olea europea]]'', which is a tree of multiple origins&lt;ref&gt;G. Besnard, and André Bervillé, "Multiple origins for Mediterranean olive (''Olea europaea'' L. ssp. ''europaea'') based upon mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms," ''Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences'', 2000 ([http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VJ5-3YXB19D-5&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=02%2F29%2F2000&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1635056732&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=cd889c023f4a04ae21b25679e1373e4c&amp;searchtype=a on-line abstract)].&lt;/ref&gt; that was domesticated, it now appears, at various places during the fourth and third millennia BCE, in selections drawn from varying local populations.&lt;ref&gt;G. Besnard, P. Baradat, "Genetic relationships in the olive (''Olea europaea'' L.) reflect multilocal selection of cultivars", ''Theoretical and Applied Genetics'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The wild-olive (Ancient Greek ''kotinos''),&lt;ref&gt;The modern species ''[[Cotinus]]'' erected by [[Linnaeus]], is not in fact related.&lt;/ref&gt; which ancient Greeks distinguished from the cultivated olive tree (Ancient Greek ἐλάα), was used to fashion the [[olive wreath]] awarded victors at the [[ancient Olympic games]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophrastus]], ''Enquiry into Plants'', IV.13.2: "the wild-olive [''kotinos''] at Olympia, from which the wreaths for the games are made".&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus, IV.13.2 instances this tree as an instance of notable longevity among trees.&lt;/ref&gt; and sacred wild-olive tree of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] stood near the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]], patron of the games.

Today, as a result of natural hybridization and the very ancient domestication and extensive cultivation of the olive throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin]], wild-looking feral forms of olive, called "[[Oleaster (disambiguation)|oleaster]]s", constitute a complex of populations, potentially ranging from feral forms to the wild-olive.&lt;ref&gt;R. Lumaret, N. Ouazzani, H. Michaud, G. Vivie, "Allozyme variation of oleaster populations (wild olive tree) (''Olea europaea'' L.) in the Mediterranean Basin", ''Heredity'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The wild-olive is a tree of the [[maquis shrubland]], itself in part the result of the long presence of mankind.

The drought-tolerant [[sclerophyll]]ous tree is believed to have originated in the eastern [[Mediterranean Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Breton, M. Tersac ''et al.'', "Genetic diversity and gene flow between the wild olive (oleaster, ''Olea europaea'' L.) and the olive: several Plio‐Pleistocene refuge zones in the Mediterranean basin", ''[[Journal of Biogeography]]'', 2006;  for the view that the homeland of wild-olive trees is [[Anatolia]]: [http://www.olivetolive.com/Asp/Content.Asp-MS=1&amp;Content=1&amp;MN01=4&amp;MN02=0&amp;MN03=0&amp;MN04=0&amp;MN05=0&amp;ID=39.htm Pelletier (Olive and Olive Oil Publicity Committee) 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; It still provides the hardy and disease-resistant rootstock on which cultivated olive varieties are grafted.

==Greek myth and legend==
Literate Greeks recalled that the [[culture hero]] [[Aristaeus]], originator of the arts of bee-keeping, cheese-making and other innovations of the most distant past, was he who "first pressed the fruit of the oily wild-olive."&lt;ref&gt;The quote is from a late source, [[Oppian]], ''[[Cynegetica (Nemesianus)|Cynegetica]]'' 4. 265, but the theme is ancient: [http://www.theoi.com/Georgikos/Aristaios.html Theoi.com: Aristaios].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Odyssey]]'' Book V, when shipwrecked [[Odysseus]] has been cast ashore, he finds a wild-olive that has grown together with a bearing one— [[inosculation|inosculated]], an arborist would say— on the [[Scheria]]n seashore, where he crawled
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Beneath two bushy olives sprung from the same root''&lt;br&gt;
''one olive wild, the other well-bred stock''&lt;br&gt;
''No sodden gusty winds could ever pierce them...''&lt;br&gt;
''So dense they grew together, tangling side by side.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Fagles]], translator.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the fourth century BCE [[Theophrastus]], the most prominent pupil of [[Aristotle]], wrote an ''Enquiry into Plants'' that stands at the head of the literary tradition of [[botany]]. Modern botanists often struggle to identify the plants named and described by Theophrastus, and modern naming conventions often make spurious links. An example is the modern genus ''[[Cotinus]]'', which, though named after the [[ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]] ''kotinos'', is unrelated to the wild-olive.

Theophrastus noted the kinship of wild-olive with the cultivated olive,&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus, I.14.4&lt;/ref&gt; but his correspondents informed him that no amount of pruning and transplanting could transform ''kotinos'' into ''olea''.&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus, II.2.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Through lack of cultivation, he knew, some cultivated forms of olive, pear or fig might run wild, but in the "rare" case where wild-olive was spontaneously transformed to a fruit-bearing one, it was to be classed among [[portent (divination)|portent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus, II.3.1 notes fortunate and unfortunate portentious changes of pomegranates and figs, and "so again a cultivated olive may turn into a wild one, or conversely, but the latter change is rare."&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that wild kinds, such as wild pears and the wild-olive tended to bear more fruits than cultivated trees, though of inferior quality,&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus, I.4.1; III.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; but that if a wild-olive was topped it might bear a larger quantity of its inedible fruits. He noted that the leaf-buds&lt;ref&gt;Translated "knots" by A.F. Hort in the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition: Theophrastus, I.8,i-3.&lt;/ref&gt; were opposite.

Timber of the wild-olive was valued: it was proof against decay, and was not affected by [[shipworm]], which was a valuable feature in shipbuilding. It also provided stout handles for carpenters' tools.&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus, V.4.2; V.4.4.; V.7.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient wild-olive at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], from which the victors' wreaths were made, had an ''[[aition]]'', or origin myth, that was preserved in the local tradition, though the testament to it that has survived in a fragment is a late one, of the poet [[Phlegon of Tralles]], who wrote in the second century CE. It appears that in the first five [[Olympiad]]s no victor received a wreath, but before the sixth meeting for the games, the [[Elis|Eleans]], who were hosts at that time, sent their king [[Iphitos]] to [[Delphi]] to ask of [[Apollo]] whether wreaths might be awarded. The reply came back:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;''Iphitos, make not the fruit of an apple the prize of thy contest;''&lt;ref&gt;The apple was the prize in the foot-race of [[Atalanta]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''but on the victor's head set a fruitful wreath of wild-olive,''&lt;br&gt;
''Even the tree now girt with the fine-spun webs of a spider.''&lt;ref&gt;Phlegon, frag. 1, ''Fr. hist. gr.'' III, 603f. Quoted in translation and discussed in [[Arthur Bernard Cook]], ''Zeus. a Study in Ancient Religion'',  (1914) vol. 2, part 1: 466f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On his return to Olympia, Iphitos found that one among the grove of wild-olives in the [[Temenos|sacred precinct]] was wrapped in spider webs called the ''elaia kallistefanos''. "He walled it round,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://nanopdf.com/download/if-you-hear-the-herald-with-attention-you-see-that-he-announces-the_pdf nanopdf.com]:pp. 2-3 - Retrieved 2018-07-02&lt;/ref&gt; as A.B. Cook says, "and wreathed the victors from its branches."

An ancient wild-olive tree also gained a talismanic character at [[Megara]], according to Theophrastus, who noted how the wood of a tree overgrows and buries within its wood a stone placed in a hole made in its trunk:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''This happened with the wild-olive in the [[Agora|market-place]] at Megara; there was an oracle that, if this were cut open, the city would be taken and plundered, which came to pass when [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius]] took it.&lt;ref&gt;The text is defective here: ''...Demetrius...'' (Hort, ed.); the phrase is an emendation.&lt;/ref&gt; For when this tree was split open, there were found [[greave]]s and certain other things of [[Attica|Attic]] workmanship hanging there, the hole in the tree having been made at the place where the things were originally hung on it as offerings. Of this tree a small part still exists.''&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus V.2.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Heracles]]' club was wrenched from a wild-olive tree, which the city of [[Troezen]] claimed as its own, for in the late second-century CE the traveler [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] visited Troezen and recorded an ancient wild-olive with which a local legend was entwined
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Here there is also a Hermes called Polygius. Against this image, they say, Heracles leaned his club. Now this club, which was of wild-olive, taking root in the earth (if anyone cares to believe the story), grew up again and is still alive; Heracles, they say, discovering the wild-olive by the [[Saronic Gulf|Saronic Sea]], cut a club from it.''&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Theocritus]] makes Heracles tell of his contest with the [[Nemean Lion]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''I held in one hand my darts and the cloak from my shoulders, folded; with the other I swung my seasoned club about my ears and smashed it down on his head, but split the wild-olive, rugged as it was, asunder on the invincible brute's maned skull.''&lt;ref&gt;Theocritus, ''Idyll'' 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Greek wild olive varieties==
Olive tree varieties considered "ancient Greek cultivars".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FtkoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=Nitris+olive+tree&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=II1GS-ZbDh&amp;sig=NIEYSyrfLZ10RzMx2ZF9n8Ksjew&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiivPupn4DcAhVFMqwKHYNVA0YQ6AEI0AEwEQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Nitris%20olive%20tree&amp;f=false Google books]: ''Olives and Olive Oil as Functional Foods: Bioactivity, Chemistry and Processing'', By Apostolos Kiritsakis and Fereidoon Shahidi (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Jun 15, 2017, pp. 10)- Retrieved 2018-07-02&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old and New Testaments==
The [[Old Testament]] writers also distinguished the two trees: ''zayit'' designates the cultivated olive, the wild-olive being designated in the seventh century BCE Nehemiah 8:15 as '''eẓ shemen''; some modern scholars take this latter term to apply to ''[[Elaeagnus angustifolia]]'', the "Russian-olive".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=49&amp;letter=O#ixzz1DQO0yfnc ''Jewish Encyclopedia'': "Olive"]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] used the practice common in his day of [[grafting]] cultivated olive [[Scion (grafting)|scion]]s to the hardy rootstock of the wild-olive in an extended simile in ''[[Book of Romans|Romans]]'' {{Bibleverse-nb|Romans|11:17-24}}, contrasting the wild-olive tree ([[Gentiles]]) and the good "natural" olive tree (Israel): ''For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild-olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.'' In the [[Koine Greek]] of the [[New Testament]] the wild-olive has become ''agrielaios'', "of the fields", and the  cultivated tree ''kallielaios'', the "fine" one.

'''Polar stratospheric clouds''' ('''PSCs'''), also known as '''nacreous clouds''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|k|r|i|ə|s}}, from ''nacre'', or [[mother of pearl]], due to its iridescence), are [[cloud]]s in the winter polar [[stratosphere]] at altitudes of {{cvt|15000|-|25000|m|ft|sp=us}}. They are best observed during [[Twilight#Civil twilight|civil twilight]], when the Sun is between 1 and 6 degrees below the horizon, as well as in [[winter]] and in more northerly latitudes.&lt;ref name=AAD /&gt; They are implicated in the formation of [[ozone hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/hole/whyant.html#psc |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930070256/http://epa.gov/ozone/science/hole/whyant.html#psc |archivedate=2006-09-30 |title=Why is the ozone hole over Antarctica?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects on [[ozone depletion]] arise because they support chemical reactions that produce active [[chlorine]] which catalyzes [[ozone]] destruction, and also because they remove gaseous [[nitric acid]], perturbing [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and chlorine cycles in a way which increases ozone depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]] |url=http://www.wmo.int/disasters/DRR_related_Publications/Ozone/WMO_Scientific_Assessment_of_Ozone_Depletion_(2002)_e.pdf |title=Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion |year=2002}} particularly section 3.2.2 (pages 3.21, i.e. 195 of the PDF file, and following).{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The stratosphere is very dry; unlike the [[troposphere]], it rarely allows clouds to form. In the extreme cold of the polar winter, however, stratospheric clouds of different types may form, which are classified according to their [[physical state]] and [[chemical composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jastp.2007.09.011| url = https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/71369.pdf| title = Polar stratospheric cloud microphysics and chemistry| journal = Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics| volume = 70| pages = 13| year = 2008| last1 = Lowe| first1 = Douglas| last2 = MacKenzie| first2 = A. Robert| bibcode = 2008JASTP..70...13L}}{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their high altitude and the curvature of the surface of the [[Earth]], these clouds will receive sunlight from below the horizon and reflect it to the ground, shining brightly well before [[dawn]] or after [[dusk]].

PSCs form at very low temperatures, below {{convert|-78|C|F}}. These temperatures can occur in the lower [[stratosphere]] in polar winter. In the [[Antarctic]], temperatures below {{convert|-88|C|F}} frequently cause type II PSCs. Such low temperatures are rarer in the [[Arctic]]. In the [[Northern hemisphere]], the generation of [[lee waves]] by mountains may locally cool the lower stratosphere and lead to the formation of PSCs.

[[Forward scatter|Forward-scattering]] of sunlight within the clouds produces a pearly-white appearance. Particles within the [[Thin-film optics|optically thin]] clouds cause colored [[interference fringe]]s by [[diffraction]]. The visibility of the colors may be enhanced with a [[polarising filter]].&lt;ref name=AAD /&gt;&lt;ref name=wegener /&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Polar stratospheric cloud type 2.jpg|thumb|right|A type II (water) PSC showing iridescence]]

PSCs are classified into three types Ia, Ib and II according to their [[chemical composition]] which can be measured using [[LIDAR]]. The technique also determines the height and ambient temperature of the cloud.&lt;ref name=wegener /&gt;
*Type I clouds contain water, [[nitric acid]] and/or [[sulfuric acid]] and they are a source of polar [[ozone depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/psc1.htm|title=Nacreous and Polar Stratospheric Clouds|website=atoptics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Type Ia clouds consist of large, aspherical particles, consisting of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT).&lt;ref name=wegener /&gt;
**Type Ib clouds contain small, spherical particles (non-depolarising), of a liquid [[supercooled]] ternary solution (STS) of sulfuric acid, nitric acid and water.&lt;ref name=wegener /&gt;
**Type Ic clouds consist of [[Metastability|metastable]] water-rich nitric acid in a solid phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|url=http://www.agu.org/journals/jd/v101/iD04/96JD00062/96JD00062.pdf|title=The presence of metastable HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solid phases in the stratosphere inferred from ER 2 data}}{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Type II clouds, which are very rarely observed in the Arctic, consist of [[ice|water ice]] only.&lt;ref name=wegener&gt;{{cite web|last=Maturilli|first=Maturilli|title=Polar Stratospheric Clouds Above Spitsbergen|url=http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/atmospheric_circulations/research_themes/aerosol/polar_stratospheric_clouds/|publisher=[[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824200937/http://www.awi.de/en/research/research_divisions/climate_science/atmospheric_circulations/research_themes/aerosol/polar_stratospheric_clouds/|archivedate=2007-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Potting soil''', also known as '''potting mix''' or '''potting compost''', is a medium in which to grow plants, herbs and vegetables in a  pot or other durable container. The first recorded use of the term is from an 1861 issue of the ''American Agriculturist''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50185534/50185534se9?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=potting+soil&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;hilite=50185534se9 Oxford English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common ingredients used in potting soil are [[peat]], composted [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[sand]], [[perlite]] and recycled mushroom compost, although many others are used and the proportions vary hugely. Most commercially available brands have their pH fine-tuned with ground limestone; some contain small amounts of fertilizer and slow-release nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Nissen, Dante. "The Indoor Plant Bible." Page 21. Barron’s. {{ISBN|0-7641-5769-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its name, little or no [[soil]] is used in potting soil because it is considered too heavy for growing houseplants.&lt;ref&gt;Pleasant, Barbara. "The Complete Houseplant Survival Guide." Pages 314. Storey Publishing. {{ISBN|1-58017-569-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plants require potting soil that is specific for their environment. For example, an [[African violet]] would grow better in potting soil containing extra peat moss, while a cactus requires  sharp (i.e. plenty of) drainage, most commonly perlite or sand.&lt;ref&gt;Burne, Geoffrey. "Encyclopedia of Container Gardening." Page 22. Fog City Press. {{ISBN|978-1-877019-43-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; But potting soil is not ideal for all contained gardening. Insectivorous  plants, such as the [[Venus flytrap]] and the [[pitcher plant]], prefer nutrient-poor soils common to bogs and fens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/articles/17273/a-e--dirty-buttons|title=Dirty Buttons - Arts and Culture - Philly Weekly|work=philadelphiaweekly.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907025516/http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/articles/17273/a-e--dirty-buttons|archivedate=2012-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while water-based plants thrive in a heavier topsoil mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.csmonitor.com/gardening/2008/06/18/creating-a-water-garden-in-a-tub/|title=Creating a water garden in a tub|author=The Christian Science Monitor|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially available potting soil is sterilized, in order to avoid the spread of weeds and plant-borne diseases. It is possible to reuse commercial potting soil, provided that the remnants of plant roots, fungus, weeds and insects are removed from the mixture through heating before new planting can take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/lifestyle/columnists/carol-cloud-bailey-heat-potting-soil-to-prepare-it-for-replanting-ep-402745832-338716581.html|title=Carol Cloud Bailey: Heat potting soil to prepare it for replanting|author=Carol Cloud Bailey|work=TCP|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530121331/http://www.tcpalm.com/lifestyle/columnists/carol-cloud-bailey-heat-potting-soil-to-prepare-it-for-replanting-ep-402745832-338716581.html|archive-date=2016-05-30|access-date=2016-05-30|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packaged potting soil is sold in bags ranging from {{convert|5|to(-)|50|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;Reader's Digest Association. "Care-free Plants." Page 298. Readers Digest. {{ISBN|0-7621-0358-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with garden soil, potting soil can attract insects. For example, the [[fungus gnat]] is often found around houseplants because it lays eggs in moist potting soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/home/articles/0628martha0628.html|title=How to minimize dents in carpet from furniture|work=azcentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4506">In atmospheric science ([[meteorology]], [[climatology]] and related fields), the '''pressure gradient''' (typically of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], more generally of any [[fluid]]) is a physical quantity that describes in which direction and at what rate the [[pressure]] increases the most rapidly around a particular location. The pressure gradient is a dimensional quantity expressed in [[Units of measurement|units]] of pressure per unit length, or [[pascal (unit)|Pa]]/[[meter|m]]

Mathematically, it is obtained by applying the [[del operator]] to a pressure function of position. The negative gradient of pressure is known as the [[force density]]

In the [[Petroleum geology|Petroleum Geology]] and Petrochemical sciences pertaining to [[oil well]]s, and more specifically within [[Hydrostatics|Hydrostatic Pressure]], pressure gradients refer to the [[gradient]] of vertical pressure in a column of fluid within a [[wellbore]] generally expressed in [[pounds per square inch|psi]]/[[foot (unit)|ft]]. this column of fluid is subject to the compound pressure gradient of the overlying fluids. The path and geometry of the column is totally irrelevant, only the vertical depth of the column has any relevance on the vertical pressure of any point within its column and the pressure gradient for any given [[true vertical depth]].

==Physical interpretation==

Strictly speaking, the concept of pressure gradient is a ''local'' characterisation of the air (more generally of the fluid under investigation). The pressure gradient is defined only at those spatial scales at which pressure (more generally [[fluid dynamics]]) itself is defined.

Within [[planet]]ary [[atmosphere]]s (including the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth's]]), the pressure gradient is a vector pointing roughly downwards, because the pressure changes most rapidly vertically, increasing downwards, see [[vertical pressure variation]]. The value of the strength (or [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]]) of the pressure gradient in the [[troposphere]] is typically of the order 9 Pa/m (or 90 hPa/km).

The pressure gradient often has a small but critical horizontal component, which is largely responsible for the [[wind]] circulation. The '''horizontal pressure gradient''' is a 2-dimensional vector resulting from the projection of the pressure gradient onto a local horizontal plane.

Near the [[Earth's surface]], this horizontal pressure gradient force is directed from higher toward lower pressure. Its particular orientation at any one time and place depends strongly on the weather situation. At mid-[[latitude]]s, the typical horizontal pressure gradient may take on values of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Pa/m (or 10 Pa/km), although rather higher values occur within [[Surface weather analysis|meteorological fronts]].

==Weather and climate relevance==

Differences in air pressure between different locations are critical in weather forecasting and climate. As indicated above, the pressure gradient constitutes one of the main forces acting on the air to make it move as wind. Note that the [[pressure gradient force]] points from high towards low pressure zones, it is thus oriented in the opposite direction from the pressure gradient itself.

[[Sound]] waves and [[shock wave]]s are events that can induce very large pressure gradients, but these are often transitory disturbances.

==Pressure gradient in acoustics==
In [[acoustics]] the pressure gradient is proportional to the sound particle acceleration according to [[Euler's equation]].

==Early life==
Palley was born and grew up in Atlantic City, near the inlet on Massachusetts and Drexel Avenue, graduating from Atlantic City High School.&lt;ref name="Reese Palley"/&gt; His father rode horseback from Harbin Russia across China then took a steamer to San Francisco where he set up a watchmaker/jewelry shop on the docks, crossing the country and settling in Atlantic City at an unknown date. Little is known about his mother except she was from Baltimore. He had two brothers, Julian and Norman Palley. After high school Palley studied optometry at the University of Alabama for three years, then was drafted and sent as an optometrist to an army base in the Aleutian Islands.&lt;ref name="Reese Palley" /&gt; Later he worked in his father's jewelry store in Atlantic City.&lt;ref name="Reese Palley" /&gt;

==Art and business career==
After study at the [[New School for Social Research]] in Manhattan, where he was the valedictorian of the first graduating class, and at the [[London School of Economics]],&lt;ref name="Reese Palley" /&gt; Palley made his fortune in art and real estate in Atlantic City. In 1957 he opened a gallery on the Boardwalk, selling the porcelain figures of animals and birds produced by [[Edward Marshall Boehm]] and where he exhibited his "least artistically important artists",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cascone|first1=Sarah|title=Reese Palley, Adventurer|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/reese-palley-obituary-305402|publisher=Artnet.com|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]. He helped develop the [[SoHo, Manhattan]] area of New York into a stronghold for New York-based contemporary artists.&lt;ref name="RP002" /&gt; From 1959 to 1979 he owned and operated ''Objet d'Art'' Galleries in Atlantic City, NJ, SoHo/NYC, Paris, San Francisco and Palm Beach, FL, specializing in Danish furniture, Boehm porcelains and Fine Art. In San Francisco Palley restored the [[V.C. Morris Gift Shop]] at 140 Maiden Lane, the only example of a completed [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] building in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimbardo|first1=Tanya|title=Receipt of Delivery|url=https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2012/09/receipt-of-delivery15/|website=openspace.sfmoma.org|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opened shops in the late [[Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel]] in 1957 and carefully cultivated a reputation as his city’s “merchant to the rich”. Palley was successful in getting the Blenheim part of the hotel placed on the National Register of Historic Buildings, while planning to raze the Marlborough to make way for a new modern hotel.He also converted himself from a tenant at the Marlborough-Blenheim to its owner shortly before it was knocked down – and shortly after casinos were legalized in Atlantic City in 1978. In 1976 Palley and a partner purchased the Marlboro Blenheim at Boardwalk and Park Place with $100,000 down and a $16 million dollar mortgage due in nine months.  They sold it ten days later to the Bally Corp, one of the first casino deals in Atlantic City.&lt;ref name="RP002" /&gt;  In the late 1960’s Palley saw the work of [[Paul Joseph Stankard]] displayed at a craft exhibit on the boardwalk of [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]].   Enamored of the art, Palley sponsored Stankard financially, allowing Stankard to move full-time into making glass art.  Reese was an Atlantic City legend who never lost his love for the town – despite the fact that he once was a public advocate of leveling it with “a bulldozer six blocks wide.”&lt;ref name="RP002" /&gt;

==Circumnavigation of the Earth==
[[File:Dismast.jpg|thumb|Reese with de-masting tools-both types]]
After his successful real estate deal with the Marlboro Blenheim hotel, which made him wealthy, he bought an Oceanic 46 named "Unlikely VII" to sail around the world. Palley claimed it was the "longest circumnavigation on record".&lt;ref name="RP003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Art|title=Flying Fish Journal |journal=Ocean Cruising Club |date=2015|pages=225-227|url=http://www.oceancruisingclub.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his circumnavigation he was promoter of several eccentric business enterprises around the globe, living and setting up businesses in China, Odessa, Russia, and Bucharest, Romania, some more successful than others.&lt;ref name="RP003" /&gt; He claimed three sailing “firsts”, the first private sailboat allowed into China, (1982), into Russia’s (now Ukraine’s) Black Sea port of Odessa (1989) and into Romania (1990).&lt;ref name="RP003" /&gt; 
[[File:Palleyworldchart03med.jpg|thumb|Unlikely VII circumnavigation 1979-1994]]

Palley settled in [[Key West]] after the circumnavigation with his wife, the artist and sailor Marilyn Arnold Palley, where he continued his writing, completing and publishing ten books.

==Further exploits==
He was once a member of the New Jersey Lottery Commission&lt;ref name="RP001" /&gt; and was a life-long member of the [[Ocean Cruising Club]]&lt;ref name="RP003" /&gt; following a passage from [[Bermuda]] to the [[Azores]] in 1976 aboard his 32 foot sailboat ''Unlikely V'', an event listed first on his own long list of accomplishments.&lt;ref name="RP003" /&gt; He considered himself a "peddler of ideas"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soho art dealer Reese Palley |url=http://www.happening.media/category/magazine/en/news/1287/soho-art-dealer-reese-palley-has-passed-away-aged-93|website=Happening|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "a sailor first."&lt;ref name="RP003" /&gt; Palley was known for his generosity, including funding dental work as gifts for friends.&lt;ref name="RP003" /&gt; According to Steven P. Perskie, Palley's friend of fifty years and former state legislator and judge, Palley had "incredible inherent charity and good will and he cared deeply for people who couldn't take care of themselves. He was always looking to take care of the little guy - while he was making money off the big guy. He was on the edge of politics, but in the middle of the economics of it, and he was always a larger than life figure. He brought a unique kind of visibility and style to it.&lt;ref name="RP001" /&gt; Palley was a technology fan who got his first computer when [[Apple Inc]] released the [[Macintosh]] in the 1980s and was waiting for his first [[Apple watch]] when he died.&lt;ref name="RP001" /&gt;

Palley was known for wearing leopard print pants and a red beret.  His wife, Marilyn Arnold Palley, said he was an “extraordinary iconoclast” who wore his hair long and his beard wild, well before that became a fashion for men.  When asked about the red beret, Palley said “My wife, one of the strongest women in the world, is terrified of losing track of me.  She bought the red beret and said, “Thou shall wear it,”, so she can find me in a crowd.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rys |first1=Richard |title=Q&amp;A: Reese Palley|url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2011/08/04/qa-reese-palley/|publisher=phillymag.com|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 91 he created the AAUP, The American Association of Unemployed People, a national organization formed to represent the forty million unemployed in this country who have no political voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palley|first1=Reese|title=Reese Palley.com|url=http://www.reesepalley.com/|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palley received a Federal patent, #500397286, and then made the plans free to anyone who wanted to manufacture it, for an energy-efficient pop-up toaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reese Palley toaster patent|url=http://www.reesepalley.com/toaster.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He once purchased a painting at Parke Bernet for $2940 that turned out to be one of the five lost paintings by [[Raphael]], this one of [[Lorenzo de Medici]].  Owned briefly by Palley, it was sold later by [[Christie's]] in 2007 for $37.27 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christies lotfinder Lorenzo de' Medici |url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/raffaello-sanzio-called-raphael-portrait-of-lorenzo-4942823-details.aspx/ |accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palley, during his circumnavigation and in his earlier life, had many adventures and extraordinary business encounters.  As recounted in his book ''Unlikely Passages'' his adventures included starting an airline company, Atoll Air, with the support of the Minister of State of the Republic of the [[Maldives]] using [[Grumman Goose]] airplanes, starting a mushroom farm in caves, opening a sewing machine needle factory in Russia, smuggling a sought-after [[Torah]] out of [[Odessa]] on behalf of an impoverished rabbi, escaping [[Ethiopian]] gunboats on the [[Red Sea]] and discussing ideas to run an island government with [[Tristan Jones]]. He lived with an eagerness to meet and interact with all types of people in all kinds of circumstances, believing that "every moment of life is an event".&lt;ref name="RP003" /&gt; Those experiences provided the grist for at least three of his books, while another fifty of his adventures are documented at [http://www.reesepalley.com/ Reese Palley.com]

Palley with his wife, Marilyn Arnold Palley, created the Palley Index of Danish Furniture, 1900-2000, a compilation of the work of all Danish architect and/or cabinetmaker designed furniture of the 20th century. The Registry is housed at the Danish Royal Museum of Arts and Crafts in Copenhagen.  Composed of over 10,000 listings and growing, with text and photos, the Registry is supported by contemporary references using at least two historical sources and in some cases by the architects or their descendants.  Available at [https://designmuseum.dk/bibliotek/furnitureindex/ Danish Furniture Index]

Palley had a life-long interest in concrete as a historical and modern building material, perhaps sparked by his connection with the Marlboro Blenheim.  The Blenheim was the first fireproof hotel built in Atlantic City and the first poured concrete hotel in America.  At the time it was the largest poured concrete building in the world.  Construction was supervised by [[Thomas Edison]], who owned the concrete company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Janson |first1=Donald |title=Marlborough‐Blenheim Acquired By Reese Palley to Set up a Casino|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/15/archives/new-jersey-pages-marlboroughblenheim-acquired-by-reese-palley-to.html |website=nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times archives|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blenheim was the first hotel built with a private bath for every room. It also provided hot and cold running saltwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Hotels |url=http://www.monopolycity.com/ac_earlyhotels.html |website=monopolycity.com |publisher=Monopoly City |accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palley’s interest lead him to write the book ''Concrete: A Seven Thousand Year History'', as well as building a hurricane-proof concrete home in the Florida Keys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5300">The '''Sodium adsorption ratio''' ('''SAR''') is an irrigation water quality parameter used in the management of sodium-affected soils. It is an indicator of the suitability of water for use in agricultural [[irrigation]], as determined from the concentrations of the main alkaline and earth alkaline cations present in the water. It is also a standard diagnostic parameter for the '''sodicity''' hazard of a [[soil]], as determined from analysis of pore water extracted from the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2136/sssaj1954.03615995001800020004x|title=A comparison of the effects of exchangeable sodium and potassium upon the physical condition of soils|journal=Soil Science Society of America Journal|volume=18|issue=2|pages=130|year=1954|last1=Reeve|first1=R. C.|last2=Bower|first2=C. A.|last3=Brooks|first3=R. H.|last4=Gschwend|first4=F. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula for calculating the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400020011x|title=The Gapon coefficient and the exchangeable sodium percentage-sodium adsorption ratio relation|journal=Soil Science Society of America Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=258|year=1980|last1=Oster|first1=J. D.|last2=Sposito|first2=Garrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{SAR} = \frac{{Na^{+}}}{\sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2}({Ca^{2+}+Mg^{2+}})}} &lt;/math&gt;

where [[sodium]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]] concentrations are expressed in [[milliequivalents]]/liter.

SAR allows assessment of the state of [[flocculation]] or of dispersion of clay aggregates in a [[soil]]. Sodium and potassium ions facilitate the dispersion of clay particles while calcium and magnesium promote their flocculation. The behaviour of clay aggregates influences the [[soil structure]] and affects the [[Hydraulic conductivity|permeability]] of the soil whose directly depends the water infiltration rate. It is important to accurately know the nature and the concentrations of cations at which the flocculation occurs: critical flocculation concentration (CFC). The SAR parameter is also used to determine the stability of [[colloid]]s in suspension in water.

Although SAR is only one factor in determining the suitability of water for [[irrigation]], in general, the higher the sodium adsorption ratio, the less suitable the water is for irrigation. Irrigation using water with high sodium adsorption ratio may require [[Soil conditioner|soil amendments]] to prevent long-term damage to the soil.&lt;ref name="DWAF1996"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DWAF|title=South African Water Quality Guidelines: Vol. 4: Agricultural Use: Irrigation.|url=http://www.dwaf.gov.za/IWQS/wq_guide/irrigat.pdf|publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, South Africa|accessdate=21 June 2017|pages=141-153|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If irrigation water with a high SAR is applied to a soil for years, the sodium in the water can displace the calcium and magnesium in the soil. This will cause a decrease in the ability of the soil to form stable aggregates and a loss of [[soil structure]] and [[tilth]]. This will also lead to a decrease in [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and [[Hydraulic conductivity|permeability]] of the soil to water, leading to problems with [[Agriculture|crop production]]. Sandy soils will have less problems, but fine-textured soils will have severe problems if SAR is greater than 9. When SAR is less than 3, there will not be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.salinitymanagement.org/Salinity%20Management%20Guide/ls/ls_4b.html |title=Advanced topics in water chemistry and salinity |last1= Rollins |first1=Larry |date= 1 October 2007 |publisher=WateReuse Foundation |access-date= 2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of SAR addresses only the effects of sodium on the stability of soil aggregates. However, high K and Mg concentrations have also negative effects on soil permeability. The effect of potassium can be similarly treated by means of the potassium adsorption ratio (PAR).&lt;ref&gt;Sposito Garrison (2008) ''The Chemistry of Soils''. 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; ed. New York. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To take into account simultaneously all major cations present in water, a new irrigation water quality parameter was defined: the cation ratio of structural stability (CROSS), a generalization of SAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1071/SR10105|title=Cation ratio of soil structural stability (CROSS)|journal=Soil Research|volume=49|issue=3|pages=280|year=2011|last1=Rengasamy|first1=Pichu|last2=Marchuk|first2=Alla}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3733/ca.v070n02p71|title=Accounting for potassium and magnesium in irrigation water quality assessment|journal=California Agriculture|volume=70|issue=2|pages=71|year=2016|last1=Smith|first1=Chris J.|last2=Sposito|first2=Garrison|last3=Oster|first3=J.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solar halos with foreground, Salem, MA, Oct 27, 2012.JPG|thumb|right|[[Circumzenithal arc]], Supralateral arc, [[Parry arc]], and [[Upper tangent arc]], in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], Oct 27, 2012.]]

A '''supralateral arc''' is a comparatively rare member of the [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] family which in its complete form appears as a large, faintly rainbow-colored band in a wide arc above the sun and appearing to encircle it, at about twice the distance as the familiar [[22° halo]]. In reality, however, the supralateral arc does not form a circle and never reaches below the sun. When present, the supralateral arc touches the (much more common) [[circumzenithal arc]] from below. As in all colored halos, the arc has its red side directed towards the sun, its blue part away from it.

==Formation==

Supralateral arcs form when sun light enters horizontally oriented, rod-shaped [[hexagon]]al [[ice crystal]]s through a hexagonal base and exits through one of the [[prism (optics)|prism]] sides.  Supralateral arcs occur about once a year.&lt;ref name="meteoros" /&gt;

==Confusion with the 46° halo==

Due to its apparent circular shape and nearly identical location in the sky, the supralateral arc is often mistaken for the [[46° halo]], which does form a complete circle around the sun at approximately the same distance, but which is much rarer and fainter. Distinguishing between the two phenomena can be difficult, requiring the combination of several subtle indicators for proper identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it a 46° halo or a supra/infralateral arc?|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/46orsup.htm|publisher=www.atoptics.co.uk|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the static 46° halo, the shape of a supralateral arc varies with the elevation of the [[sun]].  Before the sun reaches 15°, the bases of the arc touch the [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] (oriented sidewise) sides of the 46° halo.  As the sun rises from 15° to 27°, the supralateral arc almost overlaps the upper half of the 46° halo, which is why many reported observations of the latter most likely are observations of the former.  As the sun goes from 27° to 32°, the apex of the arc touches the [[circumzenithal arc]] centered on [[zenith]] (as does the 46° halo when the sun is located between 15° and 27°).  In addition, the supralateral arc is always located above the [[parhelic circle]] (the arc located below it is the [[infralateral arc]]), and is never perfectly circular.&lt;ref name="meteoros"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.meteoros.de/arten/ee21e.htm
 | title = Supralateral arc | publisher = Arbeitskreis Meteore e.V.
 | accessdate = 2007-04-16 }} (Including a photo from January 1996, a 1980 computer simulation of a supralateral arc relative to a 46° halo, and a table pinning down differences between 46° halos and supralateral arcs.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paraselene"&gt;{{cite web

 | title = Supralateral Arcs | publisher = www.paraselene.de
 | accessdate = 2009-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably the best way of distinguishing the halo from the arc is to carefully study the difference in colour and brightness.  The 46° halo is six times fainter than the [[22° halo]] and generally white with a possible red inner edge.  The supralateral arc, in contrast, can even be confused with the [[rainbow]] with clear blue and green strokes.&lt;ref name="meteoros" /&gt;

The '''T-matrix method''' is a computational technique of [[light scattering]] by nonspherical particles originally formulated by P. C. Waterman (1928-2012) in 1965.&lt;ref name=Waterman1965&gt;Waterman, P. C. "Matrix formulation of electromagnetic scattering." Proceedings of the IEEE 53, 805-812 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;
The technique is also known as null field method and extended boundary technique method (EBCM). &lt;ref name=Mishchenko1996&gt;M. I. Mishchenko, L. D. Travis, and D. W. Mackowski, T-matrix computations of light scattering by nonspherical particles: A review, J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 55, 535-575 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; In the method, matrix elements are obtained by [[impedance matching|matching]] boundary conditions for solutions of [[Maxwell equations]].

== Definition of the T-Matrix ==

The incident and scattered electric field are expanded into spherical vector wave functions (SVWF), which are also encountered in [[Mie scattering]]. They are the [[fundamental solution]]s of the vector [[Helmholtz equation]] and
can be generated from the scalar fundamental solutions in [[spherical coordinates]], the spherical [[Bessel functions]] of the first kind and the spherical Hankel Functions. Accordingly, there are two linearly independent sets of solutions
denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}^1,\mathbf{N}^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}^3,\mathbf{N}^3&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. They are also called regular and propagating SVWFs, respectively. With this, we can write the incident field as

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{inc}= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{m=-n}^n a_{mn} \mathbf{M}^1_{mn}+ b_{mn} \mathbf{N}^1_{mn}.&lt;/math&gt;

The scattered field is expanded into radiating SVWFs:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_{scat}= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{m=-n}^n f_{mn} \mathbf{M}^3_{mn}+ g_{mn} \mathbf{N}^3_{mn}.&lt;/math&gt;

The T-Matrix relates the expansion coefficients of the incident field to those of the scattered field. 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a_{mn}\\ b_{mn}\end{pmatrix} = T \begin{pmatrix} f_{mn} \\ g_{mn} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The T-Matrix is determined by the scatterer shape and material and for given incident field allows to calculate the scattered
field.

== Calculation of the T-Matrix ==

The standard way to actually calculate the T-Matrix method is the Null-Field Method, that relies on the Stratton-Chu equations.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Stratton &amp; L.J. Chu: Diffraction Theory of Electromagnetic Waves Phys. Rev., American Physical Society, 56 (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; They basically state that the electromagnetic fields outside a given volume can be expressed as integrals over the surface enclosing the volume involving only the tangential components of the fields on the surface. If the observation point is located inside this volume, the integrals vanish.

By making use of the [[boundary conditions]] for the tangential field components on the scatterer surface
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \times (\mathbf{E}_{scat} + \mathbf{E}_{inc}) = \mathbf{E}_{int}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \times (\mathbf{H}_{scat} + \mathbf{H}_{inc}) = \mathbf{H}_{int}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[normal vector]] to the scatterer surface, one can derive an integral representation of the scattered field in terms of the tangential components of the internal fields on the scatterer surface. A similar representation can be derived for the incident field.

By expanding the internal field in terms of SVWFs and exploiting their orthogonality on spherical surfaces, one arrives at an expression for the T-Matrix. Numerical codes for the evaluation of the T-Matrix can be found online [http://www.scattport.org/index.php/light-scattering-software/t-matrix-codes/list].

'''Tattvartha Sutra''' (also known as '''Tattvarth-adhigama-sutra''') is an ancient [[Jain text]] written by ''[[Acharya (Jainism)|Acharya]]'' [[Umaswati]], sometime between the 2nd- and 5th-century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O101-TattvrthaStra.html|title=Tattvārtha Sūtra|work=encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=86}}&lt;ref name=dundaspo395&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|editor=Patrick Olivelle|title=Between the Empires : Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efaOR_-YsIcC|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-977507-1|pages=395–396}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the one of the Jain scripture written in the [[Sanskrit]] language.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=vi}} ''Tattvartha Sutra'' is also known in [[Jainism]] as the ''Moksha-shastra'' (Scripture describing the path of liberation).

The Tattvartha Sutra is regarded as one of the earliest, most authoritative text in Jainism, and the only text authoritative in both the ''[[Digambara]]'' and ''[[Śvētāmbara]]'' sects. Its importance in Jainism is comparable with that of the [[Brahma Sutras]] and [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] in [[Hinduism]]. It is a text in [[sutra]] or aphorisms, and presents the complete Jainism philosophy in 350 sutras over 10 chapters.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=82}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K. V. Mardia|title=The Scientific Foundations of Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_VCbRgKKNYC|year=1990|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0658-0|page=103|quote= '''Quote:''' Thus, there is a vast literature available but it seems that Tattvartha Sutra of Umasvati can be regarded as the main philosophical text of the religion and is recognized as authoritative by all Jains."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Tattvartha'' is composed of the Sanskrit words ''[[Tattva (Jainism)|tattva]]'' which means "reality, truth" and ''artha'' which means  "nature, meaning", together meaning "nature of reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1=Hemacandra|author2=R. C. C. Fynes| title=The Lives of the Jain Elders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=quNpKVqABGMC | year=1998| publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-283227-6|page=xxxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sir Monier Monier-Williams|author2=Ernst Leumann|author3=Carl Cappeller|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUezTfym7CAC|year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3105-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its sutras, ''[[Parasparopagraho Jivanam]]'' is the motto of Jainism. Its meaning is interpreted as "(The function) of souls is to help one another",{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=72}} or "Souls render service to one another".{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|p=131}}

==Names==
''Tattvartha Sutra'' is also known in Jainism as the ''Moksha-shastra'' (Scripture describing the path of liberation).{{sfn|Cort|2001|p=16-17}}{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=}}

== Content ==
The text written in [[Sanskrit]],{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=48}} begins with an invocation:{{quote|I bow to the Lord, the promulgator of the path to liberation, the destroyer of mountains of karmas and the knower of the whole of reality, so that I may realize these qualities.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=1}}}}
The first verse of ''Tattvārthsūtra'', "{{lang|sa|सम्यग्दर्शनज्ञानचारित्राणि मोक्षमार्ग:}}" summarizes the Jaina path to liberation. It means that the [[Ratnatraya]] (three jewels: right view, right knowledge and right conduct) collectively constitutes the path to liberation or [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]].{{sfn|Cort|2001|p=16-17}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=2}}

Its ten chapters are:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=xi}}
#Faith and Knowledge
#The Category of the Living
#The Lower World and the Middle World
#The Celestial Beings
#The Category of the Non-Living
#Influx of Karma
#The Five Vows
#Bondage of Karma
#Stoppage and Shedding of Karma
#Liberation

[[File:Samyak Darsana Chart.jpg|thumb|Chart showing Samyak Darsana as per Tattvarthasutra]]
The first chapter deals with the process of cognition and details about different types of knowledge. The next three chapters deal with the [[Jīva (Jainism)|Jīva]] (soul), lower worlds, ''naraka'', and celestial abodes, ''[[Deva (Jainism)|devas]]''. The fifth chapter discusses the Non-soul (''[[Ajiva|ajīva]]''). The next three chapters deal with the ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' and their manifestations and the influx, ''[[asrava]]'', good and bad ''karma'', ''shubha-ashubha karma'' and the [[Bandha (Jainism)|bondage of the karmas]]. The ninth chapter describes the blocking, ''[[samvara]]'' and shedding of the karmas, ''[[nirjara]]''. The final chapter discusses ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' or the liberation of the soul.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=82}}

===Seven categories of truth===
The theology in ''Tattvartha Sutra'' presents seven categories of truth in sutra 1.4:{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|p=xviii-xx, 2-3, 6}}
#Souls exist ([[Jīva (Jainism)|Jeeva]])
#Non-sentient matter exists ([[Ajiva|Ajeeva]])
#Karmic particles exist that inflow to each soul ([[Asrava|Aasrava]])
#Karmic particles bind to the soul {which transmigrate with rebirth} ([[Bandha (Jainism)|Band]]) 
#Karmic particles inflow can be stopped ([[Samvara|Samvar]])
#Karmic particles can fall away from soul ([[Nirjara]])
#Complete release of karmic particles leads to liberation from worldly bondage ([[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]])

Umaswami categorizes the types of knowledge to be empirical, attained through one's sense of perception. He adds that knowledge is also acquired through literature, clairvoyance, and omniscience.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=12-15}} In chapter 2, Umaswati presents sutras on soul. He asserts that soul is distinguished by suppression of deluding karma, or elimination of eight types of karmas, or partial presence of destructive karmas, or arising of eight types of new karmas, or those that are innate to the soul, or a combination of these.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=33-62}} In chapter 3 through 6, Umaswati presents sutras for his first three categories of truth.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=7-168}}

===Ethics===
{{Main|Ethics in Jainism}}
In chapter 7, Umaswati presents the Jaina vows and explains their value in stopping karmic particle inflow to the soul. The vows, with their respective translations by Nathmal Tatia, are 
:*''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' (abstinence from violence)
:* ''[[Satya|anirta]]'' (abstinence from falsehood)
:* ''[[asteya]]'' (abstinence from stealing)
:* ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (abstinence from carnality), and
:* ''[[aparigraha]]'' (abstinence from possessiveness).{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=169-170}}

===Karma and rebirths===
{{Main|Karma in Jainism}}
Umaswati, in chapter 8 of ''Tattvartha Sutra'' presents his sutras on how [[karma]] affects rebirths. He asserts that accumulated karma in life determines the length of life and realm of rebirth for each soul in each of four states – infernal beings, plants and animals, human beings and as gods.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=195-199}}{{Sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=118-119}} Further, states Umaswati, karma also affects the body, the shape, the characteristics as well as the status of the soul within the same species, such as ''Ucchi'' (upper) or ''Nicchi'' (lower) status.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=195-199}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=118-119}} The accumulated and new karma are material particles, states Umaswati, which stick to the soul and these travel with the soul from one life to the next as bondage, where each ripens.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=200-203}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=121-124}} Once ripened, the karmic particles fall off, states Umaswati.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=200-203}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=121-124}}

===Shedding karma and liberation===
{{Main|Moksha (Jainism)}}
The chapter 9 of ''Tattvartha Sutra'' states how karmic particles can be stopped from attaching to the soul and how these can be shed.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=213-248}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=126-145}} Umaswati asserts that ''gupti'' (curbing activity), ''[[dharma]]'' (virtues such as forbearance, modesty, purity, truthfulness, self-restraint, austerity, renunciation), contemplation, endurance in hardship (he lists twenty two hardships including hunger, thirst, cold, heat, nakedness, injury, lack of gain, illness, praise, disrespect), and with good character towards others (he lists five – equanimity, reinitiation, non-injury ([[Ahimsa]]), slight passion and fair conduct), a soul stops karmic accumulations.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=126-145}} External austerities such as fasting, reduced diet and isolated habitation, along with internal austerities such as expiation, reverence, service, renunciation and meditation, according to Umaswati, along with respectful service to teachers and ailing ascetics help shed karma.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=126-145}}

The state of liberation is presented in Chapter 10 by Umaswati.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=250-263}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=146-151}} It is achieved when deluding and obstructive karmas have been destroyed.{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=250-263}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=146-151}} This leads to the state of quietism and potentiality, and the soul then moves to the end of the universe, states Umaswati.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=146-151}}

==Importance==
The Tattvartha Sutra is regarded as one of the earliest, most authoritative book on [[Jainism]], and the only text authoritative in both the [[Digambara]] and [[Śvētāmbara]] sects,{{sfn|Cort|2001|p=16-17}}.

== Commentaries and Translations ==

=== Commentaries ===
The Tattvartha Sutra has the largest number of Jaina [[bhashya]]s or commentaries in different Indian languages from the fifth century onward. The total number of commentaries and translations of ''Tattvartha Sutra'' goes beyond 25.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=48}}

The most famous and oldest commentary on the ''Tattvārthasūtra'' is ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'' of ''Ācārya [[Pujyapada]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnxjAAAAMAAJ|title=Prolegomena to Prakritica et Jainica|author1=Banerjee|first1=Satya Ranjan|year=2005|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=}} (sixth century CE). ''Sarvārthasiddhi'' along with [[Akalanka]]'s c. 780 CE ''Rajavartika'' and Vijayananda's ''Slokavarttika'' (9th century) form the central texts of Digambara monastic students.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=82}}

===Translations===
The text is in ''sutra'' form. The word ''Sutra'' ([[Sanskrit]]: सूत्र) means "string, thread".&lt;ref name=winternitz249&gt;M Winternitz (2010 Reprint), A History of Indian Literature, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802643}}, pages 249&lt;/ref&gt; The root of the word is ''siv'', that which sews and holds things together.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssutra&gt;Monier Williams, Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Entry for [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/1200/mw__1274.html ''Sutra''], page 1241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacGregor|first=Geddes|title=Dictionary of Religion and Philosophy|year=1989|publisher=Paragon House|location=New York|isbn=1557780196|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of Indian literature, ''Sutra'' means a distilled collection of syllables and words, any form or manual of "aphorism, rule, direction" hanging together like threads with which the "teachings of ritual, philosophy, grammar or any field of knowledge" can be woven.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamssutra/&gt;&lt;ref name=winternitz249/&gt;

The distilled nature of sutra texts leave them open to varying interpretations. The Tattvartha sutra have been variously translated. The first verse of ''Tattvartha Sutra'' has been translated as follows, for example:

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
"The enlightened [[Darśana|darsana]] (world view), enlightened knowledge and enlightened conduct are the path to liberation" – Translated by Nathmal Tatia{{sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|pp=5-6}}

"Right faith, right knowledge and right conduct constitute the path to liberation" – Translated by Vijay Jain{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=2}}
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Umaswati, ''Tattvartha Sutra'' 1.1}}

The text has been translated into many languages including English and German, latest being English translation in 1993.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=48}}

'''The Forbidden Forest of The Upper Cibeet River''' is a [[sacred]] wooded area in an old [[tropical forest]] [[Dayeuhluhur, Cilacap|Dayeuhluhur]], in the north [[Cilacap Regency]] of [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]].

==Key Keeper==
Visitors must be accompanied by a '''Key Keeper,''' to ensure proper respect for [[Dayeuhluhur]]ian culture. They claim the forest to be one of spirituality. The [[Juru Kunci]], or key keeper is Ceceng Rusmana from [[Cibeet River]].

==Flora and fauna==

[[File:Lancahtanduk.jpeg|thumb | This horned spider, the long-horned orb weaver (''Macracantha arcuata''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tumblr.com/search/long%20horned%20orb%20weaver|title=The Long-Horned Orb Weaver|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is common in this forest.]]
Similar to [[Ujung Kulon National Park]], the forest hosts tropical and rare animals and trees, including many [[Rusa (genus)|''Rusa'' (genus)]] [[Javan leopard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tempo.co/read/news/2013/09/28/206517382/Trapped-Leopard-to-Released-into-Nusakambangan-island|title=Trapped Leopard Released on NusaKambangan Island|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[monkey]]s. People in this area believe that the [[Javan tiger]] and [[banteng]] still live there. This forest also contains many species of wild [[orchid]].
[[File:Redbevcibeet.jpeg|thumb | Wild orchids at Upper Cibeet forest]]

==River source==
Many rivers have their headwaters in the region of the Upper Cibeet. Some drain to the north into the [[Java Sea]] like Cipamali River, while others drain to the south in the [[Indian Ocean]], like the [[Cibeet River]], [[Cidayeuh River]] and [[Cikawalon River]].

==Mitos==

A common belief in Mitos forbids speaking or asking about anything seen in the forest. Another holds that spitting (showing disrespect) while in the forest will cause leeches to attack, making them the real guardian.

==Blood worm (leech)==
[[File:Cibeetleech.jpeg|thumb |The Upper Cibeet leech: It starts this small when first sucking our blood, but will soon grow to the size of our finger.]]

The blood worm (Pacet) is common in the forest. This [[leech]] does not live in water but crawls everywhere on land and trees, not unlike the [[worm]] or [[caterpillar]], in search of animals (including people) to feed on.

A '''therapeutic garden''' is an outdoor [[garden]] space that has been specifically designed to meet the physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs of the people using the garden as well as their caregivers, family members and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horowitz|first1=Sala|title=Therapeutic Gardens and Horticultural Therapy: Growing Roles in Health Care|journal=Alternative and Complementary Therapies|date=20 April 2012|volume=18|issue=2|pages=78–83|doi=10.1089/act.2012.18205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapeutic gardens can be found in a variety of settings, including hospitals, skilled [[nursing homes]], [[assisted living residences]], [[continuing care retirement communities]], out-patient cancer centers, [[hospice]] residences, and other related healthcare and residential environments.  The focus of the gardens is primarily on incorporating plants and friendly wildlife into the space.  The settings can be designed to include active uses such as raised planters for [[horticultural therapy]] activities or programmed for passive uses such as quiet private sitting areas next to a small pond with a trickling waterfall.

Some research indicates that the natural environment is related to the [[longevity]] and [[quality of life]] of the [[elderly]]. Precisely, the natural therapeutic [[landscapes]], and the [[therapeutic garden]]) contributes to active and healthy aging in the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2015 |volume=60 | title=Physical-social environments and aging population from environmental gerontology and geography.

==Nature==
We are all connected to nature and it is important to maintain this vital connection for our health and well-being, which is described in the work ‘The Biophilia Hypothesis’ by [[Edward O. Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Biophylia Hypothesis", Stephen R. Kellert and Edwared O. Wilson. Island Press, 1003. {{ISBN|1-55963-147-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=September 2018}}

==History==
The American Horticultural Therapy Association (AHTA) Definitions and Positions Paper draws a distinction between a therapeutic garden and a healing garden.&lt;ref&gt;American Horticultural Therapy Association, Definitions &amp; Positions (2012). {{cite web |url=http://ahta.org/sites/default/files/DefinitionsandPositions.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908221648/http://ahta.org/sites/default/files/DefinitionsandPositions.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AHTA defines a healing garden as "plant dominated environments including green plants, flowers, water, and other aspects of nature. They are generally associated with hospitals and other healthcare settings, designated as healing gardens by the facility, accessible to all, and designed to have beneficial effects on most users." On the other hand, a therapeutic garden is "designed for use as a component of a treatment program such as occupational therapy, physical therapy, or horticultural therapy programs and can be considered as a subcategory of a healing garden." A therapeutic garden can be described as being therapeutic in nature when it has been designed to meet the needs of an individual or group. Individuals or groups strive to improve their well-being through active engagement by using plants and engaging in activities ranging from planting, growing and maintaining plants.

Horticulture has been soothing man's senses as early as 2000 BC in Mesopotamia. Lush agricultural plots lay in the fertile river valleys between the Tigris and Euphrates providing agriculture and inspiration for the first designed gardens in this typical arid landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe &amp; Susan Jellicoe. The Landscape of Man: Shaping the Environment from Prehistory to the Present Day, London, UK: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd, 1975. {{ISBN|9780500340615}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 5th century AD, gardens were generally perceived to contribute to the improvement of health and have been used as a place of respite from travels, to serve as a place to recover or recuperate from an illness, or to simply isolate the sick or infirm from the healthy individuals. Gardens located within Christian hospices in the Middle Ages emphasized charity and hospitality. Monasteries ministering to the sick and the insane incorporated an arcaded courtyard where they could find the some shelter, sun, or shade in a human-scale, enclosed setting.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben M. Rainey, "The Garden in the Machine: Nature returns to the High-Tech Hospital," SiteLines, A Journal of Place, Volume 5, Number 11, Spring 2010, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th to the 19th century, the increased need for hygiene during treatment led to the acceptable uses of "sanitary reforms"&lt;ref&gt;Williams G. The Age of Miracles - Medicine and Surgery in the Nineteenth Century. Chicago, IL: Academy Chicago Publishers, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  such as cross-ventilation, access to sunlight and gardens. The 20th century ushered in the discovery of germ theory, advances in medical science theories, the biomedical model, and improved technology in the medical sciences.

The biomedical model, derived from Louis Pasteur's germ theory of disease, became the predominant conceptual model used by physicians in diagnosing disease. According to the biomedical model, health constitutes the freedom from disease, pain, or defect, thus making the normal human condition "healthy".&lt;ref&gt;George L. Engel, "The Need for a New Medical Model: A Challenge for Biomedicine", Science, New Series, American Association for the Advancement of Science , Vol. 196, No. 4286, 1977, pp. 129-136.&lt;/ref&gt; The biomedical model of health focuses solely on biological factors, and excludes psychological, environmental, and social influences. This narrow focus rationalized and streamlined not only medical diagnosis but also medical processes. Infection reduction, cost effectiveness and operational efficiency became the norm in the design of medical facilities. "Pressure from insurance companies to minimize hospital stays have largely worked against the provision of actual usable gardens in new or refurbished medical complexes.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clare Cooper Marcus|Marcus, Clare Cooper]] and Marni Barnes. Gardens in Healthcare Facilities: Uses, Therapeutic Benefits, and Design Recommendations. The Center for Health Design, Inc. CA, 1995, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, gardens were no longer perceived as settings that could contribute to the restoration of the patient's health. Nature and gardens were relegated to the beautification of entrances; small "pocket" areas were used as focal points; sidewalks and even parking areas.

In response to the reductionistic scope of the biomedical model, several medical researchers and scientists such as George Engel strongly believed that "…a medical model must also take into account the patient, the social context in which he lives, and the complementary system devised by society to deal with the disruptive effects of illness, that is, the physical role and the health care system. This requires a biopsychosocial model."&lt;ref&gt;George L. Engel, "The Need for a New Medical Model: A Challenge for Biomedicine", Science, New Series, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Vol. 196, No. 4286, 1977, pp. 129-136.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the impact of the physical environment on the well-being and health of the patient has received extensive academic research and attention. In 1984, Roger Ulrich conducted a ground-breaking study comparing the positive effect of views of natural scenery, i.e., trees, on the recovery of patients from surgery to patients in similar conditions who were exposed to a view of a brick wall. He was the first to use the standards of modern medical research—strict experimental controls and quantified health outcomes—to demonstrate that gazing at a garden can sometimes speed healing from surgery, infections and other ailments.  Ulrich showed that in comparison with the wall-view group, the patients with the tree-view had the following results: shorter post-operative hospital stays; fewer negative evaluative comments from nurses; took less medication, and slightly lower scores for minor post-surgical complications.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Ulrich. "View through a window may influence recovery from surgery." Science. 1984, 224(4647):420e1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Dr. Stokols proposed a concept of health promotive environments&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Daniel Stokols, "Establishing and maintaining healthy environments: Toward a social ecology of health promotion". The American Psychologist, 1992, Vol. 47, pp. 6-22.&lt;/ref&gt; that involves the physical and social features of the physical environment and how they affect the overall well-being of individuals and groups.

[[Enid A. Haupt Glass Garden|Enid Haupt Glass Garden]]: Combining horticultural therapy with medical therapy – Built in 1959, the garden is part of the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine at New York University. The Rusk Institute is one of the world's leading centers for rehabilitation medicine. Dr. Howard Rusk, a pioneer in rehabilitation of physical disabilities convinced Enid Haupt to donate a greenhouse amidst the increase of returning World War II soldiers and polio patients. The garden started simply as a peaceful retreat from hospital treatment or rehabilitation; but has grown to incorporate a program of horticultural therapy in the 1970s. Trained horticultural therapists work with patients in the therapeutic garden to identify, nurture and learn from plants. Ultimately, the goal is to make therapy seem like a respite.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Gerlach-Spriggs, Richard Kaufman, Sam Bass Warner Jr. Restorative Gardens: The Healing Landscape: Yale University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mother / Child Garden at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility: Garden of Connection and Compassion –Gardens have been used in U.S. prisons since at least the 19th century for vocational training and therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Amy L. Lindemuth. Correctional facilities are often associated with stressful social interactions within stark, imposing institutional settings. Journal of Mediterranean Ecology Vol. 8, 2007. Firma Effe Publisher, Reggio Emilia, Italy: pp87-97.&lt;/ref&gt;   The Mother / Child Garden at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility located in Bedford, New York is part of an innovative program created in 2005 that recognizes family and motherhood as a transformative process for female inmates.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Winterbottom, Amy Wagenfeld. Therapeutic Gardens: Design for Healing Spaces: Timber Press Inc., 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The garden acts as a meeting place for mothers and their visiting children to reconnect. It is natural setting that relieves the stresses of incarceration and separation, renewing bonds of nurturing and compassion amidst mature and shady linden trees, newly planted trees, perennial beds, play equipment, arbors and picnic tables. Within this enclosed and safe setting, families enjoy togetherness, free of judgment and the harsh realities imposed on their lives.

[[Cleveland Botanical Garden|Elizabeth &amp; Nona Evans Restorative Garden]]: Combining landscape design and modern medical technology in a public setting – Recipient of the 2005 Therapeutic Garden Design Award by the AHTA&lt;ref&gt;American Horticultural Therapy Association, http://ahta.org/about/grants-and-awards&lt;/ref&gt;  and the 2006 Honor Award in Design from the ASLA.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Landscape Architects, https://asla.org/awards/2006/06winners/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Cleveland Botanical Garden, the therapeutic garden reflects the mission of the Botanical Garden to "blend education, social responsibility, cultural and environmental stewardship.".&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Landscape Architects, https://www.asla.org/awards/2006/06winners/294.html&lt;/ref&gt; This restorative garden uses a "best practices" approach to therapeutic gardens. It combines design and medical technology advances learned in a hospital setting and applied in a publicly accessible space. The result is a deep understanding of the dynamic between public and private spaces. A balance is effectively struck between the public botanical garden where all visitors are welcome to stroll and the privacy and security that some visitors to the therapeutic garden would want and need. The garden is composed of three unique settings, each with a distinct character and level of activity: one for quiet contemplation; one for both individual exploration and teaching large groups; and one for horticultural therapy. The desire to create a sense of welcome and accommodation for all, regardless of ability, was a significant consideration in details and the selection of materials. The Elizabeth &amp; Nona Evans Restorative Garden is designed by Dirtworks Landscape Architecture, PC, New York, NY.

The '''Toarcian''' is, in the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]]' [[geologic timescale]], an [[age (geology)|age]] and [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] in the [[Early Jurassic|Early or Lower Jurassic]]. It spans the time between 182.7 [[Megaannum|Ma (million years ago)]] and 174.1 Ma.&lt;ref name="benton, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|title=Prehistoric Life|year=2012|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0-7566-9910-9|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It follows the [[Pliensbachian]] and is followed by the [[Aalenian]].&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed geologic timescale see Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toarcian age began with the [[Toarcian turnover]], the [[extinction event]] that sets its fossil faunas apart from the previous [[Pliensbachian]] age.

==Stratigraphic definitions==
The Toarcian takes its name from the city of [[Thouars]], just south of [[Saumur]] in the [[Loire Valley]] of [[France]]. The stage was introduced by French palaeontologist [[Alcide d'Orbigny]] in 1842, after examining [[stratum|rock strata]] of this age in a [[quarry]] near Thouars.

In Europe this period is represented by the upper part of the [[Lias Group|Lias]].

The base of the Toarcian is defined as the place in the stratigraphic record where the [[ammonite]] [[genus]] ''[[Eodactylites]]'' first appears. A global reference profile (a [[GSSP]]) for the base is [[List of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points|located]] at [[Peniche, Portugal]]. The top of the stage is at the first appearance of ammonite genus ''[[Leioceras]]''.

In the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys domain]], the Toarcian contains the following ammonite [[biozone]]s:
*zone of ''[[Pleydellia|Pleydellia aalensis]]''
*zone of ''[[Dumortieria|Dumortieria pseudoradiosa]]''
*zone of ''[[Phlyseogrammoceras|Phlyseogrammoceras dispansum]]''
*zone of ''[[Grammoceras|Grammoceras thouarcense]]''
*zone of ''[[Haugia|Haugia variabilis]]''
*zone of ''[[Hildoceras|Hildoceras bifrons]]''
*zone of ''[[Harpoceras|Harpoceras serpentinum]]''
*zone of ''[[Dactylioceras|Dactylioceras tenuicostatum]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13104">A '''volcanic winter''' is a reduction in global temperatures caused by [[volcanic ash]] and droplets of [[sulfuric acid]] and water obscuring the [[Sun]] and raising Earth's [[albedo]] (increasing the reflection of solar radiation) after a large, particularly explosive [[volcano|volcanic eruption]]. Long-term cooling effects are primarily dependent upon injection of [[sulfur]] gasses into the [[stratosphere]] where they undergo a series of reactions to create [[sulfuric acid]] which can nucleate and form aerosols.&lt;ref name="Robock, Alan 2000"&gt;Robock, Alan (2000).

An examination of [[ice core]]s showed a large spike in [[sulfate]] deposition around 1257. This was strong evidence of a large eruption having occurred somewhere in the world. In 2013, scientists proved that the eruption occurred at Mount Samalas. This eruption had four distinct phases, alternately creating [[eruption column]]s reaching tens of kilometres into the atmosphere and [[pyroclastic flow]]s burying large parts of Lombok Island. The flows destroyed human habitations, including the city of [[Pamatan]]. Ash from the eruption fell as far away as [[Java|Java Island]]. The volcano deposited more than {{convert|10|km3}} of material. The eruption was witnessed by people who recorded it on [[palm leaves]], the ''Babad Lombok''. Later volcanic activity created additional volcanic centres in the caldera, including the Barujari cone that remains active. The [[aerosol]]s injected into the atmosphere reduced the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, which cooled the atmosphere for several years and led to famines and crop failures in Europe and elsewhere, although the exact scale of the temperature anomalies and their consequences is still debated. It is possible that the eruption helped trigger the [[Little Ice Age]].

'''535:''' The [[extreme weather events of 535–536]] are most likely linked to a volcanic eruption. The latest theorised explanation is the Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption of the [[Ilopango]] caldera in central [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Dull, R., J.R. Southon, S.

A proposed volcanic winter occurred around 71,000–73,000 years ago following the [[supervolcano|supereruption]] of [[Lake Toba]] on [[Sumatra]] island in [[Indonesia]]. In the following 6 years there was the highest amount of volcanic [[sulfur|sulphur]] deposited in the last 110,000 years, possibly causing significant [[deforestation]] in [[Southeast Asia]] and the cooling of global [[temperature]]s by 1&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Oppenheimer02&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Oppenheimer C. |title=Limited global change due to the largest known Quaternary eruption, Toba ~ 74 Kyr BP |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |volume=21 |pages=1593–609 |year=2003

The causes of the [[population bottleneck]]&amp;nbsp;– a sharp decrease in a [[species]]' population, immediately followed by a period of great genetic divergence ([[genetic divergence|differentiation]]) among survivors&amp;nbsp;– is attributed to volcanic winters by some researchers. Such events may diminish populations to "levels low enough for evolutionary changes, which occur much faster in small populations, to produce rapid population differentiation".&lt;ref name=Burroughs&gt;Burroughs, William James (2005). ''Climate Change in Prehistory: The End of the Reign of Chaos,'' Cambridge University Press, p. 139 {{ISBN|978-0521824095}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the [[Lake Toba]] bottleneck, many species showed massive effects of narrowing of the gene pool, and Toba reduced the human population to between 15,000 and 40,000 or even fewer.&lt;ref name=Burroughs/&gt;

'''World population milestones''' were unnoticed until the 20th  century, since there were no reliable data on [[global population]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Vaclav Smil, [http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/mgs/5-2-smil.pdf "Global Population: Milestones, Hopes, and Concerns"], ''Medicine &amp; Global Survival'', October 1998; Vol. 5, No. 2, 105–108&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the population of the world reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It would be another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to rise by another billion people, reaching three billion in 1960. Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, by some estimates, seven billion in October 2011 with other estimates being in March 2012.&lt;ref name=UN7bn&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643 |title=Population seven billion: UN sets out challenges|date=26 October 2011|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-10-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is projected to reach eight billion by 2024–2030. According to current projections, the world's population is likely to reach around nine billion by 2035–2050, with alternative scenarios ranging from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion.&lt;!--Please don't cull these references.

==Global billionth milestones==
There is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed each of the one and two billion marks. The days of three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the [[United States Census Bureau]] places them in July 1959 and April 1974.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

'''The Day of Five Billion''', 11 July 1987, was designated by the [[United Nations Population Fund]] as the approximate day on which [[world population]] reached five billion.  '''Matej Gašpar''' from [[Zagreb]], Croatia (then [[SR Croatia]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]), was chosen as the symbolic 5-billionth person concurrently alive on [[Earth]].  The honor went to Zagreb because the [[1987 Summer Universiade]] was taking place in the city at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ankica Barbir-Mladinović|title=Petomilijarditi "Zemljanin": Ne slušati stereotipe|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/petomilijarditi_zemljanin_ne_slusati_stereotipe/24269206.html|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=1 October 2011|language=Croatian|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB123EF931A25754C0A961948260|title=And Baby Makes Five billion: U.N.

National or subnational governments have sometimes made similar designations based on the date estimated by a demographic agency. Some national milestones relate to [[citizen]]s rather than [[residency (domicile)|resident]]s. Commentators in countries with high [[immigration]] have pointed out that a population milestone may be reached by an immigrant rather than [[Rate of natural increase|natural increase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-16/australias-population-reaches-24-million/7170274|title=Australia's population hits 24 million people, ABS clock shows|date=2016-02-16|work=[[ABC Online]] |quote=The ABS said it was unclear whether the 24 millionth Australian was a newborn or a migrant|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/baby-reed-is-one-in-23-million-almost/story-fngr8hax-1226627384262|title=Baby Reed is one in 23 million as Australia's population hits a milestone|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |location= Sydney, Australia |quote=He said the 23rd millionth person could be a newborn but could equally be a person coming to work in Australia or a returning backpacker who had been away for more than a year.|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1565">'''Xocomil''' is a weather phenomenon in [[Lake Atitlán|Lake Atitlan]], [[Guatemala]].

== Causes ==
The xocomil is created by air pressure differences between the lake and the surrounding mountains when temperature rises and the hotter air on land attracts colder air from the lake. It usually develops around noon.&lt;ref name="PL xocomil"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prensalibre.com/ciudades/solola/xocomil-el-fenomeno-del-lago-de-atitlan-que-hizo-volcar-una-lancha-con-17-personas|title=Xocomil, el fenómeno del Lago de Atitlán que hizo volcar una lancha con 17 personas|last=Pérez|first=César|date=14 November 2018|website=Prensa Libre|trans-title=Xocomil, the Lake Atitlan phenomenon that made a boat with 17 people flip|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116010421/https://www.prensalibre.com/ciudades/solola/xocomil-el-fenomeno-del-lago-de-atitlan-que-hizo-volcar-una-lancha-con-17-personas|archive-date=16 Nov 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=16 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
Among local legends, one is about the tragic tale of a [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] couple. A [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchiquel]] warrior Utzil ran away with the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] princess Zacar, and were chased by her people. Utzil went to look for help from a caiman to cross the lake but when he returned, he found the princess dead. He then took her body and threw himself into the lake. In the afternoons, the couple plays in the lake and the xocomil blows so they can be left alone.&lt;ref name="PL xocomil"/&gt;
