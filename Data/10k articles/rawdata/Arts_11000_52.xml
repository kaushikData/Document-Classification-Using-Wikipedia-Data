'''''A Flag is Born''''' is a 1946 play that advocated the creation of a [[homeland for the Jewish people]] in the ancient [[Land of Israel]]—at the time of the play's release [[Mandatory Palestine]], under British administration. With a cast including [[Paul Muni]], [[Celia Adler]] and [[Marlon Brando]], it opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on September 4, 1946.  It was written by [[Ben Hecht]] and directed by [[Luther Adler]], with music by [[Kurt Weill]].  ''A Flag is Born'' was produced by the American League for a Free Palestine, an organization headed by [[Hillel Kook]] (known in America by the anglicized name Peter Bergson), to raise money for Zionist causes.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"&gt;{{cite web

==Synopsis==
''A Flag is Born'' has three principal characters, with other actors playing bit roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=[[The Broadway League]]
|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tevye and Zelda (played on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] by [[Paul Muni]] and [[Celia Adler]], major stars at the time) are survivors of the [[Treblinka]] death camp who are attempting to travel to British-administered [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], the ancient [[Land of Israel]]. David ([[Marlon Brando]]) is an angry young [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor.

The play opens with Tevye and Zelda ushering in the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]] on a Friday night somewhere on their journey. Zelda lights [[Shabbat candles|candles]] on a broken tombstone. After reciting the Sabbath prayers, Tevye dreams of the town where he was born, as it was before the Nazis destroyed it.  A dream sequence follows in which Tevye has visions of the biblical kings [[Saul]] and [[David]], then imagines himself standing before the [[United Nations Security Council]] pleading for the formation of a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish homeland]] in Palestine; he is ignored.

Tevye awakens to find that Zelda has died in the night. He recites ''[[kaddish]]'', a Jewish memorial prayer, then welcomes the [[Destroying angel (Bible)|Angel of Death]], who has come for him too. He bids David farewell. As David considers committing suicide, three Jewish soldiers (representing the [[Haganah]], [[Irgun]], and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]) suddenly appear and implore him to join them: "Don't you hear our guns David? We battle the English, the sly and powerful English. We speak to them in a new Jewish language, the language of guns. We fling no more prayers or tears at the world. We fling bullets. We fling barrages&amp;nbsp;... We promise to wrest our homeland out of the British claws."&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Kai: ''Divided City: Coming of Age Between the Arabs and Israelis''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wertheim&gt;Wertheim, Albert: ''Staging the War: American Drama and World War II'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

In the play's finale, David delivers a fiery pro-Zionist speech, moves across a bridge into Palestine, and with the mixed sounds of "[[Hatikvah]]" and gunfire in the background, raises Tevye's [[Tallit|prayer shawl]] as a makeshift flag and marches off to war.&lt;ref name=Wertheim/&gt;

==Zionist causes==
[[File:ExodusSh2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Jews, largely [[Holocaust survivors]], sailing for [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] aboard the [[SS Exodus|SS ''Exodus'']] in 1947. ''A Flag is Born'' was produced to support such migrants.]]
''A Flag is Born'' was produced by the pro-Zionist American League for a Free Palestine (ALFP) to raise financial and political support for Zionist causes, including the transport of Jews from Europe. The AFLP was entirely open about its political motivations—publicity materials read: "'A Flag is Born' is not ordinary theatre. It was not written to amuse or beguile. 'A Flag is Born' was written to make money—to make money to provide ships to get Hebrews to Palestine&amp;nbsp;... and [to] arouse American public opinion to support the fight for freedom and independence now being waged by the resistance in Palestine."&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt;

In promoting the play, the [[Bergson Group]] attempted to equate the Zionist organizations in Palestine with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] of the [[American Revolution]].  The cover of the program showed three Zionists—one with a rifle, one with a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]], and one with a Zionist flag—superimposed over three American Revolutionary figures.  Advertisements used the slogan "It's 1776 in Palestine!", portrayed members of the Irgun as "modern-day [[Nathan Hale]]s," alluded to "taxation without representation" in Palestine, and quoted [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s phrase, "Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God."  When Tevye dreams about addressing the United Nations, he compares Palestine in the 1940s with the American colonies in the 1770s.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt; ''A Flag is Born'' played in six North American cities and raised more than $400,000 for the ALFP, the largest block of funds it ever attained.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt;

Brando had already been voted "Broadway's Most Promising Actor" for his role as an anguished veteran in ''[[Truckline Café]]'', but that play was not a commercial success and Brando was still young, relatively unknown and impecunious.  Brando contended that the survivors of the Holocaust deserved to have their own land where they could live freely; he accepted only the [[Actor's Equity]] minimum payment so more of the proceeds from ''A Flag is Born'' could go towards Zionist causes.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Reception and impact==

After the play proved extremely popular,{{fact|date=May 2015}}{{weasel-inline|date=May 2015}} the Broadway run was extended and a tour was arranged.{{fact|date=May 2015}}  The sponsoring committee included many prominent people, including composer [[Leonard Bernstein]], novelist [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], New York City Mayor [[William O'Dwyer]], and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].{{fact|date=May 2015}}

Following the Broadway run, ''A Flag is Born'' traveled to Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Boston. It was also scheduled to play at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theater]] in Washington, D.C.  However, in an early action of the [[civil rights movement]], Americans who opposed racial discrimination began a boycott to oppose the practice of barring blacks from attending Washington theaters, and the committee moved the play to the [[Maryland Theater (Baltimore)|Maryland Theater]] in [[Baltimore]].  A special train brought members of Congress to the performance.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt;  The American League for a Free Palestine and the [[NAACP]] cooperated to use the occasion to force the management of the Maryland Theater to abrogate its segregation policy (blacks restricted to the balcony) for the duration of the play's run which, in the context of the times, was considered a victory for civil rights.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt;

'''''A History of the Mind: Evolution and the Birth of Consciousness''''' is a 1992 book about the [[mind–body problem]] by the psychologist [[Nicholas Humphrey]]. The book received positive reviews, but Humphrey's hypothesis about consciousness has been criticized as speculative.

==Summary==
Humphrey describes his book as "a partial history of a part of what constitutes the human mind: an evolutionary history of how sensory consciousness has come into the world and what it is doing there." He discusses the views of the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and the philosophers [[Colin McGinn]] and [[Daniel Dennett]].{{sfn|Humphrey|1992|pages=xiii, xv, 5, 41, 170}}

==Publication history==
''A History of the Mind'' was first published by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] in 1992.{{sfn|Humphrey|1992|page=iv}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''A History of the Mind'' received a positive review from Francisca Goldsmith in ''[[Library Journal]]'' and a negative review from John C. Marshall in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.{{sfn|Goldsmith|1992|page=70}}{{sfn|Marshall|1992|page=8}} The book was also reviewed by M. Kohn in ''[[New Statesman|New Statesman and Society]]'',{{sfn|Kohn|1992|page=39}} and by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'',{{sfn|''Publishers Weekly''|1992|page=56}} ''[[New Scientist]]'',{{sfn|''New Scientist''|1992|page=45}} and ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.{{sfn|''The New York Times Book Review''|1992|page=33}}

Goldsmith wrote that the book would appeal to both "interested lay readers" and scholars.{{sfn|Goldsmith|1992|page=70}} Marshall criticized Humphrey's style of writing and wrote that his "account of the evolutionary development of consciousness" was "highly speculative" and so lacking in precision and detail that it was questionable whether it could be considered a theory. He added that Humphrey's comparison of the senses of vision and hearing to those of touch, pain, smell and taste was contradicted by physiological evidence.{{sfn|Marshall|1992|page=8}}

===Scientific and academic journals===
''A History of the Mind'' received a positive review from ''[[The Lancet]]''. It described the book as an "entertaining and well-thought out work" and Humphrey's attempt to "solve the riddle of perception, sensation, and consciousness" as brave. It considered his ideas a possible basis for "a new neurophysiology", but criticized him for misinterpreting Coleridge.{{sfn|''The Lancet''|1992|page=595}}

===Evaluations in books===
[[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]], writing in ''[[Why Freud Was Wrong]]'' (1995), called ''A History of the Mind'' one of the most interesting attempts to solve the mind–body problem. He suggested that Humphrey succeeded in eliminating mind-body dualism entirely, although he noted that details of Humphrey's hypothesis remain speculative and open to criticism and that the hypothesis was rejected by McGinn.{{sfn|Webster|2005|page=484}} The paleoanthropologist [[Donald Johanson]], writing with Blake Edgar in ''From Lucy to Language'' (1996), noted that Humphrey's hypothesis about consciousness places a different emphasis on feeling and thinking than the hypothesis about consciousness put forward by Dennett in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' (1991).{{sfn|Johanson|Edgar|1996|page=107}}

'''Art world economics''' is a relatively unexplored area of [[financial]] exchange that exists at the edges of the regular financial industry. Investment in [[art]] has been an accepted form of deposit investment for several decades such as the purchase of works by [[Matisse]], [[Van Gogh]] and [[Picasso]]. However these works only have an assured value as long as there is a restricted supply of works on the open market - i.e. the artist is dead or producing small numbers of works and that the [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]] of works can be verified by a small number of sources. In the case of contemporary artists it is the interest of collectors and therefore dealers to ensure a tightly controlled line of supply.

The intricacies of [[art world]] economics were exposed by the suit of the family of [[Mark Rothko]] against the Marlborough Fine Art Gallery brought during the 1970s. In an action known as the [[Rothko Case]], it was determined that Marlborough had knowingly manipulated their management of Rothko's works to maintain a higher sale price after his death, to the detriment of Rothko's family's interest in his estate.

The art market was hit by the 2008 financial crash; sales were down about 41 per cent by 2009, compared with a market peak of almost $66bn in 2007. Contemporary art was particularly badly hit, with sales in that category plunging almost 60 per cent over the two years 2008-09. However, by 2011 the value of sales had almost reached the record level of 2007, and they have remained between $56bn and $68bn in the years since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Boom amid the bust |url=https://www.ft.com/content/9c5e3fe8-85ea-11e8-9199-c2a4754b5a0e |website=The Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creative Capital''' is a New York City-based, national non-profit which provides awards and advisory services to artists in 34 different disciplines, including visual art, performing arts, moving image and literature. Artists receive the Awards through an open application process.

== History ==
Creative Capital was founded in 1999 with Ruby Lerner as the founding director, president and Executive Director. As of May 2016, the Executive Director is Suzy Delvalle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/arts/design/creative-capital-chooses-susan-delvalle-as-president-and-executive-director.html|title=Creative Capital Chooses Susan Delvalle as President and Executive Director|first=Joshua|last=Barone|date=10 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its first year, Creative Capital accepted 1,810 applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dobrzynski|first=Judith|title=1,810 Artists Seek Grants From a New Foundation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/25/arts/1810-artists-seek-grants-from-a-new-foundation.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=9 October 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=25 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in part to offer support to artists affected by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]' (NEA) cuts to funding for individual artists in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="nymag-murphy" /&gt;

== Business model and artist services==
The Harvard Business School published a case study of the Creative Capital business model on March 24, 2010 titled "Creative Capital: Sustaining the Arts." In a description of the study, authors G. Felda Hardymon and Ann Leamon wrote about Creative Capital’s use of a venture capital model, investing in their awardees with money as well as advice on managing their careers so that they can continue improving their careers after they’ve spent the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardymon|first=G. Felda|author2=Ann Leamon|title=Creative Capital: Sustaining the Arts|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=March 24, 2010|pages=24|accessdate=9 October 2012|url=https://hbr.org/product/creative-capital-sustaining-the-arts/an/810098-PDF-ENG}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of that sustainability, Creative Capital's system stipulates that awardees whose projects make a profit return a portion of those profits to the organization. Also, many former awardees of Creative Capital become advisors for new awardees.

Creative Capital's approach to artist services centers on the idea that time and advisory services are as important to the creative process as money.  As the awardee's funded project develops, Creative Capital staff meets with awardees to set goals and chart progress. Creative Capital provides funding at benchmark moments for each project, including initial funding, support to build the artist’s personal and professional capacity, follow-up support for project production, funding for the project’s premiere, and support for the project’s expansion beyond its premiere presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Approach|url=http://creative-capital.org/approach|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of this type of support, Sheryl Oring, a Creative Capital awarde, has said, "For mid-career artists like me, Creative Capital can help make the difference between whether we keep making art or give up."&lt;ref name="nymag-murphy" /&gt;

==Retreat==
After each new round of awardees is announced, Creative Capital hosts a retreat for their artists, including the most recently announced awardees, those from the previous round, other awardees as consultants as well as people connected to Creative Capital in various ways who act as consultants, workshop leaders or observers. In various workshops and meetings with consultants, artists are taught how to plan the next five years of their lives, in terms of their artistic careers as well their own lives.&lt;ref name="nymag-murphy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Tim|title=Bohemian Boot Camp|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/19151/|publisher=nymag.com|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative Capital hosts a variety of events for its awardees to meet each other and others within the artistic community. Paddy Johnson has written in her noted arts blog, Art Fag City, "These conferences offer grantees an amazing opportunity to connect with other artists and a wide range of curators, distributors, and artistic directors through mixers, meetings with consultants, and artist presentations. They also ask grantees to return to the conference every couple of years, which keeps them in touch with a constantly expanding network of creative art folk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Paddy|title=Expanding The Creative Capital Network|url=http://www.artfagcity.com/2012/07/30/expanding-the-creative-capital-network/|publisher=Art Fag City|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional Development Program==
In 2003, Creative Capital founded its Professional Development Program (PDP) which offers a series of evening-, one-day- or weekend-length workshops for artists on marketing, strategic planning, self-management, fundraising, web strategies. In both presenting these workshops in-person nationally and broadcasting some online in the form of "webinars," the program shares skills taught to Creative Capital grantees with other artists across the U.S. These workshops have been described as a “crash course in self-management, strategic planning, fundraising and promotion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Annie|title=Workshop brings 'creative capital'|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/print-edition/2011/06/03/workshop-brings-creative-capital.html|accessdate=10 October 2012|newspaper=Nashville Business Journal|date=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dexter''' and '''sinister''' are terms used in [[heraldry]] to refer to specific locations in an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] bearing a [[coat of arms]], and to the other elements of an [[Achievement (heraldry)|achievement]]. "Dexter" (Latin for "right")&lt;ref name="cawley"&gt;{{cite web | last = Cawley | first = Kevin | authorlink = |author2=Florin Neumann |author3=Matt Neuberg |author4=Lynn Nelson  | title = Latin Dictionary and Grammar Aid | publisher = [[University of Notre Dame]] Archives |date=2012 | url = http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=dext&amp;ending=er | accessdate = 2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; means to the right from the viewpoint of the bearer of the shield, ''i.e.'' the bearer's [[proper right]], to the left from that of the viewer.

[[Image:Bend Sinister demo.svg|thumb|200px|''Argent a '''bend sinister''' gules''. The bend sinister extends upward to the sinister corner and generally denotes [[wikt:bastardy|bastardy]]. Usually the bend extends upward to the dexter corner of a shield.]]

==Significance==
The dexter side is considered the side of greater [[honour]], for example when [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] two arms. Thus, by tradition, a husband's arms occupy the dexter half of his shield, his wife's paternal arms the sinister half. The shield of a bishop shows the arms of his [[Episcopal see|see]] in the dexter half, his personal arms in the sinister half. King [[Richard II]] adopted arms showing the attributed arms of [[Edward the Confessor]] in the dexter half, the [[royal arms of England]] in the sinister. More generally, by ancient tradition, the guest of greatest honour at a banquet sits at the right hand of the host. The [[Bible]] is replete with passages referring to being at the "right hand" of God.

Sinister is used to mark that an ordinary or other charge is turned to the heraldic left of the shield. A ''[[bend (heraldry)|bend]] sinister'' is a bend which runs from the bearer's top left to bottom right, as opposed to top right to bottom left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Friar|editor1-first= Stephen|editor1-link= Stephen Friar|page=58|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|date=1987|location=London|publisher= Alphabooks Ltd./[[A &amp; C Black|A &amp; C Black Plc]]|isbn=0 906670 44 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the shield would have been carried with the design facing outwards from the bearer, the bend sinister would slant in the same direction as a sash worn diagonally on the left shoulder.

This division is key to [[dimidiation]], a method of joining two coats of arms by placing the dexter half of one coat of arms alongside the sinister half of the other. In the case of marriage, the dexter half of the husband's arms would be placed alongside the sinister half of the wife's. The practice fell out of use as early as the 14th century and was replaced by [[impalement (heraldry)|impalement]], as in some cases, it could render the arms that are cut in half unrecognizable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=118|last1=Woodcock|first1=Thomas|author-link1=Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|last2=Robinson|first2=John Martin|author-link2=John Martin Robinson|title=The Oxford Guide to Heraldry|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=1988|isbn=0-19-211658-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8E1mAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=unrecognizable}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases, it would result in a shield that looked like one coat of arms rather than a combination of two.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The [[Great Seal of the United States]] features an eagle clutching an [[olive branch]] in its dexter talon and arrows in its sinister talon, indicating the nation's intended inclination to peace. In 1945, one of the changes ordered for the similarly arranged [[Flag of the President of the United States]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] was having the eagle face towards its right (dexter, the direction of honor) and thus towards the olive branch.&lt;ref&gt;Truman issued {{EO|9646}} on October 25, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/TheEagleAndTheShield/The%20Eagle%20and%20the%20Shield#page/n495/mode/2up|title=The Eagle and the Shield: A History of the Great Seal of the United States|last=Patterson|first=Richard Sharpe|last2=Dougall|first2=Richardson|publisher= Washington : Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Dept. of State : for sale by the Supt. of Docs., U.S. Govt.

==Origin==
The sides of a [[shield]] were originally named for the purpose of military training of knights and soldiers long before heraldry came into use early in the 13th century so the only viewpoint that was relevant was the bearer's. The front of the purely-functional shield was originally undecorated.

It is likely that the use of the shield as a defensive and offensive weapon was almost as developed as that of the sword itself and so the various positions or strokes of the shield needed to be described to students of arms. Such usage may indeed have descended directly from Roman training techniques that were spread throughout Roman Europe and then continued during the age of [[chivalry]], when heraldry came into use.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

{{Fantasy}}
'''Fantastic art''' is a broad and loosely defined [[art]] [[genre]].&lt;ref name="jahsonic" /&gt; It is not restricted to a specific school of artists, geographical location or historical period.  It can be characterised by subject matter – which portrays non-realistic, mystical, [[mythical]] or [[folklore|folkloric]] subjects or events – and style, which is representational and naturalistic, rather than abstract - or in the case of magazine illustrations and similar, in the style of [[graphic novel]] art such as [[manga]].

Fantasy has been an integral part of art since its beginnings,&lt;ref name="Schurian"/&gt; but has been particularly important in [[mannerism]], [[magic realism|magic realist]] painting, [[romantic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], [[surrealism]] and [[lowbrow (art movement)|lowbrow]]. In French, the genre is called le [[fantastique]], in English it is sometimes referred to as ''visionary art'', ''grotesque art'' or [[mannerism|mannerist art]]. It has had a deep and circular interaction with [[fantasy literature]].

The subject matter of Fantastic Art may resemble the product of hallucinations, and Fantastic artist [[Richard Dadd]] spent much of his life in mental institutions.  [[Salvador Dalí]] famously said: "the only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=thinkexist.com |url=http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_only_difference_between_me_and_a_madman_is/175604.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130804105007/http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_only_difference_between_me_and_a_madman_is/175604.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 August 2013 |accessdate=4 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some recent Fantastic Art draws on the artist's experience, or purported experience, of [[hallucinogenic drugs]].

The term '''Fantasy Art''' is closely related, and is applied primarily to recent art (typically 20th century onwards) inspired by, or illustrating, fantasy literature.  The term has acquired some pejorative overtones.

Fantastic art has traditionally been largely confined to painting and illustration, but since the 1970s has increasingly been found also in photography. Fantastic art explores fantasy, imagination, the dream state, the [[grotesque]], visions and the uncanny,&lt;ref name="Schurian"&gt;Schurian, Walter (2005) Beyond Mere Understanding. In: ''Fantastic Art'', Schurian, W. &amp; Grosenick, U. (Ed.), [[Taschen]], p.6-25. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-2954-7}} (English edition)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as so-called "[[Goth]]" art.

==Related genres==
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}
Genres which may also be considered as Fantastic Art include the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] of the [[Victorian era]], and [[Surrealism]].  Works based on classical mythology, which have been a staple of European art from the [[Renaissance]] period, also arguably meet the definition of Fantastic Art, as art based on modern mythology such as [[JRR Tolkien]]'s [[Middle Earth]] mythos unquestionably does.  [[Religious art]] also depicts supernatural or miraculous subjects in a naturalistic way, but is not generally regarded as Fantastic Art.

== Historic artists and fine artists ==
Many artists have produced works which fit the definition of fantastic art.  Some, such as [[Nicholas Roerich]], worked almost exclusively in the genre, others such as [[Hieronymus Bosch]], who has been described as the first "fantastic" artist in the Western tradition,&lt;ref name="Schurian"/&gt;  produced works both with and without fantastic elements, and for artists such as [[Francisco de Goya]], fantastic works were only a small part of their output.  Others again such as [[René Magritte]] are usually classed as Surrealists but use fantastic elements in their work. It is therefore impossible to give an exhaustive list of fantastic artists, but a selection of major and influential figures is listed below.&lt;ref name=jahsonic&gt;{{cite web|title=Jahsonic, a vocabulary of culture|url=http://www.jahsonic.com/FantasticArt.html|accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=David (ed.)|title=Fantastic Art|year=1973|publisher=Pan Ballantine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] "pulp" magazines demanded artwork to illustrate stories and (via cover art) to promote sales.  This led to a movement of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] artists prior to and during the Great Depression, as anthologised by [[Vincent Di Fate]], himself a prolific SF and [[space]] artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Fato|first=Vincent|title=Infinite Worlds: The Fantastic Visions of Science Fiction Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in the 1930s, a group of Wisconsin artists inspired by the Surrealist movement of Europe created their own brand of fantastic art. They included [[Madison, Wisconsin]]-based artists Marshall Glasier, Dudley Huppler and [[John Wilde]]; Karl Priebe of [[Milwaukee]] and [[Gertrude Abercrombie]] of [[Chicago]]. Their art combined macabre humor, mystery and irony &lt;ref&gt;Sara Krajewski, “Surreal Wisconsin: Surrealism and its Legacy of Wisconsin Art,” Madison Art Center, 1998  http://members.aol.com/MenuBar/surreal/surreal.htm accessed 3/26/2003&lt;/ref&gt; which was in direct and pointed contradiction to the [[American Regionalism]] then in vogue.

In postwar [[Chicago]], the art movement [[Chicago Imagism]] produced many fantastic and grotesque paintings, which were little noted because they did not conform to New York [[abstract art]] fashions of the time.  Major imagists include [[Roger Brown (artist)|Roger Brown]], [[Gladys Nilsson]], [[Jim Nutt]], [[Ed Paschke]], and [[Karl Wirsum]].&lt;ref name=Vine&gt;Richard Vine, "Where the Wild Things Were", ''[[Art in America]]'', May 1997, pp. 98-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-European Art==
Non-European art may contain fantastic elements, although it is not necessarily easy to separate them from religious elements involving supernatural beings and miraculous events.

== Plot ==
A group of women arrive by bus to a small town in the depopulated central [[Province of Guadalajara]], where there is a scarcity of single women and economic opportunities. The men have organized an annual party to get to know available ladies with the hopes of falling in love and finding a wife. Women hope to find stability, companionship, immigration papers or a combination of the three.

The group of women include: Marirrosi, a divorced nurse from [[Bilbao]] who is lonely and looking for love; Patricia, a young woman with two children from the [[Dominican Republic]] who has been in Spain illegally and having difficulties to find decent work; and (joining later) Milady, a young Cuban who wants to see the world at any cost. They come to the town filled with eager men but not lots of opportunities other than farming. Patricia settles with Damian, a hardworking farmer who lives with his mother, Gregoria. Looking to find stability for her young children and a hard worker herself, Patricia tries in vain to find common ground with her stern mother-in-law, who seems to reject her because of her skin color and the fact that her son is no longer under her control. Patricia, with more time and experience in Spain, befriends the newcomer Milady. Milady settles with Carmelo an older Spanish man who wooed her in [[Havana]]. Carmelo tries to impress her with a big television and modern kitchen, but what she really wants to do is go to discos and have fun. She is in no way ready to settle down. Her dream of a life in Europe is very different from his fantasy of life with a gorgeous young wife. Milady is flirty and does not love Carmelo. Wanting to see the sea in Valencia, she takes a ride from a truck driver. When she comes back to town, the jealous Carmelo gives her a beating. Milady wishes she could leave him, but she has few friends and no real place to go.

Marirrosi, the oldest of the three women, has a grown up son and is tired of her job in Bilbao. She finds love with Alfonso, a gentle soft-spoken gardener. However, she is unwilling to give up city life for fields and cows, while he is unwilling to even consider living in a city. Unable to resolve their differences, she eventually breaks up with him.

At the farm, Patricia receives the visit of some of her friends and this creates confrontation with Gregoria, but Damian comes to Patricia’s defense and the relation between the two women improves. However the father of Patricia’s two children reappears in her life wanting to take advantage of her steadier situation. In a frank talk with Damian, Patricia admits that if she could have found work and been able to take care for herself either in the Dominican Republic or Spain, she probably wouldn't have married him. But now that she is there, she realizes that she wants to be his companion and stable love. Damian and Patricia have an argument after her honest revelation. He believes that she is taking advantage of him and he tells her to leave with her children. At the last minute, persuaded by his mother, Damian stops them from leaving and he and Patricia reconcile. Later on, we see Patricia’s daughter making her first communion in the local church.

Milady captures the attention of Oscar, a young man infatuated with her. He helps her escape the town but in a stop in a hotel she also leaves him, taking the road on her own. Carmelo deals alone with his disappointment of Milady’s sudden departure.

Alfonso is devastated when he receives Marirrosi’s letter breaking up with him. At the village’s bar Alfonso gives some advice to the local single men. Another bus, full of hopeful single women, is arriving in town.

[[File:Title page William Shakespeare's First Folio 1623.jpg|thumb|240px|The title page of the Shakespeare [[First Folio]], 1623]]
The term "'''folio'''", from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''folium'' (leaf),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Beal | first = Peter | year = 2008 | contribution = folio | title = A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000 | edition = Online | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/ | accessdate = 22 November 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has three interconnected but distinct meanings in the world of books and printing.  It is firstly a term for a common method of arranging sheets of paper into book form, folding the sheet only once, and a term for a book made in this way.  Secondly, it is a general term for a sheet, leaf or page in (especially) manuscripts and old books, and thirdly, an approximate term for the size of a book, and for a book of this size.

Firstly, a folio (abbreviated '''fo''' or '''2°''') is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper, on each of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded once to produce two [[leaf (books) |leaves]].  Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. Ordinarily, additional printed folio sheets would be inserted inside one another to form a group or "gathering" of leaves prior to binding the book.

Secondly, "folio" is used in terms of [[page numbering]] for some books and most [[manuscript]]s that are bound but without page numbers as an equivalent of "page" (both sides), "sheet" or "leaf", using "[[recto and verso|recto]]" and "[[recto and verso|verso]]" to designate the first and second sides, and (unlike the usage in printing) disregarding whether the leaf concerned is actually physically still joined with another leaf. This usually appears abbreviated: "f26r." means the first side of the 26th leaf in a book.  This will be on the right hand side of the opening of any book composed in a script that is read from left-to-right, such as [[Latin script |Latin]] (as used in English), [[Cyrillic script |Cyrillic]], or [[Greek script |Greek]], and will be opposite for books composed in a script that is read from right-to-left, such as [[Hebrew script |Hebrew]] and [[Arabic script  |Arabic]].

Thirdly, ''folio'' is also used as an approximate term for a size of book, typically about {{convert |15|in|cm}} tall, and as such does not necessarily indicate the actual printing format of the books, which may even be unknown as is the case for many modern books. Other common book formats are ''[[quarto]]'' and ''[[octavo]]'', which are both also printing formats, involving two and three folds in the sheet respectively.

Famous folios (in both senses) include the [[Gutenberg Bible]], printed in about 1455, and the [[First Folio]] collected edition of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, printed in 1623; however, their actual size is rather different.

== Format ==
A folio (from Latin foliō, abl. of folium, leaf &lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2d ed, (1989), on line access.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper, on each sheet of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded one time to produce two leaves.  Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. This contrasts with a [[quarto]], folding each sheet twice, and [[octavo]], folding each sheet three times.  Unlike the folio, these last, and further types involving more folds, require the pages of the book to be cut open after binding, which might be done mechanically by the printer, but in historic books was often left for the reader to do with a [[Paper knife|paper-knife]].

[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|left|Lenox copy of the Gutenberg bible printed in folio format.]]
There are variations in how folios are produced.  For example, bibliographers call a book printed as a folio (two leaves per full sheet), but bound in gatherings of 8 leaves each, a "folio in 8s." &lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald B. McKerrow]], ''An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students'', Oxford 1927 and later eds., p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gutenberg Bible]] was printed in about 1455 as a folio, in which four pages of text were printed on each sheet of paper, which were then folded once.  The page size is 12 x 17.5 inches (307 x 445&amp;nbsp;mm), a "double folio" size.  Several such folded conjugate pairs of leaves were inserted inside one another to produce the sections or gatherings, which were then sewn together to form the final book.  Shakespeare's [[First Folio]] edition is printed as a folio and has a page height of 12.5 inches (320&amp;nbsp;mm), making it a rather small folio size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/dl_crosscollex/brbldl/oneITEM.asp?pid=2018031&amp;iid=1071364&amp;srchtype= Beinecke Library, Yale]&lt;/ref&gt;

Folios were a common format of books printed in the [[incunabula]] period (books printed before 1501), although the earliest printed book, surviving only as a fragment of a leaf, is a [[Sibyllenbuch fragment|quarto]]. The [[British Library]] [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]] currently lists about 28,100 different editions of surviving books, pamphlets and broadsides (some fragmentary only) printed before 1501,&lt;ref&gt;[http://istc.bl.uk/search/search.html?operation=search&amp;rsid=9450&amp;sort=idx-year Search of Incunabula Short Title Catalog for imprints before 1501, sorted by date.  Search done July 12, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;  of which about 8,600 are folios,&lt;ref&gt;[http://istc.bl.uk/search/search.html?operation=search&amp;rsid=9461&amp;sort=idx-year British Library, Incunabula Short Title Catalogue, search for imprints before 1501 and format as "fo", sorted by year.  Search done July 12, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; representing just over 30 percent of all works in the catalogue.

== Page numbering ==
[[File:Recto and verso.svg|thumb|230px|Left-to-right language books (such as English)]]
[[File:Recto and verso RTL.svg|thumb|230px|Right-to-left language books (such as Arabic)]]
{{Main|Recto and verso}}

In the discussion of manuscripts, a folio means a leaf with two pages, the [[recto]] being the first the reader encounters, and the [[verso]] the second. In Western books, which are read by turning the pages over from right to left, when the book is begun with the open page edges at the reader's right, the first page to be seen is "folio 1 recto", typically abbreviated to "f1 r.". When this page is turned over "f1 v." is on the left and "f2 r." on the right of the "opening", or two pages that are visible.  For books in Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and other languages, where the book is begun from the back in Western terms, with the open page edges at the reader's left, the numbering also follows the sequence in which the reader encounters.

In the discussion of two-columned manuscripts, a/b/c/d can denote the left and right-hand columns of recto and verso pages (e.g. "f. 150a" and "f. 150b" are the left and right hand columns on the recto page, and "f. 150c" and "f. 150d" the left and right hand columns on the verso page).  In the discussion of three-columned manuscripts, notation may make use of folio number + recto/verso + column a/b/c (e.g. "f. 3 v. col. c" references the third column on the verso side of the third folio).

== Size ==

The actual size of a folio book depends on the [[Paper size|size of the full sheet of paper]] on which it was printed, and in older periods these were not standardized, so the term's meaning is only approximate. Historically, printers used a range of names such as (with approximate maximum page height): Double Elephant Folio (50 inches, 127&amp;nbsp;cm), Atlas Folio (25 inches, ca 63&amp;nbsp;cm), Elephant Folio (23 inches, ca 58&amp;nbsp;cm), Royal Folio (20 inches, ca 51&amp;nbsp;cm), Medium Folio (18 inches, ca 46&amp;nbsp;cm), and (the most common) Crown Folio (15 inches, ca 38&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trussel.com/books/booksize.htm|title=Book Sizes|work=trussel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-nineteenth century, technology permitted the manufacture of large sheets or rolls of paper on which books were printed, many text pages at a time.  As a result, it may be impossible to determine the actual format (i.e., number of leaves formed from each sheet fed into a press).  The term "folio" as applied to such books may refer simply to the size, i.e., books that are approximately 15&amp;nbsp;inches (38&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

== Shakespeare folios ==

From the earliest days of printing, folios were often used for expensive, prestigious volumes.   In the Seventeenth Century, plays of the [[English Renaissance theatre]] were printed as collected editions in folio.  Thirty-six of Shakespeare's plays, for example, were included in the [[First Folio]] collected edition of 1623, which was followed by additional folio editions, referred to as the [[Second Folio]], etc. Other playwrights in this period also published their plays in folio editions, such as [[Ben Jonson]]'s collected works of 1616.

The '''Frari Triptych''' or '''Pesaro Triptych''' is a 1488 oil on panel [[triptych]] painting by [[Giovanni Bellini]]. It is signed and dated 1488 on the centre of the Virgin Mary's throne, though it may have taken several years to produce, meaning he started it in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;Fry&lt;/ref&gt; On the reverse is a label dating its completion more precisely, to 15 February 1488.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Anchise Tempestini, ''Giovanni Bellini'', Catalogo Completo, Cantini, Firenze 1992. {{ISBN|88-7737-105-6}}, Kat. 60, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the [[basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] in [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Mariolina Olivari, ''Giovanni Bellini'', in AA.VV., ''Pittori del Rinascimento'', Scala, Firenze 2007. {{ISBN|88-8117-099-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its central scene is the Madonna and Child enthroned with two angel musicians, flanked to the left by [[saint Nicholas of Bari]] and [[saint Peter]] and to the right by [[saint Mark]] (patron of Venice) and [[saint Benedict]]. The work's division into compartments is rather old-fashioned and may have been explicitly demanded by the commissioner, but Bellini uses this to his advantage, integrating the painted architecture with the frame, which he designed himself. This develops the illusionism of his [[San Giobbe Altarpiece]], again placing the Virgin in a deep blue mantle on a high marble throne, using a golden light and a Byzanto-Venetian-style apse. To the sides thin strips of landscape suggest a vast space behind the work, whilst the [[trompe l'oeil]] apse behind the Virgin bears an inscription reading &lt;small&gt;IANUA CERTA POLI DUC MENTEM DIRIGE VITAM: QUAE PERAGAM COMMISSA TUAE SINT OMNIA CURAE&lt;/small&gt; ("Certain gate of heaven, guide [my] mind, direct [my] life: may everything I do be entrusted to your care").&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Rona Goffen, ''Devozione e committenza.

'''Giannini''' is a traditional fine [[musical instruments]] maker in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_sr_musical-instruments?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-brandtextbin=Giannini&amp;node=11091801 | title=Musical Instruments - Giannini| publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | accessdate=16 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded in 1900 by [[Tranquillo Giannini]], an [[Italy|Italian]] immigrant with [[luthier]] talents.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Their first industrial plant was located at Av. Sao Joao in the city of [[São Paulo]].

Today, Giannini's plant is located at [[Salto, São Paulo|Salto]], a city in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] (not far from the capital).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} They currently produce nylon and steel stringed guitars, [[craviola]], [[viola caipira]], [[cavaquinho]], [[mandolin]], violins, electric guitars and basses and some accessories such as guitar tuners and guitar strings.

==Craviola==

The Craviola, created by Giannini with Brazilian musician [[Paulinho Nogueira]] is one of the most notable guitars made by Giannini due to its unique shape and sound identity. It gained widespread visibility after it was used by [[Led Zeppelin]]'s guitarist [[Jimmy Page]]. From September 1971 to June 1972, Page used a 12-string craviola, model GWSCRA12-P, mostly in Zeppelin's performances of "[[Tangerine (Led Zeppelin song)|Tangerine]]", which was also first recorded using the same craviola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.led-zeppelin.org/studio-and-live-gear/1015 | title=Giannini GWSCRA12-P Craviola Acoustic - Led Zeppelin: Achilles Last Stand | accessdate=November 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Page received two craviolas (one with six strings and the other, by his request, with twelve) from Giannini itself as gifts, while visiting his NGO at [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giannini.com.br/novo/noticia_detalhe.asp?cod_noticia=78 |title=Jimmy Page recebe Craviola de presente da Giannini |accessdate=November 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105161353/http://www.giannini.com.br/novo/noticia_detalhe.asp?cod_noticia=78 |archivedate=November 5, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Craviola also received an electric version with [[Wilkinson guitar and bass hardware|Wilkinson]] pickups. The guitar's wiring has one 3-position key for each of the pickups, which allow them to work with one coil, the other one, both as a humbucker or both separately as single coils, giving a wide range of possible timbres, aside from the regular 3-position key for alterning between both pickups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giannini.com.br/novo/produto.asp?id=1341 |title=Guitarra Craviola GCRA-202 EL FM - Produtos - Giannini Instrumentos Musicais |accessdate=November 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105161939/http://www.giannini.com.br/novo/produto.asp?id=1341 |archivedate=November 5, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1970, it advances Althusser's theory of [[ideology]]. Where [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] posited a thinly-sketched theory of ideology as [[false consciousness]], Althusser draws upon the works of later theorists such as [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]] to proffer a more elaborate redefinition of the theory. Althusser's theory of ideology remains influential since it was written.

==Reproduction of the relations of production==
Althusser begins the essay by reiterating the Marxist theory that in order to exist, a social formation is required to essentially, continuously and perpetually reproduce the productive forces ([[Labour power]]), the conditions of production and the [[relations of production]]. The reproduction of production relations is ensured by the wage system which pays a minimum amount to the workers so that they appear to work day after day, thereby limiting their vertical mobility.&lt;ref name="leitch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leitch |first=Vincent B. |title=The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton and Company |year=2001 |pages=1483–1496}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1483–1484}} The reproduction of the conditions of production and the reproduction of the relations of production happens through the state apparatuses which are insidious machinations controlled by the capitalist ruling ideology in the context of a class struggle to repress, exploit, extort and subjugate the ruled class.&lt;ref name="leitch"/&gt;{{rp|1488–1490}}

The Marxist spatial metaphor of the edifice describes a social formation constituted by the foundational infrastructure, i.e. the economic base, on which stands the [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] consisting of two floors: the law/the state (the politico-legal floor) and ideology. A detailed description of both structures is provided below:

The infrastructure consists of the forces, the means, and the relations of production. The following examples reflect the concept of the infrastructure in further detail: 
# The forces included the workers. Also, it consists of the technical knowledge to perform the work, such as training and knowledge.
# The means are the materials of production. This includes the raw materials, tools, and machines.
# The relations of production reflect the interactions between workers as well as between the workers and owners
The superstructure arises from the infrastructure and consists of culture and ideology. The following examples reflect the concept of the superstructure in further detail:
# The culture includes the laws, politics, art, etc.
# Ideology includes the world views, values, and beliefs
Marx's theory is that the superstructure comes from the infrastructure and reconditions ways of life and living so that the infrastructure continues to be produced.

Althusser extends this topographical paradigm by stating that the infrastructural economic base is endowed with an "index of effectivity" which enables it to ultimately determine the functioning of the superstructure. He scrutinizes this structural metaphor by discussing the superstructure in detail. A close study of the superstructure is necessitated due to its relative autonomy over the base and its reciprocal action on the base.&lt;ref name="leitch" /&gt;{{rp|1486}}

==Repressive state apparatuses&lt;!--'[[Repressive state apparatus]]', '[[Repressive State Apparatus]]', '[[Repressive state apparatuses]]', '[[Repressive State Apparatuses]]' redirect here--&gt;==
The ruling class uses the '''repressive state apparatuses'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''RSA''') to dominate the working class. The basic, social function of the RSA (government, courts, police and armed forces, etc.) is timely intervention to politics in favour of the interests of the ruling class, by repressing the subordinate social classes as required, either by violent or non-violent coercive means. The ruling class controls the RSA, because they also control the powers of the state (political, legislative, armed).&lt;ref name="leitch"/&gt;{{rp|1491–1492}}
	
Althusser has enhanced the Marxist theory of the state, by distinguishing the repressive apparatuses of the state from the ideological apparatuses of the state (ISA), which are an array of social institutions and multiple, political realities that propagate many ideologies — the religious ISA, the educational ISA, the family ISA, the legal ISA, the political ISA, the communications ISA, the cultural ISA, etc.

The differences between the RSA and the ISA are: 
 	
:1. The repressive state apparatus (RSA) functions as a unified entity (an institution), unlike the ideological state apparatus (ISA), which is diverse in nature and plural in function. What unites the disparate ISA however is their ultimate control by the ruling ideology.
 	
:2. The apparatuses of the state, repressive and ideological, each perform the double functions of violence and ideology. A state apparatus cannot be exclusively repressive or exclusively ideological. The distinction between an RSA and an ISA is its primary function in society, respectively, the administration of violent repression and the dissemination of ideology. In practice, the RSA is the means of repression and violence, and, secondarily, a means of ideology; whereas, the primary, practical function of the ISA is as the means for the dissemination of ideology, and, secondarily, as a means of political violence and repression. The secondary functions of the ISA are affected in a concealed and a symbolic manner.&lt;ref name="leitch"/&gt;{{rp|1488–1491}}

Moreover, when individual persons and political groups threaten the social order established by the dominant social class, the state invokes the stabilising functions of the repressive state apparatus. As such, the benign forms of social repression affect the judicial system, where ostensibly public contractual language is invoked in order to govern individual and collective behaviour in society. As internal threats (social, political, economic) to the dominant order appear, the state applies the proportionate social repression: police suppression, incarceration, and, military intervention.

==Ideological state apparatuses&lt;!--'Ideological state apparatus', 'Ideological State Apparatus', 'Ideological state apparatuses', 'Ideological State Apparatuses' redirect here--&gt;==

'''Ideological state apparatuses''' (ISA), according to Althusser, use methods other than physical violence to achieve the same objectives as RSA. They may include educational institutions (e.g. schools), media outlets, churches, social/sports clubs and the family.  These formations are ostensibly apolitical and part of [[civil society]], rather than a ''formal'' part of the state (i.e. as is the case in RSA). In terms of psychology they could be described as [[psychosocial]], because they aim to inculcate ways of seeing and evaluating things, events and class relations. Instead of expressing and imposing order, through violent repression, ISA disseminate ideologies that reinforce the control of a [[Ruling class|dominant class]]. People tend to be co-opted by fear of [[social rejection]], e.g. ostracisation, ridicule and isolation. In Althusser's view, a social class cannot hold state power unless, and until, it simultaneously exercises [[Cultural hegemony|hegemony]] (domination) over and through ISA.

Educational ISA, in particular, assume a dominant role in a capitalist economy, and conceal and mask the ideology of the ruling class behind the "liberating qualities" of education, so that the hidden agendas of the ruling class are inconspicuous to most teachers, students, parents and other interested members of society.&lt;ref name="leitch"/&gt;{{rp|1493–1496}} Althusser said that the school has supplanted the church as the crucial ISA for indoctrination, which augments the reproduction of the relations of production (i.e. the capitalist relations of exploitation) by training the students to become a source of [[labour power]], who work for and under capitalists.

However, because ISA cannot dominate as obviously or readily as RSA, ideological state apparatuses may themselves become a site of [[class struggle]]. That is, subordinate social classes are able to find the means and occasions to express class struggle politically and in so doing counter the dominant class, either by utilizing ideological contradictions inherent in ISA, or by campaigns to take control of positions within the ISA.&lt;ref name="leitch"/&gt;{{rp|1491}} This, nevertheless, will not in itself prevent the dominant class from retaining its position in control of RSA.

==Two theses on ideology==
Althusser advances two theses on ideology: "Ideology represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence";&lt;ref name="althusser"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Louis |last=Althusser |authorlink=Louis Althusser |title=Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses |encyclopedia=Lenin and Philosophy and other Essays |year=1971 |pages=121–176 |isbn=0-902308-89-0  |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm}} Translated from the French by Ben Brewster.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|153}} and "Ideology has a material existence".&lt;ref name="althusser"/&gt;{{rp|155}} The first thesis tenders the familiar Marxist contention that ideologies have the function of masking the exploitative arrangements on which class societies are based.&lt;!--- more to be added ---&gt;

The second thesis posits that ideology does not exist in the form of "ideas" or conscious "representations" in the "minds" of individuals. Rather, ideology consists of the actions and behaviours of bodies governed by their disposition within material apparatuses. Central to the view of individuals as responsible subjects is the notion of an explanatory link between belief and action, that

{{quote|every 'subject' endowed with a 'consciousness' and believing in the 'ideas' that his 'consciousness' inspires in him and freely accepts, must ''act'' according to his ideas, must therefore inscribe his own ideas as a free subject in the actions of his material practice.&lt;ref name="althusser"/&gt;{{rp|157}}}}

For Althusser, this is yet another effect of social practice:

{{quote|I shall therefore say that, where only a single subject (such and such individual) is concerned, the existence of the ideas of his belief is material in that ''his ideas are his material actions inserted into his material practices governed by material rituals which are themselves defined by the material ideological apparatus from which we derive the ideas of that subject''...Ideas have disappeared as such (insofar as they are endowed with an ideal or spiritual existence), to the precise extent that it has emerged that their existence is inscribed in the actions of practices governed by rituals defined in the last instance by an ideological apparatus. It therefore appears that the subject acts insofar as he is acted by the following system (set out in the order of its real determination): ideology existing in a material ideological apparatus, describing material practices governed by a material ritual, which practices exist in the material actions of a subject acting in all consciousness according to his belief.''&lt;ref name="althusser"/&gt;{{rp|158–159}}}}

==Interpellation==
{{Main|Interpellation (philosophy)}}
According to Althusser, the obviousness that people (you and I) are subjects is an effect of ideology. Althusser believes that there are two functions of interpellation. One function of ideology is “recognition” and the other function, its inverse, is “misrecognition”. Below are a few concrete illustrations that Althusser provides to further explain the two functions:
# When a friend of yours knocks on your door, you ask “Who’s there?” The answer, since it is obvious, is “ it’s me”.  Once you recognize that “it is him or her”, you open to the door. After opening the door, you see that it truly is he or she who is there.
# Another illustration reflects Althusser’s idea of reconnaissance. When recognizing a familiar face on the street in France, for example, you show him that you have recognized him and that he has recognized you by saying “Hello, my friend”. You also shake his hand when speaking. The hand-shake represents a material ritual practice of ideological recognition in every-day life of France. Other locations across the world may have different rituals.
Althusser uses the term "interpellation" to describe the process by which ideology constitutes individual persons as subjects. The ideological social and political institutions — the family, the media, religious organisations, the education system and the discourses they propagate — 'hail' the individual in social interactions, giving the individual his or her identity. Althusser compares ideology to a policeman shouting "hey you" to a person walking in the street. The person responds to the call and in doing so is transformed into a [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] — a self-conscious, responsible agent whose actions can be explained by his or her thoughts. Althusser thus goes against the classical definition of the subject as cause and substance, emphasising instead how the situation always precedes the (individual or collective) subject. Concrete individual persons are the carriers of ideology — they are "[[always already|always-already]] interpellated" as subjects. Individual subjects are presented principally as produced by social forces, rather than acting as powerful independent agents with self-produced identities. Althusser's argument here strongly draws from Jacques Lacan's concept of the mirror stage&lt;ref name="althusser" /&gt;{{rp|162}} — we acquire our identities by seeing ourselves somehow mirrored in ideologies.

As a further example, Althusser depicts [[Christian]] religious ideology, embodied in the Voice of [[God]], instructing a person on what his place in the world is and what he must do to be reconciled with [[Christ]].&lt;ref name="althusser"/&gt;{{rp|166}} Althusser draws the point that in order for that person to identify himself as a Christian, he must first already be a subject; that is, by responding to God's call and following His rules, he affirms himself as a free agent, the author of the acts for which he assumes responsibility.&lt;ref name="althusser"/&gt;{{rp|169}} We cannot recognize ourselves outside of ideology, and in fact, our very actions reach out to this overarching structure.&lt;ref name="althusser"/&gt;{{rp|168}}

==Reception==
In his essay “Considerations on Western Marxism” (1976), [[Perry Anderson]] said that:

{{quote|Despite the huge popularity gained by the concept [of ideological state apparatus] in many circles, ISA, as a concept, was never theorised by Althusser, himself, in any serious manner. It was merely conceived as a conjunctural and temporary tool to challenge the contemporary liberalism within the French Communist Party. A further elaboration of the concept, in the hands of Nicos Poulantzas, was easily demolished by Ralph Miliband in the [[Miliband–Poulantzas debate|exchanges]] over the pages of ''New Left Review''. For, if all the institutions of civil society are conceptualised as part of the State, then a mere electoral victory of a left-wing student organisation, in a University, can also be said to be a victory over a part of the State!"{{Citation needed|reason=Page number. ''In the Tracks of Historical Materialism'', etc.|date=March 2011}}}}

Generally, Althusser’s perspectives on ideology remain respected; in the ''Louis Althusser'' capsule biography, the ''Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 2nd. Ed., says that “Althusser’s major concepts — Ideological State Apparatuses, Interpellation, Imaginary relations, and Overdetermination — permeate the discourse of contemporary literary and cultural theory, and his theory of ideology has influenced virtually all subsequent serious work on the topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism, 2nd Ed.|publisher=W.W. Norton and Co|page=1333|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In the Heat of the Night''''' is a 1967 American [[Mystery film|mystery]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Norman Jewison]]. It is based on [[John Ball (American author)|John Ball]]'s 1965 [[In the Heat of the Night (novel)|novel of the same name]] and tells the story of [[Virgil Tibbs]], a black [[police detective]] from [[Philadelphia]], who becomes involved in a murder investigation in a small town in [[Mississippi]]. It stars [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Rod Steiger]], and was produced by [[Walter Mirisch]]. The screenplay was by [[Stirling Silliphant]].

The film won five [[Academy Awards]], including the [[40th Academy Awards|1967]] awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and Rod Steiger for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].

The film was followed by two [[sequel]]s, ''[[They Call Me Mister Tibbs!]]'' in 1970, and ''[[The Organization (film)|The Organization]]'' in 1971. In 1988, it also became the basis of a [[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|television series]] adaptation of the same name.

Although the film was set in the fictional Mississippi town of Sparta (with supposedly no connection to the real [[Sparta, Mississippi]]), most of the movie was filmed in [[Sparta, Illinois]], where many of the film's landmarks can still be seen. The quote "They call me ''Mister Tibbs!''{{-"}} was listed as number 16 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]'', a list of top film quotes. In 2002, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
In 1966, a wealthy industrialist named Phillip Colbert has moved from [[Chicago]] to [[Sparta, Mississippi]] to build a factory. One night, police officer Sam Wood discovers that Colbert has been murdered.

Chief Gillespie leads the investigation. A doctor estimates that Colbert had been dead for a few hours. Wood finds a black man named [[Virgil Tibbs]] at the train station and arrests him. Gillespie quickly assumes that Tibbs is the culprit and tries to get Tibbs to make a confession. However, he is embarrassed to learn that Tibbs is a top homicide detective from [[Philadelphia]]. Gillespie phones Tibbs' chief, who confirms this and recommends that Tibbs should assist them. This idea does not appeal to Gillespie or Tibbs, but they reluctantly agree.

Gillespie arrests another suspect, but Tibbs clears him. The victim's widow is frustrated by the ineptitude of the local police and impressed by Tibbs. She threatens to stop the construction of the factory unless Tibbs leads the investigation. Despite the rocky start, the two policemen begin to respect each other as they are forced to work together.

Tibbs initially suspects plantation owner Endicott, a racist who publicly opposes the new factory. When Tibbs attempts to interrogate Endicott, Endicott slaps him in the face and Tibbs slaps him back. Endicott sends a gang of hooligans after Tibbs. Gillespie rescues him from the fight and tells him to leave town for his safety, but Tibbs is convinced he can solve the case. He examines Colbert's body and suggests the murder happened earlier than initially thought. He examines Colbert's car and deduces that Colbert was murdered elsewhere and the culprit moved the body. Tibbs asks Wood to retrace his car patrol route on the night of the murder, and Gillespie joins them. When Tibbs notices that Wood has changed his route, Gillespie starts suspecting Wood, though Tibbs hints there is another reason.

Gillespie discovers that Wood made a sizable deposit into his bank account the day after the murder while Purdy, a local, files charges against Wood for getting his 16-year-old sister Delores pregnant. Gillespie arrests Wood, despite Tibbs' protests, and Delores is interrogated. Purdy is offended that a black man was present at the interrogation, and he gathers a mob to get revenge. Tibbs reveals that the murder was committed at the site of the planned factory and clears Wood. He also admits that he knew why Wood had changed his route: Delores is an [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]] and Wood has been spying on her.

Tibbs visits a [[backstreet abortion]]ist, who reveals that someone paid for Delores to have an abortion. When Delores arrives, Tibbs follows her outside and is confronted by the murderer, Ralph. Purdy's mob tracks down Tibbs and holds him at gunpoint; he responds by proving that Ralph got Delores pregnant. Ralph shoots Purdy dead before Tibbs disarms him. Ralph is arrested and confesses to Colbert's murder: he robbed Colbert to fund Delores's abortion but accidentally killed him.

The final scene shows Tibbs boarding a train bound for Philadelphia, as Gillespie respectfully bids him farewell.

==Production==
Jewison, Poitier, and Steiger worked together and got along well during the filming, but Jewison had problems with the Southern authorities, and Poitier had reservations about coming south of the [[Mason–Dixon Line]] for filming. However, despite their reservations, Jewison decided to film part of the film in [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]] and [[Union City, Tennessee|Union City]], Tennessee, anyway while the rest was filmed in Sparta, [[Chester, Illinois|Chester]] (Harvey Oberst chase scene), and [[Freeburg, Illinois|Freeburg]] (Compton's diner), Illinois.

The famous scene of Tibbs slapping Endicott is not present in the novel. According to Poitier, the scene was almost not in the movie. In the textbook "Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to History)," Poitier states: "I said, 'I'll tell you what, I'll make this movie for you if you give me your absolute guarantee when he slaps me I slap him right back and you guarantee that it will play in every version of this movie.' I try not to do things that are against nature." &lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to History), Vivienne Sanders, Hodder Education, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, Poitier's version of the story is contradicted by [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] in his book, ''Pictures at a Revolution''. Harris states that copies of the original draft of the screenplay that he obtained clearly contain the scene as filmed, which is backed up by Jewison and Silliphant.

The film is also important for being the first major Hollywood film in color that was lit with proper consideration for a black person. [[Haskell Wexler]] recognized that standard strong lighting used in filming tended to produce too much glare on dark complexions and rendered the features indistinct. Accordingly, Wexler toned it down to feature Poitier with better photographic results.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Mark. ''Pictures at a Revolution: Five Films and the Birth of a New Hollywood''. Penguin Press, 2008, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In contrast to films like ''[[The Chase (1966 film)|The Chase]]'' and ''[[Hurry Sundown (film)|Hurry Sundown]]'', which offered confused visions of the South, ''In the Heat of the Night'' offered a tough, edgy vision of a Southern town that seemed to hate outsiders more than itself, a theme reflecting the uncertain mood of the time as the [[Civil Rights Movement]] attempted to take hold. Canadian director Jewison wanted to tell an anti-racist story of a white man and a black man working together in spite of difficulties. Jewison said that this film proved a conviction he had held for a long time: "It's you against the world. It's like going to war. Everybody is trying to tell you something different and they are always putting obstacles in your way."

In one famous scene, Gillespie mocks the name 'Virgil' by saying "That's a funny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia! What do they call you up there?" An irritated Tibbs replies: "They call me Mr. Tibbs!" The line was later listed as number 16 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]'', a list of top film quotes, and was also the title of [[They Call Me Mister Tibbs!|the sequel]]. An iconic scene that surprised and perhaps shocked audiences at the time occurs when Tibbs is slapped by Endicott. Tibbs responds by slapping him back.

In a [[San Francisco]] pre-screening, Jewison was concerned when the young audience was laughing at the film as if it were a comedy. The audience's stunned reaction to the slapping scene convinced Jewison that the film was effective as drama.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pp. 288–90.&lt;/ref&gt; That scene helped make the film so popular for audiences, finally seeing the top black film actor physically strike back against bigotry, that the film earned the nickname, ''[[Superspade|Super-spade]] Versus the Rednecks''.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the film's initial run, Steiger and Poitier occasionally went to the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]] in [[New York City|New York]] to amuse themselves seeing how many black and white audience members there were, which could be immediately ascertained by listening to the former cheering Tibbs's retaliatory slap and the latter whispering "Oh!" in astonishment.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pp. 335–6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
Then-freshman critic [[Roger Ebert]] in 1967 gave ''In the Heat of the Night'' a positive review and placed it at number ten on his top ten list of 1967 films.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130707145722/http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/eberts-10-best-lists-1967-present Ebert's 10 Best Lists: 1967 to Present.] [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'' via the [[Internet Archive]].

Retrieved October 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; AD Murphy of ''[[Variety magazine]]'' felt it was a good but uneven film.&lt;ref&gt;Later, Poitier did the sequels ''[[They Call Me MISTER Tibbs]]'' and ''[[The Organization (film)|The Organization]]'', but both films failed at the box office.[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117488059 ''Variety'' review, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film currently holds a 96% "Certified Fresh" rating on the [[Review aggregator|review aggregate]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], out of 46 reviews collected with an average rating of 8.2/10. Its consensus states, "Tense, funny, and thought-provoking all at once, and lifted by strong performances from Sydney Poitier and Rod Steiger, director Norman Jewison's look at murder and racism in small-town America continues to resonate today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_heat_of_the_night/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=In the Heat of the Night, Movie Reviews |accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allmusic]]'s Steven McDonald said the soundtrack had "a tone of righteous fury woven throughout" and that "the intent behind ''In the Heat of the Night'' was to get a Southern, blues-inflected atmosphere to support the angry, anti-racist approach of the picture .. although the cues from ''In the Heat of the Night'' show their age".&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;{{Allmusic|first=Steven|last=McDonald|class=album|id=mw0000034374|title=''In the Heat of the Night/They Call Me Mr. Tibbs'' – Review|accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Vinyl Factory]] said "this soundtrack to a film about racism in the South has a cool, decidedly Southern-fried sound with funk-bottomed bluesy touches, like on the strutting 'Cotton Curtain', the down 'n' dirty 'Whipping Boy' or the fat 'n' sassy 'Chief's Drive to Mayor'".&lt;ref&gt;[https://thevinylfactory.com/features/10-definitive-quincy-jones-soundtracks-from-the-60s-and-70s/ 10 definitive Quincy Jones soundtracks from the '60s and '70s], The Vinyl Factory, accessed January 19, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''[[Steven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV]]'' (1972–73 edition) gives ''In the Heat of the Night'' its highest rating of 4 stars, recommending it as an "[E]xciting, superbly acted and directed film about prejudice, manners and morals in a small Mississippi town", with the concluding sentences stating, "[D]irector Norman Jewison does an outstanding job in creating the subsurface tension of life in a 'sleepy' Southern town, and the supporting performances are uniformly fine. A first-rate film in all respects." ''[[Leonard Maltin's TV Movies &amp; Video Guide]]'' (1989 edition) follows Scheuer's example with its own highest rating of 4 stars, concluding that "[M]arvelous social thriller hasn't dated one bit—tough, funny, and atmospheric, with unbeatable acting and splendid Quincy Jones score. Five Oscars include Best Picture..."

''Mick Martin's &amp; Marsha Porter's DVD &amp; Video Guide'' (2007 edition) also puts its rating high, at 4 stars (out of 5), finding it "[A] rousing murder mystery elevated by the excellent acting of Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier."

British references likewise show high regard for the film, with [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]] in his 1984 ''The Good Film and Video Guide'' giving 3 (out of 4) stars, noting that "[A]s mystery or detective story this film is only fair but it has enormous tension. Within its given framework, it is good on the colour question. There is tension in the eyes of the black (Sidney Poitier), who happens to be a homicide officer, and malevolence in those of the local police chief (Rod Steiger). These are two remarkable performances, well supported by Warren Oates, Lee Grant and Larry Gates."

Another British film critic with a highly personal ''Film Guide'', [[Leslie Halliwell]], gave 2 stars (out of 4) describing it in the 5th edition (1985) as an "[O]verrated policier in which the personality clash is amusing (and was timely) but the murder puzzle is a complete throwaway." The ''Guide'' continued to be published after Halliwell's death in 1989 and, in the 21st edition, ''Halliwell's Film Video &amp; DVD Guide 2007'', John Walker, who took over as the ''Guide's'' author, raised the rating to the highest level of 4 stars and rewrote the evaluation to state that it is "[A] tense and exciting thriller that also explores racism through the explosive clash of two contrasting personalities."

==Home media==
''In the Heat of the Night'' was first released on [[DVD]] in 2001. In 2010, the film was digitized in High Definition (1080i) and broadcast on [[MGM HD]].

In 2014, MGM released the film on Blu-ray.

'''''Joe Cinque’s Consolation: A True Story of Death, Grief and the Law''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written by Australian [[author]] [[Helen Garner]], and published in 2004. It is an account of Garner's presence at the separate trials of [[Death of Joe Cinque#Anu_Singh|Anu Singh]] and her friend Madhavi Rao, who were accused of [[Death of Joe Cinque|murdering Singh's boyfriend Joe Cinque]] and Garner's attempts to understand the preceding events that led to his death as well as the legal and personal responses to the crime. The book was adapted into a 2016 [[Joe Cinque's Consolation (film)|film of the same name]].

A national bestseller, the book has sold 100,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/truly-helen/news-story/b78356cab63e9b5752d2cb89970f51a7|title=Truly Helen|date=29 March 2008|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joe Cinque's death ==

{{main article|Death of Joe Cinque}}

Anu Singh, a law student at Canberra's [[Australian National University]], killed her boyfriend Joe Cinque on 26 October 1997 with a lethal dose of heroin after she laced his coffee with [[Rohypnol]]. A number of her friends and acquaintances had been informed of her intent to kill him and some were present at parties she held in which he was drugged; none of these friends alerted authorities or police. She was subsequently found guilty of his [[manslaughter]]. The most involved of the friends, Madhavi Rao, was acquitted of all charges. Rao moved abroad and adopted a new identity after the conclusion of the trials, while Singh was released from prison in 2001.

== Summary ==

''Joe Cinque's Consolation'' begins with Garner being informed of Singh's second 1999 trial and its circumstances, when it was already in progress. She becomes interested and travels from her [[Sydney]] residence to attend the hearings in [[Canberra]]. She relates her impressions of the trial, including her negative reactions to Singh and her mystification at Rao's and others' lack of shock at and complicity in Singh's plans, which she determines to be a state of [[apathy]] and abandonment of compassion. As the trial progresses she becomes acquainted with Cinque's mother Maria and feels that the court system is not distributing sufficient justice to the victim or his family. 

After the trial Garner interviews Singh's family and attempts to interview Singh and Rao, but both refuse or are uncontactable. Because of Singh's refusal to be interviewed or contacted, Garner bases most of her information about the woman from erstwhile friends, anecdotal evidence and court transcripts. Singh is portrayed as somewhat [[Narcissism|narcissistic]], with significant self-esteem issues. Additionally, Garner notes the accused kept diaries about her interactions with men as a teen in which she treated them as disposable commodities, wore high heels to high school, and according to anecdotal evidence from her former best friend, treated Cinque with an element of derision&amp;ndash;sometimes mocking him and making jibes about what she thought was a lack of intellect to her friends. Many of Singh's former friends thought her to be shallow and self-obsessed. 

As the book progresses, Garner becomes interested in [[Victims' rights group|victim's rights]], interviews the presiding judge and repeatedly visits and becomes a friend of Cinque's family, and eventually concludes that the purpose of the book is to be consolation for Joe Cinque, as the trial proceedings could not be. 

===Themes===
Garner uses the case to explore far-reaching themes of human behaviour, culpability and responsibility, [[duty of care]], [[victims' rights]] and crime/punishment. She also touches on issues that range from the nature of human memory, including how it is not explicitly clear or cohesive, nor is it linear, and thus under cross-examination in a courtroom, any kind of lapse in memory, or contradiction of a preceding statement, may portray a person as a liar or an unworthy witness. 

Class and cultural clashes are drawn between the working class Italian-Australian family of the Cinques, compared to the "professional class" Indian-Australian family of the Singhs. That comparison starkly juxtaposes the [[blue-collar]] or [[working class]] Cinques (although Joe Cinque had a degree in engineering) with the [[middle class]] status of the Singhs. 

Furthermore, the use of [[psychiatry]] in law, is alluded to various times. Garner questions whether a "psychological sophistication" that has developed in light of modern [[behavioural science]] overrides the fact that some actions are plainly wrong and should be punishable, regardless of the [[mental illness|pathology]] of the person who commits them. She poses [[culpability|this question]] in reference to Anu Singh. Singh's defence team used her "abnormality of mind" (a diagnosis of [[borderline personality disorder]] and psychotic depression was referenced in the court proceedings) as an explanation for her killing Cinque, akin to the [[insanity defense]]. 

Finally, Garner laments on the perfunctory decision that the Crown psychiatrist would not be given direct access to Singh, and her diagnosis would be made instead on the basis of transcripts and interviews with [[mental health]] professionals in the past – Garner admits this "floored" her. Additionally, one reviewer writing for the ''Australian Book Review'' opined that it was Maria Cinque who called out the "flaky [[moral relativism]]" of the ANU students who were indifferent to Singh's plans, as well as the Canberra courts, the defence lawyers and the judge who handled the case.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Rose reviews 'Joe Cinque's Consolation' by Helen Garner|date=September 2004|accessdate=30 August 2017|url=https://www.australianbookreview.com.au/abr-online/archive/2004/september/2209-joe-cinque-s-consolation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complicity of the students, and whether or not they played a role in Cinque's death by not alerting authorities, was also a topic debated extensively throughout the text.

''Joe Cinque's Consolation'' was reviewed in a number of major newspapers and magazines. It was praised for its writing&lt;ref name="dever"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dever | first =Maryanne |date=February 2004  | title =  Hanging Out for Judgement? | journal = Hecate's Australian Women's Book Review | url = http://www.emsah.uq.edu.au/awsr/awbr/issues/138/dever.html | accessdate = 2008-05-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080723085551/http://emsah.uq.edu.au/awsr/awbr/issues/138/dever.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its positioning as Joe Cinque's story.&lt;ref name="fraser"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fraser|first=Morgan|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/11/1092102517082.html|title=Joe Cinque's Consolation|date=14 August 2004|accessdate=2008-05-24|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of the book centered on it failing to tell the story it set out to tell, particularly its inability to explain Singh or her actions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hewitson|first=Michelle|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/6/story.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10365872|title=Helen Garner: Joe Cinque's Consolation|date=30 January 2006|accessdate=2008-05-24|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fitzgerald|first=Michael|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,679925,00.html|title=Everything But the Truth|date=11 August 2004|accessdate=2008-05-24|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her failure to engage with the purpose of the adversarial justice system.&lt;ref name="dever"/&gt; Some saw this as a deliberate attempt by Garner as an author angle she chose to pursue&amp;ndash;to honour Cinque, whose family had been not given a voice or adequate justice by the court. In his review for the ''[[Australian Book Review]]'', [[Peter Rose (poet)|Peter Rose]] remarked that "books such as Joe Cinque’s Consolation often dignify the parents’ agony and indignation. In Maria Cinque we have one of the great stalwarts in this literature of loss. She is always there in court – listening, occasionally hissing and weeping, raging when she must. ‘They were keeping vigil,’ Garner says, marvelling at the Cinques’ stamina. Which is what Garner becomes conscious of doing." He further commented on the book being Garner's conscious testament to the injustice dealt to Joe Cinque and his family: "For what are these books but tributes to the dead, swipes at our forgetfulness, minor consolations for the living: the parents and siblings and friends who feel devastated and betrayed? One thinks of all the unattested lives, the little murders".&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt;

Elisabeth Hanscombe, writing for Academia, wrote that Garner's writing, and her depiction of Anu Singh, addressed the notion that for a layperson it "may perhaps be difficult to understand that someone can be extremely intelligent, can function well academically, be beautiful and at the same time be seriously disturbed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helen Garner and the desire for revenge|url=https://www.academia.edu/10881969/Helen_Garner_and_the_desire_for_revenge|first=Elisabeth|last=Hanscombe|work=Academia|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reviewer compared it with ''[[The First Stone]]'' (1995), noting that it was less about the underlying debates and more about the story.&lt;ref name="fraser"/&gt; Another, Maryanne Dever (writing for the ''Australian Women's Book Review'') criticised similarities in the themes of both books, particularly Garner's perceived hostility to the women subjects and their physical appearance.&lt;ref name="dever"/&gt;

The cover of the re-printed edition from 2006 contains a blurb extracted from a review in ''[[The Bulletin]]'', which reads: "A book which functions at one level as a psychological mystery, but at deeper levels is an exploration of the adequacy of the law to dispense justice, and the responsibility that human beings have to each other...It is told with compassion, a singular kind of honesty, and unadorned intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Joe Cinque's Consolation: A True Story of Death, Grief and the Law|work=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=D-ZcUL4_wH8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=joe+cinque%27s+consolation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=joe%20cinque's%20consolation&amp;f=false|page=front cover|publisher=Picador Australia|year=2004|isbn=9780330421782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media response ==

Both Singh herself and Cinque's parents gave interviews shortly after the book's release. Singh recounted her own memories of the killing and her feelings about it after her release and expressed regret at not agreeing to an interview by Garner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyndham|first=Susan|title=On death and madness|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/08/1091903447496.html|date=9 August 2004|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told interviewers that she wished to redress some of the book's imbalance towards her.&lt;ref name="latenightlive"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Joe Cinque is Dead |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2004/1205918.htm|credits=Anne Delaney (producer) and Phillip Adams (interviewer)|series=Late Night Live|serieslink=Late Night Live|network=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |station=[[Radio National]]|airdate=2004-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Maria Cinque said that she would never forgive Singh for killing her son and did not believe her defence against the murder charge.&lt;ref name="latenightlive"/&gt; Garner also stated that she still did not understand or empathise with Singh, although some aspects of her behaviour resonated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Garner on murder and the justice system |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1165020.htm |series=The 7:30 Report |serieslink=The 7:30 Report |credits=Kerry O'Brien (interviewer) |network=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |station=ABC  |airdate=2004-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jónína Leósdóttir''' (born 16 May 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://eng.forsaetisraduneyti.is/minister/cv |title=CV: Prime Minister of Iceland Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir |publisher=Prime Minister's Office |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] novelist, playwright, former journalist and [[Spouse of the Prime Minister of Iceland]] from 2008 until 2013.

She is the author of a dozen plays, eleven novels, two biographies and a collection of articles she originally wrote for a women's magazine. Her books have been translated into several languages.

She is married to the former Icelandic Prime Minister [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]], who was the first openly [[lesbian]] head of government in modern history.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1875032,00.html|title=

She has now written a book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3012448.J_n_na_Le_sd_ttir|title=Jónína Leósdóttir|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; about her relationship with the former prime minister.

She has a BA in English and Literature from the [[University of Iceland]].

{{wiktionary pipe|know-how}}
'''Know-how''' (or '''knowhow''') is a term for practical knowledge on how to accomplish something, as opposed to "know-what" (facts), "know-why" (science), or "know-who" (communication). Know-how is often [[tacit knowledge]], which means that it is difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalising it. Dubickis and Gaile-Sarkane (2017) states that the performance of know-how transfer is affected by accuracy of the stated aim, applied teaching, learning and assessment methods and both internal and external environment characteristics of the stakeholders involved in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Dubickis and Gaile-Sarkane (2017). Transfer of know-how based on learning
outcomes for development of open innovation. Retrieved from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313896176_Transfer_of_know-how_based_on_learning_outcomes_for_development_of_open_innovation&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of tacit knowledge is [[explicit knowledge]].

In the context of [[industrial property]] (now generally viewed as [[Intellectual Property Rights|intellectual property]] or IP), know-how is a component in the transfer of technology in national and international environments, co-existing with or separate from other IP rights such as [[patent]]s, [[trademark]]s and [[copyright]] and is an economic asset.&lt;ref&gt;Manual on Technology Transfer Negotiation, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (A Reference for Policy-makers and Practitioners on Technology Transfer), [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]], [[Vienna, Austria]] (1996) {{ISBN|92-1-106302-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is transferred by itself, know-how should be converted into a [[trade secret]] before transfer in a legal agreement.

==Definition of industrial know-how==
Know-how can be defined as ''confidentially held'', or better, "closely held" information in the form of unpatented inventions, formulae, designs, drawings, procedures and methods, together with accumulated skills and experience in the hands of a licensor firm's professional personnel which could assist a transferee/licensee of the object product in its manufacture and use and bring to it a competitive advantage. It can be further supported with privately maintained expert knowledge on the operation, maintenance, use/application of the object product and of its sale, usage or disposition.

The inherent proprietary value of know-how lies embedded in the legal protection afforded to [[trade secrets]] in general law, particularly, "case law".&lt;ref&gt;Licensing Guide for Developing Countries, [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), Geneva, 1977, {{ISBN|92-805-0395-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Know-how, in short, is "private intellectual property" which can be said to be a form of precursor to other intellectual property rights. The "trade secret law" varies from country to country, unlike the case for patents, trademarks and copyright for which there are formal "conventions" through which subscribing countries grant the same protection to the "property" as the others; examples of which are the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] and the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), under United Nations, a supportive organization designed "to encourage creative activity, [and] to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world".

A trade- secret may be defined as&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm3d_e.htm TRIPS Agreement (1995), Section 7, Article 39(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;
:#  it is secret meaning it is not, as a whole or in the way its parts are arranged, known by or readily accessible to people in the field that would normally deal with that information
:# it is commercially valuable because it is secret
:# reasonable effort has been made to keep it secret
For purposes of illustration, the following may be a provision in a [[license agreement]] serving to define know-how:

:&lt;small&gt;'''Know-how shall  mean technical data, formulae, standards, technical information,  specifications, processes, methods, code  books, raw materials, as well as all information, knowledge, assistance, trade practices and secrets, and improvements thereto,  divulged, disclosed,  or in any way communicated to the Licensee under  this  Agreement, unless such information was, at the time of disclosure,  or thereafter  becomes part of the general knowledge  or  literature which  is  generally available for public use from  other  lawful sources. The burden of proving that any  information  disclosed hereunder is not confidential information shall rest on the licensee'''.&lt;/small&gt;

==Show-how==
'''Show-how''' is a diluted form of know-how since even a walk-through of a manufacturing plant provides valuable insights to the client's representatives into how a product is made, assembled, or processed. Show-how is also used to demonstrate technique. {{citation needed|date=September 2008}}

An enlarged program of show-how is the typical content of '''Technical Assistance Agreements''' where the licensor firm, if one is involved, provides a substantial training program to the client's personnel on-site and off-site. (Note: Such training does not imply any grant of "license".) {{citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Disclosure agreements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}
There are two sets of agreements associated with the transfer of know-how agreement: (a) the disclosure and (b) the non-disclosure agreements, which are not separately parts of the principal know-how agreement. {{citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The initial need for "disclosure" is due to the requirement of a licensee firm to know what is the specific, unique, or general "content" of the know-how that a licensor firm possesses that promises value to the licensee on entering into a contract. Disclosure also aids the potential licensee in selecting among competitive offers, if any. Such disclosures are made by licensors only under non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements in which there are express undertakings that should the ultimate license not materialize, the firm to whom the disclosure is made will not reveal - and equally important - by any manner apply, any part of the disclosed knowledge which is not in the public domain or previously known to the firm receiving the information.

Non-disclosure agreements are undertaken by those who receive confidential information from the ''licensee'', relating to licensed know-how, so as to perform their tasks. Among them are the personnel of engineering firms who construct the plant for the licensee or those who are key employees of the licensee who have detailed access to disclosed data, etc. to administer their functions in operating the know-how-based plant. These are also in the nature of confidentiality agreements and carry the definition of know-how, in full or truncated part, on a need-to-know basis.

==General know-how==
Outside usage in terms of industrial property, know-how is viewed as [[procedural knowledge]] (a term that also reveals its nature).

== Employee knowledge ==
Under English law, employees have a duty of [[good faith]] and fidelity until their employment ceases whereby only the former still applies. 

It is sometimes unclear what forms "know how" that was divulged to an employee in order to carry out their functions and then becomes their own knowledge rather than a secret of their previous employer. Some employers will specify in their employment contracts that a "[[grace period]]" will apply to know how that starts when a person leaves them as an employee. 

Specifying exactly what information this includes would increase the likelihood of it being upheld in court in the event of a breach, i.e. saying "when your employment contract is terminated, you must keep all information about your previous employment with us secret for 4 years" would be difficult to support because that person has to be able to use the skills and knowledge they learnt to gain employment elsewhere.

This is a '''list of house types'''. [[House]]s can be built in a large variety of configurations. A basic division is between free-standing or [[Single-family houses]] and various types of attached or [[Multi-family residential|multi-user dwellings]]. Both may vary greatly in scale and amount of accommodation provided. Although there appear to be many different types, many of the variations listed below are purely matters of [[design|style]] rather than spatial arrangement or scale. Some of the terms listed are only used in some parts of the [[English-speaking world]].

* '''[[Victorian house]]'''
* '''[[Villa]]''': originally an upper-class country house, though since its origins in [[Roman Republic|Roman]] times the idea and function of a villa has evolved considerably.
* '''[[Villa Palladiana]]''': a group of Venetian villas designed by Andrea Palladio in the 16th century. A.D.

The most important Palladian villas have been declared Unesco Heritage sites.
* '''[[Villa Veneta]]''': a heterogeneous set of luxurious residences set up in Veneto (Italy) by the rich families of the Republic of Venice between the 15th and the late 18th century AD. Some of these homes were real Royal Palaces. To date there are still fewer than 5,000 Venetian Villas. Some Venetian Villas have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Semi-detached dwellings ==
{{main|Semi-detached}}

* '''[[Council house]]''': in United Kingdom and Ireland. [[Social housing]] built by the local authority, normally part of a council estate, for rental to low-income families. See also [[Council flat]].
* '''[[Duplex house]]''': commonly refers to two separate [[House|residences]], attached side-by-side, but the term is sometimes used to mean stacked apartments on two different floors (particularly in urban areas such as New York and San Francisco). (See [[#Two decker|Two decker]]) The duplex house often looks like either two [[house]]s put together, or as a large single home, and both legally and structurally, literally shares a wall between halves. The duplex home can appear as a single townhouse section with two different entrances, though the occasional duplex with a shared common entrance and entry hall have been constructed. The jargon terms "triplex" and "four-plex" are contrived names that refer to similar structures with three or four housing units, or floors if referring to apartments, and again the characteristic sharing of [[Load-bearing wall|structural walls]], as are the [[#Townhouse|townhouse]] and [[six pack (house)|six pack]] forms that adapted the savings in materials and costs of a shared load bearing wall.
{{anchor|Two family home|two-family house}}
* '''Two-family home''' or '''two-family house''': the generic American [[real estate business]] jargon for a small apartment house or a [[duplex house]] that contain two dwelling units. In advertisements, "two-family home" is the generally used jargon.
* '''[[#Two decker|Two decker]]''' (a Double decker building plan): since real-estate advertising generally specifies correctly whether the two-family home is a [[duplex (building)|duplex-house type]] these are usually more desirable for both rentals or purchases.
* '''[[Semi-detached]]:''' two houses joined together; compare ''[[duplex (building)|duplex]]''.

== Attached single-unit housing ==
* '''[[Byre-dwelling]]''': farmhouse with people and livestock under one roof.
* '''[[Connected farm]]''': type of farmhouse common in New England.
* '''[[Housebarn]]''': combined house and barn, see article for many types.
* '''[[Longhouse]]''': historical house type typically for family groups or as a [[housebarn]].

== Attached multi-unit housing ==
{{main|Multi-family residential}}

Specific terms under various American federal, state, or local laws dealing with fair housing, truth in advertising, and so forth, have been prescribed and engender specific legal meanings. For example, in American housing codes, all "apartments" must contain a kitchen, bathing facilities, and a sleeping area, or else that term may '''''not''''' be used. This generates various differences within the English-speaking world, and the terms such as "single-family", "two-family", or "three-family" building, residence, house, home, or property can be generic and thus convey little or no building plan (style of building) information. Such terminology is most common in advertising and real-estate markets that offer leasing of such units, or sales of such buildings.

* '''[[Apartment]]:''' a relatively self-contained housing unit in a building which is often rented out to one person or a family, or two or more people sharing a lease in a partnership, for their exclusive use. Sometimes called a ''flat'' or ''digs'' (slang). Some locales have legal definitions of what constitutes an apartment. In some locations, "apartment" denotes a building that was built specifically for such units, whereas "flat" denotes a unit in a building that had been originally built as a single-family house, but later on subdivided into some multi-unit house type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apartmentchicagoweb.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012160800/http://apartmentchicagoweb.com/ |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Aul]]:''' a type of fortified village found throughout the [[Caucasus Mountains]], especially in [[Dagestan]].
* '''[[Barracks]]:''' a type of military housing, which used to connoting a large ''"open bay"'' with rows of bunk beds and attached [[bathroom]] facilities, but during the most recent several decades for the American [[U.S. Department of Defense|Armed Forces]] most of the new housing units for unmarried servicemen have been constructed with a dormitory-style layout housing two to four servicemembers.

* '''[[Brownstone]]:''' a [[New York City]] term for a rowhouse: see [[rowhouse]].

The standard type contains a kitchenette or basic cooking facilities in a combined bedroom/living area, with a separate bathroom and lavatory shared between a number of rooms. Once common in older Victorian properties in British cities, they are less frequently found since the 1980s as a result of tenancy reforms, property prices and renovation grants that favour the refurbishment of such properties into self-contained flats for leasehold sale.
* '''[[Choultry]]:''' a South-Indian Hindu-[[Caravanserai]]
* '''Close:''' Term used in Glasgow for high density [[slum]] housing built 1800-1870.

* '''[[Deck access]]''': a block of "flats" which are accessed from a walkway that is open to the elements.
* '''Flat:''' In Great Britain and Ireland, this means exactly the same as an "apartment". In and around [[San Francisco, CA]], this term means an apartment that takes up an entire floor of a large house, usually one that has been converted from an older [[Victorian architecture|Victorian house]].
* '''2-Flat''', '''3-Flat''', and '''4-Flat''' houses: houses or buildings with 2, 3, or 4 flats, respectively, especially when each of the flats takes up one entire floor of the house. There is a common stairway in the front and often in the back providing access to all the flats. 2-Flats and sometimes 3-flats are common in certain older neighborhoods.
* '''Four Plus One:''' an apartment building consisting of four stories above a parking lot. The four floors containing the apartment units are of wood-frame and masonry construction. It was particularly popular in [[Chicago]] during the 1960s and 1970s, especially on the city's north side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forgottenchicago.com/features/defining-the-four-plus-one/ |title=Defining the Four Plus One &amp;#124; Forgotten Chicago &amp;#124; History, Architecture, and Infrastructure |publisher=Forgotten Chicago |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Housing cooperative]]''' (or '''Co-op'''): a form of ownership in which a non-profit corporation owns the entire apartment building or development and residents own shares in the corporation that correspond to their apartment and a percentage of common areas. In Australia this corresponds with a "company title" apartment.
* '''Housing project:''' a North American term for government-owned housing for low-income tenants (aka '''[[Public housing]]''' or '''[[Social housing]]''').
* '''Live Work:''' a townhouse / row house having a retail, office or workshop on the ground floor with living premises of the building proprietor and occupier (the one person) of the ground floor commercial space above e.g. like the traditional high street Victorian grocer. Normally with fire rated separation.

* '''[[Loft]]''' or '''[[warehouse conversion]]''' can be an apartment building wherein part of the unit, usually consisting of the bedroom(s) and/or a second bedroom level bath is sub-divided vertically within the structurally tall bay between the structural floors of a former factory or warehouse building. The lofts created in such are locally supported by [[column]]s and [[bearing wall]]s and not part of the overall original load bearing structure.
* '''Maisonette:''' an apartment / flat on two levels with internal stairs, or which has its own entrance at street level.
* '''Mess:''' a building or flat with single bedroom per tenant and shared facilities like toilets and kitchens.

* '''[[Granny flat|Mother-in-law apartment]]:''' small apartment either at the back, in the basement, or on an upper level subdivision of the main house, usually with a separate entrance (also known as a "[[Granny flat]]" in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Australia]] [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]). If it is a separate structure from the main house, it is called a 'granny cottage' or a 'doddy house'. Such '''Secondary suites''' are often efficiency or two room apartments but always have kitchen facilities (which is usually a legal requirement of any apartment).
* '''[[Officetel]]:''' small apartment providing a combined work and living area in one place, especially in South Korea.
* '''[[Penthouse apartment|Penthouse]]:''' the top floor of multi-story building

* '''Q-type:''' [[townhouse]] built mainly in housing estates in the UK beginning in the late 20th century. The houses are arranged in blocks of four with each house at a corner of the block. Similar to the earlier '''cluster house''' (see above).
* '''[[Railroad apartment]]''' (or '''railroad flat'''): a type of apartment in which rooms are directly linked, without hallway separation, similar to a line of [[railroad cars]].
* '''[[Rooming house]]:''' a type of [[Single Room Occupancy]] building where most washing, kitchen and laundry facilities are shared between residents, which may also share a common suite of living rooms and dining room, with or without board arrangements. When board is provided (no longer common), a common dining time and schedule is imposed by the landlord who in such cases also serves as an [[innkeeper]] of sorts. In Australia and the United States, any housing accommodation with 4 or more bedrooms can be regarded as a rooming house if each bedroom is subject to individual tenancy agreements. In the U.S., rooming house lease agreements typically run for very short periods, usually week to week, or a few days at a time. Transient housing arrangements for longer term tenancies are implemented by a "rider" on a case by case basis, if local laws permit.
* '''[[Rowhouse]]''' (USA); also called "'''Terraced home'''" (USA); also called "'''Townhouse'''": 3 or more houses in a row sharing a "party" wall with its adjacent neighbour. In [[New York City]], "''[[Brownstone]]s''" are rowhouses. Rowhouses are typically multiple stories. The term townhouse is currently coming into wider use in the UK, but terraced house (not "terraced home") is more common.
* '''[[Shophouse]]:''' the name given in [[Southeast Asia]] to a terraced two to five story urban building featuring a shop or other public activity on the street level, with residential accommodation on upper floors.
* '''[[Single Room Occupancy]]''' or '''SRO:''' a studio apartment, usually occurring with a block of many similar apartments, intended for use as [[public housing]]. They may or may not have their own washing, laundry, and kitchen facilities. In the United States, lack of kitchen facilities prevents use of the term "apartment", so such would be classified as a [[boarding house]] or [[hotel]].
* '''Six-pack:''' in [[New England]] (USA), this refers to a [[stick-built]] block of 6 apartments comprising (duplexed) two three story [[#Triple decker|Triple decker]]s built side by side sharing one wall, a common roof, lot, yards (lawns and gardens, if any), parking arrangements, and basement, but possessing separately metered electric, and separate hot water and heating or air conditioning. In [[Australia]], it refers to a style of apartments that were constructed during the 1960s, 70s and early 80s, usually comprising a single, masonry-built block containing 4 to 8 walk-up apartments (though sometimes, many more), of between 2 and 3 stories in height, with car parking at the side or rear.

{{Anchor|Bachelor apartment}}
* '''[[Studio apartment]]''' or '''Studio flat''' (UK), or '''Bachelor apartment''' or '''Efficiency apartment:''' a suite with a single room that doubles as living/sitting room and bedroom, with a [[kitchenette]] and bath squeezed in off to one side. The unit is designed for a single occupant or possibly a couple. Especially in Canada and South Africa, also called ''bachelor'', or ''bachelorette'' if very small.
* '''Tenement:''' a multi-unit dwelling usually of frame construction, quite often brick veneered, made up of several (generally many more than four to six) apartments (i.e. a large apartment building) that can be up to five stories. Tenements do not generally have elevators. In the United States the connotation sometimes implies a run-down or poorly cared-for building. It often refers to a very large apartment building usually constructed during the late 19th to early 20th century era sited in cities or [[company town]]s.

[[Image:Terrace on Lloyd Street South in Moss Side, Manchester.jpg|thumb|250px|Example of late [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] terrace in [[Moss Side]], [[Manchester]], UK.]]

* '''[[Terraced house]]:''' since the late 18th century is a style of housing where (generally) identical individual houses are conjoined into rows - a line of houses which abut directly on to each other built with shared party walls between dwellings whose uniform fronts and uniform height created an ensemble that was more stylish than a "''rowhouse''". However this is also the UK term for a "rowhouse" regardless of whether the houses are identical or not.
** '''[[Back-to-back houses|Back-to-back]]:''' terraced houses which also adjoin a second terrace to the rear. They were a common form of housing for workers during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[England]].
* '''[[Tower block]]''' or '''Apartment tower''': a high-rise [[apartment building]].
* '''[[Townhouse]]:''' also called '''Rowhouse''' (US). In the UK, a townhouse is a traditional term for an upper class house in London (in contrast with [[country house]]), and is now coming into use as a term for new terraced houses, which are often three or more stories tall and may include a garage on the ground floor.
** '''Stacked townhouse:''' units are stacked on each other; units may be multilevel; all units have direct access from the outside.
{{Anchor|Three family home|Three family house}}
* '''Three family home''' or '''Three family house:''' U.S. real estate and advertising term for several configurations of apartment classed dwelling buildings including:
** '''[[Triple decker]]:''' a three-family apartment house, usually of frame construction, in which all three apartment units are stacked on top of one another. (For additional characteristics, also see [[#Multifamily home features|Multifamily home features]] below.)
** {{anchor|Two decker}} '''Two decker:''' a two family house consisting of stacked apartments that frequently have similar or identical floor plans. Some two deckers, usually ones starting as single-family homes, have one or both floors sub-divided and are therefore three or four-family dwellings. Some have external stairways giving a totally separate entrance, and some, usually those which have been a single-family house now sub-divided, are similar to the ''Maisonette'' plan but sharing a common external 'main entrance' door and lock, and a main internal hall with stairways letting to the separate apartments. (For additional characteristics, also see [[#Multifamily home features|Multifamily home features]] below.)
* '''[[Tyneside flat]]:''' a pair of single-storey flats in a two-storey terrace, distinctively with two separate front doors to the street rather than a shared lobby. Notably found on [[Tyneside]], North Eastern England.

The '''Louisville Ballet''' is a [[ballet]] school and company based in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and is the official state ballet of The Commonwealth of [[Kentucky]]. It is currently led by Artistic and Executive Director Robert Curran. More than 100,000 people attend the company's productions annually of which most are accompanied by the [[Louisville Orchestra]]. The company performs at three venues in the city, The Brown Theatre, [[The Kentucky Center]], and, rarely, [[The Louisville Palace]].

The Louisville Ballet was founded in 1952 and it achieved professional status and admitted its first students in 1975. It is the only regional company with which [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] has performed in repertoire productions (He danced with the company during the 1978–79 and 1979–80 seasons). The Ballet has more than 60 world premieres to its credit with a repertoire of about 150 pieces choreographed by the likes of [[Frederick Ashton|Sir Frederick Ashton]], [[Erik Bruhn]], [[George Balanchine]], [[Antony Tudor]], [[John Cranko]], [[Jack Carter (choreographer)|Jack Carter]], [[Kurt Jooss]], [[Gho Choo San|Choo San Goh]], [[José Limón|Jose Limon]], [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], David Parsons, Eugene Loring, Saeko Ichinohe and Domy Reiter-Soffer, along with Fokine and Bournonville ballets. The Ballet also presents several full length ballets each year including [[Swan Lake]], [[Sleeping Beauty|The Sleeping Beauty]], Coppelia, [[Romeo and Juliet]], Cinderella, Giselle and [[Don Quixote]]. In addition to the regular subscription series, the Louisville Ballet presents [[The Nutcracker]] each [[Winter holiday season|holiday season]] in association with the [[Brown-Forman Corporation]].

The Louisville Ballet building, designed by Louisville architects Bravura Corporation, is a $2.2 million facility built in 1995 houses two large rehearsal studios and administrative offices. The Louisville Ballet Center received the Honor Award for Excellence in Architectural Design by the Kentucky chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] and was featured in the May 1997 edition of Architecture Magazine. It is located at 315 East Main St. in [[downtown Louisville]].

The Louisville Ballet School is the official school and training center connected with the Louisville Ballet. The Louisville Ballet Youth Ensemble is the student performing group of the School. Alumni of the Ensemble have gone on to dance professionally with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Ailey II, American Ballet Theatre, Aspen Santa Fe Ballet, Ballet Magnificat!, Barcelona Ballet (formerly Corella Ballet), Boston Ballet II, Colorado Ballet, Ft. Wayne Ballet, Houston Ballet, Louisville Ballet, Missouri Ballet Theatre, New York City Ballet, Peridance and Sarasota Ballet, and those who have continued their dance education at NYU, Fordham (Ailey), Butler University, Florida State, University of Arizona, Ohio State University, Pointe Park University and Southern Methodist University. Many students also went on to study with professional training programs including Boston Ballet, Harid Conservatory, Next Generation Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, San Francisco Ballet and the [[School of American Ballet]]. The school also hosts a [[summer camp]] for aspiring dancers.

'''Mapback''' is a term used by [[paperback]] collectors to refer to the earliest paperback books published by [[Dell Books]], beginning in 1943.  The books are known as mapbacks because the back cover of the book contains a map that illustrates the location of the action.  Dell books were numbered in series.  Mapbacks extend from #5 to at least #550; then maps became less of a fixed feature of the books and disappeared entirely in 1951.  (Numbers 1 through 4 had no map, although a later re-publication of #4, ''[[The American Gun Mystery]]'' by [[Ellery Queen]], added a map.)  The occasional number in the series between #5 and #550 contains no map, but some sort of full-page graphic or text connected with the book's contents.  

The artwork of the maps began with quite detailed maps, and later numbers contain more stylized ones.  "The back cover map was very popular with readers and remains popular with collectors ... the Dell 'mapbacks' are among the most well known vintage paperbacks."&lt;ref&gt;Canja, Jeff (2002).  ''Collectable Paperback Books: A new vintage paperback price reference (Second edition)''.  East Lansing, MI: Glenmoor Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dell's most memorable design innovation was not on the front but on the back covers ... the entire back covers given over to maps, or variously charts, blueprints, or what have you to represent story locale or scene of the crime: a stretch of California highway, the interior of an apartment, a sheik's 'city of stones.'  It was an enjoyable if slightly goofy gimmick and, amazingly, managed to last nearly ten years."&lt;ref&gt;Server, Lee (1994).  ''Over My Dead Body: The Sensational Age of the American Paperback: 1945-1955''. San Francisco: Chronicle Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other features==
"Besides distinctive front covers and back-cover maps, Dell paperbacks also had a number of other interesting features, including an "eye-in-keyhole" logo, front-cover blurbs, character lists, lists of key items or events in the book ("tantalizer-pages"), crowded title pages, and special chapter titles."&lt;ref&gt;Lyles, William H (1983). ''Putting Dell on the Map: A History of the Dell Paperbacks''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publishers, including Dell, thoughtfully included brief lists of the main characters in their books -- especially in mysteries -- to allow readers to keep the characters straight.  In mapbacks, "Persons this Mystery is about" followed the inside flyleaf, and gave a short descriptive paragraph.  For instance, the protagonist of the mapback shown at right is described as follows:
:"'''Rogan Kincaid''', a gambler, tall, lean, enigmatic and attractive to women, believes there is a logical explanation for everything, but is ready to change his mind after witnessing some of the goings-on at Cabrioun, an isolated hunting lodge near the Canadian border."

The "tantalizer-pages" contained two features meant to entice the browsing reader.  "What this Mystery is about" gives a list of clues and events that are found within.  Those from ''[[Rim of the Pit]]'' include:
:"A dead man's VOICE floating on the wind across a lonely, frozen lake ... An encased ACCORDION playing a dead man's favorite song ... A SEANCE in an isolated lodge at which a medium is forced by her second husband to summon the spirit of her first husband ... A terrifying THING which seems to take possession of a man ... FOOTPRINTS which seem to begin nowhere; end nowhere ... A weird, flying, manlike CREATURE ... A SILVER BULLET molded by a half-crazed man ... Horrible MURDER, apparently unsolvable, of a supernatural origin."

And the enticing section, "Wouldn't you like to Know --"
* What made a Great Dane suddenly leap to his feet during the seance, growl and quiver in fear?
* Why the appearance of the hideous apparition caused such obvious terror in the medium?
* How a man escaped from a strongly barricaded room?
* What a windigo is?
* The significance of the words "net" and "emit" on the inside of an envelope?
* Why all the mirrors in the dead woman's room were smashed?

Of course, non-mysteries had somewhat less tantalizing clues and questions, but the same format was kept.  The "List of Exciting Chapters" featured chapter titles which were frequently added or changed by Dell editors.

==Types of mapbacks==
Mapbacks were primarily mysteries, but many different sorts of books found their way into this inclusive line.  A few oddities were published without a map on the back cover.  Dell "War Books" such as #26, ''The Raft'' and #32, ''This Time For Keeps'', had back covers which exhorted the reader to "Buy War Bonds and Stamps", as did books of jokes and cartoons such as #38, ''Liberty Laughs'' and #77, ''G.I. Jokes''.  The rarest mapback of all is #278, ''Second Dell Book of Crossword Puzzles'' edited by Kathleen Rafferty, also map-less.  

Two other genres which had a number of entries in the mapback line were romances and Westerns.  Romances were not frequent, and were by "name" authors such as [[Faith Baldwin]] (#116, ''Honor Bound'') and [[Mary Renault]] (#189, ''Kind Are Her Answers''), only occasionally descending to the level of the "nurse romance".  The quality of Westerns was also generally high, including authors such as [[William MacLeod Raine]] (#179, ''Trail's End'') and Bliss Lomax (Harry Sinclair Drago) (#271, ''Gunsmoke and Trail Dust'').  

There are a number of [[movie tie-in (book)|movie tie-in]] novels in the series.  One of the most significant is #262, ''Rope'' as by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] -- actually written by Don Ward -- with a cover featuring [[James Stewart]].  The second mapback edition of [[Gerald Butler (author)|Gerald Butler]]'s ''Kiss The Blood Off My Hands'' is published as ''The Unafraid'', with a cover photograph of [[Joan Fontaine]] and [[Burt Lancaster]].  Other novels in the series are those upon which well-known films were based, although without movie tie-in covers -- these include ''Tugboat Annie'', ''The Sheik'', ''Now, Voyager'', ''The Harvey Girls'' and Mary Roberts Rinehart's ''The Bat''.  

But by far the largest number of mapbacks is made up of mysteries.  The mapback series contains some significant first editions ("first as such") by famous authors such as [[Dashiell Hammett]], and interesting editions of such authors as [[Rex Stout]] (''[[:Image:Stout-TMC-3.jpg|Too Many Cooks]]'' #45; ''[[Some Buried Caesar|The Red Bull]]'' #70), [[Agatha Christie]], [[Cornell Woolrich]], [[Erle Stanley Gardner]] writing as A. A. Fair, [[John Dickson Carr]] and his alter ego Carter Dickson, and [[Ellery Queen]].  There are editions of other mysteries which have stood the test of time and are still considered moderately significant today, such as the works of [[Phoebe Atwood Taylor]] (under her own name and as Alice Tilton), [[Patricia Wentworth]], [[Stuart Palmer]], [[Clayton Rawson]], [[Earl Derr Biggers]], [[Patricia McGerr]], [[Baynard Kendrick]], [[Margaret Millar]], [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]], [[C. W. Grafton]] (father of [[Sue Grafton]]) and many others.  

The Dell mapback line also contains a number of mysteries by writers who have fallen out of favor over the years -- or who were never popular.  Collectors cherish the [[Camp (style)|camp]] value of such mysteries as ''Murder Wears Mukluks'' by Eunice Mays Boyd, ''The Body That Wasn't Uncle'' by George Worthing Yates, and ''Death Wears a White Gardenia'' by Zelda Popkin.

The mapback line is also notable for what it does not contain -- mapbacks never partook of two popular trends in the 1950s that flourished at other paperback houses, namely the "lesbian confession" novel and the "juvenile delinquent" or "juvie" novel.

'''''Mariana''''' is an 1851 [[panel painting|oil-on-wood]] painting by [[John Everett Millais]]. The image is based on the solitary Mariana from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', written between 1601 and 1606. In the play, Mariana was to be married, but was rejected when her dowry was lost in a shipwreck. Her story was retold in "[[Mariana (poem)|Mariana]]", a poem published in 1830 by [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], which provided additional inspiration for Millais' painting. The painting is regarded as an example of Millais' "precision, attention to detail, and stellar ability as a colorist".&lt;ref name="SallyK"&gt;King, Sally. "[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/millais/paintings/king1.html "Aweary" and Waiting: John Everett Millais's Mariana]". English 156 / History of Art 152, Brown University, 2007. Retrieved 21 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Millais was a founding member of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], a group of English artists who came together in 1848 with the goal of renewing British painting. They found in the art of the early Italian Renaissance—before [[Raphael]]—a sincerity of purpose and clarity of form that they sought to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;Treuherz, J. (2003). ''Pre-Raphaelitism''. Grove Art Online.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:William Hunt Claudio and Isabella Shakespeare Measure for Measure.jpg|thumb|upright|''Mariana'' may have been painted as a companion piece to ''Claudio and Isabella'' (1850) by [[William Holman Hunt]]&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowle|first=Frances|title=Sir John Everett Millais, Bt ''Mariana'' 1851|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-mariana-t07553/text-summary|publisher=The Tate|accessdate=22 January 2013|date=December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Oftentimes the PRB artists used allegorical images to create a narrative, which taught a moral virtue or virtues.  Sometimes they used contemporary literature as inspiration for their paintings, which often include numerous details that allow the viewer to "read" the painting. Millais used Tennyson's poetry to create a narrative for his painting of ''Mariana'' and he wanted to allow the viewer familiar with Tennyson's poetry to read the entire poem through the painting.

When it was first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1851, the display caption contained lines from Tennyson's "Mariana" (1830):

&lt;poem&gt;
    She only said, 'My life is dreary,
      He cometh not,' she said;
    She said, 'I am aweary, aweary,'
      I would that I were dead!'
&lt;/poem&gt;

The painting is packed with details that help the viewer to read the narrative of the work along with Tennyson's poetry.  Everything from the rolled embroidery that Mariana has been working on and the leaves outside of the window point the reader in the direction of the narrative which is about a young woman rejected by her fiancé because her dowry was lost at sea. It is about waiting and the passage of time, which Millais shows by the arched-back pose of the woman.  The pose makes it seem like she has been sitting too long and she must stand up to stretch before she sits again.  The rolled embroidery on the table gives the viewer a clue as to how long Mariana has been working on it.

In the painting ''Mariana'', Millais included many details that relate directly to Tennyson's poetry.  One example is the curtain.  In the poem, Tennyson wrote, "When thickest dark did trance the sky, She drew her casement-curtain by, and glanced athwart the glooming flats".&lt;ref name="Poems and Plays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tennyson|first1=Alfred|title=Poems and Plays|date=1965|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is not a curtain in Millais' painting, this line is similar to the scene that is presented outside of the window.  The viewer perceives an ominous feeling, just like the dark storm that Tennyson alludes to in the line above.  The little mouse that is on the floor towards the bottom right corner is a detail that Millais took from Tennyson's poem: "the mouse behind the mouldering wainscots shriek'd or from the crevice peer'd about".  Together, Millais' painting and Tennyson's poem create an intriguing storyline for the reader to follow.&lt;ref name="Poems and Plays"/&gt;

The '''Motion Picture Association of America''' ('''MPAA''') is an American [[trade association]] representing the [[Major film studio#Current|six major film studios]] of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. Founded in 1922 as the '''Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America''' ('''MPPDA'''), its original goal was to ensure the viability of the American film industry. In addition, the MPAA established guidelines for film content which resulted in the creation of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] in 1930. This code, also known as the Hays Code, was replaced by a voluntary [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|film rating system]] in 1968, which is managed by the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA).

More recently, the MPAA has advocated for the [[Film|motion picture]] and [[television]] industry, with the goals of promoting effective copyright protection, reducing [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]], and expanding market access. It has long worked to curb [[copyright infringement]], including recent attempts to limit the sharing of [[copyright]]ed works via [[peer-to-peer]] [[file-sharing]] networks and by streaming from pirate sites. Former United States Ambassador to France [[Charles Rivkin]] is the current chairman and CEO of the MPAA.

==History==

===Foundation and early history: 1922–29===

The MPAA was founded as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) in 1922 as a [[trade association]] of member motion picture companies. At its founding, MPPDA member companies produced approximately 70 to 80 percent of the films made in the United States.&lt;ref name=NYT22a&gt;{{cite news |title=Ultimatum by Hays to Purify Movies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/06/05/archives/ultimatum-by-hays-to-purify-movies-producers-and-distrihuters-join.html |work=The New York Times |date=5 June 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Will H. Hays]] was named the association's first president.&lt;ref name=Kimono&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dame in the Kimono: Hollywood, Censorship, and the Production Code |last1=Leff |first1=Leonard J. |last2=Simmons |first2=Jerold L. |year=2001 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location= |isbn=0813190118 |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of the MPPDA in its early years was on producing a strong public relations campaign to ensure that [[Hollywood]] remained financially stable and able to attract investment from [[Wall Street]], while simultaneously ensuring that American films had a "clean moral tone".&lt;ref name=NYT22a /&gt;&lt;ref name=EvenNews22&gt;{{cite news |title=Hays Attacks Censors; Says Film Men O.K. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EhdLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IiENAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=2733%2C7216162 |work=The Evening News |date=26 May 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPPDA also instituted a code of conduct for Hollywood's actors in an attempt to govern their behavior offscreen.  Finally, the code sought to protect American film interests abroad by encouraging film studios to avoid racist portrayals of foreigners.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spokesman24&gt;{{cite news |title=Czar of Movies Hits Censorship |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Np5XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=t_MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=5826%2C734859 |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=25 January 1924 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early days of the association, Hays spoke out against public [[Censorship in the United States#Film censorship|censorship]],&lt;ref name="Spokesman24"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT22b&gt;{{cite news |title=Hays Says Public Censors Will Fail |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/07/25/archives/hays-says-public-censors-will-fail-declares-american-principle-of.html |work=The New York Times |date=25 July 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the MPPDA worked to raise support from the general public for the film industry's efforts against such censorship.&lt;ref name=ProvNews22&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Hays, Pledging Motion Picture Industry to Clean Pictures, Asks Public to Aid War on Evil Films |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFBbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QVANAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=4100%2C1398046 |work=Providence News |date=6 July 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large portions of the public opposed censorship, but also decried the lack of morals in movies.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

At the time of the MPPDA's founding, there was no national censorship, but some state and municipal laws required movies to be censored, a process usually oveseen by a local censorship board.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt; Thus, in certain locations in the U.S., films were often edited to comply with local laws regarding the onscreen portrayal of violence and sexuality, among other topics. This resulted in negative publicity for the studios and decreasing numbers of theater goers, who were uninterested in films that were sometimes so severely edited that they were incoherent.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; In 1929, more than 50 percent of American moviegoers lived in a location overseen by such a board.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

In 1924, Hays instituted "The Formula", a loose set of guidelines for filmmakers, in an effort to get the movie industry to self-regulate the issues that the censorship boards had been created to address. "The Formula" requested that studios send synopses of films being considered to the MPPDA for review. This effort largely failed, however, as studios were under no obligation to send their scripts to Hays's office, nor to follow his recommendations.&lt;ref name=Black96&gt;{{cite book |author=Gregory D. Black |title=Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521565928 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybKqnNNR7hwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hollywood+Censored:+Morality+Codes,+Catholics,+and+the+Movies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hIweUZuEJsHe0QG6zoHgBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Hays oversaw the creation of a code of "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" for the industry.&lt;ref name=Black96 /&gt; This list outlined the issues that movies could encounter in different localities. Hays also created a Studio Relations Department (SRD) with staff available to the studios for script reviews and advice regarding potential problems. Again, despite Hays' efforts, studios largely ignored the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls," and by the end of 1929, the MPPDA received only about 20 percent of Hollywood scripts prior to production,&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; and the number of regional and local censorship boards continued to increase.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

===Production Code: 1930–34===

In 1930, the MPPDA introduced the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]], sometimes called the "Hays Code". The Code consisted of moral guidelines regarding what was acceptable to include in films.&lt;ref name=TeleHerald30&gt;{{cite news |title=Movie Industry to Bar Obscenity and Crime Scenes, Plan |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-K9FAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Pb0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=3907%2C1202519 |work=The Telegraph-Herald and Times-Journal |date=2 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the "Dont's and Be Carefuls", which the studios had ignored, the Production Code was endorsed by studio executives.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; The Code incorporated many of the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" as specific examples of what could not be portrayed. Among other rules, the code prohibited inclusion of "scenes of passion" unless they were essential to a film's plot; "pointed profanity" in either word or action; "sex perversion"; justification or explicit coverage of adultery; sympathetic treatment of crime or criminals; dancing with "indecent" moves; and white slavery.&lt;ref name=Calgary30&gt;{{cite news |title=Producers Adopt Code of Conduct For Screen Shows |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WyRkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=3606%2C4315324 |work=The Calgary Daily Herald |date=1 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because studio executives had been involved in the decision to adopt the code, MPPDA-member studios were more willing to submit scripts for consideration. However, the growing economic impacts of the [[Great Depression]] of the early 1930s increased pressure on studios to make films that would draw the largest possible audiences, even if it meant taking their chances with local censorship boards by disobeying the Code.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;

In 1933 and 1934 the [[National Legion of Decency|Catholic Legion of Decency]], along with a number of Protestant and women's groups, launched plans to boycott films that they deemed immoral.&lt;ref name=Bernstein00&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew Bernstein |title=Controlling Hollywood: Censorship and Regulation in the Studio Era |year=2000 |isbn=0813527074 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEYoT857G8UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Controlling+Hollywood:+Censorship+and+Regulation+in+the+Studio+Era&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eIseUamHDaa00AHX1oH4Bg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avert boycotts which might further harm the profitability of the film industry, the MPPDA created a new department, the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA), with [[Joseph Breen]] as its head. Unlike previous attempts at self-censorship, PCA decisions were binding—no film could be exhibited in an American theater without a stamp of approval from the PCA,&lt;ref name=Black96 /&gt; and any producer attempting to do so faced a fine of $25,000.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; After ten years of unsuccessful voluntary codes and expanding local censorship boards, the studio approved and agreed to enforce the codes, and the nationwide "Production Code" was enforced starting on July 1, 1934.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

===War years: 1935–45===

In the years that immediately followed the adoption of the Code, Breen often sent films back to Hollywood for additional edits, and in some cases, simply refused to issue PCA approval for a film to be shown.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;&lt;ref name=LewistonTrib34&gt;{{cite news |title=Pictures Purged |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-Z5fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wzEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=3861%2C4395343 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |date=15 July 1934 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Hays promoted the industry's new focus on wholesome films&lt;ref name=SpokaneChron35&gt;{{cite news |title=Newest Pictures Based on Classics |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=atRXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_fQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=2505%2C6402892 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=26 March 1935 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued promoting American films abroad.&lt;ref name=MilJournal36&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Hays Gets Italy to Lift Film Blockage |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PHYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_yEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=will-hays&amp;pg=6885%2C5924504 |work=The Milwaukee Journal |date=25 November 1936 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For nearly three years, studios complied with the Code. By 1938, however, as the threat of war in Europe loomed, movie producers began to worry about the possibility of decreased profits abroad. This led to a decreased investment in following the strictures of the code, and occasional refusals to comply with PCA demands.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; That same year, responding to trends in European films in the run-up to the war, Hays spoke out against using movies as a vehicle for [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name=PittPress38&gt;{{cite news |title=Hays Scores Propaganda On Screens |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LE0bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D0wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=4508%2C6029095 |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=30 March 1938 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, after 24 years as president, Hays stepped down from his position at the MPPDA, although he continued to act as an advisor for the Association for the next five years.&lt;ref name="SpokesReview45"&gt;{{cite news |title=Eric Johnston to Rule Movies |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vipWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o-QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=will-hays%20and%20johnston&amp;pg=6105%2C4697631 |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=20 September 1945 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 the MPPDA hired [[Eric Johnston]], four-time president of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], to replace Hays.&lt;ref name=SpokChron45&gt;{{cite news |title=Johnston Named Motion Picture Czar |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7NZYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jvUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=will-hays%20and%20johnston&amp;pg=6668%2C3421898 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=19 September 1945 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first year as president, Johnston rebranded the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;

In 1956, Johnston oversaw the first major revision of the Production Code since it was created in 1930. This revision allowed the treatment of some subjects which had previously been forbidden, including abortion and the use of narcotics, so long as they were "within the limits of good taste". At the same time, the revisions added a number of new restrictions to the code, including outlawing the depiction of blasphemy and mercy killings in films.&lt;ref name=RG56&gt;{{cite news |title=Motion Picture Code Made 'More Flexible' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JRFWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cOIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mpaa%20johnston&amp;pg=6763%2C3434436 |work=Eugene Register Guard |date=17 December 1956 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston was well-liked by studio executives, and his political connections helped him function as an effective liaison between Hollywood and Washington.&lt;ref name=Valenti07p271&gt;{{cite book |author=Jack Valenti |title=This Time, This Place |year=2007 |isbn=9780307346650 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |location=New York |page=271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, while still serving as president of the MPAA, Johnston died of a stroke.&lt;ref name=Petersburg63&gt;{{cite news |title=Eric Johnston Dies at 66 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uJtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sVIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=eric-johnston&amp;pg=2746%2C970120 |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=23 August 1963 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three years, the MPAA operated without a president while studio executives searched for a replacement.&lt;ref name=MPAAHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpaa.org/about/history |title=History of the MPAA |work=MPAA.org |publisher=Motion Picture Association of America |accessdate=23 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621235047/http://www.mpaa.org/about/history |archivedate=June 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film rating system==

{{Main|Motion Picture Association of America film rating system}}

In 1968, the MPAA established the Code and Rating Administration, or CARA (later renamed the Classification and Rating Administration), which began issuing ratings for films exhibited and distributed commercially in the United States to help parents determine what films are appropriate for their children.

Since the  [[motion picture rating system|rating system]] was first introduced in November 1968, it has gone through several changes, including the addition of a PG-13 rating.&lt;ref name=Coe68&gt;{{cite news |title=Film Classification Starts Nov. 1 |author=Richard L.

In 2006 the film ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' alleged that the MPAA gave preferential treatment to member studios during the process of assigning ratings,&lt;ref name=Travers06&gt;{{cite news |title=''This Film Is Not Yet Rated'' |author=Peter Travers |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/this-film-is-not-yet-rated-20060803 |work=Rolling Stone |date=3 August 2006 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as criticizing the rating process for its lack of transparency.

In 1995 the MPAA members were: the Walt Disney Studios; Paramount Pictures; Universal Studios; Warner Bros; 20th Century Fox; MGM—which included United Artists after their 1981 merger—and [[Sony Pictures]], which included Columbia and [[TriStar Pictures]] after their acquisition in 1989.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David |title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Wtergate and Vietnam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVygqYMVP2wC&amp;q=mgm+united+artist#v=snippet&amp;q=mgm%20united%20artist&amp;f=false |accessdate=7 March 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0520232658 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1989-08&gt;{{cite news|title=Sony to Buy Columbia, Says Americans Will Run Studio : 1st Sale of Film Maker to Japanese |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-27/news/mn-335_1_columbia-pictures-entertainment|accessdate=24 September 2012 |newspaper=latimes.com |date=27 September 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turner Entertainment]] joined the MPAA in 1995, but was purchased in 1996 by [[Time Warner]].&lt;ref name=Wharton&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Wharton |title=Turner Pix Joins MPAA |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3S3M-F440-0006-000R&amp;csi=140595&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |newspaper=Daily Variety |date=25 January 1995 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fabrikant&gt;{{cite news |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |title=Holders Back Time Warner-Turner Merger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/11/business/holders-back-time-warner-turner-merger.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=11 October 1996 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content protection efforts==
The MPAA's concerted efforts at fighting [[copyright infringement]] began in 1975 with the establishment of the Film Security Office, which sought to recover unauthorized recordings of films in order to prevent duplication.&lt;ref name="Clabaugh04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WindsorStar75"/&gt; The MPAA has continued to pursue a number of initiatives to combat illegal distribution of films and TV shows, especially in response to new technologies. In the 1980s, it spoke out against [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] and the threat that the MPAA believed they represented to the movie industry,&lt;ref name=Marbach82&gt;{{cite news |title=Putting the Bite On the Home VCR |author=William D. Marbach |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3SJ4-FRJ0-0008-X3VM&amp;csi=5774&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=Newsweek |date=26 April 1982 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with MPAA president [[Jack Valenti]] drawing a parallel between the threat of the VCR and that of the [[Boston Strangler]].&lt;ref name=Jones87&gt;{{cite news |title=The invasion of the VCRs |author=Malcolm Jones |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3SKP-90V0-0060-2035&amp;csi=11063&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=26 April 1987 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the MPAA asked Congress to pass a law that would require VCRs to come equipped with a chip to prevent them from making copies.&lt;ref name="McCloskey86"/&gt; Legal efforts at stopping homemade copies of broadcast television largely ended, however, when the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that such copying constituted [[fair use]].&lt;ref name=CommDaily87&gt;{{cite news |title='Distortion' Charged; DAT Anticopy Technology Debated At Joint Hill Hearing |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3TVV-HHR0-0019-30PX&amp;csi=6944&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=Communications Daily |date=3 April 1987 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPAA continued to support law enforcement efforts to stop [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] production and distribution of videos tapes and [[laserdisc]]s into the 1990s,&lt;ref name="Billboard91"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein94&gt;{{cite news |title=Picture This |author=Seth Goldstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA53&amp;dq=MPAA%20laserdiscs&amp;pg=RA1-PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |work=Billboard |date=21 May 1994 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000 took successful legal action against individuals posting [[DVD]] [[Digital rights management#DRM and film|decryption software]] on the Internet in [[Universal City Studios, Inc. v.

The MPAA has continued to support law enforcement efforts to prevent illegal distribution of copyrighted materials online.&lt;ref name=Lieberman13&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA Cheers Prison Sentence For Leader Of Internet Piracy Ring |author=David Lieberman |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/01/mpaa-imagine-group-justice-department-conviction-sentencing/ |work=Deadline.com |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPAA and its British counterpart, the [[Federation Against Copyright Theft]] (FACT), also funded the training of [[Lucky and Flo]], a pair of [[Labrador Retrievers]], to detect polycarbonates used in the manufacturing of DVDs.&lt;ref name=Kirk06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125679/article.html |title=MPAA Trains Dogs to Sniff Out Pirate DVDs |author=Jeremy Kirk |date=11 May 2006 |work=PCWorld |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online file sharing===
In the early 2000s, the MPAA began focusing its efforts to curb copyright infringement specifically on [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]], initially using a combination of educational campaigns&lt;ref name=Atkinson03&gt;{{cite news |title=Music piracy persists at Boston U., nationwide despite lawsuits |author=Dan Atkinson |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4B6F-HJW0-00K4-105J&amp;csi=172244&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=University Wire |date=10 December 2003 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cease and desist]] letters to discourage such activity. In the first six months of 2002, the MPAA sent more than 18,000 such letters to [[internet service provider]]s to forward to users engaged in copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=Woolley02&gt;{{cite news |title=Shiver me timbers: Online bootlegs bane of entertainment industry |author=Simon Woolley |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4600-8XW0-015H-052Y&amp;csi=244819&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=Townsville Bulletin/Townsville Sun |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, the MPAA changed course and filed lawsuits in a concerted effort to address copyright infringement on a number of large online file-sharing services, including [[BitTorrent]] and [[eDonkey network|eDonkey]].&lt;ref name=Locklear04&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2004/12/4467-2/ |title=MPAA lawsuits target BitTorrent, eDonkey and Direct Connect networks |author=Fred Locklear |date=14 December 2004 |work=Ars Technica |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the MPAA expanded its legal actions to include lawsuits against individuals who downloaded and distributed copyrighted material via peer-to-peer networks.&lt;ref name=Johnson05&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA Anti-Piracy Lawsuits Target Individuals |author=Bary Alyssa Johnson |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4H0K-M4X0-01KX-14V2&amp;csi=262320&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=PC Magazine |date=29 August 2005 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPAA also played a role in encouraging the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] to conduct [[the Pirate Bay raid|a raid of the Pirate Bay]] file-sharing website in May 2006.&lt;ref name=Mennecke06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/story1227.html |title=Sweden Pressured to take Pirate Bay Action |author=Thomas Mennecke |date=20 June 2006 |work=Slyck.com |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish officials have acknowledged that part of the motivation for the raid was the threat of sanctions from the [[World Trade Organization]], along with a letter from the MPAA.&lt;ref name=Ahrens06&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Joins Industry in Piracy War |author=Frank Ahrens |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/14/AR2006061402071.html |work=The Washington Post |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ewing06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/4128/20060621/#.UTdo1nyY4RE |title=US threatened Sweden with sanctions over piracy |author=Adam Ewing |date=21 June 2006 |work=The Local |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Center for Copyright Information]] unveiled the [[Copyright Alert System]], a system established through an agreement between the MPAA, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], and five of the USA's largest [[internet service providers]].&lt;ref name=Miller13&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA-Backed Copyright Alert System Unveiled |author=Sean J.

Users were then informed that their accounts were being used for possible copyright infringement and were provided with information about ways to get authorized content online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The new copyright alert system is running |author=Sarah Laskow |url=http://www.cjr.org/cloud_control/cas_system_already_in_action.php?page=all |work=Columbia Journalism Review |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users who received multiple notices of infringement faced "mitigations measures," such as temporary slowing of their Internet service, but the system did not include termination of subscriber accounts. Subscribers facing such action had a right to appeal to the [[American Arbitration Association]].&lt;ref name=CASFAQs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/copyright-alert-system-faqs/ |title=Copyright Alert System FAQs |work=copyrightinformation.org |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the Copyright Alert System was discontinued.  While no official reason was given, the MPAA's general counsel stated that the system had not been equipped to stop repeat infringers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Ted|title=Internet Service Providers, Studios and Record Labels Call It Quits on Copyright Alert System|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/copyright-alerts-piracy-mpaa-comcast-att-1201971756/|work=Variety|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 24, 2014, the [[Sony Pictures hack]] revealed that following a lawsuit in which the MPAA won a multimillion judgment against [[Hotfile]], a file hosting website, the MPAA colluded with Hotfile to misrepresent the settlement so that the case would serve as a deterrent. The settlement was previously believed to be $80 million and was widely reported; however, Hotfile only paid the studios $4 million and agreed to have the $80 million figure recorded as the judgment and the website shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van der Sar|first1=Ernesto|title=MPAA Secretly Settled With Hotfile for $4 Million, Not $80 Million|url=https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-secretly-settled-hotfile-4-million-80-million-141224/|work=Torrentfreak|date=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/sony-email-leak-has-uncovered-the-truth-behind-mpaa-and-hotfile-dispute|title=Sony email leak has uncovered the truth behind MPAA and Hotfile dispute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141224/06321429517/sony-hack-reveals-that-mpaas-big-80-million-settlement-with-hotfile-was-lie.shtml|title=Sony Hack Reveals That MPAA's Big '$80 Million' Settlement With Hotfile Was A Lie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case resolved in 2015, the MPAA and others supported the [[United States International Trade Commission]] (ITC)'s decision to consider electronic transmissions to the U.S. as "articles" so that it could prevent the importation of digital files of counterfeit goods. While the case being considered by the ITC involved dental appliances, the ITC could have also used such authority to bar the importation of pirated movies and TV shows from rogue foreign websites that traffic in infringing content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Eriq|title=With the MPAA Watching, ITC Says Case About Teeth Won't Bring Down the Internet|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/mpaa-watching-itc-says-case-775397|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals took up the matter, and ultimately ruled against the ITC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Ted|title=MPAA Warns Appellate Ruling Could Limit Ability to Fight Digital Piracy|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/mpaa-digital-goods-piracy-google-1201637501/|work=Variety|date=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the MPAA reported [[Putlocker]] as one of the "top 5 rogue cyberlocker services" to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] as a major piracy threat; the website was then blocked in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandoval |first=Greg |date=31 March 2012 |title=MPAA wants more criminal cases brought against 'rogue' sites |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/mpaa-wants-more-criminal-cases-brought-against-rogue-sites/ |publisher=[[CNET]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Prabhu |first=Vijay |date=17 October 2016 |title=Yet Another Video Streaming Service Bites The Dust, Putlocker Shuts Down |url=http://www.techworm.net/2016/10/putlocker-video-streaming-service-shuts.html |publisher=TechWorm |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bolton |first=Doug |date=26 May 2016 |title=Putlocker blocked in the UK by internet service providers after High Court order |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/putlocker-blocked-down-virgin-media-sky-internet-streaming-watch-online-videos-a7050056.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversies==
===Publicity campaigns===
The MPAA has also produced publicity campaigns to discourage piracy. The ''[[Who Makes Movies?]]'' advertising campaign in 2003 highlighted workers in the movie industry describing how piracy affected them. The video spots ran as trailers before movies, and as television advertisements.&lt;ref name=Boliek03&gt;{{cite news |title=H'wood steps up antipiracy fight |author=Brooks Boliek |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4BG8-SXP0-01V4-X35T&amp;csi=12015&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=23 July 2003 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the MPAA began using the slogan "[[You can click, but you can't hide]]". This slogan appeared in messages that replaced file-sharing websites after they had been shut down through MPAA legal action.&lt;ref name=BBC05&gt;{{cite news |title=Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4256449.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in posters and videos distributed to video stores by the MPAA.&lt;ref name=Hernandez04&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA Files Piracy Suits |author=Greg Hernandez |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4DTP-V1K0-TWDH-T3C9&amp;csi=157105&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=The Daily News of Los Angeles |date=17 November 2004 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2004, the MPAA partnered with the [[Intellectual Property Office of Singapore]] to release [[You Wouldn't Steal a Car|a trailer shown before films in theaters equating piracy with theft]].&lt;ref name=IPOS04&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipos.gov.sg/main/newsroom/media_rel/mediarelease1_270704.html |title=Be HIP at the Movies |author= |date=27 July 2004 |work=Intellectual Property Office of Singapore |accessdate=6 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924044120/http://www1.ipos.gov.sg/main/newsroom/media_rel/mediarelease1_270704.html |archivedate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer was later placed at the beginning of the video on many DVDs in such a way that it could not be bypassed (not being able to skip or fast-forward), which triggered criticism and a number of parodies.&lt;ref name=Rohrer09&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8106805.stm |title=Getting inside a downloader's head |author=Finlo Rohrer |date=18 June 2009 |work=BBC |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the MPAA commissioned a study to examine the effects of file sharing on movie industry profitability. The study concluded that the industry lost $6.1 billion per year to piracy, and that up to 44 percent of domestic losses were due to file sharing by college students. In 2008, the MPAA revised the percentage of loss due to college students down to 15 percent, citing human error in the initial calculations of this figure. Beyond the percentage of the loss that was attributable to college students, however, no other errors were found in the study.&lt;ref name=Pope08&gt;{{cite news|title=MPAA admits mistake on downloading study |author=Justin Pope |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/98009/page/1 |work=Newsweek |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207045516/http://www.newsweek.com/id/98009/page/1 |archivedate=February 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, theaters began airing the MPAA's "I Make Movies" series, an ad campaign intended to combat piracy by highlighting the stories of behind-the-scenes employees in the film and television industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title=MPAA to Run 'I Make Movies' Ads at AMC Theaters, Local Cinema Chains|url=https://www.thewrap.com/mpaa-to-run-i-make-movies-ads-at-amc-theaters-local-cinema-chains/|work=The Wrap|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series pointed audiences to the MPAA's "WhereToWatch" website (later dubbed "The Credits")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecredits.org/|website=mpaa.org|title=The Credits|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides attention to the behind-the-scenes creativity involved in making movies.

===Accusations of copyright infringement===
The MPAA itself has been accused of copyright infringement on multiple occasions. In 2007, the creator of a [[Blog software|blogging platform]] called Forest Blog accused the MPAA of violating the license for the platform, which required that users link back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA had used the platform for its own blog, but without linking back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA subsequently took the blog offline, and explained that the software had been used on a test basis and the blog had never been publicized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MPAA: We Were Only Testing Forest Blog|url=https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-we-were-only-testing-forest-blog|work=Torrentfreak|date=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2007/02/19/MPAA_violates_software_license/ |title=MPAA violates software license |author=Brett Thomas |date=19 February 2007 |work=bit-tech.net |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110183631/http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2007/02/19/MPAA_violates_software_license/ |archivedate=November 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, the MPAA released a software toolkit for universities to help identify cases of file sharing on campus. The software used parts of the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[Linux]] distribution, released under the [[GNU General Public License|General Public License]], which stipulates that the source code of any projects using the distribution be made available to third parties. The source code for the MPAA's toolkit, however, was not made available. When the MPAA was made aware of the violation, the software toolkit was removed from their website.&lt;ref name=Paul07&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA's University Toolkit hit with DMCA takedown notice after GPL violation |author=Ryan Paul |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/12/mpaas-university-toolkit-hit-with-dmca-takedown-notice-after-gpl-violation/ |work=Ars Technica |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the MPAA admitted having made illegal copies of ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' (a documentary exploring the MPAA itself and the history of its [[MPAA film rating system|rating system]])&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060130093854/http://www.latimes.com/business/custom/cotown/cl-et-mpaa24jan24,0,2188275.story MPAA finds itself accused of piracy], by John Horn; at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (via [[archive.org]]); published January 24, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; — an act which ''[[Ars Technica]]'' explicitly described as [[hypocrisy]]&lt;ref name=ArsTech&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/01/6036-2/ MPAA admits to unauthorized movie copying], by Eric Bangeman, at ''[[Ars Technica]]''; published January 24, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and which [[Roger Ebert]] called "rich irony".&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com/festivals-and-awards/sundance-7-film-ratings-exposed Sundance #7: Film ratings exposed!], by [[Roger Ebert]]; at [[RogerEbert.com]]; published January 26, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The MPAA subsequently claimed that it had the legal right to copy the film despite this being counter to the filmmaker's explicit request, because the documentary's exploration of the MPAA's ratings board was potentially a violation of the board members' privacy.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

The '''National Monument to the Forefathers''', formerly known as the '''''Pilgrim Monument''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Massachusetts of To-day
|first= Daniel P. |last=Toomey |year=1892 |publisher=Columbia publishing company |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; commemorates the ''[[Mayflower]]'' [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].  Dedicated on August 1, 1889, it honors their ideals as later generally embraced by the [[United States]]. It is thought to be the world's largest solid granite monument.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Planning and Engineering, Resource Management Planning Program, September 2006. "[http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dcr/stewardship/rmp/rmpforefathers.pdf Resource Management Plan: National Monument to the Forefathers, Plymouth, Massachusetts]", p 1. Accessed 8 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Located at 72 Allerton Street in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], the {{convert|81|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} monument was commissioned by the Pilgrim Society.  The original concept dates to around 1820, with actual planning beginning in 1850. The cornerstone was laid August 2, 1859 by the Grand Lodge of Masons in Massachusetts, under the direction of Grand Master John T. Heard. The monument was completed in October 1888, and was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies on August 1, 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.plymouthguide.com/monument.html| title=Forefathers Monument| author=Plymouth Guide| accessdate=May 16, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060511222601/http://www.plymouthguide.com/monument.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammatt Billings, Boston architect, illustrator and sculptor, originally conceived the monument as a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} structure comparable to the [[Colossus of Rhodes]]. Shortly before his death in 1874, Billings reduced the size of the monument, which was to be made entirely of [[granite]] quarried in [[Hallowell, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kjonline.com/news/Hallowell-to-celebrate-a-long-forgotten-past-Saturday-.html | title=Hallowell to Celebrate a Long Forgotten Past Saturday| author=Michael Shepherd| accessdate=July 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was then passed to Billings' brother Joseph who, along with other sculptors including [[Alexander Doyle]], [[Carl Conrads]], and James Mahoney, reworked the design, although the basic components remained. The monument, which faces northeast to Plymouth Harbor (and, roughly, towards Plymouth, England), sits in the center of a circular drive, which is accessed from Allerton Street from the east.  The plan of the principal pedestal is [[octagon]]al, with four small, and four large faces; from the small faces project four [[buttress]]es. On the main pedestal stands the heroic figure of "Faith" with her right hand pointing toward heaven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=S508Q49160860.415&amp;profile=ariall&amp;uri=link=3100009~!1466888~!3100001~!3100002&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;term=National+Monument+to+the+Forefathers,&amp;index=ALTIT|title=National Monument to the Forefathers|first1=Hammatt|last1=Billings|first2=Joseph|last2=Billings|first3=William|last3=Rimmer|first4=John D.|last4=Perry|first5=Alexander|last5=Doyle|first6=Karl|last6=Conrad|first7=James H.|last7=Mahoney|date=24 October 2017|publisher=|via=siris-artinventories.si.edu Library Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her left hand clutching the Bible. Upon the four buttresses also are seated figures emblematical of the principles upon which the Pilgrims founded their Commonwealth; counter-clockwise from the east are Morality, Law, Education, and Liberty. Each was carved from a solid block of granite, posed in the sitting position upon chairs with a [[Alto-relievo|high relief]] on either side of minor characteristics.  Under "Morality" stand "Prophet" and "Evangelist"; under "Law" stand "Justice" and "Mercy"; under "Education" are "Youth" and "Wisdom"; and under "Liberty" stand "Tyranny Overthrown" and "Peace".  On the face of the buttresses, beneath these figures are high reliefs in [[marble]], representing scenes from Pilgrim history.  Under "Morality" is "Embarcation"; under "Law" is "Treaty"; under "Education" is "Compact"; and under "Freedom" is "Landing".   Upon the four faces of the main pedestal are large panels for records. The front panel is inscribed as follows: ''"National Monument to the Forefathers. Erected by a grateful people in remembrance of their labors, sacrifices and sufferings for the cause of civil and religious liberty."''  The right and left panels contain the names of those who came over in the ''Mayflower''. The rear panel, which was not engraved until recently, contains a quote from [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|Governor William Bradford]]'s famous history, ''[[Of Plymouth Plantation]]'': 
:''"Thus out of small beginnings greater things have been produced by His hand that made all things of nothing and gives being to all things that are; and as one small candle may light a thousand, so the light here kindled hath shone unto many, yea in some sort to our whole nation; let the glorious name of Jehovah have all praise."''

The overall scheme was designed by architect [[Hammatt Billings]]. The 36-foot figure of ''Faith'' was based on a 9-foot plaster model by [[William Rimmer]] in 1875,&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Craven et al, ‘’200 Years of American Sculpture’’, David R. Godine, Publisher in association with the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 1976 p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; that was enlarged and altered by [[Joseph Edward Billings]] and a sculptor named Perry (probably John D. Perry). The subsidiary statues were executed by area sculptors including [[Alexander Doyle]], [[Carl Conrads]], and James H. Mahoney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Gorman|first=James F.|date=September 1995|title=The Colossus of Plymouth: Hammatt Billings's National Monument to the Forefathers|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|publisher=University of California Press|volume=54|issue=3|pages=278–301|jstor=990993|doi=10.2307/990993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Register==
The monument was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on August 30, 1974.  Originally under the care of the Pilgrim Society, it was given to  the [[Massachusetts]] government in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/rmp/rmp-forefathers.htm|title=Resource Management Plan, National Monument to the Forefathers|author=[[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]]|accessdate=May 18, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133531/http://mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/rmp/rmp-forefathers.htm|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It and [[Plymouth Rock]] constitute the [[Pilgrim Memorial State Park]].  Although intended as national in scope, the Forefathers Monument is not a federal "[[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]]" as understood today from the [[Antiquities Act|Antiquities Act of 1906]].

==''Monumental'' movie==
In 2012, [[Kirk Cameron]] released the movie ''[[Monumental: In Search of America's National Treasure|Monumental]]'' which features the monument and Cameron's interpretation of its history and the values of those it commemorates.&lt;ref name="misoant20120328"&gt;{{Citation

The '''National Theatre''' in [[Oslo]] ('''{{lang-no|Nationaltheatret}}''') is one of [[Norway]]'s largest and most prominent venues for performance of dramatic arts.

The theatre had its first performance on 1 September 1899 but can trace its origins to [[Christiania Theatre]], which was founded in 1829. There were three official opening performances, on subsequent days in September: first, selected pieces by [[Ludvig Holberg]], then ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' by [[Henrik Ibsen]], and on the third day ''[[Sigurd I of Norway|Sigurd Jorsalfar]]'' by [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]].

==History==
The National Theatre was founded as a private institution and weathered several financial crises until 1929, when the Norwegian government started providing modest support. A number of famous Norwegians have served as artistic directors for the theatre, but [[Vilhelm Krag]] who took over in 1911, is credited as having brought the theatre into its "golden age."
[[File:NationalTheatretBack.jpg|thumb|left]]
The theatre is often considered the home for Ibsen's plays, and most of his works have been performed here. Notable is also the children's Christmas play, ''The Journey to the Christmas Star'' ({{lang|no|Reisen til Julestjernen}}), written by the then theatre's finance director [[Sverre Brandt]] and performed for the first time in 1924.

The main building is centrally located between the [[Royal Palace, Oslo]] and the [[Parliament of Norway]].  It is served by [[National Theatre Station]] and [[National Theatre metro station]]s.  It was designed by [[architect]] [[Henrik Bull]].
The theatre organisation manages four stages: the main stage ({{lang|no|Hovedscenen}}), the amphitheatre ({{lang|no|Amfiscenen}}) and Painting Parlour ({{lang|no|Malersalen}}) within the main building.  The fourth is the Torshov Theatre ({{lang|no|Torshovteatret}}) in the [[Torshov]] district of Oslo.
{{As of|2009}}, the theatre's artistic director was [[Hanne Tømta]].

{{Literature}}

A '''novella''' is a text of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a [[short story]] but shorter than a [[novel]], somewhere between 17,500 and 40,000 words.

The English word "''novella''{{-"}} derives from the Italian ''novella'', feminine of ''novello'', which means "new".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/novella |title=Novella - Definition |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary online|accessdate= 7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novella is a common [[literary genre]] in several European languages.

==History==
The novella as a literary genre began developing in the early [[Renaissance]] by the Italian and French ''literatura'', principally [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], author of ''[[The Decameron]]'' (1353).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/novella | title=Novella: Definition and history  |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary online| accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Decameron'' featured 100 tales (novellas) told by 10 people (seven women and three men) fleeing the [[Black Death]], by escaping from [[Florence]] to the Fiesole hills in 1348. This structure was then imitated by subsequent authors, notably the French queen [[Marguerite de Navarre]], whose ''[[Heptameron|Heptaméron]]'' (1559) included 72 original French tales and was modeled after the structure of ''The Decameron''.

Not until the late 18th and early 19th centuries did writers fashion the novella into a literary genre structured by precepts and rules, generally in a [[Realism (arts)|realistic mode]]. At that time, the Germans were the most active writers of the ''novelle'' (German: "Novelle"; plural: "Novellen").{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} For the German writer, a novella is a fictional narrative of indeterminate length—a few pages to hundreds—restricted to a single, suspenseful event, situation, or conflict leading to an unexpected turning point (''Wendepunkt''), provoking a logical but surprising end. ''Novellen'' tend to contain a concrete symbol, which is the narrative's focal point.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Structure==
A novella generally features fewer [[Conflict (narrative)|conflicts]] than a [[novel]], yet more complicated ones than a [[short story]]. The conflicts also have more time to develop than in short stories. Novellas may or may not be divided into chapters (good examples of those with chapters are ''[[Animal Farm]]'' by [[George Orwell]] and ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]]) and are often intended to be read at a single sitting, as is the short story, although in a novella white space is often used to divide the sections, and therefore, the novella maintains a single effect.&lt;ref name="bf1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kercheval|first=Jesse Lee|title=Building Fiction|publisher=Story Press|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|year=1997|chapter=Short shorts, novellas, novel-in-stories|isbn=1-884910-28-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warren Cariou]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The novella is generally not as formally experimental as the long story and the novel can be, and it usually lacks the subplots, the multiple points of view, and the generic adaptability that are common in the novel. It is most often concerned with personal and emotional development rather than with the larger social sphere. The novella generally retains something of the unity of impression that is a hallmark of the short story, but it also contains more highly developed characterization and more luxuriant description.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of literature in Canada''. Edited by William H. New. University of Toronto, 2000. Page 835.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Versus novel==
:''See the article [[Novel]] for the historical generic debate''.
:''See the article [[Word count]] for comparative word counts''.

This etymological distinction avoids confusion of the literatures and the forms, with the novel being the more important, established fictional form.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Austrian writer [[Stefan Zweig]]'s ''[[The Royal Game|Die Schachnovelle]]'' (1942) (literally, "The Chess Novella", but translated in 1944 as ''The Royal Game'') is an example of a title naming its genre.

Commonly, longer novellas are referred to as novels; Robert Louis Stevenson's ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886) and Joseph Conrad's ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899) are sometimes called novels,{{by whom|date=September 2014}} as are many [[science fiction]] works such as H. G. Wells' ''The War of the Worlds'' (1897) and  Philip Francis Nowlan's ''[[Armageddon 2419 A.D.]]'' (1928). Less often, longer works are referred to as novellas. The subjectivity of the parameters of the novella genre is indicative of its shifting and diverse nature as an art form.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} In her 2010 ''[[Open Letters Monthly]]'' series, "A Year With Short Novels", Ingrid Norton criticizes the tendency to make clear demarcations based purely on a book's length:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On a web search engine, input "novels" and "length" and you will find tables of word counts, separating out novels from novellas, even from the esoteric and still shorter "novelette"—as though prose works were dog show contestants, needing to be entered into proper categories. But when it comes to writing, any distinctions that begin with an objective and external quality like size are bound to be misleading. The delicate, gem-like jigsaw of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey|The Bridge of San Luis Ray]]'' {{sic}} could not be more unlike the feverishly cunning philosophical monologue of [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Fall (Camus novel)|The Fall]]'', but both novels are about the same length.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/the-sweetness-of-short-novels/ The Sweetness of Short Novels]" by [http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/author/norton/ Ingrid Norton], Open Letters Monthly February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Stephen King]], in his introduction to ''[[Different Seasons]]'', a collection of four novellas, has called the novella "an ill-defined and disreputable literary banana republic";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first= Stephen|title=Different Seasons|publisher=Viking Adult|year=1982|isbn=978-0-670-27266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; King notes the difficulties of selling a novella in the commercial publishing world, since it does not fit the typical length requirements of either magazine or book publishers.  Despite these problems, however, the novella's length provides unique advantages; in the introduction to a novella anthology titled ''Sailing to Byzantium'', [[Robert Silverberg]] writes:

{{bquote|[The novella] is one of the richest and most rewarding of literary forms...it allows for more extended development of theme and character than does the short story, without making the elaborate structural demands of the full-length book.  Thus it provides an intense, detailed exploration of its subject, providing to some degree both the concentrated focus of the short story and the broad scope of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Silverberg, Robert|title=Sailing to Byzantium|location=New York|publisher= ibooks, inc.|date= 2000|isbn= 0-7861-9905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his essay, "Briefly, the case for the novella", Canadian author George Fetherling (who wrote the novella ''Tales of Two Cities'') said that to reduce the novella to nothing more than a short novel is like "insisting that a pony is a baby horse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fetherling, George |url=http://www.sevenoaksmag.com/commentary/94_comm1.html |title=Briefly, the case for the novella |work=Seven Oaks Magazine |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20120912031610/http://www.sevenoaksmag.com/commentary/94_comm1.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sometimes blurry definition between a novel and a novella can create controversy, as was the case with British writer [[Ian McEwan]]'s ''[[On Chesil Beach]]'' (2007). The author described it as a novella, but the panel for the [[Man Booker Prize]] in 2007 qualified the book as a "short novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ian McEwan claims the novella is better than the novel|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9608935/Ian-McEwan-claims-the-novella-is-better-than-the-novel.html|accessdate=27 September 2015|work=The Telegraph|agency=Telegraph Media Group Limited|issue=HOME»CULTURE»BOOKS»BOOK NEWS|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=&lt;!-- 11:29AM BST --&gt; 15 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this "novella" was shortlisted for an award for best original novel. A similar case is found with a much older work of fiction: ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' (1903) by [[Jack London]]. This book, by modern standards, is short enough and straightforward enough to qualify as a novella. However, historically, it has been regarded as a novel.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Versus novelette==
Dictionaries define '''''novelette''''' similarly to ''novella''; sometimes identically,&lt;ref&gt;
[[American Heritage Dictionary]] (4th ed.): [http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/novella novella (2)], [http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/novelette novelette];
[[Merriam-Webster]] Online Dictionary: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/novelette novelette];
&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes with a disparaging sense of being trivial or sentimental.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Collins Dictionary]]: [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/novella novella (2)], [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/novelette novelette (2)];
[[Macmillan Dictionary]] (US ed.): [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/novella novella], [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/novelette novelette];
[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]] (UK ed.): [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/novella novella], [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/novella novelette]; novelette];
[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]: [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/novella?view=uk novella], [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/novelette?view=uk novelette];
[[Webster's New World Dictionary]]: [http://websters.yourdictionary.com/novella novella], [http://websters.yourdictionary.com/novelette novelette];
&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[literary award]]s have a longer "novella" and a shorter "novelette" categories, with a distinction based on [[word count]]. A range between 7,500 and 17,500 words is common among awards.&lt;ref name="nebularules"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsfs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sjarules"/&gt;

==Word counts==
Some [[literary awards]] include a "best novella" award and sometimes a separate "best novelette" award, separately from "best short story" or "best novel". The distinction between these categories may be entirely by [[word count]].

Opera America also hosts businesses, educational institutions, libraries, foundations, guilds, and opera artists such as singers and composers. It is also the home of New York Children's Opera Studio.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The organization was founded in 1970 and has been led by President and CEO Marc A. Scorca since 1990.

In April 2014, advisers from Opera America worked with [[San Diego Opera]] to develop a plan to prevent the company's closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/apr/18/san-diego-opera-closure-postponed/|title=S.D.

Opera America's National Opera Center has two performance venues - Marc A. Scorca Hall and Plácido Domingo Hall. The National Opera Center has been the venue of performances by artists of companies such as Wolf Trap Opera. In 2016 and 2018, the Christman Opera Company premiered the operas ''Adriana McMannes'' and ''A Metamorphosis'' in Scorca Hall and Domingo Hall, respectively.[http://www.vocedimeche.reviews/2016/09/a-newborn-arrives.html][http://www.vocedimeche.reviews/2018/10/rachel-barg-sooyeon-kang-theodore.html][http://operawire.com/christman-opera-company-2018-review-adriana-mcmannes-a-metamorphosis/]

'''''Padmé''''' is a ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fan film]] produced by [[Jason Ginsburg]], [[Robert Reeves (director)|Robert Reeves]], and [[Kevin W. Walsh]].  The short was written by Walsh and directed by Reeves. 

The film won the George Lucas Selects Award in the 2008 [[The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards|Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards]], co-sponsored by [[Atom.com]] and [[Lucasfilm]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5031621/padm-wins-as-best-star-wars-fan-film-of-the-year io9 announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; and aired on both [[Spike TV]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atom.com/funny_videos/sw_spike_promo_08/ Padme on Spike TV promo]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Comedy Central]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starwars.com/fans/media/20081002news.html Special "Atom TV" Episode Features the George Lucas 2008 Selects Winner, "Padmé"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009080358/http://starwars.com/fans/media/20081002news.html |date=2008-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly thereafter.

Robert Reeves previously won Best Comedy in the 2005 Star Wars Fan Film Awards for ''Cheap Seats'', which he wrote, directed, and starred in.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards|Official Star Wars Fan Films Award Winners]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The short is a virtual shot-for-shot remake of the [[teaser trailer]] for ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'', with the roles played by ''Star Wars'' characters. The film exploits the similarities between the characters of [[Padmé Amidala]] (from ''Star Wars'') and Juno MacGuff (from ''Juno''), two young women who find themselves unexpectedly pregnant. Both characters choose to give their children up for adoption and struggle with complex relationships with the children's fathers -- [[Anakin Skywalker]] filling the role of [[Paulie Bleeker]].

The mock trailer also showcases  parodies of two songs  featured in the Juno trailer:

"[[Anyone Else But You]]" by '''[[Moldy Peaches|The Moldy Peaches]]''' is spoofed as "Part-Time Jedi / Full-Time Sith."

And '''[[Mott the Hoople]]''''s "[[All the Young Dudes]]" is transformed into "All Jedi Dudes."

== Cast ==
'''[[Padmé]]''', played by '''Lisa Vendette''', takes on the role of '''[[Juno MacGuff]]'''.

'''[[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin]]''', '''[[Threepio]]''', and '''[[Yoda]]''', all played by '''Jason Ginsburg''', represent, respectively, '''[[Paulie Bleeker]]''', '''Leah''' (Juno's best friend), and the convenience store clerk played by '''[[Rainn Wilson]]'''.  Ginsburg also appears in a non-speaking capacity as '''[[Palpatine]]'''.

'''[[Mace Windu|Mace]]''', played by '''Gerald Webb''', acts as Juno's father, '''Mac MacGuff'''.

'''Vanessa''', played by '''Robin Johnstone''', is unique in that she is the only character who comes entirely from the Juno film with no Star Wars counterpart.

'''[[Bail Organa|Bail]]''', played by '''Robert Reeves''', parallels '''Mark Loring''', Vanessa's husband.  Reeves also provided the voice of Yoda, in much the same way that [[James Earl Jones]] voiced [[Darth Vader]] in combination with the physical performance of [[David Prowse]].

'''[[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan]]''', played by '''Kevin Walsh''', represents Juno's stepmother, '''Bren MacGuff'''.

'''Riley Rose Critchlow''' rounds out the cast in the capacity of a featured player.

An '''[[R2-D2]]''' toy also appears briefly as the nurse from ''Juno'', projecting a hologram of Padmé's ultrasound.

'''Pauline Fowler'''&lt;!-- Only credited names here, do not add Beale --&gt; is a fictional character from the [[BBC]] soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', a long-running serial drama about working class life in the fictional London borough of [[Walford]]. She was played by actress [[Wendy Richard]] between the first episode on 19 February 1985 and 25 December 2006.&lt;ref name="gone"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5165860.stm|title=Wendy Richard to leave EastEnders|publisher=BBC  |format=video|date=10 July 2006|accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauline was created by scriptwriter [[Tony Holland]] and producer [[Julia Smith]] as one of ''EastEnders' ''original characters. She made her debut in the soap's first episode on 19 February 1985, and remained for twenty-one years and ten months, making her the second longest-running original character, surpassed only by her nephew, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]).

Pauline is a member of the [[Beale family]]. Her storylines focus on drudgery, money worries and family troubles. The matriarchal stalwart of the fictional London community of [[Albert Square]], she is portrayed as a loving, doting mother who is very family-oriented. In later years however, she becomes a more stoic, opinionated battle-axe who alienates her relatives through overbearing interference. Pauline is married to the downtrodden [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]), though she finds out he has had a one-night stand with [[Christine Hewitt]] ([[Elizabeth Power]]) which leads to her hitting him with a frying pan. Their marriage remains rocky until his death in 1996. She is used for comedic purposes in scenes with her [[Self-service laundry|launderette]] colleague, [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]), and scriptwriters included many feuds in her narrative, most notably with her daughter-in-law, [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), and [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), a family friend who got her daughter, [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]), pregnant at 16. A famous episode in 1986, which includes Pauline discovering that Den is the father of Michelle's baby, drew over 30&amp;nbsp;million viewers, and was listed at number 36 in ''[[The Times]]''' 1998 list of "Top 100 cult moments in Film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Times]] (London)|date=14 February 1998|author1=Michaels, Ian |author2=King, Clive |author3=Humphries, Patrick |title=Top 100 cult moments|quote=*36 EASTENDERS When BBC1's new soap began in 1985, the marriage of Queen Vic publicans Den and Angie Watts was already on the rocks. Events came to a head in two episodes screened on Christmas Day in 1986. The afternoon segment saw Den hand divorce papers to Angie during the family's Christmas dinner. In the evening, 30&amp;nbsp;million viewers watched as Angie left the pub to spread Den's dirty deed, while Pauline Fowler discovered that Den was the father of her daughter Michelle's baby.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard announced Pauline's retirement from the serial in July 2006, and the character was killed off in a "[[whodunnit]]?" murder storyline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EastEnders set for another murder plot?|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0115/eastenders.html|work=RTÉ Entertainment|date=15 January 2007|accessdate=24 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Richard making her final appearance on 25 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vicar of Dibley tops Christmas TV viewing|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6209697.stm |location=UK|date=26 December 2006|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pauline was a staple in the UK press during her time in ''EastEnders'', representative of the symbiosis between Britain's soaps and tabloid newspapers. Widely read tabloids, such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', would routinely publish articles about forthcoming developments in Pauline's storylines.&lt;ref&gt;"Britain's tabloids and Britain's soaps feed off each other: newspapers publish articles about forthcoming developments in shows like "EastEnders" and viewers tune in to watch the prophecies come true." {{cite news|title=When the East End Marries Fleet Street, Tabloids Gloat|date=4 November 2005|author=Cowell, Alan|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical opinion on the character differs. She has been described as a "legend" and a [[Cultural icon|television icon]],&lt;ref name="stage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/07/a-raven-leaves-the-tower-walford-style/ |author=Wright, Mark |title=A raven leaves the tower—Walford style |work=[[The Stage]] |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128231335/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/07/a-raven-leaves-the-tower-walford-style/ |archivedate=28 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was also voted the 35th "most annoying person of 2006" (being the only fictional character to appear on the list).&lt;ref name="BBC Three"/&gt;  The character is well-known even outside of the show's viewer-base, and away from the on-screen serial, Pauline has been the subject of television documentaries, behind-the-scenes books, tie-in novels, and comedy sketch shows.

==Character creation==

===Background===
Pauline Fowler is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] (1940–2007)&lt;ref name=holland-obituary&gt;{{cite news|title=[Tony Holland] Co-wrote popular British soap opera|date=3 December 2007|work=[[The Courier-Mail|Courier Mail]] (Brisbane, Australia)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julia Smith]] (1927–1997). Holland had drawn on his own London background for inspiration, naming three of the original characters after his own relatives, specifically his aunt Lou and her children, Holland's cousins, the fraternal twins Pete and Pauline. This family setup of a woman named [[Lou Beale]], with twin children [[Pete Beale|Pete]] and Pauline, was recreated on-screen as the first family of ''EastEnders'', [[Beale family|the Beales and Fowlers]].&lt;ref name="insidestory"&gt;''EastEnders: The Inside Story'', pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Pauline's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appears in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]''.

{{quote|[[Pete Beale|Pete]]'s twin sister. Forty, and a chip off the [[Lou Beale]] block. Plucky, and determined to battle through whatever the odds. A warm, practical, unsophisticated woman: you stand by your man, do your duty, fight for your kids and have a roast for [[Sunday dinner]]&amp;nbsp;... She's also pregnant&amp;nbsp;... She actually remembers her dad [Albert] saying "Two things we don't discuss in this house are religion and politics". She also remembers her dad smoked a pipe, and wishes her husband did too. She loved her dad very much&amp;nbsp;... Maybe she didn't go into her marriage with quite the right spirit? She was due to be chief bridesmaid at her sister's wedding but she'd got the flu and was confined to bed. Arthur, someone she'd known from school, was given permission to visit the invalid upstairs. He found himself proposing to her. Years later he said "It was to cheer her up really." And Pauline found herself accepting too&amp;nbsp;... She's very fond of her twin brother, Pete (and knows that he's mum's favourite). She's very conventional, and the salt of the earth. Jolly, rounded, someone you can get your arms round. She doesn't trust skinny people.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Julia; Holland, Tony pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Casting===
[[Image:PAULINE333.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Pauline Fowler as she appeared in 1985]]
From the beginning, Smith considered the role ideal for [[Wendy Richard]], with whom she had worked on the 1960s BBC soap, ''[[The Newcomers (TV series)|The Newcomers]]'';&lt;ref name="insidestory2"&gt;Smith, Julia; Holland, Tony pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Richard has claimed the part was created especially for her.&lt;ref name="titbits"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pages.prodigy.net/glc/wrhp/html/wr_wat85.htm |title=Heartbreak Behind Wendy's TV Role|author=Milton, Geoffrey|work=Weekend and Titbits|date=14 May 1996|accessdate=29 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Holland and Smith decided to approach her about the role, even though their casting policy was not to use "stars"—Richard was already well known in the UK for playing glamorous roles, such as [[List of Are You Being Served? characters#Miss Shirley Brahms|Shirley Brahms]] in the successful sitcom ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' At their first meeting, Tony Holland informed Richard that they were planning a programme that would not "duck social issues but would be a hard-hitting drama including teenage pregnancy, drugs, racial conflict, prostitution, rape, mental illness, homosexuality, alcoholism, and muggings among its subjects." In order to carry such controversial storylines, Richard was told that "powerful characters to whom things just naturally happened" had been invented, and two families, the Fowlers and the Beales, were to form the core of the soap's narrative. In her autobiography, Richard states, "If I accepted, my character was to be Pauline Fowler. A middle-aged mother of two teenagers, with a late baby on the way, Pauline worked part-time at the launderette, voted [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and supported [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. She was married to Arthur, who was out of work and was really a bit of a failure, not much good at anything in life." Richard thought it sounded like a challenging role.&lt;ref name="casting"&gt;Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

There were initial fears that Richard's glamorous image would not work for the character and Smith also feared that Richard would be apprehensive about playing Pauline, who would be anything but glamorous, but these fears were swept aside when Richard announced that she was sick of glamour and wanted to play her own age.&lt;ref name="insidestory2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7118974.stm|title=EastEnders creator Holland dies|publisher=BBC News  |date=29 November 2007|accessdate=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard has commented, "although it would be such a huge transformation of my screen image, it was after all my twenty-fifth year in showbusiness, and I'd realised that I couldn't go on playing dolly birds forever&amp;nbsp;... I knew right away I would be mad to turn down the part of Pauline."&lt;ref name="casting"/&gt;

After she accepted the role, Richard was told by Julia Smith that she would have to change her appearance, to make it more in keeping with Pauline's unglamorous lifestyle. This included having her hair cut. Richard has commented, "I was very proud of my long hair, which had taken me years to grow. I hadn't had it cut short for nineteen years but reluctantly, I agreed&amp;nbsp;... I cried my eyes out for the rest of the day after that traumatic hair cut."&lt;ref name="casting1"&gt;Wiggins, Lizzie, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt; From September 1984, Richard was involved in pre-production of the series, covering every angle, from hair, costume design and make-up to organising the set interior of her character's screen house. Richard has said that Pauline had been given extensive biographical detail, including minute specifics, such as her fictional time of her birth: "It was vital that we should get to know our own characters intimately and so the cast initially sat together in family groups to learn our lines and bond with our 'relations'&amp;nbsp;... it was essential to develop the rapport that families, who'd been together for years, would naturally have."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Wiggins, Lizzie, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's casting was considered to be "a giant leap of faith" by co-creators Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately "landed on its feet",&lt;ref name="insidestory2"/&gt; because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in ''EastEnders''' history,&lt;ref name=gone/&gt; remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.

==Character development and impact==

===Lineage and personality===
The character of Pauline was a cornerstone of ''EastEnders''; the [[linchpin|lynchpin]] of the Fowler/Beale family around whom the soap was originally structured. At the beginning of the serial in 1985, Pauline was a 40-year-old married mother with two teenage children, [[Mark Fowler|Mark]] and Michelle, and another child on the way. The fictional history of her younger years has been told via behind-the-scenes books such as ''EastEnders: The Inside Story'', and the second tie-in novel by Hugh Miller, ''Swings and Roundabouts'', which explains that Pauline was born and raised at 45 Albert Square, where she lived for her entire life. She married Arthur Fowler in 1965, raising her own children in the same house where she grew up.&lt;ref&gt;''Swings and Roundabouts'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas most of the other female characters in ''EastEnders'' were portrayed in a somewhat more glamorous working class way, Pauline Fowler was the exception to the rule, being the sole character to represent the "homely and domestic" side of the Beale family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Come on Down?: Popular Media Culture in Post-war Britain|author1=Strinati, Dominic |author2=Wagg, Stephen |chapter=From the East End to ''EastEnders''|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1992|isbn=0-415-06326-4|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the serial progressed, the character altered from her original outline. Instead of being the jolly, warm character she was during the show's early years, she became a sombre battle-axe,&lt;ref name=tee/&gt; hardened by a life of misery in Albert Square.&lt;ref name="guardianculture"/&gt; Other characters refer to her as "Fowler the growler",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-139393186.html|title=Ian Hyland: Nickname of the week|work=Sunday Mirror|date=4 December 2005|accessdate=30 March 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ''Evening Gazette'' she was described as "the [[Boadicea]] of battle-axes."&lt;ref name="tee"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://icteesside.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/columnists/mondayinterview/tm_objectid=15205494&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50080&amp;headline=star-looks-back--name_page.html|title=Star looks back|work=Evening Gazette|date=18 February 2005|accessdate=3 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial change in her demeanour is traced back to the death of her mother, [[Lou Beale]] ([[Anna Wing]]), a fierce dowager, who ruled over her family with a "rod of iron".&lt;ref name="20years5"&gt;''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Following Lou's screen funeral in July 1988, Pauline retorts, "Shut up Arthur Fowler, no one interrupts Pauline Beale when she's in full flow," a line that was used similarly by Lou in the episode that preceded her own death. This parallel symbolised the transference of the family's [[matriarch]]al role from Lou to Pauline.&lt;ref name="july1"&gt;''EastEnders'' airdate 28 July 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="july2"&gt;''EastEnders'' airdate 26 July 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Richard has indicated that both she and show creator, Julia Smith, had always intended for Pauline to become like her mother,&lt;ref name="anniversary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DSdisappointed"/&gt; and former ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] has commented on the importance of the lineage between the two characters: "[Pauline] endures, stoically and heroically, whatever life may throw at her, just as her mother did before her. This sense of lineage is vitally important, too. Pauline has been in the show since its start and was handed the role of matriarch on Lou Beale's death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,721140,00.html|title=Queen of all soaps|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=24 May 2002|author=Yorke, John|accessdate=12 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early storylines===
In the first episode, it is revealed that Pauline, aged 40, is pregnant with her third child. The character's pregnancy quickly became a prominent storyline within the series. Pauline, against her mother's opposition, is determined to keep the baby.&lt;ref&gt;Brake, Colin, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline was used to spread a public message on the increased risk of genetic defects in late pregnancies, with Pauline undergoing [[amniocentesis]] tests.&lt;ref name="biog"&gt;Wiggins, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline culminates with the birth of the serial's first baby, [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]], in July 1985.

Pauline's early storylines concentrate on family and money troubles: coping with her husband Arthur's redundancy, mental breakdown and imprisonment; eldest son Mark's delinquency; and daughter Michelle's teenage pregnancy.

{{Quote_box |width=48% |align=right|quote="Pauline was suffering from ill health&amp;nbsp;... It was at this stage of the storyline in 1989 that an attempt was made to write [Pauline] out of ''EastEnders'' all together&amp;nbsp;... I was pretty pissed off&amp;nbsp;... Rumours circulated that some of us were to be replaced and I never really felt secure until [executive producer] Michael Ferguson took over."|source=—Wendy Richard&lt;ref name="axing"/&gt;}}
In 1989, the character was used to highlight another important gynaecological health issue, [[fibroma|fibroids]].&lt;ref name="first10"&gt;Brake, Colin, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline sees Pauline ignoring health problems, such as chronic fatigue, and using [[Homeopathy|homoeopathic preparations]] rather than seeking medical assistance. Her fibroids are discovered by chance, when the character [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) knocks her down in his [[Austin Mini]]. In the 1989 [[Boxing Day]] episode, Pauline spends time in hospital, recovering from a necessary [[hysterectomy]]. Wendy Richard has since revealed that the storyline had originally been scripted differently. Before the outcome of Pauline's illness was screened, producers had decided that the character was to be killed off with cancer. This was a decision that had been made by the show's boss, [[Mike Gibbon]], to refresh the format by replacing some of the serial's older characters. The scriptwriters went as far as giving Pauline a mystery illness. The newly appointed executive producer, [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], decided to scrap the original storyline, believing that Pauline, as one of the soap's original characters, was too valuable an asset to lose. The storyline was rewritten and the character was given a different gynaecological ailment that was treatable.&lt;ref name="axing"&gt;Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage to Arthur===
Pauline's marriage to the luckless [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]] is central to her character, remaining one of her defining traits even after his death in 1996. The dynamics of the relationship were clear from the beginning of the programme, with Pauline depicted as the matriarchal force that holds the Fowler family together, while Arthur is depicted as weak, emotionally unstable and easily dominated by the stronger females of his family. Writer [[Jacquetta May]], who once played [[Rachel Kominski]] in the programme, has commented that "[Pauline and Arthur] represented the matriarchal relationship of strong woman/weak man&amp;nbsp;... Arthur, only sporadically employed and disabled by a breakdown, often behaved like a little boy, while Pauline had to make the decisions and keep the family functioning in the face of poverty and unemployment, teenage pregnancy and depression."&lt;ref name="kominski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html |title=Square deal|publisher=redpepper.org|accessdate=27 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061229113716/http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html |archivedate = 29 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pauline and Arthur were generally seen as the most stable couple in the show, so Arthur's [[adultery|affair]] with [[Christine Hewitt]] ([[Elizabeth Power|Lizzie Power]]) came as a shock to viewers.&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;Brake, Colin, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline was long-running, beginning early in 1992 with the introduction of lonely divorcee Christine, who employs Arthur to tend to her garden. A romance between Arthur and Christine steadily develops throughout the year, facilitated by Pauline's lengthy absence—she is called abroad to tend to her crippled brother [[Kenny Beale|Kenny]] in early June, and she does not return until late September—in reality, Wendy Richard had to be temporarily written out of ''EastEnders'' to allow her to act in ''[[Grace and Favour]]''.&lt;ref name="grace"&gt;Brake, Colin, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The build-up to the affair contains many twists and turns, starting with Arthur's rebuff of Christine's advances, then a confrontation between Pauline and Christine, which convinces Pauline of Arthur's innocence and leaves her feeling "strangely sorry for the pathetic, lonely figure, who obviously drank too much".&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The episode in which Arthur finally gives into temptation and sleeps with Christine aired on Christmas Eve 1992;&lt;ref name="grace"/&gt; it was labelled "The Bonk of the Year" by the British press, and was watched by 24.3&amp;nbsp;million viewers. In 2005, it was reported as the eleventh most highly viewed UK television programme of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The biggest TV audience ever&amp;nbsp;... it is now|author=Tapper, James |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=346942&amp;in_page_id=1773|work=Daily Mail |location=UK|date=1 May 2005|accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline continued throughout 1993 as Christine makes greater demands on Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair unless he does so himself. In September 1993, the situation finally reaches a climax on-screen.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would find out about the affair; "should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?"&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; In the end it was felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he does, Pauline becomes violent and hits him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this was something different, "an act of betrayal on a massive scale."&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Series production manager, Rona McKendrick, has commented on this "iconic" scene: "It was one of the few times when you saw Pauline really, really let rip&amp;nbsp;... you really felt the anger, understood the anger and realised why she went as far as she did."&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt; This episode (written by [[Tony McHale]] and directed by [[Keith Boak]]) was chosen by writer [[Colin Brake]] as the episode of the year in ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The First Ten Years]]''&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; and is described by Wendy Richard as "Pauline's crowning moment."&lt;ref name="tee"/&gt;

For a while it seems that ''EastEnders''' "most solid" marriage is over,&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; but Arthur spends the rest of 1993 trying to convince Pauline that it is worth saving and they eventually reconcile.&lt;ref&gt;Brake, Colin, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; However, more tragedy follows, when Arthur is framed by a conman, [[Willy Roper]] (dubbed "Wicked Willy" by the British press),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61168406.html|title=Wicked Willy and his friend carry on up the Nile|work=Sunday Mirror|author=Rice, Dennis|date=5 May 1996|accessdate=30 March 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrongfully imprisoned for embezzlement in 1995. The storyline captured the public's imagination and a nationwide "Free Arthur Fowler" campaign was launched. "Arthur Fowler Is Innocent" T-shirts were produced and a single was even released in the [[UK singles chart]] promoting the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61275849.html|author=Low, Bob|title=The Net; My little Willy is on the Web|work=Daily Record|location=Scotland|date=23 May 1996|accessdate=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur's imprisonment was a precursor to the final exit of actor [[Bill Treacher]], who decided to leave ''EastEnders'' after 11 years playing Arthur. While Arthur goes to pieces in prison, Pauline is heavily embroiled in the storyline pertaining to his eventual release. For several months viewers witnessed Willy attempt to woo Pauline, but she eventually uncovers his deception and then resorts to uncharacteristic [[seduction]] to gain his confession. A critic for the ''Sunday Mirror'' commented, "Pauline Fowler deserves a Golden Cardie Award for her performance in ''EastEnders''. The way which she extracted a confession from Willy Roper over the money he stole was nothing short of brilliant."&lt;ref name="confess"&gt;{{cite news|work=Sunday Mirror|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61179137.html|title=Pauline's one jumper ahead |date=12 May 1996|accessdate=30 March 2012 | first=Pam | last=Francis}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur is exonerated, but his joyful reunion with Pauline is brief, as an injury he sustained in prison leads to a [[Cerebral haemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]] and he dies shortly after his release. His death ends an 11-year screen marriage, the longest run of any marriage in the serial.

===Importance of family===
Pauline remains a family-oriented character throughout the course of the show. A "fiercely loyal, but overbearing mother";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/11/broadcasting.bbc?INTCMP=SRCH|author=Stuart, Michael|title=Pauline to leave EastEnders|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=11 July 2006|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; sheltering and taking on the major responsibilities of her children and frequently stressing the importance of family.&lt;ref name="kominski"/&gt; She is portrayed as a traditionalist, with strict rules and beliefs—the first to criticise, but also the first to defend her children, often interfering in their issues and causing rifts in their relationships. The quintessential matriarch, she has also been compared with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]], with the storylines in the fictional Albert Square, mirroring the troubles of England as a whole.  In ''Monarchies: What Are Kings and Queens For'', the author points out similarities between the matriarchal nature of Pauline's character, and that of the Queen. "Both exhibit a rich mix of suffering and duty.  Pauline has tried to bring up her family as best she can, even though it hasn't always been easy.  Her offspring have caused her nothing but trials and tribulations; her husband has been wayward at times and caused her several eyebrow-raising moments.  But Pauline has steadfastly carried on&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;''Monarchies'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Early storylines between Pauline and her two teenage children, Mark and Michelle, show her to be a doting mother, forgiving of Mark's wayward behaviour, and supportive when Michelle decides to become a teenage mum. Pauline is devoted to her twin brother [[Pete Beale|Pete]], dutiful to her mother [[Lou Beale|Lou]], allegiant to her husband Arthur, and a shoulder for her nephew, [[Ian Beale|Ian]], to cry on. Wendy Richard commented in 1990, "It's important for her to keep the family together. That's why when her problem son Mark suddenly came home [in 1990], it was like her winning the [[Football pools|pools]] ... She had to take a lot of shocks from Michelle and I think she coped remarkably well."&lt;ref name="salt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pages.prodigy.net/glc/wrhp/html/wr_rt9012.htm |title=Pauline is the Salt of the Earth |author=Kingsley, Hilary |work=[[Radio Times]] |accessdate=20 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419054241/http://pages.prodigy.net/glc/wrhp/html/wr_rt9012.htm |archivedate=19 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the serial progressed, Pauline contends with a plethora of family upsets, which include many deaths—her mother Lou in 1988, brother Pete in 1993 and husband Arthur in 1996—as well as her elder son [[Mark Fowler|Mark's]] fatal battle with HIV. After a year long build-up, Mark is shown to reveal his HIV status to his stunned and devastated parents in an episode that aired on [[Boxing Day]] 1991, attracting 19&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name="xmas90s"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61168061.html|title=Misery, mayhem and murder&amp;nbsp;... it's Christmas|work=Sunday Mirror|accessdate=30 March 2012|date=1 December 1996|author=Rowe, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Richard has given her interpretation of Pauline's reaction to Mark's news: "To say she was shell-shocked was an understatement and, not knowing enough about HIV, she and Arthur were worrying that their eldest son might die from AIDS at any moment."&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The HIV plot had many ramifications for the character of Pauline, as she struggles to come to terms with her son's condition. It was also instrumental in raising public awareness about the illness, which was still the subject of much ignorance when ''EastEnders'' tackled it in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ww2.aegis.org/news/bbc/2005/BB050401.html |author=Triggle, Nick |title=How well does TV and film tackle disease? |publisher=BBC News |date=3 April 2005 |accessdate=12 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091846/http://ww2.aegis.org/news/bbc/2005/BB050401.html |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the storyline initially aired, more people went for a [[HIV test]] in Britain than at any other time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2006/10/02/hjuniord02.xml&amp;sSheet=/health/2006/10/06/ixhfeatures.html|author=Pemberton, Max|title=Trust me, I'm a junior doctor: is the truth stronger in fiction?|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=2 October 2006|accessdate=12 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Richard commented: "The storyline with Mark Fowler, when he announced he was HIV positive, was really well done. People have to be aware that HIV and AIDS are not exactly the same thing. The Minister of Health who was in power at that time wrote a letter complimenting us for the way that we had put the information across."&lt;ref name="tee"/&gt;

The HIV storyline came to an end on-screen in 2003, when executive producer [[Louise Berridge]] decided to axe Mark Fowler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_2092000/2092429.stm|title=EastEnders' Mark Fowler axed from show |publisher=BBC |date=4 July 2002|accessdate=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the serial, Mark discovers his HIV medication is failing, but instead of allowing Pauline to witness his deterioration, he leaves to spend the remainder of his life travelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2580435.stm|title=EastEnders' Mark to be killed off|publisher=BBC |date=16 December 2002|accessdate=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: "I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying—but everybody said I acted it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because I was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go."&lt;ref name="tee"/&gt; Mark, who had appeared intermittently for 18 years, was eventually killed off-screen in 2004, dying of an AIDS-related illness.

In the latter years of her time in the soap, Pauline changes from a caring mother into a more inflexible battle-axe.&lt;ref name=tee/&gt; Pauline's relationship with Martin is often shown to be strained by Pauline's refusal to release control over his life. Though initially a teenage delinquent, following Mark's death in 2004, Martin becomes Pauline's "dutiful son", forced to put his mother's wishes above those of his wife—a recurring theme within the serial. Eventually, this causes a rift between the two characters. When Martin goes against his mother's wishes in 2006 and rekindles a romance with his adulterous ex-wife Sonia, Pauline cuts him out of her life. Television personality [[Paul O'Grady]] addressed Pauline's refusal to "share her son like a normal mother", commenting, "she's suspicious of anybody that comes into the family who wants to take her son away from her. She has already lost one son; she has lost her husband, so she's hanging onto the last [son] like a mother tiger with her cub."&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt;

===Friends and enemies===
The character's narrative also included various feuds, most notably with the soap's [[lothario]] [[Den Watts]], a family-friend who gets Pauline's daughter Michelle pregnant at the age of 16. ''EastEnders'' pulled in the biggest television audience of the 1980s when over 30&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bad News at the BBC|date=25 October 2007|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Mayer, Catherine|url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1675379,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; people watched the 1986 Christmas Day episode in which Pauline discovers that Den is the father of her granddaughter, [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/830756741.html?dids=830756741:830756741&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT|author=McLaughlin, Aideen|title=The nation's favourite TV moment|work=The Sunday Herald|date=1 May 2005|accessdate=29 March 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Richard has commented on the hostility between the characters "once Pauline realised that Dennis was Vicki's father, she was out to get him one way or another" and actor [[Leslie Grantham]], who played Den, added "from then on it was out and out war, which was great!"&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt; An array of confrontations between Den and Pauline occur, as she tries to force him to leave Walford and keep him away from her family. The feud appears to end in 1989 when the character Den is shot and presumed dead, but it is ignited once again in 2003 when Den is re-introduced, 14 years after he supposedly died. 2005 saw Den killed off for the final time, and although Pauline is not directly responsible for killing him, the item used to bludgeon him to death turns out to be her dog-shaped iron doorstop, which has been described as "a nice touch of pathos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EastEnders|url=http://aerialtelly.co.uk/eastenders.php|publisher=aerialtelly.co.uk|accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Square-eyed vision&amp;nbsp;– EastEnders|url= http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/7414|work=[[The Stage]]|date=19 April 2005 |accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large proportion of the character's scenes take place on the set of Walford's launderette, where Pauline works as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in ''EastEnders''.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/characters/character_pauline_f.shtml|title=EastEnders character Pauline Fowler|publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/the-ender-pauline-1-2081279|title=The ender Pauline|work=Yorkshire Evening Post|author=Hazan, Sophie|date=11 December 2006|accessdate=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Pauline is frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, [[Dot Cotton]]. The two characters share one of the soap's most enduring screen friendships and their scenes together are often used to provide humour.&lt;ref name="tee"/&gt; Particular emphasis is placed on their differences, which lead to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 sees them "buried alive" underneath a collapsed fairground ride, in the midst of a cake-selling war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jun/25/television.artsfeatures|author=Banks-Smith, Nancy|title=Fairground extraction |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=25 June 2004|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pauline and Dot are most frequently shown [[gossip]]ing, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette. The duo has been described by television personality [[Paul O'Grady]] as a "fabulous double-act": "Dot's probably Pauline's one and only confidant. Pauline eventually will break down and tell Dot things that she'd never tell anybody else."&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt;

Pauline is shown to be particularly hostile to the various female characters that feature in her sons' lives, and she epitomises the [[archetype|archetypal]] "mother-in-law from hell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisischeshire.co.uk/archive/2005/07/25/Cheshire+Archive/5328706.Sharon_searches_for_her_dad/|title=Sharon searches for her dad|publisher=thisischesire.co.uk|date=25 July 2005|accessdate=29 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052433/http://www.thisischeshire.co.uk/archive/2005/07/25/Cheshire+Archive/5328706.Sharon_searches_for_her_dad/|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Pauline's most notable feuds is with her youngest son Martin's wife, [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]]. Animosity between the characters begins in 2000, when Sonia gives birth to Pauline's grandchild and decides to give the baby [[Rebecca Miller (EastEnders)|Chloe]] (later renamed Rebecca) up for adoption. In the storyline, Pauline tries unsuccessfully to fight for custody, leading Sonia to retort "YOU want to bring up Chloe? You couldn't bring up phlegm!"&lt;ref&gt;''EastEnders'', airdate 11 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The feuding over Chloe is revisited in storylines throughout 2005 and 2006, when first Pauline is shown to visit her adopted granddaughter against Sonia and Martin's wishes, and then, following Sonia's affair with [[Naomi Julien]], Pauline refuses to give Sonia access to the child after Martin regains custody. Critic for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Grace Dent]], commented "At one point, you couldn't move around Walford for hitmen and gangsters, but now they've all been written out&amp;nbsp;... leaving Pauline Fowler to reign the square like [[Sod (vulgarity)|sodding]] [[Pablo Escobar]] in a sky-blue tabard and ski-pants, decreeing who can see their own kids, who can drink where and what everyone's eating in the cafe so as they won't spoil their teas. If I was Sonia, I'd have ransacked the hospital's dangerous drugs box by now and given that old crone a renal meltdown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguide/columnists/story/0,,1841359,00.html|title=World of lather|author=Dent, Grace|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=12 August 2006|accessdate=12 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various rows, slaps and insults were featured between the characters, caused by Pauline's continuous interference in Sonia's relationships with Martin and Rebecca. As Martin began to cede, allowing Sonia access to their daughter, Pauline was shown to concoct ever more elaborate ways to obstruct Sonia's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20060808.shtml|title=EastEnders Tue 8 Aug 2006|publisher=BBC  |accessdate=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her latter years in ''EastEnders'', Pauline is rarely without her [[Cairn Terrier]], Betty. The dog is a stray taken in by the Fowler family in 2004, who quickly becomes Pauline's inseparable sidekick. Wendy Richard has since revealed that it was her decision for Pauline to own a Cairn: "When EastEnders asked if Pauline should have a dog I said it had to be a Cairn Terrier—and Betty joined us!  She's wonderful, she loves me and I love her."&lt;ref&gt;(13 January 2006) "Real Lives:  'Dogs For Disabled Children Are Vital" [[All About Soap]] magazine, pp.5, 10, 12, 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; In the on-screen story, the dog is named after Pauline's aunt Betty, but in reality, Wendy Richard named her after [[Mollie Sugden]]'s fictional character [[Mrs. Betty Slocombe|Betty Slocombe]], who appeared along with Richard's Shirley Brahms in the sitcom, ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/cast/cast_betty_.shtml|title=EastEnders character Betty|publisher=BBC  |accessdate=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second marriage===
Several eligible bachelors are shown to express their interest in Pauline over the years, including the characters [[Derek Taylor (EastEnders)|Derek Taylor]] in 1987, [[Danny Taurus]] in 1993, [[Jeff Healy (EastEnders)|Jeff Healy]] (who proposes) in 1999, [[Eddie Skinner (EastEnders)|Eddie Skinner]] in 2000, and [[Terry Raymond]], with whom she goes on a blind date in 2001.&lt;ref name="22 May 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20010522.shtml#3|title=Episode guide—22 May 2001|publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the character remains staunchly faithful to her late husband's memory, refusing to let the relationships progress beyond companionship. In 2001 [[Derek Harkinson]] ([[Ian Lavender]]) is introduced, an old school friend of Pauline's. Initial scripts indicated that Derek was being groomed as a romantic interest for Pauline, which she is shown to welcome. However, the storyline takes a twist when he reveals, to her shock, that he is [[homosexuality|gay]].&lt;ref name="18 December 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20011218.shtml#4|title=Episode guide—18 December 2001|publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2002 sees Derek move in with the Fowler family, unconventionally settling into the show as a replacement father figure for Mark and Martin and as Pauline's best friend. &lt;!-- Due to the similarities in their domestic setup, Pauline and Joe have been described as a "geriatric [[Will &amp; Grace]]" (a homosexual male and heterosexual female who are the lead characters in a popular US sitcom).&lt;ref name="Queeraswalford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wgazette.com/aut03-queer.html|title=Queer As Walford: How Gays Are Portrayed on EastEnders|publisher=BBC |accessdate=9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

In 2005, Pauline embarks on a romance with a new character, [[Joe Macer]] ([[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]]), whom she meets at [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]] classes. A relationship develops, and despite her initial trepidation, Pauline remarries in 2006, after almost a decade alone. Pauline's marriage to Joe was an attempt to give the character a "new lease of life", and her wedding day was screened to coincide with ''EastEnders''' 21st anniversary.&lt;ref name="anniversary"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1710666,00.html|title=In the early days all I ever got were crying scenes|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=16 February 2006|accessdate=3 June 2007  | first=Emma | last=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled, successfully, for Pauline to keep the "Fowler" surname.&lt;ref name="anniversary"/&gt; However, in July 2006, [[Wendy Richard]] announced that she was leaving ''EastEnders''; she quit due to "creative differences" with the show's producers regarding Pauline's remarriage, which she felt was "disloyal" to her character's beloved first husband, Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=394994&amp;in_page_id=1773&amp;in_page_id=1773&amp;expand=true|title=After 21 years, Pauline leaves the misery of Albert Square|work=Daily Mail |location=UK|date=11 July 2006|accessdate=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview in ''The Sun'', Richard commented, "I think it's the most terrible shame, I really do. I thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong&amp;nbsp;... I just couldn't believe that Pauline would remarry—anybody&amp;nbsp;... I would have stayed a bit longer if Pauline hadn't got married."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/58608/Wendy-Why-I-quit-Enders.html|author=Nathan, Sara|title=Wendy: Why I quit Enders|work=The Sun|accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard felt that she did not have the same chemistry with [[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]], who played Joe, as she did with [[Bill Treacher]], who played Arthur. She refuted producers' opinions that Pauline and Joe "looked good together" and felt that she and Brooks had to work very hard to turn them into a "realistic-looking couple."&lt;ref name="evening"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/1083/I-quit-EastEnders-because-I-felt-betrayed,-says-Wendy|title= I quit EastEnders because I felt betrayed, says Wendy|work=[[Sunday Express]]|date=7 August 2006|accessdate=9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the storyline, just two months after the wedding, Pauline's marriage is shown to sour after she discovers Joe's criminal past. Their relationship steadily deteriorates throughout the year, and in December 2006 Pauline ends the marriage—removing her wedding ring and informing Joe that he "was half the man that Arthur had been, that she had never really loved him and that their sex life was a sham." The resulting row sees Joe insult Pauline's family—suggesting that her "perfect marriage" with Arthur was "nothing but a fantasy" and branding Mark "diseased", Michelle a "scrubber" and Arthur a "con"—to which Pauline responds by smashing a plate over his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20061221.shtml#2|title=''EastEnders'' episodes: "Stacey gets dumped"|publisher=BBC |date=21 December 2006|accessdate=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Richard commented, "It was not just the memory of Arthur that stopped the marriage to Joe being a success. He was proven to be a weak and untruthful man. That is what caused the marriage to be a non-starter. Pauline was not mean to Joe, he used her&amp;nbsp;... and lied to her."&lt;ref name="dsinterview"/&gt;

===Deception, reclusiveness and death===
Viewers saw the slow build-up to Pauline's climactic exit throughout the latter part of 2006. The character's bitter decline involves depression, pretending to have a [[brain tumor|brain tumour]] to scupper the revived relationship between her son [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] and his ex-wife [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]], marital breakdown, and finally [[ostracism]] after Martin and the rest of Albert Square discover her lie. Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline plans to go to America to join her daughter. Wendy Richard commented on the reasons behind Pauline's actions: "she cannot forgive. For anyone to hurt a member of her family so badly is incomprehensible to Pauline. She is a good, but unforgiving woman. Sonia is more than just a thorn in Pauline's side. She is angry because she feels Martin has let her down in returning to Sonia. She feels he could have discussed it with her more and talked her round for the sake of Rebecca. Pauline will blame her decision to leave on Sonia—another way of punishing Martin. Even though she is really hurting over leaving Rebecca, Pauline is determined to go. She realised she never really loved Joe, he has lied to her too many times&amp;nbsp;... Although I know Pauline better than anyone, even I cannot fathom out why she made up the brain tumour story."&lt;ref name="dsinterview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a40799/wendy-richard.html|author=Green, Kris|title=Wendy Richard|work=Digital Spy|date=23 December 2006|accessdate=12 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character was killed off in a dramatic storyline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/primetime/british_soap_awards |title=British Soap Awards |publisher=whatsontv.co.uk |accessdate=18 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822154826/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/primetime/british_soap_awards |archivedate=22 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which aired on Christmas Day 2006 and was watched by an estimated 10.7&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Geraldine's prayers answers|date=28 December 2006|work=[[Herald Sun]] (Melbourne, Australia)|author=Galer, Kit}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second most highly watched programme of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=424848&amp;in_page_id=1773|author=Revoir, Paul|title=BBC1 posts its worst Christmas Day ratings ever|work=Daily Mail |location=UK|date=26 December 2006|accessdate=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode sees Sonia denouncing Pauline as "sick" for not wanting to share her son with the woman he loved, to which Pauline retorts, "I'll tell you what's sick. You. Daughter of a scrubber, lesbian, under-age mother who gave away her own baby."&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; The row culminates with Sonia slapping Pauline, causing her to fall to the floor and break the Fowler fruit bowl—"the enduring symbol of her family, which smashed, significantly, into smithereens."&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; Though Pauline resolves to stay and reunite with her family in the end, she does not get the chance, as she collapses and dies in the middle of Albert Square, leaving both characters and viewers in uncertainty about the cause of her demise.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

The Christmas Day episodes, written by [[Simon Ashdown]], drew on the show's early history to mark the occasion of Pauline's exit, which was particularly emphasised by the use of flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family. The critic for ''[[The Times]]'', Tim Teeman, commented that "Wendy Richard as Pauline had the air of the departing diva, queen of all she had loved, lost and laid waste to, her face set in a silent snarl." In addition, her parting scene with the other ''EastEnders'' long-serving "grand dame" Dot Cotton (played by [[June Brown]]) has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: "The really choking scene came in the launderette between Pauline and Dot&amp;nbsp;... Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved."&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

Richard herself has been less complimentary about her alter ego's departure. She has spoken of her disappointment regarding Pauline's "changing character" and "depressing final storyline". In an interview with the [[The Biography Channel|Biography Channel]] she explained: "I did say, promise me you won't make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did&amp;nbsp;... I wasn't too happy with the way it was done. They were changing Pauline's character&amp;nbsp;... Pauline would never have remarried. She would have remained a widow, sitting in that chair in the corner. That's what [show creator] Julia Smith wanted, and that's what I felt was right, so I resigned&amp;nbsp;... I think it's a shame because the Fowlers have gone completely now&amp;nbsp;... There was so much history with that family."&lt;ref name="DSdisappointed"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Gloria's Greats: Wendy Richard |series= Gloria's Greats|network=[[The Biography Channel]] |station=[[British Sky Broadcasting]]|airdate=20 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This included Martin, Sonia, and Joe, who is dramatically killed off after confessing to Pauline's murder, by falling out of the Fowlers' first floor window while trying to apprehend a hysterical Dot. Pauline is cremated, and her ashes buried at Arthur's graveside, by Dot, in an episode that aired in June 2007.&lt;ref name="ashes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20070612.shtml#2|title=Tue 12 Jun 2007|publisher=BBC |accessdate=2 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a final tribute to Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special television programme, ''[[EastEnders Revealed]]: Goodbye Pauline'', which provided an emotional look back at Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates [[Todd Carty]] and [[James Alexandrou]] (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and ''EastEnders'' actors such as [[Anna Wing]] and [[Pam St. Clement]] (Lou and [[Pat Butcher|Pat]]).&lt;ref name="EErevealed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/display.var.1097748.0.eastenders_revealed_goodbye_pauline_bbc1.php|title=EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, BBC One|work=This Is Lancashire|date=2 January 2007|accessdate=3 January 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927172125/http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/display.var.1097748.0.eastenders_revealed_goodbye_pauline_bbc1.php| archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how "proud" she was of her character, commenting: "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems&amp;nbsp;... She wasn't always grumpy&amp;nbsp;... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame&amp;nbsp;... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she ever thought about was her family. That was the most important thing in her life."&lt;ref name="revealed"&gt;{{cite episode |title=EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline |series=EastEnders Revealed |serieslink=EastEnders Revealed |credits= Including [[Wendy Richard]], [[Todd Carty]], [[Paul O'Grady]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=BBC One |location=UK|airdate=1 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
At the time of her departure from the serial, Pauline was the second-longest running character to feature in ''EastEnders'' and one of only two original characters to remain in the show for almost 22 years. Her baggy woolly cardigan and long-suffering nature have led to her being labelled as a soap institution,&lt;ref name=palace&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1044603.stm|title=EastEnder Pauline's Palace date|publisher=BBC |date=28 November 2000|accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "soap legend" and a "television icon".&lt;ref name="stage"/&gt; Actress Wendy Richard was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire]] MBE medal in 2000 by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] at [[Buckingham Palace]],&lt;ref name=palace/&gt; and when the Queen visited the set of ''EastEnders'' in 2001, Wendy Richard was the first actress introduced, who then accompanied her and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] on their tour of the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Queen steps into EastEnders set|date=29 November 2001|work=[[Daily Telegraph]] (Sydney)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being popular with many, the character of Pauline has also garnered much criticism over the years. Persistent criticism has been given to the character's dowdy attire, particularly the perception that she rarely wears anything but a baggy cardigan;&lt;ref name="stage"/&gt; a claim that Wendy Richard herself categorically disputes.&lt;ref name="revealed"/&gt; In addition, Pauline has also received much criticism for her miserable demeanour—"a face like a month of wet weekends" and "a voice that could curdle milk."&lt;ref name="ukgold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uktv.co.uk/gold/item/aid/528050|title=EastEnders|work=[[UKTV Gold]]|accessdate=3 January 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002045350/http://uktv.co.uk/gold/item/aid/528050|archivedate=2 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been described as the "Wicked Witch of Walford"&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/article1264418.ece|title=Eastenders—Tim Teeman watching BBC One|work=The Times |location=London |date=26 December 2006|accessdate=3 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "a character who became a byword for downtrodden haggery."&lt;ref name="guardianculture"&gt;{{cite news|author=Lucy Mangan |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/culturevulture/archives/2006/07/11/post_113.html|title=Bye Then, Pauline|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=11 July 2006|accessdate=3 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucy Mangan, the culture critic from ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, summed up the character: "Pauline Fowler is surely one of the oddest soap creations ever. She is a character without humour, charisma or indeed any redeeming features who became progressively, unrelentingly miserable&amp;nbsp;... She was presumably intended to be the anchoring force for ''EastEnders'', but because of the writers' unprecedented decision to break with traditional narrative rules and give her not a single redeeming feature, she became more of a sucking chest wound than the heart of the show."&lt;ref name="guardianculture"/&gt; This opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers, as Pauline was voted the 35th most annoying person of 2006 in a [[BBC Three]] poll, being the only fictional character to appear on the list.&lt;ref name="BBC Three"&gt;{{cite AV media| title = The Most Annoying People of 2006 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0931335/ | publisher = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC Three]] | location = London, England | airdate = 27 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Radio Times]] poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 13% chose Pauline Fowler as the soap character they would most like to see retired. She came third in the poll, behind ''EastEnders''' [[Den Watts]] (17%) and ''[[Coronation Street]]'s'' [[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Ken Barlow]] (15%).&lt;ref name="retiredpoll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/hilda-ogden-voted-the-best-1115410 |title=Hilda Ogden voted the best |work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |date=13 July 2004 |accessdate=10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it had been suggested that Pauline's presence in ''EastEnders'' was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure in 2006 was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike.&lt;ref name="soaplife"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5166062.stm|title=Wendy Richard's dramatic soap life|publisher=BBC |date=10 July 2006|accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report for [[BBC News]], one viewer commented "it's so sad, because I've watched her for 20 years. She's such a large character", and another said "If she goes then I think ''EastEnders'' is finished."&lt;ref name="bbcnewsclip"/&gt; BBC controller of continuing drama, [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]], commented Richard "occupies a huge place in people's hearts",&lt;ref name="gone"/&gt; and executive producer [[Kate Harwood]] said, "For many years Wendy simply was ''EastEnders'' for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the ''EastEnders''' spirit&amp;nbsp;... We thank her for everything she has done for the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/07_july/11/richard.shtml|title=Wendy Richard MBE to leave EastEnders|publisher=BBC |date=11 July 2006|accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Inside Soap]]'' editor, Steven Murphy, said that the fact Pauline has been such an "enduring staple" will make it hard for fans to cope with her departure. "It's huge in soap terms&amp;nbsp;... She's a character people love to hate—you just assumed she would be there forever."&lt;ref name="soaplife"/&gt; When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: "characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. In terms of that [EastEnders] has very few of those now."&lt;ref name="bbcnewsclip"/&gt; Jonathan Hughes, editor of ''[[All About Soap]]'' magazine, added "[Pauline's] an absolute legend&amp;nbsp;... You can't imagine the show without her&amp;nbsp;... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of ''EastEnders'' for so many years."&lt;ref name="soaplife"/&gt; However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting "How can you have someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [getting rid of her]. Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago".&lt;ref name="bbcnewsclip"/&gt;

Pauline's exit in December 2006 was described by ''The Times'' critic, Tim Teeman, as a landmark episode and a "significant sayonara". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as "the most moving in a soap this year" and added that "it was a delight to finally alight on an episode&amp;nbsp;... that was so satisfying."&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; Conversely, Pauline's exit was described as a "mess" by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline.

To mark Pauline's 22-year reign in ''EastEnders'', Wendy Richard was awarded with a 'Lifetime Achievement' award at the [[British Soap Awards]] in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.co.uk/news/tm_headline=what-a-kym-back-&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=19206609&amp;siteid=93463-name_page.html |author=Swan, Melanie |title=British Soap Awards 2007 Special |work=The People |date=27 May 2007 |accessdate=20 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209002408/http://www.people.co.uk/news/tm_headline%3Dwhat-a-kym-back-%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D19206609%26siteid%3D93463-name_page.html |archivedate=9 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was presented by [[Todd Carty]], who played her on-screen son Mark. Carty described Richard as the "heart and soul of ''EastEnders''" and hailed her as an inspiration to everyone in the ''EastEnders'' cast.&lt;ref name="award1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=457959&amp;in_page_id=1773|title=Corrie sweeps the board at soap awards|work=Daily Mail |location=UK|date=28 May 2007|accessdate=27 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard was moved to tears when she collected the award.&lt;ref name="award2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?in_article_id=50712&amp;in_page_id=7&amp;in_a_source= |title=Wendy moved by 'long service' award|work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]|date=27 May 2007|accessdate=27 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture and other media==
When the series was launching in 1985, since Wendy Richard was the most recognisable actor from the original cast, she and her character Pauline were used heavily to promote ''EastEnders'' in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, Lizzie, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Richard, in character as Pauline, was chosen to narrate a special "dial-a-soap" service for ''EastEnders''. Run by [[British Telecom]], the facility allowed people who had missed an episode to ring a number and get an instant update, up to 88 seconds long. It was the first television show to provide such a service.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Julia; Holland, Tony p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1985 and 2006, Pauline was featured in much ''EastEnders''-related merchandise and promotional material, including calendars, cast-cards, annuals, novels, a knitting pattern book and a greeting card.&lt;ref name="EEbook"&gt;''[[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders Special]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known character of Pauline Fowler has also been referenced in various television programmes, unrelated to the ''EastEnders'' universe. In 1997 she was mentioned in an episode of the successful BBC drama ''[[This Life (1996 TV series)|This Life]]''. Two key characters, Anna and Ferdy, watch an episode of ''EastEnders'' on television and mock Pauline's hysterics and her well-documented tendency to wear cardigans.&lt;ref name="thislife"&gt;{{cite episode |title=This Life |series= This Life |serieslink=This Life (1996 TV series) |credits= Including [[Daniela Nardini]], [[Andrew Lincoln]], [[Ramon Tikaram]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]]|date=17 March – 7 August 1997|season= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was also regularly spoofed in the BBC comedy sketch show, ''[[The Real McCoy (TV series)|The Real McCoy]]'' (1991–1995). One of the show's recurring sketches featured a spoof version of ''EastEnders'', with [[black (people)|black]] comedians taking over roles of well known ''EastEnders'' characters, who frequent a pub called Rub-a-Dub. The comedian Llewella Gideon played the role of Pauline. The sketches placed considerable emphasis on the character's high-pitched voice and her tendency to whine.&lt;ref name="rub"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Real McCoy |series= The Real McCoy|serieslink=The Real McCoy (TV series) |credits= Including Llewella Gideon, [[Meera Syal]], [[Felix Dexter]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]]|airdate=2 February 1996|season= 6|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's fashion sense has also been referred to in [[BBC Two]] sitcom ''[[Beautiful People (UK TV series)|Beautiful People]]'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=How I Got My Vase|series= Beautiful People|serieslink=Beautiful People (UK TV series)|credits= Including [[Luke Ward-Wilkinson]], [[Olivia Colman]], [[Meera Syal]], [[Layton Williams]] |network=[[BBC]] |station=BBC Two |location=UK|airdate=2 October 2008|season= 1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Six Flags over Texas Emblems under State Capitol Dome.jpg|thumb|right|Six coats of arms displayed under the Texas State Capitol Dome]]
"'''Six flags over Texas'''" is the [[slogan]] used to describe the '''six''' nations that have had sovereignty over some or all of the current territory of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]: Spain (1519–1685; 1690–1821), France (1685–1690), Mexico (1821–1836), the [[Republic of Texas]] (1836–1845), the [[Confederate States of America]] (1861–1865), and the [[United States]] of America (1845–1861; 1865–present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/sixflags.html | title=Six Flags of Texas | publisher=Texas State Library and Archives Commission | accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This slogan has been incorporated into shopping malls, theme parks ([[Six Flags]]), and other enterprises. In Austin, the six flags fly in front of the [[Bullock Texas State History Museum]]; the [[Texas State Capitol]] has the six coats of arms on its northern facade, and the [[University of Texas at Austin]] Life Sciences Library, previously the location of the central library in the [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)|Main Building]], has each coat of arms displayed in plaster emblems with short excerpts representative of the constitutions of each country. The six flags are also shown on the reverse of the [[Seal of Texas]].

In 1997 the [[Texas Historical Commission]] adopted standard designs for representing the six flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth176676/m1/89/ |date=June 20, 1997 |journal=Texas Register |volume=22 |pages=5959–67 |title= Recommended Historic Designs: The "Six Flags Over Texas" |author=Texas Historical Commission |publisher=[[Texas Secretary of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain (1519 to 1685; 1690 to 1821)==
{{Main article|Flag of Spain|Flag of Castile and León}}
&lt;div style="float: left;padding:5px"&gt;[[image:Royal Banner of the Crown of Castille (Habsbourg Style).svg|border|100px]]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="float: left;padding:5px"&gt;[[image:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|border|100px]]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="float: left;padding:5px"&gt;[[File:Flag of Spain (1785-1873 and 1875-1931).svg|border|100px]]&lt;/div&gt;

The first [[flag]] belonged to [[Spain]], which ruled most of Texas from 1519 to 1685 and 1690 to 1821. There were three [[Flag of Spain|Spanish flags]] used during this period: the "castle and lion" arms of the [[Crown of Castile]] (see [[Flag of Castile and León]]); the [[Cross of Burgundy]], a military and maritime flag also used by the viceroys of [[New Spain]]; and the ''Rojigualda'' introduced by [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] in 1785, containing horizontal stripes of red-gold-red and the simple arms of Castile and León.  This third flag has been used by Spain in various forms to the present day, and is the flag used in the reverse of the [[Seal of Texas]] and adopted by the [[Texas State Historical Commission]].&lt;ref name="6Flags"&gt;[http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/sixflags.html Texas State Library – Six Flags of Texas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="6Flags2"&gt;[http://www.lsjunction.com/facts/6flags.htm The Six National Flags of Texas]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==France (1684 to 1690 for Fort Saint Louis and 1800 to 1803 as French Louisiana)==
{{Main article|Bourbon royal standard}}
&lt;div style="float: left;padding:5px"&gt;[[image:Pavillon royal de France.svg|border|100px]]&lt;/div&gt;

The second flag was the royal banner of the [[Kingdom of France]] from 1684 to 1690.  In 1684, French nobleman [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]], founded a colony on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Texas Gulf Coast]] called [[Fort Saint Louis (Texas)|Fort Saint Louis]]. The colony was unsuccessful, and after La Salle's murder, was soon abandoned. During this time, there was no official [[Flag of France|French flag]], so a number of designs are used in displays of the "six flags".&lt;ref name="6Flags" /&gt;&lt;ref name="6Flags2" /&gt;
{{clear}}

Later on in 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France under the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. French Louisiana included northern sections of Texas. It remained in the hands of France until 1803, when France [[The Louisiana Purchase|sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States]]. However, what would later be northern Texas was sold back to Spain years later.

==Mexico (1821 to 1835)==
{{Main article|Flag of Mexico}}
&lt;div style="float: left;padding:5px"&gt;[[File:Flag of Mexico (1823-1864, 1867-1893).svg|border|100px]]&lt;/div&gt;
The third flag flown (1821 through 1836) was the [[flag of Mexico]]. [[Mexican Independence|Mexico's independence]] was recognized by Spain in 1821. The Mexican flag displayed in the [[Austin]] Capitol is the one of the Mexican Republic of 1823 through 1864.

This flag was in use in Texas until its independence from Mexico in 1836 (Texas' [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]]).&lt;ref name="6Flags" /&gt;

==Republic of Texas (1836 to 1845 as the Republic of Texas; since 1845 as the State of Texas)==
{{Main article|Flag of Texas}}
&lt;div style="float: left;padding:5px"&gt;[[File:Flag of Texas.svg|border|100px]]&lt;/div&gt;

The fourth flag belonged to the [[Republic of Texas]] from 1836 to 1845.  The Republic had two national flags during its history, the first being the so-called "[[Flag of Texas#The Burnet Flag|Burnet Flag]]". The "[[Flag of Texas|Lone Star Flag]]", the final [[national flag]], became the [[federated state|state]] flag when Texas joined the United States as a [[U.S. state]] in 1845.&lt;ref name="6Flags2" /&gt;
{{clear}}

==United States of America (1845 to 1861; 1865 to present)==
{{Main article|Flag of the United States}}
&lt;div style="float: left;padding:5px"&gt;[[File:Flag of the United States (1846-1847).svg|border|left|100px]]&lt;/div&gt;

The fifth and current flag is that of the [[United States|United States of America]], which Texas joined in 1845. Upon [[Ordinance of Secession|secession]] Texas abandoned this flag for its sixth, until readmission to the Union in 1865.&lt;ref name="6Flags2" /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Confederate States of America (1861 to 1865)==
{{Main article|Flags of the Confederate States of America}}
&lt;div style="float: left;padding:5px"&gt;[[File:CSA FLAG 4.3.1861-21.5.1861.svg|border|100px]]&lt;/div&gt;

The sixth flag belonged to the [[Confederate States of America]] from 1861 to 1865. During this time, the Confederacy had [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|three national flags]].&lt;ref name="6Flags" /&gt;&lt;ref name="6Flags2" /&gt;

[[File:Argenteuil Basilique Saint-Denys 561.JPG|thumb|200px|Spur on column base, Basilica Saint-Denys, France.]]
A '''spur''' (French ''griffe'', German ''Eckblatt''), in architecture, is the ornament carved on the angles of the base of early [[column]]s.

==Ornament==
A spur consists of a projecting claw, which, emerging from the lower torus of the base, rests on the projecting angle of the square [[plinth]].

==Ancient Roman architecture==
It is possibly to these that [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] refers (Hist. Nat. XXVI. 42) when speaking of the lizard and frog carved on the bases (''spirae'') of the columns of the temples of Jupiter and Juno in the Portico of Octavius; the earliest known example is that of Emperor [[Diocletian]]'s palace at [[Split (city)|Split]]. 

In [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] work the oldest examples are those found on the bases in crypts, where they assumed various conventional forms; being, however, close to the eye, the spur soon developed into an elaborate leaf ornament, which in French 13th-century work and in the early English period is of great beauty; sometimes the spur takes the form of a fabulous animal, such as a [[griffin]].

==Design==
The theater was designed in the 1860s by [[Juan Bertoli Calderoni]] (a [[List of people from Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponceño]] of [[Italian people|Italian]] heritage resident of the city) and it bears a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] structure with an impressive six-column entrance. The building was badly damaged by the [[1918 San Fermín earthquake|1918 earthquake]]. However, it was rebuilt in 1940 using the original plans and reopened in 1941 with better acoustics technology. It closed in 2006 for renovations and reopened on March 14, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsgotoponce.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=202&amp;Itemid=81 ''Grand Inauguration for Ponce’s La Perla Theater.'' LetsGoToPonce: Insider's Guide to South Puerto Rico.] Retrieved April 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Teatro La Perla was built under the initiative of [[Francisco Parra Duperón]] and Pedro Garriga in May 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Acosta  | first = Ivonne | title = Teatro La Perla  | language = Spanish | publisher = Fundación Puertorriqueña de las Humanidades | date = September 29, 2008| url = http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=06121001 | accessdate = March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was inaugurated on 28 May 1864 with the play ''La campana de la Almudaina'' of the [[Majorca]]n writer Juan Palou y Coll by the [[theatrical company]] of Segarra &amp; Argente.&lt;ref&gt;Socorro Girón.

Registration Number: TX-1-977-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teatro La Perla served as a stage not only to give life to the theatrical artistic culture in the region, but it also served as a place of assembly for those who were dedicated to the social issues in Ponce and in Puerto Rico as a whole.   It served this function both at the end of the Spanish regime and in Puerto Rico’s early years as a United States territory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090831091422/http://www.tourism-puerto-rico.com/citys-and-towns/ponce/ Functional Use of the Theater]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this theater, in 1901, Frenchman Eduardo Hervet showed the first [[silent film]] ever to be run in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="HPR"&gt;[http://www.cinemovida.net/historia_del_cine_en_puerto_rico Historia del Cine en Puerto Rico]&lt;/ref&gt; The theater's first illumination technical director was Félix Juan Torres Ortiz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5846:a-punto-de-caramelo-el-festival-de-teatro-luis-torres-nadal&amp;catid=119:articulos&amp;Itemid=342 ''Llega Festival de Teatro Luis Torres Nadal .''] Sandra Torres Guzmán. La Perla del Sur. Ponce, Puerto Rico. Year 32. Issue 1577. Page 24. 19 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was reconditioned between 1977 and 1979 at a cost of over $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;Carmelo Rosario Natal. ''Ponce En Su Historia Moderna: 1945-2002.''  Published by Secretaría de Cultura y Turismo of the Government of the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce. Ponce, Puerto Rico. 2003. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Capacity and museum==
The theatre has a [[seating capacity]] of 1,047 and it is now a regular venue for [[concerts]], [[opera]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]], and various civic and educational activities such as school graduations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsgo.com/14330-puerto_rico-travel-guides-southeast-ponce-c Let's Go:Home &gt; North America &gt; Puerto Rico &gt; Southeast &gt; Ponce : ''Sights.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204180256/http://www.letsgo.com/14330-puerto_rico-travel-guides-southeast-ponce-c |date=4 December 2010 }} Retrieved April 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The lobby of the theater has a small [[museum]] dedicated to the history of the building and past shows.

'''Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas''' are decorative, utilitarian, ceremonial, or conceptual artworks made from [[fiber crop|plant]], [[animal fiber|animal]], or [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] [[fiber]]s by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|native peoples of both North and South America]].

[[Textile arts]] and [[fiber arts]] include [[fabric]] that is flexible woven material, as well as [[felt]], bark cloth, knitting, embroidery,&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Gibbs 1&lt;/ref&gt; featherwork, [[skin-sewing]], [[beadwork]], and similar media. Textile arts are one of the earliest known industries.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; [[Basketry]] is associated with textile arts.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 6&lt;/ref&gt;

While humans have created textiles since the dawn of culture, many are fragile and disintegrate rapidly. Ancient textiles are preserved only by special environmental conditions. The oldest known textiles in [[the Americas]] is some early fiberwork found in [[Guitarrero Cave]], Peru dating back to 10,1000 to 9,080 BCE.&lt;ref name=carbon&gt;Stacey, Kevin. [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-04/uocp-cdi041311.php "Carbon dating identifies South America's oldest textiles."] ''University of Chicago Press Journals.'' 13 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known textiles in [[North America]] are [[twine]] and [[plain weave]] fabrics preserved in a [[peat]] pond at the [[Windover Archaeological Site]] in [[Florida]], the earliest dating to 6,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spike|first=Tamara|title=Review of Doran, Glen H., ed., Windover: Multidisciplinary Investigations of an Early Archaic Florida Cemetery.|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=7863|publisher=Humanities and Social Sciences Online|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andes===
{{Main|Andean textiles}}
[[File:Inca Quipu.jpg|thumb|An [[Inca]] [[quipu]], or textile recording device]]
As previously mentioned, fragments of rope and textiles dating back between 12,100 and 11,080 years ago have been unearthed from [[Guitarrero Cave]] in Peru.&lt;ref name=carbon/&gt; Because of the extremely dry conditions of the desert sands, twined textiles from the [[Norte Chico civilization]] in Peru have survived, dating back to 2500-1800 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Stone-Miller 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton and wool from alpaca, llamas, and vicuñas have been woven into elaborate textiles for thousands of years in the Andes and are still important parts of Quechua and [[Aymara people|Aymara]] culture today. Coroma in [[Antonio Quijarro Province]], [[Bolivia]] is a major center for ceremonial textile production.&lt;ref&gt;Siegal 15&lt;/ref&gt; An Aymara elder from Coroma said, "In our sacred weavings are expressions of our philosophy, and the basis for our social organization... The sacred weavings are also important in differentiating one community, or ethnic group, from a neighboring group..."&lt;ref&gt;Siegal 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Aguayo (cloth)|Aguayo]]s are clothes woven from camelid fibers with geometric designs that Andean women wear and use for carrying babies or goods.

===Circum-Caribbean===
[[File:KunaWomanWithMolas.jpg|thumb|Kuna woman with [[Mola (art form)|molas]], [[San Blas Islands]], [[Panama]].]]
[[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] tribal members of [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]] are famous for their [[Mola (art form)|mola]]s, cotton panels with elaborate geometric designs created by a reverse [[appliqué]] technique. Designs originated from traditional skin painting designs but today exhibit a wide range of influences, including [[popular culture|pop culture]]. Two mola panels form a blouse, but when a Kuna woman is tired of a blouse, she can dissemble it and sell the molas to art collectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panart.com/molainfo.htm About Molas.] ''Indigenous Art from Panamá.'' (retrieved 28 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesoamerica===
{{Further|Maya textiles}}
Mayan women have woven cotton with backstrap looms for centuries, creating items such as ''[[huipil]]s'' or traditional blouses. Elaborate [[Maya textiles]] featured representations of animals, plants, and figures from oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Geise, Paula. [http://www.mythinglinks.org/Geise~MayanWeaving.html Clothing, Regalia, Textiles from the Chiapas Highlands of Mexico.] ''Mything Links.'' 22 December 1999 (retrieved 28 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, weaving serves as both an art form and a source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Ashley E.|last2=Greenfield|first2=Patricia M.|last3=Childs|first3=Carla P.|date=1999|title=Culture, History, Biology, and Body: Native and Non-Native Acquisition of Technological Skill|jstor=640594|journal=Ethos|volume=27|issue=3|pages=379–402}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizing into weaving collectives have helped Mayan women earn better money for their work and greatly expand the reach of Mayan textiles in the world.

===Southeastern Woodlands===
Pieces of 7,000- to 8,000-year-old [[textile|fabric]] have been found with human burials at the [[Windover Archaeological Site]] in Florida. The burials were in a [[peat]] pond. The fabric had turned into peat, but was still identifiable. Many bodies at the site had been wrapped in fabric before burial. Eighty-seven pieces of fabric were found associated with 37 burials. Researchers have identified seven different weaves in the fabric. One kind of fabric had 26 strands per inch (10 strands per centimeter). There were also weaves using two-strand and three-strand [[weft]]s. A round bag made from [[twine]] was found, as well as [[matting]]. The [[yarn]] was probably made from palm leaves. [[Sabal palmetto|Cabbage palm]], [[saw palmetto]] and [[Sabal etonia|scrub palmetto]] are all common in the area, and would have been so 8,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Robin C.|title=Florida's First People: 12,000 Years of Human History|year=1994|publisher=Pineapple Press|location=Sarasota, Florida|isbn=1-56164-032-8|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milanich|first=Jerald T.|title=Archaeology of Precolumbian Florida|year=1994|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1273-2|pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seminole patchwork shawl.jpg|thumb|[[Seminole patchwork]] shawl made by Susie Cypress from [[Big Cypress Indian Reservation]], c. 1980s]]
[[Seminole]] seamstresses, upon gaining access to sewing machines in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, invented an elaborate appliqué patchwork tradition. Seminole patchwork, for which the tribe is known today, came into full flower in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Blackard, David M. and Patsy West. [http://www.seminoletribe.com/culture/clothing.shtml Seminole Clothing: Colorful Patchwork.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316140336/http://www.seminoletribe.com/culture/clothing.shtml |date=2008-03-16 }} ''Seminole Tribe of Florida.'' (retrieved 11 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northeastern Woodlands===
Great Lakes and Prairie tribes are known for their [[ribbonwork]], found on clothing and blankets. Strips of silk ribbons are cut and appliquéd in layers, creating designs defined by negative space. The colors and designs might reflect the clan or gender of the wearer. [[Powwow]] and other dance regalia from these tribes often feature ribbonwork. These tribes are also known for their [[Fingerweaving|fingerwoven]] sashes.

Experimental contemporary textile artists include Martha Gradolf ([[Ho-Chunk]]), whose work addresses historic injustices against native peoples,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Rachel. [http://www.ourbrowncounty.com/1202s3.htm Martha (Marty) Gradolf: Idea Weaver.] ''Our Brown County.'' (retrieved 28 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marie Watt]] ([[Seneca Nation|Seneca]]), who creates installations and interactive artworks using blankets as a metaphor.

===Oasisamerica===
[[Pueblo]] men weave with cotton on upright looms. Their mantas and sashes are typically made for ceremonial use for the community, not for outside collectors.

[[Navajo rug]]s are woven by Navajo women today from [[Navajo-Churro sheep]] or commercial wool. Designs can be pictorial or abstract, based on traditional Navajo, Spanish, Oriental, or Persian designs. 20th century Navajo weavers include [[Clara Sherman]] and [[Hosteen Klah]], who co-founded the [[Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian]].

(retrieved 28 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and Melissa Cody ([[Navajo people|Navajo]]) explore non-representational abstraction and use experimental materials in their weaving.

===Northwest coast===
{{Further|Salish weaving}}
[[File:Chilkat blanket univ alaska museum.jpg|thumb|Chilkat blanket in the collection of the [[University of Alaska Museum of the North]], [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]]]
Traditional textiles of Northwest Coast tribes are enjoying a dramatic revival. [[Chilkat weaving]] and [[ravenstail]] weaving are regarded as some of the most difficult weaving techniques in the world. A single Chilkat blanket can take an entire year to weave. In both techniques, dog, mountain goat, or sheep wool and shredded cedar bark are combined to create textiles featuring curvilinear [[formline design]]s. [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] weaver [[Jennie Thlunaut]] (1892–1986) was instrumental in this revival.

[[Button blanket]]s are wool blankets embellished with mother-of-pearl buttons worn on significant occasions, such as [[potlatch]]es.

'''Texture gradient''' is the [[distortion]] in size which closer objects have compared to objects farther away. It also involves groups of objects appearing denser as they move farther away. Also could be explained by noticing a certain amount of [[Complexity|detail]] depending on how close something is, giving a sense of [[depth perception]].
There are three main forms of texture gradient: [[density]], [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], and [[distortion (optics)|distortion]] of [[wikt:texture|texture]] elements.

Texture gradient is carefully used in the painting ''[[Paris Street, Rainy Day]]'' by [[Gustave Caillebotte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psych.hanover.edu/krantz/art/texture.html "Vision and Art: Texture Gradient"], John H. Krantz, Ph.D., [[Hanover College]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Texture gradient was used in a study of child psychology in 1976&lt;ref&gt;Degelman, D., &amp; Rosinski, R. R., [http://www.vanguard.edu/Psychology/PsychAbstractInfluenceoffemalebodyimagesin/PsychAbstractTexturegradientregistrationand/tabid/1088/Default.aspx "Texture gradient registration and the development of slant perception"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617195323/http://www.vanguard.edu/Psychology/PsychAbstractInfluenceoffemalebodyimagesin/PsychAbstractTexturegradientregistrationand/tabid/1088/Default.aspx |date=2010-06-17 }}, ''Journal of Experimental Child Psychology'', 21, pp339-348. Retrieved 2010-2-15.&lt;/ref&gt; and studied by Sidney Weinstein in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Weinstein, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1419453 ''The Perception of Depth in the Absence of Texture-Gradient''], Vol. 70, No. 4 (Dec., 1957), pp. 611-615, University of Illinois Press. Retrieved 2010-2-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a paper about the texture gradient equation, [[wavelet]]s, and shape from texture was released by [[Maureen Clerc]] and [[Stéphane Mallat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink1 = Maureen Clerc | first1 = Maureen | last1 = Clerc | authorlink2 = Stéphane Mallat | first2 = Stéphane | last2 = Mallat | citeseerx = 10.1.1.7.2677 | title = The Texture Gradient Equation for Recovering Shape from Texture | journal = [[IEEE]] Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Face In the Window" by [[Heather Graham Pozzessere|Heather Graham]]===
A dangerous storm rips through Florida, where an evacuation notice has been spread throughout part of the state. Beth Henson, a woman whose husband, Keith has been sent to rescue an elderly woman, stays in her house during the evacuation progress. A man stumbles in seeking shelter, but Beth suspects that he is a serial killer. Keith enters the elderly woman's home, only to find that she is unconscious inside the trunk of her car. A youth found around the woman's house claims to be her nephew; Keith also suspects that he is a serial killer. Back in the house, Beth attacks her guest with a frying pan. She flees to the shed where the youth catches her, holding a knife to her neck. Keith arrives at the house and whilst searching for the youth, bumps into the man who was hit by a frying pan. Keith locks him in a room and exits to the shed. The three enter the house where the man ambushes them and takes Beth hostage. Beth retaliated and attacked the man again with a frying pan, leaving him unconscious.

==="Empathy" by [[James Siegel]]===
The author, whose name is unmentioned, has an affair with a hotel masseuse, Kelly. Kelly tells him she is an empath, someone who can sense one's emotions by touch. She also tells him of a man in whom she sensed a very strong evil, and that the man is a pedophile. The author is very moved, because he feels responsible for his younger brother's suicide, because the narrator had not said anything about the pedophile priest who, it is implied, abused both of them. He seeks out the man Kelly mentioned, and after killing him, meets with a friend of Kelly's, who informs the narrator that Kelly was divorced, was a drug addict, and had poisoned her son against his father. The narrator, realizing he had killed Kelly's innocent ex-husband, set out to kill Kelly and avenge the man he had wrongfully killed. In the end it is implied that the author commits suicide.

==="Kowalski's In Love" by [[James Rollins]]===
Seaman Joe Kowalski swims onto a small island after his boat is accidentally blown up by a gas leak. He is met by Dr. Shay Rosauro, who informs him that the island is infected with a [[transgenic rhabdovirus]] and is scheduled to be bombed by the Brazilian Navy at 0900 hours—in less than half an hour. Shay had entered the island to retrieve the only antidotes to the virus; an evac helicopter  will pick her up at 0855 hours. However, the island is scattered with booby traps, and it isn't long until Shay falls into one, breaking her leg. Kowalski offers to retrieve the antidotes himself, whilst Shay makes for the evac dropsite. Shay reluctantly agrees but becomes treed by apes on her way. Kowalski encounters Gabriella Salazar, who has already collected the antidotes. Kowalski shoots and killed Gabriella in self-defense and retrieves the antidotes. Kowalski could escape on the evac chopper, but opts not to, as it will lift off the island on schedule, with or without Shay. Kowalski rescues Shay, and they escape on the water vehicle that was meant for Gabriella.

Dmitri Garnitsky is on the hitlist of a professional assassin, the Carnivore, who has a reputation for never failing.

The Carnivore is angered by Olenkov's demands and shoots him in the chest, leaving Dmitri unharmed. Many years later, Olenkov catches up with the Carnivore's daughter, Liz Sansborough, a psychologist. Masquerading as "Arkady Albam", Olenkov befriends Sansborough, lures her to his apartment, and tells her a false story of how he got shot. He ultimately reveals himself to be Olenkov, and moments later Dmitri enters the apartment, shocked that his attempted killer is there. The three of them engage in a violent struggle, resulting in one of their being rendered unconscious and harmless.

Maura sneaks into the Meadows' household, hoping to rescue her son. After witnessing Audra being verbally abused and then raped by her husband, Alec, Maura searches the house without success. Maura visits another property, this one owned by A.R. Meadows, only to find the property is owned by ''Ambrose'' Meadows. Maura then goes in search of Dr. Simon Rubenstein, the psychiatrist who had prescribed Audra's pills. Maura then discovers that Audra had threatened Maura's son's life herself, unbeknownst to Alec, believing that if she were disfigured, Alec would reject her, and then she'd be free from his mental and sexual abuse. Just before the surgery, Maura and Dr. Rubenstein confront Audra.

'''Young Playwrights' Theater''' (YPT) is a [[not-for-profit]] [[theater]] [[arts]]-based [[education]] [[organization]] in [[Washington, D.C. (northwest)|Northwest]] [[Washington, D.C.]]. It provides interactive in-school and after-school programs presenting and discussing student-written work to promote community dialogue and respect for young artists. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youngplaywrightstheater.org/About/GuidingPrinciples/index_E.html |title=YPT Vision and Mission   |publisher=Young Playwrights' Theater }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Leadership==
Young Playwrights' Theater was founded in 1995 by Karen Zacarías. Now a [[Helen Hayes]] Award-winning Playwright-in-Residence at [[Arena Stage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arenastage.org/new-play-institute/playwright-residencies/ |title=Playwright Residencies   |publisher=Arena Stage }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zacarías began volunteering her time teaching playwriting workshops in DC classrooms after returning to her hometown with a M.F.A. in [[playwriting]] from Boston University. By 1997, her workshops were so successful that she incorporated YPT as a [[501c3]] nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/Jan06/zacarias.cfm  |title=Karen Zacarias: A Writer's Tightrope    |publisher=Theatre Communications Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, when Zacarías transitioned to Arena Stage, David Andrew Snider took over as Producing Artistic Director and CEO. Since then the organization has grown to employ six full-time staff members, eight professional [[teaching artists]], and dozens of professional actors, directors and designers supporting its work on-stage and in the classroom. YPT provides thousands of students and community members annually with free in-school and after-school theater arts workshops and professional performances of student-written plays, and has created a continuum of programming at the [[Columbia Heights (Washington, D.C.)|Columbia Heights]] Education Campus through programming for students of Bancroft Elementary School, Lincoln Middle School and [[Bell Multicultural High School]] to gauge the long-term effects on students as they progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2012/06/01/gJQAlmp7BV_story.html|title=Nonprofit's turnaround has brought it lots of attention   |publisher=The Washington Post | first=Vanessa|last=Small|date=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snider followed Zacarías to Arena Stage in July 2012 as Director of Artistic Programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchengine.com/arenastageatthemeadcenterforamericantheater/david-snider-to-join-arena-stage-as-director-of-artistic-programming |title=David Snider to Join Arena Stage as Director of Artistic Programming   |publisher=www.pitchengine.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Deputy Director Brigitte Pribnow Moore stepped in as Acting Executive Director and former Program Manager Nicole Jost assumed the role of Associate Artistic Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.georgetown.edu/scs/prcc/224264.html  |title=MPS PR/CC Student Implements Class Project and Exceeds $50,000 Fundraising Goal    |publisher=Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/blogarticles/21083.html |title=Our List of Women to Watch   |publisher=The Washingtonian }}&lt;/ref&gt; YPT's staff operates out of the [[Josephine Butler Parks Center]], adjacent to [[Meridian Hill Park]] in the Columbia Heights neighborhood and regularly stages performances at nearby [[Tivoli Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Tivoli Theatre]], a renovated 1920's Italian Renaissance Revival theater, now home to [[GALA Hispanic Theatre]]. The organization receives federal and private sector funding, as well as individual donations.

==Programs and Performance Series==

===''In-School Playwriting Program''===
YPT's flagship program integrates the art of playwriting into the classroom in order to enhance student literacy, creative expression and communication. During 12 in-class workshops led by teaching artists, students explore the mechanics of language, drama, and self-expression, culminating with each student writing his or her own short play. Professional actors and directors visit the classroom throughout the process, reading students' plays and helping to bring their words to life. The most dynamic plays are chosen by a reading committee composed of professional playwrights, directors, and actors, to be performed at Tivoli Theatre by YPT's acting company in the '''''New Play Festival''''' and at satellite locations during the '''''New Writers Now!''''' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2012/04/26/ypts-new-play-festival-young-playwrights-turn-life-into-plays/|title=YPT's New Play Festival: young playwrights turn life into plays   |publisher=DC Theatre Scene }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/video/#!/on-air/as-seen-on/Stupid-Cupid--The-Ugly-Side-of-Valentines-Day/139264198 |title=Stupid Cupid: The Ugly Side of Valentine's Day   |publisher=NBC 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The young authors work with a dramaturge to polish their scripts, attend rehearsals, and offer input to actors and a director during their plays' development and production. In 2012, YPT published some of the best student works.

===''Out-of-School Time Programming''===
Since 2008, YPT has hosted an after-school '''''Young Playwrights' Workshop''''' at its facilities in the Josephine Butler Parks Center, aimed at developing students' creative expression and collaboration by exploring theater as an ensemble. Students have written plays and performed them at the [[Capital Fringe Festival]], [[Intersections (arts festival)|Intersections]] at [[Atlas Performing Arts Center]], the [[Source Festival]] and Tivoli Theatre. The workshop hosted arts delegations from China and Russia in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/therootdc/post/dc-students-write-original-play-at-the-young-playwrights-workshop/2012/06/08/gJQAZi3AOV_blog.html|title=D.C. students write original play at The Young Playwrights' Workshop    |publisher=The Washington Post | first=DeNeen|last=Brown|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several schools host YPT's '''''After-School Playwrighting Program''''', providing a similar collaborative, explorative writing and performance experience. Additionally, the '''''Summer Playwriting Series''''', a series of playwriting workshops for local youth, is conducted at partner schools, camps and community centers, culminating in community sharing and staged readings.

===''Express Tour''===
Each fall, YPT's professional acting company tours the Greater Washington, D.C. area performing student-written plays at schools, nursing homes, hospitals, community centers and theaters, free of charge. Plays are selected from the previous school year to align with an overarching theme chosen for that year's tour. Audiences participate with actors in post-performance interactive workshops to develop their own artistic interpretations and customized storytelling experiences. The tour usually concludes with a public showcase performance at Tivoli Theatre.

===''Special Projects''===
YPT has received commissions and enjoyed partnerships with regional and international institutions including the [[White House Historical Association|White House]], [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]], [[National Geographic Society]], [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institution's Discovery Theater]], [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], [[Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company|Woolly Mammoth]], [[Carnegie Institution of Washington|Carnegie Institute]], [[Theater J]], [[Round House Theatre]], [[African Continuum Theatre Company|African Continuum]], [[Busboys and Poets]], [[Washington Parks and People]], [[Capitol Hill Arts Workshop]] (CHAW), the [[Embassy of Canada, Washington, D.C.|Canadian Embassy]], [http://esartes.org/ EsArtes] of Suchitoto, El Salvador, and a Youth Village in Israel.

==Evaluations and Assessments==
Written literacy evaluations and self-assessments are conducted during initial and final workshop visits at program sites, and assessment results are judged via a specific rubric developed by YPT's outside evaluator, faculty and staff, aimed at showing the changes in students' literacy, their abilities with language and addressing [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] and [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act|national]] English [[Language Arts]] Standards, as well as measurable changes in attitude/engagement in their own education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/What+Students+Are+Learning/Learning+Standards+for+Grades+Pre-K-8 |title=Learning Standards for Grades Pre-K-8   |publisher=DCPS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/What+Students+Are+Learning/Learning+Standards+for+High+School+Subjects |title=Learning Standards for High School Subjects   |publisher=DCPS }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] have called on YPT to share their successful evaluations and assessments to advance the field of arts education on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.ed.gov/grants/investing-in-innovation/applicant/15084 |title=Young Playwrights' Theater - In-School Playwriting Program Development Project   |publisher=United States Department of Education }}&lt;/ref&gt;
