The '''1998 killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan''' refers to the siege of the Iranian consulate in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], in the [[Taliban]]-[[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|controlled]] [[Afghanistan]] during the Taliban and [[Northern Alliance]] [[battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–98)|battles of Mazar-i-Sharif]]. Initially the death of 8 Iranian diplomats was reported, but later two other diplomats and a journalist were also confirmed dead, bringing the total deaths to 11.&lt;ref name="Tehran Times"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Film on 1998 Iranian diplomats’ murder in Mazar-i-Sharif premieres in Tehran|journal=Tehran Times|date=August 25, 2015|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/248916/Film-on-1998-Iranian-diplomats-murder-in-Mazar-i-Sharif-premieres|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killings of the diplomats is speculated to have been carried out by [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;{{cite book|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|title=The Search for Al Qaeda: Its Leadership, Ideology, and Future|year=2010|publisher=Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0451-5|pages=66–67|edition=2nd Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=Roy|title=How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|year=2008|publisher=Institute of Peace Press|isbn=978-1-60127-024-5|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Further|Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–98)}}
Before this incident, Iran was supportive of the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]], and the city of Mazari Sharif was one of the headquarters of the alliance. It is reported that between May and July 1997 [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]] executed thousands of Taliban prisoners as a revenge for the 1995 death of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]]. "He is widely believed to have been responsible for the brutal massacre of up to 3,000 Taliban prisoners after inviting them into Mazar-i-Sharif."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1615824.stm#pahlawan |title=Afghan powerbrokers: Who's who |publisher=BBC News |date= November 19, 2001|accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a revenge, Taliban forces captured Mazar-i-Sharif and killed hundreds of Northern Alliance members, particularly members of the Hazara and Uzbek ethnic group as they were accused of being the ones who carried out the killings of Taliban prisoners.

==Events==
On August 8, 1998, Taliban forces captured Mazar-i-Sharif. After this incident, 11 Iranian diplomats and a correspondent from Iran's state news agency ([[IRNA]]) were attacked at the Iranian consulate and subsequently disappeared. Unofficial reports from the city indicated that all these men were killed. Later it was confirmed that 8 of the Iranian diplomats and the IRNA correspondent were killed by the Taliban militia attacking the consulate. The Taliban spokesmen said the Iranians had been killed by renegade forces who had acted without orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Aftermath==
This incident caused a public furor in Iran and many observers were worried Iran would be involved in a military response to the attack. At the time, more than 70,000 Iranian troops were deployed along the Afghan border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10404">The '''[[1999 IIHF Women's World Championship]]''' qualification process was contested between 10 teams competing for the three final places in the championships. The other seven teams would join Japan (the 6th Place team from the 1998 Olympic games), in the newly formed Pool B.

==Teams==

The following is the nations that competed, and the stage at which they entered the qualification process:

At Pre-Qualification (nations ranked 9th through 12th at the [[1996 IIHF European Women Championships|last European Championship]]) 
*{{ihw|CZE}}
*{{ihw|FRA}}
*{{ihw|NED}}
*{{ihw|SVK}}
At Final Qualification (nations ranked above 9th who did compete in the [[Ice Hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano Olympics]])
*{{ihw|DEN}}
*{{ihw|GER}}
*{{ihw|LAT}}
*{{ihw|NOR}}
*{{ihw|RUS}}
*{{ihw|SUI}}

==Format==

The four teams in the Pre-Qualification group would play a single round robin, with the top two proceeding to the Final Qualification.

The eight teams in Final Qualification would be split into two groups of four, with the top two teams automatically qualifying for the World Championship, and a single match playoff at a neutral location to decide the final qualifier.

The '''2015 Bojangles' Southern 500''', the 66th running of the [[Bojangles' Southern 500|event]], was a [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] race held on September 6, 2015, at [[Darlington Raceway]] in [[Darlington, South Carolina]]. Contested over 367 laps on the 1.366 mile (2.198&amp;nbsp;km) egg-shaped speedway, it was the 25th race of the [[2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] season. [[Carl Edwards]] won the race, the 25th of his career. [[Brad Keselowski]] finished second. [[Denny Hamlin]], [[Joey Logano]] and [[Kevin Harvick]] rounded out the top five.

Keselowski won the pole for the race. He led a race high of 196 laps on his way to a runner–up finish. The race had 24 lead changes among 11 different drivers, as well as 18 caution flag periods for 89 laps.

This was the 25th career victory for Carl Edwards, second of the season, first at Darlington Raceway and fifth at the track for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]]. The win moved Edwards up to 12th in the drivers points standings 235 behind Kevin Harvick. Despite being the winning manufacturer, [[Toyota]] left Darlington trailing [[Chevrolet]] by 63–points in the manufacturer standings.

The Bojangles' Southern 500 was carried by [[NASCAR on NBC|NBC Sports]] on the broadcast [[NBC]] network for the American television audience. The radio broadcast for the race was carried by the [[Motor Racing Network]] and [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM]] [[Sirius XM NASCAR Radio|NASCAR Radio]].

===Background===
[[File:Darlington raceway.svg|thumb|left|Layout of [[Darlington Raceway]], the track where the race was held]]
'''Darlington Raceway''', nicknamed by many NASCAR fans and drivers as "The Lady in Black" or "The Track Too Tough to Tame" and advertised as a "NASCAR tradition", is a [[race track]] built for [[NASCAR]] racing located near [[Darlington, South Carolina]]. It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that will be effective at both ends.

[[Kevin Harvick]] entered Darlington with a 43–point lead over [[Joey Logano]]. [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] entered 89 back. [[Brad Keselowski]] entered 115 back. [[Jimmie Johnson]] entered 116 back.

====Return to Labor Day====
{{quote box|quote="[[Auto Club Speedway]] and [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] did their best to maintain the tradition of Sprint Cup Series racing on the final holiday weekend of the summer, but both came up short. Thankfully, the sanctioning body shuffled a handful of races on this year's schedule to put the [[Bojangles' Southern 500]] back where it began in 1950."source=[[Motor Racing Network]] lead writer and co-host of ''The Morning Drive'' on [[Sirius XM NASCAR Radio]] Pete Pistone giving his thoughts on the return of the Bojangles' Southern 500 to Labor Day weekend&lt;ref name="Opinion: Back Where It Belongs" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2015/09/Opinion-Bojangles-Southern-500-Back-Where-It-Belongs.aspx|title=Opinion: Back Where It Belongs|last=Pistone|first=Pete|publisher=Motor Racing Network|date=September 2, 2015|website=MRN.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=40%|align=right}}
From 1950 to 2003, the Bojangles' Southern 500 was run on [[Labor Day]] weekend in late-August or early-September. For the 2004 season, the race (then known as the '''Mountain Dew Southern 500''') was moved to the penultimate race of the season while a second race at [[Auto Club Speedway]] was added into the Labor Day spot. This lasted for five seasons before it moved to October. [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] moved to the Labor Day spot and remained there from 2009 to 2014. During that time, the Southern 500 moved up to [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]] weekend in May 2005 and remained there for eight years. It then moved to mid-April for 2014. In August of that year, NASCAR announced that the Southern 500 would return to Labor Day weekend for the first time in 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Darlington regains Labor Day event|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/story/_/id/11414383/darlington-raceway-gets-labor-day-weekend-back-next-year|accessdate=September 5, 2015|work=ESPN News Services|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the NASCAR media gave their thoughts on the return to Labor Day weekend. Pete Pistone of the [[Motor Racing Network]] said that Labor Day weekend in Auto Club "never felt right," Labor Day weekend in Atlanta "was better but still not quite there," that Darlington Raceway "fits like a glove" and is "back to where you belong, Bojangles' Southern 500. Don't ever go away again."&lt;ref name="Opinion: Back Where It Belongs" /&gt;

In ESPN.com's weekly Turn 4 series, NASCAR analysts and writers [[Ricky Craven]], Ryan McGhee, John Oreovicz, and Bob Pockrass answered the week's question "Why did it take so long for NASCAR to move the Labor Day race back to Darlington[.]"&lt;ref name="As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/story/_/page/turn420150903/nascar-burning-questions|title=As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger|last1=Craven|last2=McGhee|last3=Oreovicz|last4=Pockrass|first1=Ricky|first2=Ryan|first3=John|first4=Bob|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=September 3, 2015|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craven said that he "wasn't sure" but "[f]ew things are more powerful in sports than the power of tradition. This race is synonymous with Labor Day weekend. Moving it to a spring race felt like inviting Santa Claus to Halloween."&lt;ref name="As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger" /&gt; McGhee said that going back meant "admitting a mistake. NASCAR doesn't like that. Otherwise, we would have gone back to the 2014 aero package six months ago."&lt;ref name="As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger" /&gt; Oreovicz said it most likely was because NASCAR "doesn't do anything until [they decide] it's a good idea, no matter how popular the idea might be to the masses. But this is another sign that NASCAR is actually listening to its constituents a bit more these days."&lt;ref name="As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger" /&gt; Pockrass said that "[s]tubbornness and refusal to admit failure" was his guess and that it was "one of NASCAR's most head-scratching moves in trying to build the sport. NASCAR should have never messed with this tradition in the first place. NASCAR didn't belong in California on Labor Day weekend. It didn't belong in Atlanta. It belongs in Darlington, South Carolina. And it's back. Finally."&lt;ref name="As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger" /&gt;

Jordan Bianchi of ''[[SB Nation]]'' said that there are traditions that are "just too important. They are the institutions that shouldn't be tampered with under almost any circumstance, worthy of being shared from one generation to the next."&lt;ref name="A tradition restored: NASCAR returns to Darlington on Labor Day weekend" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2014/8/27/6073033/nascar-2015-schedule-darlington-raceway-southern-500-labor-day|title=A tradition restored: NASCAR returns to Darlington on Labor Day weekend|last=Bianchi|first=Jordan|publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]]|date=September 2, 2015|website=sbnation.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also added that by returning "Darlington to Labor Day weekend, NASCAR has righted a wrong; even if it was a tradition that should have never been abandoned in the first place."&lt;ref name="A tradition restored: NASCAR returns to Darlington on Labor Day weekend" /&gt;

Mike Hembree of ''[[USA Today]]'' called the initial decision of moving the race from Labor Day weekend "[s]ports blasphemy of the highest order" and its return to Labor Day weekend as being "back where, as people in this farming section of South Carolina will tell you, God meant it to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hembree|first=Mike|title=NASCAR restores beloved tradition with Darlington's move back to Labor Day|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/09/02/darlington-southern-500-labor-day-weekend-tradition-history/71600684/|accessdate=September 2, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.|date=September 4, 2015|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Change to the track====
Since its most recent Sprint Cup Series race in [[2014 Bojangles' Southern 500|April 2014]], Darlington Raceway added {{Convert|4,600|ft|m|abbr=on}} of additional [[SAFER barrier]] to both the front and backstretch walls.&lt;ref name="Darlington Raceway adds SAFER barrier on straightaways" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://nascartalk.nbcsports.com/2015/09/04/darlington-raceway-adds-safer-barrier-on-straightaways/|title=Darlington Raceway adds SAFER barrier on straightaways|last=Long|first=Dustin|publisher=NBC Sports|date=September 4, 2015|website=nascartalk.nbcsports.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Darlington the second track on the Sprint Cup schedule, after Bristol, to line the entire circumference of the outside retaining wall with the energy-absorbing barrier.&lt;ref name="Darlington Raceway adds SAFER barrier on straightaways" /&gt;

For this race, NASCAR redesigned the restart zone so that it would be more visible and eliminate driver complaints about "jumped restarts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/nascar-redesigns-its-restart-zone|title=NASCAR redesigns its restart zone|last=Utter|first=Jim|publisher=Motorsport.com, Inc.|date=September 4, 2015|website=Motorsport.com|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aero package====
For this race, teams used the low-downforce aero package that was used at [[2015 Quaker State 400|Kentucky Speedway]].&lt;ref name="New rules coming at several tracks this season" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/7/7/rules-package-sprint-cup-darlington-low-downforce-kentucky-indianapolis-michigan.html|title=New rules coming at several tracks this season|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|publisher=NASCAR Media Group, LLC.|date=July 7, 2015|website=NASCAR.com|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This package included a {{Convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} spoiler (reduced from {{Convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}}), a {{Convert|25|in|cm|abbr=on}} radiator pan (reduced from {{Convert|38|in|cm|abbr=on}}) and a quarter inch (.64&amp;nbsp;cm) leading edge splitter.&lt;ref name="New rules coming at several tracks this season" /&gt;

====New tire compound====
For this weekend's race, [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] brought a softer tire compound to go with the low-downforce package.&lt;ref name="NASCAR's low-downforce aero package gets tires to match at Darlington" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/nascar-s-low-downforce-aero-package-gets-tires-to-match-at-darlington/|title=NASCAR's low-downforce aero package gets tires to match at Darlington|last=Utter|first=Jim|publisher=Motorsport.com, Inc.|date=September 1, 2015|website=Motorsport.com|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes included different construction and mold shapes for the left-side tires and the right-side tires would provide more grip.&lt;ref name="NASCAR's low-downforce aero package gets tires to match at Darlington" /&gt;

====Throwback paint schemes====
In celebration of the event, 32 of the 46 teams entered for this weekend's race unveiled throwback and special paint schemes as part of the return of the Bojangles' Southern 500 to Labor Day weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iacobelli|first=Pete|title=Darlington's iconic Southern 500 to feature throwback paint schemes|url=http://www.timesnews.net/article/9091434/darlingtons-iconic-southern-500-to-feature-throwback-paint-schemes|accessdate=September 4, 2015|work=[[Kingsport Times-News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=Kingsport Publishing Corporation|date=August 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chip Wile, track president of Darlington Raceway and brainchild of the throwback idea, had initially thought maybe eight or 10 teams could be persuaded to take part in this and get more teams to do it next season.&lt;ref name="Gluck: Throwback paint schemes just what Darlington needed" &gt;{{cite news|last=Gluck|first=Jeff|title=Gluck: Throwback paint schemes just what Darlington needed|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/09/03/darlington-southern-500-retro-paint-schemes-throwback-weekend/71670972/|accessdate=September 5, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.|date=September 3, 2015|location=[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told Jeff Gluck of ''USA Today'' that he thought "this is bigger than what people imagined what it would be in [y]ear [one]" and that he thought "the sport needed this. NASCAR has such a rich history, and we need to celebrate that."&lt;ref name="Gluck: Throwback paint schemes just what Darlington needed" /&gt;

====Entry list====
The entry list for the 66th annual Bojangles' Southern 500 was released on Sunday, August 28 at 3:12&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern time. Forty-six drivers were entered for the race. All but the No. 25 [[Hendrick Motorsports]] Chevrolet were entered for the previous race at [[2015 Irwin Tools Night Race|Bristol]]. [[Jeb Burton]] and [[J. J. Yeley]] swapped rides at [[BK Racing]] with Burton driving the No. 23 Toyota and Yeley driving the No. 26 Toyota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/yeley-and-burton-swap-rides|title=Yeley and Burton swap rides|last=Spencer|first=Lee|publisher=Motorsport.com, Inc.|date=August 25, 2015|website=Motorsport.com|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Travis Kvapil]] drove the No. 30 Chevrolet for [[The Motorsports Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettextra.com/20150903/fuel_tires_travis_kvapil_keeps_on_truckin|title=Fuel &amp; Tires: Travis Kvapil keeps on truckin'|last=Falkenstein|first=Dave|publisher=GazetteXtra|date=September 3, 2015|website=gazettextra.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timmy Hill]] drove the No. 62 Chevrolet for [[Premium Motorsports]].

[[File:Brad Keselowski at the Daytona 500.JPG|thumb|right|[[Brad Keselowski]], seen here at the [[2015 Daytona 500]], won the pole for the race.]]
[[Brad Keselowski]] won the pole with a time of 27.492 and a speed of {{Convert|178.874|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Keselowski Wins Darlington Pole" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2015/09/Keselowski-Wins-Darlington-Pole.aspx|title=Keselowski Wins Darlington Pole|last=Mays|first=Robbie|publisher=Motor Racing Network|date=September 5, 2015|website=MRN.com|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I’ve always thought of Darlington as being one of the unique tracks in NASCAR. You look at Bristol, Daytona and Charlotte and Darlington is in the top five of our sport and what it means," Keselowski said. It’s a great accomplishment to me personally."&lt;ref name="Keselowski Wins Darlington Pole" /&gt; "It’s quite exciting with the way the format is set up with three runs to go for the pole. Each run out you lose so much grip in the tires, it’s a challenge to try to find the right balance and it turns into fun," [[Kurt Busch]] said. Our first run out the car was almost too fast. The car almost drove too good."&lt;ref name="Keselowski Wins Darlington Pole" /&gt; "We were fairly good in the first two rounds. I felt like I could have pushed harder in those two rounds to go faster; and that last round, we just kind of missed the balance on our Chevrolet," [[Kevin Harvick]] said. I feel a lot better about it in race trim than I did in qualifying trim. We try to concentrate on that the most because there is so much falloff."&lt;ref name="Keselowski Wins Darlington Pole" /&gt;

==Race==

===First half===

====Start====
Under overcast [[South Carolina]] evening skies, [[Brad Keselowski]] led the field to the green flag at 7:24&amp;nbsp;p.m. and led the first lap. He pulled to a one-second lead over [[Kevin Harvick]] after five laps. The first caution of the race flew on lap 7 for a three-car spin on the backstretch.&lt;ref name="Chase Elliott goes around early in Bojangles' Southern 500" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/chase-elliott-darlington-raceway-bojangles-southern-500-goes-around-early-090615|title=Chase Elliott goes around early in Bojangles' Southern 500|last=Pennell|first=Jay|publisher=Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.|date=September 6, 2015|website=FoxSports.com|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began when [[Brett Moffitt]] hit the wall while exiting turn 2.&lt;ref name="Chase Elliott goes around early in Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt; In an accordion fashion, [[Cole Whitt]] slammed into the rear of his car and [[Chase Elliott]] slammed into the rear of his car, sending both of them in a spin.&lt;ref name="Chase Elliott goes around early in Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted on lap 14. Unlike [[2014 Bojangles' Southern 500|last year's race]], the bottom line appeared to be the preferred restart lane. Unlike the initial start, Keselowski didn't simply pull away as [[Kurt Busch]] reeled him in. Suddenly, [[Matt Kenseth]], running third, got real sideways and slapped the wall exiting turn 2. This gave him an unscheduled stop three laps later. Eventually, Keselowski began to pull away from Busch. The second caution flew on lap 44 when [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] got loose in turn 3, saved it, got loose again, and spun out in turn 4.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" &gt;{{Cite episode|title=2015 Bojangles' Southern 500|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsLEyLJ1vSU|accessdate=September 14, 2015|series=Sprint Cup Series|series-link=Sprint Cup Series|network=NBC Sports|station=NBC|location=Darlington, South Carolina|date=August 22, 2015|season=67|time=7:47 p.m.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race restarted on lap 51. Debris on the frontstretch brought out the third caution on lap 61. [[Kasey Kahne]] opted to make just a two-tire pit stop and exited with the lead. [[Carl Edwards]] opted not to pit and assumed that position, putting Kahne in second.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted on lap 66. That same lap, Edwards was passed by Kahne for the lead. Three laps later, [[Denny Hamlin]], on four new tires, passed Kahne for the lead. The fourth caution flew on lap 108 when [[Michael Annett]] got loose in turn 2 and spun down the backstretch.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

====Second quarter====
The race restarted on lap 115. Keselowski drove around the outside of Hamlin in turn 2 to take the lead on lap 119. The fifth caution flew on lap 122 when [[Mike Bliss]] cut down his right-front tire on the backstretch and slammed the wall in turn 3. [[Kyle Busch]] opted not to pit and assumed the lead.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted on lap 125. The sixth caution flew on that same lap when [[J. J. Yeley]] apparently made contact with Annett in turn 3 and destroyed the protective foam on the driver's side of his car.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted on lap 133. The seventh caution of the race flew on lap 134 when [[Jimmie Johnson]] drifted down into the path of [[Joey Logano]] and spun out exiting turn 4.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted on lap 139. Harvick used the outside to take the lead the next lap, but gave it back to Keselowski on the next lap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nascar.nbcsports.com/2015/09/06/brad-keselowski-leads-the-southern-500-at-halfway-point/|title=Brad Keselowski leads the Southern 500 at halfway point|last=McFadin|first=Daniel|publisher=NBC Sports|date=September 6, 2015|website=nascartalk.nbcsports.com|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eighth caution of the race flew on lap 165 when [[Trevor Bayne]] made heavy contact with [[Danica Patrick]]. Trying to get down on pit road, his tires blew and he spun out.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

"I felt like I was in a pretty decent rhythm. It snapped pretty hard in (Turn) 4. So, I don’t know, I mean they said it looked like it snapped pretty hard. It felt like that it was definitely more sudden and something that I wasn’t expecting. It is definitely possible that it just got loose. For a few laps before that I felt like I could pull the yaw pretty easily through (Turns) 3 and 4. The one thing about Darlington is you definitely run a lot of lines here. I was running – I felt better lower than higher, so at times I was a lane or two below the dotted line. Debris is just something that happens here because we are using so much track, but I’m not 100 percent sure could have just got loose. But, it could have been a cut tire too, just not sure.

===Second half===

====Halfway====
The race restarted on lap 195. The 10th caution of the race flew on lap 198 when [[Ricky Stenhouse, Jr.]] got loose, slid down the track, and slammed the inside wall in turn 4. There, [[T. J. Bell]] and [[Alex Bowman]] made contact and both slammed the wall.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted on lap 203. Kurt Busch drove past Keselowski exiting turn 2 to take the lead. The 11th caution of the race flew on lap 208 when Kyle Busch apparently made contact with [[Greg Biffle]] sending both spinning. [[Kyle Larson]] opted not to pit and assumed the lead.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted on lap 212. Larson was passed by Stewart for the lead. Later, Hamlin drove under Stewart to retake that position on lap 223. The 12th caution of the race flew on lap 229 when Elliott blew his right-front tire out and hit the outside wall. Hamlin swapped the lead with Harvick on pit road as the former pitted before the start/finish line, and the latter left pit road with the lead.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted on lap 238. The 13th caution of the race flew on lap 246 when [[Trevor Bayne]] cut down his right-rear tire and spun in turn 4. Logano opted not to pit and assumed the lead.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted on lap 252. The 14th caution of the race flew on lap 265 when [[David Ragan]] got loose, slid down the track, and hit the inside wall on the frontstretch. Kyle Busch opted not to pit and assumed the lead.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted on lap 270. Busch botched the restart and Joey Logano retook the lead. The 15th caution of the race flew on lap 279 when Ragan got hooked into the outside wall by [[Paul Menard]], turned down the track, and slammed the inside wall.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

====Fourth quarter====
[[File:Carl Edwards at the Daytona 500.JPG|thumb|right|[[Carl Edwards]], seen here at the [[2015 Daytona 500]], scored his 25th career victory in the Bojangles' Southern 500.]]
The race restarted on lap 283. Debris in turn 1 brought out the 16th caution of the race on lap 300.  Keselowski beat Harvick off pit road to retake the lead.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted on lap 306. The 17th caution of the race flew with 60 laps to go when Martin Truex, Jr. tapped the rear of Kurt Busch and sent him spinning.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted with 55 laps to go. With 50 to go, Harvick began putting pressure on race leader Keselowski. He had the momentum to pull off the pass exiting turn 2 with 45 to go, but he bobbled on the exit and Keselowski remained in the lead. Edwards pulled to Harvick and began pressuring him for second. Edwards edged Keselowski at the line with 22 laps to go and Brad took back the lead the next lap. The 18th caution of the race, a new track record, came out with 13 laps to go when [[Jeb Burton]] made contact with Johnson and spun out. This was a new world record for the most cautions in the Southern 500. Edwards beat Keselowski off pit road to retake the lead.&lt;ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" /&gt;

The race restarted with eight laps to go. Edwards drove off to score his 25th career victory at Darlington Raceway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gluck|first=Jeff|title=Carl Edwards wins Southern 500 at Darlington|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/09/07/carl-edwards-wins-southern-500-darlington/71830224/|accessdate=September 7, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.|date=September 7, 2015|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media comments====
{{quote box|quote="The second race with a lower downforce aerodynamic package didn’t seem to have the overall dramatic results like what was seen at Kentucky in July. Certainly a huge part of the reason is the unique layout of Darlington, which is nowhere near as wide as Kentucky or has a racing surface as worn out. But there were some interesting battles for position during the 500-mile grind, particularly in the closing laps. However, the drivers were very optimistic heading into the race and gave it glowing reviews after the race. Overall it appears this is the direction NASCAR will head in creating 2016 rules packages. Goodyear’s tire seemed to perfectly fit the package and drivers needed to manage their rubber all race long to combat fall off. The sanctioning body will sift through the data acquired from Sunday’s race and solicit input from the garage area before making any final decisions.’’|source=[[Motor Racing Network]] lead writer and co-host of ''The Morning Drive'' on [[Sirius XM NASCAR Radio]] Pete Pistone giving his thoughts on the Bojangles' Southern 500.&lt;ref name="Darlington Rear-View Mirror" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2015/09/Darlington-Rear-View-Mirror.aspx|title=Darlington Rear-View Mirror|last=Pistone|first=Pete|publisher=Motor Racing Network|date=September 7, 2015|website=MRN.com|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=40%|align=right}}

Members of the NASCAR media gave their opinions of the second race with the low-downforce aero package. Pete Pistone, lead writer for the [[Motor Racing Network]] and co-host of ''The Morning Drive'' on [[Sirius XM NASCAR Radio]], said that this race "didn’t seem to have the overall dramatic results like what was seen at Kentucky in July," but that "there were some interesting battles for position during the 500-mile grind, particularly in the closing laps" and that "the drivers were very optimistic heading into the race and gave it glowing reviews after the race."&lt;ref name="Darlington Rear-View Mirror" /&gt;

Jeff Gluck of ''[[USA Today]]'' said that while "the Southern 500 was a grueling marathon and a caution fest that lasted more than four and a half hours..., it also was a very entertaining race that featured tight battles for the lead and the kind of tire falloff that helped NASCAR rise to popularity in the first place."&lt;ref name="Gluck: NASCAR should take 2016 direction from Darlington" &gt;{{cite news|last=Gluck|first=Jeff|title=Gluck: NASCAR should take 2016 direction from Darlington|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/09/07/darlington-southern-500-carl-edwards-low-downforce-rules-package-hit-2016/71832922/|accessdate=September 7, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.|date=September 7, 2015|location=[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that it was "exactly what the sport needed – confirmation the package is indeed the right direction to go after Kentucky already was a major success."&lt;ref name="Gluck: NASCAR should take 2016 direction from Darlington" /&gt;

Jim Utter of [[Motorsport.com]], factoring in the opinions of drivers and NASCAR on the package, said that if there was "such a thing as a consensus in NASCAR, the low-downforce aerodynamics package debuted at Kentucky earlier this season may be as close as the sport gets to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/nascar-and-drivers-praise-darlington-aero-package|title=NASCAR and drivers praise Darlington aero package|last=Utter|first=Jim|publisher=Motorsport.com, Inc.|date=September 7, 2015|website=Motorsport.com|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Oreovicz of [[ESPN.com]] said "the star of the show was NASCAR's low drag aero package" and that "[i]f the high-drag package run at Indianapolis and Michigan can almost unquestionably be called a failure, the low-drag package has proven to provide almost everything the drivers have asked for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/story/_/page/MondayRundown20150907/nascar-low-drag-package-was-no-drag-darlington|title=Monday Rundown: Sprint Cup's low-drag package entertaining|last=Oreovicz|first=John|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=September 7, 2015|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Larry McReynolds]] of [[Fox Sports]] said he doesn't "know how in the world anybody can complain about what we saw at Darlington on Sunday night" and that while he understands "the race was long...the racing was good. I know there will be some debate about a four-and-a-half-hour race. I am normally the one that's beating the drum that we don't need to be doing that as our society has outgrown that. This was a very special event, and I don't think it needs to change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McReynolds|first=Larry|authorlink=Larry McReynolds|title=A tip of the hat: Larry Mac likes what he saw at the 'Lady in Black'|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/darlington-raceway-southern-500-race-recap-larry-mcreynolds-carl-edwards-090815|website=FoxSports.com|publisher=Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.|accessdate=September 9, 2015|date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darrell Waltrip]] of Fox Sports said he thought "Sunday was a great example of why there is so much passion within our sport about Darlington" and that he thought "the aero package seems to be the way to go. It worked at Kentucky and it seemed to work Sunday night. These cars have a lot of downforce built into the body anyway, so we don't need that big huge spoiler on the back of the car."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waltrip|first=Darrell|authorlink=Darrell Waltrip|title=Embracing your past: DW breaks down the throwback weekend at Darlington|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/embracing-your-past-dw-breaks-down-the-throwback-weekend-at-darlington-090815|website=FoxSports.com|publisher=Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.|accessdate=September 9, 2015|date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nate Ryan of [[NBC Sports]] said that it would "be better if NASCAR bravely calls an audible for the Chase and institutes the low-downforce package that met with smashingly positive reviews at Kentucky Speedway and Darlington Raceway. The mantra from NASCAR over the past six years has been that fan satisfaction should supersede everything in determining its direction. Whether installing double-file restarts or making three attempts at a green-white-checkered finish, there often has been little fair to competitors about the recent initiatives aimed at increasing the entertainment value. The same concept holds true for low downforce."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nascar.nbcsports.com/2015/09/09/ryan-low-downforce-should-be-high-priority-in-chase/|title=Ryan: Low downforce should be high priority in NASCAR Chase|last=Ryan|first=Nate|publisher=NBC Sports|date=September 9, 2015|website=nascartalk.nbcsports.com|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''473 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Mamercus and Iullus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 281 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 473 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

{{Nihongo|'''''Barefoot Gen'''''|はだしのゲン|Hadashi no Gen}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] series by [[Keiji Nakazawa]].  Loosely based on Nakazawa's own experiences as a Hiroshima survivor, the series begins in 1945 in and around [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]], where the six-year-old boy Gen Nakaoka lives with his family. After Hiroshima is destroyed by [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]], Gen and other survivors are left to deal with the aftermath. It ran in several magazines, including ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', from 1973 to 1985. It was subsequently adapted into three [[live action]] film adaptations directed by Tengo Yamada, which were released between 1976 and 1980. [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] released two [[anime]] films, [[Barefoot Gen (1983 film)|one in 1983]] and [[Barefoot Gen 2|one in 1986]]. In 2007, a [[live action]] [[Japanese television drama|television drama]] series adaptation aired in Japan on [[Fuji TV]] over two nights, August 10 and 11.

==Publication history==
Cartoonist [[Keiji Nakazawa]] created the feature ''Ore wa Mita'' (translated into English as ''[[I Saw It]]''), an eyewitness account of the atomic-bomb devastation in Japan, in the monthly manga ''[[Monthly Shōnen Jump]]'' in 1972. In the United States it was published through Educomics in 1982.&lt;ref name=toonopedia-gen&gt;[http://toonopedia.com/gen.htm ''Barefoot Gen'' a.k.a. ''Gen of Hiroshima''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6jUkU7atp?url=http://toonopedia.com/gen.htm Archived] from the original on August 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Nakazawa went on to serialize the longer, autobiographical ''Hadashi No Gen'' (''Barefoot Gen'')&lt;ref name=toonopedia-gen /&gt; beginning in the June 4, 1973 edition of ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' manga magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediaarts-db.jp/mg/magazine_works/1872 |title=はだしのゲン |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was cancelled after a year and a half, and moved to three other less widely distributed magazines: ''Shimin'' (Citizen), ''Bunka Hyōron'' (Cultural Criticism), and ''Kyōiku Hyōron'' (Educational Criticism).{{cite needed|date=July 2016}} It was published in book collections in Japan beginning in 1975.

==Plot==
The story begins in Hiroshima during the final months of [[World War II]]. Six-year-old Gen Nakaoka and his family live in poverty and struggle to make ends meet. Gen's father Daikichi urges them to "live like wheat," which always grows strong despite being trod on. Daikichi is critical of the war. When he shows up drunk to a mandatory combat drill and backtalks to his instructor, the Nakaokas are branded as traitors and subject to harassment and discrimination by their neighbors. To restore his family's honour, Gen's older brother Koji joins the Navy against Daikichi's wishes, where he is subjected to a brutal training regimen by his commanding officer. On August 6, the atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. Gen's father and siblings perish in the fires, but he and his mother escape. The shock causes her to give premature birth; Gen's new sister is named Tomoko.

In the days following the attack, Gen and his mother witness the horrors wrought by the bomb. Hiroshima lies in ruins, and the city is full of people dead and dying from severe burns and radiation sickness. Gen meets a girl named Natsue, whose face has been severely burned. She attempts to commit suicide, but Gen convinces her to continue living. Gen and his mother adopt an orphan named Ryuta, who by sheer coincidence looks identical to Gen's deceased younger brother Shinji. After Gen returns to their burnt-out home and retrieves the remains of his father and siblings, he and his family go to live with Kime's friend Kiyo. However, Kiyo's crotchety mother-in-law conspires with her grandchildren to drive the Nakaokas out.

Gen looks for work to pay the family's rent. A man hires him to look after his brother Seiji, who has been burnt from head to toe and lives in squalor. Though Seiji is reluctant at first, he warms up to Gen over time: The boy learns Seiji is an artist who has lost the will to live because his burns have left him unable to hold a brush. With Gen's help, Seiji learns to paint with his teeth but, eventually, he dies of his wounds. On August 14, Emperor [[Hirohito]] announces Japan's surrender over the radio, ending the war.

Following Japan's unconditional surrender, American occupation forces arrive to help the nation rebuild. Gen and Ryuta, fearing rumours they've heard about the Americans, arm themselves with a pistol they find in an abandoned weapons cache. They learn the Americans aren't as bad as they'd thought when they're given free candy, but they also witness a group of American soldiers harvesting organs from corpses for medical research. Kiyo's mother-in-law evicts the Nakaokas after Gen gets into a fight with her grandchildren, and they move into an abandoned bomb shelter. Gen and Ryuta attempt to earn money to feed Tomoko, getting involved with the local Yakuza. After the Yakuza betray them, Ryuta kills one of them with the pistol they found and becomes a fugitive. Later, Gen learns that Tomoko has been kidnapped. He finds her with the help of a classmate, only to learn that she's become ill. Tomoko dies soon after.

In December 1947, Gen is reunited with Ryuta, who has become a juvenile delinquent, doing odd jobs for the Yakuza. He meets Katsuko, a girl scarred by burns from the bomb. As an orphan and a [[hibakusha]], she is subject to discrimination and cannot go to school; Gen lends her his books and teaches her himself.

==Themes==
{{original research|section|date=August 2016}}
Major themes throughout the work are power, [[hegemony]], resistance and loyalty.

Gen's family suffers as all families do in war.  They must conduct themselves as proper members of society, as all Japanese are instructed in paying tribute to the Emperor. But because of a belief that their involvement in the war is due to the greed of the rich ruling class, Gen's father rejects the military propaganda and the family comes to be treated as traitors.  Gen's family struggles with their bond of loyalty to each other and to a government that is willing to send teenagers on suicide missions in battle.  This push and pull relationship is seen many times as Gen is ridiculed in school, mimicking his father's views on Japan's role in the war, and then is subsequently punished by his father for spouting things he learned through rote brainwashing in school.

Many of these themes are put into a much harsher perspective when portrayed alongside themes of the struggle between war and peace.

The group Rondo Gen published an [[Esperanto]] translation as ''Nudpieda Gen'' (''Barefoot Gen'') in 1982.  The chief translator was Izumi Yukio.

The German [[Rowohlt Verlag]] published only the first volume in 1982 under their [[Mass market paperback|mass-market]] label "rororo". [[Carlsen Comics]] tried it again in 2004 but cancelled the publication after four volumes. Both publishers took the name ''Barfuß durch Hiroshima'' (''Barefoot through Hiroshima'').

The first volume was published in Norwegian in 1986 by [http://www.tegneserier.no/default.asp?ID=35&amp;lib=forlag GEVION norsk forlag A/S]. The Norwegian title is ''Gen, Gutten fra Hiroshima'' (''Gen, the Boy from Hiroshima''). A similar edition in Swedish (''Gen – Pojken från Hiroshima'' was published in 1985 by Alvglans förlag, which may have been the earliest published manga in Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daisuki.se/default.asp?del%3Dovrigt%26sida%3Dartiklar%26id%3D42 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813061130/http://www.daisuki.se/default.asp?del=ovrigt&amp;sida=artiklar&amp;id=42 |archivedate=2010-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume was published in Finnish in 1985 by Jalava, becoming the first Japanese comic to be published in Finland, but publishing was likewise abandoned. The Finnish title is ''Hiroshiman poika'' (The Son of Hiroshima), and Finnish translation was done by Kaija-Leena Ogihara. In 2006 Jalava republished the first volume (with its original translation) and continued with publication of second volume.

All 10 volumes were published in Poland by [[Waneko]] in 2004-2011 under the title "Hiroszima 1945: Bosonogi Gen".&lt;ref&gt;http://manga.tanuki.pl/strony/manga/68-hiroszima-1945-bosonogi-gen/rec/204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Society Publishers]] produced a second English-language run of the series in [[graphic novel]] format (as ''Barefoot Gen: The Cartoon Story of Hiroshima'') starting in 1988.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

===New English edition===

A new English translation has been released by [[Last Gasp]] (starting in 2004) with an introduction by [[Art Spiegelman]], who has compared the work to his own work, ''[[Maus]]'' (which is about the experiences of Spiegelman's father during [[the Holocaust]] in [[Europe]]).

==Media==

===Films===

====Live-action====
In 1976, 1977 and 1980, Tengo Yamada directed three live-action version films.

* [[Barefoot Gen (1976 film)|''Barefoot Gen'' (1976)]]
* [[Barefoot Gen: Explosion of Tears|''Barefoot Gen: Explosion of Tears'' (1977)]]
* [[Barefoot Gen Part 3: Battle of Hiroshima|''Barefoot Gen: Part 3 Battle of Hiroshima'' (1980)]]

====Animated films====
Two [[animated film]]s were based on the manga, in 1983 and 1986, both directed by Mori Masaki for a production company that Nakazawa founded.

* [[Barefoot Gen (1983 film)|''Barefoot Gen'' (1983)]]
* [[Barefoot Gen 2|''Barefoot Gen 2'' (1986)]]

''[[Barefoot Gen 2]]'' is set three years after the bomb fell. It focuses on the continuing survival of Gen and orphans in Hiroshima.

Often action, dialogue and the images are almost expressionistic to add to the impact of the film. The falling of the bomb is shown first from the American point of view which is very orderly and impassive. Then, when the bomb explodes, the view is from the Japanese showing powerful images of people being graphically vaporized, buildings exploding and multi-color explosions.

Initially released individually on dub-only VHS tape by [[Streamline Pictures]], and then dub-only DVD by [[Image Entertainment]], [[Geneon]] eventually sold bilingual versions of the film on DVD as a set.

===TV drama===
A two episode TV drama was produced by [[Fuji Television]] in 2007 and was aired over two days.

=== Theatre Productions ===
There have been a number of stage play adaptations of ''Barefoot Gen'' produced in Japan. 

In July 1996 the first stage adaptation in English was premiered at the [[Crucible Theatre]], Sheffield, UK. The production was a collaboration between the Crucible Theatre and [http://www.zenshinza.com Theatre Zenshinza], Tokyo, Japan. In 1994 British theatre director Bryn Jones travelled to Japan to request Mr. Nakazawa's permission to adapt the first volume as a play. Permission was granted and Jones returned to Sheffield to prepare the production; research, design and dramatisation with the Crucible company, Tatsuo Suzuki and Fusako Kurahara. Mr. Nakazawa subsequently travelled to the UK to attend final rehearsals and gave post show talks after the opening performances. The final manuscript was adapted and dramatised by [http://www.zenshinza.com/infomration/profile/enshutsubu_profile_page/suzukitatsuo_new.html Tatsuo Suzuki] and Bryn Jones and translated by Fusako Kurahara. The production received a Japan Festival Award 1997 ''for outstanding achievements in furthering the understanding of Japanese culture in the United Kingdom.''

The Christmas flood of 1964 was "the most severe rainstorm to ever occur over central Oregon, and among the most severe over western Oregon since the late 1870s", according to the [[National Weather Service]] office in Portland.&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt;

Some of the worst mudslides occurred in the [[Mount Hood Corridor]], and one man died in a mud and debris avalanche near [[Rhododendron, Oregon|Rhododendron]] that destroyed 15 houses.&lt;ref name=Dresbeck/&gt; Other deaths occurred from drowning and electrocution, and one man died when the new [[John Day Dam|John Day bridge]] collapsed.&lt;ref name=Lucia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dresbeck/&gt;

[[Yamhill County, Oregon|Yamhill County]] was severely affected.&lt;ref name=Dresbeck/&gt; The [[Oregon Route 219| Highway 219]] bridge between [[Newberg, Oregon|Newberg]] and [[St. Paul, Oregon|St. Paul]], and Wilsonville Road between Newberg and [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]] were closed, trapping hundreds of people.&lt;ref name=Dresbeck/&gt;

On the [[Oregon Coast]], downtown [[Reedsport, Oregon|Reedsport]] was flooded with {{convert|8|ft|m|sigfig=2}} of water, and in [[Coos Bay, Oregon|Coos Bay]], a massive logjam contributed to severe flooding.&lt;ref name=Dresbeck/&gt; The ports at [[Gold Beach, Oregon|Gold Beach]] and [[Brookings, Oregon|Brookings]] were destroyed.&lt;ref name=Dresbeck/&gt;

At [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]], [[Willamette Falls]] was unrecognizable as a waterfall, and the city was flooded by several feet of water.&lt;ref name=Dresbeck/&gt; In [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], the lower deck of the [[Steel Bridge]] was underwater and had also been hit by a [[timber rafting|log raft]] consisting of around 1,000 logs.&lt;ref name=Dresbeck/&gt; The impact of the raft severely damaged the [[Hawthorne Bridge]], closing it for a year.&lt;ref name=Dresbeck/&gt; At {{convert|12|ft|m|sigfig=2}} above flood stage, the flooding of the Willamette River at Portland in 1964 was second only to the 1948 flood that wiped out [[Vanport City, Oregon|Vanport City]].&lt;ref name=Dresbeck/&gt; At its peak, the water was at the top of Downtown Portland's [[seawall]].&lt;ref name=Lucia/&gt;

The [[Southern Pacific]] (SP) rail line between [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[San Francisco]] was out of service for eighteen days as crews repaired damage from landslides near the {{convert|4885|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Cascade Summit, Oregon|Cascade Summit]]; and the parallel [[Willamette Pass]] highway was blocked for several days. [[Salt Creek (Middle Fork Willamette River tributary)|Salt Creek]] washed out {{convert|25|mile|km}} of [[Oregon Route 58]] and undermined the SP viaduct footings.

===California===
[[File:California Disaster Areas, 1964.svg|thumb|right|Map of California showing the 34 counties declared [[disaster area]]s during the flood. The six red counties sustained more damage than the other 28 counties combined.]]
Starting on December 21, intense downpours all across Northern California caused numerous streams to flood, many to record-breaking levels. California Governor Brown declared 34 counties in the region [[disaster area]]s.&lt;ref name=Lucia/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood!"/&gt; Together, [[Del Norte County, California|Del Norte]], [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt]], [[Mendocino County, California|Mendocino]], [[Siskiyou County, California|Siskiyou]], [[Trinity County, California|Trinity]], and [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]] counties sustained more damage than the other 28 counties combined.&lt;ref name="Flood!"/&gt; Twenty-six [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS) [[stream gauge]]s were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Flood!"/&gt;

====North Coast====
The [[Eel River (California)|Eel]], [[Smith River (California)|Smith]], [[Klamath River|Klamath]], [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity]], [[Salmon River (California)|Salmon]], and [[Mad River (California)|Mad]] rivers, as well as other rivers and large streams, all went well beyond flood stage and peaked nearly simultaneously around December 21 and 22, breaking previous records (notably those set in the "hundred year" [[Christmas Week flood of 1955|flood of 1955]] in most cases).&lt;ref name=Lucia/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood!"/&gt; Sixteen [[State highways in California|state highway]] bridges were destroyed in [[California's 1st congressional district]], most of them on [[U.S. Route 101|Highway 101]], and another ten county bridges were destroyed in Humboldt County.&lt;ref name="Flood!"/&gt; The flood destroyed {{convert|37|mile|km}} of track with multiple stream and river crossings of the [[Northwestern Pacific Railroad]] through the Eel River canyon, the region's only major railroad.&lt;ref name=wrr&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nervo |first=Edward H. |year=1965 |title=The Northwestern Pacific |journal=The Western Railroader |volume=28 |issue=301 |page=11 |publisher=Francis A. Guido }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many communities of Del Norte and Humboldt counties suffered massive power outages and were left isolated (or completely cut off from the rest of the state for a period), including the region's larger populated areas around [[Humboldt Bay]], such as [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] and [[Arcata, California|Arcata]], despite the fact that those cities were located on higher ground and not in the path of raging rivers. Unfortunate riverside communities like [[Klamath, California|Klamath]], [[Orleans, California|Orleans]], [[Myers Flat, California|Myers Flat]], [[Weott, California|Weott]], [[South Fork, Humboldt County, California|South Fork]], [[Shively, California|Shively]], [[Pepperwood, California|Pepperwood]], [[Stafford, Humboldt County, California|Stafford]], and [[Ti-Bar, California|Ti-Bar]] were completely destroyed by flood waters; some of them were never rebuilt and none regained their former status. [[Metropolitan, California|Metropolitan]], [[Rio Dell, California|Rio Dell]], and [[Scotia, California|Scotia]] were significantly damaged.&lt;ref name="Flood!"/&gt; The [[Pacific Lumber Company]] [[sawmill]] at Scotia lost 40 [[board foot|MMFBM]] of logs and lumber washed downstream.&lt;ref name=wrr/&gt; [[Crescent City, California|Crescent City]], still recovering from the [[tsunami]] created by the [[1964 Alaska earthquake]] only nine months earlier, also suffered from the floods.&lt;ref name="Flood!"/&gt;

Over {{convert|550|mm|in|disp=flip|sigfig=2}} of rain fell on the Eel River basin in a span of two days. By December 23, {{convert|752000|ft3/s|m3/s|sigfig=3}} of water rushed down the Eel River at Scotia (still upstream from the confluence of the [[Van Duzen River]]),&lt;ref name="Peak"&gt;

{{Gospel Jesus}}
The '''cleansing of the Temple''' narrative tells of [[Jesus]] expelling the merchants and the [[money changer]]s from the [[Herod's Temple|Temple]], and occurs in all four [[canonical gospels]] of the [[New Testament]].

In this [[List of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels|account]], Jesus and his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] travel to [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] for [[Passover]], where Jesus expels the merchants and money changers from the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], accusing them of turning the Temple into "a den of thieves" through their commercial activities.&lt;ref name = "Sanders"&gt;Sanders, E. P. ''The Historical Figure of Jesus.'' Penguin, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "JInt"&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]].

Bromiley 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-3785-9}} page 571–572&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative occurs near the end of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] (at {{bibleref2|Matthew|21:12–17}}, {{bibleref2|Mark|11:15–19}}, and {{bibleref2|Luke|19:45–48}}) and near the start in the Gospel of John (at {{bibleref2|John|2:13–16}}). Some scholars believe that these refer to two separate incidents, given that the Gospel of John also includes more than one Passover.&lt;ref name=Evans &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary'' by [[Craig A.

Jesus is stated to have visited the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], where the courtyard is described as being filled with [[livestock]], merchants, and the tables of the [[money changers]], who changed the standard [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] money for [[Shekel|Jewish]] and [[Tyrian shekel|Tyrian money]].&lt;ref name = "Sanders"/&gt; Jerusalem was packed with Jews who had come for Passover, perhaps numbering 300,000 to 400,000 [[pilgrims]].&lt;ref&gt;[[E.

In {{bibleref2|Mark|12:40}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|20:47}} Jesus accused the Temple authorities of thieving and this time he names poor widows as their victims, going on to provide evidence of this in {{bibleref2|Mark|12:42}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|21:2}}. Dove sellers were selling doves that were sacrificed by the poor who could not afford grander sacrifices and specifically by women. According to {{bibleref2|Mark|11:16}}, Jesus then put an embargo on people carrying any merchandise through the Temple—a sanction that would have disrupted all commerce.&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson &gt;''The Fourth Gospel And the Quest for Jesus'' by Paul N. Anderson 2006 {{ISBN|0-567-04394-0}} page 158&lt;/ref&gt;  This occurred in the outermost court of the [[gentiles]].

{{bibleref2|Matthew|21:14–16}} says the Temple leaders questioned Jesus if he was aware the children were shouting "[[Hosanna]] to the Son of David." Jesus responded by saying "from the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise." This phrase incorporates a phrase from the {{bibleref2|Psalm|8:2}}, "from the lips of children and infants," believed by followers to be an admission of divinity by Jesus, thus confirming his divinity via [[prooftext]]ing the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref name=Evans /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

==Chronology==
{{Main article|Chronology of Jesus}}

There are debates about when the cleansing of the Temple occurred and whether or not there were two separate events. [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] and [[St. Augustine]] agree that Jesus performed a similar act twice, with the less severe denunciations of the Johannine account (merchants, sellers) occurring early in Jesus's public ministry and the more severe denunciations of the synoptic accounts (thieves, robbers) occurring just before, and indeed expediting, the events of the crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;https://dhspriory.org/thomas/John2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims about the Temple cleansing episode in the Gospel of John can be combined with non-biblical historical sources to obtain an estimate of when it occurred.
[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13]] states that Jesus went to the Temple in Jerusalem around the start of his ministry and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] states that Jesus was told: "Forty and six years was this temple in building, and you want to raise it up in three days?"&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L. Maier]] "The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus" in ''Chronos, Kairos, Christos: Nativity and Chronological Studies'' by Jerry Vardaman, Edwin M. Yamauchi 1989 {{ISBN|0-931464-50-1}} pages 113–129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 &gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 Amsterdam University Press {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Antiquities of the Jews]], first-century historian [[Flavius Josephus]] wrote that ([[Antiquities of the Jews|Ant]] 15.380) the temple reconstruction was started by [[Herod the Great]] in the 18th year of his reign 22 BC, two years before [[Augustus]] arrived in Syria in 20 BC to return the son of [[Phraates IV]] and receive in return the spoils and standards of three Roman legions (Ant 15.354).&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} pages 140–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Historical Jesus'' by [[Craig A. Evans]] 2008 {{ISBN|0-415-97569-7}} page 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As stated by Köstenberger &amp; Kellum (page 114) there is some uncertainty about how Josephus referred to and computed dates, hence various scholars arrive at slightly different dates for the exact date of the start of the Temple construction, varying by a few years in their final estimation of the date of the Temple visit.&lt;/ref&gt; Temple expansion and reconstruction was ongoing, and it was in constant reconstruction until it was destroyed in 70 AD by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'', page 246 states that Temple construction never completed, and that the Temple was in constant reconstruction until it was destroyed in 70 AD/CE by the Romans, and states that the 46 years should refers to the actual number of year from the start of the construction.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that it had taken 46 years of construction to that point, the Temple visit in the Gospel of John has been estimated at any time between 24–29 AD. It is possible that the complex was only a few years completed when the future Emperor Titus destroyed the Temple in 70 AD.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PAnderson200 &gt;''The Riddles of the Fourth Gospel: An Introduction to John'' by Paul N.

==Analysis==
[[File:Theodoor Rombouts - Christ Driving the Money-changers from the Temple.jpg|thumb|300px|''Christ Driving the Moneychangers from the Temple'' by [[Theodoor Rombouts]]]]

Professor David Landry of the University of St. Thomas suggests that "the importance of the episode is signaled by the fact that within a week of this incident, Jesus is dead. Matthew, Mark, and Luke agree that this is the event that functioned as the "trigger" for Jesus' death."&lt;ref name=Landry&gt;[https://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol13.no2/Landry_GodDetails.html Landry, David. "God in the Details: The Cleansing of the Temple in Four Jesus Films", ''Journal of Religion and Film'', Vol. 13, No. 2 October 2009, University of Nebraska at Omaha]&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the fact that the actions of Jesus prompted no intervention of the part of either the Temple guards, nor the legionaries in the [[Antonia Fortress|Antonia]], [[Pope Francis]] sees the Cleansing of the Temple not as a violent act but more of a prophetic demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Pope Francis. [https://zenit.org/articles/angelus-address-jesus-cleanses-the-temple-of-jerusalem/ "Angelus Address: Jesus Cleanses the Temple of Jerusalem"]. ''Zenit'', March 4, 2018.

Forrester.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to writing and speaking messages from God, Israelite or Jewish ''nevi'im'' ("spokespersons", "prophets") often acted out prophetic parables in their life.&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, Herbert.

A common interpretation is that Jesus was reacting to the practice of the moneychangers in routinely cheating the people, but Marvin L. Krier Mich observes that a good deal of money was stored at the temple, where it could be loaned by the wealthy to the poor who were in danger of losing their land to debt. The Temple establishment therefore co-operated with the aristocracy in the exploitation of the poor. One of the first act of the Jewish Revolt of 66 was the burning of the debt records in the archives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XU8NAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT142&amp;dq=cleansing+of+the+temple+catholic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8oO-b9LTeAhWMy1MKHbAaDew4ChDoAQhbMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=cleansing%20of%20the%20temple%20catholic&amp;f=false Mich, Marvin L.

===Toledot Yeshu===
As with other parts of Jesus's story, there are a number of later embellishments to the narrative of the incident that are generally regarded as legendary or polemical by scholars. The [[Toledot Yeshu]], a parody gospel probably first written down about 1,000 years later but possibly dependent on second-century Jewish-Christian gospel&lt;ref&gt;Price, Robert (2003) ''The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; if not oral traditions that might go back all the way to the formation of the canonical narratives themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, P. 'Jesus and his Mother in the Jewish Anti-Gospel (the Toledot Yeshu)', in eds. C. Clivaz et al., ''Infancy Gospels'', Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck GmbH &amp; Co. KG, 2011, pp. 588-616.&lt;/ref&gt; claims that [[Yeshu]] had entered the Temple with 310 of his followers. That Christ's followers had indeed entered the Temple, and in fact the [[Holy of Holies]],&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Morris. ''Jesus in the Jewish Tradition''. New York, NY: The Macmillan Company, 1950, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; is also claimed by [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], who claims that James wore the [[breastplate of the high priest]] and the high priestly diadem on his head and actually entered the Holy of Holies,&lt;ref&gt;Bauckham, ''The Testimony of the Beloved Disciple'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and that John the Beloved had become a sacrificing priest who wore the mitre,&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, Robert, ''Maccabees, Zadokites, Christians, and Qumran: A New Hypothesis of Qumran Origins''. Nashville, TN: Grave Distractions Publications, 2013, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; which was the headdress of the high priest.

Yeshu was likewise accused of robbing the ''[[Shemhamphorasch|shem hamphorash]]'', the 'secret name of god' from the Holy of Holies, in the Toledot Yeshu.&lt;ref&gt;Zindler, Frank R. ''The Jesus the Jews Never Knew''. Cranford, NJ: American Atheist Press, 2003, pp. 318–319, 428–431.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative of Joseph of Arimathea===
According to the apocryphal ''Narrative of [[Joseph of Arimathea]]'', [[Demas]], one of the two robbers who were crucified with Christ,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 27:38.&lt;/ref&gt; stole the 'secret deposit' of Solomon from the Holy of Holies, an act which Judas blamed on Christ:
{{quote|He [Demas] made attacks upon the rich, but was good to the poor…And he set his hand to robbing the multitude of the Jews, and stole the law itself in Jerusalem, … And to Caiaphas and the multitude of the Jews it was not a Passover, but it was a great mourning to them, on account of ''the plundering of the sanctuary'' by the robber … Judas says to the Jews: Come, let us hold a council; for perhaps it was not the robber that stole the law, ''but Jesus himself, and I accuse him''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0813.htm Narrative of Joseph of Arimathæa, 1.] in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In art==
The cleansing of the Temple is a commonly depicted event in the [[Life of Christ]], under various titles.

El Greco painted several versions:
*[[Christ Driving the Money Changers from the Temple (El Greco, London)|''Christ Driving the Money Changers from the Temple'' (El Greco, London)]]

{{Soviet Union sidebar}}
&lt;!-- Please see the talk page for the explanation why ''demokratizatsiya'' is not the same as "democratization in the Soviet Union.--&gt;
'''''Demokratizatsiya''''' ({{lang-rus|Демократизация|p=dʲɪməkrətʲɪˈzatsɨjə}}, ''[[democratization]]'') was a slogan introduced by [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in January 1987 calling for the infusion of "[[Democracy|democratic]]" elements into the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[single-party]] [[Government of the Soviet Union|government]].  Gorbachev's Demokratizatsiya meant the introduction of multi-[[candidate]]—though not [[Multi-party system|multiparty]]—elections for local [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] (CPSU) officials and [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]s. In this way, he hoped to rejuvenate the party with progressive personnel who would carry out his institutional and policy reforms. The [[CPSU]] would retain sole custody of the ballot box. &lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{loc}} - [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/rutoc.html Russia],&lt;!-- DO NOT link to section itself; it is NOT a permanent link--&gt; section ''Demokratizatsiya''. Data as of July 1996 (retrieved December 25, 2014)  &lt;/ref&gt;
 
The slogan of ''Demokratizatsiya'' was part of Gorbachev's set of reform programs, including ''[[glasnost]]'' (increasing public discussion of issues and accessibility of information to the public), officially announced in mid-1986, and ''[[uskoreniye]]'', a "speed-up" of economic development. [[Perestroika]] (political and economic restructuring), another slogan that became a full-scale campaign in 1987, embraced them all. 

By the time he introduced the slogan of Demokratizatsiya, Gorbachev had concluded that implementing his reforms outlined at the [[27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Twenty-Seventh Party Congress]] in February 1986 required more than discrediting the "[[wikt:old guard|Old Guard]]". He changed his strategy from trying to work through the CPSU as it existed and instead embraced a degree of political [[liberalization]]. In January 1987, he appealed over the heads of the party to the people and called for democratization.

By the time of the [[28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Twenty-Eighth Party Congress]] in July 1990, it was clear that Gorbachev's reforms came with sweeping, [[unintended consequence]]s, as nationalities of the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republics of the Soviet Union]] pulled harder than ever to [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|break away from the union]] and ultimately dismantle the Communist Party.

==Demokratizatsiya and Gorbachev's reform dilemma==
Gorbachev increasingly found himself caught between criticism by conservatives who wanted to stop reform and liberals who wanted to accelerate it. Meanwhile, despite his intention to maintain a one-party system, the elements of a multiparty system already were crystallising. 

Despite some setbacks, he continued his policy of Demokratizatsiya, and he enjoyed his worldwide perception as the reformer. In June 1988, at the CPSU's Nineteenth Party Conference, the first held since 1941, Gorbachev and his supporters launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus. He again called for multicandidate elections for regional and local legislatures and party first secretaries and insisted on the separation of the government apparatus from party bodies at the regional level as well. In the face of an overwhelming majority of conservatives, Gorbachev still was able to rely on party obedience to the higher authorities to force through acceptance of his reform proposals. Experts called the conference a successful step in promoting party-directed change from above.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

At an unprecedented emergency [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] [[wikt:plenum|plenum]] called by Gorbachev in September 1988, three stalwart old-guard members left the Politburo or lost positions of power. [[Andrei Gromyko]] retired (had decided to retire before the meeting) from the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], [[Yegor Ligachev]] was relieved of the ideology portfolio within the Politburo's Secretariat, and [[Boris Pugo]] replaced Politburo member Mikhail Solomentsev as chairman of the powerful [[CPSU Party Control Committee]]. The Supreme Soviet then elected Gorbachev chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, giving Gorbachev the attributes of power that previously [[Leonid Brezhnev]] had. These changes meant that the Secretariat, until that time solely responsible for the development and implementation of state policies, had lost much of its power.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

Meaningful changes also occurred in governmental structures. In December 1988, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] approved formation of the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union]], which constitutional amendments had established as the Soviet Union's new legislative body. The Supreme Soviet then dissolved itself. The amendments called for a smaller working body of 542 members, also called the Supreme Soviet, to be elected from the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies. To ensure a Communist majority in the new parliament, Gorbachev reserved one-third of the seats for the CPSU and other public organisations.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

The [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|March 1989 election]] of the Congress of People's Deputies marked the first time that voters of the Soviet Union ever chose the membership of a national legislative body. The results of the election stunned the ruling elite. Throughout the country, voters crossed off the ballot unopposed Communist candidates, many of them prominent party officials, taking advantage of the nominal privilege of withholding approval of the listed candidates. However, the Congress of People's Deputies that emerged still contained 87 percent CPSU members. Genuine reformists won only some 300 seats.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

In May the initial session of the Congress of People's Deputies electrified the country. For two weeks on live television, deputies from around the country railed against every scandal and shortcoming of the Soviet system that could be identified. Speakers spared neither Gorbachev, the [[KGB]], nor the military. Nevertheless, a conservative majority maintained control of the congress. Gorbachev was elected without opposition to the chairmanship of the new Supreme Soviet; then the Congress of People's Deputies elected a large majority of old-style party [[apparatchik]]s to fill the membership of its new legislative body. Outspoken opposition leader Yeltsin obtained a seat in the Supreme Soviet only when another deputy relinquished his position. The first Congress of People's Deputies was the last moment of real control for Gorbachev over the political life of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

In the summer of 1989, the first opposition bloc in the Congress of People's Deputies formed under the name of the [[Inter-Regional Group]]. The members of this body included almost all of the liberal and Russian nationalist members of the opposition led by [[Boris Yeltsin]].&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

A primary issue for the opposition was the repeal of Article 6 of the constitution, which prescribed the supremacy of the CPSU over all the institutions in society. Faced with opposition pressure for the repeal of Article 6 and needing allies against hard-liners in the CPSU, Gorbachev obtained the repeal of Article 6 by the February 1990 Central Committee plenum. Later that month, before the Supreme Soviet, he proposed the creation of a new office of [[president of the Soviet Union]], for himself to be elected by the Congress of People's Deputies rather than the popular elections. Accordingly, in March 1990 Gorbachev was elected for the third time in eighteen months to a position equivalent to Soviet head of state. Former first deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet [[Anatoly Lukyanov]] became chairman of the Supreme Soviet.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; The Supreme Soviet became similar to Western parliaments. Its debates were televised daily.

By the time of the Twenty-Eighth Party Congress in July 1990, the CPSU was regarded by liberals and nationalists of the constituent republics as anachronistic and unable to lead the country. The CPSU branches in many of the fifteen Soviet republics began to split into large pro-sovereignty and pro-union factions, further weakening central party control.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

In a series of humiliations, the CPSU had been separated from the government and stripped of its leading role in society and its function in overseeing the national economy. However, the majority of its apparatchiks were successful in obtaining leading positions in the newly formed democratic institutions. For seventy years, CPSU had been the cohesive force that kept the union together; without the authority of the party in the Soviet center, the nationalities of the constituent republics pulled harder than ever to break away from the union.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

'''''Der Kongress tanzt''''' (English: '''''The Congress Dances''''') is a [[Cinema of Germany|German]] [[musical comedy|musical comedy film]] produced in [[1931 in film|1931]] by [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]], directed by [[Erik Charell]], starring [[Lilian Harvey]] as Christel Weinzinger, the glove seller, [[Willy Fritsch]] as [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia]] and his [[doppelgänger]], Uralsky, [[Otto Wallburg]] as Bibikoff, his Adjutant, [[Conrad Veidt]] as Prince Metternich, [[Carl-Heinz Schroth]] as his Secretary, Pepi, [[Lil Dagover]] as the Countess and [[Alfred Abel]] as the King of Saxony.

''Der Kongress tanzt'' is a particularly well achieved move in [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]]'s attempt to challenge US supremacy in the European film arena, taking advantage of the introduction of sound. As such, the studio released the movie in three different language versions (MLV): in German, in French as ''Le congrès s'amuse'', and English as ''Congress Dances''. [[Lilian Harvey]] played in all three versions, as she spoke all languages ; [[Henri Garat]] replaced [[Willy Fritsch]] for the French and English versions.

Ufa spared no efforts: the cast reads like a who's who of German film, from the top billers of the day to heavy-weight comedians - even the supporting cast is made out of stars. The sets were lavish and top talent made up the entire technical cast.

Despite the ambition and the auspicious beginning, Ufa's challenge US' supremacy never materialized, both due to the strength of the Hollywood majors and to the constraints Germany's creative film and performers would suffer from 1933 onwards.

"This truffle of cinema unfolds its flavours like a heavenly feast for the anonymous millions it is dedicated to." ''Lichtbild-Bühne''.

==Plot==

''Der Kongress tanzt'' takes place during the [[Congress of Vienna]], that took place in 1814/1815 after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a meeting between the powers that was to set the frontiers of the world.

[[Russia]]'s [[Tsar]] Alexander is traveling incognito among the people in the tradition of his ancestor [[Peter the Great]], coming across a witty and charming Viennese glove seller, the young Christel Weinzinger. She announces her business by throwing flowers with a visiting card into each carriage that drives past. As the story unfolds, Christel is accused of an assassination attempt and finally condemned. The punishment is however waived and Christel is again free.

The Tsar, having fallen in love with Christel, uses the visiting card, in order to visit her in her business. A romance develops, with [[Prince Metternich]] and his army of spies intending to use the situation to further his own agenda. This however clashes with Pepi, his secretary, who is also in love with Christel. Christel tells her friends about the romance, which is naturally not believed. Only as the Tsar arrives with a splendid carriage to fetch her, does astonishment set in.

The romance is terminated when [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] escapes from the island of Elba and marches upon Paris. The Tsar, as all other rulers, has to leave. Christel stays behind, miserable, but finds solace with Pepi.

[[File:Post-and-Grant-Avenue-Look.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins from the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], remembered as one of the worst [[natural disaster]]s in the history of the [[United States]].]]

A '''disaster''' is a serious disruption, occurring over a relatively short time, of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.&lt;ref name="ifrc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=What is a disaster?|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/what-is-a-disaster/|website=www.ifrc.org|publisher=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EHA"&gt;{{Cite paper |date=March 2002 |title=Disasters &amp; Emergencies: Definitions |url=http://apps.who.int/disasters/repo/7656.pdf |language=en-GB-oxendict|location=[[Addis Ababa]]|publisher=Emergency Humanitarian Action |access-date=2017-11-26 |via=World Health Organization International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary academia, disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately [[risk management|managed risk]]. These risks are the product of a combination of both hazards and vulnerability. Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters, as in the case of uninhabited regions.&lt;ref name=quarantelli&gt;Quarantelli E.L. (editor) "Where We Have Been and Where We Might Go", ''What is a Disaster?: A Dozen Perspectives on the Question'', London, Routledge, 1 edition 1998, pp.146–159&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits&amp;nbsp;– more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of [[GDP]]) in [[developing countries]] than in [[industrialized countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTDISMGMT/0,,menuPK:341021~pagePK:149018~piPK:149093~theSitePK:341015,00.html|title= World Bank: Disaster Risk Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros. [http://54pesos.org/2008/10/04/who%e2%80%99s-getting-the-worst-of-natural-disasters/ "Who’s getting the worst of natural disasters?"] 54Pesos.org, 4 October 2008  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903043315/http://54pesos.org/2008/10/04/who%E2%80%99s-getting-the-worst-of-natural-disasters |date=3 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''disaster'' is derived from Middle [[French language|French]] ''désastre'' and that from Old [[Italian language|Italian]] ''disastro'', which in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[pejorative]] prefix δυσ-, (''dus-'') "bad"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2328613|title= Dus, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ἀστήρ (''aster''), "star".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2316528|title= Aster, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root of the word ''disaster'' ("bad star" in Greek) comes from an [[astrology|astrological]] sense of a calamity blamed on the position of planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etymonline.com/?term=disaster "Disaster"] in Etymology online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
Researchers have been studying disasters for more than a century, and for more than forty years [[disaster research]]. The studies reflect a common opinion when they argue that all disasters can be seen as being human-made, their reasoning being that human actions before the strike of the hazard can prevent it developing into a disaster. All disasters are hence the result of human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.&lt;ref name=atrisk&gt;Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis &amp; Ben Wisner. ''At Risk – Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters'', Wiltshire: Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-25216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazards are routinely divided into natural or human-made, although complex disasters, where there is no single root cause, are more common in [[developing country|developing countries]]. A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an [[earthquake]] that causes a [[tsunami]], resulting in coastal [[flooding]].

===Natural disaster===
{{Main article| Natural disaster}}

A natural disaster is a natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

Various phenomena like [[earthquakes]], [[landslides]], [[volcanic eruptions]], floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones are all natural hazards that kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[Landform|landforms]], coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]]. [[Asia]] tops the list of casualties caused by natural hazards.
[[Image:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]

===Man-made disasters===
{{Main article|Anthropogenic hazard}}
Human-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills and nuclear explosions/radiation. War and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category. As with natural hazards, man-made hazards are events that have not happened—for instance, terrorism. Man-made disasters are examples of specific cases where man-made hazards have become reality in an event.

Donald Leslie Hancock (known as '''Don Hancock''') (5 January 1937 – 1 September 2001) was a [[Western Australian]] policeman involved in issues with investigating the [[Perth Mint Swindle]].

He was born in [[Boulder, Western Australia|Boulder]], Western Australia on 5 January 1937 to Leslie John Hancock and Melba May (nee Bourke).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Births|work=[[Kalgoorlie Miner]]|date=6 January 1937|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the family's gold mine at Grant's Patch near [[Ora Banda, Western Australia|Ora Banda]] before joining the [[Western Australian Police]] in 1959. Initially part of the Gold Stealing Detection Squad, he transferred to the Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB) in 1966. He worked in various detective branches before becoming officer-in-charge of the CIB in 1989, and retiring on 28 January 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Don Hancock Tribute|author=Police Union of Western Australia|date=6 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired to Ora Banda to run the historic inn.

In the book ''Mickelberg Stitch'', author [[Avon Lovell]] captioned a photograph of him with the name ''The Grey Fox''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Lovell, Avon | title=The Mickelberg stitch | publication-date=2002 | publisher=Creative Research | edition=2nd. | isbn=978-0-908469-25-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was killed on 1 September 2001 in [[Lathlain, Western Australia|Lathlain]] by a bomb placed under his car.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Police Journal - https://apjl.com.au/articles/the_murder_of_don_hancock&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Lewandowski, a fellow police colleague, committed suicide on 18 May 2004. Before his death, he had identified himself and Hancock as culpable in the setting up of the Mickelbergs in the Perth Mint Swindle.&lt;ref&gt;See page 243 of the book by [[Avon Lovell]] - {{Citation | author1=Lovell, Avon | title=Litany of lies : a true story of gold heists, bombings, feral cops, greed, murder &amp; revenge | publication-date=2010 | publisher=bookscope.com.au | isbn=978-0-9808715-0-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emil Josef Clade''' (26 February 1916 – May 2010)&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationartprints.com/aircraft_aces.php?PilotID=3770|date=2012|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=edxbwDcvTkMC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Emil+Clade%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Emil%20Clade%22&amp;f=false The Star of Africa: The Story of Hans Marseille, the Rogue Luftwaffe Ace Who Dominated the WWII Skies], Colin D. Heaton &amp; Anne-Marie Lewis, page 201&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Luftwaffe]] [[fighter ace]] in [[World War II]], and figured in German civilian aviation after the war. Enlisting in the Luftwaffe in 1937, prior to World War II, Clade served throughout the war as a fighter pilot in the Western and African fronts. Clade is credited with either 26 or 27 aircraft kills, and was shot down himself six times. He commanded the flight that shot down the transport of British [[Lieutenant General]] [[William Gott]], the newly appointed Commander of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British 8th Army]].

==Early life==
Clade was born in Hambach, now part of [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße]] in [[Rhineland-Palatinate|Rheinland-Pfalz]]. After completing his schooling, he originally trained to become a merchant. However, he became interested in aviation in 1934, and became a glider pilot, participating in the German national civilian aviator’s competition.

==Military career==
Joining the [[Luftwaffe]] in April 1937, Clade was initially certified to fly the [[Junkers Ju 52]]. However, he quickly moved to become a fighter pilot.

==World War II==
Clade served with 1./[[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War 2)|JG 1]], flying the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]. He scored his first kill on 11 May 1940 near [[Maastricht]], [[Netherlands]] against a [[Belgian Air Force]] [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplane of 1/I/2.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=6oWuCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=%22Emil+Clade%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Emil%20Clade%22&amp;f=false The Silent Attack: The Taking of the Bridges at Veldwezelt, Vroenhoven and Hanne 1940], By Oscar Gonzalez, Thomas Steinke, Ian Tannahill, page 288&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of the same day, he claimed a French [[Lioré et Olivier LeO 451|LeO 451]] twin-engine bomber of GB I/12 or GB II/12, also in the Maastricht area. Victories over an RAF Spitfire and Morane MS.406 followed in May and June 1940. Encountering [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s for the first time over Dunkirk, Clade was impressed saying that the British fighters were almost the Germans' equals. During the [[Battle of Britain]], Clade flew approximately 80 combat missions over Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=7yo2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22Emil+Clade%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Clade&amp;f=false Alarmstart: The German Fighter Pilot's Experience in the Second World War], Patrick G. Eriksson&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1941, Clade was made an instructor attached to [[JG 27|Jagdgeschwader 27]] into which 1./JG 1 had been merged, and stayed with this fighter unit for essentially all his remaining wartime career.

By now an ''oberfeldwebel'', Clade was assigned to the Mediterranean theatre with 5./JG 27, operating from bases in North Africa alongside legendary "Star of Africa" [[Hans-Joachim Marseille]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=edxbwDcvTkMC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Emil+Clade%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Emil%20Clade%22&amp;f=false The Star of Africa: The Story of Hans Marseille, the Rogue Luftwaffe Ace Who Dominated the WWII Skies], Colin D. Heaton &amp; Anne-Marie Lewis, page 51, 57, 135-136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=o_PkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Emil+Clade%22&amp;dq=%22Emil+Clade%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y Fighters over the desert: the air battles in the Western Desert, June 1940 to December 1942], Hans Ring, 1969, pages 78, 242&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 August 1942, he indirectly made a potentially decisive impact on the future course of the African campaign, although he was most likely unaware of the fact at the time. Airborne over the desert south of [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]], he chanced upon a [[Bristol Bombay]] transport of [[No. 216 Squadron RAF]], flown by 19-year-old Sergeant Pilot H.E. 'Jimmy' James, who was flying [[Lieutenant General]] [[William Gott]], the newly appointed Commander of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British 8th Army]], to a staff meeting in [[Cairo]]. The plane was also carrying a number of wounded British soldiers. Clade’s attack forced the transport to crash land and the subsequent strafing run by fellow JG 27 pilot Bernd Schneider killed Gott and most other British troops inside the wreckage on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/squadron-leader-hugh-james-pilot-whose-plane-was-shot-down-carrying-strafer-gott-leading-to-10157161.html Squadron Leader Hugh James: Pilot whose plane was shot down carrying ‘Strafer’ Gott, leading to Montgomery’s hour of glory], Independent, 5 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OYZsBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=%22Emil+Clade%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Emil%20Clade%22&amp;f=false Strafer Desert General: The Life and Killing of Lieutenant General William Gott], N.S.

While still flying in [[Egypt]], having been promoted to ''Leutnant'', Clade recorded his 10th air claim on 5 July 1942 when he shot down an RAF Spitfire fighter near El-Daba.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=edxbwDcvTkMC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Emil+Clade%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Emil%20Clade%22&amp;f=false The Star of Africa: The Story of Hans Marseille, the Rogue Luftwaffe Ace Who Dominated the WWII Skies], Colin D. Heaton &amp; Anne-Marie Lewis, page 132&lt;/ref&gt; With 17 air victories to his credit, Clade was appointed ''Staffelkapitän'' of 7./JG 27 on 23 May 1943.

By January 1945, Clade was acting ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' of III./JG 27, and lead the [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–45)#Gruppe|Gruppe]] in combat in [[Operation Bodenplatte]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=m1QgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Emil+Clade%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Clade The Battle of the Airfields: 1st January 1945], Norman L. R. Franks, 1982, page 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Clade led the gruppe an escort mission against Utrecht. In a subsequent airfield attack against Melsbroek, Clade said the AAA positions were not manned, and aircraft were bunched together or in lines, which made perfect targets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=J2VEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA484&amp;dq=%22Emil+Clade%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Emil%20Clade%22&amp;f=false The Ardennes, 1944-1945], Christer Bergstrom, page 328&lt;/ref&gt; The attack caused considerable damage among the units based there and was a great success. The Recce Wings had lost two entire squadrons worth of machines. [[No. 69 Squadron RAF]] lost 11 [[Vickers Wellington]]s and two damaged. [[No. 140 Squadron RAF]] lost four Mosquitoes, the losses being made good the same day.&lt;ref name="140 Squadron RAF, May 1941 - May 1945"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jshawmsc.f2s.com/140squadron.pdf |title=140 Squadron RAF, May 1941 – May 1945 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=J F Seward, J Shaw |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least five Spitfires from [[No. 16 Squadron RAF]] were destroyed.

Clade and his fellow Gruppenkommandeur [[Peter Werfft]] disbanded the remainder of their unit near [[Saalbach-Hinterglemm|Saalbach]] between 3 May and 8 May 1945 and became prisoners of war.&lt;ref name="WealAfrika"&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=dbzvCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT224&amp;dq=%22Emil+Clade%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Emil%20Clade%22&amp;f=false Jagdgeschwader 27 ‘Afrika’], John Weal&lt;/ref&gt; Clade finished the war as with the rank of ''Hauptmann'', and was credited with 27 victories, including two four-engine bombers. Nine claims were made over the Western Front, with the remainder being in North Africa.

Clade was himself shot down six times, including in aerial combat on 5 October 1943 (during a mission resulting in his 18th victory), on 26 November 1944 and on 25 February 1945 (immediately after his 27th and last air kill). He also sustained severe injuries in a [[French Resistance|Resistance]] attack on 16 February 1944 when he was serving in [[France]] near [[Avignon]].&lt;ref name="GluckGehabt"&gt;Clade, Emil.

==Postwar career==
Clade survived in various minor jobs after his release from a prisoner of war camp. He applied to become a civilian pilot with the newly formed [[Lufthansa]] in 1956 but was turned down because he exceeded the age limit by two years. However, he continued as a private aviator, was successful in various German competitions, and helped setting up local aviation associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alteadler.de/aktuell/jubilaeen/clade.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022085922/http://alteadler.de/aktuell/jubilaeen/clade.html |archivedate=October 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epifanije Stefanović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Епифаније Стефановић}}) was the alleged Serbian Orthodox Archbishop of Dalmatia, who in 1648 entered [[Eastern Catholic Churches|communion with the Catholic Church]], mentioned only by Venetian ecclesiastical historian [[Daniele Farlati]] (1690–1773). According to research of Serbian Orthodox bishop [[Nikodim Milaš]] (1845–1915), the entry was proved to be a [[hoax]].

==Life==
According to [[Daniele Farlati]] (1690–1773), during the [[Cretan War (1645–69)]], in November 1648, Archbishop Stefanović and two of his bishops, Vasilije and Isaija, and 80 (or 800) monks entered [[Eastern Catholic Churches|communion with the Catholic Church]], thanks to a Franciscan.&lt;ref name="Milaš1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikodim Milaš|title=Pravoslavna Dalmacija: istorijski pregled|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyocAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Sfairos|page=223|quote=Фарлати наводи како је заслугом једнога францишканца обраћен био у латинску вјеру у новембру 1648. год. далматински архијепископ Епифаније Стефановић и још два подручна му епископа, Василије и Исаија, затијем 80 (или ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been refuted by the research of [[Nikodim Milaš]] (1845–1915), as, firstly, history knows of no such archbishop, and secondly, the Orthodox community at that time strongly resisted Catholic propaganda, supporting the [[Serbian Patriarch Maksim I]] through the emissary monk Kiril.&lt;ref name="Popović1912"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jevsevije Popović|title=Od 1054 do 1912|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5TlAAQAAMAAJ|year=1912|publisher=Srpska manastirska štamparija|page=622|quote=Фарлати пише, да је 1648. далматински архиепископ Епифаније Стефановић са два епископа и са масом народа и свештенства примио римокатолицизам (ad Romanam Ecclesiam accessio facta est). Та је вест међутим на основу истраживања епископа Никодима Милаша неистинита, прво зато, што историја не зна за таквог архиепископа, а друго зато, што се у то доба римокатоличкој пропаганди силно опирао православни народ, кога у том опирању подржаваше пећски патријарх Максим преко свога изасланика монаха Кирила.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mile Bogović, the current [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Gospić-Senj|Catholic bishop of Gospić-Senj]], after the subsequent death of Stefanović, the monks turned against the Catholic Church, thus the Uniatism of these Dalmatian Serbs failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/15465505/Mile-Bogovic-Katolicka-Crkva-i-Pravoslavlje-u-Dalmaciji|author=Mile Bogović|title=Katolička crkva i pravoslavlje u Dalmaciji za vrijeme mletačke vladavine|location=Zagreb|year=1993|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1969''' was the 14th in the series.

Four countries (the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands and France) won the contest, the first time ever a tie had occurred.  However, there was no rule at the time to cover such an eventuality, so all four countries were declared joint winners.&lt;ref name=ESC1969&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1969|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|publisher=[[EBU]]|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's win was their fourth. France became the first country to win the contest four times. The Netherlands' win was their third. Spain and the United Kingdom each won for the second time. And it was the first time that any country (Spain, in this case) had a winning ESC entry two years in a row. This is so far the only occasion Spain has hosted the contest.

== Location ==
[[File:Teatro Real de Madrid - 02.jpg|thumb|left|Teatro Real, Madrid – host venue of the 1969 contest.]]
The venue selected to host the 1969 contest was the Teatro Real, an opera house located in [[Madrid]]. The theatre reopened in 1966 as a concert theatre and the main concert venue of the [[Spanish National Orchestra]] and the [[RTVE Symphony Orchestra]]. The final featured an onstage metal sculpture created by surrealist Spanish artist, [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref name="Cultural Institutions: Teatro Real"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=esMADRID.com | url=http://www.esmadrid.com/en/portal.do?IDM=440&amp;NM=3&amp;TR=C&amp;IDR=653 | title=Cultural Institutions: Teatro Real  | accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
The [[surrealist]] Spanish artist [[Salvador Dalí]] was responsible for designing the [[publicity]] material for the 1969 contest as well as the metal sculpture which was used on stage.&lt;ref name=ESC1969 /&gt;

It was the first time that the contest resulted in a tie for first place, with four countries each gaining 18 votes. Since there was at the time no rule to cover such an eventuality, all four countries were declared joint winners. This caused an unfortunate problem concerning the medals due to be distributed to the winners as there were not enough to go round, so that only the [[singer]]s received their medals on the night: the [[songwriter]]s, to some disgruntlement, were not awarded theirs until after the date of the contest.&lt;ref name=ESC1969 /&gt;

Had the later tie-break rule been in place (the country receiving the highest score from any other country, as used in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]]), the Netherlands would have won, having received 6 points from France. United Kingdom would then have been runner up, having received 5 points from Sweden.   On the other hand, with the ''present'' tie-break rule been in place (i.e. the song receiving votes from the ''most'' countries, ''then'' the song receiving the most high votes in case of another tie), [[France]] would have been the overall winner, with Spain in 2nd place. Both countries received votes from 9 countries, but France received 4 points from 2 countries whereas Spain received 3 points as their highest vote.

== Participating countries ==
{{Further|List of countries in the Eurovision Song Contest}}
[[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austria]] was absent from the contest&lt;ref name=ESC1969 /&gt;, officially because they could not find a suitable representative &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Eurovisionsfest ohne Österreich|url=http://www.arbeiter-zeitung.at/cgi-bin/archiv/flash.pl?year=1969&amp;month=1&amp;day=15&amp;page=09&amp;html=1|work=Arbeiter-Zeitung|location=Vienna, Austria|date=15 January 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but it was rumoured that they refused to participate in a contest staged in [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]-ruled Spain.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=John Kennedy|year=2005|title=The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wales]] wanted to debut with Welsh language broadcaster [[BBC Cymru]], and also made a national selection called [[Cân i Gymru]], but in the end it was decided they would not participate in the competition – their participation was rejected because Wales is not a [[sovereign state]]. Only the [[BBC]] has the exclusive right to represent the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969|United Kingdom]].

The '''Ghouta chemical attack''' occurred in [[Ghouta]], Syria during the [[Syrian Civil War]], in the early hours of 21 August 2013. Two [[Syrian opposition|opposition]]-controlled areas in the suburbs around [[Damascus]], Syria were struck by [[rocket artillery|rockets]] containing the [[chemical weapons|chemical]] agent [[sarin]].

The attack came one year and one day after US President [[Barack Obama]]'s 20 August 2012 "[[Red line (phrase)|red line]]" remarks, in which he warned: "We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.

===Khan al-Assal chemical attack===
{{main|Khan al-Assal chemical attack}}
The Khan al-Assal chemical attack occurred on 19 March 2013, when a government-controlled area of [[Khan al-Asal]], a district of [[Aleppo]] in northern Syria, was struck by a rocket containing the nerve agent sarin. According to the [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] the attack resulted in at least 26 fatalities, including 16 government soldiers and 10 civilians.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnard|first=Anne|title=Syria and Activists Trade Charges on Chemical Weapons|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/world/middleeast/syria-developments.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian government later reported to the United Nations that one soldier and 19 civilians died and that 17 soldiers and 107 civilians were injured.&lt;ref name="The Final UN report" /&gt;{{rp|page=32}} A medic at the local civilian hospital said he personally had witnessed Syrian army soldiers helping the wounded and dealing with fatalities at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria chemical weapons: finger pointed at jihadists |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9950036/Syria-chemical-weapons-finger-pointed-at-jihadists.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent International Commission of Inquiry===
{{main article|Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic}}
The [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] established the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic on 22 August 2011 to investigate [[human rights violations during the Syrian civil war]]. One of the topics the commission investigated was possible use of chemical weapons. In early June 2013, the Fifth Report of the Commission of Inquiry stated that there were reasonable grounds to believe that toxic chemicals were used in four attacks, but more evidence was needed "to determine the precise chemical agents used, their delivery systems or the perpetrator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/A-HRC-23-58_en.pdf |title=5th Report of Commission of Inquiry on Syria – A/HRC/23/58 |publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2015}} [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session23/Pages/ListReports.aspx Final version dated 18 July 2013 found on this page.

===Assessments prior to the attack===

====US assessment====
US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel stated on 25 April that US intelligence showed the Assad government had likely used [[sarin]] on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=5229 |title=Media Availability with Secretary Hagel in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates|work=U.S. Department of Defense |date=25 April 2013 |accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the White House announced that "much more" work had to be done to verify the intelligence assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-29/obama-aide-says-more-work-needed-to-verify-syria-chemical-use.html|title=Carney Says More Work Needed to Verify Syria Chemical Use|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=1 May 2013|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|first1=Mike|last1=Dorning|first2=David|last2=Lerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 June 2013, the United States government publicly announced it had concluded that the Assad government had used limited amounts of chemical weapons on multiple occasions against rebel forces, killing 100 to 150 people. US officials stated that [[sarin]] was the agent used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/world/middleeast/white-house-pushes-back-on-bill-clintons-syria-remarks.html |title=Syria Has Used Chemical Arms on Rebels, U.S. and Allies Find |work=The New York Times |date=13 June 2013 |first1=Mark |last1=Mazzetti |first2=Michael R. |last2=Gordon |first3=Mark |last3=Landler |accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy National Security Advisor [[Ben Rhodes (speechwriter)|Ben Rhodes]] did not say whether this showed that Syria had crossed the "red line" established by President Obama in August 2012.

====Russian assessment====
Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] said "the accusations of Damascus using chemical weapons put forth by the United States are not backed by credible facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/14/world/la-fg-us-syria-20130615 |title=Getting U.S. weapons to Syria rebels will take weeks |first1=Paul |last1=Richter |first2=Christi |last2=Parsons |first3=David S. |last3=Cloud |work=Los Angeles Times |date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lavrov further stated that the Syrian government had no motive to use chemical weapons since the government already maintained a military advantage over the rebel fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/russia-expresses-doubts-on-syrias-chemical-weapons-use/a-16885053|title=Russia expresses doubts on Syria's chemical weapons use|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=15 June 2013|accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 8, and possibly 12, [[Rocket (weapon)|rockets]] struck within a 1500 by 500-meter area in the [[Zamalka]] and nearby [[Ein Tarma]] neighborhoods.{{refn |group=note |In their report ''Attacks on Ghouta'', [[Human Rights Watch]] states: "Witness statements and information including GPS locations of rockets found in the area provided by local activists, as well as satellite imagery locations that match the location in the videos, have allowed Human Rights Watch to confirm at least four strike sites in Zamalka where at least eight 330mm rockets struck on August 21.

===Western Ghouta attack===
The second attack took place in the Western Ghouta area around 5:00 in the morning on 21 August. On 22 August, a witness who works for [[Moadamiyet al-Sham media centre|Moadamiya media center]] said he had counted seven rockets that fell in two areas of [[Muadamiyat al-Sham|Moadamiya]] during the early morning of 21 August. He said four rockets hit next to the Rawda Mosque and another three in the area between Qahweh Street and Zeytouneh Street, which he said was approximately 500 meters to the east of the Rawda Mosque. He said all the rockets were of the same type.&lt;ref name="HrwPublication"/&gt;

While no chemical warhead was ever found in the Western Ghouta area, one rocket engine has been identified as a [[BM-14#Ammunition|140mm M-14 unguided surface-to-surface rocket]]. This type of rocket can be fitted with three types of warheads: high explosive-fragmentation, white phosphorus smoke, or a chemical warhead containing {{convert|2|liter|sp=us}} of sarin.&lt;ref name="HrwPublication"/&gt;{{rp|page=5}} None of the 13 environmental samples taken from Western Ghouta tested positive for sarin, although three had "degradation and/or by-products."&lt;ref name="The Final UN report" /&gt;{{rp|pages=43–45}}

==Chemical weapons capability==

At the time of the attack, Syria was not a party to the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Member State – Syria |url=http://www.opcw.org/about-opcw/member-states/member-states-by-region/asia/member-state-syria/ |publisher=[[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] |accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons, although in 1968 it acceded to the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases.

According to French intelligence, the [[Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center]] (SSRC) is responsible for producing toxic agents for use in war. A group named "Branch 450" is allegedly responsible for filling munitions with chemicals and maintaining security of the chemical agent stockpiles.&lt;ref name=GuardianFrenchDossier /&gt; As of September 2013, French intelligence estimated the Syrian stockpile at 1,000 tonnes, including [[Yperite]], [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] and "several hundred tonnes of sarin."&lt;ref name=GuardianFrenchDossier/&gt;

The UK's [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] publicly dismissed the possibility of rebel responsibility for the attack in Ghouta, stating that rebels are incapable of an attack of its scale.&lt;ref name=addsnothing /&gt; The Committee stated that "there is no credible intelligence or evidence to substantiate the claims or the possession of CW by the opposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/29/world/europe/syria-civil-war/index.html |title=Official: U.S. may take unilateral action against Syria |publisher=CNN |date=30 August 2013 |accessdate=1 April 2016 |first=Matt |last=Smith |first2=Chelsea J. |last2=Carter |first3=Frederik |last3=Pleitgen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial claims==
Both the opposition and the Syrian government said a chemical attack was carried out in the suburbs around Damascus on 21 August 2013. Anti-government activists said the Syrian government was to blame for the attack, while the Syrian government said foreign fighters and their international backers were to blame.&lt;ref name="allege" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt;

===Opposition claims===
On the day of the attack, [[George Sabra]], the head of the [[Syrian National Council]], said 1,300 people had been killed as shells loaded with poisonous gas rained down on the capital's eastern suburbs of [[Douma, Syria|Douma]], [[Jobar]], [[Zamalka]], [[Arbin, Syria|Arbeen]] and [[Ein Tarma]].&lt;ref name="telegraph1" /&gt; A spokesman for the Free Syrian Army's [[Supreme Military Council (Syria)|Supreme Military Council]], [[Qassim Saadeddine]], said, "people are growing desperate as they watch another round of political statements and UN meetings without any hope of action."&lt;ref name="reuters1" /&gt; [[Ahmad Jarba]], who was the president of the [[Syrian National Coalition]] at the time of the attack, called on the UN investigators to travel to "the site of the massacre" and for an urgent [[United Nations Security Council]] meeting on the subject.&lt;ref name=Arabiya /&gt; The [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] said the attack was committed by the Syrian regime and called on [[Ban Ki-moon]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], "to apply all pressure within his powers to pressure the Syrian regime."&lt;ref name="murky"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/21/world/meast/syria-chemical-weapons-questions/index.html |title=Suffering in Syria is clear, but cause and culprits are murky |first=Tim |last=Lister |publisher=CNN |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, a spokesman for the [[Syrian National Coalition]], Khaled al-Saleh, said at least six doctors died after treating victims, and that they didn't yet have the number of dead first responders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Oren Dorell|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/22/syria-chemical-attack-responders-die/2686971/|title=Rebels: Syrian medics die after treating attack victims|work=USA Today|date=23 August 2013|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Iranian chemical weapons expert, Abbas Foroutan, said in October 2013 that the UN should publish more details about the investigation than were provided in the report, including victims' pulse rates and blood pressure and their response to the atropine treatment, the victims' levels of [[acetylcholinesterase]] (sarin is an [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]) and more technical details on the lab testing process.&lt;ref&gt;Foroutan's work was reviewed in ''[[Neurology (journal)|Neurology]]'' in 2004 [http://www.neurology.org/content/62/9/1590.short by a US Army chemical weapons expert], and described as "the only firsthand clinical descriptions of battlefield nerve agent casualties in the world literature". – Sharmine Narwani and Radwan Mortada, mideastshuffle.com, 1 October 2010, [http://mideastshuffle.com/2013/10/01/cw-expert-opinion-on-the-un-report-on-syria/ CW Expert Opinion on the UN Report on Syria]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edc.sbmu.ac.ir/uploads/Comments-un-report-on-syria-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final UN Mission report===
The UN inspection team returned to Syria to continue investigations into other alleged chemical attacks in late September 2013.
A final report on Ghouta and six other alleged attacks (including three alleged to have occurred after the Ghouta attack) was released in December 2013.&lt;ref name=Gladstone20131003 /&gt; The inspectors wrote that they "collected clear and convincing evidence that chemical weapons were used also against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale in the Ghouta area of Damascus on 21 August 2013." The conclusion was based on:
*Impacted and exploded surface-to-surface rockets, capable to carry a chemical payload, were found to contain sarin;
*Close to the rocket impact sites, in the area where patients were affected, the environment was found to be contaminated by sarin;
*The epidemiology of over fifty interviews given by survivors and health care workers provided ample corroboration of the medical and scientific results;
*A number of patients/survivors were clearly diagnosed as intoxicated by an organophosphorous compound;
*Blood and urine samples from the same patients were found positive for sarin and sarin signatures.&lt;ref name="The Final UN report" /&gt;{{rp|page=19}}

===UN Human Rights Council report===

The 7th Report of the [[Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic]], a different group than the UN fact-finding mission, stated the sarin used in the Ghouta attack bore the "same unique hallmarks" as the sarin used in the [[Khan al-Assal chemical attack|Khan al-Assal attack]]. The report, dated 12 February 2014, also indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military. These conclusions were based on the fact-finding mission's evidence, as the Commission of Inquiry did not conduct its own investigation of either chemical attack.&lt;ref name="Human rights" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The continuous fighting has severely limited the quality of medical care for injured survivors of the attack. A month after the attack, approximately 450 survivors still required medical attention for lingering symptoms such as respiratory and vision problems.&lt;ref name=Morris20130920&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Loveday|last2=Luck|first2=Taylor|title=A month after chemical attacks, Syrian residents of Ghouta struggle to survive|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-20/world/42249394_1_side-effects-zamalka-chemical-attack|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early October 2013, the 13,000 residents of Moadhamiya, one of the places targeted in the August attack, had been surrounded by pro-government forces and under siege for five months. Severe malnourishment and medical emergencies become pressing as all supply lines had stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Syria massacre: troops 'starve gas attack town' – video |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/moadhamiya-massacre-hezbollah-iran-assad-attack-video |work=Channel 4 News |date=6 October 2013 |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Care for chronic symptoms of sarin exposure had become "just one among a sea of concerns."&lt;ref name=Morris20130920 /&gt;

As countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom debated their response to the attacks, they encountered significant popular and legislative resistance to military intervention. In particular, British Prime Minister David Cameron's request to the House of Commons to use military force was declined by a 285–272 margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British Prime Minister David Cameron loses parliamentary vote on Syrian military strike |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/british-prime-minister-david-cameron-loses-parliamentary-vote-on-syrian-military-strike/2013/08/29/4fabb080-10f7-11e3-bdf6-e4fc677d94a1_story.html |first=Anthony |last=Faiola |accessdate=29 April 2015 |work=The Washington Post |date=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British lawmakers reject reprisal strike against Syria |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/29/world/la-fg-britain-syria-20130830 |first=Henry  |last=Chu |accessdate=29 April 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK government policy subsequently focused on providing humanitarian assistance inside Syria and to refugees in neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UK to press United Nations on Syria aid |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/27/syria-aid-united-nations-william-hague |accessdate=29 April 2015 |work=The Guardian |date=27 June 2014 |agency=Press Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===Domestic===
Information Minister [[Omran al-Zoubi]] was quoted by the official state [[news agency]], [[Syrian Arab News Agency]] (SANA), as saying that the government did not and would not use such weapons, if in fact they even existed. Al-Zoubi said, "everything that has been said is absurd, primitive, illogical and fabricated. What we say is what we mean: there is no use of such things (chemical weapons) at all, at least not by the Syrian army or the Syrian state, and it's easy to prove and it is not that complicated."&lt;ref name="gagging"&gt;{{cite news |first=Samira |last=Said |first2=Ashley |last2=Fantz |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/21/world/meast/syria-civil-war/index.html |title=Syrian activists: Videos show chemical weapons used |publisher=CNN |accessdate=30 June 2015 |date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SANA called the reports of chemical attacks as "untrue and designed to derail the ongoing UN inquiry." A Syrian military official appeared on state television denouncing the reports as "a desperate opposition attempt to make up for rebel defeats on the ground."&lt;ref name="allege"/&gt; Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad declared it a tactic by the rebels to turn around the civil war which he said "they were losing" and that, though the government had admitted to having stocks of chemical weapons, stated they would never be used "inside Syria".&lt;ref name="BBC-WWK"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23927399 |title=Syria chemical attacks: What we know |publisher=BBC |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|Democratic Union Party]] leader [[Salih Muslim]] said he doubted that the Syrian government carried out the chemical attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-08-26-kurdish-pyd-leader-assad-is-not-to-blame |title=Assad is not to blame for Syria chemical attacks, says Kurdish party leader |work=Mail &amp; Guardian |accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international community is thus complicit in these crimes because of its [polarisation], silence and inability to work on a settlement that would lead to the end of the daily bloodshed in Syria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/21/world/meast/syria-civil-war/index.html|title=Syrian activists: Videos show chemical weapons used|date=21 August 2013|accessdate=20 September 2013|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international community condemned the attacks. United States President [[Barack Obama]] said the US military should strike targets in Syria to retaliate for the government's purported use of chemical weapons, a proposal publicly supported by French President [[François Hollande]], but condemned by Russia and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/30/france-act-on-syria-without-britain-hollande|work=The Guardian|date=30 August 2013|accessdate=31 August 2013|title=France could act on Syria without Britain, says François Hollande}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/iran-prevent-military-strike-syria-20102934|publisher=ABC News|title=Iran to Work With Russia to Stop Strike on Syria|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arab League]] stated it would support military action against Syria in the event of UN support, though member states Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, and Tunisia opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arab League urges UN-backed action in Syria|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/09/20139118235327617.html|accessdate=5 September 2013|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of August, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] voted against military intervention in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23892783|title=Syria crisis: Cameron loses Commons vote on Syria action|date=30 August 2013|accessdate=18 September 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early September, the [[United States Congress]] began debating a proposed [[Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against the Government of Syria to Respond to Use of Chemical Weapons (S.J.Res 21)|authorisation to use military force]], although votes on the resolution were indefinitely postponed amid opposition from many legislators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/09/09/obama-congress-syria-vote-in-doubt/2788597/ |work=USA TODAY |first=Susan  |last=Davis |title=Senate delays Syria vote as Obama loses momentum |date=10 September 2013 |accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tentative agreement between Obama and Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] on an [[Agreement to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons|alternative proposal]], under which Syria would declare and surrender its chemical weapons to be destroyed under international supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/world/middleeast/syria-talks.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|title=U.S. and Russia Reach Deal to Destroy Syria's Chemical Arms|date=14 September 2013|accessdate=18 September 2013|first=Michael R.|last=Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Analysis of symptoms====
Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior associate for the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said the reported symptoms are a textbook case of nerve-agent poisoning.&lt;ref name="Nerve Agents"/&gt;

[[Médecins Sans Frontières]] Director of Operations Bart Janssens stated that MSF "can neither scientifically confirm the cause of these symptoms nor establish who is responsible for the attack. However, the reported symptoms of the patients, in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events – characterised by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and first aid workers – strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent."&lt;ref name="MSF_neurotoxic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria: Thousands suffering neurotoxic symptoms treated in hospitals supported by MSF |publisher=[[Médecins Sans Frontières]] |date=24 August 2013 |url=http://www.msf.org/article/syria-thousands-suffering-neurotoxic-symptoms-treated-hospitals-supported-msf |accessdate=24 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6J7b31jid?url=http://www.msf.org/article/syria-thousands-suffering-neurotoxic-symptoms-treated-hospitals-supported-msf |archivedate=24 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gwyn Winfield, editorial director at ''CBRNe World'', analysed some videos from the day of the attack and wrote on the magazine's website: "It is difficult to define [an] agent by the signs and symptoms. Clearly respiratory distress, some nerve spasms and a half-hearted washdown (involving water and bare hands?!), but it could equally be a riot control agent as a [chemical warfare agent]."&lt;ref name=cbrnevideo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbrneworld.com/news/attack_in_ghouta |title=Attack in Ghouta? |first=Gwyn |last=Winfield |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |work=CBRNe World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rockets===
[[File:16-tube multiple launch rocket.JPG|thumb|right|A [[BM-14|RPU-14]] multiple rocket launcher, of a type that may have launched M-14 munitions found by UN inspectors on 26 August at a site in [[Moadamiyah]].&lt;ref&gt;Joe Pappalardo, ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', 17 September 2013, [http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/the-story-of-syrias-chemical-artillery-15935885 The Story of Syria's Chemical Artillery]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Human Rights Watch]] reported that two types of rockets were used: in Western Ghouta, a 140mm rocket made in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1967 and exported to Syria;&lt;ref name="HrwPublication" /&gt;{{rp|page=5}} and in Eastern Ghouta, a 330mm rocket of unknown origin.&lt;ref name="HrwPublication" /&gt;{{rp|page=9}} HRW also reported that at the time of the attack, Syrian rebels were not known to be in possession of the rockets used.&lt;ref name="HrwPublication" /&gt;{{rp|page=20}}&lt;ref name="Syria: chemical attack evidence points to Assad"&gt;{{cite web|author=Julian Borger, diplomatic editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/syria-chemical-attack-assad |title=Syria: chemical attack evidence points to Assad, claims human rights group |work=The Guardian |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seymour Hersh has suggested that the 330mm rockets may have been produced locally, and with a limited range.&lt;ref name="WhoseSarinHersh"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/2013/12/08/seymour-m-hersh/whose-sarin |title=Whose sarin? |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=29 April 2015 |first=Seymour M. |last=Hersh |authorlink=Seymour Hersh |journal=London Review of Books |volume=35 |issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eliot Higgins]] has looked at the munitions linked to the attack and analysed footage of the putative launchers inside government territory.&lt;ref name=ChemicalMisfire&gt;{{cite news |first=Eliot |last=Higgins |title=Sy Hersh's Chemical Misfire |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/12/09/sy_hershs_chemical_misfire |work=Foreign Policy |date=9 December 2013 |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to analysis conducted in January 2014 by [[Theodore Postol]] and Richard Lloyd, of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the rockets used in the attack had a range of about two kilometers, which, the authors claimed, meant that the munitions could not have been fired from the 'heart' or from the Eastern edge of the Syrian Government Controlled Area shown in the Intelligence Map published by the White House on 30 August 2013.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Postol" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/01/15/214656/new-analysis-of-rocket-used-in.html |title=New analysis of rocket used in Syria chemical attack undercuts U.S. claims |work=McClatchy DC |date=15 January 2014 |first=Matthew |last=Schofield |accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewStudy&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/29/world/middleeast/new-study-refines-view-of-sarin-attack-in-syria.html |work=The New York Times |date=28 December 2013 |title=New Study Refines View of Sarin Attack in Syria |first=C.J. |last=Chivers |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A response from Higgins and Kaszeta included an observation that the Russian-language news site ANNA News had posted videos showing a Syrian government military operation running from June to August 2013 to clear positions between Jobar and Qaboun, a strip of land about 2&amp;nbsp;km away from 21 August impact sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/22/allegation-false-turkey-chemical-attack-syria |title=It's clear that Turkey was not involved in the chemical attack on Syria |date=22 April 2014 |first1=Eliot |last1=Higgins |first2=Dan |last2=Kaszeta |work=The Guardian |accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the munitions and their fragments had been moved; however, in two cases, the UN could identify the likely launch azimuths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24130181|title=Syria chemical attack: Key UN findings|publisher=BBC|date=17 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Triangulating rocket trajectories suggests that the origin of the attack may have been within government or rebel-held territory.

===Communications===
Two purported intercepts of communications that appeared to implicate the Syrian government received prominent media coverage. One was a phone call allegedly between Syrian officials which Israel's [[Unit 8200]] was said to have intercepted and passed to the US.&lt;ref name="intercepted"&gt;{{cite news |first=Harriet |last=Sherwood |work=The Guardian |date=28 August 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/28/israeli-intelligence-intercepted-syria-chemical-talk |title=Israeli intelligence 'intercepted Syrian regime talk about chemical attack' |accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was a phone call which the German [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]] said it had intercepted, between a high-ranking representative of [[Hezbollah]] and the Iranian embassy, in which the purported Hezbollah official said that poison gas had been used and that Assad's order to attack with chemical weapons had been a strategic error.&lt;ref name="GermanIntercept"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10284773/Syria-crisis-chemical-weapons-use-a-big-mistake-Hizbollah-told-Iran.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Syria crisis: 'chemical weapons use a big mistake, Hizbollah told Iran'|date=3 September 2013|accessdate=8 September 2013|location=London|first=Jeevan|last=Vasagar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fangt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/syrien-bnd-faengt-beleg-fuer-giftgaseinsatz-durch-assad-regime-ab-a-919965.html|work=Der Spiegel|title=BND fängt Beleg für Giftgaseinsatz durch Assad-Regime ab|date=2 September 2013|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August the [[Associated Press]] reported that, according to two U.S. intelligence officials and two other U.S. officials, the U.S. intercept was a conversation between "low-level" Syrian officials with no direct link to the upper echelons of the government or military.&lt;ref name=APnoslamdunk&gt;{{cite news |first=Kimberly |last=Dozier |first2=Matt |last2=Apuzzo |agency=Associated Press |date=29 August 2013 |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-sources-intelligence-weapons-no-slam-dunk |title=AP sources: Intelligence on weapons no 'slam dunk' |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Bild am Sonntag]]'' newspaper subsequently reported that German intelligence indicated that Assad had likely not ordered the attacks.&lt;ref name="Guardian8Sept"/&gt; According to ''Bild'', "intelligence interception specialists" relying on communications intercepted by the German vessel ''Oker'' said that Syrian military commanders had repeatedly been asking permission to launch chemical attacks for around four months, with permission always being denied from the presidential palace.

Murad Abu Bilal, Khaled Naddaf and other [[Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria]] and [[Local Coordination Committees of Syria]] (LCC) media staff went to Zamalka soon after the attacks to film and obtain other documentary evidence.

Experts who have analysed the first video said it shows the strongest evidence yet consistent with the use of a lethal toxic agent. Visible symptoms reportedly included rolling eyes, foaming at the mouth, and tremors. There was at least one image of a child suffering [[miosis]], the pin-point pupil effect associated with the nerve agent [[Sarin]], a powerful [[neurotoxin]] reportedly used before in Syria. Ralph Trapp, a former scientist at the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]], said the footage showed what a chemical weapons attack on a civilian area would look like, and went on to note "This is one of the first videos I've seen from Syria where the numbers start to make sense. If you have a gas attack you would expect large numbers of people, children and adults, to be affected, particularly if it's in a built-up area."&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Beaumont |first2=Ian |last2=Sample |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/21/syria-chemicals-weapons-experts-lethal-toxin |title=Chemical weapons experts say strike near Damascus fits with lethal toxin use |work=The Guardian |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts, among them Jean Pascal Zanders, initially stated that evidence that sarin was used, as claimed by pro-rebel sources, was still lacking and highlighted the lack of second-hand contaminations typically associated with use of weapons-grade nerve agents: "I remain sceptical that it was a nerve agent like sarin. I would have expected to see more convulsions," he said. "The other thing that seems inconsistent with sarin is that, given the footage of first responders treating victims without proper protective equipment, you would expect to see considerable secondary casualties from contamination – which does not appear to be evident." However, after Zanders saw footage imminently after the attack, he changed his mind, saying: "The video footage and pictures this time are of a far better quality. You can clearly see the typical signs of asphyxiation, including a pinkish blueish tinge to the skin colour. There is one image of an adult woman where you can see the tell-tale blackish mark around her mouth, all of which suggests death from asphyxiation."&lt;ref name="theguardian1" /&gt; Zanders however cautioned that these symptoms covered a range of neurotoxicants, including some available for civilian use as pest control agents, and said that until the UN reported its analysis of samples, "I can't make a judgement. I have to keep an open mind."&lt;ref&gt;[[Huffington Post]], 30 August 2013, [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/30/syria-sarin-claims_n_3843049.html?1377876797 Syria: Chemical Weapons Expert Jean Pascal Zanders Says Gas Might Not Be Sarin, Urges Caution]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', "videos uploaded to YouTube by activists showed rows of motionless bodies and medics attending to patients apparently in the grip of seizures. In one piece of footage, a young boy appeared to be foaming at the mouth while convulsing."&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Strange|first=Hannah|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10256236/Syrian-opposition-claims-1300-killed-in-chemical-attack.html|title=Syrian opposition claims 1,300 killed in chemical attack|work=The Telegraph|date=21 August 2013|accessdate=24 August 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia said there was no evidence tying the Syrian government to the attack and that it was likely carried out by an opposition group.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-09-17-russia-france-at-loggerheads-over-syria-finding|title=Russia, France at loggerheads over Syria report|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=17 September 2013|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
On 2 September, the French [[Cabinet of France|government]] published a nine-page intelligence report blaming the Syrian government for the Ghouta attacks.&lt;ref name=FrenchDossierEnglish /&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianFrenchDossier&gt;{{cite web |first=Kim |last=Willsher |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/syria-crisis-french-intelligence-assad |title=Syria crisis: French intelligence dossier blames Assad for chemical attack |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2013|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FrenchDossier&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elysee.fr/assets/pdf/SyrieSynthese-nationale-de-renseignement-declassifie02-09-2013.pdf |title=Programme chimique syrien |trans-title=Syrian chemical program |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unnamed French government official said that the analysis was carried out by the [[Directorate-General for External Security]] (DGSE) and [[Direction du renseignement militaire]] (DRM) based on satellite and video images, on-the-ground sources, and samples collected from two April attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=4 September 2013 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/04/french-lawmakers-debate-their-own-military-action-in-syria/ |title=France releases intelligence report alleging Syrian chemical weapons use, while Assad warns against strike |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report said analysis of samples collected from attacks in Saraqeb and Jobar in April 2013 had confirmed the use of [[sarin]].&lt;ref name=GuardianFrenchDossier/&gt;

''The Guardian'' reported that French intelligence had images that showed rocket attacks on opposition neighborhoods from government-controlled areas to the east and west of Damascus. The report said that the government later launched conventional bombing of those neighborhoods in order to destroy evidence of a chemical attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Patrick |last1=Wintour |first2=Kim |last2=Willsher |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/vladimir-putin-syria |title=Syria crisis: Vladimir Putin under growing pressure |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 September 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on analysis of 47 videos, the report said at least 281 fatalities occurred. Using other sources and extrapolation a chemical attack model estimated the total number of death at approximately 1,500.&lt;ref name=FrenchDossierEnglish /&gt;

===Germany===
The [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]] said it intercepted a phone call between a [[Hezbollah]] official and the Iranian Embassy in which the Hezbollah representative criticised Assad's decision to attack with poison gas, apparently confirming its use by the Syrian government.&lt;ref name="GermanIntercept"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fangt"/&gt; German newspaper ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported on 3 September that BND President Gerhard Schindler told them that based on the agency's evidence, Germany now shared the United Kingdom, United States, and France's view that the attacks were carried out by the Syrian government. However, they also said the attack may have been much more potent than intended, speculating that there may have been an error in mixing the chemical weapons used.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Gebauer, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 3 September 2013, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligence-contributes-to-fact-finding-on-syria-gas-attack-a-920123.html Gas Attack: Germany Offers Clue in Search for Truth in Syria]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Ian|title=German intelligence: Syria chemical attack may have been an overdose|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2013/sep/04/syria-assad-obama-germany|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
Without going into detail, Israeli Intelligence Minister [[Yuval Steinitz]] said on 22 August 2013 that Israel's intelligence assessment was that the Syrian government used [[chemical weapons]] in the [[Damascus]] area.&lt;ref name=IsraeliIntelligence&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/1.542975 |work=Haaretz |date=22 August 2013 |accessdate=7 May 2015 |title=Israeli intelligence backs reports of latest chemical weapons attack in Syria}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defense Minister [[Moshe Ya'alon]] said the [[government of Syria|Syrian government]] had already used chemical weapons against the rebels on a smaller scale multiple times prior to the Ghouta attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.542849|work=Haaretz|title=Defense Minister: Assad used chemical weapons multiple times in Syria|date=22 August 2013|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News]] reported that [[Unit 8200]] helped provide intelligence to the United States, Israel's closest international ally, implicating the Syrian government in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/28/israeli-intelligence-first-confirmed-assad-regime-behind-alleged-chemical/|title=Israeli intelligence first confirmed Assad regime behind alleged chemical attack|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=28 August 2013|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] said at the [[General debate of the sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly]] that Syrian government used the chemical weapons against its own people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gadebate.un.org/ |title=General Assembly OF THE UNITED NATIONS &amp;#124; General Debate of the 68th Session |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=13 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AwRz6aPF?url=http://gadebate.un.org/ |archivedate=25 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Russian officials said that there was no proof that the [[government of Syria]] had a hand in the chemical attacks. Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] described the American, British and French intelligence reports as "unconvincing"&lt;ref name="Oliphant"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10280017/US-intelligence-on-Syria-gas-attack-unconvincing-says-Russia.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=US intelligence on Syria gas attack 'unconvincing', says Russia|date=2 September 2013|accessdate=20 September 2013|location=London|first=Roland|last=Oliphant}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said at a joint news conference with his French counterpart [[Laurent Fabius]] after the release of the United Nations report in mid-September that he continued to believe the rebels carried out the attack.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"/&gt; Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] said he wanted to see evidence that would make it "obvious" who used chemical weapons in Ghouta.&lt;ref name=Levs&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Levs |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/world/syria-us-evidence-chemical-weapons-attack/index.html |title=What's the evidence of Syrian chemical weapons attack? |date=4 September 2013 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a commentary published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 11 September 2013, Putin wrote that "there is every reason to believe [poison gas] was used not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons,".&lt;ref name=Putin /&gt; Lavrov said on 18 September that "new evidence" given to Russia by the Syrian government would be forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/18/russia-syrian-rebels-chemical-weapons|work=The Guardian|title=Russia to provide evidence 'implicating Syrian rebels in chemical attacks'|date=18 September 2013|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
The [[government of Turkey|Turkish government]]-run [[Anadolu Agency]] published an unconfirmed report on 30 August 2013, pointing to the Syrian 155th Missile Brigade and the 4th Armored Division as the perpetrators of the two attacks. It said the attack had involved 15 to 20 missiles with chemical warheads at around 02:45 on 21 August, targeting residential areas between [[Douma, Syria|Douma]] and [[Zamalka]] in Eastern [[Ghouta]]. It claimed that the 155th Missile Brigade had used [[9K52 Luna-M]] missiles, [[Fateh-110|M600]] missiles, or both, fired from Kufeyte, while other rockets with a 15- to 70-kilometer range were fired by the 4th Armored Division from [[Mount Qasioun]]. The agency did not explain its source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |date=30 August 2013 |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-state-agency-obtains-detailed-information-about-chemical-attacks-in-syria-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=53556&amp;NewsCatID=352 |title=Turkey's state agency obtains detailed information about chemical attacks in Syria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
A report on the attacks by the United Kingdom's [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] (JIC) was published on 29 August 2013 prior to a vote on intervention by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]. The report said at least 350 people were killed and that it was "highly likely" that the attacks had been carried out by the Syrian government, resting in part on the firm view that the Syrian opposition was not capable of carrying out a chemical weapons attack on this scale, and on the JIC view that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war on a small scale on 14 previous occasions.&lt;ref name=UKintelligence /&gt; Analysis of the Ghouta attacks themselves was based largely on reviewing video footage and publicly available witness evidence. The report conceded problems with motivation for the attacks, saying there was "no obvious political or military trigger for regime use of CW on an apparently larger scale now."&lt;ref name=addsnothing&gt;{{cite news |work=The Guardian |date=29 August 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/uk-report-chemical-attack-syria |title=UK report on chemical attack in Syria adds nothing to informed speculation|first=Ian |last=Black |first2=Ian |last2=Sample |accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Independent |date=30 August 2013 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/beyond-reasonable-doubt-evidence-on-syrian-chemical-atrocity-fails-to-make-a-case-for-war-8790589.html |title=Beyond reasonable doubt?

{{main article|U.S. Government Assessment of the Syrian Government's Use of Chemical Weapons on August 21, 2013}}
[[File:Syria - Damascus Areas of Influence and Areas Reportedly Affected by 21 August Chemical Attack.jpg|thumb|320px|The map of "Areas of Influence" and "Areas Reportedly affected by the 21 August Chemical Attack" that was published by the White House on 30 August 2013.&lt;ref name="White House assessment"/&gt;]] A controversial "US government assessment of the Ghouta attacks" was published by the [[White House]] on 30 August 2013, with a longer classified version made available to members of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The report blamed the chemical attacks on the Syrian government, saying rockets containing a [[nerve agent]] were fired from government-held territory into neighborhoods in the early morning, impacting at least 12 locations. It stated 1,429 people were killed, including at least 426 children. It dismissed the possibility that evidence supporting the US government's conclusion could have been manufactured by the opposition, stating it "does not have the capability" to fabricate videos, eyewitness accounts, and other information. The report also said that the US believed Syrian officials directed the attacks, based on "intercepted communications."&lt;ref name="White House assessment"/&gt; A major element, as reported by news media, was an intercepted telephone call between a [[Syrian Ministry of Defense]] official and a Syrian 155th Brigade chemical weapons unit commander in which the former demanded answers for the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/08/27/exclusive_us_spies_say_intercepted_calls_prove_syrias_army_used_nerve_gas|work=Foreign Policy|title=Exclusive: Intercepted Calls Prove Syrian Army Used Nerve Gas, U.S. Spies Say|date=27 August 2013|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some reports, this phone intercept was provided to the U.S. by [[Israeli Intelligence Corps]] [[Unit 8200]].&lt;ref name="intercepted"/&gt;

The U.S. government assessment suggested a motive for the attack, describing it as "a desperate effort to push back rebels from several areas in the capital's densely packed eastern suburbs." The report then states that evidence suggests "the high civilian death toll surprised and panicked senior Syrian officials, who called off the attack and then tried to cover it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joby Warrick |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-1500-killed-in-syrian-chemical-weapons-attack-us-says/2013/08/30/b2864662-1196-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_story.html |title=More than 1,400 killed in Syrian chemical weapons attack, U.S. says |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 September 2013 |date=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] later announced that hair, blood, soil, and cloth samples collected from the attack sites had tested positive for [[sarin]] or its immediate breakdown products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ellison |last=Barber |date=1 September 2013 |url=http://freebeacon.com/culture/sunday-show-round-up-3/ |title=Sunday Show Round Up |work=Washington Free Beacon |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sample|first=Ian|title=Syrian chemical weapons: how lab tests uncover evidence of sarin gas|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/syrian-chemical-weapons-tests-sarin|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic Party Representative [[Alan Grayson]] offered some details regarding the classified report, which he described as 12 pages long, and criticized both the four-page public summary and the classified report. Grayson said the unclassified summary relied on "intercepted telephone calls, 'social media' postings and the like, but not one of these is actually quoted or attached … (As to whether the classified summary is the same, I couldn't possibly comment, but again, draw your own conclusion.)" Grayson cited as a problematic example the intercepted phone call between a Syrian Ministry of Defense official and the Syrian 155th Brigade, the transcript of which was not provided in the classified report, leaving Grayson unable to judge the accuracy of a report in [[The Daily Caller]] that the call's implications had been misrepresented in the report.&lt;ref name="usnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grayson /&gt;

The AP quoted anonymous US intelligence officials as saying that the evidence presented in the report linking Assad to the attack was "not a slam dunk."&lt;ref name=APnoslamdunk /&gt; [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] also reported that James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, personally told President Obama that the case for the Syrian government's responsibility was strong but not a "slam dunk."&lt;ref name=goldberg&gt;{{cite news |title=The Obama Doctrine |first=Jeffrey |last=Goldberg |work=Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/ |date=April 2016 |accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP later characterized the evidence released by the administration as circumstantial and said the government had denied its requests for more direct evidence, including satellite imagery and communications intercepts cited in the government assessment.&lt;ref name=APdoubts&gt;{{cite news |first=Zeina |last=Karam |first2=Kimberly |last2=Dozier |agency=Associated Press |work=The Times of Israel |date=8 September 2013 |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/doubts-linger-over-syria-gas-attack-evidence/ |title=Doubts linger over Syria gas attack evidence |accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inter Press Service|IPS]] news analyst [[Gareth Porter]] questioned why the report was released by the White House as a "government assessment" as opposed being released by the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] as an "intelligence community assessment." Porter quoted former intelligence officials who said the report was "evidently an administration document" and who also suggested evidence was "cherry-picked" to support the conclusion that the Syrian government carried out the attacks.&lt;ref name="ipsporter"&gt;{{cite web |first=Gareth |last=Porter |authorlink=Gareth Porter |date=9 September 2013 |work=Inter Press Service |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/09/obamas-case-for-syria-didnt-reflect-intel-consensus/ |title=/CORRECTED REPEAT/Obama's Case for Syria Didn't Reflect Intel Consensus |accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 2013, the then White House Chief-of-Staff, [[Denis McDonough]] said the administration lacks the "irrefutable, beyond-a-reasonable-doubt evidence", but that a "common-sense test" implicates Assad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/09/obama_aid_says_us_lacks_irrefu.html|title=Obama aide says U.S. lacks 'irrefutable' evidence Syria's Assad used chemical weapons| work=PennLive|agency=Associated Press|date=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. publicly stated there was no "reliable" evidence that the opposition had access to chemical weapons, although [[Seymour Hersh]] reported that U.S. intelligence agencies privately assessed some rebel factions to be capable of sarin production.&lt;ref name=WhoseSarinHersh /&gt;

==Legal status==

===Attack===
At the time of the attack, Syria was not a member of the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. However, [[Human Rights Watch]] argues that the Ghouta chemical attack was illegal under a different international agreement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Syria is a party to the [[Geneva Protocol|1925 Geneva Gas protocol]], which bans the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices. The use of chemical weapons is also prohibited as a matter of customary international humanitarian law, or the laws of war. The prohibition on the use of chemical weapons applies to all armed conflicts, including so-called non-international armed conflicts such as the current fighting in Syria. The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], in the Tadic case, stated "there undisputedly emerged a general consensus in the international community on the principle that the use of [chemical] weapons is also prohibited in internal armed conflicts."&lt;ref name="HrwPublication" /&gt;{{rp|page=21}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===International Criminal Court referral===
Human Rights Watch stated that the [[UN Security Council]] should refer the Syria situation to the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) "to ensure accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity."&lt;ref name="HRW_21Aug2013" /&gt; [[Amnesty International]] also said that the Syria situation should be referred to the ICC because "the best way for the United States to signal its abhorrence for war crimes and crimes against humanity and to promote justice in Syria, would be to reaffirm its support for the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court."&lt;ref name="AmnestyI_31Aug2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Military Strikes in Syria Cannot Bring Justice |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |date=31 August 2013 |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/military-strikes-in-syria-cannot-bring-justice |accessdate=31 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JIA1ro9v?url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/military-strikes-in-syria-cannot-bring-justice |archivedate=31 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the [[Amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|amendment to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] explicitly making it a war crime to use chemical weapons in an internal conflict has not been ratified by any major state nor Syria, the legal situation is complex and reliant on the attack being a part of a wider war crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejiltalk.org/can-the-icc-prosecute-for-use-of-chemical-weapons-in-syria/ |title=Can the ICC Prosecute for Use of Chemical Weapons in Syria? |author=Dapo Akande |publisher=European Journal of International Law |date=23 August 2013 |accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Irish Touring Car Championship''' is a [[touring car racing]] series held each year in Ireland. It was established in 2010.

== History ==
The Irish Touring Car Championship was formed in 2010 as a replacement for the Saloon Libre class which had been run by [[Mondello Park]]. The series was designed to bring together drivers from various backgrounds, such as other touring car series and time-attack and track day competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.kildare.ie/community/notices/sports/new_irish_touring_car_series_t.asp | title=New Irish Touring Car Series to Debut at Mondello | work=kildare.ie | date=30 March 2010 | accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- == Regulations ==--&gt;
== Race formats ==
The series consists of six events, each of which is made up of two rounds. Five events are held at [[Mondello Park]], using the International and National Circuits, and the other is staged at the Bishopscourt Racing Circuit in [[Northern Ireland]]. The series has previously held races at the [[Kirkistown Circuit]], also in Northern Ireland, and at the [[Anglesey Circuit]] in [[Wales]].

The '''Jakarta Art Building''' ('''''Gedung Kesenian Jakarta'''''), historically known as '''''Schouwburg Weltevreden''''', is a concert hall in [[Sawah Besar]], [[Central Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], built during the colonial period in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies]].

==History==
The idea for the creation of a theater in Batavia (the colonial name for Jakarta) came from the Governor-General of Batavia at that time, [[Herman Willem Daendels]]. This idea was realized by [[Stamford Raffles]], who was known for his passion for the study and preservation of local culture. In 1814 Raffles ordered the construction of a simple bamboo theatre near Waterlooplein (a square in Jakarta, now ''Lapangan Banteng''), under the name "Military Theater Venue".&lt;ref name="ency-schouwburg" /&gt; It was built by English soldiers and had a capacity of 250 people.&lt;ref name="ency-schouwburg" /&gt; This first theater in Batavia was used from 1811 to 1816 for the entertainment of British soldiers.

In August 1816, the English gave the Indies back to the [[Dutch East Indies]] and Batavia was under the governorship of the Netherlands once more. Performances were again held in the building on April 21, 1817, by groups of Dutch amateur performers.

In 1820 the bamboo theater began to show signs of deterioration, and in 1821, supported by the Dutch colonial government, it was replaced with a more permanent structure. The architect chosen to design the building was [[J.C. Schultze]] (who also designed the [[Harmony Society, Batavia]] building. The contractor was Lie Atjie, who took material from the ''spinhuis'' in the [[Jakarta Old Town|old town area]] to use for the new theater. Construction took 14 months. The new building was designed in [[Neoclassical style]] and was called ''Schouwburg Weltevreden'', also popularly known as ''Gedung Komedi'' ("Comedy building").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indotravelers.com/jakarta/tempat-wisata-sejarah-di-jakarta.html Tempat Wisata Sejarah di Jakarta]&lt;/ref&gt; Inauguration was planned for October 1821 but had to be postponed until December 7 because of a [[cholera]] epidemic. The first performance in the building was Shakespeare's [[Othello]].

During the mid 19th century, the development of ''Schouwburg Weltevreden'' was slow, and it had difficulty making a profit, because Batavia lacked European female opera singers and did not have a complete orchestra. The government took over the theater in 1848, when the private company failed, and held it until 1892. In 1911 its administration was assigned to the city of Batavia.

At first, lighting inside the building was done using candles and kerosene lamps. Gas light came in 1864. Electricity was first used inside the building in 1882, but gas light was still used outside until 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiarooms.com/en/travel-guide/indonesia/jakarta/entertainment-in-jakarta/music-clubs-&amp;-theaters-in-jakarta/the-gedung-kesenian-jakarta-in-jakarta.html Asiarooms - Gedung Kesenian Jakarta]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, during Indonesia's period of [[Indonesian National Awakening|National Awakening]], the building was used by the local Youth Alliance for the first ''Kongres Pemoeda'' (Youth Congress).&lt;ref name="trully"&gt;[http://trully.multiply.com/photos/album/35/Di_Sekitar_Gedung_Kesenian_Jakarta Di Sekitar Gedung Kesenian Jakarta]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] from 1942 to 1945, the building was used temporarily as a military headquarters. In April 1943 it was used as a theater under the name ''Sin'tsu Cekizyoo''.&lt;ref name="ency-schouwburg" /&gt;

During the independence era the building was used as a meeting place for a group of youth artists known as ''Seniman Merdeka'', ("Independent Artists"), among whom were [[Rosihan Anwar]], [[Usmar Ismail]], El Hakim, and [[HB Jassin]]. On August 29, 1945, twelve days after the official [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declaration of independence of Indonesia]], the first president of Indonesia, [[Sukarno]], inaugurated the [[Central Indonesian National Committee]],  which had its first meeting in the building.&lt;ref name="trully" /&gt;

In 1951 the building was used by the Faculty of Economy and Law of [[University of Indonesia|Indonesia University]]. And from 1957 to 1961, the building was used by the Indonesian National Theater Academy.&lt;ref name="ency-schouwburg" /&gt;

The building was again changed its name to ''Bioskop Diana'' (Diana Theater) in 1968 and a year later an institution for the building was established under the leadership of Brigadier General Pimgadie. In 1970, the institution transformed the building into a cinema showing Chinese movies. It was known during this period as the City Theater.&lt;ref name="ency-schouwburg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tempo"&gt;{{cite journal |author= |year=1973 |title= |journal=Tempo |volume=3 |issue= |page=196 |publisher=Badan Usaha Jaya Press Jajasan Jaya Raya |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=bDtfTq6oCMnOrQeZ6sS9Dw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=vLsTAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22city+theater%22+gedung+kesenian+jakarta&amp;q=%22city+theater%22 |accessdate=September 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 a Law&lt;ref&gt;SK Gubernur KDKI Jakarta tahun 1984&lt;/ref&gt; was enacted to return the building to its original function. It was renovated at a cost of 3 billion [[rupiah]]. On September 5, 1987, it was renamed the ''Gedung Kesenian Jakarta'', replacing the former name ''Gedung Kesenian Pasar Baru''.&lt;ref name="ency-schouwburg" /&gt;

==Facility==
The building features two open halls (one on each side), the {{convert|24|x|17.5|m|ft}} main concert room with a balcony (capacity: 475 people), a stage measuring {{convert |10.75|x|14|x|17|m|ft}}, and a "loge", which is basically an empty place to the right and left of the spectators, where five seats could be installed if required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4328">In [[science]] and [[philosophy]], a '''just-so story''' is an unverifiable narrative explanation for a [[culture|cultural]] practice, a biological trait, or behavior of humans or other animals. The [[pejorative]]&lt;ref name="Buller2005"/&gt; nature of the expression is an implicit criticism that reminds the hearer of the essentially fictional and unprovable nature of such an explanation.  Such tales are common in [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] (where they are known as ''etiological myths''&amp;mdash;see [[etiology#Historical|etiology]]).

This phrase is a reference to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s 1902 ''[[Just So Stories]]'', containing fictional and deliberately fanciful tales for children, in which the stories pretend to explain [[animal]] characteristics, such as the origin of the spots on the leopard.&lt;ref name="Love2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Glen A. Love|title=Practical Ecocriticism: Literature, Biology, and the Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ5mbMlzS5cC&amp;pg=PA71|year=2003|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=978-0-8139-2245-4|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kipling1902"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sff.net/people/karawynn/justso/leopard.htp|accessdate=2013-04-13|author=Rudyard Kipling|chapter=How the Leopard got his Spots|title=Just So Stories for Little Children|year=1902|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414175602/http://www.sff.net/people/karawynn/justso/leopard.htp|archivedate=2013-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phrase has been used to criticize evolutionary explanations of traits that have been proposed to be [[adaptation]]s, particularly in the [[Creation–evolution controversy|evolution–creation debates]]&lt;ref name="Isaak2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Isaak|title=The Counter-Creationism Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dGFJXLEWogEC&amp;pg=PA102|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24926-4|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in debates regarding research methods in [[sociobiology]]&lt;ref name="Love2003"/&gt; and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name="Buller2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Buller|title=[[Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature]]|year=2005|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-02579-9|pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Academics such as [[David Barash]] say that the term ''just-so story'', when applied to a proposed evolutionary adaptation, is simply a derogatory term for a ''[[hypothesis]]''. Hypotheses, by definition, require further empirical assessment, and are a part of normal science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=David Barash |url=https://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2012/09/17/an-unevolved-take-on-psychology-from-the-new-yorker/ |accessdate=2013-04-13|title=An Unevolved Take on Psychology|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[Robert Kurzban]] suggested that "The goal should not be to expel stories from science, but rather to identify the stories that are also good explanations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Robert Kurzban|year=2012|url=http://www.epjournal.net/blog/2012/09/just-so-stories-are-bad-explanations-functions-are-much-better-explanations/ |accessdate=2013-04-13|title=Just So Stories Are (Bad) Explanations. Functions Are Much Better Explanations|publisher=Evolutionary Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Triumph of Sociobiology'', [[John Alcock (behavioral ecologist)|John Alcock]] suggested that the term ''just-so story'' as applied to proposed evolved adaptations is "one of the most successful derogatory labels ever invented".&lt;ref name="Alcock2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Alcock|title=The Triumph of Sociobiology|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Triumph-Sociobiology-John-Alcock/dp/0195163354|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195143836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been 110 papal elections that have produced [[List of popes|popes currently recognized]] by the [[Catholic Church]] as legitimate. There was no fixed process for [[papal selection before 1059|papal succession before 1059]] and [[pope]]s were often selected with substantial secular involvement, if not [[papal appointment|outright appointment]]. Since the promulgation of ''[[In nomine Domini]]'' (1059), however, suffrage has been limited to the [[College of Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Baptist Sägmüller, "[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Cardinal (1)|Cardinal]]" in ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1913).&lt;/ref&gt;

Papal elections since 1276 have taken the form of [[papal conclave]]s, which are elections that follow a set of rules and procedures developed in ''[[Ubi periculum]]'' (1274) and later [[papal bull]]s; observance of the conclave varied until 1294, but all papal elections since have followed relatively similar conclave procedures.

Although the [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] have historically gathered at a handful of other locations within Rome and beyond, only five elections since 1455 have been held outside the [[Apostolic Palace]].&lt;ref name="baumsix"/&gt; Twenty-eight papal elections have been held outside Rome, in: [[Terracina]] (1088), [[Cluny]] (1119), [[Velletri]] (1181), [[Verona]] (1185), [[Ferrara]] (October 1187), [[Pisa]] (December 1187), [[Perugia Papacy|Perugia]] (1216, 1264&amp;ndash;1265, 1285, 1292&amp;ndash;1294, 1304&amp;ndash;1305), [[Anagni]] (1243), [[Naples]] (1254, 1294), [[Viterbo Papacy|Viterbo]] (1261, 1268&amp;ndash;1271, July 1276, August–September 1276, 1277, 1281&amp;ndash;1282), [[Arezzo]] (January 1276), [[Carpentras]]/[[Lyon]] (1314&amp;ndash;1316), [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] (1334, 1342, 1352, 1362, 1370), [[Konstanz]] (1417) and [[Venice]] (1799&amp;ndash;1800). Three elections moved between locations while in progress: the elections of [[Papal election, 1268–71|1268–71]], [[Papal election, 1292–94|1292–94]], and [[Papal conclave, 1314–16|1314–16]].

==Wars against Livs and Latgalians (1198–1209)==
[[File:Talava.tif|thumbnail|left|Lands of Tālava]]
[[File:Lotigola.jpg|thumbnail|left|Lands of Lotigola]]

Christianity had come to [[Latvia]] with the settlement of [[Grobiņa]] by [[Swedes]] in the 7th century and the [[Danes]] in the 11th. By the time [[Germans|German]] traders began to arrive in the second half of the 12th century to trade along the ancient [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], some natives had already been baptized.

Saint [[Meinhard of Segeberg]] arrived in [[Ikšķile]] in 1184 with the mission of converting the pagan [[Livonians]], and was consecrated as [[Bishop of Üxküll]] in 1186. In those days the riverside town was the center of the upcoming missionary activities in the Livonian area.
 
The indigenous [[Livonians]] (''Līvi''), who had been paying tribute to the [[East Slavic peoples|East Slavic]] [[Principality of Polotsk]],&lt;ref&gt;Blomkvist Nils, The Discovery of the Baltic : The Reception of a Catholic World-system in the European North (AD 1075-1225) (Leiden 2005)p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; and were often under attack by their southern neighbours the [[Semigallians]], at first considered the Low Germans ([[Saxons]]) to be useful allies. The first prominent Livonian to be converted was their leader [[Caupo of Turaida]], who was baptized around 1189.

[[Pope Celestine III]] had called for a crusade against [[paganism|pagans]] in [[Northern Europe]] in 1193. When peaceful means of conversion failed to produce results, the impatient Meinhard plotted to convert Livonians forcibly, but was thwarted. He died in 1196, having failed in his mission. His appointed replacement, bishop [[Berthold of Hanover]], a [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] [[abbot of Loccum]] arrived with a large contingent of crusaders in 1198. Shortly afterward, while riding ahead of his troops in battle, Berthold was surrounded and killed, and his forces defeated by Livonians.

To avenge Berthold's defeat, [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a bull declaring a crusade against the Livonians. [[Albert of Riga|Albrecht von Buxthoeven]], consecrated as bishop in 1199, arrived the following year with a large force, and established [[Riga]] as the seat of his [[Bishopric of Riga]] in 1201. In 1202 he formed the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] to aid in the conversion of the pagans to Christianity and, more importantly, to protect German trade and secure German control over commerce.

As the German grip tightened, the Livonians and their christened chief rebelled against the crusaders. Caupo's forces were defeated at Turaida in 1206, and the Livonians were declared to be converted. Caupo subsequently remained an ally of the crusaders until his death in the [[Battle of St. Matthew's Day]] in 1217.

By 1208 the important Daugava trading posts of [[Salaspils]] (Holme), [[Koknese]] (Kokenhusen) and [[Sēlpils Castle]] (Selburg) had been taken over as a result of Albert's energetic campaigning. In the same year, the rulers of the [[Latgalians|Latgalian]] counties [[Tālava]], [[Satekle]], and [[Autine]] established military alliances with the Order, and construction began on both [[Cēsis Castle]] and a stone [[Koknese Castle]], where the [[Daugava River|Daugava]] and [[Pērse]] rivers meet, replacing the wooden castle of Latgalians.

In 1209 Albert, leading the forces of the Order, captured the capital of the Latgalian [[Principality of Jersika]], and took the wife of the ruler [[Visvaldis]] captive. Visvaldis was forced to submit his kingdom to Albert as a grant to the [[Archbishopric of Riga]], and received back a portion of it as a fief. Tālava, weakened in wars with Estonians and Russians, became a [[vassal state]] of the Archbishopric of Riga in 1214, and in 1224 was finally divided between the Archbishopric and the Order.

==Wars against Estonians (1208–27)==
[[File:Ancient Estonian counties.png|thumb|left|Counties of [[Ancient Estonia]]]]
[[File:Danmarks flag 1219 Lorentzen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] falling from the sky during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]], 1219.]]
By 1208 the Crusaders were strong enough to begin operations against the [[Estonians]], who were at that time divided into eight major and seven smaller [[List of rulers of Estonia#Ancient Counties and Parishes|Counties]], led by elders, with limited co-operation between them. With the help of the newly converted local tribes of Livs and [[Latgalians]], the crusaders initiated raids into [[Sakala County|Sakala]] and [[Ugandi County|Ugaunia]] in Southern Estonia. The Estonian tribes fiercely resisted the attacks from Riga and occasionally sacked territories controlled by the crusaders.

In 1208–27, war parties of the different sides rampaged through [[Livonia]], Latgalia, and other Estonian counties, with the Livs, Latgalians and [[Russians]] of the [[Republic of Novgorod]] serving variously as allies of both crusaders and Estonians. [[Hill fort]]s, which were the key centers of Estonian counties, were besieged, captured, and re-captured a number of times. A truce between the war-weary sides was established for three years (1213–1215). It proved generally more favourable to the Germans, who consolidated their political position, while the Estonians were unable to develop their system of loose alliances into a centralised state. They were led by [[Lembitu of Lehola]], the elder of [[Sackalia]], who by 1211 had come to the attention of German chroniclers as the central figure of the Estonian resistance. The Livonian leader Caupo was killed in the [[Battle of St. Matthew's Day]] near [[Viljandi|Viljandi (Fellin)]] on September 21, 1217, but Lembitu was also killed, and the battle was a crushing defeat for the Estonians.

The Christian kingdoms of [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] were also eager for expansion on the eastern shores of the Baltic. In 1218 Albert asked King [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] for assistance, but Valdemar instead arranged a deal with the Order. The king was victorious in the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]] in [[Revelia]] in 1219, to which the origin of the [[Flag of Denmark]] is attributed. He subsequently founded the fortress [[Castrum Danorum]], which was unsuccessfully besieged by the Estonians in 1220 and 1223. King [[John I of Sweden]] tried to establish a Swedish presence in the province of [[Lääne County|Wiek]], but his troops were defeated by the [[Oeselians]] in the [[Battle of Lihula]] in 1220. Revelia, [[Harrien]], and [[Vironia]], the whole of northern Estonia, fell to Danish control.

During the uprising of 1223, all Christian strongholds in Estonia save [[Tallinn]] fell into Estonian hands, with their defenders killed. By 1224 all of the larger fortresses were reconquered by the crusaders, except for [[Tartu|Tharbata]], which was defended by a determined Estonian garrison and 200 Russian mercenaries. The leader of the Russian troops was [[Vyachko]], to whom the [[Novgorod Republic]] had promised the fortress and its surrounding lands "if he could conquer them for himself".&lt;ref&gt;Tarvel, Enn (ed.). 1982. ''Henriku Liivimaa kroonika. Heinrici Chronicon Livoniae.'' p. 246. Tallinn: Eesti Raamat.&lt;/ref&gt; Tharbata was finally captured by the crusaders in August 1224 and all its defenders killed.

Early in 1224 Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] had announced at [[Catania]] that Livonia, [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], [[Sambia]] and a number of neighboring provinces would henceforth be considered ''[[Reichsfreiheit|reichsfrei]]'', that is, subordinate directly to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] only, as opposed to being under the jurisdiction of local rulers. At the end of the year [[Pope Honorius III]] announced the appointment of Bishop [[William of Modena]] as [[papal legate]] for Livonia, Prussia, and other countries.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
In 1224 the Livonian Brothers of the Sword established their headquarters at [[Viljandi|Fellin (Viljandi)]] in Sackalia, where the walls of the Master's castle are still standing. Other strongholds included [[Cēsis Castle|Wenden (Cēsis)]], [[Sigulda Medieval Castle|Segewold (Sigulda)]], and [[Aizkraukle Castle|Ascheraden (Aizkraukle)]].

The [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]], one of the greatest medieval narratives, was written probably as a report for William of Modena, giving him the history of the Church in Livonia up to his time. It relates how in 1226, in the stronghold [[Tarwanpe]], William of Modena successfully mediated a peace between the Germans, the Danes and the [[Vironians]].

===War against Saaremaa (1206–61)===
{{Main article|Oeselians}}
[[File:OeselLivTrty1241.jpg|thumb|right|The 1241 Treaty between [[Livonian Order]], [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]] and [[Oeselians]] at [[National Archives of Sweden]]]]
The last Estonian county to hold out against the invaders was the island country of [[Saaremaa|Saaremaa (Ösel)]], whose war fleets had continued to raid Denmark and Sweden during the years of fighting against the German crusaders.

In 1206, a Danish army led by king [[Valdemar II]] and [[Anders Sunesen|Andreas, the Bishop of Lund]], landed on Saaremaa and attempted to establish a stronghold, without success. In 1216 the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] and the bishop Theodorich joined forces and invaded Saaremaa over the frozen sea. The Oeselians retaliated by raiding German-held territories in Latvia the following spring. In 1220 a Swedish army led by king [[John I of Sweden]] and the bishop [[Karl Magnusson (Bjälboätten)|Karl of Linköping]] captured [[Lihula]] in [[Rotalia]] in Western Estonia. The Oeselians attacked the Swedish stronghold later the same year and killed the entire garrison, including the Bishop of Linköping.

In 1222, the Danish king [[Valdemar II]] attempted a second conquest of Saaremaa, this time establishing a stone fortress housing a strong garrison. The  stronghold was besieged and surrendered within five days, the Danish garrison returning to [[Reval|Revel]] while leaving Bishop [[Albert of Riga]]'s brother Theodoric and others behind as hostages for peace. The castle was leveled by the Oeselians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GNBNHgAACAAJ&amp;dq The Baltic Crusade By William L. Urban; p 113–114] {{ISBN|0-929700-10-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1227, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, the town of [[Riga]], and the [[Bishop of Riga]] organized a combined attack against Saaremaa. After the surrender of two major Oeselian strongholds, [[Muhu]] and [[Valjala]], the Oeselians formally accepted Christianity.

After the defeat of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in the [[Battle of Saule]] in 1236 fighting again broke out on Saaremaa. In 1241 the Oeselians once again accepted [[Christianity]] by signing treaties with the [[Livonian Order]]'s Master Andreas de Velven and the [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]]. This was followed by a treaty signed in 1255 by the Master of the Order, Anno Sangerhausenn, and, on behalf of the Oeselians, elders whose names were phonetically transcribed by Latin scribes as Ylle, Culle, Enu, Muntelene, Tappete, Yalde, Melete, and Cake &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=5T5NR8i7Gp_QpwLvvNn3Bg&amp;id=aTouAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ylle+culle+muntelene&amp;q=Ylle+Culle&amp;pgis=1#search|title=Liv-, est- und kurländisches Urkundenbuch: Bd. 1. 1093-1300.

Warfare erupted in 1261 as the Oeselians once more renounced Christianity and killed all the Germans on the island. A peace treaty was signed after the united forces of the [[Livonian Order]], the [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]], and [[Danish Estonia]], including  mainland Estonians and Latvians, defeated the Oeselians by capturing their stronghold at Kaarma. Soon thereafter, the [[Livonian Order]] established a stone fort at [[Pöide Parish|Pöide]].

On July 24, 1343, the Oeselians arose yet again, killing all the Germans on the island, drowning all the clerics, and besieging the [[Livonian Order]]'s castle at Pöide. After the garrison surrendered the Oeselians massacred the defenders and destroyed the castle. In February 1344 [[Burchard von Dreileben]] led a campaign over the frozen sea to Saaremaa. The Oeselians' stronghold was conquered and their leader Vesse was hanged. In the early spring of 1345, the next campaign of the [[Livonian Order]] ended with a treaty mentioned in the Chronicle of [[Hermann von Wartberge]] and the [[Novgorod First Chronicle]].

Saaremaa remained the vassal of the master of the [[Livonian Order]] and the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek until 1559.

==Wars against Curonians (1242–67)==
[[File:OldCourland.jpg|thumbnail|right|Couronian lands]]
Following the defeat of the Estonians, the crusade moved against [[Curonians]] and [[Semigallians]], [[Balts|Baltic]] tribes living to the south and west of the [[Daugava River|Daugava]] river and closely allied with [[Samogitians]].

In July 1210 [[Curonians]] attacked [[Riga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/1500/entity_4029.html|title=Euratlas Periodis Web - Map of Livonia in Year 1500|first=|last=Euratlas|date=|website=www.euratlas.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a day of fighting, the Curonians were unable to break through the city walls. They crossed to the other bank of the Daugava to burn their dead and mourn for three days.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle of Henry of Livonia&lt;/ref&gt; In 1228 Curonians together with [[Semigallians]] again attacked Riga. Although they were again unsuccessful in storming the city, they destroyed a monastery in [[Daugavgriva]] and killed all the monks.

After the defeat of Estonians and Osilians in 1227, the Curonians were confronted by Lithuanian enemies in the east and south, and harassed by the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] from the north; in the west, on the sea-shore, their arch-enemies, the Danes and Swedes, were lurking, waiting for opportunity. In this hopeless situation, further aggravated by a famine, the Curonians preferred to try to make peace with the Christian conquerors, inviting the monks into their country thereby escaping attacks by the Scandinavian nations.&lt;ref name=Saks244&gt;[[Edgar V. Saks]]. ''Aestii''. 1960. p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1230 the Curonians in the northern part of Courland, under their chief [[Lamekins]] (''Lammechinus Rex''), signed a peace treaty with the Germans, and the lands they inhabited thus became to be known as ''Vredecuronia'' or ''Peace Courland''. The southern Curonians, however, continued to resist the invaders.

In 1260, the Curonians were involved in the [[Battle of Durbe]], one of the biggest battles in Livonia in the 13th century. They were forced to fight on the crusader side. When the battle started, Curonians abandoned the knights. [[Peter von Dusburg]] alleged that the Curonians even attacked the Knights from the rear. The [[Estonians]] and other local people soon followed the Curonians and abandoned the Knights and that allowed the [[Samogitians]] to gain victory over the [[Livonian Order]]. It was a heavy defeat for the Order and uprisings against the crusaders soon afterwards broke out in the Curonian and [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] lands.

Curonian resistance was finally subdued in 1266, when the whole of Courland was partitioned between the Livonian Order and the [[Archbishopric of Riga|Archbishop of Riga]]. The Curonian nobles, among them 40 clans of the descendants of the [[Curonian Kings|Curonian kings]], who lived in the town of [[Kuldīga]], preserved personal freedom and some of their privileges.&lt;ref name=Saks244/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Balodis. ''Lettland och letterna: Ha de rätt at leva''. Stockholm 1943. p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wars against Semigallians (1219–90)==
[[File:2010 09 04 7Tervete37.JPG|thumbnail|right|Tērvete hillfort, main Semigallian centre in 13th century]]
According to the ''[[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia|Livonian Chronicle of Henry]]'', Semigallians formed an alliance with bishop [[Albert of Riga]] against rebellious [[Livonians]] before 1203, and received military support to hold back [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] attacks in 1205. In 1207, the Semigallian duke [[Viestards]] ({{lang-la|dux Semigallorum}}) helped the christened Livonian chief [[Caupo of Turaida|Caupo]] conquer back his [[Turaida Castle|Turaida castle]] from pagan rebels.

In 1219, the Semigallian–German alliance was cancelled after a crusader invasion in Semigallia. Duke Viestards promptly formed an alliance with Lithuanians and Curonians. In 1228, Semigallians and [[Curonians]] attacked the [[Daugavgrīva]] monastery, the main crusader stronghold at the Daugava river delta. The crusaders took revenge and invaded Semigallia. The Semigallians in turn pillaged land around the [[Aizkraukle]] hillfort.

In 1236, Semigallians attacked crusaders retreating to Riga after the [[Battle of Saule]], killing many of them. 
After regular attacks, the [[Livonian Order]] partly subdued the Semigallians in 1254.

In 1270, the Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Traidenis]], together with Semigallians, attacked Livonia and [[Saaremaa]]. During the [[Battle of Karuse]] on the frozen [[Gulf of Riga]], the Livonian Order was defeated, and its master [[Otto von Lutterberg]] killed.

In 1287, around 1400 Semigallians attacked a crusader stronghold in [[Ikšķile]] and plundered nearby lands. As they returned to Semigallia they were caught by the Order's forces, and the great [[Battle of Garoza]] began near the Garoza river. The crusader forces were besieged and badly defeated. More than 40 knights were killed, including the master of the Livonian Order [[Willekin von Endorp]], and an unknown number of crusader allies. It was the last Semigallian victory over the growing forces of the Livonian Order.

In 1279, after the [[Battle of Aizkraukle]], Grand Duke Traidenis of Lithuania supported a Semigallian revolt against the Livonian Order led by duke [[Nameisis]].

In the 1280s, the Livonian Order started a massive campaign against the Semigallians, which included burning their fields and thus causing famine. Semigallians continued their resistance until 1290, when they burned their last castle in {{ill|Sidrabene (castle)|lt=Sidrabene|lt|Sidabrė|lv|Sidrabene (pils)}} and moved southwards. The ''[[Rhymed Chronicle]]'' claims that 100,000 migrated to Lithuania and once there continued to fight against the Germans.

The unconquered southern parts of Curonian and Semigallian territories ([[Sidrabe]], [[Rakte]], [[Ceklis]], [[Megava]] etc.) were united under the rule of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

==Aftermath==
[[File:Medieval Livonia 1260.svg|right|thumb|Terra Mariana in 1260.]]
[[File:Teutonic Order 1410.png|thumbnail|right|Territories controlled by the Teutonic Order in 1410]]
In 1227 the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] conquered all Danish territories in Northern Estonia. After the [[Battle of Saule]] the surviving members of the Brothers of the Sword merged into the [[Teutonic Order]] of Prussia in 1237 and became known as [[Livonian Order]]. On 7 June 1238, by the Treaty of Stensby, the Teutonic knights returned the Duchy of Estonia to Valdemar II, until in 1346, after [[St. George's Night Uprising]], the lands were sold back to the order and became part of the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Ordenstaat]].

After the conquest, all of the remaining local population were ostensibly [[Christianity|Christianized]]. In 1535, the first extant native language book was printed, a Lutheran catechism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://estonia.eu/about-estonia/culture-a-science/estonian-language.html Estonian Language] from Estonia.eu, retrieved 12 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The conquerors upheld military control through their network of castles throughout [[List of castles in Estonia|Estonia]] and [[List of castles in Latvia|Latvia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harrison|first= Dick|authorlink= |title= Gud vill det! - Nordiska korsfarare under medeltid|url= |accessdate= |year= 2005|publisher= Ordfront|location= |language= Swedish|isbn= 978-91-7441-373-1|page= |pages=573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land was divided into six feudal principalities by [[Papal Legate]] [[William of Modena]]: [[Archbishopric of Riga]], [[Bishopric of Courland]], [[Bishopric of Dorpat]], [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]], the lands ruled by the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] and [[Dominum directum]] of [[King of Denmark]], the [[Danish Estonia#Duchy of Estonia|Duchy of Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Northern Crusades |last=Christiansen |first=Eric |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0-14-026653-4 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W02ZZFqP1JcC&amp;q }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Scandinavia: Prehistory to 1520 |last=Knut |first=Helle |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0-521-47299-7 |page=269 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFBtfXG6fXAC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;vq=Duchy+of+Estonia&amp;dq=%22Duchy+of+Estonia%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lord Gordon-Gordon''' ({{circa}} 1840 &amp;ndash; August 1, 1874), also known as '''Lord Gordon Gordon''', '''Lord Glencairn''', and '''The Hon. Mr. Herbert Hamilton''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[fraud]] and [[impostor]], responsible for one of the greatest swindles in the 19th century [[United States]]. He swindled $1 million from [[Jay Gould]], who was fighting for control of the [[Erie Railroad]], and then fled to [[Canada]]. A failed [[kidnapping]] attempt by Gould and associates ended in their arrest and almost caused a military confrontation between the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="Brewer's"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=William|authorlink=William Donaldson|title=[[Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics]]|publisher=Phoenix|date=2004-09-02|location=London|pages=299–300|isbn=0-7538-1791-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in Britain ==
Little is known about the early life of Lord Gordon-Gordon. His real name is unknown, and it was rumoured that he was the illegitimate son of a [[Northern England|North Country]] clergyman and his family maid.

The first major incident involving Gordon-Gordon was in 1868 when, under the name of "Lord Glencairn", he swindled [[London]] jewellers [[Marshall &amp; Son]] for £25,000.&lt;ref name="Brewer's"/&gt; In March 1870, he left Britain and travelled to the United States.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web |last=Bovey |first=John A. |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5004&amp;&amp;PHPSESSID=l11gmebv67aklq1ji60gl8d3l4 |title=Gordon, Lord Gordon |publisher=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/gordongordon.shtml |title="Lord" Gordon Gordon, aka Hon. Mr. Herbert Hamilton and numerous other aliases (c&amp;nbsp;1840&amp;ndash;1874) |publisher=The Manitoba Historical Society |accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career in North America ==
Glencairn took the name "Lord Gordon-Gordon" as his alias, claiming to be a cousin of the [[Clan Campbell|Campbells]], a descendant of [[Lochinvar]] and of the ancient kings of the [[Scottish Highlands]]. He arrived in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and became involved with the [[Northern Pacific Railway]]. He told them that he was in America so that he could buy large tracts of land, upon which he could settle tenants from his overpopulated estates in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Brewer's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMHS"&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=J. L. |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/transactions/3/lordgordongordon.shtml |title=Lord Gordon Gordon |publisher=The Manitoba Historical Society |accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon-Gordon's next major incident came three months later when he moved to [[New York City]], claiming he was going to transfer his funds from Scotland in order to finance his purchase. With him, he carried a letter of introduction from Gould, who was then trying to gain control of the Erie Railroad in the [[Erie War]]. Gordon-Gordon told Gould that, with the help of several Europeans who had stock in the company, he could help Gould gain control of the railroad. Gould agreed to help him, on the condition that he gave Gordon-Gordon $1 million in negotiable stock in what he called "a pooling of interests": i.e. a bribe. However, as soon as Gordon-Gordon had taken the stock he put it on the market, swindling Gould.&lt;ref name="Brewer's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMHS"/&gt;

Gould sued Gordon-Gordon, and Gordon-Gordon was put on trial in March 1873. In court, Gordon-Gordon gave the names of the European personages he claimed to represent, and was granted bail while the references were checked. Gordon-Gordon took this opportunity to flee to Canada, where he convinced authorities that the allegations brought against him were false. Gordon-Gordon then offered to buy large parts of [[Manitoba]], an investment which would bring prosperity to Canada.&lt;ref name="Brewer's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMHS"/&gt;

After failing to convince or force Canadian authorities to hand over Gordon-Gordon, Gould and his associates, who included two future [[Governor of Minnesota|Governors of Minnesota]]{{who|date=August 2014}} and three future [[members of Congress]] ([[Loren Fletcher]], [[John Gilfillan]], and [[Eugene McLanahan Wilson]]), attempted to kidnap him. The group was successful, but were stopped and arrested by the [[North-West Mounted Police]] before they could return to the United States. The kidnappers were put in prison and refused bail.&lt;ref name="Brewer's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMHS"/&gt; This led to an international incident between the United States and Canada. Upon learning that the kidnappers were not given bail, Governor [[Horace Austin]] of Minnesota demanded their return and put the local militia on a state of full readiness. Thousands of Minnesotans volunteered for a full military invasion of Canada. However, after negotiations, the Canadian authorities released the kidnappers on bail.&lt;ref name="Brewer's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMHS"/&gt;

Gordon-Gordon believed himself safe, as at that time [[grand larceny]] and [[embezzlement]] were not crimes serious enough to warrant [[extradition]]. However, the news surrounding Gordon-Gordon reached Europe. The firm Marshall &amp; Son, the jewellers Gordon-Gordon had robbed some years ago, sent a representative to Canada who identified Gordon-Gordon as Lord Glencairn. Gordon-Gordon claimed that it was a smear campaign created by Gould and his associates, but the Canadian authorities considered the charges serious enough to sentence him to [[deportation]]. Before his deportation, Gordon-Gordon held a farewell party in his hotel room, where he gave expensive presents to his guests. After the party, he committed suicide by shooting himself on August 1, 1874.&lt;ref name="Brewer's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMHS"/&gt;

'''Maurizio Cocciolone''' (born 22 September 1960 in [[L'Aquila]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Italy]]) is an [[Aeronautica Militare|Italian Air Force]] officer, who served with [[United Nations|UN Coalition]] forces and was a [[prisoner of war]] during the [[Gulf War]].

He was born in [[L'Aquila]], [[Abruzzo]]. On the eve of the [[Operation Desert Storm]] the Italian government deployed eight [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]] [[Ground-attack aircraft|Fighter-bombers]] on the [[Persian Gulf|Gulf]] [[Theater (warfare)|Theatre of Operations]].

On January 16, 1991, coalition forces began concentrated [[air strike]]s on [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Iraqi military]] targets in [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]].

On January 18, 1991 an Italian [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]], piloted by Major [[Gianmarco Bellini]], with Captain Maurizio Cocciolone as his [[flight officer|navigator]], took off as part of a multi national 10 planes squadron. Bellini and Cocciolone were the only members of the squadron able to execute [[in-flight refueling]], while the other 9 aircraft failed and had to abort. The mission profile dictated that the operation could be performed even by a single plane, so Bellini and Cocciolone went on.

Their plane was hit by Iraqi [[anti aircraft]] fire and they had to eject. They were captured by [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Iraqi ground troops]], even though their status was unknown at the time.

On January 20, 1991 Cocciolone was shown on Iraqi [[television]] as part of a [[propaganda]] effort by his Iraqi captors. First the voice interviews, followed by the videotapes, were released by [[Cable News Network|CNN]]. Cocciolone appeared to be speaking under extreme duress, and his face showed signs of physical abuse. No news of Bellini was given initially, and he was feared to be a casualty. The two were kept separate for the whole time of their captivity.

Released by Iraq on March 3, 1991, Bellini and Cocciolone were the only Italian [[Prisoner of war|POW's]] captured during the entire war.

{{Economic anthropology}}
A '''moral economy''' is an economy that is based on goodness, fairness, and justice, as opposed to one where the market is assumed to be independent of such concerns. A moral economy is generally only possible in small, closely knit communities, where the principles of [[mutual aid (organization)|mutuality]]—i.e. "I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine"—operate to avoid the [[free rider problem]]. Where economic transactions arise between strangers who cannot be sanctioned by a social network, the free rider problem lacks a solution and a moral economy becomes harder to maintain. The concept was an elaboration by English historian [[E.P. Thompson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;, from a term already used by various eighteenth century authors, who felt that economic and moral concerns increasingly seemed to drift apart (see Götz 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Götz | first1 = Norbert | year = 2015 | title = 'Moral economy': its conceptual history and analytical prospects | journal = Journal of Global Ethics | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 147–162 | doi=10.1080/17449626.2015.1054556}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Thompson wrote of the moral economy of the poor in the context of widespread food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to "set the price" of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional "fair price" was more important to the community than a "free" market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. In the 1970s the concept of a moral economy was developed further in anthropological studies of peasant economies. The notion of a non-capitalist cultural mentality using the market for its own ends has been linked by others (with Thompson's approval) to [[subsistence agriculture]] and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cambodiaricefarming1.jpg|thumbnail|Cambodian rice farming]]

==Concept==
The concept was widely popularized in [[anthropology]] through the book ''[[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and subsistence in Southeast Asia]]'' by [[James C. Scott]] (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=James C.|title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and subsistence in Southeast Asia|year=1976|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins with a telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live so close to the subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a "safety first" principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as "traditionalist" when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides "subsistence insurance" for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes.

==A just economy==
{{main article|Just price}}
A '''moral economy''', in one interpretation, is an economy that is based on goodness, fairness, and justice.  Such an economy is generally only stable in small, closely knit communities, where the principles of [[mutual aid (organization)|mutuality]]—i.e. "I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine"—operate to avoid the [[free rider problem]].  Where economic transactions arise between strangers who cannot be informally sanctioned by a social network, the free rider problem lacks a solution and a moral economy becomes harder to maintain.

In traditional societies, each person and each household is a [[consumer]] as well as a [[production, costs, and pricing|producer]].  [[Social network]]s create mutual understandings to promote the survival of these [[social unit]]s in the face of [[scarcity]]; these social ties operate to prevent the economic actors in traditional societies from behaving to maximize personal [[Profit (economics)|profit]].  Traditional understandings arise as to the relative value of various goods and services; they are not independently renegotiated for each transaction in an impersonal, anonymous [[Market (economics)|market]].  Traditional [[staple food]]s and other goods deemed necessary for the survival of the community acquire customary prices; dearth or plenty should be shared by all.  These traditional understandings acquire the force of [[convention (norm)|custom]], and with increased social complexity may eventually acquire the force of [[law]].

''[[The Efficient Society]]'' by [[Joseph Heath]] discusses the nature of a moral economy in these terms, and argues that [[Canada]] has achieved the proper balance between social needs and [[economic freedom]], and as such comes close to being a moral economy.  Other economists such as [[John P. Powelson]] relate the concept of a "moral economy" to the balance of [[economic power]]; in their view, a moral economy is an economy in which economic factors are balanced against ethical norms in the name of [[social justice]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

''Right Relationship'' by Brown and Garver, discusses the urgent need for achieving an economy that is recognized to be a subsidiary of the overall ecosystem of the planet.  They address key questions regarding the purpose, function, appropriate size, fairness, and governance of a world economic system and propose new ideas to place our economy in correct relationship with the Earth's ecosystem.  They argue that such a '''moral economy''' is essential if we are to avoid systemic collapse as our ''growth economy'' outstrips the Earth's limited ability to recycle our waste, and as the Earth's inventory of critical raw materials and minerals is used up, in the face of growing population and growing affluence within those populations.

==Economics and social norms==
In a related sense, "moral economy" is also a name given in [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]] to the interplay between [[culture|cultural]] [[mores]] and economic activity.  It describes the various ways in which custom and social pressure coerce economic actors in a society to conform to [[tradition]]al [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s even at the expense of [[Profit (economics)|profit]].

Prior to the rise of [[classical economics]] in the eighteenth century, the economies in Europe and its North American colonies were governed by a variety of (formal and informal) regulations designed to prevent "greed" from overcoming "morality". In its most formal manifestations, examples such as the traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] prohibitions on [[usury]] represent the limits imposed by religious values on economic activity, and as such are part of the moral economy. [[Law]]s that determine what sort of [[contract]]s will be given effect by the [[judiciary]], and what sort of contracts are [[void (law)|void]] or [[voidable]], often incorporate concepts of a moral economy; in many jurisdictions, traditionally a contract involving [[gambling]] was considered [[void (law)|void in law]] because it was against [[public policy]].  These restrictions on [[freedom of contract]] are the results of moral economy.  According to the beliefs which inspired these laws, economic transactions were supposed to be based on mutual obligation, not individual gain.  In colonial Massachusetts, for example, prices and markets were highly regulated, even the fees physicians could charge.&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, ''Transformations in American Law'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of moral economy are more informal.  In the sixteenth and seventeenth century, for instance, clergymen often preached against various economic practices that were not strictly illegal, but were deemed to be "uncharitable".&lt;ref&gt;Collinson, "Puritanism and the Poor"&lt;/ref&gt; Their condemnations of selling food at high prices or raising rents probably influenced the behavior of many people who regarded themselves as Christian and worried about their reputations.

Likewise, during the rapid expansion of capitalism over the past several centuries, the tradition of a pre-capitalist "moral economy" was used to justify popular action against unscrupulous merchants and traders. For example, the poor regularly rioted against grain merchants who raised their prices in years of dearth in an attempt to reassert the concept of the [[just price]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, "Moral Economy of the English Crowd"; Randall and Charlesworth, ''Moral Economy and Popular Protest''; Bohstedt, ''The Politics of Provisions''&lt;/ref&gt; The Marxist historian [[E. P. Thompson]] emphasized the continuing force of this tradition in his pioneering article on "The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century" (1971). Later historians and sociologists have uncovered the same phenomenon in a variety of other situations, including peasants' riots in continental Europe during the nineteenth century and in many developing countries in the twentieth. The political scientist [[James C. Scott]], for example, showed how this ideology could be used as a method of resisting authority in ''[[The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Subsistence and Rebellion in Southeast Asia]]'' (1976).

It must be remembered, however, that sometimes a moral economy may not act in conformity to [[morality]] as it is now generally understood.  Social pressures to enforce [[racial segregation]] even when willing buyers and sellers would erode the racial barriers, are clearly an example of cultural pressures imposing economic inefficiency, and therefore fall within the purview of moral economy.&lt;ref&gt;Van Tessel, "Only the Law"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utopian moral economies==
In modern times, "utopian moral economies" have arisen to systematically reorganize their economic system to reflect a particular moral or ethical code that rejects the free-market ethos of capitalist economies. Societies that pursue some derivative of [[Socialism]] or [[Communism]] are obvious examples of this impulse, along with small-scale attempts in the form of the Israeli [[kibbutz]] and the [[intentional communities]] of the 1960s and 70s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Very few of these experiments—with the possible exception of the kibbutz—turned out the way their founders had imagined. Unsurprisingly, a revolutionary reorganization of some of the most fundamental parts of society often resulted in the severe dislocation of many people's everyday lives and the loss of whole generations to schemes like Stalin's failed policy of [[collective farming]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, many of the small and pragmatic attempts to make the capitalist economy more moral (e.g. fair trade, moral investment funds, the development of renewable energy sources, recycling, cooperatives, etc.) have grown from the same impulse that drove the utopian revolutionaries. These developments, however, do not fully realize their intentions, being fundamentally at odds with the mechanisms in the capitalist economy, such as cyclical consumption, the inherent duplicity of goods in competition, and the process of "externalizing" those costs which are not directly pertinent to an actor's finances.

'''''Oro''''' ({{literal translation|Gold}}) is a 2016 [[Philippines|Filipino]] film written and directed by [[Alvin Yapan]], starring [[Irma Adlawan]], [[Mercedes Cabral]], and [[Joem Bascon]].&lt;ref name="rappler8"&gt;{{cite news|title=8 MMFF 2016 entries revealed|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/152823-mmff-2016-entries-full-list|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=Rappler|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, which was produced by Feliz Film Productions and distributed by Solar Pictures,&lt;ref name="pep"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dimaculangan|first1=Jocelyn|title=MMFF 2016 boldly touted to be "renaissance in Philippine cinema"|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/mmff/25075/mmff-2016-predicted-to-be-renaissance-in-philippine-cinema?ref=ob_related|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=Philippine Entertainment Portal|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal Inc.|date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an official entry to the [[2016 Metro Manila Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="rappler8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here are the films competing in MMFF 2016|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/11/18/16/here-are-the-films-competing-in-mmff-2016|website=ABS-CBN News|accessdate=22 November 2016|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was based on the 2014 murder of four miners in Sitio Lahuy, Barangay Gata, [[Caramoan]], [[Camarines Sur]] by armed members of Sagip Kalikasan Task Force, an environmental group formed in 2004 by former Camarines Sur governor [[Luis Villafuerte]].

During its screening in the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival, the film was criticized for scenes of animal cruelty, wherein a dog was shown beaten to death, disemboweled, cooked and eaten by the actors. An investigation conducted by the festival's executive committee found that a dog was indeed killed and disemboweled during filming but wasn't eaten by the actors. The executive committee ordered the producers to edit out the scenes of animal cruelty from the film. It also ordered the film's withdrawal from movie theaters and banned the film's director and producers from participating in the festival for one year. The animal welfare group [[Philippine Animal Welfare Society]] (PAWS) also filed a lawsuit against the film director and production company for violating the Philippine Animal Welfare Law.

==Synopsis==
A secluded community dependent on mining is disrupted by an armed group who claims to be a representative of the government which causes a change in the traditional way of life of the community's residents. The community is led by a Barangay chairperson ([[Irma Adlawan]]) who decides to deal with the armed group exploiting their simple and previously undisturbed community.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
''Oro'' is largely based on a true story on killings which took place in 2014. The real life event now dubbed as the "Gata Four Massacre" involved the killing of four miners in Barangay Gata, [[Caramoan]], [[Camarines Sur]]. In a March 2016 ''Bicol Today'' report, the alleged perpetrators were described as "enjoying freedom as employees of the Sagip Kalikasan Task Force" (SKTF). Alvin Yapan, the film's writer and director stated that significant parts of the event were fictionalized as a move of sensitivity to the case of the families of the victims.&lt;ref name="toughissues"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Villano|first1=Alex|title=MMFF 2016: Based on true events, 'Oro' brings tough issues to light|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/156235-oro-movie-irma-adlawan-joem-bascon-mercedes-cabral-facts|accessdate=2 January 2017|work=Rappler|date=30 December 2016|language=English, Filipino}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SKTF for example, was fictionalized as the Patrol Kalikasan.&lt;ref name=pawsprobe&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tantiangco|first1=Aya|title=PAWS seeks probe on depiction of animal cruelty in ‘Oro’|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/594249/lifestyle/paws-seeks-probe-on-depiction-of-animal-cruelty-in-oro|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=GMA News|date=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camarines Sur Representative and ''Oro'' producer Wimpy Fuentebella approached Yapan to direct ''Oro''. Yapan initially refused saying that he doesn't want to be involved in politics but later accepted the project after Fuentebella approached him again at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] where Yapan teaches. Fuentebella appealed to Yapan to direct the film to advance an advocacy as an Atenean and Bicolano. Yapan asked for full creative control over the production of ''Oro'' and was assured that the film isn't a propaganda or a smear campaign.&lt;ref name="toughissues"/&gt;

===Filming===
The film was shot in the Sitio Lahuy, Barangay Gata, Caramoan, Camarines Sur, where the 2014 killings took place. Both residents and non-residents participated as extras in the making of the film. Some of the extras were later found out by Yapan to be relatives of the victims and the director expressed reluctance saying that their participation may worsen their trauma from the killings. The victims' relatives insisted to be part of the film saying to the production team that it's their story and the film is them. Yapan described the experience of the victims' relatives working with the film as seemingly therapeutic adding that they "kept silent about the entire thing and now people are actually interested in the material so this is their chance to speak. And their way of speaking is to act a particular thing that they actually experienced"&lt;ref name="toughissues"/&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Oro'' is among the four least performing films in terms of box office sales during the opening day of the [[2016 Metro Manila Film Festival]] on 25 December 2016.&lt;ref name="topped"&gt;{{cite news|title=Which film topped the 2016 MMFF box office?|url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/which-film-topped-the-2016-mmff-box-office/|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=BusinessMirror|date=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reports of animal cruelty in the film came out, the festival's executive ordered the movie withdrawn from movie theaters beginning 4 January 2017.

===Critical response===
Notwithstanding scenes of animal cruelty in the film, the film received positive reviews from several movie critics. Oggs Cruz of [[Rappler]] called the film a "power discourse". He writes: "The film, however, is not just about injustice, which is quite an obvious concept. It is about the fickle nature of justice, of the impossibility of organized society to pinpoint with exactitude what equates as just in a world of multiple advocacies and perspectives. This is what makes the film overwhelmingly compelling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/156857-oro-movie-review-irma-adlawan-joem-bascon |title='Oro' Review: Powerful discourse |author=Cruz, Oggs |date=28 December 2016 |publisher=''[[Rappler]]'' |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Don Jaucian, writing for [[CNN Philippines]] said, "Yapan skillfully weaves the details of the town’s life through little stories of faith and redemption, stories that build up to a riveting portrait of greed, corruption, and helplessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnnphilippines.com/life/entertainment/film/2016/12/30/mmff-reviews-part-2.html |title=MMFF roundup, part 2: ‘Die Beautiful,’ ‘Oro,’ ‘Sunday Beauty Queen,’ and ‘Vince and Kath and James’ |author=Jaucian, Don |date=30 December 2016 |publisher=[[CNN Philippines]] |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camille Anne Arcilla, writing for ''[[BusinessWorld]]'' said, "Heavy as it may seem for Christmas entertainment, but it leaves a mark to the audience, not just as a moviegoer, but also as a member of a society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Arts&amp;Leisure&amp;title=search-for-gold-human-nature&amp;id=138291 |title=Search for gold, human nature |author=Arcilla, Camille Anne |date=28 December 2016 |publisher=''[[BusinessWorld]]'' |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bubbles Salvador of the [[Philippine Entertainment Portal]] called the film "intelligent, relevant, real" and adds that Yapan brilliantly tackles the issues that need to be brought to light in a film that has the elements an ordinary moviegoer looks for: a tight storyline, characters one can relate to, and a lesson at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/mmff/25279/mmff-2016-review-emoro-ema-gripping-eye-opener-inspired-by-real-life-caramoan-massacre |title=Oro, a gripping eye-opener inspired by real-life Caramoan massacre |author=Salvador, Bubbles |date=24 December 2016 |publisher=PEP.ph |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
The film was nominated for 10 awards in the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival. During the festival's awards night on 29 December 2016 held at the [[Kia Theater]] in [[Quezon City]], the film's lead actress, [[Irma Adlawan]] won the Best Actress award for her role as Kapitana. The film's cast also won Best Ensemble while the film received the Fernando Poe, Jr. Memorial Award for Excellence, which was later revoked after reports of animal cruelty in the film surfaced.

==Criticism==
===Animal cruelty during filming===
The scene in the film which depicts members of Patrol Kalikasan taking a dog of a villager to later slaughter and cook it elicited controversy.&lt;ref name=pawsprobe/&gt; Animal rights group [[Philippine Animal Welfare Society]] (PAWS) criticized the inclusion of the scene and alleged that the dog was actually killed in real life.&lt;ref name=fpjwithdraw&gt;{{cite news|title=MMFF ExeCom withdraws Fernando Poe Jr Memorial Award from 'Oro'|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157272-mmff-executive-committee-announces-withdrawal-fernando-poe-jr-memorial-award-oro|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=Rappler|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAWS called for an investigation regarding the certain scene saying that those involved are liable under Republic Act 8485 or the Animal Welfare Act. They pointed out that there was no permit application filed to the Bureau of Animal Industry and the Committee on Animal Welfare by either the filmmakers or the indigenous community. PAWS also added that if the dog slaughter was not deliberately filmed by the filmmakers, they said that the production team of ''Oro'' should have reported the incident instead of using the footage as part of their feature film.&lt;ref name=pawsprobe/&gt;

Yapan stated that neither he or a member of the film's cast were involved in the killing of the dog and that the production team only documented a  "culture of violence" in a remote portion of the country.&lt;ref name="editout"/&gt;

Following a closed-door meeting with the MMFF Executive Committee, the filmmakers and PAWS decided to censor or edit out the scene in question, as well as include an advisory warning viewers of graphic content, which they described as a "compromise". PAWS expressed disappointment in the decision, saying that the move "does not change the fact that a dog was killed" for the film describing the events in the scene as "a crime committed". The group also criticized the MMFF committee for not pulling out the film entirely alleging that they hide under a "technicality" in such that the production team of ''Oro'' was not directly involved in the killing of the dog. PAWS said that a "degree of ethics" dictates that the film makers should not have used the footage for their work.&lt;ref name="editout"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sallan|first1=Edwin|title=‘Oro’ director to edit out dog slaughter scene, PAWS vows legal action|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/entertainment/oro-director-to-edit-out-dog-slaughter-scene-paws-vows-legal-action/|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=InterAksyon.com|date=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yapan has expressed disappointment and noted that public attention regarding the film would be more directed to the dog slaughter scene rather than the case of the Gata 4 Massacre.&lt;ref name="editout"/&gt;

On 3 January 2017, the MMFF Executive Committee revoked the Fernando Poe Jr Memorial Award from ''Oro'' after a consultation with the family of the late [[Fernando Poe Jr.]]. They said that "without making any judgment on the artistic merit of the film or cinematic depiction", the controversy regarding the alleged killing of a dog in the making of ''Oro'' "effectively casts a doubt on the movie's ability to exemplify the human and cultural values espoused by the late Fernando Poe, Jr."&lt;ref name=fpjwithdraw&gt;{{cite news|title=MMFF ExeCom withdraws Fernando Poe Jr Memorial Award from 'Oro'|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/157272-mmff-executive-committee-announces-withdrawal-fernando-poe-jr-memorial-award-oro|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=Rappler|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2017, Superstar [[Nora Aunor]] called the fillmakers behind the controversial movie "Oro" liars for denying that a dog was killed during the shooting of the film. Both Aunor and Yapan attended the hearing of the Senate committee on public information and mass media over different issues concerning the [[Metro Manila Film Festival]] (MMFF). Yapan said nobody from the crew killed a dog. Aunor, however, refuted Yapan's statement, saying it was stated in the script that one dog will be killed. She earlier said that two dogs will be killed but then clarified the matter later on during the hearing. The actress also complained of not receiving a formal notice from the director nor the producer that she will no longer continue on with the project, despite already having attended a story conference.
Senator [[Grace Poe]], chair of the Senate panel conducting the hearing, gave Yapan an opportunity to apologize over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alvarez|first1=Katrina Charmaine|title=Nora Aunor calls Oro filmmakers liars for denying killing of dog for movie|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/596877/showbiz/nora-aunor-calls-oro-filmmakers-liars-for-denying-killing-of-dog-for-movie|accessdate=24 January 2017|work=GMANetwork.com|date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== 1985–1997: Early years ===
In 1985, Louie and Shelley Giglio founded Choice Ministries at Baylor University in Waco, TX.&lt;ref name="cbn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/bios/louiegiglio092409.aspx|title=Louie Giglio: The Heart Behind the Passion|accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choice Ministries began as a campus-based student ministry and after 10 years of ministry at Baylor, Louie and Shelley moved to Atlanta, GA. In 1997, Giglio founded Passion Conferences in Atlanta under the banner of Choice Ministries to see a spiritual awakening among college students all across the United States and the world. 

=== 1997–2007: National success ===

'''Shinboku-con''' was an annual four-day anime convention held during April at the Sawmill Creek Resort in [[Huron, Ohio]].

==Programming==
The convention typically offers anime showings, cosplay contest, dances, panels, professional wrestling, trading card tournaments, vendors/artist room, and video game tournaments.&lt;ref name="AC-2013"/&gt;

==History==
Shinboku-con was founded in 2007 by members of the [[Lorain County Community College]] Anime Society and Roleplayer's Association.&lt;ref name="sc2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://animecons.com/press/post/470/lorain-county-community-college-to-host-anime-con | title = Lorain County Community College to host anime con | publisher = AnimeCons.com | date = 2007-04-03 | accessdate = 2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the convention became a three-day event, and had its first industry guest, [[Tiffany Grant]].&lt;ref name="ac10shin"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://animecons.com/press/post/1048/tiffany-grant-and-gavin-goszka-to-appear-at-shinboku-con-2010 | title = Tiffany Grant and Gavin Goszka to appear at Shinboku-con 2010 | publisher = AnimeCons.com | date = 2010-02-17 | accessdate = 2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 three attendees were arrested at the convention, two men were involved in a dispute over the playing of a video game which resulted in a punch to the mouth and an officer being spit on.  Another man was arrested for an incident involving the damage of hotel property and underage consumption of alcohol.&lt;ref name="kotaku11"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kotaku: Three Men Arrested after Fisticuffs at Nerd Convention|url=http://kotaku.com/shinboku_con-2011/|accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://westlake.patch.com/articles/police-blotter-man-spits-on-officer-at-video-game-convention | title = Police Blotter: Man Spits on Officer at Video Game Convention  | publisher = WestlakePatch | accessdate = 2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention expanded to a partial fourth day in 2014.&lt;ref name="AC-2014"/&gt; Shinboku-con cancelled their 2015 event.&lt;ref name="AC-2015"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://animecons.com/events/info/6025/shinboku-con-2015 | title = Shinboku Con 2015 Information | publisher = AnimeCons.com | accessdate = 2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slush''' is a not-for-profit [[Startup company|startup]] and tech event. The main purpose of Slush is to facilitate meetings between the founders of start-ups and investors such as [[venture capitalist]]s, accomplished with events such as  "match-making" and pitching competitions. Slush aims to change attitudes towards entrepreneurship by providing a platform for youths and student volunteers to co-organize and build a world-wide startup community. Held annually in [[Helsinki]], Finland, it has grown from a 300-person conference in 2008 into one of the leading global startup event of its kind in 2017. In 2017, Slush gathered 20,000 attendees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hixon|first1=Todd|title=A Report From The Hot And Cool Nordic Venture Scene|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddhixon/2015/11/14/a-report-from-the-hot-and-cool-nordic-venture-scene/#7ea65134a22a|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 2,600 startups, 1,500 investors and 600 journalists coming in from over 130 countries to participate together in this global networking festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haaramo|first1=Eeva|title=Slush 2015 breaks records as Finland's startup scene flourishes|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500257911/Slush-2015-breaks-records-as-Finlands-startup-scene-flourishes|website=Computer Weekly|publisher=Computer Weekly|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Expedition of the Thousand}}
The '''British Legion''' was a voluntary military corps composed of Englishmen and Scots, who in 1860 made their mind up to join [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] during the [[Expedition of the thousand]] and fight for the [[unification of Italy]] together with the Italian Garibaldini against the Bourbon Army of [[The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].

Officially they were "Garibaldi Excursionists" to avoid any problems of diplomatic appearance and were recruited by major Styles, who appears in the engraving wearing his uniform and medal of the Crimean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TYRUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA371&amp;dq=of+some+hal-dozen+shoulders+Harwich+by+the+morning+trains+from+london+and+embarked+thence#v=onepage&amp;q=of+some+hal-dozen+shoulders+Harwich+by+the+morning+trains+from+london+and+embarked+thence&amp;f=false|title=The Illustrated London News|date=26 February 1860|publisher=Leighton|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The departure of "The British Legion" was financed by the "Garibaldi Special Fund Committee", one of the British organizations supporting the unification of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/31ec8715-63a5-4a29-98a4-bba99b336137|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruiting of the Legion==

The advertisement that enlisted them ran as follows: "Excursion to Sicily and Naples. All persons (particularly Members of Volunteer Rifle Corps) desirous of visiting Southern Italy and of aiding by their presence and influence the 'Cause of Garibaldi and Italy', may learn how to proceed by applying to the Garibaldi Committee at the offices, No. 8 Salisbury Street, London." &lt;ref&gt;Holyoake, i. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

==The volunteers==

The volunteers of the British Legion are described in a news item of ''The Illustrated London News'' of Oct. 20, 1860 regarding the departure from Harwich of 800&lt;ref&gt;600 according to G.M. Trevelyan - page 260&lt;/ref&gt; Englishmen and Scotchmen, who put their sword at the disposal of Garibaldi.

''The Illustrated London News'' remarks that, including volunteers already with Garibaldi, the total amount is a considerable more than 1,000 volunteers in the Garibaldian Army, often from middle-class or well-paid jobs, who left their country attracted by adventure and love of freedom, to fight for the liberty of a foreign country.

Before their departure from England other British volunteers were already at the side of Garibaldi in the South of Italy, such as Hugh Forbes, who was with Garibaldi in 1849, taking part in the defence of the Roman Republic against the French troops supporting the papacy,&lt;ref&gt;Garibaldi's defence of the Roman Republic 1848-1849 – [[George Macaulay Trevelyan]] - Longmans - 1919 - appendix N, pages 349-350&lt;/ref&gt; John Whitehead Peard, the "double" of Garibaldi or the charismatic Colonel John Dunne and his "English battalion" whose soldiers were all Sicilians and called Dunne "Milordo|, Dunne was wounded in Capua,&lt;ref&gt;Garibaldi and the making of Italy, George Macaulay Trevelyan – page 64, 241&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Wyndam and several others. John Whitehead Peard took the lead of the British Legion after its landing in Naples.

After having sailed from Great Britain by the ships Melazzo and Emperor, the British Legion landed in Naples on 15 October 1860 and took part in a fight, under the command of [[John Whitehead Peard]] in  Sant'Angelo up to the wall of [[Capua]], where two volunteers were killed and eight wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Garibaldi and the making of Italy, George Macaulay Trevelyan, pages 259-260&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if a half of the volunteers were enthusiastic and behaved properly, there were some roughs, principally from Glasgow and London who lacked discipline, so the Legion acquired a name for disorder similar to that which the Pope’s Irish had acquired in Rome. The Italians said "indulgently", "these men are not accustomed to a country where wine is cheap."

==The Legion on the battlefield ==

The Legion had a short war experience, after having advanced northwards with Garibaldi and a few regiments of Italians, on the morning of October 26, while they were in Vajrano, an Englishman from the Garibaldian outposts heard the war-cry ''"Viva il re !"'', "Long live the king!", usually shouted by the soldiers of the Bourbon Army, but it was the same war-cry from the Army of King Victor Emmnuel II, the future king of Italy, coming from the north. The red-shirts were replaced by the king’s Army in the final siege of the fortress in Gaeta, where the Bourbon Army surrendered in February 1861.

'''''The Charge of the Light Brigade''''' is a 1936 American [[historical period drama|historical]] [[adventure film]] made by [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; November 4, 1936, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; November 7, 1936, page 178.&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by [[Michael Curtiz]] and produced by [[Samuel Bischoff]], with [[Hal B. Wallis]] as executive producer, from a [[screenplay]] by Michael Jacoby and [[Rowland Leigh]], from a story by Michael Jacoby based on the poem ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]''  by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]. The music score was by [[Max Steiner]]; his first for Warners and the cinematography by [[Sol Polito]]. Scenes were shot at the following California locations: [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]], [[Sherwood Lake, California|Sherwood Lake]], Lasky Mesa, Chatsworth and [[Sonora, California|Sonora]]. The [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains were used for the [[Khyber Pass]] scenes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2098/The-Charge-of-the-Light-Brigade/notes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The film starred [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The story is very loosely based on the famous [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] that took place during the [[Crimean War]] (1853–56). Additionally, the story line includes  an event similar to the [[Siege of Cawnpore]] during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].

This was the second of eight films in which Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland starred together. A latter film was made in 1968, under the same name, ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' and starred [[Trevor Howard]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]].

== Plot ==
In 1854, Major Geoffrey Vickers ([[Errol Flynn]]) and his brother, Captain Perry Vickers ([[Patric Knowles]]), are stationed in [[British Raj|India]], with the 27th Lancers of the [[British Army]]. It is during the period of [[Company rule in India|East India Company dominance]] over the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Perry has secretly betrayed Geoffrey by stealing the love of his fiancee Elsa ([[Olivia de Havilland]]).

During an official visit to local tributary rajah, Surat Khan ([[C. Henry Gordon]]), Geoffrey saves the rajah's life while hunting, for which the rajah promises eternal gratitude. Later, Maj. Vickers is stationed at the British garrison of (fictional) Chukoti, along with British military families, within the part the [[North-Western Frontier]] controlled by Surat Khan. A British miscalculation leads to premature withdrawal of troops to (fictional) Lohora, unnecessarily exposing Chukoti. Faced with an overwhelming siege, the British commander, Col. Campbell ([[Donald Crisp]]), surrenders Chukoti to Surat Khan, who then massacres the inhabitants, including British families. Surat Khan allies his forces with [[Imperial Russia]], whom the British are fighting in the Crimean War, but spares Maj. Vickers and Elsa as they flee the slaughter. This repays his debt to Geoffrey.

The [[love triangle]] and the quest for [[Revenge|vengeance]] resolve at the [[Battle of Balaclava]]. Aware that Surat Khan is inspecting Russian positions opposite the 27th Lancers, Maj. Vickers secretly replaces written orders by Sir Charles Macefield ([[Henry Stephenson]]) to the commander of the [[Light cavalry|Light Brigade]], Sir Benjamin Warrenton ([[Nigel Bruce]]), to withdraw from the Balaclava Heights. Vickers instead orders the famous suicidal attack so the lancers can avenge the Chukoti massacre. Before the charge, Maj. Vickers reminds troops of the Chukoti Massacre and directs their anger: "Our objective is Surit Khan!" Although the 27th Lancers lose nearly all their 600 strength, they successfully breach Russian artillery positions. There, Vickers finds and kills Surat Khan, at the cost of his own life.

Later, it emerges that Maj. Vickers wrote to Sir Charles Macefield explaining his actions, a note which he forced his brother Perry to deliver, under threat of [[Court-martial|court martial]], so sparing his brother almost certain death. After receiving Maj. Vickers' explanation of why the charge happened, Macefield takes responsibility and burns the note to protect Vickers' good name.

==Production==

===Development===
The charge had been portrayed in a British movie, ''The Jaws of Death'', in 1930.

Warner Bros were inspired to make the film after ''[[The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (film)|Lives of a Bengal Lancer]]'' (1935) had been released to great popularity, ushering in a series of [[British Empire]] adventure tales. Michel Jacoby had developed a story based on the famous charge but, although Warners bought Jacoby's script, the final script was closer to ''Lives of a Bengal Lancer''.&lt;ref name="films"&gt;Tony Thomas, Rudy Behlmer * Clifford McCarty, ''The Films of Errol Flynn'', Citadel Press, 1969 p 45-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Warners wanted an all-British cast. [[Errol Flynn]] (Australian, but often considered Irish) had made such a strong impression in ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' he was removed from supporting [[Fredric March]] in ''[[Anthony Adverse]]'' to play the lead in ''Charge of the Light Brigade''.&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin's Big Business: Goldwyn's Leading Lady: A New Romantic Hero

New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 15 June 1936: 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Charge sequence===
The film comes to a climax at the [[Battle of Balaclava]], subject of [[Lord Tennyson]]'s poem ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]''. The lancers charge into the valley and brave the Russian cannons, and many are killed. Text from Tennyson's poem is superimposed on the screen, coupled with [[Max Steiner]]'s musical score. Director [[Michael Curtiz]], who did not have an excellent command of English, shouted "Bring on the empty horses", meaning "riderless horses". David Niven used this as the title of his book about the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].

The battlefield set was lined with [[tripwire]]s to trip the cavalry horses. For the filming of the climactic charge, 125 horses were tripped; of those, 25 were killed or had to be put down afterward. Errol Flynn, an accomplished horseman, was outraged by the animal cruelty and by director Michael Curtiz's seeming indifference and attacked Curtiz. They were pulled apart before any serious damage was done. The charge sequence forced the [[U.S. Congress]] to ensure the safety of animals in motion pictures; the [[ASPCA]] followed suit and banned tripwires from films. Unlike Flynn's other blockbuster films, because of the number of horses killed, it was never re-released by Warner Brothers, and so wouldn't be seen again until 1956, when Warner Brothers sold the rights to it and other pre-1950 films to [[Associated Artists Productions]] and it subsequently premiered on television.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8693">'''The Possum Drop''' is any one of several [[New Year's Day]] celebrations in which a [[Virginia opossum|possum]] is lowered from height at midnight. In contrast to other  [[List of objects dropped on New Year's Eve|events of its kind]], which typically involve replicas, a "possum drop" uses a live animal as its prop.

==Brasstown Drop==
In [[Brasstown, North Carolina (Unincorporated Community)|Brasstown, North Carolina]] an annual event at Clay's Corner [[convenience store]] is organized by proprietors Clay and Judy Logan.&lt;ref&gt;Clay's Corner - Clay &amp; Judy Logan Proprietors  http://www.clayscorner.com&lt;/ref&gt; At midnight on [[New Year's Eve]], instead of dropping an inanimate object, a plexiglass pyramid containing a live opossum was lowered from the roof of the store.&lt;ref&gt;New Year's Eve Lowering of the Opossum http://www.clayscorner.com/new-years-eve.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The animal is lowered to prevent the occurrence of injury. The opossum is not actually "dropped;" [[List of objects dropped on New Year's Eve|events of its kind]], it is lowered in the same manner as a [[time ball]]. 

The festivities include a contest with local men dressed as women to compete for the title "Miss Possum [[Drag queen|Queen]]" as well as [[bluegrass music]], snacks and beverages, and [[souvenir]] merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The New York Times|title=Keep Your Ball. We’ve Got the Possum.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/31/national/31POSS.html|author=JEFFREY GETTLEMAN|date=December 31, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Mountain Manager &amp; Associates  {{cite web |url=http://www.mountainmanager.net/localinterest.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723211948/http://www.mountainmanager.net/localinterest.htm |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tallapoosa Drop==
In [[Tallapoosa, Georgia]] Danny Welch organizes the annual event.&lt;ref&gt;The Possum Drop http://www.thepossumdrop.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WSBTV.com - Entertainment - Story: Georgia Town Celebrates New Years With Possum Drop  http://www.wsbtv.com/entertainment/22103037/detail.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The Possum Drop festivities include food vendors, T-shirts and souvenirs, live music, and fireworks after midnight. The Master of Ceremonies for the 2018 celebration is George Franco with Fox 5 News in Atlanta. Attendance in recent years has been in excess of 7000.  This event differs from the one in Brasstown, NC due to the usage of a taxidermied possum rather than a live one.

Spencer the famous possum is suspended in a wire ball wrapped with Christmas lights and is kept at ground level most of the night to allow spectators to see and have pictures taken with him. At about 11:30 PM he is raised to his full height to the top of the Cain Law Firm Building and at midnight amidst great fanfare and cheers is slowly lowered to the ground to signify the start of the new year. A living animal is not lowered: Spencer was a real opossum found dead in the wild and was stuffed by local [[Taxidermy|taxidermist]] Bud Jones. Spencer's name is a tribute to Ralph L. Spencer.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;RoadsideGeorgia.com http://roadsidegeorgia.com/city/tallapoosa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The event has grown over the last five years and attracts visitors from across the country who travel to Tallapoosa, Ga to celebrate New Year's Eve. The event has caught the attention of local and national media. The Learning Channel(TLC) chose The Possum Drop in Tallapoosa, Ga. as the location to film the New Years Special for their hit series "[[Here Comes Honey Boo Boo#Criticism|Here comes Honey Boo Boo]]" which will air in February or March 2014

==Opposition==
Possum drops have been subject to criticism and protest from [[PETA]], an organization that considers the drop a form of [[animal cruelty]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;A New Year's Tradition Lives, But the 4-Legged Star Doesn't. https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E7DF1631F931A35752C0A9629C8B63&lt;/ref&gt; PETA successfully sued to stop the 2013 Brasstown possum drop, under the premise that the state wildlife commission did not have the authority to issue the permits for such an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shaffer, Josh|date=November 13, 2012|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/11/13/2481006/opossum-drop-halted-in-brasstown.html|title=NC judge halts Brasstown's Opossum Drop|work=Raleigh News-Observer|accessdate=November 14, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115214515/http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/11/13/2481006/opossum-drop-halted-in-brasstown.html|archivedate=November 15, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Carolina General Statue 113-274-(c)-(1c) appears to authorize the state wildlife commission to issue such permits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_113/GS_113-274.html N.C.G.S 113-274]&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{Quote box 
|quote = 
(c)        The Wildlife Resources Commission may issue the following permits:

(1b)      Captivity Permit. - Authorizes the possession of live wildlife that may lawfully be permitted to be retained alive, in accordance with governing rules of the Wildlife Resources Commission. This permit may not substitute for any required collection license or captivity license, but may be temporarily issued for possession of wild animals or wild birds pending action on a captivity license or following its denial or termination. If this permit is issued for fish to be held indefinitely, the Wildlife Resources Commission may provide for periodic renewals of the permit, at least once each three years, to insure a review of the circumstances and conditions under which fish are kept. Wild animals and wild birds kept temporarily in captivity under this permit must be humanely treated and in accordance with any stipulations in the permit, but the standards of caging and care applicable to species kept under the captivity license do not apply unless specified in the permit. Any substantial deviation from reasonable requirements imposed by rule or administratively under the authority of this section renders the possession of the wildlife unlawful.

}}

In spite of this, the organizers used a dead opossum instead, after deciding they could not afford legal expenses that could result from defying PETA's request as they had originally planned to do.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; PETA did not object to using an already dead animal.&lt;ref name=observer122914&gt;Jarvis, Craig (December 29, 2014).

Retrieved December 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The North Carolina legislature passed a law in 2013 to expressly allow the commission to issue such permits, and the Brasstown event resumed in 2014  Thousands local residents and from all over the US signed petitions to stop this event using a live opossum.&lt;ref name=wtvr-possumdrop&gt;{{cite web|title=Controversial possum drop prevails in NC|url=http://wtvr.com/2014/01/01/possum-drop-brasstown/|work=WTVR|publisher=[[Tribune Broadcasting]]|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brasstown received more national attention for the 2015 New Year Possum Drop when PETA again filed a motion to prevent Clay Logan from obtaining a capture permit; Logan had already decided, due to time concerns, not to obtain a state permit for that year's drop.&lt;ref name=observer122914/&gt;

	
Many residents of the city of Tallapoosa consider the event and its production quality to be "[[redneck]]" and are against using the possum moniker to promote "Possum Snout", a nickname considered demeaning to the history of Tallapoosa (which means "Golden Water" or "Gold In Water" in the language of the [[Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas|Native American]] Muscogee).[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Possum_Drop&amp;oldid=588388731#cite_note-10 10][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Possum_Drop&amp;oldid=588388731#cite_note-autogenerated2-9 9][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Possum_Drop&amp;oldid=588388731#cite_note-11 11][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Possum_Drop&amp;oldid=588388731#cite_note-12 12]

While it was approved for marketed in several countries, it failed a Phase III trial in the U.S. due to toxicity and never received FDA approval.  It was discontinued by [[Wyeth]] in 1997 because of the risk of severe liver toxicity and death. It was sold under the tradename '''Alredase'''.

'''''United States v. Schooner Amistad''''', 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 518 (1841), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case resulting from the rebellion of Africans on board the Spanish [[schooner]] ''[[La Amistad]]'' in 1839.&lt;ref name="usamistad"&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. The Amistad|40|518|1841|Pet.|15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an unusual [[freedom suit]] that involved international issues and parties, as well as United States law. The historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] described it in 1969 as the most important court case involving slavery before being eclipsed by that of [[Dred Scott]] in 1857.&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cornish | first1 = Dudley T. | year = 1988 | title = Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/civil_war_history/v034/34.1.cornish.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Civil War History | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 79–80 | doi = 10.1353/cwh.1988.0011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schooner was traveling along the coast of [[Cuba]] on its way to a port for re-sale of the slaves. The African captives, who had been kidnapped in the area of [[Sierra Leone]] in [[West Africa]] and illegally sold into slavery and shipped to Cuba, escaped their shackles and took over the ship. They killed the captain and the cook; two other crew members escaped in a lifeboat. The Africans directed the two Spanish navigator survivors to return them to Africa. The crew tricked them, sailing north at night. ''La Amistad'' was later apprehended near [[Long Island, New York]], by the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] (1790 predecessor  before 1915 of the modern [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]]) and taken into custody. The widely publicized court cases in the United States federal district court and eventually to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1841, which addressed international issues, helped the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] anti-slavery movement.

In 1840, a federal district court found that the transport of the kidnapped Africans across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] slave ship ''Tecora'' was in violation of laws and accepted treaties against the [[international slave trade]] by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]], [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], and the [[United States]]. The captives were ruled to have acted as free men when they fought to escape their kidnapping and illegal confinement. The court ruled the Africans were entitled to take whatever legal measures necessary to secure their freedom, including the use of force. Under international and sectional pressure, eighth American President [[Martin Van Buren]] (1782-1862, served 1837-1841), ordered the case appealed to the Supreme Court. It affirmed the lower district court ruling on March 9, 1841, and authorized the release of the Africans, but overturned the additional order of the lower court that they be returned to Africa at government expense.

Supporters arranged for temporary housing of the Africans in [[Farmington, Connecticut]] as well as funds for travel. In 1842 they transported by ship those who wanted to return to Africa, together with American Christian missionaries.

==Facts==
===Rebellion at sea and capture===
[[File:Sengbe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph Cinqué|Sengbe Pieh]], leader of the ''La Amistad'' uprising, pictured as a Muslim (1839). Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library&lt;ref name="beinecke"&gt;[http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/dl_crosscollex/brbldl_getrec.asp?fld=img&amp;id=1313221 ''A true history of the African chief Jingua and his comrades : with a description of the Kingdom of Mandingo, and of the manners and customs of the inhabitants, an account of King Sharka, of Gallinas : a sketch of the slave trade and horrors of the middle passage, with the proceedings on board the "long, low, black schooner," Amistad.'' (Hartford, 1839)]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On June 27, 1839, ''[[La Amistad]]'' ("Friendship"), a Spanish vessel, departed from the port of [[Havana]], Cuba (then a Spanish colony), for the [[Camagüey Province|Province of Puerto Principe]], also in Cuba. The masters of ''La Amistad'' were the ship's captain Ramón Ferrer, José Ruiz, and Pedro Montez, all Spanish nationals. With Ferrer was his personal slave, Antonio. Ruiz was transporting 49 Africans, entrusted to him by the governor-general of Cuba. Montez held four additional Africans, also entrusted to him by the governor-general.&lt;ref name="587-8"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=40&amp;page=518 ''US v. The Amistad''], pp. 587–8&lt;/ref&gt; As the voyage normally took only four days, the crew had brought four days’ worth of rations, not anticipating the strong headwind that slowed the schooner. On July 2, 1839, one of the Africans, [[Joseph Cinqué|Cinqué]], freed himself and the other captives using a file that had been found and kept by a woman who, like them, had been on the ''[[Tecora]]'' (the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ship that had transported them illegally as slaves from West Africa to Cuba).

The [[Mende people|Mende]] Africans killed the ship's cook, Celestino, who had told them that they were to be killed and eaten by their captors. The slaves also killed Captain Ferrer; the struggle resulted as well in the deaths of two Africans. Two sailors escaped in a lifeboat. The Africans spared the lives of the two masters who could navigate the ship, José Ruiz and Pedro Montez, upon the condition that they would return the ship east back across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to Africa. They also spared the captain's personal slave, Antonio, a [[Creole peoples|creole]],&lt;ref&gt;James Covey deposition to the court&lt;/ref&gt;  and used him as an interpreter with Ruiz and Montez.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/barber/barber.html Barber, J.W. (1840). ''A History of the Amistad Captives: Being a Circumstantial Account of the Capture of the Spanish Schooner Amistad, by the Africans on Board; Their Voyage, and Capture near Long Island, New York; with Biographical Sketches of Each of the Surviving Africans also, An Account of the Trials Had on Their Case, before the District and Circuit Courts of the United States, for the District of Connecticut''], p. 7 [Electronic Edition. ]. (''Documenting the American South'', University of North Carolina)&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew deceived the Africans and steered ''La Amistad'' north along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] of the United States, where the ship was sighted repeatedly. They dropped anchor half a mile off eastern [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on August 26, 1839, at [[Culloden Point]]. Some of the Africans went ashore to procure water and provisions from the hamlet of [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]]. The vessel was discovered by the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|United States Revenue Cutter Service ship]] {{USS|Washington|1837|6}}. Lieutenant Thomas R. Gedney, commanding the USRCS cutter (ship), saw some of the Africans on shore and, assisted by his officers and crew, took custody of ''La Amistad'' and the Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africanamericans.com/Amistad.htm |title=The U.S. Navy and the Amistad |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |work=AfricanAmericans.com |publisher=Americans.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking them to the [[Long Island Sound]] port of [[New London, Connecticut]], he presented officials with a written claim for his property rights under international [[admiralty law]] for salvage of the vessel, the cargo, and the Africans. Gedney allegedly chose to land in [[Connecticut]] because slavery was still technically legal there, unlike in nearby New York State. He hoped to profit from sale of the Africans.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brion Davis|Davis, David Brion]]  ''[[Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World]]''. Oxford University Press, USA, 2006, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Gedney transferred the captured Africans into the custody of the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], at which time legal proceedings began.&lt;ref name="587-8"/&gt;

===British pressure===
{{Slavery}}
As the British had entered into a treaty with Spain prohibiting the slave trade south of the equator, they considered it a matter of [[international law]] that the United States release the Africans.  They applied diplomatic pressure to achieve this, including invoking the [[Treaty of Ghent]] with the US, which jointly enforced their respective prohibitions against the [[international slave trade]].

While the legal battle continued, [[Richard Robert Madden|Dr. Richard R. Madden]], "who served on behalf of the British commission to suppress the African slave trade in Havana," arrived to testify.&lt;ref name="Revolt"/&gt; He made a deposition "that some twenty-five thousand slaves were brought into Cuba every year – with the wrongful compliance of, and personal profit by, Spanish officials."&lt;ref name="Revolt"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Amistad Revolt: Memory, Slavery, and the Politics of Identity in the United States and Sierra Leone |author=Iyunolu Folayan Osagie|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2010|page=11|isbn=0820327255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madden also "told the court that his examinations revealed that the defendants were brought directly from Africa and could not have been residents of Cuba," as the Spanish had claimed.&lt;ref name="Revolt"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2013}} Madden (who later had an audience with [[Queen Victoria]] concerning the case) conferred with the British Minister in Washington, D.C., [[Henry Stephen Fox]], who pressured U.S. Secretary of State [[John Forsyth (Georgia)|John Forsyth]] on behalf "of her Majesty's Government."&lt;ref name="Congress"&gt;{{cite book|article=Deposition of Richard R. Madden| title=Public Documents Printed by order of The Senate of the United States, during the second session of the 26th Congress|author=United States Congress|volume=Volume IV, containing documents from No 151 to No 235|date=January 20, 1841|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox wrote "...Great Britain is also bound to remember that the law of Spain, which finally prohibited the slave-trade throughout the Spanish dominions, from the date of the 30th&amp;nbsp;of May, 1820, the provisions of which law are contained in the King of Spain's royal cedula of the 19th&amp;nbsp;December, was passed, in compliance with a treaty obligation to that effect, by which the Crown of Spain had bound itself to the Crown of Great Britain, and for which a valuable compensation, in return, was given by Great Britain to Spain; as may be seen by reference to the 2d, 3d, and 4th articles of a public treaty concluded between Great Britain and Spain on the 23d of September, 1817.

"It is next to be observed, that Great Britain and the United States have mutually engaged themselves to each other, by the 10th article of the [[treaty of Ghent]], to use their best endeavors for the entire abolition of the African slave-trade; and there can be no doubt of the firm intention of both parties religiously to fulfill the terms of that engagement.

"Now, the unfortunate Africans whose case is the subject of the present representation, have been thrown by accidental circumstances into the hands of the authorities of the United States Government whether these persons shall recover the freedom to which they are entitled, or whether they shall be reduced to slavery, in violation of known laws and contracts publicly passed, prohibiting the continuance of the African slave-trade by Spanish subjects.

"It is under these circumstance that her Majesty's Government anxiously hope that the President of the United States will find himself empowered to take such measures, in behalf of the aforesaid Africans, as shall secure to them the possession of their liberty, to which, without doubt they are by law entitled."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

Forsyth responded that under the separation of powers in the U.S. Constitution, the President could not influence the court case. He said that the question of whether the "negroes of the Amistad" had been enslaved in violation of the Treaty was still an open one, "and this Government would with great reluctance erect itself into a tribunal to investigate such questions between two friendly sovereigns."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt; He noted that when the facts were determined, they could be taken into account. He suggested that if the Court found for Spanish rights of property, the Africans would be returned to Cuba. At that point, Great Britain and Spain could argue their questions of law and treaties between them.&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

===Spanish argument===
Secretary of State Forsyth requested from the Spanish Minister, Chevalier de Argaiz, "a copy of the laws now in force in the island of Cuba relative to slavery."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt; In response, the Captain General of Cuba sent Argaiz "everything on the subject, which had been determined since the treaty concluded in 1818 between Spain and England".&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt; The Minister also expressed dismay that the Africans had not already been returned to Spanish control.&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

The Spanish maintained that none but a Spanish court could have jurisdiction over the case. The Spanish minister stated "I do not, in fact, understand how a foreign court of justice can be considered competent to take cognizance of an offence committed on board of a Spanish vessel, by Spanish subjects, and against Spanish subjects, in the waters of a Spanish territory; for it was committed on the coasts of this island, and under the flag of this nation."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt; The Minister noted that the Spanish had recently turned over American sailors "belonging to the crew of the American vessel 'William Engs'", whom it had tried by request of their captain and the American consul. The sailors had been found guilty of mutiny and sentenced to "four years' confinement in a fortress."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt; Other American sailors had protested this and when the American ambassador raised the issue with the Spaniards, on March 20, 1839 "her Majesty, having taken into consideration all the circumstances, decided that the said seamen should be placed at the disposition of the American consul, seeing that the offence was committed in one of the vessels and under the flag of his nation, and not on shore."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt; The Spaniards asked how, if America had demanded that these sailors in an American ship be turned over to them despite being in a Spanish port, they could now try the Spanish mutineers.

The Spaniards held that just as America had ended its importation of African slaves but maintained a legal domestic population, so too had Cuba. It was up to Spanish courts to determine "whether the Negroes in question" were legal or illegal slaves under Spanish law, "but never can this right justly belong to a foreign country."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

The Spaniards maintained that, even if it was believed that the Africans were being held as slaves in violation of "the celebrated treaty of humanity concluded between Spain and Great Britain in 1835", this would be a violation of "the laws of Spain; and the Spanish Government, being as scrupulous as any other in maintaining the strict observance of the prohibitions imposed on, or the liberties allowed to, its subjects by itself, will severely chastise those of them who fail in their duties."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

The Spaniards pointed out that by American law the jurisdiction over a "vessel on the high seas, in time of peace, engaged in a lawful voyage, is, according to the laws of nations, under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State to which her flag belongs; as much so as if constituting a part of its own domain. ...if such ship or vessel should be forced, by stress of weather, or other unavoidable cause, into the port and under the jurisdiction of a friendly Power, she, and her cargo, and persons on board, with their property, and all the rights belonging to their personal relations as established by the laws of the State to which they belong, would be placed under the protection which the laws of nations extend to the unfortunate under such circumstances."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt; The Spaniards demanded that the U.S. "apply these proper principles to the case of the schooner ''Amistad''."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

The Spanish were further encouraged that their view would win out when U.S. Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] and the Senate's Committee of Foreign Relations on April 15, 1840 issued a statement announcing complete "conformity between the views entertained by the Senate, and the arguments urged by the [Spanish Minister] Chevalier de Argaiz" concerning ''La Amistad''.&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

===Applicable law===
The Spanish categorized the Africans as property to have the case fall under [[Pinckney's Treaty]] of 1795. They protested when Judge [[William Jay (jurist)|William Jay]] construed a statement by their Minister as seeming to demand "the surrender of the negroes apprehended on board the schooner ''Amistad'', as murderers, and not as property; that is to say founding his demand on the [[law of nations]], and not on the treaty of 1795."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

The Spanish pointed out that the statement Jay was referring to was one where the Spanish minister was "speaking of the crime committed by the negroes [slave revolt], and the punishment which they merit". They went on to point out that the Minister had stated that a payment to compensate the owners "would be a slender compensation; for though the property should remain, as it ought to remain, unimpaired, public vengeance would be frustrated".&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

Judge Jay took issue with the Spanish Minister's request that the Africans be turned over to Spanish authorities (which seemed to imply that they were fugitives instead of misbehaving property), because the 1795 treaty said that property should be restored directly to the control of its owners. The Spanish denied that this meant that the Minister had waived the contention that they were property.

By insisting that the case fell under the treaty of 1795, the Spanish were invoking the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution, which would put the clauses of the treaty above the state laws of Connecticut or New York, where the ship had been taken into custody, "no one who respects the laws of the country ought to oppose the execution of the treaty, which is the supreme law of the country."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt; The case was already in the federal district court.

The Spanish also sought to avoid talk about the Law of Nations, as some of their opponents argued that America had a duty under the Law of Nations to treat the Africans with the same deference they would accord any other foreign sailors.

[[John Quincy Adams]] later argued this issue before the Supreme Court in 1841, saying, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Africans were in possession, and had the presumptive right of ownership; they were in peace with the United States:...they were not pirates; they were on a voyage to their native homes...the ship was theirs, and being in immediate communication with the shore, was in the territory of the State of New York; or, if not, at least half the number were actually on the soil of New York, and entitled to all the provisions of the law of nations, and the protection and comfort which the laws of that State secure to every human being within its limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Amistad Argument [Note:as argued before the US Supreme Court]|author=John Quincy Adams|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=1841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When pressed with questions concerning the Law of Nations, the Spanish referred to a concept of [[Hugo Grotius]] (credited as one of the originators of the Law of Nations).{{clarify|reason=What was the purpose of this legal argument?|date=August 2017}} Specifically, they noted that "the usage, then, of demanding fugitives from a foreign Government, is confined...to crimes which affect the Government and such as are of extreme atrocity."&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

==Judgment==
===Circuit Court===

{{Events leading to US Civil War}}

A case before the [[United States circuit court|circuit court]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], Connecticut, was filed in September 1839, charging the Africans with  [[mutiny]] and murder on ''La Amistad''. The court ruled that it lacked [[jurisdiction]], because the alleged acts took place on a Spanish ship in Spanish waters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  It was entered into the docket books of the federal court as ''United States'' v. ''Cinque, et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Incited by the Love of Liberty" The Amistad Captives and the Federal Courts|url = https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2003/spring/amistad-1.html|website = www.archives.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-11|last = Ragsdale|first = Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various parties filed property claims with the [[United States district court|district court]] to many of the African captives, to the ship, and to its cargo: Ruiz and Montez, Lieutenant Gedney, and Captain Henry Green (who had met the Africans while on shore on Long Island and claimed to have helped in their capture). The Spanish government asked that the ship, cargo and slaves be restored to Spain under the [[Pinckney treaty]] of 1795 between Spain and the United States. Article 9 of this treaty holds that "all ships and merchandises of what nature soever, which shall be rescued out of the hands of pirates or robbers on the high seas, …shall be restored, entire, to the true proprietor." The United States filed a claim on behalf of Spain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

[[File:Lewis Tappan portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Lewis Tappan]], American evangelical abolitionist and founder of the "Amistad committee"]]
The [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] had formed the "Amistad Committee", headed by New York City merchant [[Lewis Tappan]], and had collected money to mount a defense of the Africans. Initially, communication with the Africans was difficult, since they spoke neither English nor Spanish. Professor [[Willard Gibbs (linguist)|J. Willard Gibbs, Sr.]] learned from the Africans to count to ten in their [[Mende language]]. He went to the docks of New York City, and counted aloud in front of sailors until he located a person able to understand and translate. He found [[James Covey]], a twenty-year-old sailor on the British man-of-war {{HMS|Buzzard|1834|6}}. Covey was a former slave from West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/barber/barber.html Barber (1840). ''A History of the Amistad captives''], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolitionists filed charges of assault, [[kidnapping]], and [[false imprisonment]] against Ruiz and Montez. Their arrest in New York City in October 1839 had outraged pro-slavery rights advocates and the Spanish government. Montez immediately posted bail and went to Cuba. Ruiz, "more comfortable in a New England setting (and entitled to many amenities not available to the Africans), hoped to garner further public support by staying in jail....Ruiz, however, soon tired of his martyred lifestyle in jail and posted bond. Like Montez, he returned to Cuba".&lt;ref name="Revolt"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2013}} Outraged, the Spanish minister Cavallero Pedro Alcantara Argaiz made "caustic accusations against America's judicial system and continued to condemn the abolitionist affront. Ruiz's imprisonment only added to Argaiz's anger, and he pressured Forsyth to seek ways to throw out the case altogether."&lt;ref name="Revolt"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2013}} The Spanish held that the bailbonds that the men had to acquire (so that they could leave jail and return to Cuba) caused them a grave financial burden, and "by the treaty of 1795, no obstacle or impediment [to leave the U.S.] should have [been] placed" in their way.&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;

On January 7, 1840, all the parties, with the Spanish minister representing Ruiz and Montez, appeared before the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut|U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut]] and presented their arguments.&lt;ref name="amistad590"&gt;''US v. The Amistad'', p. 590&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolitionists' main argument before the district court was that a treaty between Britain and Spain of 1817 and a subsequent pronouncement by the Spanish government had outlawed the slave trade across the Atlantic. They established that the slaves had been captured in [[Mendiland]] (also spelled Mendeland, current [[Sierra Leone]]) in Africa, sold to a Portuguese trader in [[Lomboko]] (south of [[Freetown]]) in April 1839, and taken to [[Havana]] illegally on a Portuguese ship. As the Africans were victims of illegal kidnapping, the abolitionists argued they were not slaves and were free to return to Africa. Their papers wrongly identified them as slaves who had been in Cuba since before 1820 (and were thus considered to have been born there as slaves). They contended that government officials in Cuba condoned such mistaken classifications.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Concerned about relations with Spain and his re-election prospects in the South, the Democratic President [[Martin Van Buren]] sided with the Spanish position. He ordered the schooner [[USS Grampus (1821)|USS ''Grampus'']] to [[New Haven Harbor]] to return the Africans to Cuba immediately after a favorable decision, before any appeals could be decided.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World|first=David Brion|last=Davis|authorlink=David Brion Davis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=18|isbn=978-0-19-514073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court ruled in favor of the abolitionist and Africans' position. In January 1840, it ordered that the Africans be returned to their homeland by the U.S. government, and that one-third of ''La Amistad'' and its cargo be given to Lieutenant Gedney as salvage property. (The federal government had outlawed the slave trade between the U.S. and other countries in 1808; an 1818 law, as amended in 1819, provided for the return of all illegally traded slaves.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}) The captain's personal slave Antonio was declared the rightful property of the captain's heirs and was ordered restored to Cuba (Sterne said that he willingly returned to Cuba.)&lt;ref&gt;''The Slave Ship'', Sterne, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2013}} [[Smithsonian]] sources say that he escaped to New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngb.si.edu Smithsonian Institution]&lt;/ref&gt; or to Canada, with the help of an abolitionist group).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In detail, the district court ruled as follows:
* It rejected the claim of the U.S. Attorney, argued on behalf of the Spanish minister, for the restoration of the slaves.&lt;ref name="amistad590"/&gt;
* It dismissed the claims of Ruiz and Montez.&lt;ref name="amistad590"/&gt;
* It ordered that the captives be delivered to the custody of the President of the United States for transportation to Africa, since they were, in fact, legally free.&lt;ref name="amistad590"/&gt;
* It allowed the Spanish vice-consul to claim the slave Antonio.&lt;ref name="amistad590"/&gt;
* It allowed Lt. Gedney to claim one-third of the property on board ''La Amistad''.&lt;ref name="amistad590"/&gt;
* It allowed Tellincas, Aspe, and Laca to claim one-third of the property.&lt;ref name="amistad590"/&gt;
* It dismissed the claims of Green and Fordham for salvage.&lt;ref name="amistad590"/&gt;

The [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] for the District of Connecticut, by order of Van Buren, immediately appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Connecticut District. He challenged every part of the district court's ruling except the concession of the slave Antonio to the Spanish vice-consul. Tellincas, Aspe, and Laca also appealed to gain a greater portion of the salvage value. Ruiz and Montez, and the owners of ''La Amistad'', did not appeal.&lt;ref name="amistad590"/&gt;

The circuit court of appeals  affirmed (upheld) the district court's decision in April 1840.&lt;ref name="amistad590"/&gt; The U.S. Attorney appealed the federal government's case to the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="amistad590"/&gt;

===Arguments before the Supreme Court===
On February 23, 1841, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Henry D. Gilpin]] began the oral argument phase before the Supreme Court. Gilpin first entered into evidence the papers of ''La Amistad,'' which stated that the Africans were Spanish property. Gilpin argued that the Court had no authority to rule against the validity of the documents. Gilpin contended that if the Africans were slaves (as evidenced by the documents), then they must be returned to their rightful owner, in this case, the Spanish government. Gilpin's argument lasted two hours.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~amistad/amessays.htm Clifton Johnson, "The Amistad Case and Its Consequences in U.S. History"], Amistad Research Center – Essays, Tulane University&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Quincy Adams]], former president of the United States and at that time a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Massachusetts]], had agreed to argue for the Africans. When it was time for him to argue, he said he felt ill-prepared. [[Roger Sherman Baldwin]], who had already represented the captives in the lower cases, opened in his place.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

Baldwin, a prominent attorney, contended that the Spanish government was trying to manipulate the Court to return "fugitives". He argued that the Spanish government sought the return of slaves who had been freed by the district court; but the Spanish government was not appealing the fact of their having been freed. Covering all the facts of the case, Baldwin spoke for four hours over the course of February 22 and 23.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;&lt;!--the 22nd is BEFORE Gilpin "began the oral argument".  How could the second speaker begin earlier?--&gt; (He was of no relation to [[Henry Baldwin (judge)|Justice Baldwin]] of the Court.)

John Quincy Adams rose to speak on February 24. He reminded the court that it was a part of the [[Judiciary|judicial branch]] and not part of the executive. Introducing copies of correspondence between the Spanish government and the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], he criticized President [[Martin Van Buren]] for his assumption of [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] powers in the case:&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

{{quote|This review of all the proceedings of the Executive I have made with utmost pain, because it was necessary to bring it fully before your Honors, to show that the course of that department had been dictated, throughout, not by justice but by sympathy – and a sympathy the most partial and injust. And this sympathy prevailed to such a degree, among all the persons concerned in this business, as to have perverted their minds with regard to all the most sacred principles of law and right, on which the liberties of the United States are founded; and a course was pursued, from the beginning to the end, which was not only an outrage upon the persons whose lives and liberties were at stake, but hostile to the power and independence of the judiciary itself.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;}}

Adams argued that neither [[Pinckney's Treaty]] nor the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] were applicable to the case. Article IX of Pinckney's Treaty referred only to property, and did not apply to people. As to ''[[The Antelope]]'' decision (10 Wheat. 124), which recognized "that possession on board of a vessel was evidence of property",&lt;ref&gt;''Supra'' note 1 at 545.&lt;!--?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Adams said that did not apply either, since the precedent was established prior to the prohibition of the foreign slave trade by the United States. Adams concluded on March 1 after eight and one-half hours of speaking. (The Court had taken a recess following the death of [[Associate Justice]] [[Philip Pendleton Barbour|Barbour]]).&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

Attorney General Gilpin concluded oral argument with a three-hour rebuttal on March 2.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;  The Court retired to consider the case.

===Supreme Court===
On March 9, Associate Justice [[Joseph Story]] delivered the Court's decision. Article IX of [[Pinckney's Treaty]] was ruled off topic since the Africans in question were never legal property. They were not criminals, as the U.S. Attorney's Office argued, but rather "unlawfully kidnapped, and forcibly and wrongfully carried on board a certain vessel".&lt;ref&gt;''US v. The Amistad'', p. 588&lt;/ref&gt; The documents submitted by Attorney General Gilpin were not evidence of property, but rather of fraud on the part of the Spanish government. Lt. Gedney and the USS ''Washington'' were to be awarded salvage from the vessel for having performed "a highly meritorious and useful service to the proprietors of the ship and cargo".&lt;ref name="amistad597"&gt;''US v. The Amistad'', p. 597&lt;/ref&gt; When ''La Amistad'' came into Long Island, however, the Court believed it to be in the possession of the Africans on board, who had never intended to become slaves. Therefore, the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] did not apply, and the President was not required to return the Africans to Africa.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

In his judgment, Story wrote:

{{Quote|[[File:Daguerreotype of Joseph Story, 1844 (edit).jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph Story]] gave the Supreme Court's majority judgment.]]
It is also a most important consideration, in the present case, which ought not to be lost sight of, that, supposing these African negroes not to be slaves, but kidnapped, and free negroes, the treaty with Spain cannot be obligatory upon them; and the United States are bound to respect their rights as much as those of Spanish subjects. The conflict of rights between the parties, under such circumstances, becomes positive and inevitable, and must be decided upon the eternal principles of justice and international law. If the contest were about any goods on board of this ship, to which American citizens asserted a title, which was denied by the Spanish claimants, there could be no doubt of the right to such American citizens to litigate their claims before any competent American tribunal, notwithstanding the treaty with Spain. A fortiori, the doctrine must apply, where human life and human liberty are in issue, and constitute the very essence of the controversy. The treaty with Spain never could have intended to take away the equal rights of all foreigners, who should contest ther claims before any of our courts, to equal justice; or to deprive such foreigners of the protection given them by other treaties, or by the general law of nations. Upon the merits of the case, then, there does not seem to us to be any ground for doubt, that these negroes ought to be deemed free; and that the Spanish treaty interposes no obstacle to the just assertion of their rights. ...

When the Amistad arrived, she was in possession of the negroes, asserting their freedom; and in no sense could they possibly intend to import themselves here, as slaves, or for sale as slaves. In this view of the matter, that part of the decree of the district court is unmaintainable, and must be reversed.

The view which has been thus taken of this case, upon the merits, under the first point, renders it wholly unnecessary for us to give any opinion upon the other point, as to the right of the United States to intervene in this case in the manner already stated. We dismiss this, therefore, as well as several minor points made at the argument. ...

Upon the whole, our opinion is, that the decree of the circuit court, affirming that of the district court, ought to be affirmed, except so far as it directs the negroes to be delivered to the president, to be transported to Africa, in pursuance of the act of the 3rd of March 1819; and as to this, it ought to be reversed: and that the said negroes be declared to be free, and be dismissed from the custody of the court, and go without delay.&lt;ref name="amistad597"/&gt;}}

==Aftermath and significance==
[[File:Kimbo Amistad 1839 1840.jpg|thumb|right|[[Portrait]] of Kimbo, one of 36 men aboard ''La Amistad'', c. 1839–1840]]
The Africans greeted the news of the Supreme Court's decision with joy. Abolitionist supporters took the survivors – 36 men and boys and three girls – to [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]], a village considered "Grand Central Station" on the [[Underground Railroad]]. Their residents had agreed to have the Africans stay there until they could return to their homeland. Some households took them in; supporters also provided barracks for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.charteroaktree.com/farmingtonamistadtour.html | accessdate=September 20, 2010 | title=Underground Railroad, Black History Freedom Trail and Amistad Sites Tour in Farmington | publisher=Heritage Trails Sightseeing Tours | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925013335/http://www.charteroaktree.com/farmingtonamistadtour.html | archive-date=September 25, 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.farmingtonhistoricalsociety-ct.org/fh_farmhist_pg4.html | publisher=Farmington Historical Society | accessdate=September 20, 2010 | title=History of Farmington}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Underground Railroad stops mark abolitionist milestones | date=February 7, 2010 | url=http://www.boston.com/travel/explorene/articles/2010/02/07/underground_railroad_stops_mark_abolitionist_milestones/?page=2 | first=Christopher | last=Klein |work=Boston Globe | accessdate=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amistad Committee instructed the Africans in English and Christianity, and raised funds to pay for their return home. Along with several [[missionaries]], in 1842 the surviving 39 Africans sailed to Sierra Leone. The Americans constructed a mission in [[Mendiland]]. Numerous members of the Amistad Committee later founded the [[American Missionary Association]], an evangelical organization which continued to support the Mendi mission. With leadership of black and white ministers from mostly Presbyterian and Congregational denominations, it was active in working for abolitionism in the United States and for the education of Blacks, sponsoring the founding of [[Howard University]], among other institutions.  After the [[American Civil War]], it founded numerous schools and colleges for [[freedmen]] in the South.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In the following years, the Spanish government continued to press the US for compensation for the ship, cargo and slaves.  Several southern lawmakers introduced resolutions into the [[United States Congress]] to appropriate money for such payment but failed to gain passage, although it was supported by Democratic presidents [[James K. Polk]] and [[James Buchanan]].

[[Joseph Cinqué]] returned to Africa. In his final years, he was reported to have returned to the mission and re-embraced Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amistad.mysticseaport.org/discovery/people/bio.cinque.html|title="Cinque (Sengbe Pieh)", ''Exploring Amistad at Mystic Seaport''|accessdate=November 7, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117085126/http://amistad.mysticseaport.org/discovery/people/bio.cinque.html|archivedate=November 17, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent historical research suggests that the allegations of Cinqué's later involvement in the slave trade are false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.common-place-archives.org/vol-10/no-01/yannielli/ Joseph Yannielli, "Cinqué the Slave Trader: Some New Evidence on an Old Controversy," ''Common-Place'', Vol. 10 (October 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Creole case|''Creole'' case]] of 1841, the United States dealt with another ship rebellion similar to that of the ''Amistad.''

'''Via Colori''' is a [[street painting]] festival held throughout the United States to raise funds for not-for-profit organizations. Hundreds of artists gather and create large-scale artworks on the street using chalk, and each artist is usually sponsored by a business or individual. After expenses, the money raised goes to the not-for-profit organization to help further its mission.

Via Colori is founded on a spirit of cooperation, not competitiveness, as a collected expression of artists working together to support a cause.

==History==
Street painting was first recorded in Italy in the 16th Century when artists would paint religious icons in the courtyards of cathedrals. Known as "madonnari", these artists were "the visual arts counterpart of minstrels", and would most commonly paint icons of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna.]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurtwenner.com/artist.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Street painting festivals are now held throughout the world.

In 1994, Via Colori was founded by author, playwright and performer Rick Compton in Naples, Florida. Now raising hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for not-for-profits, it has continued to grow since that time. Via Colori is owned, supported and licensed by Compton and is licensable by any not-for-profit with a widely-supported mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viacolori.com/history.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
Festivals are currently (2010) held in the following cities: Houston, Texas; Elizabethtown, Kentucky; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Glendale, Arizona; Sandestin, Florida; and Fredericksburg, Virginia. They are hosted by "beneficiary hosts", [[501(c)(3)]] organizations that license Via Colori and coordinates the festival to further its mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viacolori.com/thebeneficiaryhosts.asp&lt;/ref&gt; In Houston, for example, The Center for Hearing and Speech is the beneficiary host.

==Artists==
From the ranks of the hundred or so volunteer artists who draw in each Via Colori, one is  featured. This featured artist usually creates a larger square, and might be well known in the street painting world.

Other artists may be full-time professional artists as well as "talented hobbyists" and "art enthusiasts". Families occasionally paint squares together, or a group of high school students under the supervision of their art teacher will team up.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viacolori.com/theartists.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

An explanation of this phrase is that it must be the second-oldest profession because it is mentioned in the [[Book of Joshua]].

: "[[Joshua son of Nun]] sent two spies out from [[Abila (Peraea)|Shittim]] secretly with orders to reconnoitre the country. The two men came to [[Jericho]] and went to the house of a prostitute named [[Rahab]]..."

[[Paul Reynolds (BBC journalist)|Paul Reynolds]], a writer with the ''[[BBC]]'', noted: ''"Rahab, of course, was engaged in [[prostitution|the oldest profession]]."''

[[Ronald Reagan]] nominated [[politician]] as the second-oldest profession with the alleged quip, ''"Someone once said that politics is the second-oldest profession. I'm beginning to think it bears resemblance to the first."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jan Hanska | title=Reagan’s Mythical America: Storytelling as Political Leadership |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=homr1igtzBkC&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=reagan%20politics%20%22second%20oldest%20profession%22&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q=reagan%20politics%20%22second%20oldest%20profession%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Almanac]] website, nominations for the second-oldest profession include: actors, casino gambling, [[con men]], [[Gangster]]s, counterfeiting, [[gigolo]]s, [[glassmaking]], [[interpreter]]s, [[journalism]], moving companies, [[pharmacist]]s, [[pickpocket]]ing, [[pimp]]ery, [[piracy]], [[press agent]]s, [[prostitute]]s, [[spying]], and [[quackery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinitz|first=Andrew|title=The Second Oldest Profession?|url=http://www.worldalmanac.com/blog/2007/11/the_second_oldest_profession.html|work=World Almanac|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humorist [[Erma Bombeck]] titled one of her books ''Motherhood: The Second Oldest Profession'', since presumably many prostitutes (the "oldest profession") got pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/569043.Motherhood&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers write about other professions as the world's second-oldest profession without stating why they should be considered the second-oldest profession.&lt;ref&gt;
