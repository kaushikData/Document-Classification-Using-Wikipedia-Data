      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1649">[[Image:Monumento alberto da giussano.jpg|thumb|Monument to Alberto da Giussano in [[Legnano]], [[Milan]] province]]

'''Alberto da [[Giussano]]''' was a Lombard [[legend]]ary [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] warrior during the wars of the [[Lombard League]] against [[Frederick Barbarossa]] in the 12th century.

==History==
Despite the legend, the real [[condottiero]] who took part in the battles of the Lombard League was [[Guido da Landriano]]. A tradition, probably fabricated by 14th century [[Milan]]ese chroniclers, attributes Alberto the deed of forming the "[[Company of Death]]" that defended the ''[[Carroccio]]'' of the League at the [[Battle of Legnano]]. The first historical citation of his name is in 1196. He is thought to have been a ''notaro'' and a ''podestà''.

==Legacy==
[[Italy|Italian]] political party [[Northern League (Italy)|Lega Nord]] makes use of his myth. The electoral emblem of the party features Alberto with an image inspired by the statue of him erected at [[Legnano]] in 1900. Also the infantry brigade ''Legnano '' of the [[Italian Army]] used  the image of this statue as symbol.

==In popular culture==
In the 2009 film ''[[Barbarossa (film)|Barbarossa]]'', Alberto played by [[Raz Degan]] is featured as the protagonist.

'''Anne Kiguta''' (born 21 November 1984) is a Kenyan [[journalist]], talkshow host and [[news anchor]]. She is currently an Afternoon Drive Show host at Hot 96 FM Kenya. Kiguta has previously worked for Hope FM, [[98.4 Capital FM|Capital FM]], and [[Kenya Television Network|KTN]].

== Early life and education ==
Anne Kiguta was born in [[Nairobi]], Kenya to parents who were devoted to the Christian church and charity. She is the youngest of three daughters.&lt;ref name="nairobi-wire"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kamau |first1=Richard |title=Everything You Need To Know About Citizen TV’s Anne Kiguta Including her Pregnancy |url=http://nairobiwire.com/2016/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-citizen-tvs-anne-kiguta-including-her-pregnancy.html |website=Nairobi Wire |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mum ran a hospital ministry that would visit the sick and give them food.

She had an inclination towards [[social work]] from an early age and hoped to study law after secondary school.

Kiguta attended the St. Christopher’s Prep School before joining the Rusinga High School in Nairobi from year 8 to year 13. She attended Daystar University for her undergraduate degree in Public Relations and  Mass Media, and cleared in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Career ==
When she turned 18, her local church started a radio station. The station manager, David Makuyu, encouraged her to audition. Kiguta was offered the job, which effectively ended her pursuit of a career in law. At Hope FM she worked as a show host and producer on Plug In and the top 40 countdown. During the holidays, she [[interned]] in Hope FM's newsroom and started to anchor the news on the breakfast and mid-morning slot and then did her shows on Friday and Saturdays. She remained at Hope FM radio between 2003 and 2006. 

Kiguta later went to Capital FM to work as a Senior Anchor and reporter before breaking into television.&lt;ref&gt;http://hashtagsquare.co.ke/ann-kiguta-biography/&lt;/ref&gt; Kiguta went on to work at Royal Media Services in October 2013 as the Group Digital Manager and Senior Anchor.

She is currently at [[Citizen TV]] where she hosts Monday Night Special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tuko.co.ke/280276-citizen-tvs-anne-kiguta-moves-radio-royal-media-services-implements-programme-changes.html#280276|title=Citizen TV’s Anne Kiguta moves to radio as Royal Media Services implements programme changes|accessdate=22 August 2018|website=Tuko.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also hosts a radio show alongside Patrick Igunza on Hot 96 FM that focuses on social justice, politics and inclusion.

=== Television ===
Anne hosted [[Kenya Television Network|KTN]]'s Sunday night programming for three years and by 2012 [[Citizen TV]] was looking to strengthen its political desk for election ahead of the 2013 General Election.  She was the only woman doing hard political interviews at the time and was receiving a lot of criticism for it. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} 

She joined Citizen TV a year later as group digital manager and senior anchor and has hosted various shows including Opinion Court, Sunday Live and now Monday Special.

She co-anchored interviews on primetime alongside Njoroge Mwaura. She then began anchoring news on Sunday night at the station on a show called Checkpoint with [http://www.ku.ac.ke/schools/humanities/index.php/departments/history-political-studies/87-faculty/214-dr-edward-waswa-kisiang-ani Edward Kisiangani] which competed with Sunday Live, the rival program on Citizen TV.  

== Personal life ==
Kiguta is a mother to a daughter, 8, and a set of twins, aged 2.&lt;ref&gt;http://nairobiwire.com/2016/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-citizen-tvs-anne-kiguta-including-her-pregnancy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This article concerns the two antipopes Benedict XIV, claimants to the [[Papacy]] during the 15th century. Another [[Pope Benedict XIV]], canonically recognized as Pope, reigned in the 18th century.''

'''Benedict XIV''' was the name used by two closely related minor [[antipope]]s of the 15th century. The first, '''Bernard Garnier''' became [[antipope]] in 1424 and died c. 1429.&lt;ref&gt;John Julius Norwich, ''Absolute Monarchs: A History of the Papacy'', (Random House, 2011), 479.&lt;/ref&gt; The second, '''Jean Carrier''', became antipope c. 1430 and apparently left office, whether by death or resignation, by 1437.

Neither of these claimants was supported by more than a very small faction within the Church. They claimed to be the successors to [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], one of the parties to the great [[Papal Schism]]. In 1417, the [[Council of Constance]] resolved the Schism, proclaiming [[Martin V]] the new Pope and demanding that Benedict XIII renounce his claim. Benedict XIII, however, remained at a castle in [[Peñíscola]] ([[kingdom of Valencia]]) and continued to maintain supporters. He died in 1423, but, the day before his death, he created four cardinals loyal to him, in order to ensure the Avignon line. Three of these cardinals met and elected [[Antipope Clement VIII]]. However, one of Benedict XIII's cardinals, Jean Carrier, disputed the validity of this election. Carrier, acting as the [[College of Cardinals]] by himself, elected Bernard Garnier, who took the name Pope Benedict XIV, instead.&lt;ref&gt;John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier was the archdeacon of [[Rodez]], near [[Toulouse]], and Garnier had been the [[sacristan]] of Rodez.

Garnier conducted his office secretly and was known as the "hidden pope": a letter from the [[Count of Armagnac]] to [[Joan of Arc]] indicates that only Carrier knew Benedict XIV's location. Garnier's reign as Benedict XIV ended at his death in 1429 or 1430, although he named four of his own cardinals, one of whom was named Jean Farald.

Following Garnier's death, Jean Carrier elected himself as the new pope, and also styled himself Pope Benedict XIV.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Walsh, ''The Conclave: A Sometimes Secret and Occasionally Bloody History of Papal Elections'', (Canterbury Press, 2003), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier, however, had been captured and imprisoned by Antipope Clement VIII. Carrier finished his days in captivity in the castle of Foix.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Salembier, [https://archive.org/stream/greatschismwest00saleuoft#page/n365/mode/2up ''The Great Schism of the West''], (Keegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., 1907), 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[Antipopes in fiction|Some imagine]] that cardinals loyal to him elected a series of increasingly marginal antipopes in 1437 and 1470. For instance, this is the scenario in the 1995 novel ''[[l'Anneau du pêcheur]]'' by the French writer [[Jean Raspail]].&lt;ref&gt;''L'Anneau du pêcheur'', Paris : Albin Michel, 1994. 403 p. {{ISBN|2-226-07590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isabella Augusta, Lady Gregory''' (''née'' '''Persse'''; 15 March 1852 – 22 May 1932&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Augusta, Lady Gregory |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Augusta-Lady-Gregory |accessdate=2018-03-13 |date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Irish [[dramatist]], [[Folklore|folklorist]] and theatre manager. With [[William Butler Yeats]] and [[Edward Martyn]], she co-founded the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] and the [[Abbey Theatre]], and wrote numerous short works for both companies. Lady Gregory produced a number of books of retellings of stories taken from [[Irish mythology]]. Born into a class that identified closely with British rule, she turned against it. Her conversion to cultural nationalism, as evidenced by her writings, was emblematic of many of the political struggles to occur in Ireland during her lifetime.

Lady Gregory is mainly remembered for her work behind the [[Irish Literary Revival]]. Her home at [[Coole Park]] in [[County Galway]] served as an important meeting place for leading Revival figures, and her early work as a member of the board of the Abbey was at least as important as her creative writings for that theatre's development. Lady Gregory's motto was taken from [[Aristotle]]: "To think like a wise man, but to express oneself like the common people.".{{sfn|Yeats|2002|p=391}}

==Biography==
===Early life and marriage===
Gregory was born at Roxborough, [[County Galway]], the youngest daughter of the [[Anglo-Irish]] gentry family Persse. Her mother, Frances Barry, was related to [[Standish O'Grady, 1st Viscount Guillamore|Viscount Guillamore]], and her family home, Roxborough, was a 6,000-acre (24&amp;nbsp;km²) estate located between [[Gort]] and [[Loughrea]], the main house of which was later burnt down during the [[Irish Civil War]].{{sfn|Foster|2003|p=484}} She was educated at home, and her future career was strongly influenced by the family nurse (i.e. [[nanny]]), Mary Sheridan, a Catholic and a [[Irish language|native Irish speaker]], who introduced the young Augusta to the history and legends of the local area.{{sfn|Shrank|Demastes|1997|p=108}}

She married [[William Henry Gregory|Sir William Henry Gregory]], a widower with an estate at [[Coole Park]], near Gort, on 4 March 1880 in St Matthias' Church, Dublin.{{sfn|Coxhead|1961|p= 22}} Sir William, who was 35 years her elder, had just retired from his position as Governor of [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka), having previously served several terms as Member of Parliament for County Galway. He was a well-educated man with many literary and artistic interests, and the house at Coole Park housed a large library and extensive art collection, both of which Lady Gregory was eager to explore. He also had a house in London, where the couple spent a considerable amount of time, holding weekly [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] frequented by many leading literary and artistic figures of the day, including [[Robert Browning]], [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]], [[John Everett Millais]] and [[Henry James]]. Their only child, [[Robert Gregory (cricketer)|Robert Gregory]], was born in 1881. He was killed during the [[World War I|First World War]] while serving as a pilot, an event which inspired [[W. B. Yeats]]'s poems "An Irish Airman Foresees His Death", "In Memory of Major Robert Gregory" and "Shepherd and Goatherd".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/20century/topic_1_05/wbyeats_irish.htm "Representing the Great War: Texts and Contexts"], The Norton Anthology of English Literature, 8th edition, accessed 5 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kermode|1957|p=31}}

===Early writings===
The Gregorys travelled in Ceylon, India, Spain, Italy and Egypt. While in Egypt, Lady Gregory had an affair with the English poet [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt]], during which she wrote a series of love poems, ''A Woman's Sonnets''.{{sfn|Hennessy|2005}}{{sfn|Holmes|2005|p=103}}

Her earliest work to appear under her own name was ''Arabi and His Household'' (1882), a pamphlet—originally a letter to ''[[The Times]]''—in support of [[Ahmed 'Urabi|Ahmed Orabi Pasha]], leader of what has come to be known as the [[Urabi Revolt]], an 1879 Egyptian nationalist revolt against the oppressive regime of the [[Khedive]] and the European domination of Egypt. She later said of this booklet, "whatever political indignation or energy was born with me may have run its course in that Egyptian year and worn itself out".{{sfn|Gregory|1976|p=54}} Despite this, in 1893 she published ''A Phantom's Pilgrimage, or Home Ruin'', an anti-Nationalist pamphlet against [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s proposed second [[Home Rule]] Act.{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|2000|p=109}}

She continued to write prose during the period of her marriage. During the winter of 1883, whilst her husband was in Ceylon, she worked on a series of memoirs of her childhood home, with a view to publishing them under the title ''An Emigrant's Notebook'',{{sfn|Garrigan Mattar|2004|p=187}} but this plan was abandoned. She wrote a series of pamphlets in 1887 called ''Over the River'', in which she appealed for funds for the parish of St. Stephens in [[Southwark]], south London.{{sfn|Yeats|2005|loc= p. 165, fn 2}} She also wrote a number of short stories in the years 1890 and 1891, although these also never appeared in print. A number of unpublished poems from this period have also survived. When Sir William Gregory died in March 1892, Lady Gregory went into mourning and returned to Coole Park; there she edited her husband's autobiography, which she published in 1894.{{sfn|Gonzalez|1997|p=98}} She was to write later, "If I had not married I should not have learned the quick enrichment of sentences that one gets in conversation; had I not been widowed I should not have found the detachment of mind, the leisure for observation necessary to give insight into character, to express and interpret it. Loneliness made me rich—'full', as Bacon says.".{{sfn|Owens|Radner| 1990|p=12}}

===Cultural nationalism===
A trip to [[Inisheer]] in the [[Aran Islands]] in 1893 re-awoke for Lady Gregory an interest in the Irish language&lt;ref name="IWO"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041119094612/http://www.irishwriters-online.com/ladygregory.html Lady Gregory]". Irish Writers Online, accessed 23 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the folklore of the area in which she lived. She organised Irish lessons at the school at Coole, and began collecting tales from the area around her home, especially from the residents of Gort [[workhouse]]. One of the tutors she employed was [[Norma Borthwick]], who would visit Coole numerous times.&lt;ref name=Rouse&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rouse|first1=Paul|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=Borthwick, Mariella Norma}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity led to the publication of a number of volumes of folk material, including ''A Book of Saints and Wonders'' (1906), ''The Kiltartan History Book'' (1909) and ''The Kiltartan Wonder Book'' (1910). She also produced a number of collections of "Kiltartanese" versions of Irish myths, including ''[[Cuchulain of Muirthemne]]'' (1902) and ''Gods and Fighting Men'' (1904). ("Kiltartanese" is Lady Gregory's term for English with Gaelic syntax, based on the dialect spoken in [[Kiltartan]].) In his introduction to the former, Yeats wrote "I think this book is the best that has come out of Ireland in my time.".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last = Love | first = Damian | title = Sailing to Ithaca: Remaking Yeats in Ulysses| journal = The Cambridge Quarterly | volume =36 | number = 1 | year = 2007 | pages = 1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Joyce]] was to parody this claim in the [[Scylla and Charybdis]] chapter of his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.{{sfn|Emerson Rogers|1948|pages=306–327}}&lt;!--Can't find a ref for this: [[Flann O'Brien]] would also parody the book in his ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'' with his overly literal versions of the myths of the [[Irish mythology#Fenian cycle|Fenian cycle]].--&gt;

Towards the end of 1894, encouraged by the positive reception of the editing of her husband's autobiography, Lady Gregory turned her attention to another editorial project. She decided to prepare selections from Sir William Gregory's grandfather's correspondence for publication as ''Mr Gregory's Letter-Box 1813–30'' (1898). This entailed her researching Irish history of the period; one outcome of this work was a shift in her political position, from the "soft" [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionism]] of her earlier writing on Home Rule to a definite support of [[Irish nationalism]] and [[Irish Republicanism|Republicanism]], and to what she was later to describe as "a dislike and distrust of England".{{sfn|Komesu|Sekine|1990|p=102}}

===Founding of the Abbey===

[[Edward Martyn]] was a neighbour of Lady Gregory, and it was during a visit to his home, Tullira Castle, in 1896 that she first met W. B. Yeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last = Graham |first = Rigby | title = Letter from Dublin | journal =  American Notes &amp; Queries | volume = 10 | year =  1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions between the three of them, over the following year or so, led to the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp= 486, 662}} Lady Gregory undertook fundraising, and the first programme consisted of Martyn's ''The Heather Field'' and Yeats's ''[[The Countess Cathleen]]''.

The Irish Literary Theatre project lasted until 1901,{{sfn|Kavanagh|1950}} when it collapsed owing to lack of funding. In 1904, Lady Gregory, Martyn, Yeats, [[John Millington Synge]], [[George William Russell|Æ]], [[Annie Horniman]] and [[William Fay|William]] and [[Frank Fay (Irish actor)|Frank Fay]] came together to form the [[Irish National Theatre Society]]. The first performances staged by the society took place in a building called the Molesworth Hall. When the [[Mechanics' Theatre|Hibernian Theatre of Varieties]] in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in [[Marlborough Street, Dublin|Marlborough Street]] became available, Horniman and William Fay agreed to their purchase and refitting to meet the needs of the society.{{sfn|McCormack|1999|pp=5–6}}

On 11 May 1904, the society formally accepted Horniman's offer of the use of the building. As Horniman was not normally resident in Ireland, the Royal [[Letters patent|Letters Patent]] required were paid for by her but granted in the name of Lady Gregory.{{sfn|Yeats|2005|p=902}} One of her own plays, ''[[Spreading the News]]'', was performed on the opening night, 27 December 1904.{{sfn|Murray|2008 }} At the opening of Synge's ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'' in January 1907, a significant portion of the crowd rioted, causing the remainder of the performances to be acted out in [[dumbshow]].{{sfn|Ellis|2003}} Lady Gregory did not think as highly of the play as Yeats did, but she defended Synge as a matter of principle. Her view of the affair is summed up in a letter to Yeats where she wrote of the riots: "It is the old battle, between those who use a toothbrush and those who don't."{{sfn|Frazier|2002}}

===Later career===
[[Image:Lady gregory1.jpg|left|thumbnail|upright|alt=Print of a woman and a dog on a leash. Underneath is "The WHITE COCKADE. A Comedy in Three Acts, by Lady Gregory, being Volume VIII. of the Abbey Theatre Series."|The cover of Lady Gregory's 1905 play]]
Lady Gregory remained an active director of the theatre until ill-health led to her retirement in 1928. During this time she wrote more than 19 plays, mainly for production at the Abbey.&lt;ref name="IWO" /&gt; Many of these were written in an attempted transliteration of the [[Hiberno-English]] dialect spoken around Coole Park that became widely known as Kiltartanese, from the nearby village of [[Kiltartan]]. Her plays had been among the most successful at the Abbey in the earlier years,{{sfn|Pethica|2004}} but their popularity declined. Indeed, the Irish writer [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]] once wrote "the perpetual presentation of her plays nearly ruined the Abbey".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/index.htm Augusta Gregory]. Ricorso&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her plays, she wrote a two-volume study of the folklore of her native area called ''Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland'' in 1920. She also played the lead role in three performances of ''Cathleen Ni Houlihan'' in 1919.

During her time on the board of the Abbey, Coole Park remained her home; she spent her time in Dublin staying in a number of hotels. For example, at the time of the 1911 national census, she was staying in a hotel at 16 South Frederick Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/reels/nai000209724/ 1911 Census Form]&lt;/ref&gt; In these she dined frugally, often on food she had brought with her from home. She frequently used her hotel rooms to interview would-be Abbey dramatists and to entertain the company after opening nights of new plays. She spent many of her days working on her translations in the [[National Library of Ireland]]. She gained a reputation as being a somewhat conservative figure.{{sfn|DiBattista|McDiarmid|1996|p=216}} For example, when [[Denis Johnston]] submitted to the Abbey his first play, ''Shadowdance'', it was rejected by Lady Gregory and returned to the author with "The Old Lady says No" written on the title page.{{sfn|Dick|Ellmann|Kiberd|1992|p=183}} Johnston decided to rename the play, and ''The Old Lady Says 'No!' '' was eventually staged by the [[Gate Theatre]] in 1928.

===Retirement and death===
[[Image:Augusta, Lady Gregory - Project Gutenberg eText 19028.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Half length portrait of a serious elderly woman in a black Victorian dress, standing with hands clasped at her waist|Lady Gregory in later life]]
When she retired from the Abbey board, Lady Gregory returned to live in Galway, although she continued to visit Dublin regularly. The house and [[demesne]] at Coole Park had been sold to the [[Coillte Teoranta|Irish Forestry Commission]] in 1927, with Lady Gregory retaining life tenancy.{{sfn|Genet|1991|p=271}} Her Galway home had long been a focal point for the writers associated with the Irish Literary Revival, and this continued after her retirement. On a tree in what were the grounds of the house, one can still see the carved initials of Synge, Æ, Yeats and his artist brother [[Jack Yeats|Jack]], [[George A. Moore|George Moore]], [[Seán O'Casey]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Katharine Tynan]] and [[Violet Martin]]. Yeats wrote five poems about, or set in, the house and grounds: "The Wild Swans at Coole", "I walked among the seven woods of Coole", "In the Seven Woods", "Coole Park, 1929" and "Coole Park and Ballylee, 1931".

Lady Gregory, whom Shaw once described as "the greatest living Irishwoman",{{sfn|Goldsmith|1854|p=178}} died at home aged 80 from [[breast cancer]],{{sfn|Gonzalez|1997|p=98}} and is buried in the New Cemetery in [[Bohermore]], [[County Galway]]. The entire contents of Coole Park were auctioned three months after her death, and the house was demolished in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coolepark.ie/briefhistory/index.html "Brief History of Coole Park"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415065320/http://www.coolepark.ie/briefhistory/index.html |date=15 April 2013 }}, The Department of Arts, Heritage and the GAeltacht, accessed 6 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Her plays fell out of favour after her death, and are now rarely performed.{{sfn|Gordon|1970|p=28}} Many of the diaries and journals she kept for most of her adult life have been published, providing a rich source of information on Irish literary history during the first three decades of the 20th century.{{sfn|Pethica|1995}}

Her ''[[Cuchulain of Muirthemne]]'' is still considered a good retelling of the [[Ulster Cycle]] tales such as [[Deidre]], [[Cuchulainn]], and the [[Táin Bó Cúailnge]] stories. [[Thomas Kinsella]] wrote ''"I emerged with the conviction that Lady Gregory's 'Cuchulian of Muirthemne', though only a paraphrase, gave the best idea of the Ulster stories"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Thomas| last = Kinsella| title = The Tain| at = Translator's Note and Acknowledgements, p.vii | origyear =1969|year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However her version omitted some elements of the tale, usually assumed to avoid offending Victorian sensibilities, as well being an attempt as presenting a 'respectable' nation myth for the Irish, though her paraphrase is not considered dishonest.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Lady Gregory's Deirdre: Self-Censorship or Skilled Editing? | first =  Karen B. | last =  Golightly | journal = New Hibernia Review / Iris Éireannach Nua | volume =  11 | number = 1 | date = Spring 2007 | pages = 117–126 | jstor = 20558141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics find the [[bowdlerisation]]s in her works more offensive, not only the removal of references to sex and bodily functions, but also the loss of Cuchulain's "battle frenzy" (''[[Ríastrad]]''); in other areas she censored less than some of her male contemporaries, such as [[Standish James O'Grady|Standish O'Grady]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first =Patrick | last =Maume | title = Gregory, (Isabella) Augusta Lady Gregory Persse| work =  Dictionary of Irish Biography | editor-first = James|editor-last= McGuire| editor-first2 = James |editor-last2 = Quinn| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2009|  url = http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a3622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auguste Nicolas Trémont''' (31 December 1892 – 23 October 1980) was a [[Luxembourger]] [[painter]], [[sculptor]], and [[medallist]]. He specialised in [[sculpture]]s of animals, with a particular emphasis on [[big cat]]s.

==Life==
After spending his childhood in Luxembourg, Auguste Tremont moved to [[Paris]] where he enrolled at the [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|Ecole des Arts décoratifs]] in 1909. [[World War I]] caught him by surprise while he was visiting Luxembourg. As he tried to make his way back to Paris by passing through [[Switzerland]], he was arrested by German forces near the Swiss border and was imprisoned. Once released from detention, he returned to Luxembourg where he remained until the end of the war in 1918, working in a steel factory in [[Dudelange]] This work gave him the opportunity to practice his skills by drawing pictures of steel workers in action; he also befriended future [[Arbed]] president [[Aloyse Meyer]].

At the end of the war, Trémont returned to Paris where he studied at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]]. He first specialized in portraits and pictures of Paris and still life. This changed when he visited the [[Jardin des Plantes]], the [[zoological gardens]], where he found the subjects that were to become his main area of specialization: animals. Later in his life, when asked why he chose to represent animals, he replied: “because it was the most difficult task”.

In 1924, Trémont made his first [[sculptures]], and he subsequently developed his skills as a sculptor by creating animal sculptures in a variety of sizes and species. The late 1920s-early 1930s were his most productive years; it is during this period that he sculpted, in Paris, two large lions that now decorate the entrance of the [[Luxembourg City Hall]]. He spent [[World War II]] in Paris, and returned to Luxembourg at the end of the war where he created [[monuments]] for the victims of the war. He later returned to his wonderful detailed still life and oil paintings of flowers and portraits. 

Tremont's work was made available to the public through the Ruhlmann art gallery, then later Edgar Brandt and Malesherbes art galleries. His work is also represented on numerous Luxembourgian stamps.

== Major works ==

Works by Trémont adorn some of the most prominent buildings in his hometown of [[Luxembourg City]] {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, including [[Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] and [[Luxembourg City Hall]].  He also created sculptures for the Luxembourgish pavilions at the [[Exposition universelle et internationale (1935)|Brussels 1935]] and [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Paris 1937]] [[World's Fair]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4480">{{About|the Russian botanist|the AFL-CIO official|Boris Shishkin}}
'''Boris Konstantinovich Schischkin''' (born {{OldStyleDateNY|19 April|7 April}} 1886 in [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast|Kukarka]]; died 21 March 1963 in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]) was a Russian botanist and from 1943 corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]]. His name was {{lang-ru|Борис Константинович Шишкин}}, with his surname sometimes transliterated as '''Shishkin'''.

== Life and Works ==
In 1911 Schischkin graduated from the Faculty of Medicine of [[Tomsk State University]] and from 1913 to 1915 he taught there. Between 1915 and 1918 he worked as a military medical officer.

From 1918 to 1925 he headed the botanical section of the [[Simon Janashia Museum of Georgia|Caucasian Museum]] in [[Tbilisi]]. From 1925 to 1930 he was professor at the Tomsk State University, where he held a chair of [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[plant systematics]]. From 1930 he worked in the [[Komarov Botanical Institute]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] (from 1938 to 1949 as director) and from 1945 to 1958 also as professor at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad University]]. From 1946 to 1963 he was vice-president of the Botanical Society of the USSR. Shishkin's [[herbarium]] included more than thirty thousand samples, the majority of which are held in Tomsk.

His main work was concerned with the classification of flowering plants (especially from the families [[Caryophyllaceae]], [[Umbelliferae]] and [[Compositae]]) and plant geography (Siberia, Transcaucasia). He was the organizer and editor of numerous joint works, including ''The Flora of the USSR'' ({{lang-ru | Флора СССР}}), ''The Flora of the Byelorussian SSR'' ({{lang-ru | Флора БССР }}), ''the Flora of the Leningrad Oblast ('' {{lang-ru | Флора Ленинградской области}}) and ''the Flora of Turkmenistan'' ({{lang-ru | Флора Туркмении}}). He was a regional adviser for the Soviet Union on the [[Flora Europaea]] project.

Another significant works of the 1900s was 'Flora Rossiae Austro-orientalis' (1927-1936, index in 1938) by [[Boris Fedtschenko]] and Schischkin.&lt;ref&gt; David G. Frodin {{Google book|aMjXCF4rmDUC| Guide to Standard Floras of the World: An Annotated, Geographically Arranged |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honours ==
Shishkin was awarded the [[USSR State Prize]] (1952), the [[Order of Lenin]] and other medals.

He was an honorary member of the [[Société Botanique de France]] and [[Botanical Society of Washington]].

The plant genera ''[[Schischkinia]]'' &lt;span class="Person"&gt;Iljin&lt;/span&gt; (Compositae) and ''Schischkinella'' &lt;span class="Person"&gt;[[Cornelis Gijsbert Gerrit Jan van Steenis|Steenis]]&lt;/span&gt; ([[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''[[Gastrocalyx]]''; Caryophyllaceae) were named in his honour. Additionally, a number of species use ''schischkinii'' as specific epithet.

'''Brian Behlendorf''' (born March 30, 1973) is a technologist, executive, computer programmer and leading figure in the [[Open-source software|open-source]] software movement. He was a primary developer of the [[Apache HTTP server|Apache Web server]], the most popular [[web server]] software on the [[Internet]], and a founding member of the Apache Group, which later became the [[Apache Software Foundation]]. Behlendorf served as president of the foundation for three years.&lt;ref name=HyperrealHistory/&gt;

== Career ==
Behlendorf, raised in Southern California, became interested in the development of the Internet while he was a student at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in the early 1990s. One of his first projects was an [[electronic mailing list]] and online music resource, SFRaves, which a friend persuaded him to start in 1992.&lt;ref name="SFRaves"&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.sfraves.org/history/|title=SFRaves history|last=|first=|date=|work=|accessdate=2009-09-17|publisher=SFRaves}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Behlendorf was an early participant and technologist for the [[Burning Man]] festival, and founded a large online resource devoted to [[electronic music]] and related subcultures.&lt;ref name=HyperrealHistory&gt;

| accessdate=2009-09-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Behlendorf, Jonathan Nelson, Matthew Nelson and Cliff Skolnick co-founded [[Organic, Inc]]., the first business dedicated to building commercial web sites.&lt;ref name=Wikimania&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While developing the first online, for-profit, media project &amp;mdash; the [[HotWired]] web site for [[Wired Magazine]] &amp;mdash; in 1994, they realized that the [[NCSA HTTPd|most commonly used web server software]] at the time (developed at the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]) could not handle the user registration system that the company required. So, Behlendorf [[Patch (computing)|patched]] the open-source code to support HotWired's requirements.

It turned out that Behlendorf wasn't the only one busy patching the NCSA code at the time, so he and Cliff Skolnick put together an electronic mailing list to coordinate the work of the other programmers. By the end of February 1995, eight core contributors to the project started Apache as a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the NCSA codebase. Working loosely together, they eventually rewrote the entire original program as the [[Apache HTTP Server]]. In 1999, the project incorporated as the [[Apache Software Foundation]].

Behlendorf was the [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] of the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reinventors.net/content/brian-behlendorf/|title=Reinventors - Brian Behlendorf|work=reinventors.net|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2013/02/eff-welcomes-new-member-board-directors-brian-behlendorf|title=EFF Welcomes New Member of Board of Directors: Brian Behlendorf|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The WEF website, http://www.weforum.org/contributors/brian-behlendorf, says he was CTO of CollabNet. It does not say he was CTO of WEF --&gt;  He is also a former director and CTO of [[CollabNet]], a company he co-founded with O'Reilly &amp; Associates (now [[O'Reilly Media]]) in 1999 to develop tools for enabling collaborative distributed software development.&lt;ref name="collabnet behlendorf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collab.net/about/directors/brian_behlendorf.html | title=Brian Behlendorf (executive bio) | publisher=CollabNet | accessdate=2015-02-22 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214220824/http://www.collab.net/about/directors/brian_behlendorf.html | archivedate=2005-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; CollabNet used to be the primary corporate sponsor of the open source version control system [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]], before it became a project of the Apache Software Foundation. He continues to be involved with electronic music community events such as [[Chillits]], and speaks often at open source conferences worldwide.

In 2003, he was named to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[Technology Review]] [[TR35|TR100]] as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/tr35/?year=2003 |title=2003 Young Innovators Under 35 |publisher=[[Technology Review]] | year=2003 | accessdate=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behlendorf was a managing director at Mithril Capital, a global technology investment firm based in San Francisco, from 2014 until he joined the [[Linux Foundation]]. In 2016, he was appointed executive director of the open source [[Hyperledger]] project at the [[Linux Foundation]] to advance [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hyperledger.org/news/announcement/2016/05/founder-apache-software-foundation-joins-linux-foundation-lead-hyperledger |title=Founder of the Apache Software Foundation Joins Linux Foundation to Lead Hyperledger Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610162631/https://www.hyperledger.org/news/announcement/2016/05/founder-apache-software-foundation-joins-linux-foundation-lead-hyperledger |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C. G. Somiah''' was a former [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]] who was known for his honesty and for his impeccable career record. He wrote a best-seller autobiography 'The honest always stand alone'.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|title=Former CAG C G Somaiah passes away|url=http://www.mangalorean.com/specials/specialnews.php?newsid=197397&amp;newstype=local|work=Mangalorean.com|publisher=Mangalore Media Company|accessdate=3 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103184935/http://www.mangalorean.com/specials/specialnews.php?newsid=197397&amp;newstype=local|archivedate=3 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a long career as an [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]] officer first in the state of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and next in five central ministries (defense, finance, company affairs, planning and home affairs) of [[India]].&lt;ref name="confident"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhattacharya|first=A K|title=The confidential bureaucrat|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/the-confidential-bureaucrat-110090900070_1.html|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Business Standard|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Codanda G Somiah was born on 11 March 1931 as the son of a forest officer who belonged to a family of [[Kodavas]] from [[Madikeri]] in [[Kodagu]].&lt;ref name="firm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anand|first=V.

He then served as a faculty member of that college briefly before he cleared the [[Indian Administrative Service]] examination and joined the service in 1953. He was then made part of the [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] state cadre. He won the South India Junior Tennis Championship and the All Orissa Badminton Championship in 1956.&lt;ref name="rmaf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103202032/http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} CAG of India.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orissa cadre==

Somiah was first posted as assistant commissioner in Orissa. As Collector and Deputy Commissioner at Mayurbhanj in Orissa, Somiah was known for his brilliant sense of humour, his witty remarks and for not losing his cool.&lt;ref name="firm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anand|first=V. Eshwar|title=He stood firm against pressure|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100919/spectrum/book4.htm|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Tribune, India|date=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Orissa as State Forest Secretary, he took a principled stand against granting concessions to contractors of the ''Kendu'' leaf (a minor forest produce used for wrapping beedis) commodity. It was in 1967 when Maharaja [[Rajendra Narayan Singh Deo|R. N. Singh Deo]] was the [[Chief Minister]] of Orissa. He had wanted Somiah to grant relief to Kendu leaf contractors on grounds of a poor crop that year. But Somiah refused by stating that the contractors had made enormous profits the previous years.&lt;ref name="firm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anand|first=V. Eshwar|title=He stood firm against pressure|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100919/spectrum/book4.htm|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Tribune, India|date=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not agree to reduce or remit the lease-rent as demanded by Kendu leaf contractors as he found their plea of crop failure baseless.&lt;ref name="loner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Padmanabhan|first=A. S.|title=A lucky loner in the corridors of power|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/a-lucky-loner-in-the-corridors-of-power/article590514.ece|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, Somiah had ignored the politically motivated suggestions by the ruling party and did what he thought was right. This vexed the C. M. who later made 'adverse remarks' in Somiah's performance assessment record. Somiah was later transferred to [[Cuttack]] where he was made Excise Commissioner.&lt;ref name="loner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Padmanabhan|first=A. S.|title=A lucky loner in the corridors of power|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/a-lucky-loner-in-the-corridors-of-power/article590514.ece|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in having to wait for two years for his name to be cleared of the unnecessary blemish.&lt;ref name="confident"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhattacharya|first=A K|title=The confidential bureaucrat|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/the-confidential-bureaucrat-110090900070_1.html|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Business Standard|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contractors had their way and Somiah's promotion was delayed.&lt;ref name="loner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Padmanabhan|first=A. S.|title=A lucky loner in the corridors of power|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/a-lucky-loner-in-the-corridors-of-power/article590514.ece|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somiah's successor complied with Deo and the contractors were given money grants. This blew up into a huge corruption case and Deo's government was toppled. Somiah fought against the 'adverse remarks' made by the 'vengeful' C.M. With the change of guard a commission was appointed to enquire into the Kendu leaf 'scandal' and its report vindicated his position.&lt;ref name="loner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Padmanabhan|first=A. S.|title=A lucky loner in the corridors of power|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/a-lucky-loner-in-the-corridors-of-power/article590514.ece|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Mitter Commission, appointed by the later Congress government, indicted the previous government in granting 'unwarranted and mala fide' relief.&lt;ref name="firm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anand|first=V.

S.|title=A lucky loner in the corridors of power|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/a-lucky-loner-in-the-corridors-of-power/article590514.ece|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus his struggle against the politician-contractor nexus on tendu leaves ended with him partly winning.&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopalakrishnan|first=R|title=On The Half-Tones of Truth|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?266450|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Outlook India|date=9 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103220624/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?266450|archivedate=3 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sabbatical==

Somiah was awarded the [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] Fellowship and did his sabbatical at the [[Oxford University]] in 1974–1975.&lt;ref name="rmaf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103202032/http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} CAG of India.&lt;/ref&gt; Somiah declined an offer to join the [[Indian Foreign Service]].&lt;ref name="confident"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhattacharya|first=A K|title=The confidential bureaucrat|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/the-confidential-bureaucrat-110090900070_1.html|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Business Standard|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Emergency==

During the Emergency in 1975–1977, he cleared the names of officers and political leaders who were wrongly booked under various offences and were to be subjected to unlawful detentions. He declared to his secretary M L Khurana that it was important for the bureaucracy to apply its mind before taking a decision (based on the words of political leaders).&lt;ref name="confident"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhattacharya|first=A K|title=The confidential bureaucrat|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/the-confidential-bureaucrat-110090900070_1.html|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Business Standard|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Union Government==

Somiah was deputed to the Central Government in New Delhi where he had an uninterrupted 15-year stint in various ''Bhavans'' (Government houses and offices) on Raisina Hill until 1996.&lt;ref name="confident"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhattacharya|first=A K|title=The confidential bureaucrat|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/the-confidential-bureaucrat-110090900070_1.html|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Business Standard|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somiah worked in association with luminaries such as [[Nanabhoy Palkhivala|Nani Palkivala]] and [[Ashoke Sen|Ashoke Kumar Sen]]. Once [[Dhirubhai Ambani]] tried to test his integrity by offering him some shares in [[Reliance Industries|Reliance]] out of the promoter's quota. Somiah bluntly refused him.&lt;ref name="firm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anand|first=V. Eshwar|title=He stood firm against pressure|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100919/spectrum/book4.htm|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Tribune, India|date=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the financial controller of the Asian Games Organising committee in the 1982 Asian Games held in New Delhi.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|title=Former CAG C G Somaiah passes away|url=http://www.mangalorean.com/specials/specialnews.php?newsid=197397&amp;newstype=local|work=Mangalorean.com|publisher=Mangalore Media Company|accessdate=3 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103184935/http://www.mangalorean.com/specials/specialnews.php?newsid=197397&amp;newstype=local|archivedate=3 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 he was appointed Secretary Department of Company Affairs and Chairman of the [[Company Law Board]].&lt;ref name="rmaf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103202032/http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} CAG of India.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he had a stint in the department of Company Affairs, the exemption limit under the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act was raised. So accordingly, when Somiah later became the Home Secretary he found his office room was bugged. He summoned the individual responsible for this and chastised him.&lt;ref name="loner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Padmanabhan|first=A. S.|title=A lucky loner in the corridors of power|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/a-lucky-loner-in-the-corridors-of-power/article590514.ece|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later when India purchased Czech pistols, Somiah found them to be defective. He worked through the diplomatic channels and got the price refunded from the foreign seller. But he was unnecessarily suspected and a probe was instituted after which he was found to be innocent.&lt;ref name="loner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Padmanabhan|first=A. S.|title=A lucky loner in the corridors of power|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/a-lucky-loner-in-the-corridors-of-power/article590514.ece|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=The Hindu|date=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planning Commission===

He was made Secretary of the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]] when [[Dr. Manmohan Singh]] was its chairman. He was the [[Home Secretary]] under [[Rajiv Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|title=Former CAG C G Somaiah passes away|url=http://www.mangalorean.com/specials/specialnews.php?newsid=197397&amp;newstype=local|work=Mangalorean.com|publisher=Mangalore Media Company|accessdate=3 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103184935/http://www.mangalorean.com/specials/specialnews.php?newsid=197397&amp;newstype=local|archivedate=3 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had advised the Central Government during the formulation of the Seventh [[Five-Year Plans of India|Five-Year Plan]] and in deciding the allocation of financial resources for the various State Plans.&lt;ref name="rmaf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103202032/http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} CAG of India.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home Secretary===

He was later made Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs. As Home Secretary, he led a delegation to [[Pakistan]] in 1987 to discuss [[counter terrorism]] and the control of [[narcotics]].&lt;ref name="rmaf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103202032/http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} CAG of India.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also involved in [[Operation Black Thunder]], in fighting terrorism in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and in flushing out terrorists from the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]]. He later paid a visit to the Golden Temple with his wife, to pray and to pay his respects, while his superiors supposedly overlooked the need to do so. His act helped assuage the tense situation in Amritsar.&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopalakrishnan|first=R|title=On The Half-Tones of Truth|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?266450|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Outlook India|date=9 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103220624/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?266450|archivedate=3 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also involved in controlling the disturbances that occurred in [[Darjeeling]]. He was closely involved in signing the [[Punjabis|Punjab]], Assam, [[Mizo people|Mizo]] and [[Gorkhaland]] accords.&lt;ref name="firm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anand|first=V.

G. Somiah (Central Home Secretary) on behalf of the Indian Union and Rathindranath Sengupta (Chief Secretary of West Bengal) on behalf the [[West Bengal]] State. [[Home Minister]] [[Buta Singh]] and West Bengal Chief Minister [[Jyoti Basu]] stood as witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dasgupta|first=Surajit Kumar|title=West Bengal's Jyoti Basu: A Political Profile|year=1992|publisher=Gyan Books|location=New Delhi|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7QI4eOM18cC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=somiah+gorkhaland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=65ZOviqovr&amp;sig=SHtSsHYE5RzELhcJl4R-KnNuPx8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bbrGUsrOM87_rAeg1oHoAg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=somiah%20gorkhaland&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1988, Somiah was made the [[Central Vigilance Commission]]er.

When he was part of the home ministry, he rejected the suggestion to ban the religious right of the Coorgs (Kodavas) and the people of Coorg (Kodagu) to possess guns. This religious right is similar to that of the [[Sikhs]] to hold the [[kirpans]].&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopalakrishnan|first=R|title=On The Half-Tones of Truth|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?266450|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Outlook India|date=9 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103220624/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?266450|archivedate=3 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somiah was as renowned for his modesty as he was for his uprightness. He would dine modestly with his family and drive his personal Maruthi car while not flaunting his status as home secretary. When he once missed a red signal once, he promptly paid the fine on the spot to the constable without making any fuss.&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopalakrishnan|first=R|title=On The Half-Tones of Truth|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?266450|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Outlook India|date=9 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103220624/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?266450|archivedate=3 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CAG===

He was sworn in by the [[President of India]] in 1990 to serve a six-year term as [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]] (CAG). He served as the CAG between 27 March 1990 and 11 March 1996. The CAG is ranked 9th in India according to the [[Indian order of precedence]] and has the same status as a judge of the [[Supreme Court of India]]. As CAG he headed the financial audits of the Central Government, the 26 States and 5 Union Territories of India.&lt;ref name="rmaf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103202032/http://saiindia.gov.in/english../home/about_us/history/1990-2007/Vol_1/cag_photos.pdf |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }} CAG of India.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chairman of the UN Board of Auditors===

'''Richard Davis Thunderbird''' (August 6, 1866 – April 6, 1946) was a Native American actor of [[Cheyenne]] descent known as '''Chief Thunderbird'''. He appeared in twenty films but was only credited for major films such as ''[[Wild West Days]]'' (1937), ''For the Service'' (1936), ''[[Silly Billies]]'' (1936), ''Custer's Last Stand'' (1936), ''[[Annie Oakley (1935 film)|Annie Oakley]]'' (1935), ''Cyclone of the Saddle'' (1935), ''[[Laughing Boy (film)|Laughing Boy]]'' (1934), and ''[[Heroes of the West (1932 film)|Heroes of the West]]'' (1932).

==Career==

Thunderbird was born on August 6, 1866, near [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]], [[Montana]] and attended the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School|Carlisle Indian School]].

Thunderbird made his first appearance in a film in 1914. He played an "Indian" (an uncredited role) in the film ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' 
Thunderbird got his first credited roles in the movie ''[[Heroes of the West (1932 film)|Heroes of the West]]'' where he played as Chief Thunderbird. The protagonists of the film included Noah Beery Jr., as Noah Blaine, [[Julie Bishop (actress)|Julie Bishop]] as Ann Blaine, [[Onslow Stevens]] as Tom Crosby and William Desmond as John Blaine. The film was a classic Western film in which the leading role was known for fighting off the crooks and Indians for the railroad.

Thunderbird got his first big role in his next film, ''[[Laughing Boy (film)|Laughing Boy]]'' (1934), where he played Laughing Boy's Father. The film itself was a controversial one, revolving around Ramon Novarro's character, Laughing Boy, who falls in love with Lupe Velez's character, Silly Girl. Laughing Boy's family, of Navaho descent, disapprove of their son's decision to marry a white man's mistress.

The next film Thunderbird was credited for was ''Cyclone of the Saddle'' (1935) where he starred as High Hawk. The movie itself was about how Rex Lease's character, Andy Thomas, was in charge of getting to the bottom of who was harassing the wagon trains. Thunderbird however did not have much of a commanding role in this film.

Later in 1935, Thunderbird was showcased in his most notable film ''[[Annie Oakley (1935 film)|Annie Oakley]]'' (1935), starring as Chief Sitting Bull. The film, called a "Western", takes place in [[Cincinnati]]. Thunderbird plays the character of Chief Sitting Bull, a representation of the actual [[Sitting Bull]] (1831–1890), a Native American of Sioux descent.

Thunderbird next starred in ''Custer's Last Stand'' (1936) as Rain-in-Face. (Chick Davis) however had a very minimal role in the film. The film itself was about how the villains (the Indians) were attacking white men. Blade, the main protagonist steals an Indian medicine arrow. When asked to exchange the arrow for gold, Blade decides to start killing the Indians. Although it is an abysmal role for Thunderbird, it is important to understand the representation of the Native Americans in these films at this time.

Thunderbird made his next appearance in 1936 in the film ''[[Silly Billies]]'', where he played Chief Cyclone. The two main characters travel to the West to open up a new dentist practice where they find themselves saving the day against the hostile Indians.

Thunderbird made another appearance in 1936 in the film ''For the Service'', where he played Chief Big Bear. In this film, main characters, Buck Jones ([[Buck O'Bryan]]) and Captain Murphy (Edward Keane) send their troops to go after the outlaw gang, composed of whites and Indian renegades. This film portrays Indians as killers, thieves and all around not intelligent human beings.

Thunderbird's last major credited film came in 1937, where he played Chief Red Hatchet in ''Wild West Days''. Like most Westerns of the time, Thunderbird played the side of the villain. In ''[[Wild West Days]]'' the Indians plotted alongside the Secret Seven to take over the Munro Ranch.

Thunderbird made his last appearance in 1944 in the film ''The Falcon Out West'', where he was uncredited in the role of Eagle Feather. He died two years later on April 6, 1946 in [[Los Angeles County]], [[California]], at the age of 79.

Though Thunderbird acted in twenty films, he never got a commanding role because of discrimination against his Native American race.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} During his era, Indians were portrayed as rebels, sought out to kill and rob all of the main white protagonists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2797">The emerging field of '''conflict epidemiology''' offers a more accurate method to measure deaths caused during violent conflicts or [[wars]] that can generate more reliable numbers than before to guide decision-makers.

In February 2001 the [[Carter Center]] and the [[United States Institute of Peace]] (USIP), in collaboration with [[CARE (relief)]], [[Emory University]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), sponsored a meeting on "Violence and Health". The goals of the meeting were to determine the impact of violent conflict on [[public health]] and to advise public health training programs on means to enhance the work of public health professionals in working in violent conflicts.

Compiling or estimating the numbers of deaths caused during wars and other violent conflicts is a controversial subject.  Historians often put forward many different estimates of the numbers killed during historic conflicts.  What conflict epidemiology offers is a better methodology to more accurately estimate actual mortality rates during existing wars and conflict.

As war is a leading cause of illness and death, there are those in the field of public health who argue "war epidemiology" should be a more prominent component of the field of public health.&lt;Hagopian A. Why isn't war properly framed and funded as a public health problem? Med Confl Surviv. 2017 Jun;33(2):92-100. doi: 10.1080/13623699.2017.1347848. Epub 2017 Jul 10.&gt;

==Iraq Conflict 2003==

The subject of conflict epidemiology made headline news after a report of a survey was conducted by an American and Iraqi team of public health researchers. Data were collected by local Iraqi doctors and analysed by the faculty of the [[Johns Hopkins School of Public Health]].

'''Dada Bhagwan''', also known as '''Dadashri''', born '''Ambalal Muljibhai Patel''', was a spiritual leader from [[Gujarat]], India who founded the [[Akram Vignan Movement]].

==Life==
===Early life===
Ambalal Muljibhai Patel (A. M. Patel) was born on 7 November 1908 in [[Tarsali]], a village near [[Baroda]] (now in Gujarat, India). His parents, Muljibhai and Jhaverba, were [[Vaishnava]] [[Patidar]]s. He grew up in [[Bhadran]], [[Kheda district]] in central Gujarat. A. M. Patel credited his mother for instilling an early appreciation of the values of nonviolence, empathy, selfless generosity, and spiritual penance within him. It is said that he was blessed by a saint when he was thirteen who told that he would attain liberation. He married a local village girl named Hiraba in 1924. Their children (born in 1928 and 1931) died a few months after birth so they had no surviving children. During this period, he was also influenced by the writings of [[Shrimad Rajchandra]] who was also householder and religious teacher whose teaching inspired new religious movement later. He began practicing temporary [[Brahmacharya|celibacy]] and later vowed lifelong celibacy.  He was a contractor by profession. He moved to [[Bombay]] where he worked successfully as a contractor for the company Patel &amp; Co. The company used to maintain and construct dry docks in the Bombay harbour.&lt;ref name=FPeter&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/7438/1/Present_Lord_2003.pdf|title=Present Lord: Simandhara Svami and the Akram Vijnan Movement|last=Flügel|first=Peter|work=The Intimate Other: Love Divine in the Indic Religions|publisher=Orient Longman|year=2005|isbn=9788125028017|editor-last=King|editor-first=Anna S.|location=New Delhi|pages=194–243|chapter=|format=PDF|quote=|editor-last2=Brockington|editor-first2=John|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sureshbjani.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/dada_bhagwan/|title=દાદા ભગવાન – અંબાલાલ મૂળજીભાઈ પટેલ|last=Jani|first=Suresh B.|date=2011-06-29|website=Gujarati Pratibha Parichay|language=Gujarati|trans-title=Dada Bhagwan – Ambalal Muljibhai Patel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiley2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiley|first=Kristi L.|title=The A to Z of Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cIhCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=17 June 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6337-8|pages=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada Bhagwan===
He claimed to have attained self-realisation in June 1958 at [[Surat railway station]] while sitting on a bench at platform number 3. It was about 6 pm and it lasted 48 minutes. However this was not revealed initially by him.&lt;ref name=FPeter/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After his experience, a close relative began to address him by the spiritual name of Dada (a Gujarati term for "Revered Grandfather") Bhagwan (Lord) became his spiritual name. The experience or self-realization is described as revelation or manifestation of the god within, or pure self, supreme self manifested through body; which he later called ''Dada Bhagwan''. He had differentiated between self and his empirical self as Patel and Dada Bhagwan.&lt;ref name=FPeter/&gt;

He left his business to his partners to concentrate on his spiritual goals. He continued to live on the dividends of his shares of company. He continued his householder life as his teaching did not require renunciation or asceticism.&lt;ref name=FPeter/&gt;

===Akram Vignan movement===
Dada Bhagwan formed a movement which he termed [[Akram Vignan Movement]]. Unlike the step-by-step purification according to Jain principles,  Akram Vignan promises instant salvation through the grace of [[Simandhar Swami]], for whom Dada Bhagwan serves as a medium. His followers believe that they will be reborn in two lives in Mahavideha, a mythical land described in [[Jain cosmology]] from where they can achieve [[moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]] (liberation) as they are in connection with ''Gyani'' (knower). Flügel regards the movement to be a form of Jain-Vaishnava syncretism, a development analogous to the Mahayana in Buddhism.&lt;ref name=FPeter/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiley2009"/&gt;

Initially, he had not revealed his experiences to the public but his some close relatives and friends knew it. In 1962, during a conversation with him, a person name Chandrakant Patel from [[Uganda]] experienced sudden self-realization. Such experience is described in traditional Jainism as ''kshayaka samyatva'' which is only achieved in presence of Tirthankara. Kanubhai K. Patel was the second person, who was also his business partner, who received instant knowledge in 1963 from Dada Bhagwan.&lt;ref name=FPeter/&gt;

===Expansion of movement===
Between 1962 and 1968, very few close people received "knowledge" through Dada Bhagwan. Following 1968, he bestowed "knowledge" who requested to be blessed. This is the foundation of the movement. He said that he was initially reluctant due to fear of public opinion as in case of [[Shrimad Rajchandra]] but after his visit to a [[Rishabha]] temple in [[Khambhat]] he decided to public performance of ''Gnanvidhi'', a practice to transfer of "knowledge" for self-realisation. In 1968, the first ''Gnanvidhi'' was held at [[Bombay]]. Over the years, the ''Gnanvidhi'' became more elaborate and achieved its present form in 1983. He continued to give spiritual discourses all over the world. He emphasized contact of "knower" (''jnani'') to gain knowledge over scriptural or ritual knowledge. His followers were initially spread in his hometown [[Vadodara]] and Bombay. The movement expanded in the 1960s and 1970s to southern Gujarat and Maharashtra and in Gujarati diaspora in East Africa, North America and UK. In 1983, he had reportedly around 50,000 followers.&lt;ref name=FPeter/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiley2009"/&gt;

When he died on 2 January 1988, his funeral was attended by about 60000.&lt;ref name=FPeter/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhagwan2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dada Bhagwan|title=Adjust Everywhere: Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTzBBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP10|date=2 April 2015|publisher=Dada Bhagwan Aradhana Trust|isbn=978-81-89725-00-6|pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Succession==
Jay Sachchidanand Sangh, the major organisation of Akram Vignan movement, was founded under the auspices of Dada Bhagwan in Mumbai. Khetsi Narsi Shah, head of local Dada Bhagwan Vitarag Trust, was appointed as the first ''sanghpati'', the community leader of it. He was succeeded by G. A. Shah of [[Ahmedabad]]. The organisation manages activities, community funds and supervises building activities along with the publication of books and magazine, ''Akram Vignan'' (first published in 1979). Now the organisation is led by local ''sanghpati''s in Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, London and US.&lt;ref name=FPeter/&gt;

Soon after the death of Dada Bhagwan, the movement split into two fractions. One led by Kanubhai Patel and backed by Jay Sachchidannad Sangh and other led by [[Niruben Amin]]. Niruben claimed that she was instructed and trained in ''Gnanvidhi'' by Dada Bhagwan. Niruben formed her own organisations; Dada Bhagwan Foundation Trust and Simandhar Swami Aradhana Trust in Ahmedabad and Mahavideh Foundation in Mumbai. She became a popular leader of the movement and was addressed as Niruma by her followers from 1999.&lt;ref name=FPeter/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiley2009"/&gt; After death of Niruben in 2006, she was succeeded by [[Deepakbhai Desai]].&lt;ref name="Bhagwan2015"/&gt;

Kanubhai Patel, also known as Kanudada, was close to Dada Bhagwan before 1978. He claims succession and presents a recorded tape in which he had instructed about it. He is seen as future [[Tirthankara]] by his many followers. His fraction refers their teaching of ''Akram Vignan'' as ''Vitrag Vignan''.&lt;ref name=FPeter/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiley2009"/&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2012, the [[Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]] named a stretch of road between Visat crossroads and Sabarmati crossroads as ''Pujya Dada Bhagwan Road'' and the Zundal circle as Dada Bhagwan circle.&lt;ref name="John 2012"&gt;{{cite web | last=John | first=Paul | title=The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has christened a stretch on SP Ring road and a circle after a revered saint Dada Bhagwan.

'''Alejandro María Daniel Irujo Urra''' (1862-1911) was a Spanish lawyer. In popular discourse he is known as father of [[Manuel Irujo y Ollo|Manuel Irujo Ollo]], a Basque political leader. In scholarly historiographic realm he is acknowledged mostly as defense attorney of [[Sabino Arana]] during his trials of 1896 and 1902. Politically Irujo is considered a typical case of an identity located in-between [[Carlism]] and emerging Spain's peripheral nationalisms, in this case the [[Basque nationalism|Basque one]].

==Family and youth==
[[File:Fusilamientos de Estella.jpg|thumb|left|[[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]], [[First Carlist War]]]]
Origins of the Irujo family are not clear; some claim they descended from a noble Urra family of [[Améscoa Baja|Améscoa]] in Western [[Navarre]].&lt;ref&gt;Ángel García-Sanz Marcotegui, ''La adscripción ideológica de los antepasados de Manuel Irujo Ollo'', [in:] ''Vasconia. Cuadernos de historia – geografía'' 32 (2002), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; It is certain that in the mid-18th century one branch of the Irujos&lt;ref&gt;one of them settled in Pamplona; its descandant was Daniel Irujo Armendáriz (1874-1927), in 1904-1909 serving as alcalde of Pamplona, not to be confused with Daniel Irujo Urra&lt;/ref&gt; lived in [[Tafalla]]; Daniel’s grandfather, [[Matías Irujo Pascual]] (1757-1832),&lt;ref&gt;compare ''Matías de Irujo Pascual'' entry, [in:] ''Geni'' genealogical service, available [https://www.geni.com/people/Mat%C3%ADas-de-Irujo-Pascual/6000000018579300996 here]&lt;/ref&gt; apart from having been an [[Espadrille|alpargatero]] owned some 9 ha of vineyards and 12 ha of arable land; he was rich enough to build an own house in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Angel Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui, ''Daniel Irujo Urra: 1862-1911: el carlo-nacionalismo imposible del defensor de Sabino Arana. Ensayo y testimonio'', Tafalla 1995, {{ISBN|9788476812136}}, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Married&lt;ref&gt;in 1779 to María Teresa Apastegui (1760-1826)&lt;/ref&gt; he had 11 children, born between 1780 and 1803; all except one settled on the rural economy.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear what language was spoken in the family; in the late 18th century Tafalla remained on the borderlines of [[Basque language|Basque]]-speaking zone.&lt;ref&gt;José María Esparza Zabalegui, ''Lexícografía de Tafalla'', [in:] ''Cuadernos de Etnolgía y Etnografía de Navarra'' 11/31 (1979), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest son and Daniel’s father, [[Manuel Irujo Apastegui]] (1803-1871), entered the [[Pamplona]] seminar but abandoned it&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;García-Sanz Marcotegui 2002, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and completed law in [[Zaragoza]], where he initially practiced.&lt;ref&gt;in the office of a known lawyer, Manuel Solano, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First Carlist War]] he joined the legitimists holding some admin posts in [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]]&lt;ref&gt;in 1838 he was member of Diputación Provisional Carlista for Navarre and most likely resided in Estella, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 26. Some documents of the suggest by his opponents he was considered one of the among most influential Navarrese Carlists, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and suffered some repression afterwards, when back in Tafalla.&lt;ref&gt;perhaps he spent some time on exile episod in France. Some of his Tafalla estates were expropriated, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; This did not prevent his law practice and career in local administration,&lt;ref&gt;in 1843 he was nominated by the ayntamiento to Junta de Escuelas; in the mid-1840s he served as teniente de alcade, with his older brother serving as alcalde&lt;/ref&gt; though he failed in a [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] bid.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1850 Manuel married Engracia Urra Jordan (1825-1885), daughter to an Estella official, whom he probably met during the war.&lt;ref&gt;García-Sanz Marcotegui 2002, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The couple left Tafalla – according to some accounts due to an anti-Carlist backlash suffered&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; – and moved to the bride’s house in Estella. Engaged in local business,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. until death he was president of the board of La Agrícola, in 1917 succeeded by his grandson Manuel, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel went on as lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. he representing local self-government and state in disputes against each other, which certainly helped him to learn the countryside specifics&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s elected as mayor for procedural reasons he could not assume the post,&lt;ref&gt;in 1857 he was elected to ayuntamiento but could not exercise as at the same time he was the municipal juez suplemente. In 1862 he was elected again and nominated alcalde; again he preferred retain the juez post and renounced the alcaldia, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 22, 31, 32&lt;/ref&gt; yet in 1866 he was elected to [[:es:Diputación Foral de Navarra|Navarrese Diputación Provincial]],&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; due to poor health barely serving.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel and Engracia had 5 children, born between 1850 and 1862; Daniel was the only surviving son.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the family spoke Basque or Spanish; in Estella of the time only few spoke "en vasco".&lt;ref&gt;Estella spoke Basque in the late 18th century, but in 1842 "en Estella los jovenes no hablan en vasco, solo los viejos de los pueblos cercanos conocen ya ese idioma", José María Satrustegi Zubeldia, ''El euskera en Tierra Estella'', [in:] ''Euskera'' 36/1 (1991), p. 120. In the late 19th century some Basque persisted among some people in Sierra de Urbasa and Sierra de Andia, Satrustegi 1991, pp. 121-122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
[[File:Insurrección carlista, ataque y defensa de Estella.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]], [[Third Carlist War]]]]
In historiography political antecedents of Daniel are summarized as "scarcely homogeneous".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some of his paternal uncles engaged in Tafallese [[:es:Cristino|Cristinos]] militia and ancestors of his wife were distinguished Estella [[Liberalism in Spain|Liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 50-2 García-Sanz Marcotegui 2002, pp. 34-5&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear, however, that the Carlist leaning prevailed; apart from Daniel’s father and other paternal uncles&lt;ref&gt;especially the older brother of Manuel, Matías, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 22-25&lt;/ref&gt; also his maternal uncle, Sebastián Urra Jordán, held various posts in the party and represented it in the Cortes.&lt;ref&gt;a priest since 1854, he was professor at the Pamplona seminar in the 1860s. Actively engaged in Carlist administration in Navarre during the war, he was member of Diputación Foral del Reino de Navarra. Briefly on exile, since 1884 served as a catehdral canon in León&lt;/ref&gt; As it was him appointed by late Manuel cabezalero of his children,&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Urra has contributed to their Carlist outlook.&lt;ref&gt;García-Sanz Marcotegui 2002, pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; Already as a child in [[Third Carlist War|Carlist-held Estella]] Daniel used to collect unexploded cartridges fired by the governmental troops to make sure they do not hurt the Carlists,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Vignaux, ''Manuel de Irujo: ministre de la République dans la guerre d'Espagne, 1936-1939'', Paris 1986, {{ISBN|9782701011288}}, p. 84, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; and he admitted to having "sucked" Carlism when a child.&lt;ref&gt;as he admitted later, "había yo mamado el carlismo, como también vosostros lo mamasteis", quoted after Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Education in Orduña college, managed by the Jesuits, is likely to have reinforced this stand; also during academic years in Valladolid Irujo remained in the company of Carlism-minded friends.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing is known about Irujo’s engagement either in the Carlist youth organization or in the party structures in the 1880s. However, he demonstrated particular interest in one element of the Carlist political program: restoration of traditional legal provincial establishments, the [[fueros]]. He seemed heavily influenced by his brother-in-law Estanislao Aranzadi, co-founder of [[:es:Asociación Euskara de Navarra|Asociación Euskara de Navarra]] and its daily, ''Lau-buru'';&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; politically the grouping tended to fuerismo,&lt;ref&gt;in 1883 ''Lau-Buru'' referred to Irujo as a close friend, ''Lau-Buru'' 05.06.83, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=6014029&amp;forma=&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; with return to foral regime placed as the central if not exclusive objective.&lt;ref&gt;the fueristas were hostile to Carlism; they rather considered the movement "mausoleum of the past", somewhat stuck in a millenarian format, compare ''Lau-Buru'' 17.09.86, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=6015178&amp;forma=&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from personal links and subscription to fuerista periodicals Irujo did not engage politically&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; before in 1887 he was offered a job in the [[University of Deusto|Jesuit Deusto college]].&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 57, 207&lt;/ref&gt; He assumed the chair of Procedimientos Judiciales y Práctica Forense and settled in [[Bilbao]] either that year or the following one. His focus on fueros matured into a treaty, produced at unspecified time though most likely in the mid-1890s, and intended as sort of a textbook for his Deusto disciples.&lt;ref&gt;the manual was titled ''¡Un hombre! Historia del Derecho vásco, escrita por el mismo y explicada a sus discípulos''. The text was published in 1932 by one of Irujo’s disciples. It diivded the history of the region into 3 parts: 1) prior to incorporation into Castille, 2) until 1839, and 3) after 1839. Present-day scholars considers the 1932 printout a reliable insight into Irujo’s views, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 57-9&lt;/ref&gt; It advanced a thesis that until 1839 Navarre and the [[Names of the Basque Country (in Spanish)|Vascongadas]] enjoyed the status of sovereign entities, united with the rest of peninsula mostly by means of personal union. 
[[File:HJK.146.12.JPG|thumb|160px|[[Joaquin Llorens Fernandez de Cordoba|Joaquin Llorens]]]]
In 1893 Navarre was rocked by the so-called [[:es:Gamazada|Gamazada]], opposition to a ministerial attempt to scrap remnants of the provincial fiscal autonomy. The Carlist deputy to the Cortes from Estella, [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]], in name of "nosotros, fueristas y regionalistas"&lt;ref&gt;María del Mar Larraza Micheltorena, ''La Gamazada en el contexto de la política navarra de fin de siglo'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 56/204 (1995), pp. 188-189&lt;/ref&gt; voiced against the project in the parliament, joined by another Carlist and the only non-Navarrese deputy who voted against it, [[Joaquín Lloréns Fernández de Cordoba|Joaquín Llorens]].&lt;ref&gt;Angel García-Sanz Marcotegui, ''La insurrección fuerista en 1893. Foralismo oficial vesus foralismo popular durante la Gamazada'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 49 (1988), p. 696&lt;/ref&gt; Irujo most likely remained in touch with the two; when Llorens was cheered in Estella upon return from Madrid, he delivered his triumphant addresses from the balcony of Irujo’s house.&lt;ref&gt;''El Tradicionalista'' 29.09.93, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=6012402&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the following year Irujo was in [[Castejón, Navarre|Castejón]], the first major Navarrese train station, organizing welcome of the Navarrese diputación returning from negotiations in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Gorka Fuentes Megina, ''El nacionalismo vasco en "El Eco de Navarra"'' [MA thesis Universidad Navarra], Pamplona 2013, pp. 20-21. In his article, published 9 years later and intended as homage to Arana, Irujo described the Castejon event as an exclusively nationalist affair,
García-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arana link==
[[File:Bizkaitarra, 1894ko iraila.jpg|thumb|160px|left|''[[:es:Bizkaitarra|Bizkaitarra]]'', 1894]]
When in Bilbao Irujo resumed his friendship with the Arana brothers and in 1894 he subscribed to their review ''[[:es:Bizkaitarra|Bizkaitarra]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; though he did not join the early Basque nationalist organisation, [[:eu:Euskeldun Batzokija|Euskeldun Batzokija]]. During Gamazada he introduced Arana to the Navarrese fueristas; it was also in 1894 that at one point, taken over by Arana’s harangue, he declared "I am your man, though I keep being a Carlist".&lt;ref&gt;"soy de los tuyos, peró sin dejar de ser carlista". In a nutshell, his view on Vascongadas and Navarre towards Spain was "unidad de Rey e independencia de Reino", Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 59-61&lt;/ref&gt; His relations with the Aranas got closer; when in 1895 they faced trial, charged with multiple offences related to reportedly Basque-nationalist, anti-Spanish background,&lt;ref&gt;in 1895 there were lawsuits planned against Arana, for assault on Filomena Soltura, for articles published on 21.07.95 in ''Bizkaitarra'', for his responsibility as president of Euskeldun Batzokija and for an anonymous article published on 05.09.95 (Arana refused to disclose its author), Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Irujo was initially supposed to defend [[Luis Arana]] in court.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 64-64&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was changed and in 1896 he defended Sabino Arana, freed on bail.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Irujo’s defense line was that Arana violated no law;&lt;ref&gt;Irujo’s speech (or its version) went to print in 1913 as ''Inocencia de un patriota. Notable defensa del fundador del partido nacionalista Don Sabino de Arana y Goiri ante el Tribunal por el ilustre Abogado D. Daniel de Irujo''&lt;/ref&gt; he went on to claim that his client campaigned against 1841 regulations, which he was perfectly entitled to do, apart from representing legitimate aspirations of "pueblo euskaldun", embodied in the God and Old Rights slogan.&lt;ref&gt;Elías Amézaga, ''Biografía sentimental de Sabino Arana'', Tafalla 2003, {{ISBN|9788481362725}}, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; With Irujo fully successful, Arana was absolved.&lt;ref&gt;Fuentes Megina 2013, pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1890s Irujo and the Aranas got even closer. In 1897 Irujo was asked to review ''El Partido Carlista y los Fueros Vasko-Nabarros'', a pamphlet written by Arana and denouncing the Carlist vision as "plain regionalism".&lt;ref&gt;detailed discussion in José Ignacio Fínez García, ''Fuerismo tradicionalista y nacionalismo vasco'' [MA thesis Universidad de Salamanca], Salamanca 2013, pp. 83-93&lt;/ref&gt; Formally Irujo was to ensure that the document provides no basis for legal action;&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; it is neither clear whether he contributed to the political content nor how he reconciled the task with his Carlist identity.&lt;ref&gt;one scholar claims that appearance of ''El Partido Carlista y los Fueros Vasko-Nabarros'' changed Carlist perception of the nascent Basque political movement; until 1897 Carlism did not consider the Basque nationalism any force to be reckoned with, Fínez García 2013, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; He helped the Aranas also otherwise, e.g. propagating their new periodical, ''Berritarra'', in Estella, or contributing to pro-nationalist turn of a Pamplona daily ''[[:eu:El Fuerista|El Fuerista]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Irujo mediated between Arana and jefe of the daily, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 73. ''El Fuerista'' was originally founded in 1888 as a daily of an ofshoot Carlist branch, the Integrists, compare ''El Fuerista'' entry, [in:] 
Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia online, available [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/46428 here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Irujo fell short of open political access to the Aranistas and their [[Partido Nacionalista Vasco]]. Prior to the 1898 elections to the [[:es:Diputación Foral de Vizcaya|Biscay diputación provincial]] Sabino Arana suggested that Irujo runs as his representative, but the latter declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Elizondo, ''Sabino Arana. El hombre y su trayectoria'', Bilbao 1992, {{ISBN|8488379021}}, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; His exact views are not clear; it is not known what his opinion was about the conflict and rapprochement between the Aranistas and [[Euskalerriacos]] or general twists and turns of the PNV strategy. At some point between 1899 and 1902 he entered [[Centro Vasco]] in Bilbao and subscribed to militant nationalist periodicals, ''La Patria'' and ''Euskalduna''.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Sabino Arana in Larrinaga prison, 1895.jpg|thumb|[[Sabino Arana|Arana]] in prison]]
In 1902 Sabino Arana was detained in relation to a telegram message he intended to send to [[Theodore Roosevelt|president Roosevelt]], congratulating him on recognition of [[Cuba]], until 1898 the Spanish possession. The charges advanced referred to assault on Spanish territorial integrity. The defendant again asked Irujo to represent him. In general terms the defense mounted was very much similar to that of 1896, pointing to Basque rights and revocation of the 1840s regulations;&lt;ref&gt;"Arana no busca la independencia sino el estado de libertades anterior a 1839; no existe delito en el telegrama puesto que no se cursó", quoted after Javier G. Chamorro, ''Bitarte: humanidades e historia del conflicto vasco-navarro'' , s.l. 2009, {{ISBN|9788461307111}}, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Irujo reiterated his claim that nationalism was not equal to separatism.&lt;ref&gt;Arantzazu Ametzaga Iribarren, ''Sabino Arana Goiri y su abogado defensor, Daniel Irujo Urra, juicio de 1896'', [in:] ''Nabarralde'' service, available [http://www.nabarralde.com/eu/nabarmena/13212-sabino-arana-goiri-y-su-abogado-defensor-daniel-irujo-urra-juicio-de-1896 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of specific charges he argued that the telegram message intended expressed admiration and nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;Amézaga 2003, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; At the final stage aided by Teodoro Aguirre,&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 74, José Antonio de Aguirre y Lecube, ''Escape Via Berlin: Eluding Franco in Hitler's Europe'', Reno 1944, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Irujo again emerged triumphant; the defendant was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;1902 Irujo defended also other in other lawsuits, namely against Centro Vasco and one of its members, Dámaso Arana; he was successful in both, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 76-7&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to charge his client&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained close friendship with Sabino Arana until the latter’s death in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;following the death of Arana Irujo published one of his very few known literary pieces known, ''La bandera nacionalista vulgo Bikaitarra'', reproduced in Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estella oak affair==
[[File:Guernica, Gernikako arbola 1891.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Guernica oak, 1890s]]
Throughout the entire Bilbao period Irujo maintained close links with Navarre&lt;ref&gt;in 1901 Irujo was emong co-founders of Circulo Navarro in Bilbao and entered its Junta Directiva; he also remained inscriptred into the Pamplona Colegio de Abogados in Pamplona, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 77, 85. His visits were acknowledged in the Navarrese press, see ''El Eco de Navarra'' 17.06.00, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=6010220&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and with Estella. Around 1904 he returned to his native city; exact reasons remain unclear and perhaps are related to taking care of local family business.&lt;ref&gt;Irujo owned some robadas of land near Estella, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 219; upon return he was growing vineyards, Anasagasti 1975, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He re-entered the local Carlist círculo; around that time the Carlist jefe in Vascongadas, [[Tirso de Olazábal y Lardizábal|Tirso Olazábal]],&lt;ref&gt;the issue is not entirely clear. Olazábal was the Carlist jefe in Vascongadas ,but not in Navarre, where the leader at the time was Francisco Martinez, Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis Complutense], Madrid 2012, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; offered him the party jefatura in the [[:es:Merindad de Estella|merindad of Estella]] and Irujo accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Olazábal’s proposal is mentioned may time in Irujo’s biography, but never with a clear information that he accepted the offer, see Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 10, 15, 90, 153, 156. From the background it might be understood that he did&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time he also openly engaged in political strife. In the local realm dominated by the Conservatives&lt;ref&gt;in Estella named Ochoistas, after local Conservative leader Enrique Ochoa Cintora&lt;/ref&gt; and the Carlists,&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; in 1905 he decided to represent the latter when running for the Estella [[ayuntamiento]];&lt;ref&gt;some presented him as independent Carlist , Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; PNV at the time did not have its representatives in the area and explicitly banned their sympathizers from voting other parties.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Irujo was successful&lt;ref&gt;the Ochoistas won 5 tickets and the Carlists claimed 3. Possibly both parties closed a political deal beforehand, which guaranteed success of any of their candidates, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; and though initially his mandate was revoked on procedural ground,&lt;ref&gt;it was raised that Irujo was not resident in Estella and that as juez municipal he was not allowed to be a concejal at the same time. Irujo claimed he was resident and that as juez he was allowed to stand. Indeed, soon – and unlike his father 40 years earlier – he resigned his juez assignement, ''El Eco de Navarra'' 06.12.05, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=6007631&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was eventually reinstated in early 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 97-8&lt;/ref&gt; In line with official requirements, he declared his political affiliation as Carlist.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; The first year of his tenure was a routine one,&lt;ref&gt;as a concejal he took part in ayuntamiento stand against the 1906 Ley de Asociaciones, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps except minor Carlist political demonstrations he took part in.&lt;ref&gt;when [[Fernando Primo de Rivera]] was nominated minister of war in 1907, the Estella ayuntamiento planned to send him a routine congratulation note. Irujo and the Carlists opposed the motion; Primo was the military leader who drove the Carlists from Estella in 1876, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 the Aranista Centro Vasco of Bilbao used the services of Irujo’s brother-in-law Aranzadi to offer the Estella city a [[shoot]] from the [[Guernica oak]], a symbol of vasco-navarrese fueros.&lt;ref&gt;Centro Vasco offered 8 shoots to 8 different ayuntamientos in Vascongadas and Navarre&lt;/ref&gt; Irujo passed the proposal to ayuntamiento,&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; which accepted the offer&lt;ref&gt;the offer itself was by no means unusual. In 1898 the Biscay Diputación Provinvial offered a shoot of the Guernica oak to the Navarrese Diputación Provincial; it was accepted and the shoot was planted, Fuentes Megina 2013, pp. 29-31&lt;/ref&gt; and in a pompous ceremony few months later planted the shoot at a patio of a local school.&lt;ref&gt;exact location of the spot where the shoot was planted is not clear. Sources refer to it as "internal patio of Escuelas Pias". The school exists today as the Basque ikastola, yet it seems that the spot is at the courtyard of what is now the nearby Casa de Cultura Fray San Diego; it is not marked anywhow&lt;/ref&gt; Navarrese press remained largely sympathetic, but a Liberal daily raised alarm, claiming that the local self-government fuels Basque separatism.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 115-116, 229&lt;/ref&gt; As nationwide press followed suit the issue turned into a scandal, especially that the ceremony was marked by Basque and Navarrese flavor with almost total absence of official references to Spain;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. during an evening orchestra concert the same day the only songs played were those from a Basque and Navarrese repertoire, while the invitation letter commenced with "Gora Euzkadi!" When speaking, an invited guest from Centro Vasco made frequent references to "la nación pirenaica" and concluded with "Gora Nabarra! Gora Euzkadi!"&lt;/ref&gt; moderate Irujo’s address&lt;ref&gt;Irujo he was specifically asked by the mayor, who at the last minute developed some anxiety about "certain flavor" of the planned feast, to avoid controversial and personal references. According to some scholars, it was the reason why he mentioned neither Carlism nor Llorens. On the other hand, some claim that Irujo most likely mentioned Arana in his address, Arantzazu Ametzaga Iribarren, ''El árbol de Gernika en Nabarra'', [in:] ''Noticias de Navarra'' 15.02.17, available [http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2017/02/15/opinion/tribunas/el-arbol-de-gernika-en-nabarra here]&lt;/ref&gt; was interrupted by angry "Viva España!" cries from the disgusted crowd.&lt;ref&gt;perhaps the most controversial passage of Irujo’s address was his reference to "treason of Maroto", the 1839 accord concluded by the Carlist leader general Maroto with the governmental commander. It was at this point that several vivas to España were heard, apparently in disapproval of Irujo’s comments, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 112, 114, Fuentes Megina 2013, pp. 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; The council declared they had been unaware that the shoot originated from Centro Vasco and suggested having been maneuvered into a separatist affair, blaming Aranzadi and Irujo for the miscommunication.
[[File:Estella-Lizarra 01.JPG|thumb|Estella]]
At the council sittings and in the press Irujo claimed that ayuntamiento was perfectly aware of the shoot origins,&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; yet his arguments were rejected. The shoot was sent back to Centro Vasco and replaced by new ones, officially provided by the Biscay diputación.&lt;ref&gt;some suggests that the Estella council was genuinely concerned that shoots provided originally were not original, Fuentes Megina 2013, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; They were planted 3 weeks after the first ceremony. The re-implantation was an equally public though somewhat less pompous event; this time the Spanish and Navarrese features were carefully balanced, while the Basque ones were absent.&lt;ref&gt;the original implantation took place on March 15, 1908. The second one took place on April 8, 1908. Among flags of Spain and vivas to España, Marcha Real was played a number of times, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 140. Exact fate of the shoot is not clear; according to one source, it grew into a tree and at unspecified time and in unspecified circumstances it was cut down. Another tree was planted in 2004, but it was cut down by unknown perpetrators in 2009, compare ''Hispanismo'' service, available [http://hispanismo.org/navarra/10428-talan-hachazos-un-retono-del-arbol-de-guernica-en-estella.html here]. Some identify the culprits as "fanaticos Navarristas", see e.g. Xabier Zabaltza, ''Gernikako arbola, un himno huerfano'', [in:] ''Historia  Contemporánea'' 54 (2017), p. 235. This would suggest that the oak keeps generating political controversies, in this case related to Navarrismo and its opposition to Basque nationalism&lt;/ref&gt; Embittered with the city council blaming him for the affair, in the immediate aftermath Irujo ceased to attend its sittings, excusing himself for the absence.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1908 the ayuntamiento admitted he was right, but this did not make Irujo change his mind. In early 1909 the mayor and his deputy resigned; technically, as segundo teniente de alcalde Irujo was becoming the interim [[alcalde]]. At this point he formally resigned his counselor mandate and did not stand in the successive elections of May 1909.

==From Carlist to Nationalist==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard from 1935]]
Initially the Carlist ''[[:es:El Pensamiento Navarro|El Pensamiento Navarro]]'' acknowledged the first implantation with sympathy, praising the homage to "nuestras libertades tradicionales" and complaining only about lack of Irujo’s references to Carlist champions of Navarrese rights like Llorens.&lt;ref&gt;according to some scholars Irujo did not mention Llorens in his address complying with the mayor’s request to avoid controversial political references, and the Carlist press was perfectly aware of that, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 114, 124, Fuentes Megina 2013, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; However, soon the party press – especially in Vascongadas – assumed a hostile tone; the Gipuzkoan ''[[:es:La Voz de Guipúzcoa|La Voz de Guipúzcoa]]'' lambasted Irujo as "concejal reaccionario"&lt;ref&gt;this tag was later repeated by other titles elsewhere, see e.g. a Valencian daily ''El Pueblo'', 17.03.08, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=1000180918&amp;presentacion=pagina here], or as "individuo  muy  significado  por  sus tendencias  reaccionarias", ''La Correspondencia Militar'' 17.03.08, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001958309&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[:es:El Correo de Guipúzcoa|El Correo de Guipúzcoa]]'' linked the event to venomous anti-Spanish separatism.&lt;ref&gt;including groups advancing the "muera España" cries, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 127-8&lt;/ref&gt; Carlist circles&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and provincial leaders&lt;ref&gt;on March 27 the Carlist tycoon [[José María de Orbe y Gaytán|marqués de Valdespina]] congratulated the ayuntamiento for their "entusiasmo el patriótico acuerdo", ending his address with "vivas a España y a Euskeria", Fuentes Megina 2013, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; were sending messages congratulating the ayuntamiento on their decision to send the original shoot back. Another Carlist in the council, Nicanor Larráinzar Senosiáin, led an all-out charge on Irujo, also publicly,&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 117, 133&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that his support for the Aranistas was incompatible with Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;both Irujo and Larráinar address their opened letters to their opponents, virulently listing their official titles as received "por gracia de su Majestad don Alfonso XIII",  Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 145. Such a phrase, normally quite innocent, sounded like an insult when penned by a Carlist&lt;/ref&gt; Irujo denied separatist charges, charged his opponent with political opportunism&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 142-143&lt;/ref&gt; and initially confirmed his Carlist identity. Things changed when Tirso Olazábal congratulated Larráinzar on his stand.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In a public letter to Olazábal Irujo considered himself disauthorised; speculating that apparently he had been erroneous as to fuerista objectives of the Carlists, he declared leaving Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to Luis Arana Irujo proclaimed that from then on he would not be any "carlo-bizkaitarra", but "nacionalista vasco a secas".&lt;ref&gt;"en Bilbao me llamaban carlo-bizkaitarra y tenían razón; ahora no tengo nada de cario, y me abrazo en cuerpo y alma a Jel [Jaungoikoa Eta Lagizarrak], sin aditamento de ningún género", quoted after Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 157, see also [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TCN56ZUSD0 here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when in late 1908 offered a post in Navarrese Partido Nacionalista Vasco structures, he declined. The reasons are not clear. Some scholars speculate that aware of growing controversy between Arana and Aranzadi, Irujo could have not brought himself to taking a stand; another reason might have been growing rivalry between a radical Navarrese wing of Evangelista de Ibero&lt;ref&gt;padre Evangelista de Ibero, who nurtured strongly anti-Carlist views, remained on close terms at least with Irujo’s sons, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and a more moderate one championed by his brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 158-9, 160-161&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he remained in touch with PNV activists both in Navarre and in [[Biscay]]. When their new Navarrese periodical ''Napartarra'' was launched in 1911, Irujo featured as one of its collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;''Napartarra'', [in:] ''Gran Enciclopedia Navarra'' online , available [http://www.enciclopedianavarra.com/?page_id=15072 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Some students speculate that had it not been for his premature death,&lt;ref&gt;Irujo and his wife developed pneumonia; she got better but he did not, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Irujo would have represented the Nationalists in forthcoming elections.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of the Basque Country alternative proportions.svg|thumb|[[ikurriña]]]]
One scholar concludes that indeed, apparent Irujo’s attempt to match Nationalist and Carlist objectives was mission impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; He identifies Irujo's political position as "radical fuerismo",&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; its essence being reversal to pre-1839 regime.&lt;ref&gt;García-Sanz Marcotegui 2002, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Deprived of anti-Spanish venom&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1901, when organizing San Fermín feast in Circulo Navarro in Bilbao, he ended th event with Vivas to España, for which he was later criticised by militant Basque press, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and far from classic separatism, it envisioned Vasco-Navarrese area as sovereign entities united with other Spanish political bodies by a common monarch. It also did not include "los aspectos más negativos del aranismo", i.e. racism.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear to what extent Irujo embraced [[nationalism]] as emerging in Europe of the time. He certainly acknowledged and appreciated separated Basque identity, yet it seems that his vision of Basque commonality was based on geography, religion,&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 203; he sent a postcarcd with sagrado corazón to his nephew and brought up own children in religious zeal&lt;/ref&gt; history and culture rather than on ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;claiming that the only ambition of "nacionalidades vascas" was return to pre-1839 rule, Irujo noted also that "en una palabra, todo cuanto una nación necesita para regirse y gobernarse por sí sin injerencias extrañas aunque constituya parte integrante de un Estado compuesto de nacionalidades distintas", Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he hailed the newly invented icon of Basque nationalism, [[ikurriña]],&lt;ref&gt;referred to as "shroud which covers all Basques", Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; and called for unification of all Basques in "tierra euzkeriana". Another scholar considers Irujo a typical case of transitory identity from Carlism&lt;ref&gt;according to a contemporary scholar, the Carlists of the time boasted restoration of fueros as their war cry, but in fact they adjourned it ad calendas graecas, and approached it mostly as means of mobilizing support, Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, p. 11. As one of the fuerista activists put it, before their own advent "la reintegración foral era un sueño dorado; nadie pensaba que pudiera llegar a ser una realidad. Confesémoslo: éramos fueristas, pero no teníamos fe, no teníamos esperanza. Bastaba para satisfacer nuestra conciencia afirmar el deseo de la reintegración foral y precisar bien el alcance de nuestro deseo", Garcia-Sanz Marcotegui 1995, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; to peripheral nationalism,&lt;ref&gt;he also summarised Irujo’s political trajectory somewhat differently, namely that "carlista en sus orígenes, evolucionó hacia el nacionalismo vasco a finales del siglo xix, para regresar, a principios del Novecientos, a la órbita carlista", Jordi Canal, ''¿En busca del precedente perdido? Tríptico sobre las complejas relaciones entre carlismo y catalanismo a fines del siglo XIX'', [in:] ''Historia y Politica'' 14 (2005), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; parallel to those of [[Marian Vayreda i Vila|Vayreda]] (Catalonia), [[:es:Alfredo Brañas|Brañas]] (Galicia) and [[José María de Pereda|Pereda]] (Cantabria).&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2005, p. 62, Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo. Dos siglos de contrarrevolución en España'', Madrid 2004, {{ISBN|9788420639475}}, p. 249, Jordi Canal, ''Marian Vayreda, entre el carlisme i el catalánisme'', [in:] ''Revista de Girona'' 225 (2004), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; One more author considers Irujo irrelevant when discussing relations between "fuerismo [[Traditionalism (Spain)|tradicionalista]]" and "nacionalismo vasco".&lt;ref&gt;in a dedicated thesis specifically discussing mutual relations between fuerismo of Carlist origin and the nascent Basque nationalism, focused on the turn of the centuries, Irujo is not mentioned a single time, see José Ignacio Fínez García, ''Fuerismo tradicionalista]] y nacionalismo vasco'' [MA thesis Universidad de Salamanca], Salamanca 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isabella ''' "'''Ella'''" ''' Robertson Christie''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FRSGS|FSAS|FRGS}} (21 April 1861 - 29 January 1949) was a pioneering Scottish traveller and explorer, landowner, gardener and author.

==Early life==
Christie was born on 21 April 1861 at Millbank in [[Cockpen, Midlothian|Cockpen]], near Bonnyrigg, to Alison (née Philp, c.1817–1894) and [[John Christie (landowner)|John Christie]] (1824&amp;ndash;1902), a Scottish industrialist and landowner. Christie had an elder brother, John Coldwells who died in childhood in his twelfth year in 1872,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = 'Alicella': a memoir of Alice King Stewart and Ella Christie|last = Stewart|first = Averill|publisher = John Murray|year = 1955|isbn = |location = London|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a younger sister, Alice Margaret.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  In 1865 Christie's father purchased the Castleton estate in the [[Ochil Hills|Ochils]], renaming it Cowden Castle, and the family moved there. Christie and her sister were educated at home by her parents and governesses.  From an early age she made annual trips with her parents to Europe including [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and the [[Low Countries]]. After her mother's death and her sister's marriage Christie continued to travel with her father and also alone or with a friend. She visited [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Syria]] and started to write about her trips.

On her father's death in 1902 it was found that he had disinherited both Christie and her sister, leaving the entirety of his estate to an orphanage that he had founded without their knowledge. They contested the will and in 1903 it was settled with the estate being divided between the two sisters and the orphanage.  Ella lived on at Cowden Castle and managed the estate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Isabella Christie|url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/55607|website = www.oxforddnb.com|access-date = 2016-01-16|last = Baker|first = Anne Pimlott|date = 2004|publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Zs6qBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|date = 2006-03-08|isbn = 9780748626601|first = Elizabeth L.|last = Ewan|first2 = Sue|last2 = Innes|first3 = Sian|last3 = Reynolds|first4 = Rose|last4 = Pipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gardening Women: Their Stories From 1600 to the Present|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RKqMMceJjukC|publisher = Little, Brown Book Group|date = 2010-05-06|isbn = 9780748118335|first = Catherine|last = Horwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Travels ==
After her father's death Christie's travels became more ambitious and she began to travel more widely. From 1904 to 1905 she travelled with her maid, Humphries, initially to India and then on to [[Kashmir]], [[Tibet]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] and [[Borneo]]. Being well connected and carrying letters of introduction she attended a banquet with the [[maharaja]] of Kashmir and dined with [[Herbert Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]. Her adventures saw her camping in the snow at [[Chorbat Valley|Chorbat Pass]], sailing in a cargo ship full of pigs, travelling by pack horse and cart in the Kashmir wilderness and trekking by foot for 60 miles in the [[Deosai Mountains|Desoi mountains]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1907 she visited China, Korea and Japan.  While in Japan Christie was fascinated by the Japanese formal style of gardening, an interest that  would inspire her to create a Japanese garden at Cowden Castle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1910 she packed a camp bed, stove, lamp, oatmeal and biscuits and travelled to [[Russian Turkestan]]. Her journey took her to [[Constantinople]] across the [[Black Sea]], through [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the [[Caspian Sea]] and onwards to [[Ashgabat|Ashkabad]] and [[Merv]].  She travelled by train and boat along the [[Silk Road]], visiting [[Bukhara|Buhkhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Kokand]], and finally to [[Andijan|Andhizan.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Christie undertook a further trip to the [[Russian Empire]] in 1912.  Starting in [[Saint Petersburg]] she travelled by train, steamer and [[droshky]] to [[Tashkent]], Samarkand and [[Khiva]]. She was the first British woman to ever visit Khiva.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1914 she visited the United States and Cuba.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Christie kept an account of her travels in her diaries and she was in regular correspondence with her sister. She later wrote about her trips to the Russian Empire in the book ''Through Khiva to golden Samarkand''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Isabella Christie|url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/55607|website = www.oxforddnb.com|access-date = 2016-01-16|last = Baker|first = Anne Pimlott|date = 2004|publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Zs6qBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|date = 2006-03-08|isbn = 9780748626601|first = Elizabeth L.|last = Ewan|first2 = Sue|last2 = Innes|first3 = Sian|last3 = Reynolds|first4 = Rose|last4 = Pipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gardening Women: Their Stories From 1600 to the Present|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RKqMMceJjukC|publisher = Little, Brown Book Group|date = 2010-05-06|isbn = 9780748118335|first = Catherine|last = Horwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War I ==
In 1916, Christie travelled to France to become the manager of the ''L'Oeuvre de la Goutte de Café'' at [[Bar-sur-Aube]]. This network of cafés was established by the French and [[British Red Cross]] as a places for tired soldiers to relax and rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Full text of "For dauntless France, an account of Britain's aid to the French wounded and victims of the war;"|url = https://archive.org/stream/fordauntlessfran00biny/fordauntlessfran00biny_djvu.txt|website = archive.org|access-date = 2016-01-17|pages = 190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The café that Christie managed was staffed by five Scottish women and served the soldiers fighting at the [[Battle of Verdun]]. From 1918-1919 Christie oversaw another ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'LOuevre de la Goutte de Café'' at [[Mulhouse|Mul]][[Mulhouse|house]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Zs6qBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|date = 2006-03-08|isbn = 9780748626601|first = Elizabeth L.|last = Ewan|first2 = Sue|last2 = Innes|first3 = Sian|last3 = Reynolds|first4 = Rose|last4 = Pipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Japanese garden at Cowden Castle ==
After her visit to Japan in 1907 Christie was inspired to create a seven-acre [[Japanese garden]] at her home at Cowden Castle. She employed Taki Handi, from the Royal School of Garden Design in Nagoya, to help plan and design the garden.  The [[Stream|burn]] on the estate was dammed and a hollow made to create an artificial [[loch]] and a pond and island garden was developed along with a stroll garden and a tea-house garden.  Plants, shrubs, trees and a traditional stone lantern were imported from Japan. The garden was named ''Shāh-raku-en'' meaning a place of pleasure or delight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Christie was advised on the form, maintenance and development of the garden by Professor Jijo Soya Suzuki, Master of the Soami School of Imperial Design.  Suzuki considered the garden to the best Japanese garden in the Western world. Shinzaburo Matsuo lived and worked at Cowden as gardener from 1925 until his death in 1937.  [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] visited the garden in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recognition for Japanese garden at Cowden Castle|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-23970528|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = The Japanese Garden at Cowden Castle|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i2IMYh_kT0|date = 2014-09-22|accessdate = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Christie's death in 1949 the garden was maintained by workers on the Cowden estate.  In 1963 it was vandalised and the teahouses and bridges were burned and the lanterns and shrines knocked into the loch.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.fineartcommissions.com/cowden/pdf/the-japanese-garden-at-cowden-castle-restoration-appeal.pdf|title = The Japanese Garden, Cowden Castle, Scotland.

[[File:The potters' market, with Mosque and Fellah Women in the Background, at Gizeh, A suburb of Cairo. (1911) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|275px|Fellahin in Gizeh, Cairo (1911)]]
'''Fellah''' ({{lang-ar|فلاح}}, fallāḥ; plural ''Fellaheen'' or ''Fellahin'', {{lang-ar|فلاحين}}, fallāḥīn) is a farmer or agricultural laborer in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. The word derives from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for "ploughman" or "tiller".

A fellah could be seen wearing a simple cotton robe called ''galabieh'' ([[jellabiya]]). The word ''Galabieh'' originated around 1715–25 and derived from the Egyptian Arabic word ''gallabīyah'' (جلابية).

==Origins and usage==
Fellahin was the term used throughout the Middle East in the Ottoman period and later to refer to villagers and farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yemen Into the Twenty-First Century: Continuity and Change|first1=Kamil A.|last1=Mahdi|first2=Anna|last2=Würth|first3=Helen|last3=Lackner|publisher=Garnet &amp; Ithaca Press|year=2007|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1Mebwe9R_AC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=fellahin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nur-eldeen Masalha]] translates it as "peasants,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catastrophe Remembered: Palestine, Israel and the Internal Refugees: Essays in Memory of Edward W. Said (1935-2003)|first=Nur|last=Masalha|publisher=Zed Books|year=2005|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellahin were distinguished from the ''[[effendi]],'' or, land-owning class,&lt;ref&gt;''State Lands and Rural Development in mandatory Palestine, 1920–1948'', Warwick P. N. Tyler, Sussex Academic Press, 2001, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; although the fellahin in this region might be tenant farmers, smallholders, or live in a village that owned the land communally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hillel Cohen]], [[Army of Shadows, Palestinian Collaboration with Zionism, 1917–1948]], University of California Press, 2008, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Healing the Land and the Nation: Malaria and the Zionist Project in Palestine, 1920–1947'', Sandra Marlene Sufian, University of Chicago Press, 2007, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Others applied the term ''fellahin'' only to landless workers.&lt;ref&gt;Lords of the Lebanese Marches: Violence and Narrative in an Arab Society, Michael Gilsenan, I.B.Tauris, 2003, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''fallahin'' applied to [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Druze]], [[Musta'arabi Jews|Jewish]] and [[Muslim]] villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Syria and the Holy Land|first1=George Adam|last1=Smith|publisher=George H. Doran company|year=1918|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myEYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=fellahin+syria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''fallah'' was applied to people from several regions in the [[Middle East]], including those of [[Egypt]], [[Levant]], [[Iraq]] and [[Cyprus]].

==Fellahin in Egypt==
Comprising 60% of the Egyptian population in both Lower and Upper Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080514092415re_rn_1/www.semp.us/publications/biot_reader.php?BiotID=312 Who are the Fellahin? – Biot #312: December 24, 2005]''.

In 1927, anthropologist Winifred Blackman, author of ''The Fellahin of Upper Egypt'', conducted [[ethnographic]] research on the life of Upper Egyptian farmers and concluded that there were observable continuities between the cultural and religious beliefs and practices of the fellahin and those of ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref name="note5"&gt;{{cite news|first=Caryll|last=Faraldi|title=A genius for hobnobbing|date=11–17 May 2000|publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2000/481/bk3_481.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freyja Haraldsdóttir''' (born 27 June 1986) is an Icelandic politician and a disability rights activist. She was elected to the [[Icelandic Constitutional Assembly]] in 2010 and chosen to become a deputy Member of Parliament of the [[Althing]] in 2013.

==Early life and education==
Freyja was born on 27 June 1986 in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]{{sfn|Freyja|2017|p=10}} with [[osteogenesis imperfecta]]. In 1997, Haraldsdóttir and her family moved to [[Nelson, New Zealand]] where she went to school in the neighbouring town of [[Richmond, New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="kidson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kidson |first1=Sally |title=Icelandic woman changes mindsets|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/9063777/Icelandic-woman-changes-mindsets|accessdate=23 October 2017|work=Stuff.co.nz |date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freyja graduated from the [[University of Iceland]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[social pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Freyja Haraldsdóttir

==Career==
Before going into politics, Freyja was an advocate in support of providing people with disabilities with personal assistants. She was convinced to enter politics after meeting with former [[Bright Future (Iceland)|Bright Future party]] member [[Gudmundur Steingrimsson]] who was leading a committee that aligned with her career. In 2010, Freyja was elected onto the [[Icelandic Constitutional Assembly]]. During her term, she was selected to become Steingrimsson's deputy Member of Parliament for the [[Althing]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="kidson"/&gt; Her tenure of vice president for [[Southwest Constituency]] lasted from 2013 until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freyja Haraldsdóttir|url=https://www.althingi.is/altext/cv/is/?nfaerslunr=1188 |website=Alþingi|accessdate=25 October 2017|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of her political career, Freyja worked at [[Independent Living Centre]] from 2010 to 2014 as a director. After leaving the ILC, she co-founded the company [[Tabú]] whose goal is to create safe spaces for women with disabilities in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |author=Freyja Haraldsdóttir |date=February 2017 |title=‘I am discriminated against because I exist’ |type=MA |chapter= |publisher=University of Iceland |url=https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/26559/1/mastersthesis-FreyjaHaraldsdo%cc%81ttir.pdf |pages=12-13 |access-date=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2018, after her political career ended, she was subject to insults and reportedly "seal noises" by Members of Parliament who were recorded in a bar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2018/11/29/mp_s_in_recorded_bar_conversation_also_made_fun_of_/ Iceland Monitor, "MP's in recorded bar conversation also made fun of disabled MP"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono X''' (also spelled as '''Hamengkubuwana X''', often abbreviated as '''HB X''') (born BRM Herjuno Darpito, 2 April 1946 in [[Yogyakarta]]) is the [[Sultan]] of the historic [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] in [[Indonesia]], and is currently also the [[Governor]] of the modern [[Yogyakarta Special Region]] (''Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta'').

Hamengkubuwono X succeeded his father, [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] as the Sultan of Yogyakarta when Hamengkubuwono IX died on 3 October 1988. Hamengkubuwono X was formally installed as Sultan on 7 March 1989. However, the position of the Governor of the Yogyakarta Special Region did not go to Hamengkubuwono X. Vice Governor [[Sri Paku Alam VIII]], prince of the subordinate enclave of [[Paku Alaman]] within Yogyakarta was instead controversially elevated to the position of governor. This was in contrary to the agreement made at the independence of Indonesia in recognition of Hamengkubuwono IX's support and role in the Indonesian War of Independence. Under the agreement, the Yogyakarta Sultan holds the position of governor in the Yogyakarta Special Region, and the Paku Alam holds the position of vice governor.

After the fall of the [[Suharto]] regime in May 1998, and following the death of Sri Paku Alam VIII on 11 September 1998, the central government required an election be held for the post of Yogyakarta Governor. Hamengkubuwono X was democratically elected as the Governor on 3 October 1998.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

On 30 August 2012, following a decade of talks between Yogyakarta and the central government, the [[People's Consultative Assembly|national legislature of Indonesia]] formally enshrined in law the convention that the Sultan inherits the position of governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/09/yogyakartas-sultans |title= Yogyakarta's sultans &amp;mdash; Carrying on|last1= N.O. |first1= |date=2012-09-06 |website=[[The Economist]] |publisher= |accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hamengkubuwono X was a graduate of Public Administration at the Faculty of Law of [[Gajah Mada University]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]].

Hamengkubuwono X was active as Chairman DIY KADINDAII (Business Association), Chairman of the DPD Golkar DIY (Golongan Karya Party Yogyakarta), Chairman of the DIY Sports Committee Chairman and Managing Director of PT Punokawan Construction, President of the PG Madukismo Commissioner, and in July 1996 was appointed Chairman of the DIY Expert Counsel to the Governor.

Hamengkubuwono X followed the tradition of his late father Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX in the spirit of Indonesian Nationalism over self-interest by participating in street protests in support of the student demonstrations opposing Suharto's rule on May 14 of 1998, and like his illustrious father, wanted to be a pioneer in the Yogyakarta Reformation Movement albeit in a non-violent manner.

Hamengkubuwono X was also one of the four key figures in the early reform period sparked Ciganjur Declaration urging the government to hold elections as soon as possible, because President [[BJ Habibie]] had neither [[Constitutional]] nor legal right to resume the presidency of Suharto who had just resigned.

Hamengkubuwono X has stated his vision for his region and Sultanate is the development of science and technology, development of agriculture, tourism and world-famous cultural industries and thus provide a fair and prosperous life to all his citizens.

Hamengkubuwono X was nominated by popular choice, Golkar Yogyakarta Assembly as a Presidential Candidate for the 2009 Indonesian Presidential Election Campaign. Hamengkubuwono X, though widely respected across all parties and nationwide as neutral, honest and uncorrupted was ultimately unsuccessful in garnering support outside [[Central Java]] and was unsuccessful to attain first round voting position.

==Personal life==
Hamengkubuwono X has discontinued the [[polygamist]] tradition of Javanese royalty with kings having several wives and possible multiple [[concubine]]s, as per his late father's wishes to modernize the royal system and thus women's rights, and to lead by example and is married to [[Ratu]] [[Gusti Kanjeng Ratu (GKR) Hemas]].

Their five daughters (in birth order) are:
* Crown Princess [[Princess Mangkubumi|Gusti Kanjeng Ratu Mangkubumi]] (heiress presumptive) married to [[Kanjeng Pangeran Haryo Wironegoro]]
* [[Gusti Kanjeng Ratu Condrokirono]] divorced

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1748">'''Henry Kiddle''' (15 January 1824 [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[England]] - 1891) was a [[United States]] educator and had an interest in [[spiritualism]].

==Biography==
He came as a boy to [[New York City]] where he studied under private tutors and at the normal school. In 1843, he was made principal of a ward school, but two years later resigned to take charge of one connected with the [[Leake and Watts Children's Home]]. He was principal of a grammar school 1846-1856. He was then appointed deputy superintendent of [[New York City Department of Education|common schools in New York City]]. He was made superintendent in 1870, but resigned in 1879, owing to an adverse public sentiment created by his avowal of a belief in spiritualism.

Mr. Kiddle received the degree of A. M. from Union College in 1848, and that of “officier d'académie” from the University of France in 1878. He has published in pamphlet form various addresses on education, modern spiritualism, and religious topics. He edited several revisions of Goold Brown's ''English Grammar'' (last ed., New York, 1882) and other school text books, including a ''Text-Book of Physics'' (1883), and wrote ''A Manual of Astronomy and the Use of the Globes'' (1882), ''New Elementary Astronomy'' (1868), ''Cyclopædia of Education'' (1877) with [[Alexander J. Schem]], ''Year Books of Education, 1878-1879'', and ''Spiritual Communications'' (1879).

'''Hermeto Pascoal''' (born June 22, 1936) is a Brazilian composer and multi-instrumentalist. He was born in [[Lagoa da Canoa]], [[Alagoas]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slipcue.com/music/brazil/pascoal.html|title=Hermeto Pascoal Discography - Slipcue.com Brazilian Music Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascoal is a beloved figure in the history of [[music of Brazil|Brazilian music]], known for his abilities in orchestration and improvisation, as well as being a record producer and contributor to many Brazilian and international albums by other artists.&lt;ref name=ALLMUSIC&gt;{{cite web|last=Neder |first=Alvaro |url={{Allmusic|class=artist |id=p112663/biography |pure_url=yes}} |title=Hermeto Pascoal |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
[[File:Hermeto Pascoal - Portrait by Gert Chesi.jpg|thumb|Hermeto Pascoal - Portrait by Gert Chesi]]
[[File:HermetoBsAs78-Arturo-Encina.jpg|thumb|left|Pascoal in Buenos Aires 1978.]]
Pascoal comes from a remote corner of northeastern Brazil, an area that lacked electricity at the time he was born. He learned the accordion from his father and practised for hours indoors as, being albino, he was incapable of working in the fields with the rest of his family.&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC" /&gt;

Hermeto's career began in [[1964 in music|1964]] with appearances on several Brazilian recordings alongside relatively unknown groups. These now-classic albums and the musicians involved ([[Edu Lobo]], [[Elis Regina]], [[Cesar Camargo Mariano]]) established widely influential new directions in post-[[bossa nova]] Brazilian jazz.

In 1966, he played in the [[Sambrasa Trio]], with [[Airto Moreira]] and [[Humberto Clayber]]; they released only one album, ''[[Em Som Maior]]''. Then he joined Trio Novo (Airto Moreira, [[Heraldo do Monte]], [[Theo de Barros]]) and in 1967 the group, renamed [[Quarteto Novo]], released an album that launched the careers of Pascoal and Moreira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nscottrobinson.com/airto.php |title=N. Scott Robinson-World Music and Percussion, Frame Drums, Riq, Tambourines |publisher=Nscottrobinson.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascoal would then go on to join the multi-faceted group Brazilian Octopus.

===International fame===
[[File:Hermeto Pascoal y Grupo.jpg|thumb|300px|Hermeto Pascoal and group, 2009]]
Pascoal initially caught the international public's attention with an appearance on [[Miles Davis]]'s 1971 album ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'', which featured him on three pieces, which he also composed.&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC" /&gt; Davis said that Pascoal was "the most impressive musician in the world". Later collaborations involved fellow Brazilian musicians Airto Moreira and [[Flora Purim]]. From the late 1970s onward he has mostly led his own groups, playing at many prestigious venues, such as the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1979. Other members of the group have included bassist Itibere Zwarg, pianist [[Jovino Santos-Neto]] and percussionists Nene, Pernambuco and [[Zabelê|Zabele]].

Known as ''o Bruxo'' (the Sorcerer), Pascoal often makes music with unconventional objects such as teapots, children's toys, and animals, as well as keyboards, button accordion, [[melodica]], saxophone, guitar, flute, voice, various brass and folkloric instruments.&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC" /&gt; Perhaps because he grew up in the countryside, he uses nature as a basis for his compositions, as in his ''Música da Lagoa'', in which the musicians burble water and play flutes while immersed in a lagoon: a Brazilian television broadcast from 1999 showed him soloing at one point by singing into a cup with his mouth partially submerged in water. Folk music from rural Brazil is another important influence in his work.&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC" /&gt;

Between 1996 and 1997, Pascoal worked on a book project called ''Calendário do Som'', which contains a song for every day of the year, including 29 February, so that everyone would have a song for his or her birthday.&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC" /&gt;

Hermeto was married to Ilza da Silva, to whom he dedicated many compositions, from 1954 until her death in 2000. They had six children, Jorge, Fábio, Flávia, Fátima, Fabiula and Flávio, and many grandchildren. He was married Aline Morena from 2003 until 2016, while living in [[Curitiba]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aos 77 anos, músico cult Hermeto Pascoal agora quer ser pop - 23/02/2014 - Serafina - Folha de S.Paulo|url = http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/serafina/2014/02/1415484-aos-77-anos-musico-cult-hermeto-pascoal-agora-quer-ser-pop.shtml|website =Folha de S.Paulo|accessdate = 2016-01-10|language = Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aline e Hermeto - namoro musical em Santa Felicidade|url = http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/caderno-g/aline-e-hermeto---namoro-musical-em-santa-felicidade-9h3nqua1d08edwj65ngszy2by|website = Gazeta do Povo|accessdate = 2017-01-08|language = Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www1.folha.uol.com.br"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aos 80, multi-instrumentista Hermeto Pascoal ainda se sente uma criança|url = http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2016/06/1783703-aos-80-multi-instrumentista-hermeto-pascoal-ainda-se-sente-uma-crianca.shtml|website = Folha de S.Paulo|accessdate = 2017-01-08|language = Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since returned to the Jabour neighborhood in [[Bangu, Rio de Janeiro|Bangu]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he spent much of his time living, composing, rehearsing and hosting musicians from all over the world.&lt;ref name="www1.folha.uol.com.br"/&gt;

'''drh. H. Irwandi Yusuf, M.Sc.''' (born in [[Bireuën]], [[Aceh]], Indonesia; 2 August 1960), is an Indonesian politician who served as Governor of [[Aceh|Aceh province]] in north Sumatra. He was re-elected Governor in early 2017 after serving an earlier term between 2006 and 2012.

Irwandi first won a term as governor in the [[Acehnese regional election, 2006|2006 Aceh regional election]] as an independent candidate (non-party). [[Muhammad Nazar|Muhammad Nazar, S. Ag.]] was his running mate in 2006.  However Irwandi lost his 2012 re-election campaign to [[Zaini Abdullah]] following a strong challenge and intensive campaigning by other local political rivals. Allegations that he may have wrongfully granted land concessions involving previously protected high conservation value land to palm oil companies also surfaced before the campaign. In 2017, he was reelected as the Governor of Aceh, with Nova Iriansyah as his partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/04/08/irwandi-yusuf-returns-aceh-governor.html Irwandi Yusuf Returns Aceh Governor] - [[Jakarta Post]] - 8 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the former Free Aceh Movement (GAM) leader is the second Aceh governor implicated in a corruption case after Abdullah Puteh, who was sentenced to 10 years for graft surrounding the procurement of an MI-2 Rostov helicopter worth US$872,500.

Irwandi was arrested and caught red handed in a corruption transaction, along with Bener Meriah Regent Ahmadi and eight other individuals following a suspicious transaction involving provincial and regency officials, according to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). Since Irwandi was caught red-handed by the KPK, he started to lose supports from Acehnese people. He is now still in jail and going through his trial with a possibility of serving 6 years of jail time without parole.

==Biography==
Irwandi Yusuf, a [[veterinarian]] (Alumnus of [[Syiah Kuala University]], [[Banda Aceh]]), joined the [[Free Aceh Movement]] ({{lang-id|Gerakan Aceh Merdeka}} or GAM) in 1990, participating for three years before taking up a scholarship at [[Oregon State University]], US, in 1993, where he undertook a master's degree in Veterinary Science.

After returning to Banda Aceh to teach at his alma mater, Irwandi became a founding member of the Acehnese branch of the [[Fauna and Flora Preservation Society]] (now known as Fauna and Flora International), lending his veterinary expertise to their conservation campaigns.

==Political career==

In 2018, the former Free Aceh Movement (GAM) leader is the second Aceh governor implicated in a corruption case after Abdullah Puteh, who was sentenced to 10 years for graft surrounding the procurement of an MI-2 Rostov helicopter worth US$872,500.

Irwandi was arrested along with Bener Meriah Regent Ahmadi and eight other individuals following a suspicious transaction involving provincial and regency officials, according to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). Since Irwandi was caught red-handed by the KPK, he started to lose supports from Acehnese people. 

In the past, his concern for Acehnese socio-political issues led him into further contact with GAM. He held several different positions in the movement, including as a special staff office for psy warfare in the Central [[Free Aceh Movement|GAM]] command, as negotiation coordinator, and as Expert Staff on counter-intelligence in the Central Command of the Aceh National Army. He spent some time in 2001 with the [[Red Cross]], taking the opportunity to study [[humanitarian law]]. Irwandi was arrested in 2003, and was held as a [[Prisoner of war|war prisoner]] in the Keudah Prison in [[Banda Aceh]].

Irwandi was in his jail cell when the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] struck. The epicentr of the quake was close to the Acehnese coastline. The population of Aceh before the December 2004 tsunami was 4,271,000 (2004). The population as of 15 September 2005 was 4,031,589; a discrepancy of 239,411 lives. 170,000 people were confirmed dead.

As the tsunami's waters rose inside the prison, Irwandi fled to the Musholla (prayer room) on the second floor while walls crumbled around him. His only means of escape was to punch a hole through the [[asbestos]] ceiling, scramble onto the roof, and hang on until the tsunami abated.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/indonesia605/interviews.html |title=FRONTLINE/WORLD . Indonesia - After the Wave . Extended Interviews - Aceh governor, Irwandi Yusuf . PBS |publisher=pbs.org|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Out of the prison population of 278, Irwandi was one of just 40 survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Mydans, '[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/14/world/asia/14irwandi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=1d474c7adf74fa6a&amp;ex=1334203200&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss A Rebel-Turned-Governor Takes the Wheel in Indonesia'], ''The New York Times'', 14 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the tsunami, [[Free Aceh Movement|GAM]] and the Indonesian central command negotiated a peace settlement, and Irwandi renounced his [[Separatism|separatist agenda]]. No longer in conflict with the [[Politics of Indonesia|Indonesian government]], the former rebel liaised with the international [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] whose presence paved the way for Aceh's first democratic election in almost 30 years. It was a landslide victory for Irwandi, who won 39.3% of the popular vote, as announced by [[Public Issue Network]] (JIP) and [[Indonesian Survey Circle]] (LSI).&lt;ref name="suaramerdeka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0612/12/nas02.htm |title=Suara Merdeka – Nasional |publisher=suaramerdeka.com|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took office in 8 February 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Irwandi Dilantik, KSAD Tak Datang |url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-738358/irwandi-dilantik-ksad-tak-datang |accessdate=26 July 2018 |work=detiknews |date=5 February 2007 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established a normal relationship with the army that once pursued him as a GAM rebel. In an unusual move for a former revolutionary, he kept much of the old administration in place although he also moved to reform a range of positions in the senior ranks of the provincial public service. In a 2007 [[New York Times]] interview, Irwandi said, "I tell them, 'I believe, I trust you all. You are all trustworthy until you prove otherwise. Then I will know.'" In the same interview, he remarked that his former enemies in the cabinet were welcome to 'rock and roll' with him – "Rock and roll... That means to do something new, rocky, that was never felt before. It is spirit. Spirited people. Young blood. Young spirit."&lt;ref name="Seth Mydans, op. cit."&gt;Seth Mydans, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; His first term expired on 8 February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Irwandi Yusuf 'letakkan' jabatan Gubernur Aceh |url=https://news.okezone.com/read/2012/02/10/447/573641/irwandi-yusuf-letakkan-jabatan-gubernur-aceh |accessdate=26 July 2018 |work=Okezone |date=10 February 2012 |language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later he lost his reelection run against [[Zaini Abdullah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=KIP Aceh Tetapkan  Zaini-Muzakir Sebagi Pemenang Pilkada|url=http://sp.beritasatu.com/home/kip-aceh-tetapkan-zaini-muzakir-sebagi-pemenang-pilkada/19210 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |work=Suara Pembaruan |date=18 April 2012 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, he was arrested by the [[Corruption Eradication Commission]], after allegedly having caught red-handed receiving bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gubernur Aceh Ditangkap KPK,  Kasus Kedua Serambi Mekkah? |url=http://www.beritasatu.com/satu/499484-gubernur-aceh-ditangkap-kpk-kasus-kedua-serambi-mekkah.html |accessdate=3 July 2018 |work=Berita Satu |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental issues==

One of Governor Irwandi's declared priorities was the protection of Aceh's magnificent [[rainforest]]. "This is my obsession, since a long time ago – that Aceh is Aceh, and the forests of Aceh need to be kept well." His first step as a green governor was to embrace the establishment of [[carbon trading]] in [[Aceh]] using the [[Clean Development Mechanism|''REDD'' mechanism]], (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) to reinvigorate the faltering economy and prevent further destruction of Aceh's rainforests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0312-aceh_merrill_lynch.html Merrill Lynch invests $9M in rainforest conservation, expects profit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mongabay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0207-carbon_conservation.html |title=Conservation news &amp;#8211; Environmental science and conservation news &amp;#124; First rainforest-for-carbon-credits deal becomes a reality |publisher=news.mongabay.com|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irwandi declared a moratorium on all logging in Aceh in March 2007,&lt;ref name="worldwatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5179 |title=Aceh Governor Imposes Logging Ban &amp;#124; Worldwatch Institute|publisher=worldwatch.org|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and personally drove out to villages to conduct spot inspections of former logging camps, encouraging the locals to take up sustainable new professions.&lt;ref name="Seth Mydans, op. cit."/&gt;

However, in 2011, Irwandi's apparent pro-environmental efforts were abruptly halted and reversed. He allegedly surprised supporters when information was uncovered that, on 25 August 2011, he had quietly granted a concession to palm oil supplier [[PT Kallista Alam]] which authorised the destruction of a peat swamp forest that is one of the last refuges of the critically endangered Sumatran orangutan.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bachelard, '[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/credits-lost-in-tangle-of-acehs-forest-20120608-201gl.html  Credits lost in tangle of Aceh's forest'], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 9 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the indigenous peoples took the about-face from the so-called 'Green Governor' personally, calling it a betrayal of their homeland and of his previous environmental credentials.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/hei-fi/entertainment/the-rebel-leader-hero-who-has-betrayed-acehs-orangutans-6297368.html|title=The rebel leader hero who has 'betrayed' Aceh's orang-utans &amp;#124; hei-fi-entertainment &amp;#124; hei-fi &amp;#124; The Independent|publisher=independent.co.uk|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a legal level, though, many environmental organisations argued that Irwandi's decision breached a presidential moratorium – part of an international deal to save Indonesia's forests – as well as legislation protecting a conservation area where the Tripa swamp is located. Litigation was filed by environmental groups known as WAHLI, challenging the legality of this concession and contending it was granted in an area of protected forest and further violated a moratorium on peatlands conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Fakhrururradzie Gade, '[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/09/irwandi-yusuf-indonesias-_n_1138426.html Irwandi Yusuf, Indonesia's 'Green Governor', Allows Prime Jungle to be Cleared for Palm Oil'], ''Huff Post Green'', 9 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2012, on the eve of the WAHLI case being heard in court, over seventy illegally set fires mysteriously broke out in this protected Tripa swamp area, including fires set in the oil palm concession granted by Irwandi to PT. Kallista Alam.&lt;ref name="news.mongabay.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2012/0327-tripa_hotspots.html|title=Fires raging in peat forest at center of legal case in Indonesia &amp;#8211; Conservation news|publisher=news.mongabay.com|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flickr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/carlosquilesfoto/sets/72157629680326167/|title=Flickr - Photo Sharing!|publisher=secure.flickr.com|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many involved with the WAHLI litigation believed the fires were set in direct defiance of the pending litigation, in effect ignoring any eventual ruling on the alleged legality of Irwandi's granted concession.&lt;ref name="news.mongabay.com"/&gt; Mainstream media outlets and environmental organisations report that these fires could lead to the imminent and immediate extinction of the animal inhabitants of the Tripa swamp, including over 200 orangutans.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/28/us-indonesia-environment-idUSBRE82R0NK20120328|title=Orangutans in Indonesia's Aceh forest may die out in weeks &amp;#124; Reuters|author=Reuters Editorial|publisher=reuters.com|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="endoftheicons.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endoftheicons.wordpress.com/|title=End of the Icons &amp;#124; Please support our International Day of Action with your photo! #SaveLeuserEcosystem www.endoftheicons.org|publisher=endoftheicons.wordpress.com|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2012, the Council of Judges of the Banda Aceh National Administrative Court dismissed the WALHI case on jurisdictional grounds. WALHI was expected to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bachelard, '[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/indonesian-court-backs-palm-oil-company-over-orangutans-and-carbon-storage-20120403-1wau2.html Indonesian court backs palm oil company over orangutans and carbon storage'], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 4 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The court acknowledged that the permit that Irwandi approved allowing PT Kallista Allam to convert the Tripa peat swamp into palm oil plantations was indeed located inside the protected Leuser Ecosystem and thus in violation of current Indonesian law.&lt;ref name="digitaljournal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/322328|title=Op-Ed: Indonesia court ruling on palm oil case is a cop out|publisher=digitaljournal.com|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some legal observers considered the lack of a decision by the court as a case of inappropriate behaviour because it refused to reach a ruling even though the case had been running for nearly five months.&lt;ref name="endoftheicons.wordpress.com"/&gt;

Irwandi had spoken out amid the considerable attention that emerged in the wake of the Tripa peat swamp fires and the WALHI litigation. In reports on 5 April 2012, Irwandi claimed that the land grant, while legal, was 'immoral' yet intended by him to bring world attention to global inability to tackle global climate change, in effect destroying the Tripa forests to save them.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bachelard, '[http://www.theage.com.au/world/former-aceh-chief-denies-orangutans-died-in-burn-20120405-1wff4.html Former Aceh chief denies orangutans died in burn'], ''The Age'', 6 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Irwandi was quoted as saying, "That concession, 1,600 hectares, was like a pinch to the international community. Maybe I will make a threat to lift the moratorium [entirely] to make them look at Aceh."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; He also denied that any orangutans had died in the fires despite evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, after Irwandi had left office, the apparent over-exploitation of the Tripa forest area continued to attract comment. In July 2012 it was reported that officials from the national Environment Ministry who visited the Tripa area said that there were 'strong indications' that deliberate burning had been taking place in the region to convert the area to an oil palm plantation,&lt;ref&gt;Sita W. Dewi, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/10/graft-suspected-palm-oil-conversion.html-0 Environment: Graft suspected in palm oil conversion'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 10 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August 2012, judges of the Higher Administrative Court in Medan granted the WAHLI appeal, casting further doubt on Yusuf's one-time claims to be the "Green Governor."  The ruling contained among other things:  1) the granting of the WALHI appeal; 2)cancellation of the contested Tripa license issued by the Governor of Aceh (then Yusuf) on 25 August 2011; 3) an order to the current governor of Aceh to withdraw the contested State Administrative Decision issued by Yusuf on the plantation permit to PT. Kalista Alam issued on 25 August 2011; 4) and an order that the Defendants jointly cover the cost of both court process.&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endoftheicons.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/press-release-judges-of-higher-adminisrative-court-in-medan-granted-walhi-acehs-appeal/|title=PRESS RELEASE: JUDGES OF HIGHER ADMINISRATIVE COURT IN MEDAN GRANTED WALHI ACEH’S APPEAL &amp;#124; End of the Icons|publisher=endoftheicons.wordpress.com|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aceh election in 2012==
{{Main|Acehnese gubernatorial election, 2012}}

On 9 April 2012 Irwandi lost the re-election campaign that would have allowed him to continue as governor of Aceh.&lt;ref name="speroforum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speroforum.com/a/IZKXCBMCRI46/70952-Indonesia---Aceh-chooses-new-governor-Zaini-Abdullah-ahead-according-to-exit-polls|title=Indonesia: Aceh chooses new governor, Zaini Abdullah ahead according to exit polls|publisher=speroforum.com|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irwandi claimed voter fraud and voter intimidation was the cause of his loss.&lt;ref&gt;Hotli Simandjuntak and Nani Afrida, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/11/irwandi-claims-foul-play-during-poll-plans-court-date.html Irwandi claims foul play during poll, plans court date'], '' The Jakarta Post'', 11 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zaini Abdullah]],
the new governor of Aceh elected to replace Irwandi, took office on 25 June 2012. Zaini, then 72, was the former GAM foreign minister in exile in Sweden before the signing of the 2005 Indonesian government-GAM peace agreement in Helsinki. Deputy Governor Muzakir Manaf, then 48, was the former commander of GAM's Armed Wing.

Despite a guarantee from incoming deputy governor Muzakir Manaf that Irwandi's safety would be guaranteed if he attended the inauguration of the new provincial government in June 2012, following the event Irwandi was surrounded and beaten about the face and head by uniformed Aceh Party supporters. He was accused of being a traitor to GAM, the Acehnese militia, because of his negotiations and compromises with the Indonesian government. Irwandi's own governorship campaign in 2006 had been as an independent candidate, not with his former rebel comrades, a fact exploited by the Aceh Party (PA) during the 2012 election campaign to sway popular opinion in their direction. Irwandi stated that the PA's propaganda implying that he betrayed GAM was the cause of the attack by party supporters. Only one arrest was made.&lt;ref&gt;Farouk Arnas, '[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/lawandorder/acehs-ex-governor-irwandi-fears-for-safety-after-assault/527729 Aceh's Ex-Governor Irwandi Fears for Safety after Assault'], ''The Jakarta Globa'', 1 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===''American Idol''===

====Overview====
Durbin had previously auditioned for ''American Idol'' in Season 8, but was not chosen.&lt;ref name="santacruzsentinel"/&gt;

Durbin was eliminated in the Top 4 on season 10, but despite his elimination, he received a homecoming previously reserved for Top 3 contestants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/17/news/la-trb-american-idol-james-durbin-05201116  |title='American Idol' rocker James Durbin returns home for Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk concert. |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=May 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011 |first=Brady |last=MacDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first time such an exception on the homecoming policy was made by the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.priyo.com/international/2011/05/14/american-idol-will-let-james-d-25924.html  |title='American Idol' will let James Durbin homecoming in Santa Cruz go on |publisher=Priyo Internet Life |date=May 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Footage of his homecoming, dubbed the "Durbin Day",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_18091384   |title=Durbinomics gives Santa Cruz businesses a boost |publisher=Santa Cruz Sentinel |date=May 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831122418/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_18091384 |archivedate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shown briefly on the Top 3 performance show.

She was noted for her performances in films including ''[[Uphaar]]'' (1971), ''[[Koshish]]'' (1972) and ''[[Kora Kagaz]]'' (1974), among others. She appeared alongside her husband Amitabh Bachchan in films such as ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973), ''[[Abhimaan (1973 film)|Abhimaan]]'' (1973), ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'' (1975), ''[[Mili (1975 film)|Mili]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975).

Following her marriage to actor [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and the birth of their children, Bachchan restricted her work in films. After her appearance in the ''[[Silsila (1981 film)|Silsila]]'' (1981), she took an indefinite sabbatical from films. She returned to acting with [[Govind Nihalani]]'s ''[[Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa]]'' in 1998. Since then, she has appeared in several critically and commercially successful films such as ''[[Fiza]]'' (2000), ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001) and ''[[Kal Ho Naa Ho]]'' (2003), all which garnered her critical acclaim, as well as several awards and nominations.

== Career ==
Jaya Bachchan, an [[Alumnus|alumna]] of the [[Film and Television Institute of India]], started her career with a supporting role in [[Satyajit Ray]]'s Bengali film, ''[[Mahanagar]]''(1963) at the age of 15, with [[Anil Chatterjee]] and [[Madhabi Mukherjee]]. After that, she had appeared in two Bengali films: a 13-minute short film, ''Suman'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rudraa.com/main/Master_b&amp;w.htm Suman (35mm / B&amp;W / 13 min)]&lt;/ref&gt; and a Bengali comedy [[Dhanyee Meye]] (1971), as [[Uttam Kumar]]'s sister-in-law.&lt;ref name=da&gt;[[#Da|Dawar, p. 56]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by her experience with Ray, she decided to join the [[Film and Television Institute of India]] (FTII), [[Pune]] to learn acting, and passed  with the gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 526]]&lt;/ref&gt; She was also picked out to play the eponymous role of ''Guddi'' in the 1971 [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] film, ''[[Guddi (1971 film)|Guddi]]'' in which she played a schoolgirl obsessed with film star [[Dharmendra]].&lt;ref name=ba&gt;[[#Ba|Banerjee, p. 93]]&lt;/ref&gt; Guddi was a success,&lt;ref name=da/&gt; and she moved to Mumbai and soon picked other roles, however her role of a 14-year-old schoolgirl, aided by her petite looks, created the [[Girl next door|girl-next-door]] image for her, which she was often associated with through the rest of her career. Though she tried to break out of the mould with glamorous roles as in ''[[Jawani Diwani]]'', (1972)&lt;ref name="Gulzar, p. 457"&gt;[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 457]]&lt;/ref&gt; and a negative character of the heroine faking amnesia, in ''[[Anamika (1973 film)|Anamika]]'' (1973), she was mostly recognised for roles of the sort which were credited with epitomising middle-class sensibility, which she played amiably in films of "middle-cinema" directors such as [[Gulzar]], [[Basu Chatterjee]] and indeed [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 91]]&lt;/ref&gt; These films include ''[[Uphaar]]'' (1971), ''[[Piya Ka Ghar]]'' (1972), ''[[Parichay (film)|Parichay]]'' (1972), ''[[Koshish]]'' (1972) &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jaya Bhaduri in Jawani Diwani, 1972 film.jpg|thumb|196x196px|Jaya Bachan in Jawani Deewnai (1972)]] --&gt; and ''[[Bawarchi]]'' (1972), performed with marked sensitivity.&lt;ref name="ba" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 396]]&lt;/ref&gt; By now, she was a popular star.&lt;ref name="da" /&gt;

In Gulzar's ''Koshish'' (1973), Bhaduri and [[Sanjeev Kumar]] played a deaf couple who struggle through their difficulties as handicapped people. She described the film as "a learning experience" which motivated her to do social work in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=23 August 1998|newspaper=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|title=I will not allow anyone to dictate terms to me|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98aug23/sunday/head.htm|accessdate=2011-09-19|author=Maheshwari, Belu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She first acted with her future husband [[Amitabh Bachchan]] in the film ''[[Bansi Birju]]'' (1972), followed by [[B.R. Ishara]]'s ''[[Ek Nazar]]'' also in the same year.&lt;ref name=da/&gt; Amitabh had undergone a string of flops, and when most lead heroines refused to work with him in the [[Salim-Javed]] scripted ''Zanjeer'' (1973), she stepped into the film. The film turned out to be a hit and gave rise to Amitabh Bachchan's angry-young-man image.&lt;ref name="gr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1070422/asp/7days/story_7680318.asp|title=Another time, another wedding|date=22 April 2007|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was closely followed by their pairing in films such as ''[[Abhimaan (1973 film)|Abhimaan]]'' (1973), ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975).
[[File:Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan still5.jpg|thumb|left| Jaya Bachchan with her husband [[Amitabh Bachchan]]]]
Her daughter Shweta was born while Jaya and Amitabh were working on ''[[Sholay]]''. Following this, she retired from films and focused on raising her children. Her last film as a lead actress was ''[[Silsila]]'' (1981), opposite her husband. During the late 1980s, she wrote the story for the film ''[[Shahenshah (1988 film)|Shahenshah]]'' (1988), which starred her husband in the lead.

After a gap in film appearances of 18 years, she returned to acting with [[Govind Nihalani]]'s ''[[Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa]]'' (1998), a film about the [[Naxalite]] movement.  In 2000 she starred in ''[[Fiza]]'' for which she received the [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award]] for her work. She also starred in [[Karan Johar]]'s family drama ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001) with her husband. She then starred in Karan Johar's next film, ''[[Kal Ho Naa Ho]]'' (2003) playing the role of [[Preity Zinta]]'s mother, Jennifer Kapur, for which she again received a [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Bollywood Hungama]]|title=Jaya Bachchan – Awards|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/celebrities/awards/8466/index.html|accessdate=2010-06-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922041736/http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/celebrities/awards/8466/index.html|archivedate=22 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared with her son Abhishek in the films ''[[Laaga Chunari Mein Daag]]'' (2007) and ''[[Drona]]'' (2008).

In 2011, she appeared in the Bangladeshi film ''[[Meherjaan]]'' starring with [[Victor Banerjee]] and [[Humayun Faridi]]. The film is based on a Bangladesh-Pakistan love story in the backdrop of the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities]]. It is the story of Meherjaan (played by Jaya Bachchan), a Bangladeshi woman who falls in love with a Pakistani army officer, who refuses to join the war and saves her from being raped by other Pakistani troops, who do not however spare her cousin Neela and kill her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pakbangla-love-flick-starring-jaya-bachchan-ready-for-release/739983/ |title=Pak-Bangla love flick starring Jaya Bachchan ready for release |publisher=Indian Express |date=20 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
Bachchan was first elected in 2004 as the [[Member of Parliament]] from the [[Samajwadi Party]], representing [[Uttar Pradesh]] in the [[Rajya Sabha]] till March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jaya Bachchan loses Rajya Sabha seat|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Jaya-Bachchan-loses-Rajya-Sabha-seat/articleshow/1440067.cms|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She got a second term from June 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jaya Bachchan back in Rajya Sabha|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/jun/08profit.htm|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; till July 2010 and in February 2010 she stated her intent to complete her term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I'm too upfront for politics: Jaya Bachchan |publisher= ''[[The Times of India]]'' |date=3 February 2010 |author=IANS |accessdate=2010-06-29 |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/Im-too-upfront-for-politics-Jaya-Bachchan/articleshow/5531466.cms |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100602093730/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/Im-too-upfront-for-politics-Jaya-Bachchan/articleshow/5531466.cms |archivedate=2 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=December 2012|reason=Why would she have to state such intent?

== Controversies ==
Bachchan's speech during the musical launch of the film ''Drona'' in the second half of 2008 was criticized by some sections of politicians in [[Maharashtra]]. In response to the film's director, Goldie Behl, making his introductory speech in English, she said "Hum [[Uttar Pradesh|UP]] ke log hain, isliye [[Hindi]] mein baat karenge, [[Maharashtra]] ke log maaf kijiye". (We are from [[Uttar Pradesh|UP]], so we will speak in Hindi. People of [[Maharashtra]], please excuse us.) Subsequently, she encouraged actress [[Priyanka Chopra]] to speak in [[Hindi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2008/sep/08video1.htm |title=rediff.com: Jaya Bachchan's controversial clip |publisher=Specials.rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maharashtra Navnirman Sena]] (MNS) president [[Raj Thackeray]] commented that Jaya had no business alluding to all the people of Maharashtra in that statement. He threatened to ban all Bachchan films unless Jaya apologized in a public forum for hurting Maharashtrians. MNS workers began to attack theaters screening ''[[The Last Lear]]'' starring her husband, Amitabh Bachchan. [[Shiv Sena]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] Sanjay Raut also criticized her statement saying: "After making all your success and fortune in Mumbai, if you feel like saying that we are from UP, it's very unfortunate." Amitabh Bachchan tendered an apology for her statements on her behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/sep/11raj.htm |title=Raj Thackeray: I accept Amitabh's apology |publisher=Rediff.com |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurupira''' is a figure in [[Guaraní mythology]].  He is one of the seven monstrous children of [[Tau (mythology)|Tau]] and [[Kerana]], and as such is one of the central legendary figures in the region of [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] speaking cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guarani-raity.com/html/mitologia.html|title=Mitologia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512163642/http://www.guarani-raity.com/html/mitologia.html|archivedate=2007-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also one of the few figures still prominent in the modern culture of the region.
== Myths ==
Kurupi is said to be somewhat similar in appearance to another, more popular figure from Guaraní [[mythology]], the [[Pombero]]. Like the Pombero, Kurupi is said to be short, [[Ugliness|ugly]], and hairy. He makes his home in the wild forests of the region, and was considered to be the lord of the forests and protector of wild animals. Kurupi's most distinctive feature, however, was an humongous [[penis]] that was ordinarily wound several times around his waist like a belt.  Due to this feature, he was at one time revered by the Guaraní as the [[spirit]] of [[fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ateneoguarani.edu.py/index.php?content=personajes_mitologicos|title=Personajes Mitológicos|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527005143/http://www.ateneoguarani.edu.py/index.php?content=personajes_mitologicos|archivedate=2007-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like the Pombero, Kurupi is often blamed for unexpected or unwanted pregnancies. His penis is said to be prehensile, and owing to its length he is supposed to be able to extend it through doors, windows, or other openings in a home and impregnate a sleeping woman without even having to enter the house.  Together with the Pombero, Kurupi was a scapegoat used by adulterous women to avoid the wrath of their husbands, or by single women to explain their pregnancies. Children fathered by the Kurupi were expected to be small, ugly and hairy much like their father, and if male to inherit something of their father's virility. In some cases, Kurupi is blamed with the disappearance of young women, supposedly stealing them away to his home in the forest for use in satiating his libidinous desires (rape).

The legend of Kurupi has faded somewhat in comparison to the [[Pombero]], and figures more often as part of old tales. Rarely is he blamed with impregnating women anymore, although he is sometimes used to try and frighten young girls into being chaste.

She made a name for herself as the author of a much-read [[memoir]] of her famous father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=John Seely |authorlink=John Seely Hart |date=1872 |title=A Manual of English Literature: A Text Book for Schools and Colleges |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4p8XAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22lady+holland%22&amp;pg=PA458#v=onepage |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=Eldredge &amp; Brother |page=458 |accessdate=2014-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[https://archive.org/details/revsydneysmith01smitrich/page/n5 ''A Memoir of the Reverend Sydney Smith'', Vol. 1 (of 2)] (1856)}}

Some of Smith's often-quoted sayings were first recorded in Lady Holland's memoir, including:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Why, you never expected justice from a company, did you? They have neither a soul to lose, nor a body to kick.''&lt;ref name="AndersonWaggoner2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James M.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Thank God for tea! What would the world do without tea? How did it exist? I am glad I was not born before tea.

Colonel '''Luis Florentino Juan Manuel Silvestre de los Dolores de la Carrera y Verdugo''' (1791 – April 8, 1818) was a [[Chile]]an military officer who fought in the [[Chilean War of Independence]]. Together with his brothers [[José Miguel Carrera|José Miguel]] and [[Juan José Carrera|Juan José]], they were some of most important leaders of Chilean struggle for independence during the period of the [[Patria Vieja]] ("Old Republic"). The [[Carrera family]] is of [[Basque people|Basque]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://diario.elmercurio.cl/detalle/index.asp?id={09b31ebd-bb5c-419c-87c7-3069540a13e3}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Luis Carrera was born in [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], the youngest son of [[Ignacio de la Carrera|Ignacio de la Carrera y Cuevas]] and of Francisca de Paula Verdugo Fernández de Valdivieso y Herrera. Carrera completed his first studies at the ''[[Convictorio Carolino]]'', the best school in the country at the time. In 1813 – at the beginning of the [[Chilean War of Independence]] – he participated in the first encounter between the Patriot and Royalist troops at the [[Battle of Yerbas Buenas]], as a commander of an artillery platoon. That same year he also participated in the disastrous [[Siege of Chillán]], one of the most negative early experiences for the nascent [[Chilean Army]], where after a long siege of the Spanish troops that were barricaded inside the city, the army had to withdraw in the midst of winter that same year. He also fought in the defense of Talca.

After the Spanish ''[[Reconquista (Spanish America)|reconquista]]'', the Carrera brothers were exiled to Argentina but continued campaigning from exile. On November 21, 1814 he killed Brigadier [[Juan Mackenna]], one of the strongest supporters of General [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], in a duel in the city of [[Buenos Aires]]. He was arrested and tried but later freed. Eventually, Luis was taken prisoner and executed in the city of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] together with his brother [[Juan José Carrera|Juan José]] by the military of the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] in 1818.

'''Mabel Hyde Kittredge''' (September 19, 1867 – May 7, 1955) was an early 20th century home economist and [[social worker]] who is best known as a crusader for school-lunches and an author of books on household management.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=fg/&gt;

==Early years==
Kittredge was born in [[Boston]], Massachusetts on September 19, 1867.&lt;ref name=WANMEC/&gt; She was the daughter of the well-known and well-to-do Presbyterian pastor [[Abbott Eliot Kittredge]]. She was raised in New York City and lived there for most of her adult life.

As a teenager she studied at [[Miss Porter's School]] in Farmington, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mabel Hyde Kittredge, 1867-1955: Her Book|date=June 10, 1956|location=Bass River, Cape Code, Mass.|edition=Memorial address by Dr. Charles W. Gilkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kittredge advocated for [[school lunches]] and started the hot-lunch program in [[New York City]] public schools in 1901.&lt;ref name=WANMEC/&gt; Afterwards, she continued develop the program for the next two decades, finally succeeding in getting it funded by the Board of Education in 1920.&lt;ref name=sl/&gt;

Kittredge helped to financially support the [[Henry Street Settlement]] founded by her close friend [[Lillian Wald]], and even lived at the settlement briefly in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=cc/&gt;

Kittredge became a household adviser because she believed in the importance of the home in national life and because she was shocked by the conditions in which many immigrants lived.&lt;ref name=sl/&gt;&lt;ref name=es/&gt; Like [[Christine Frederick]], she aimed to improve household management in the United States, with a focus on making better, safer food and furnishings available to women with little money and teaching them up-to-date household management techniques.&lt;ref name=sl/&gt;

Under the umbrella title Association of Practical Housekeeping Centers, she established the first of several "model flats" in a New York City tenement in 1902, declaring: "If household administration is to take its place in the front rank with the other professions of the day, educators as well as women must wake up and realize that the whole housekeeping question is dependent upon scientific management, efficiency, skilled labor, and effective tools."&lt;ref name=es/&gt;

Her 1911 book ''Housekeeping Notes: How to Furnish and Keep House in a Tenement Flat'' was a compendium of household management lessons taught in these centers, and  her 1918 book ''The Home and Its Management'' offered practical advice on thrift in furnishing a home as well as in shopping for daily necessities. She became the most famous home economist (also known then as home adviser) of her day.&lt;ref name=sl/&gt;

In 1915, she attended the International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom at the [[Hague]]. She went overseas during World War I, working for [[Herbert Hoover]] and for the [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]], heading up the child-feeding program in France and Belgium. She saw her work for the war effort as analogous to her work on household management: both were forms of national service. Papers relating to Kittredge's work with the Commission for Relief in the period 1915-18 are held by the Hoover Institution Archives in [[Stanford, California]].&lt;ref name=oac/&gt;

* ''Practical Homemaking; a Textbook for Young Housekeepers'' (1914)

{{Nihongo|'''Dr. Hal Emmerich'''|ハル・エメリッヒ|Haru Emerihhi}}, nicknamed {{Nihongo|'''Otacon'''|オタコン|Otakon}}, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from [[Konami]]'s [[Metal Gear|''Metal Gear'' series]]. Created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], Otacon was introduced in the series in ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]''.

In ''Metal Gear Solid'', Otacon, an ArmsTech employee who designed [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Metal Gear REX|Metal Gear REX]], becomes a close ally of [[Solid Snake]] upon learning of REX's nuclear strike capabilities. After the events of ''Metal Gear Solid'', he helped Solid Snake form [[Philanthropy (Metal Gear)|Philanthropy]], a group whose main objective is to prevent proliferation of [[Metal Gear (weapon)|Metal Gear]]-type weapons. Snake and Otacon infiltrate the military installations and facilities of the world, delving into their compounds through stealth and cyber hacking. In a sense, Snake is the brawn and Otacon is the brains behind "Philanthropy."

A devoted fan of [[anime]], Hal's chosen nickname is the short form of the [[Otaku]] Convention, with reference to [[Otakon]] held in [[Washington, D.C.]] each year. The name "Hal" is a direct reference to the computer [[HAL 9000]] from the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', one of several references to the film which is present in ''Metal Gear Solid''; in the Otacon ending of the game, Hal and Snake make direct comparisons to the film. Critical reception of Otacon has been positive, with praise being particularly directed towards his and Snake's friendship.

==Concept and design==
"Hal" is a tribute to ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name="Making"&gt;{{cite game|title=The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2|year=2002|developer=Kojima Productions|publisher=Konami|level=Making of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kojima states that he created Otacon as his way of glorifying the [[otaku]] stereotype by having a character who fights the terrorists with his intellect rather than his brawn.&lt;ref name=mgsagavol1&gt;{{cite video|title=Metal Gear Saga Vol. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the original idea for Otacon was to make him "heavier, wearing a cap, and programming while eating a chocolate bar". However, the design Shinkawa did for the character was a slender one instead.&lt;ref name=mgs1handbook&gt;{{cite book|title=Metal Gear Solid: Official Mission Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead character designer Yoji Shinkawa stated in an interview that Otacon was designed to look somewhat "tougher" than he did in ''Metal Gear Solid'' for the [[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty|second game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Colin Williamson|date = 12 December 2000|accessdate = January 1, 2007|url= http://ps2.ign.com/articles/088/088856p1.html|title = Yoji Shinkawa interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
Hal Emmerich was born in 1980 to [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Huey|Dr. "Huey" Emmerich]] and [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove]], a pair of former scientists. When Hal was still young, Huey attempted using him as a test pilot for the [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Sahelanthropus|Metal Gear ST-84]], as the machine could only be piloted by a child. Strangelove vehemently opposed this, leading to an argument between Hal's parents and ultimately to his mother's death at his father's hands. Years later, Huey married a British woman named Julie Danziger with a child of her own ([[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Emma Emmerich|Emma]]). Hal and Emma were close, as they had no other friends. Hal was sexually abused by his stepmother, and she coerced him into keeping a brief affair. Upon learning this, Huey committed suicide by drowning himself in the family pool, and attempted to drown Emma as well. Emma expected Hal to save her, but he didn't know it was happening since at the time he was with his stepmother. After the incident, Emma became estranged from her stepbrother, blaming him for not saving her. Shortly afterwards, Hal ran away from home and didn't see any of his family members until several years later. Choosing not to continue school, he began to educate himself via the Internet. He became a big fan of [[anime]], and started calling himself Otacon, short for the "[[Otaku]] Convention", which he never misses. He [[matriculation|matriculated]] at [[MIT]] and earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Princeton University]]. During his college years, he was recruited by the [[FBI]]'s Engineering Research Facility, but was fired from his job after hacking into their classified database. Otacon was hired by Armstech, Inc. to be the lead engineer for the Metal Gear REX project.&lt;ref&gt;"Snakes and Gears: A Metal Gear Overview," ''Game Informer'' 182 (June 2008): 108.&lt;/ref&gt; He jumped at the chance to make an actual [[mecha]] type robot, which appears frequently in the anime he enjoys. He was led to believe that it was a mobile defense system, but in reality it was a nuclear [[doomsday weapon]]. 

In 2005, during the Shadow Moses incident (the events of ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]''), Otacon encountered [[Solid Snake]], who had informed him of the true nature of Metal Gear REX. Devastated, Otacon realized that he had written yet another chapter in his family's dark history—his grandfather had worked on the [[Manhattan Project]], and his father was born on the day of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima bombing]]. Otacon had developed a strong attraction to [[FOXHOUND]] member [[Sniper Wolf]]. Distraught that Snake would have to kill her, Otacon eventually came to terms with her, himself, and his position in life. With Otacon's assistance, Snake was able to destroy Metal Gear REX and defeat the terrorist uprising. According to the in-universe novel ''In the Darkness of Shadow Moses: The Unofficial Truth'' in ''Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty'', Otacon had allegedly left for Great Britain after the events of the terrorist uprising to visit relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite game|title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty|developer=[[Konami|KCEJ]]|quote="[...]Dr. Hal Emmerich did not return to ArmsTech following his rescue from Shadow Moses. His whereabouts are unknown, but there is some indication that he made his way to England where he has family members."}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the schematics for Metal Gear were placed on the black market by [[Revolver Ocelot]], Snake and Otacon formed Philanthropy, an organization dedicated to the end of the proliferation of Metal Gear-type weapons.

In 2007, prior to the events of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'', Otacon received an email from his step sister, Emma, informing him of a new Metal Gear prototype codenamed [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Metal Gear RAY|RAY]]. The e-mail was actually a bait for [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#The Patriots|the Patriots]] to lure Snake out of hiding and frame him for terrorism, by having Ocelot hijack RAY and place the blame on Snake with forged evidence. When the tanker was destroyed by Ocelot, Otacon took a boat and managed to save Snake, as well as [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Olga Gurlukovich|Olga Gurlukovich]]. Otacon was forced to fake Snake's death after he was framed by the Patriots. Using connections he had with an organization, he managed to steal [[Liquid Snake]]'s corpse (which was missing its right arm) and dumped it into the sea. He continued to manage Philanthropy's activities, while keeping Snake's survival a secret from the public.

In 2009, he received another anonymous e-mail, this time from Liquid (while taking over Ocelot's mind), informing him about the development of Arsenal Gear in the Big Shell. When Solidus seized the Big Shell, he infiltrated the facility with SEAL Team 10 to find Emma, who was among the hostages. He managed to be reunited with her, but she died shortly afterwards, due to stab wounds inflicted by [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Vamp|Vamp]]. Before her death, Emma admitted to always admiring Hal and wanting to follow in his footsteps. Despite falling into deep despair, Snake encouraged him to move on and rescue all the hostages held in the Big Shell. Apparently he was successful in this, and stays in contact to support [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]] until he defeated [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Solidus Snake|Solidus]]. When Snake met Otacon at their hideout he was given the disk that contained the data of the Wisemen's Committee to look over, which included their names and whereabouts. After this (the ending note) Otacon told Solid Snake about the information on the disc: the twelve Wisemen had been dead for about 100 years.

Otacon appeared once more as Snake's support man in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', set in 2014. He and Olga's daughter, [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Sunny|Sunny]], built a robotic companion to Snake called [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Metal Gear Mk. II and Metal Gear Mk. III|Metal Gear Mk. II]], which he controlled remotely. The Mk. II was taken from a robotic character of the same name in ''[[Snatcher (video game)|Snatcher]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.konami.jp/kojima_pro/event2007/index-en.html |title=Kojima Productions event site 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-24 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became romantically involved with [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Naomi Hunter|Naomi Hunter]] through the course of the story although he once again lost her upon her suicide, thus forcing him yet again to witness the death of a woman he cared about. In the finale, Otacon told Snake that he will live with Snake for the remainder of his life, to serve as witness of his existence. By the time of ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'' in 2018, Otacon is mentioned to have officially adopted Sunny.

Outside of the ''Metal Gear'' series, Otacon made a guest appearance in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', where he was one of Snake's support crew available through taunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheatcc.com/wii/supersmashbrosbrawlcheatscodes.html#.UXXGkrXvs_g|title=Super Smash Bros. Brawl|publisher=Cheat Code Central|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Otacon is widely regarded as one of the best [[sidekick]] type characters in video games. As such, he was declared the best "buddy in gaming" by [[Machinima.com]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Machinima|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4ZOdMRaSx4 |title=Top 10 Best Buddies in Gaming|publisher=YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cracked.com]] included him on their 2010 list of six video game sidekicks that are actually more effective than the actual hero at number four, stating: "Really, Otacon doesn't need Snake at all. The only thing keeping us from ''Metal Gear Solid: Nerdy Mouthbreather'' is the fact that Otacon pees all over himself when he's scared and has sex with his stepmother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=David |url=http://www.cracked.com/article_18870_6-video-game-heroes-made-useless-by-supporting-characters.html |title=6 Video Game Heroes Made Useless By Supporting Characters |publisher=Cracked.com |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[UGO Networks]] ranked him the sixth best video game companion, comparing him to [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] of [[James Bond]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Saathoff |first=Evan |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/best-video-game-companions?page=2 |title=Best Video Game Companions |publisher=UGO.com |date=2011-11-23 |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307012853/http://www.ugo.com/games/best-video-game-companions?page=2 |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Maximum PC]]'' listed him among 25 of gaming's greatest sidekicks, commenting that "Snake wouldn’t be half the man he is without Otacon backing him up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/thanks_buddy_25_gamings_greatest_sidekicks#slide-19 |title=Thanks Buddy!: 25 of Gaming's Greatest Sidekicks |publisher=Maximum PC |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Hanuman Welch of ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' ranked Otacon and [[Meryl Silverburgh]] ''ex equo'' at fourth place on a list of video game sidekicks that deserve their own titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complex.com/video-games/2013/07/13-video-game-sidekicks-that-deserve-their-own-titles/mg 13 Video Game Sidekicks That Deserve Their Own Titles], Complex.com, July 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[GameSpot]]'s poll "All-Time Greatest Game Sidekick", Otacon got to the semi-finals, before losing to [[Albert Einstein]] of the ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert series|Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/greatest-video-game-sidekick/standings/index.html?tag=content_nav%3Bsubnav%3Bresults |title=All-Time Greatest Game Sidekick- Current Standings |publisher=GameSpot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Otacon was ranked the fourth best ''Metal Gear'' character by ''[[Play (UK magazine)|Play]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.play-mag.co.uk/features/top-ten-metal-gear-characters/|title=Top 10 Best Metal Gear characters|author=Smith, Sam|work=[[Play (UK magazine)|Play]]|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1UP.com]]'s Scott Sharkey ranked Otacon's reaction to the death of Sniper Wolf at second place in his 2009 list of the series' "most awkward" moments, calling it "the world's most embarrassingly stupid case of [[Stockholm syndrome]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/features/metal-gear-top-5-awkward |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019163635/http://www.1up.com/features/metal-gear-top-5-awkward |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 19, 2012 |title=Metal Gear's Top 5 Awkward Moments from |publisher=1UP.com |author=Scott Sharkey |year=2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other reception, Marissa Meli of UGO placed him at third place on her 2010 list of the greatest Jewish characters in video games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meli |first=Marissa |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/the-greatest-jews-in-video-games?page=4 |title=The Greatest Jews in Video Games |publisher=UGO.com |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ryan Woo of ''Complex'' ranked him as the sixth most stylish video game character for his ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' outfit in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2011/09/the-25-most-stylish-video-game-characters/19&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''Complex'' also put him and Solid Snake at second place on their list of "Most A**-Kicking Video Game Duos",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/10/the-25-most-a-kicking-video-game-duos/snake-and-otacon|title=The 25 Most A**-Kicking Video Game Duos|date=October 5, 2012|author=Vincent, Brittany|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ScrewAttack]] ranked Otacon tenth on their [[ScrewAttack's Top 10|top list of "P#$$y @$$ B!tche$ in Gaming"]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ScrewAttack|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlHfrWWggSM |title=Top 10 P#$$y @$$ B!tche$ in Gaming &amp;#124; ScrewAttack |series=''[[ScrewAttack's Top 10]]'' |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2012-09-27 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GamesRadar]] included him among the "13 unluckiest bastards in gaming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mikel Reparaz|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-13-unluckiest-videogame-bastards/ |title=The 13 unluckiest bastards in gaming |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2012-04-13 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1901 to 1904 Hannon was Director of the [[Irish Agricultural Wholesale Society]] and reported on agriculture worldwide. From 1902 to 1907 he visited the United States and Canada on behalf of the [[Irish Industrial Movement]]. From 1907 to 1909 he was Director of Agricultural Organisation to the government of [[Cape Colony]] and a [[Justice of the Peace]].

[[File:Statue of Jan Breydel and Pieter de Coninck 03.JPG|thumb|Statue of [[Jan Breydel]] and Pieter de Coninck in [[Bruges]], Belgium]]

'''Pieter de Coninck''' (died 1332 or 1333) was a weaver from [[Bruges]] well known for his role in the events surrounding the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]]. He was not the head of the weavers' guild as is popularly believed (mostly because he was portrayed as such in the novel ''[[De Leeuw van Vlaanderen (book)|The Lion of Flanders]]'' by [[Hendrik Conscience]]).  Together with [[Jan Breydel]], a butcher, he was in the forefront of the popular uprising that led to the Battle of the Golden Spurs. Right before that battle he was [[knight]]ed together with two of his sons. 

Before the Battle of the Golden Spurs began he was seen by the city government of [[Bruges]] as a dangerous [[agitator]] and was imprisoned in June 1301. He was freed by the people of Bruges. Afterwards, the ''Leliaarts'', a political faction supporting French rule,  took over control of the city. [[Jacques de Châtillon]], the then appointed [[governor]] of [[Flanders|County of Flanders]], entered Bruges with a small force and de Coninck was banished.

Urged on by [[John I, Marquis of Namur]], de Coninck restored his authority in Bruges in December 1301. He tried to align the people of [[Ghent]] on the same side but failed. On 1 May 1302 he was one of the leaders of a gang of rebels who took the [[castles|castle]] of Sijsele and Male. At Male, the rebels killed the entire French garrison. De Châtillon responded by again marching on Bruges with a force of 800 men, and again expelling de Coninck from the city.  De Châtillon marched into the city with his army fully clad and battle-ready (against established agreements with the city magistrates) The people of Bruges, fearing bloody preprisals, and in order to protect themselves helped de Coninck to enter the city with his followers during the night. On 18 May 1302, during the so-called [[Bruges Matins (history)|Bruges Matins]] or "''Brugse Metten''", nearly all the French present in Bruges and their ''Leliaart'' supporters were killed. De Châtillon barely managed to escape.

After the Bruges Matins, de Coninck was one of the leaders of the Bruges militia that cleared the coastal area from ''Leliaart'' insurgents and French stragglers. After they failed to take  the besieged castle of [[Cassel, France|Cassel]], they marched onto [[Kortrijk]] (Courtrai) where a Flemish makeshift army was gathering to stop a French army under the command of [[Robert II of Artois]]. This battle, won by a motley alliance of Flemish and Namur petty nobles and many commoners, was later famously called the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]].

In 1309, together with [[Jan Breydel]] and [[Jan Heem]], he led a new uprising in Bruges, this time against the adverse effects (for Flanders) of the [[treaty of Athis-sur-Orge|peace of Athis-sur-Orge]] (1305). In 1321 he again took part in an uprising in Bruges. As a punishment all his possessions were confiscated and sold.

Pieter de Coninck was married twice. He died in 1332 or 1333. Together with Jan Breydel he has a statue on the market of Bruges. It was put up in 1887.

Dr '''Reginald John Gladstone''' [[FRSE]] FRCS LRCP MZS (1865&amp;ndash;1947) was a British anatomist and embryologist. As he suffered from bilateral [[congenital cataract]]s his career was limited mainly to educational fields and research. He took a special interest in deformities of the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;http://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk/biogs/E004190b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

He was born on 9 June 1865 in [[Clapham]], the third and youngest son of Dr Thomas H. Gladstone DPH and his wife Matilda Field (daughter of [[Joshua Field (engineer)|Joshua Field]]). His father died when he was six and the family then moved to [[Aberdeen]]. He studied Medicine at [[Aberdeen University]] graduating MB CM DPH in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Anatomy, April 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

He undertook his clinical training at [[Middlesex Hospital]] as house physician and surgeon. Aberdeen gave him his doctorate (MD) in 1894. In 1895 he became an Anatomy Demonstrator at the hospital and in 1896 became Senior Demonstrator. He made study trips to both [[Vienna]] and [[Vancouver]] (the latter representing the [[British Medical Association]]) to increase his knowledge of embryology.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Anatomy, April 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Arthur Robinson (anatomist)|Arthur Robinson]], [[Joseph Strickland Goodall]], [[John Cameron (anatomist)|John Cameron]], and [[David Waterston (anatomist)|David Waterston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 he moved to [[Kings College, London]] as a Reader and Lecturer in Anatomy (specialising in Embryology) and stayed there until retiral in 1938. When he first moved here he lived at 22 Regents Park Terrace in [[London]], a fairly prestigious address.

Up until 1941 he lived at 22 Court Lane Gardens in [[Dulwich]], a pleasant rural-ambience suburb of [[London]], but his house was destroyed by a bomb during [[The Blitz]]. He then moved to Greenhayes on Sway Road in [[Brockenhurst]].

He died on 12 February 1947.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8021">'''Richard Barlow''' is an [[United States|American]] intelligence analyst and a former senior member of the [[counter-proliferation]] desk at the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] who lost his job when he acted as a [[whistleblower]] about the [[George H. W. Bush administration]]'s misleading Congress over [[Pakistan's nuclear weapon program]]. Following several investigations, he was vindicated in 1997; unable to collect a government pension, he lives in a [[Recreational vehicle|motor home]] in [[Montana]].

==Career in government==

Barlow entered the intelligence community with two years of work at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. He then, in 1985, entered the CIA, where he collated and examined information about nuclear programs in the Third World. He worked on the [[National Intelligence Estimates]], and won the CIA's Exceptional Accomplishment Award in 1988.&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/06/AR2007070602127_pf.html The Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Barlow transferred to the [[office of the Secretary of Defense]], where he initiated an in-house intelligence analysis program. He was in a chain of command below [[Stephen J. Hadley]], then Assistant Secretary of Defense; the Secretary of Defense was [[Dick Cheney]]. His early work included an effort to sound the alarm about the now-discredited Pakistani nuclear scientist and proliferator, [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]]. In particular, he discovered that Pakistan's nuclear program depended upon clandestine and illegal procurement activity within the United States.&lt;ref name="RS"&gt;[http://rawstory.com/news/2007/They_sold_out_world_for_F16_0426.html Raw Story]&lt;/ref&gt; The US administration, however, knew that this was the case; indeed, his report detailed occasions when the [[State Department]] under [[Ronald Reagan]] had actually helped it happen, warning targets of sealed arrest warrants in FBI operations and approving export licenses for restricted goods.&lt;ref name ="RS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HT"&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=ac764737-c552-4368-a841-23be59381441&amp;MatchID1=4627&amp;TeamID1=1&amp;TeamID2=6&amp;MatchType1=1&amp;SeriesID1=1165&amp;PrimaryID=4627&amp;Headline=America+fails+the+IQ+test Hindustan Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Whistleblowing==

During the debate over the sale of [[F-16]]s to Pakistan in 1989, the U.S. administration was constrained by the 1985 [[Pressler amendment]] of the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] which prohibited the sale of any [[matériel]] or armaments which might assist in the development or delivery of nuclear weapons. Barlow's analysis of Pakistan's nuclear program indicated that Pakistan possessed the capability to use the fighters to drop nuclear bombs, and the report which he submitted to Dick Cheney concluded that the F-16 sale indisputably violated the law. He drew on details available to the intelligence community about how Pakistan had used the F-16s it already possessed.&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;

Barlow then learned that Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense [[Arthur Hughes (politician)|Arthur Hughes]] had delivered testimony to Congress that stated the exact opposite, including the statement that using F-16s to deliver nuclear weapons "far exceeded the state of art in Pakistan," which Barlow knew to be untrue. Barlow believed that the details had been "willfully falsified by officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense",&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt; including then-Undersecretary of Defense for Policy [[Paul Wolfowitz]] and then-Deputy Undersecretary of Defense [[Scooter Libby]]. On examining the archives he discovered that his reports were "mysteriously substituted or altered".&lt;ref name="HT"/&gt;

Within days of Barlow's sharing his concerns with colleagues at the Department of Defense, he was fired.&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/13/usa.pakistan Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark, Guardian UK, October 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Econ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.economist.com/node/10424283 | title=Pakistan's nuclear ambitions: The spider's stratagem | work=[[The Economist]] | date=January 3, 2008 | accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/03/29/1993_03_29_056_TNY_CARDS_000363214?printable=true Seymour Hersh in the New Yorker]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/no-sailing-against-the-wind/656627/0 |title=No sailing against the wind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events following dismissal==

Barlow brought a legal action for wrongful dismissal that received considerable attention, including from the United States Congress, where he was defended by Paul Wolfowitz, who said "there have been times on that issue when I specifically sensed that people thought we could somehow construct a policy on a house of cards that the Congress wouldn't know what the Pakistanis were doing" and that the retaliation Barlow had faced was "wrong".

Following congressionally ordered investigations, the inspector-general at the State Department concluded that Barlow had been fired as a reprisal; however, the inspector-generals at the CIA and the Defense Department stated that the Pentagon was within its rights to fire Barlow. A final investigation by Congress' own [[Government Accountability Office]] was completed in 1997 and "largely vindicated" Barlow, who had his security clearance restored.&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt; During the investigation, the State department inspector-general, [[Sherman Funk]], described Barlow as "one of the most brilliant analysts I've ever seen".&lt;ref name="ny"/&gt;

The activities of the Defense Department officials, however, including Cheney, Libby, Wolfowitz and Hadley, were never investigated. Rep. [[Stephen Solarz]], a major player in counter-proliferation, told [[Seymour Hersh]] for the latter's famous exposé of the Pakistani nuclear program that "If what Barlow says is true, this would have been a major scandal of [[Iran-Contra]] proportions, and the officials involved would have had to resign".&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ny"/&gt;

Barlow, however, was unable to find employment after his clearance was removed and marriage broke up. "They viciously tried to destroy my life, personally and professionally" he is quoted as saying. "Not just my career, but they went after my marriage, my livelihood, and smeared my name in truly extraordinary ways that no one had ever seen before or since—at least not until the [[Valerie Plame affair|Wilsons were victims of the same people]] years later." According to Barlow the allegations included the "fabrication" that he "was an 'intended' Congressional spy", that he was an alcoholic, had not paid his taxes, and was an adulterer. "Then they accused me of being psychotic and used that to invade my marital privacy, including that of my now ex-wife who also worked at the CIA, and sought to destroy my marriage as punishment."&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt;

Although he was found to have breached no national security regulations and was vindicated, Barlow did not receive his government pension and has had trouble finding employment.

Khan]], caused a sensation in 2005 when they revealed that they had tracked him down to a [[Recreational vehicle|motor home]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]] where he lived with two dogs.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

Stone officially left the Trump campaign on August 8, 2015; however, it has been reported that, as part of the ongoing investigation into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States election]], two associates of Stone have claimed he collaborated with WikiLeaks owner [[Julian Assange]] in the spring of 2016 to discredit Hillary Clinton's campaign.

==Early life and political work==
Stone was born on August 27, 1952,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/02/080602fa_fact_toobin |title=The Dirty Trickster |date=June 2, 2008 |last=Toobin |first=Jeffrey |authorlink=Jeffrey Toobin |work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name=rewp47&gt;{{cite news |last=Edsall |first=Thomas B. |title=Partners in Political PR Firm Typify Republican New Breed |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=April 7, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Gloria Rose (Corbo) and Roger J. Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thehour/obituary.aspx?n=roger-j-stone&amp;pid=163187831|title=Roger J. Stone's Obituary on The Hour|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Lewisboro, New York]], in a family of Hungarian and Italian descent. His mother was a small-town reporter, his father a well driller&lt;ref name=dswp827&gt;{{cite web |last=Segal |first=David |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/24/AR2007082402122.html |title=Mover, Shaker, And Cranky Caller? A GOP Consultant Who Doesn't Mince Words Has Some Explaining to Do |work=Washington Post |date=August 25, 2007 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and business owner. He has described his family as [[middle-class]], [[blue-collar]] Catholics.&lt;ref name=rewp47/&gt;

In the first grade, Stone claims, he broke into politics to further [[John F. Kennedy]]'s presidential campaign: "I remember going through the cafeteria line and telling every kid that Nixon was in favor of school on Saturdays&amp;nbsp;... It was my first political trick."&lt;ref name="dswp827" /&gt;

When he was a junior and vice president of student government at his high school in northern [[Westchester County, New York]], he manipulated the ouster of the president and succeeded him. Stone recalled how he ran for election as president for his senior year:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I built alliances and put all my serious challengers on my ticket. Then I recruited the most unpopular guy in the school to run against me. You think that's mean? No, it's smart.&lt;ref name=jhnyt&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoffman |first=Jan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/18/nyregion/public-lives-the-ego-behind-the-ego-in-a-trump-gamble.html |title=The Ego Behind the Ego in a Trump Gamble |work=The New York Times |date=18 November 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given a copy of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'', Stone became a convert to [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] as a child and a volunteer in [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|Goldwater's 1964 campaign]]. In 2007, Stone indicated he was a staunch conservative but with [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] leanings.&lt;ref name=dswp827/&gt;

As a student at [[George Washington University]] in 1972, Stone invited [[Jeb Magruder]] to speak at a Young Republicans Club meeting, then asked Magruder for a job with [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Committee to Re-elect the President.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Paybarah |first=Azi |date=September 7, 2007 |title=Roger Stone's Nixon Thing |url=http://www.observer.com/2007/roger-stones-tattoo-alibi |work=[[The New York Observer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magruder agreed and Stone then left college to work for the committee.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/02/the-dirty-trickster|title=The Dirty Trickster|website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1970s: Nixon campaign, Watergate and Reagan 1976===
Stone's political career began in earnest on the 1972 Nixon campaign, with activities such as contributing money to a possible rival of Nixon in the name of the [[Young Socialist Alliance]] – then slipping the receipt to the ''[[Manchester Union-Leader]]''. He also hired a spy in the [[Hubert Humphrey]] campaign who became Humphrey's driver. According to Stone, during the day he was officially a scheduler in the Nixon campaign, but "By night, I'm trafficking in the black arts. Nixon's people were obsessed with intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;http://stonezone.com/docs/WS_RS_article.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Stone maintains he never did anything illegal during [[Watergate]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

After Nixon won the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]], Stone worked for the administration in the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]]. After Nixon resigned, Stone went to work for [[Bob Dole]], but was later fired after columnist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] publicly identified Stone as a Nixon 'dirty trickster'.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post June 16, 1986 "The Rise and Gall of Roger Stone)https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1986/06/16/the-rise-and-gall-of-roger-stone/d8ce308b-7055-4666-860e-378833f46e17/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Stone helped found the [[National Conservative Political Action Committee]], a [[New Right]] organization that helped to pioneer [[independent expenditure]] political advertising.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1985/04/07/partners-in-political-pr-firm-typify-republican-new-breed/8d0b8c04-fabc-43ae-887b-25c7e8af0ec0/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, he worked in [[Ronald Reagan]]'s campaign for president. In 1977, at age 24, Stone won the presidency of the [[Young Republicans]] in a campaign managed by his friend [[Paul Manafort]]; they had compiled a dossier for each of the 800 delegates that gathered, which they called “whip books”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/paul-manafort-american-hustler/550925/|title=Paul Manafort, American Hustler|first=Franklin|last=Foer|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone went on to serve as chief strategist for [[Thomas Kean]]'s [[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 1981|campaign for governor of New Jersey in 1981]] and for his [[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 1985|re-election campaign in 1985]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Rothstein]]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Sears recruited Stone to work in Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, coordinating the Northeast. Stone said that [[Roy Cohn]] helped him arrange for [[John B. Anderson]] to get the nomination of the [[Liberal Party of New York]], a move that would help split the opposition to Reagan in the state. Stone said Cohn gave him a suitcase that Stone avoided opening and that, as instructed by Cohn, he dropped off at the office of a lawyer influential in Liberal Party circles. Reagan carried the state with 46% of the vote. Speaking after the [[statute of limitations]] for [[bribery]] had expired, Stone later said, "I paid his law firm. Legal fees. I don't know what he did for the money, but whatever it was, the Liberal party reached its right conclusion out of a matter of principle."&lt;ref name=ml/&gt;

In 1980, after their key roles in the Reagan campaign, Stone and Manafort decided to go into business together, with partner [[Charlie Black (lobbyist)|Charlie Black]], creating a [[political consulting]] and [[lobbying firm]] to cash in on their relationships within the new administration. Black, Manafort &amp; Stone (BMS), became one of Washington D.C.’s first mega-lobbying firms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=Evan |title=The Slickest Shop in Town |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960803,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 3, 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Toner |first=Robin |date=July 31, 1990 |title=Washington at Work; The New Spokesman for the Republicans: a Tough Player in a Rough Arena |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/us/washington-work-new-spokesman-for-republicans-tough-player-rough-arena.html |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was described as instrumental to the success of Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign. Republican political strategist [[Lee Atwater]] joined the firm in 1985, after serving in the #2 position on Reagan-Bush 1984.

Because of BMS’s willingness to represent brutal third-world dictators like [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the Republic of the Congo and [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in the Philippines, the firm was branded "''The Torturers’ Lobby''". BMS also represented a host of high-powered corporate clients, including [[Rupert Murdoch]]’s News Corp, [[The Tobacco Institute]] and, starting in the early 1980s, [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-donald-trump-paul-manafort-ferinand-marcos-philippines-1980s-213952|title=Paul Manafort's Wild and Lucrative Philippine Adventure|website=Politico|access-date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fara.gov/docs/3600-Exhibit-AB-19851101-D0XCT601.pdf|title=Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly, Public Affairs Company document for U.S. Department of Justice|website=U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act website (FARA.gov)|access-date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/09/25/mobutu-in-search-of-an-image-boost/d0626644-1a49-4414-82b2-70701894dfae/|title=Mobutu in Search of an Image Boost|website=Washington Post|access-date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987–88, Stone served as senior adviser to [[Jack Kemp]]'s presidential campaign, which was managed by consulting partner Charlie Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= |title=The Almanac of 1988 Presidential Politics |publisher=Campaign Hotline/American Political Network |location= |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-9621971-0-6}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In that same election, his other partners worked for [[George H.

In April 1992, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' alleged that Stone was involved with the controversial [[Willie Horton]] advertisements to aid George H. W. Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, which were targeted against [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] opponent [[Michael Dukakis]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975347,00.html |title=The Political Interest It's Not Going To Be Pretty |date= April 20, 1992 |publisher= Time Magazine |author=Michael Kerner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone has said that he urged Lee Atwater not to include Horton in the ad.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Stone denied making or distributing the advertisement, and said it was Atwater's doing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; However, the actual ads featuring Horton's picture (run originally on [[CNN]]) were produced by Americans for Bush/NSPAC (National Security PAC), an independent-expenditure group not controlled or coordinated by Atwater and the Bush campaign. FEC records for NSPAC do not indicate any payments to or affiliation with Stone, and the ads were reported in 1988 and thereafter to have been produced by another consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= |title=The Almanac of 1988 Presidential Politics |publisher=Campaign Hotline/American Political Network |location= |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-9621971-0-6}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} page 91&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Stone and Manafort sold their business. Although their careers went in different directions, their relationship remained close.

Stone married his first wife Anne Elizabeth Wesche in 1974. Using the name Ann E.W. Stone, she and Stone founded the group [[Republicans for Choice]] in 1989. They divorced in 1990.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===1990s: early work with Donald Trump, Dole 1996===
In 1995, Stone was the president of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Arlen Specter]]'s campaign for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Holmes |first=Steven A. |date=November 10, 1995 |title=96 Aspirants Filling Breach Left By Powell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/10/us/96-aspirants-filling-breach-left-by-powell.html |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specter withdrew early in the campaign season with less than 2% support.

Stone was for many years a lobbyist for [[Donald Trump]] on behalf of his [[casino]] business&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duffy |first1=Michael |last2=Cooper |first2=Matthew |date=September 20, 1999 |title=Take my party, please |url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/1999/09/20/trump.html |publisher=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also was involved in opposing expanded casino gambling in [[New York State]], a position that brought him into conflict with Governor [[George Pataki]].&lt;ref name=tomasky /&gt;

In 1996, Stone resigned from a post as a consultant on Senator [[Bob Dole]]'s campaign for president after ''[[The National Enquirer]]'' wrote that Stone had placed ads and pictures in racy swingers' publications and a website seeking sexual partners for himself and his second wife, Nydia Bertran Stone, whom he married in Las Vegas in 1992. Stone initially denied the report.&lt;ref name=dswp827/&gt;&lt;ref name=jhnyt/&gt; On the ''[[Good Morning America]]'' program he stated, "An exhaustive investigation now indicates that a domestic employee who I discharged for substance abuse on the second time that we learned that he had a drug problem is the perpetrator who had access to my home, access to my computer, access to my password, access to my postage meter, access to my post-office box key."&lt;ref name=dswp827/&gt; In a 2008 interview with ''The New Yorker'' Stone admitted that the ads were authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Toobin |first1=Jeffrey |date=June 2, 2008 |title=The Dirty Trickster |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/02/080602fa_fact_toobin?currentPage=all |publisher=The New Yorker }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s: Florida recount, Killian memos, conflict with Eliot Spitzer===
In 2000, Stone served as campaign manager of Donald Trump's aborted [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000|campaign for president]] in the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] primary.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; Investigative journalist [[Wayne Barrett]] accused Stone of persuading Trump to publicly consider a run for the Reform nomination to sideline [[Pat Buchanan]] and sabotage the Reform Party in an attempt to lower their vote total to benefit George W.

Later that year, according to Stone and the film ''[[Recount (film)|Recount]]'', Stone was recruited by [[James Baker]] to assist with public relations during the [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|Florida recount]]. His role in the [[Brooks Brothers riot]], the demonstration by Republican operatives against the recount, remains controversial.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

In 2002, Stone was associated with the campaign of businessman [[Thomas Golisano]] for governor of New York State.&lt;ref name=tomasky&gt;{{cite web |last=Tomasky |first=Michael |date=June 17, 2002 |title=The Right Stuff |url=http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/politics/columns/citypolitic/6153/ |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York Metro]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential campaign]], Democrat [[Al Sharpton]] responded to accusations that Stone was working on his campaign, stating, "I've been talking to Roger Stone for a long time.

During the 2004 general election, Stone was accused by then-DNC Chairman [[Terry McAuliffe]] of forging the [[Killian documents controversy|Killian memos]] that led CBS News to report that President Bush [[George W. Bush military service controversy|had not fulfilled his service obligations]] while enlisted in the Texas Air National Guard. McAuliffe cited a report in the ''[[New York Post]]'' in his accusations.

In 2007, Stone, a top adviser at the time to [[Joseph Bruno]] (the [[Majority Leader of the New York State Senate]]), was forced to resign by Bruno after allegations that Stone had threatened [[Bernard Spitzer]], the then-83-year-old father of Democratic gubernatorial candidate [[Eliot Spitzer]].&lt;ref name="HakiPoliticsSeen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=timesresign&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hakim |first1=Danny |last2=Confessore |first2=Nicholas |author2link=Nicholas Confessore |date=August 23, 2007 |title=Political Consultant Resigns After Allegations of Threatening Spitzer's Father |newspaper=The New York Times |page=B1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/23/nyregion/23stone.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 2007, an expletive-laced message was left on the elder Spitzer's answering machine threatening to prosecute the elderly man if he did not implicate his son in wrongdoing. Bernard Spitzer hired a private detective agency that traced the call to the phone of Roger Stone's wife. Roger Stone denied leaving the message, despite the fact that his voice was recognized, claiming he was at a movie that was later shown not to have been screened that night. Stone was accused on an episode of ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'' on August 22, 2007 of being the voice on an expletive-laden voicemail threatening Bernard Spitzer, father of Eliot, with subpoenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnicle |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Barnicle |date=August 23, 2007 |title=August 22nd transcript |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20408966/ |work=Hardball with Chris Matthews |publisher=MSNBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=assumed to be Roger Stone |date=August 2007 |title=Bernard Spitzer's voicemail |url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/audio/nyregion/20070821_voicemail.mp3 |format=MP3 |medium=voicemail |publisher=The New York Times |quote=And there's not a goddamn thing your phony, psycho, piece-of-shit son can do about it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Trump]] is quoted as saying of the incident, "They caught Roger red-handed, lying.

Stone consistently denied the reports. Thereafter, however, he resigned from his position as a consultant to the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee at Bruno's request.&lt;ref name=timesresign /&gt;

In January 2008, Stone founded Citizens United Not Timid, an anti-[[Hillary Clinton]] [[527 group]] with an intentionally [[Cunt|obscene acronym]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Labash |first=Matt |date=January 28, 2008 |title=Making Political Trouble: Roger Stone shows how its done–again|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/617oiaek.asp|magazine=The Weekly Standard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone is featured in ''[[Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story]]'', documentary on Lee Atwater made in 2008. He also was featured in ''[[Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer]]'', the 2010 documentary of the [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal]].

In February 2012, Stone said that he had changed his party affiliation from the Republican Party to the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].

Stone considered running as a [[Libertarian Party of Florida|Libertarian]] candidate for governor of Florida in 2014, but in May 2013 said in a statement that he would not run, and that he wanted to devote himself to campaigning in support of a [[Florida Amendment 2 (2014)|2014 constitutional amendment on the Florida ballot to legalize medical marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Caputo, "[http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/roger-stone-why-i-wont-run-for-florida-governor/2123241 Roger Stone: Why I won't run for Florida governor]", ''Miami Herald'' (May 27, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Stone has repeatedly acknowledged that he had established a back-channel with WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]] to obtain information on [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-stone-donald-trump-julian-assange_us_58bc24cae4b0d2821b4ec16c|title=Former Trump Adviser Roger Stone Admits Collusion with WikiLeaks, Then Deletes It|first=Marina|last=Fang|date=March 5, 2017|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miami.cbslocal.com"/&gt; Stone has pointed to this intermediary as the source for his advance knowledge about the release of Podesta's e-mails by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/roger-stone-dnc-hacker-guccifer-russia-trump-2017-9|title=Top Trump confidant points to dubious report to justify conversation with Russian cyber spy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone ultimately named [[Randy Credico]], who had interviewed both Assange and Stone for a radio show, as his intermediary with Assange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raju|first1=Manu|last2=Herb|first2=Jeremy|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/29/politics/randy-credico-roger-stone-wikileaks/index.html|title=New York radio personality was Roger Stone's WikiLeaks contact|publisher=CNN|date=November 29, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that as part of its ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign, the FBI was looking into any contacts Stone may have had with Russian operatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html|title=Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence|first1=Michael S. Schmidt, Mark|last1=Mazzetti|first2=Matt|last2=Apuzzo|date=February 14, 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, after reports surfaced in ''[[The Washington Times]]'' that Stone had direct-messaged alleged DNC hacker [[Guccifer 2.0]] on Twitter, Stone admitted to having contact with the mysterious persona and made public excerpts of the messages. Stone claimed the messages were just innocent praise of the hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/12/politics/stone-guccifer-2-0-messages/index.html|title=Trump associate plays down Twitter contact with Guccifer 2.0|first=Gloria Borger and Matt|last=Korade|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a publicly released report by U.S. intelligence agencies, the U.S. intelligence community believes Guccifer 2.0 to be a false persona created by Russian intelligence to obscure its role in the DNC hack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-38610402|title=Conversations with a hacker: What Guccifer 2.0 told me|date=January 14, 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guccifer 2.0 persona has since been linked with an IP address believed to originate at the Russian intelligence agency, GRU, in Moscow; apparently this was discovered by the FBI when a user with a Moscow IP address logged into one of the Guccifer social media accounts without using a VPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/dnc-lone-hacker-guccifer-2-0-pegged-as-russian-spy-after-opsec-fail/|title=DNC “lone hacker” Guccifer 2.0 pegged as Russian spy after opsec fail|author=|date=|website=arstechnica.com|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the Senate Intelligence Committee asked Stone to preserve all documents related to any Russian contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/us/politics/roger-stone-senate-trump-russia-documents.html|title=Senators Ask Trump Adviser to Preserve Any Russia-Related Documents|first=Maggie|last=Haberman|date=March 18, 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee Vice Chair, Senator [[Mark Warner]], called on Stone to testify before the committee, saying he "hit the trifecta" of shady dealings with Russia. Stone denied any wrongdoing in an interview on ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' on March 31, 2017, and claimed he was willing to testify before the committee.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt;

On September 26, 2017, Stone testified before the [[House Intelligence Committee]] behind closed doors, but he released a public statement which he had delivered to the Committee shortly before, and supplied to the media afterwards. The Washington Post noted his affiliations with [[Infowars]], [[Breitbart (website)|Breitbart]], and [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories]] promulgator, [[Jerome Corsi]]. Stone also made personal attacks on Democratic committee members [[Adam Schiff]], [[Eric Swalwell]] and [[Dennis Heck]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/09/26/roger-stones-defiant-congressional-testimony-on-trump-and-russia-annotated/ Roger Stone’s defiant congressional testimony on Trump and Russia, annotated], ''[[Washington Post]]'', Callum Borchers, September 26, 2017. Retrieved January 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2017, Stone became agitated following a news report by CNN that indictments would be announced within a few days. Subsequently, Stone's Twitter account was [[List of people banned from Twitter|suspended by Twitter]] for what it called "targeted abuse" of various CNN personnel in a series of derogatory, threatening and obscenity-filled tweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Ryan|title=Roger Stone suspended from Twitter|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/10/28/roger-stone-twitter-suspended/810593001/|date=October 29, 2017|work=USA Today|accessdate=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2018, two sources close to Stone, former Trump aide [[Sam Nunberg]] and a person speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged to the Washington Post that Stone had established contact with WikiLeaks owner Julian Assange and that the two had a telephone conversation discussing emails related to the Clinton campaign which had been leaked to WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name=stoneassange /&gt; According to Nunberg, who claimed he spoke to the paper after being asked to do so by Special Counsel Robert Mueller,&lt;ref name=stoneassange /&gt; Stone joked to him that he had taken a trip to London to personally meet with Assange, but declined to do so, had only wanted to have telephone conversations to remain undetected and did not have advance notice of the leaked emails.&lt;ref name=stoneassange /&gt; The other source, who spoke on anonymity, stated that the conversation occurred before it was publicly known that hackers had obtained the emails of Podesta and of the Democratic National Committee, documents that WikiLeaks released in late July and October.&lt;ref name=stoneassange /&gt; Stone afterwards denied that he had contacted Assange or had known in advance about the leaked emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/13/politics/roger-stone-wikileaks-contact/index.html|title=Stone denies report that he had contact with Assange in 2016|first=Maegan Vazquez,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Stone's social media consultant, Jason Sullivan, was issued grand jury subpoenas from the [[Mueller investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mueller/mueller-issues-grand-jury-subpoenas-to-trump-advisers-social-media-consultant-idUSKCN1IH2OB |title=Mueller issues grand jury subpoenas to Trump adviser's social media consultant |author=Mark Hosenball |date=May 16, 2018 |publisher=Reuters |access-date=May 17, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-16/mueller-turns-his-focus-to-longtime-trump-adviser-roger-stone |title=Mueller Turns His Focus to Longtime Trump Adviser Roger Stone |authors=Shannon Pettypiece, Billy House, and Kevin Cirilli |date=May 16, 2018 |publisher=Bloomberg |access-date=May 17, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2018, U.S. District Court Judge Ellen Huvelle dismissed a lawsuit brought by political activist group Protect Democracy, alleging that Donald Trump's campaign and Stone conspired with Russia and WikiLeaks to publish hacked Democratic National Committee emails during the 2016 presidential election race. The judge found that the suit was brought in the wrong jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/03/trump-dnc-hacking-693965|title=Judge tosses suit alleging Trump campaign conspired with Russia in DNC hack|author=|date=|website=politico.com|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/judge-dismisses-suit-trump-campaign-roger-stone-conspired-russia-wikileaks-hack-dnc|title=Judge dismisses suit alleging Trump campaign conspired with Russia to hack DNC|author=|date=July 4, 2018|website=washingtonexaminer.com|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, in July 13, the anonymous person mentioned in the indictment released by Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]], which [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)#Viktor Netyksho, et al.|charged twelve]] [[GRU|Russian military intelligence]] officials with conspiring to interfere in the 2016 elections, as somebody the Russian hackers operating by means of the online persona [[Guccifer 2.0]] communicated with, and who the indictment alleged ″was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign″ was identified by two government officials as Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/mueller-indictment-russian-intelligence-hacking.html|title=12 Russian Agents Indicted in Mueller Investigation|author=Mark Mazzetti and Katie Benner|date=July 13, 2018 |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=July 14, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books and other writings==
Since 2010, Stone has been an occasional contributor to the conservative website ''[[The Daily Caller]]'', serving as a "male fashion editor".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycaller.com/author/rogerstone/ Archive of Stone's columns] at ''The Daily Caller''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pappu"&gt;Sridhar Pappu, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/fashion/roger-stone-rides-donald-trumps-well-tailored-coattails.html Roger Stone Rides Donald Trump's Well-Tailored Coattails], ''New York Times'' (August 26, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Stone also writes for his own fashion blog, ''Stone on Style''.&lt;ref name="Pappu"/&gt;

Stone has written five books, all published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]] of New York City.&lt;ref name="DCorn"&gt;[[David Corn]], "[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/roger-stone-book-trump-bill-clinton-hillary-rapist Trump's No. 1 Booster Goes Real Dirty to Attack the Clintons: With his new book and video project, can Roger Stone get any lower?]", ''Mother Jones'' (September 18, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Stone's books have been described as "hatchet jobs" by the ''[[Miami Herald]]''&lt;ref name="GarvinBooks"/&gt; and ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''.&lt;ref name="SmithBook"&gt;Adam C. Smith, "[http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/roger-stones-book-on-bush-crime-family-coming--soon/2260177 Roger Stone's book on 'Bush crime family' coming soon]", ''Tampa Bay Times'' (January 6, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ'' (with Mike Colapietro contributing) ([[Skyhorse Publishing]], 2013): Stone contends that [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was behind a conspiracy to [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|kill John F. Kennedy]] and was complicit in at least six other murders.&lt;ref name="Freedlander"/&gt; In a review for ''[[The Washington Times]]'', [[Hugh Aynesworth]] wrote: "The title pretty much explains the book's theory. If a reader doesn't let facts get in the way, it could be an interesting adventure."&lt;ref name="Aynesworth"&gt;{{cite news |last=Aynesworth |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Aynesworth |date=February 25, 2014 |title=Nook Review 'The Man Who Killed Kennedy' |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/25/book-review-the-man-who-killed-kennedy/?page=all |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aynesworth, who covered the assassination for the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', said that the book "is totally full of all kinds of crap".&lt;ref name="GarvinBooks"/&gt;
* ''Nixon's Secrets: The Rise, Fall and Untold Truth about the President, Watergate, and the Pardon'' (Skyhorse Publishing, 2014): Stone discusses [[Richard Nixon]] and his career. About two-thirds of the book "is a conventional biography that is by no means a whitewash of Nixon. Stone writes that the president took campaign money from the mob, had a long-running affair with a Hong Kong woman who may have been a Chinese spy, and even once unwittingly smuggled three pounds of marijuana into the United States when carrying the suitcase of jazz great [[Louis Armstrong]]." The remaining one-third of the book is an unconventional account of the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref name="GarvinBooks"&gt;Glenn Garvin, "[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article2766816.html Hatchet job: Roger Stone’s edgy takes on history and politics]", ''Miami Herald'' (October 14, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Stone portrays Nixon as a "confused victim" and claims that [[John Dean]] orchestrated the break-in (which he depicts as ordinary politics of the time&lt;ref name="Schwab"&gt;Nikki Schwab, "[https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/10/22/roger-stone-thinks-richard-nixon-had-a-mistress Did Richard Nixon Have a Mistress?]", ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' (October 22, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;) to cover up involvement in a prostitution ring. This account is rejected by experts, such as Watergate researchers [[Anthony Summers]] and [[Max Holland]]. Holland said of Stone: "He's out of his ever-lovin' mind."&lt;ref name="GarvinBooks"/&gt; Dean said in 2014 that Stone's book and his defense of Nixon are "typical of the alternative universe out there" and "pure bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;Joe Strupp, "[http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/08/19/former-nixon-counsel-john-dean-right-wing-media/200472 Former Nixon Counsel John Dean: Right-Wing Media Impeachment Calls, Watergate Comparisons 'Absolutely Silliness']", Media Matters of America (August 19, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Clintons' War on Women'' (with [[Robert Morrow (Texas politician)|Robert Morrow]] of Austin, Texas) (Skyhorse Publishing, 2015): This book, according to ''[[Politico]]'', is a "[[Sensationalism|sensational]]" work that contains "explosive, but highly dubious, revelations about both [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]]", with a focus on [[Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations]], and a claim that [[Webster Hubbell]] is the biological father of [[Chelsea Clinton]]. This book was promoted by Trump, who posted a Twitter message containing the book's Amazon.com page.&lt;ref name="StoneBook"&gt;Nick Hass, "[http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/donald-trump-roger-stone-controversial-clinton-book-214790 Trump embraces sensational anti-Clinton book by former aide Roger Stone]", ''Politico'' (October 14, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Corn]], writing in ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', writes that the book is "apparently designed to smear the Clintons—by depicting Bill as a serial rapist, Hillary as an enabler, and both members of the power couple as a diabolical duo bent on destroying anyone who stands in their way" and said that the book was part of a wider "extreme anti-Clinton project" by Stone.&lt;ref name="DCorn"/&gt;
* ''Jeb! and the Bush Crime Family'' (with Saint John Hunt) (Skyhorse Publishing, 2016): The book focuses on [[Jeb Bush]] and the [[Bush family]].&lt;ref name="SmithBook"/&gt;
* ''The Making of the President 2016: How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution'' (Skyhorse Publishing, 2017): The book discusses [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griffiths|first1=Brent|title=Roger Stone to write Trump campaign book|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/roger-stone-trump-campaign-book-232058|accessdate=December 7, 2016|work=POLITICO|date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Stone's Rules: How to win at Politics, Business, and Style'' (Skyhorse Publishing, 2018): The book is Stone's "operating manual" on a variety of topics and areas of life from success in business and politics to Stone's personal style of men's clothing to his recipe for Sunday gravy. Some of these rules are seen in the documentary ''[[Get Me Roger Stone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stone Cold Truth, " [https://stonecoldtruth.com/rogerstonesrules/]", Stone Cold Truth.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal style and habits==
Stone has been noted for his personal style, described as flamboyant.&lt;ref&gt;Slackman, Michael, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/25/us/the-2004-campaign-the-consultant-sharpton-s-bid-aided-by-an-unlikely-source.html The Consultant: Sharpton's Bid Aided by an Unlikely Source], ''New York Times'' (January 25, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Cwik, [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/donald-trump-and-top-adviser-roger-stone-split.html Donald Trump and Top Adviser Roger Stone Split as Campaign Turmoil Intensifies], ''New York'' (August 8, 2015) ("Stone, a legendary political operator known for his colorful tactics and flamboyant persona...).&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' profile written by [[Matt Labash]], Stone was described as a "lord of mischief" and the "boastful black prince of Republican sleaze."&lt;ref name=ml/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prokop"&gt;Andrew Prokop, [https://www.vox.com/2015/7/28/9061029/donald-trump-roger-stone A top Donald Trump adviser either just quit or was just fired] (August 8, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Labash wrote that Stone "often sets his pronouncements off with the utterance 'Stone's Rules,' signifying to listeners that one of his shot-glass commandments is coming down, a pithy dictate uttered with the unbending certitude one usually associates with the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]." Examples of Stone's Rules include "Politics with me isn't theater. It's performance art, sometimes for its own sake."&lt;ref name=ml/&gt;

Stone does not wear socks—a fact that [[Nancy Reagan]] brought to her husband's attention during his [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980|1980 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Stuart, and Binder, David, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/11/us/washington-talk-briefing-sockless-strategist.html Washington Talk: Briefing; Sockless Strategist], ''New York Times'' (August 11, 1988) ("'I told him, "I'm not wearing socks until the Soviets are out of Afghanistan,"' Mr. Stone recalled. 'I had to say something, and that answer seemed acceptable to Governor Reagan.'").&lt;/ref&gt; Labash described him as "a dandy by disposition who boasts of having not bought off-the-rack since he was 17," who has "taught reporters how to achieve perfect double-dimples underneath their tie knots."&lt;ref name="Prokop"/&gt; Washington journalist [[Victor Gold (journalist)|Victor Gold]] has noted Stone's reputation as one of the "smartest dressers" in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Victor, "Hail to the tie", ''San Antonio Express-News'', February 17, 1994/.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone's longtime tailor is [[Alan Flusser]]. Stone dislikes single-vent jackets (describing them as the sign of a "heathen"); says he owns 100 silver-colored neckties; and has 100 suits in storage.&lt;ref name=ml/&gt; Fashion stories have been written about him in ''[[GQ]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''.&lt;ref name=ml/&gt; Stone has written of his dislike for jeans and [[Ascot tie|ascots]] and has praised [[seersucker]] [[three-piece suit]]s, as well as [[Madras (cloth)|Madras]] jackets in the summertime and velvet blazers in the winter.&lt;ref name="Pappu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedlander"&gt;David Freedlander, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/14/roger-stone-s-new-book-solves-jfk-assassination-johnson-did-it.html Roger Stone's New Book 'Solves' JFK Assassination: Johnson Did It!], ''Daily Beast'' (May 14, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Stone credited his preternatural looks to "decades of following a regimen of Chinese herbs, breathing therapies, tai chi and acupuncture," according to the ''Times''.&lt;ref name=jhnyt/&gt; Stone wears a diamond pinkie ring in the shape of a horseshoe and in 2007 he had Richard Nixon's face tattooed on his back.&lt;ref name=ml/&gt; As of 2007, he owned five [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar cars]] and five [[Yorkshire Terrier]]s.&lt;ref name=ml/&gt; In 2016, he claimed in a ''Newsweek'' interview that at least two of his dogs have been poisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nina Burleigh|url=http://www.newsweek.com/lunch-roger-stone-513214|title=A Revealing Lunch with Roger Stone|date=October 24, 2016|newspaper=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said: "I like English tailoring, I like Italian shoes. I like French wine. I like vodka martinis with an olive, please. I like to keep physically fit."&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Andrew, "Golisano's Not-So-Secret Weapon / Adviser lobs political bombs", ''Newsday,'' September 23, 2002, accessed via Newsbank.com subscription archive April 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone's office in Florida has been described as a "Hall of Nixonia" with framed pictures, posters, and letters associated with Nixon. Exceptions are a poster of a stripper and a photo of him standing by a pool with a bikini-clad [[pornographic film actress]], [[Nina Hartley]].&lt;ref name=ml/&gt;

{{See also|Names of the Serbs}}

This article features the '''naming culture''' of '''[[personal name]]s''' of [[Serbs|ethnic Serbs]] and the [[Serbian language]]. Serbian names are rendered in the "Western name order" with the surname placed after the given name. "Eastern name order" may be used when multiple names appear in a sorted list, particularly in official notes and legal documents when the last name is capitalized (e.g. MILOVANOVIĆ Janko).

==Given names==

As with most European cultures, a child is given a [[first name]] chosen by their parents or is chosen by [[godparent]]s. The given name comes first, the surname last, e.g. "Željko Popović", where "Željko" is a first name and "Popović" is a family name.

Serbian first names largely originate from [[Slavic names|Slavic roots]]: e.g. [[Slobodan]], [[Miroslav (given name)|Miroslav]], [[Vladimir (name)|Vladimir]], [[Zoran]], [[Lubomir (given name)|Ljubomir]], [[Vesna (name)|Vesna]], [[Radmila]], [[Dragan]], [[Milan (given name)|Milan]], [[Goran (Slavic name)|Goran]], [[Radomir (given name)|Radomir]], [[Vukašin]], [[Miomir]], [[Branimir]], [[Budimir (disambiguation)|Budimir]]; see also [[Slavic names]], or the [[:sr:Списак словенских имена|list of Slavic names in the Serbian Wikipedia]])

Some may be non-Slavic but chosen to reflect [[Christianity|Christian]] faith. Names of this nature may often originate from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for Biblical reasons. Christian names include: e.g. [[Nikola]], [[Ivan (name)|Ivan]], [[Jovan]], [[Maria (given name)|Marija]], [[Anna (given name)|Ana]], Mihailo. Along similar lines of non-Slavic names among Christians, the origins for many such names are [[Greeks|Greek]]: e.g. [[Aleksandar]], [[Andrej]], [[Teodora]], [[Jelena (disambiguation)|Jelena]], [[Sophia_(name)|Sofija]], [[Katarina (given name)|Katarina]], [[Nikola]], [[Đorđe]], [[Stefan (given name)|Stefan]], [[Petar]], [[Vasilije]], [[Todor]]. Names of [[Latin]] origin include: e.g. [[Marko (given name)|Marko]], [[Angela_(given_name)|Anđelka]], [[Anthony (given name)|Antonije]], [[Paul (name)|Pavle]], [[Srđan]], [[Marina (given name)|Marina]], [[Natalia (given name)|Natalija]], Kornelije. Names of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin, entering through Russian, include: e.g. [[Igor (given name)|Igor]], [[Oliver (given name)|Oliver]], [[Olga (name)|Olga]].

In Serbian naming culture, apotropaic names (''zaštitne ime'', "protective names") include [[Vuk (name)|Vuk]] (and its many derivatives), [[Nenad]], [[Prodan]], [[Sredoje]], [[Staniša]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grković|first=Milica|title=Rečnik ličnih imena kod Srba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1D9CAQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Vuk Karadžić|location=Belgrade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surnames==

Most '''Serbian surnames''' have the surname suffix ''[[-ić]]'' (-ић) ({{IPA-sh|itɕ|}}). This can sometimes further be transcribed as ''-ic'', but in history, [[Serbs|Serbian]] names have often been transcribed with a phonetic ending, -ich or -itch.

This form is often associated with Serbs from before the early 20th century: hence [[Milutin Milanković]] is usually referred to, for historical reasons, as Milutin Milankovitch, and [[Mileva Marić]], born in [[Vojvodina]] (then a part of Hungary) has sometimes been rendered as Marity (e.g. in the claim of "Einstein-Marity" theory).

The [[-ić|-ić suffix]] is a Slavic diminutive, originally functioning to create patronymics. Thus the surname [[Petrović]] means the little son of Petar (Petrić signifies the little son of Petra, the widow).

Most Serbian surnames are paternal (father), maternal (mother), occupational, or derived from personal traits.

Other common surname suffixes are ''-&lt;u&gt;ov&lt;/u&gt;'', ''-&lt;u&gt;ev&lt;/u&gt;'', ''-&lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt;'' and ''-&lt;u&gt;ski&lt;/u&gt;'' (also -cki/čki/ški) which is the Slavic [[genitive case|possessive case]] suffix, thus Nikola's son becomes Nikolin, Petar's son Petrov, and Jovan's son Jovanov. The two suffixes are often combined, most commonly as -ović. Other, less common suffices are ''-alj/olj/elj'', ''-ija'', ''-ica'', ''-ar/ac/an'', .

When marrying, the woman most often adopts her husband's family name, though she can also keep both of her last names or not change her last name at all.

It is estimated that some two thirds of all Serbian surnames end in -ić. The ten most common surnames in Serbia, in order, are [[Jovanović]], [[Petrović]], [[Nikolić]], [[Marković]], [[Đorđević]], [[Stojanović]], [[Ilić]], [[Stanković]], [[Pavlović]] and [[Milošević]].&lt;ref name=Politika&gt;http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/U-Srbiji-najvise-Jovanovica-Petrovica-i-Nikolica.lt.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Serbian countries, Slavic suffixes have been transliterated. [[Serbs in Hungary]] have the endings -ity -ics -its, [[Serbs in the Republic of Macedonia|Serbs in R. Macedonia]] -ikj (iḱ, иќ), and [[Serbs in Romania]] -ici.

==History==
The names of Serbian rulers thru [[Mutimir]] are [[Slavic dithematic names]], as per Old Slavic tradition, until the 9th century and Christianization after which Christian names appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=SANU|title=Glas|volume=377-381|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLcrAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti|page=37|quote=&lt;!-- [p. 37:] У лозама ста- росрпских кнежева, или архоната како их зову грчки извори, то ]е надэастушьениди узорак: Вишеслав, Радослав, Просиго], Властимир, Хвалимир, Мутимир (тада, у IX веку, име се ]0ш изговарало са наза- лом: ...--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Demetrios Chomatenos]] ([[Archbishop of Ohrid]] from 1216 to 1236) registered the naming culture of the [[South Slavs]] in [[Byzantine lands]]. In the 11th and 12th century, family names became more common and stable in Byzantium, adapted by the majority of people in [[Byzantine Macedonia]], [[Epirus]] and other regions (including women, sometimes even monks), not only aristocrats. The South Slavs, however, maintained the tradition of only giving a personal name, sometimes with a [[Patronymic]]. There are only 2 cases of family names used by South Slavs during this time; Bogdanopoulos and Serbopoulos, both Serbian names with the Greek suffix -opoulos (όπουλος, originating in [[Peloponnese]] in the 10th century)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.scientificcommons.org/41510473&lt;/ref&gt;

In older naming convention which was common in Serbia up until the mid 19th century a person's name would consist of three distinct parts: the person's given name, the patronymic derived from father's personal name, and the family name, as seen in for example in the name of language reformer Vuk Stefanović Karadžić.

Takurua signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] on an unknown date in 1840, but it was probably in the [[Bay of Islands]]. She was one of a select few of Māori women who signed the treaty.

'''Tom Rodgers''' (born July 28, 1960) is a Washington, DC, activist and advocate for Native Americans and tribal issues. He is an enrolled member of the [[Blackfeet Nation]] in [[Montana]], and is a nationally-recognized commentator on Native American issues, politics, and ethics. In 1994, Rodgers founded Carlyle Consulting, a governmental/media/public relations firm located in Alexandria, Virginia that represents the interests of Native Americans.

Rodgers played an important role in the investigation that led to the conviction of former lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]].&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/77951-man-who-blew-the-whistle-on-abramoff-tells-his-story | title=The man who blew the whistle on Jack Abramoff tells the story of how he did it | date=January 26, 2010 | accessdate=May 27, 2012 | author=Crabtree, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Rodgers has waged a Native American Voting Rights effort to help provide Native Americans on remote, poverty-stricken reservations with equal access to voting. Rodgers has dubbed the effort to suppress the Native American vote "the Jim Crow of the West." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jurist.org/hotline/2016/11/Tom-Rodgers-native-americans.php|title=For Native Americans, Jim Crow is Alive &amp; Well in the West|website=www.jurist.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a lead role in an historic [http://www.jurist.org/hotline/2016/11/Tom-Rodgers-native-americans.php Native American voter registration and turnout effort] in the 2016 elections. The effort drew the support of Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and National Congress of American Indians, prevailing in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Attorney General Eric Holder in June 2014 stated that the Montana native voting rights "conditions are unacceptable and they are outrageous......As a nation, we cannot -- and we will not -- simply stand by as the voices of Native Americans are shut out of the democratic process."

In May 2015, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, a [https://www.justice.gov/tribal/department-justice-proposes-legislation-improve-access-voting-american-indians-and-alaska stalwart proponent of expanding voter access for Native Americans],  transmitted to Vice President Joe Biden and Speaker of the House John Boehner a request in statutory form that the outcome sought in the Wandering Medicine litigation should be enacted into federal law. This was soon followed by introduction of legislation by Senators Jon Tester, Heidi Heitkamp, Tom Udall, and Al Franken. The federal action elevated the significance of the Wandering Medicine litigation in the Native Americans empowerment and enfranchisement movement dating back to the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.[http://www.carlyleconsult.com/] In the spring of 2018, Tester broadened the Native American voter access fight, demanding Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Director Tracy Toulou of the Office of Tribal Justice [https://www.tester.senate.gov/files/Letters/2018-05-16%20AG%20Session%20Director%20Toulou_DOJ%20OTJ_Native%20Voting%20Rights.pdf establish satellite voting locations on tribal lands]. 

Building off the voter project, in the fall of 2016 Rodgers joined a national advocacy effort on behalf of the [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation|Standing Rock Sioux]], working to educate lawmakers and officials in Washington, D.C. and nationwide to the need to protect the water supply for the tribe and all downstream residents in the upper Missouri River region from the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bazfile.blogspot.com/2016/12/standing-rock-protest-panel-at.html|title=The Baz File: Standing Rock Protest Panel at Georgetown Law|last=File|first=The Baz|date=2016-12-02|website=The Baz File|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodgers is currently engaged in an effort to repatriate to his native land the remains and spirit of Jim Thorpe, one of the greatest athletes in history known in his Sac and Fox Nation as Wa-tho-huck (the "light after the lightning”). In what Rodgers describes as a "sacred covenant" with Bill Thorpe, the son of Wa-tho-huck, Rodgers is working to have Wa-tho-huck's remains moved from a tomb in Pennsylvania to Oklahoma, so his spirit can rest in peace in his ancestral home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/17163767/heated-debate-now-lawsuit-burial-ground-jim-thorpe-remains-continues-today|title=The bones of Jim Thorpe do not rest easy|last=Streeter|first=Kurt|date=July 28, 2016|work=|newspaper=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodgers is also leading an ongoing effort to educate people about the impact the opioid crisis has had on Native American tribes and nations. Rodgers is organizing Native Americans as  part of a federal class action lawsuit against opioid manufacturers and distributors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/387028-the-forgotten-people-of-the-opioid-epidemic|title=The 'forgotten people' of the opioid epidemic|last=Evans|first=Garrett|date=2018-05-10|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal action taken by his own Blackfeet Nation was named in July 2018 as one of two Native American bellwether cases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/sites/ohnd/files/770.pdf|title=The Blackfeet Tribe of The Blackfeet Indian  Reservation v.

==Early life and education==
Rodgers was born and raised on the [[Great Plains]] near [[Glasgow, Montana]], considered to be the most isolated community in the U.S. and located in "the middle of nowhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/02/20/using-the-best-data-possible-we-set-out-to-find-the-middle-of-nowhere/|title=Analysis {{!}} Using the best data possible, we set out to find the middle of nowhere|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodgers obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Economics, J.D. and L.L.M in Taxation at the University of Denver. He went on to obtain a Masters in International Public Policy with an emphasis in China Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He also attended the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business Executive MBA program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.carlyleconsult.com/resume.asp | title=RESUME | accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodgers commitment to education includes regularly speaking before high school and college students.

==Advocacy and representation==
From 1990 to 1993, Rodgers served as tax legislative counsel to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus. Before that, he served as tax counsel to United States Tax Court Judge Marvin F. Peterson. Rodgers went on to form [http://www.carlyleconsult.com/ Carlyle Consulting].&lt;ref name=hill/&gt; He has written about persistent poverty and high unemployment in Native American communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spotlightonpoverty.org/ExclusiveCommentary.aspx?id=0fe5c04e-fdbf-4718-980c-0373ba823da7 | title=Native American Poverty | accessdate=May 27, 2012 | author=Rodger, Toms}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rodgers established a scholarship at his alma mater, The [[Sturm College of Law|University of Denver Sturm College of Law]], named the [http://law.du.edu/index.php/financial-aid/tuition-and-financial-aid/du-scholarships/tom-rodgers-ethics-in-government-stipend?

The total scholarship value is around $160,000 over three years.&lt;ref name=indian&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/02/09/abramoff-whistle-blower-tom-rodgers-creates-scholarship-for-native-students-96778 | title=Abramoff Whistle-Blower Tom Rodgers Creates Scholarship for Native Students | date=February 9, 2012 | accessdate=May 27, 2012 | author=Toensing, Gale Courey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rodgers has raised more than $1.2 million in charity for Native American youth, tribal governments, Native American financial literacy programs, and Native American voting rights efforts.

==Jack Abramoff whistleblower==
After years of advocating for "Indian Country", Rodgers was approached in early 2002 by tribal leaders from [https://web.archive.org/web/20050324014815/http://coushattatribela.org/  The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana] and [http://www.sagchip.org/  The Saginaw Chippewa of Michigan] to discuss threats that had been made to them by their lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]]. They expressed concern as to the services they were receiving in exchange for the large amount being charged.&lt;ref name=hill/&gt;
 
Rodgers worked with the tribal members to gather internal invoices and documents, and leak the documents to reporters. They were instrumental in exposing Abramoff's criminal activities, which subsequently led to the arrest of former Rep. [[Bob Ney]] (R-Ohio), helping to force then-Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]] (R-Texas) from office. During this time, Rodgers was represented by whistle-blowers' advocate, Houston attorney [[Philip H. Hilder]]. In the aftermath, Congress passed the most sweeping new ethics rules since Watergate.&lt;ref name=hill/&gt;

Rodgers has continued to track Abramoff to criticize his reform claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://peterbcollins.com/2011/11/07/abramoff-whistleblower-tom-rodgers-slams-60-minutes-and-leslie-stahls-softballs-rinku-sen-reports-that-obamas-ice-rips-families-apart/ | title=Abramoff Whistleblower Tom Rodgers Slams ’60 Minutes’ and Leslie Stahl’s Softballs; Rinku Sen Reports that Obama’s ICE Rips Families Apart | date=November 7, 2011 | accessdate=May 27, 2012 | author=Collins, Peter B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to question the intentions of organizations that have shown support for Abramoff’s recent reform efforts,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/214593-tribes-rip-abramoff-watchdogs | title=Tribes rip Abramoff, ethics watchdogs | date=March 7, 2012 | accessdate=May 27, 2012 | author=Yager, Jordy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the extent to which Abramoff’s influence reached into the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/214299-abramoff-said-his-corrupting-influenence-reached-into-the-media | title=Abramoff says his corrupting influence reached into the media | date=March 5, 2012 | accessdate=May 27, 2012 | author=Yager , Jordy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodgers appeared in the documentary, [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1540814/ ‘’Casino Jack and the United States of Money’’], by [[Alex Gibney]] about the career and corruption scandal surrounding Jack Abramoff. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gibney|first=Alex|title=Casino Jack and the United States of Money|date=2010-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1540814/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|accessdate=2016-06-21}} &lt;/ref&gt;  He received an ethics award from the University of Denver for his role in bringing to light Abramoff’s criminal actions.&lt;ref name="indian" /&gt;

Rodgers has been interviewed on the Abramoff case, as well as on Native American rights, for media outlets, including ''The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, USA Today, The Hill, The Huffington Post,'' BBC, ''The Nation,'' CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, ''The Atlantic, Roll Call, Financial Times, Bloomberg News, Talking Points Memo, Washingtonian, Indian Country Today,'' Democracy NOW, and the National Press Club newsmakers series.

'''William Bradley''' (10 February 1787 – 30 May 1820), known more commonly as '''Giant Bradley''' or '''the Yorkshire Giant''', is the tallest recorded British man that ever lived, measuring {{convert|7|ft|9|in|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://notmuchfits.co.uk/height-list/|publisher=NotMuchFits.co.uk|title=Stand Up Tall and Be Proud|date=23 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121043800/http://notmuchfits.co.uk/height-list/|archivedate=21 November 2008|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley was {{convert|5|mm|in|1|order=flip}} taller than [[Bao Xishun]], who was recognised as world's tallest living man by [[Guinness World Records]] between 2005 and 2007.

==Biography==
Born in [[Market Weighton]] within the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], William was the fourth son in a family of thirteen and weighed 14&amp;nbsp;[[pounds (mass)|pounds]] (6.35&amp;nbsp;kg) at birth.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=402631&amp;in_page_id=1770|work=Daily Mail |location=UK|title=In depth: the story of the Yorkshire Giant|date=28 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929161045/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=402631&amp;in_page_id=1770|archivedate=29 September 2007|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, a master tailor measured {{convert|5|ft|9|in|m|2|abbr=on}}, while his siblings and mother Anne were of average size, although one sister who died in an accident at age 16 was tall.&lt;ref name="Giant"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://inviewonline.co.uk/issues/05%20west%20june%2006.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=The West In View|title=This Giant remains among friends|date=23 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929195837/http://inviewonline.co.uk/issues/05%20west%20june%2006.pdf|archivedate=29 September 2007|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was said to have been teased at school because of his height, though many students were scared of him.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt; Teachers at the school were said to have punished misbehaving students by getting Bradley to lift them onto high cross beams, until the teacher decided to have them taken down again.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt; After leaving school he worked on a farm near the town of [[Pocklington]], earning less than 10 shillings (50[[pence|p]]) a week.&lt;ref name="Giant"/&gt;

===The Yorkshire Giant===
Bradley travelled with a group of showmen under the alias of the '''Yorkshire Giant'''; at the time, the [[freak show]]s were popular and would draw large crowds. As the tallest British man, Bradley was a prized asset in the business joining the huge Yorkshire Pig which was bred in [[Sancton]] two miles from Market Weighton.&lt;ref name="Giant"/&gt;

After touring many fairs up and down the country, including the [[Hull Fair]], he parted from his minder by 1815 to manage himself. He would charge a shilling for each person to visit him in a room which he hired in various towns.&lt;ref name="Giant"/&gt; He was even presented before [[King George III]] at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] who gave him a large golden watch on a chain, which he wore for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giant"/&gt;

Bradley died aged 33 in his hometown of Market Weighton, where he was buried inside the church because of fears of graverobbing.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt; His house still stands on Market Hill. The [[A1079 road]] which passes Market Weighton is named Giant Bradley Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giant Bradley Way|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/60153/notices/1597409/all=York|date=24 May 2012|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Giant Community Day==
An annual festival is organised in memory of William Bradley in his home town of [[Market Weighton]]. The event has been held annually in May since 1996 and is attended by hundreds of people in the town. It is a family-oriented event with games, amusement rides, stalls and other attractions, including the famous "Weighton Lash". [[Christopher Greener]] who was the tallest living European for a period of time has taken part in the celebrations in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bridlingtonfreepress.co.uk/news/the-yorkshire-giant-1-1723547|title=The Yorkshire Giant|date=27 May 2008|work=Bridlington Free Press|accessdate=6 June 2018|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir William Henry Perkin''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (12 March 1838 – 14 July 1907)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|35477|Perkin, Sir William Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[chemist]] and entrepreneur best known for his serendipitous discovery of the first synthetic [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[dye]], [[mauveine]], made from [[aniline]]. Though he failed in trying to [[Chemical synthesis|synthesise]] [[quinine]] for the treatment of [[malaria]], he became successful in the field of [[dye]]s after his first discovery at the age of 18.&lt;ref name=“CNN”&gt;{{cite news|title=The color purple: How an accidental discovery changed fashion forever|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/perkin-mauve-purple/index.html|agency=CNN|date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkin set up a factory to produce the dye industrially. Lee Blaszczyk, professor of business history at the University of Leeds, states, "By laying the foundation for the [[Synthetic organic chemistry|synthetic organic chemical]]s industry, Perkin helped to revolutionize the world of fashion."&lt;ref name=“CNN”/&gt;

== Early years ==
William Perkin was born in  [[East End of London]],&lt;ref&gt;At 3 King David Lane, off [[Cable Street]], [[Shadwell]]: Baptisms Solemnised in the Parish of Saint Paul, Shadwell, County of Middlesex, in the Year 1838, page 181.&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest of the seven children of George Perkin, a successful carpenter. His mother, Sarah, was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent and moved to East London as a child.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;UXL Encyclopedia of World Biography (2003). Accessed 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptized in the Anglican parish church of [[St. Paul's Church, Shadwell|St Paul's, Shadwell]], which had been connected to such luminaries as [[James Cook]], [[Jane Randolph Jefferson]] (mother of [[Thomas Jefferson]]) and [[John Wesley]].

At the age of 14, Perkin attended the [[City of London School]], where he was taught by Thomas Hall, who fostered his scientific talent and encouraged him to pursue a career in chemistry.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com" /&gt;

== Accidental discovery of mauveine ==
In 1853, at the age of 15, Perkin entered the [[Royal College of Chemistry]] in London (now part of [[Imperial College London]]), where he began his studies under [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]].&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 173"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Perkin, Sir William Henry |volume=21 |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, [[chemistry]] was still primitive: although the major [[Chemical element|elements]] had been discovered and techniques to analyze the proportions of the elements in many [[Chemical compound|compounds]] were in place, it was still a difficult proposition to determine the arrangement of the elements in compounds. Hofmann had published a hypothesis on how it might be possible to [[Quinine total synthesis|synthesise quinine]], an expensive natural substance much in demand for the treatment of [[malaria]].&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; Having become one of Hofmann's assistants, Perkin embarked on a series of experiments to try to achieve this end.

During [[Easter]] vacation in 1856, Perkin performed some further experiments in the crude laboratory in his apartment on the top floor of his home in [[Cable Street]] in east London. It was here that he made his great accidental discovery: that [[aniline]] could be partly [[Chemical transformation|transformed]] into a crude mixture which, when [[Extraction (chemistry)|extracted]] with [[alcohol]], produced a substance with an intense [[purple]] colour.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 173"/&gt; Perkin, who had an interest in painting and photography, immediately became enthusiastic about this result and carried out further trials with his friend [[Arthur Herbert Church|Arthur Church]] and his brother Thomas. Since these experiments were not part of the work on quinine which had been assigned to Perkin, the trio carried them out in a hut in Perkin's garden to keep them secret from Hofmann.

They satisfied themselves that they might be able to scale up production of the purple substance and [[Commercialization|commercialise]] it as a [[dye]], which they called [[mauveine]]. Their initial experiments indicated that it dyed [[silk]] in a way which was [[Colour fastness|stable]] when washed or exposed to light. They sent some samples to a dye works in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland, and received a very promising reply from the general manager of the company, [[Robert Pullar]]. Perkin filed for a [[patent]] in August 1856, when he was still only 18.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 173"/&gt;

[[File:Charles Rees (in mauveine-dyed bowtie).jpg|thumb|Professor [[Charles Rees]] wearing a bow tie dyed with an original sample of [[mauveine]] while holding a [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] journal named after Perkin]]
At the time, all dyes used for colouring cloth were natural substances, many of which were expensive and labour-intensive to extract—and many lacked stability, or fastness. The colour purple, which had been a mark of aristocracy and prestige since ancient times, was especially expensive and difficult to produce, as the dye used, known as [[Tyrian purple]], was made from the glandular [[mucus]] of certain [[Mollusca|molluscs]]. Its extraction was variable and complicated, and so Perkin and his brother realised that they had discovered a possible substitute whose production could be commercially successful.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;

Perkin could not have chosen a better time or place for his discovery: England was the cradle of the [[Industrial Revolution]], largely driven by advances in the production of textiles; the science of chemistry had advanced to the point where it could have a major impact on industrial processes; and [[coal tar]], the major source of his raw material, was an abundant by-product of the process for making [[coal gas]] and [[Coke (fuel)|coke]].&lt;ref name="chemistry.msu.edu"&gt;Michigan State University, Department of Chemistry website.{{cite web|url=http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-19|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030202902/http://www.chemistry.msu.edu/Portraits/PortraitsHH_Detail.asp?HH_LName=Perkin|archivedate=30 October 2007|df=dmy-all}} Accessed 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having invented the dye, Perkin was still faced with the problems of raising the [[Capital investment|capital]] for producing it, manufacturing it cheaply, adapting it for use in dyeing [[cotton]], gaining acceptance for it among commercial dyers, and creating public demand for it. He was active in all of these areas: he persuaded his father to put up the capital, and his brothers to partner with him to build a factory; he invented a [[mordant]] for cotton; he gave technical advice to the dyeing industry; and he publicised his invention of the dye. 

Public demand was increased when a similar colour was adopted by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in Britain and by [[Empress Eugénie]], wife of Napoleon III, in France, and  when the [[crinoline]] or hooped-skirt, whose manufacture used a large quantity of cloth, became fashionable. Everything fell into place: with hard work and lucky timing, Perkin became rich.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; After the discovery of mauveine, many new [[aniline dye]]s appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe.

=== In popular culture ===
*This discovery was the subject of a question on the 2012 season of the [[BBC]] quiz show [[Eggheads (TV series)|''Eggheads'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eggheads – series 13|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n3mxk|agency=BBC Two|date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years ==
[[File:WilliamPerkinBluePlaque.png|thumb|Blue plaque in [[Cable Street]]  ]]
William Perkin continued active research in [[organic chemistry]] for the rest of his life: he discovered and marketed other [[synthetic dyes]], including ''Britannia Violet'' and ''Perkin's Green''; he discovered ways to make [[coumarin]], one of the first synthetic raw materials of [[perfume]], and [[cinnamic acid]]. (The reaction used to make the last became known as the [[Perkin reaction]].)&lt;ref name="chemistry.msu.edu"/&gt; Local lore has it that the colour of the nearby [[Grand Union Canal]] changed from week to week depending on the activity at Perkin's [[Greenford]] dyeworks. 

In 1869, Perkin found a method for the commercial production from [[anthracene]] of the brilliant red dye [[alizarin]], which had been isolated and identified from [[Rubia|madder]] root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist [[Pierre Robiquet]], simultaneously with [[Purpurin (dye)|purpurin]], another red dye of lesser industrial interest, but the German chemical company [[BASF]] patented the same process one day before he did.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 173"/&gt; 

During the next decade, the new German Empire was rapidly eclipsing Britain as the centre of Europe's chemical industry. By the 1890s, Germany had a near-[[monopoly]] on the business and Perkin was compelled to sell off his holdings and retire.

== Death ==
[[File:William Perkin's Grave, Christchurch, Harrow.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Perkin's gravestone]]
Perkin died in 1907 of [[pneumonia]] and other complications resulting from a burst [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]]. He is buried in the grounds of Christchurch, [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], [[Middlesex]].&lt;ref name=Leather&gt;''The Leathersellers' Review 2005–06'', pp 12–14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Perkin married Jemima Harriet, the daughter of John Lissett, in 1859, which resulted in two sons, ([[William Henry Perkin Jr.]] and [[Arthur George Perkin]]). Perkin's second marriage was in 1866, to Alexandrine Caroline, daughter of Helman Mollwo.  They had one son (Frederick Mollwo Perkin) and four daughters. All three sons became chemists.&lt;ref name=Leather /&gt;

== Honours, awards and commemorations ==
[[File:Perkin factory.jpg|thumb|left|Blue plaque in [[Greenford]], [[England]], near the [[Grand Union Canal]]]]
Perkin received many honours in his lifetime. In June 1866, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]. In 1879, received their [[Royal Medal]] and, in 1889, their [[Davy Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27perkin%27%29|title= Library and Archive catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 8 November 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107053225/http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27perkin%27%29|archivedate= 7 November 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[knight]]ed in 1906, and in the same year was awarded the first [[Perkin Medal]], established to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of his discovery of [[mauveine]].&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 173" /&gt; Today, the Perkin Medal is widely acknowledged as the highest honour in the U.S. industrial chemistry and has been awarded annually by the American section of the [[Society of Chemical Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Perkin Medal History|url=http://sci-america.org/site/?page_id=68|agency=SCI America|date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI Perkin Medal"&gt;{{cite web|title=SCI Perkin Medal|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/sci-perkin-medal|website=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkin was a [[Liveryman]] of the [[Leathersellers' Company]] for 46 years and was elected Master of the Company for the year 1896–97.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Chemical Society, Part 4. p. 1741. The Society. 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

Today [[blue plaque]]s mark the sites of Perkin's home in [[Cable Street]], by the junction with King David Lane, and the Perkin factory in [[Greenford]], [[Middlesex]].

On 12 March 2018, search engine [[Google]] showed a [[Google Doodle]] to mark Perkin’s 180th Birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/doodles/sir-william-henry-perkins-180th-birthday “Sir William Henry Perkin’s 180th Birthday”]. Google.com. Retrieved 12 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== William Perkin High School ===
In 2013, the William Perkin Church of England High School opened in [[Greenford]], [[Middlesex]]. The school is operated by the [[Twyford Church of England Academies Trust]] (which also operates [[Twyford Church of England High School]]). The school is named after William Perkin, and has adopted a [[mauve]] uniform and colour scheme, in tribute to his discovery of mauveine.&lt;ref&gt;The history of Perkin and Mauveine is oulined on the school's [http://www.williamperkin.org.uk/welcome/ website here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220659/http://www.williamperkin.org.uk/welcome/ |date=4 October 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperial College London===
Since 2007, when [[Imperial College London]] gained its own Royal Charter, the [[Academic dress of Imperial College London]] features purple across the range of garments to celebrate the work of Perkin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burgon.org.uk/practice/regs/uk/Imperial.pdf “Imperial College London Academic dress”]. Burgon.co.uk. Retrieved 12 March 018&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, President of the College, Professor Alice Gast, stated that: "The colour purple symbolises the spirit of endeavour and discovery, and the risk-taking nature that characterises those with an Imperial education and training."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/165452/imperial-students-celebrate-largest-ever-postgraduate/ “Imperial students celebrate in largest ever Postgraduate Graduation Ceremonies”].
