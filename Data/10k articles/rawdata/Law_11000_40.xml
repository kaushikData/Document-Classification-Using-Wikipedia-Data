      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">In the [[United Kingdom]], the '''advance corporation tax''' (ACT) was part of a partial [[dividend imputation]] system introduced in 1973 under which companies were required to [[withholding tax|withhold tax]] on [[dividend]]s before they were distributed to shareholders. The scheme was similar to the way banks were required to withhold an amount at a set rate on interest earned on bank deposits before it is paid to the account holder.

In general, this payment meant that the recipients of the dividend were considered to have already paid basic rate tax on the dividend income. Non-taxpayers, such as pension funds, who would not otherwise have paid income tax on the dividend income, became entitled to claim a refund of the ACT amount, or after 1993 a lesser amount. The refund of ACT for non-taxpayers was scrapped in 1997, but in 1999 ACT was itself scrapped, effectively making dividend income of non-taxpayers tax-free again.

The amount of ACT paid by a company could also be offset against the company's profits reducing its final [[United Kingdom corporation tax|corporation tax]] bill. ACT was scrapped in 1999.

== History ==
Until 1973, company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income. In 1973, a partial imputation system was introduced for dividend payments, under which companies were required to withhold tax on dividends, called an advance corporation tax, before they were distributed to shareholders. UK companies could set off the ACT amount withheld against the overall company tax liability, subject to certain limits.&lt;ref name="CTM20105"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm20105.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM20105 — ACT: set-off against CT on profits: introduction], HMRC. Retrieved 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (The full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed.) Shareholders of a UK company who received a dividend received a [[tax credit]] representing the ACT paid,&lt;ref name="CTM16120"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm16120.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM16120 — Distributions: impact on CT: franked investment income: general], HMRC. Retrieved 12 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which could be set off against their overall income tax liability.&lt;ref name="CTM15150"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM15150.htm Company Taxation Manual CTM15150 — Distributions: general: tax consequences], HMRC. Retrieved 12 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Non-taxable shareholders, such as pension funds, were entitled to a refund of the ACT amount.

When introduced in 1973, the ACT rate on the gross dividend (the amount distributed plus the ACT withheld) was 30%, the basic rate of income tax at the time. Until 1993 the income tax rate payable on dividends was the same as all other income, and the ACT rate was adjusted to align it to changes in the basic rate of income tax. From April 1993, the ACT rate was cut to 22.5% while the tax rate on dividend income was set at 20%, the first time it was set at a different rate to that payable on other income (25%). The tax credit was tied to the 20% rate rather than the ACT rate of 22.5%, meaning that non-taxpayers could no longer claim a refund for the full amount that had previously been paid as ACT. The ACT rate was cut to 20% from April 1994.

In 1997, the tax credit was scrapped for non-taxpayers (except charities and [[Personal Equity Plan|PEPs]]), which had a particular impact on pension funds, which could no longer claim a refund for any amount that had previously been paid as ACT. The effect of the change was that pension funds became effectively taxed on dividend income by way of the now non-refundable ACT, thus lowering pension returns and allegedly resulting in the winding up of some pension funds. Treasury argued that the change was crucial to long-term economic growth: the existing corporation tax system created biased incentives for corporations to pay out profits as dividends to shareholders (including pension funds, who could then reclaim the tax paid) rather than to reinvest them into company growth (which would result in corporation tax being paid). The old system of corporation tax was widely viewed by economists as a constraint on British economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/evandavis/2007/04/that_pensions_raid.html That pensions raid], [[Evan Davis (journalist)|Evan Davis]] 2 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' obtained documents under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] in April 2007 that showed the chancellor [[Gordon Brown]] had been advised that pension funds would suffer a £67 billion loss of the actuarial value of their assets as a net result of a combination of policies including the ACT change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1599843.ece Gloomy predictions that the Chancellor chose to ignore - Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 6 April 2016, the tax credit was itself abolished and replaced with a tax-free dividend allowance of £5,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dividend-allowance-factsheet/dividend-allowance-factsheet HM Revenue &amp; Customs Policy paper: Dividend Allowance factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alakram Gummatov.jpg|thumb|Alikram Hummatov in 2009]]
'''Alikram Hummatov''' or '''Ali Akram Hemmatzadeh''' (also spelled as '''Alikram Gummatov''', born 1948) is a [[Talysh people|Talysh]] military and political activist of [[Azerbaijan]], the president of self-proclaimed [[Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic]] in 1993, formerly prisoned in [[Azerbaijan]]. He was considered as a [[political prisoner]] by international organizations including [[Amnesty International]] and [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name="amnesty.org.ru"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org.ru/library/Index/ENGEUR010072002?open&amp;of=ENG-380 Amnesty International, Concerns in Europe, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2003/06/mil-030627-rfel-144959.htm Azerbaijan: Council Of Europe Gives Baku Another Two Months On Issue Of Political Prisoners, By Jean-Christophe Peuch, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,HRW,,AZE,3e28183d0,0.html World Report 2003 - Azerbaijan]. Human Rights Watch&lt;/ref&gt; After demands from the [[Council of Europe]], Hummatov was granted retrials, yet according to [[Human Rights Watch]] report, the authorities conducted him inside prisons, and with procedural violations.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org" /&gt;

==Biography==
Hummatov finished Polytechnic Institute of [[Baku]]. He participated in different parties, including [[Popular Front of Azerbaijan]]. Hummatov, who was "seen by many Azeris as a dangerous separatist",&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2733283.stm Azerbaijan in a stir over political prisoner], BBC, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; was the leader of the self-declared [[Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic]] which existed briefly in the south of Azerbaijan at a time of political instability in 1993.

==Imprisonment==
In 1995 Hummatov was sentenced to death by the Azerbaijani court, later commuted to life imprisonment, on a range of charges including [[treason]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt; In an open letter to the president [[Ilham Aliyev]], Sidiki Kaba, the president of the [[International Federation of Human Rights]], wrote, that Hummatov and Qaziyez "are being held in Qobustan prison. Their prison system is very strict and sentences them to isolation. In fact, under the pretext of protecting their physical integrity, these two prisoners have been locked up alone, in closed cells at night, which prevents them from receiving medical assistance throughout the night in the case a problem should arise."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fidh.org/Open-letter-to-Mr-H-E-Heydar-Aliev "Open letter to Mr. H.E Heydar Aliev, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan"]. Sidiki Kaba, FIDH, April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In prison Hummatov fell ill with [[tuberculosis]] and lost almost all of his teeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/newstext/news/id/647272.html Резко ухудшилось здоровье азербайджанского политического заключенного Алиакрама Гумматова]&lt;/ref&gt; He was among those identified in 2001 by the [[Council of Europe]], as political prisoners who should either be released or retried.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org.ru" /&gt; In 2004 Hummatov has been pardoned by president Aliev, was deprived by the Azerbaijani citizenship and sent to the [[Netherlands]] where his family lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/caucas1/msg/2004/09/m32302.htm Аликрама Гумматова заставили отказаться от гражданства Азербайджана]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Hummatov vs. Azerbaijan'' case at the European Court==
After emigrating to the [[Netherlands]], Hummatov made two applications against the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] to the [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court]] under Article 34 of the [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]]. On 29 November 2007 the court has sentenced the state of Azerbaijan to pay the applicant 12,000 [[Euro]]s in respect of non-pecuniary damage and 2,090 [[euros]] in respect of costs and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,ECHR,,AZE,4562d8cf2,474fcc072,0.html ''Hummatov v. Azerbaijan'' Judgement], UNHCR, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activities==
Hummatov continues to campaign in exile for the rights of the Talysh people. In September 2013, he visited the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Artsakh]], two decades after confronting Karabakh and Armenian forces on the battlefield. He met with university students in [[Stepanakert]], where he criticized the current Azerbaijani government and called for a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, stating "I believe that we must do everything to establish peace in the region so that our beloved children live, create and study in peaceful conditions." Hummatov referred to the region as Artsakh, the ancient Armenian name, and also met with the Parliament Speaker of Nagorno-Karabakh, [[Ashot Ghulian]]. He traveled to Karabakh from Armenia, where he inaugurated a graduate program of Talysh studies at the [[Yerevan State University]] on 24 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Azeri Commander Visits Artsakh|url=http://asbarez.com/114375/former-azeri-commander-visits-artsakh/|date=26 September 2013|publisher=[[Asbarez]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Hummatov is married to Sudaba Rasulova. They have 2 sons. According to Rasulova, neither she, nor her children know Talysh language, and the only language of communication in their family is [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]].&lt;ref name=musavat&gt;{{az icon}} {{cite news|last=Həsənli|first=Elbəyi|title=Ələkrəm Hümmətovun həyat yoldaşından sensasion müsahibə|url=http://musavat.com/news/g%C3%BCnd%C9%99m/%C6%8Fl%C9%99kr%C9%99m-H%C3%BCmm%C9%99tovun-h%C9%99yat-yolda%C5%9F%C4%B1ndan-sensasion-m%C3%BCsahib%C9%99_166411.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=Yeni Müsavat|date=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rasulova stated that she was unaware of Hummatov's plans to visit Armenia, and she does not understand why her husband traveled there.&lt;ref name=musavat/&gt;

'''Bank regulation in the United States''' is highly fragmented compared with other [[Group of Ten (economic)|G10]] countries, where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level.  Depending on the type of charter a banking organization has and on its organizational structure, it may be subject to numerous federal and state banking regulations. Apart from the bank regulatory agencies the U.S. maintains separate securities, commodities, and insurance regulatory agencies at the federal and state level, unlike Japan and the United Kingdom (where regulatory authority over the banking, securities and insurance industries is combined into one single financial-service agency).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsa.go.jp/en/index.html |title=Financial Services Agency |publisher=The Japanese Government |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bank examiner]]s are generally employed to supervise banks and to ensure compliance with regulations.

U.S. banking regulation addresses privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-[[usury]] lending, and the promotion of lending to lower-income populations. Some individual cities also enact their own [[financial regulation]] laws (for example, defining what constitutes usurious lending).

==Regulatory authority==
A bank's primary federal regulator could be the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], the [[Federal Reserve Board]], or the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]].  Within the [[Federal Reserve System]] are 12 districts centered around 12 regional [[Federal Reserve Banks]], each of which carries out the Federal Reserve Board's regulatory responsibilities in its respective district. [[Credit unions in the United States|Credit unions]] are subject to most bank regulations and are supervised by the [[National Credit Union Administration]]. The [[Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council]] (FFIEC) establishes uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the other agencies.

State regulation of state-chartered banks and certain non-bank affiliates of federally chartered banks applies in addition to federal regulation. State-chartered banks are subject to the regulation of the state regulatory agency of the state in which they were chartered. For example, a California state bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System would be regulated by both the California Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. Likewise, a Nevada state bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System would be jointly regulated by the Nevada Division of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve.

By statute, and in accordance with judicial interpretation of statutes and the [[United States Constitution]], federal banking statutes (and the regulations and other guidance issued by federal banking regulatory agencies) often preempt state laws regulating certain activities of nationally chartered banking institutions and their subsidiaries. Specific exceptions to the general rule of federal preemption exist such as some [[contract law]], [[escheat]] law, and [[insurance law]].

One example is the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] preempting federal savings associations from certain state laws.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, Section 550.136(a) "...OTS occupies the field of the regulation of the fiduciary activities of Federal savings associations...Accordingly, Federal savings associations may exercise fiduciary powers as authorized under Federal law, including this part, without regard to State laws that purport to regulate or otherwise affect their fiduciary activities, except to the extent provided in 12 U.S.C. § 1464(n)...or in paragraph (c) of this section."&lt;/ref&gt; 12 U.S.C. § 1464(n) authorizes fiduciary activities for federal savings associations, and specifies certain state law requirements that are applicable to federal savings associations.  12 C.F.R. §550.136(c) lists six types of state laws that, in certain specified circumstances, are not preempted with respect to federal savings associations.{{technical statement|date=October 2015}}

==Privacy==
{{Further|Right to Financial Privacy Act}}
''Regulation P'' governs the use of a customer's private data. Banks and other financial institutions must inform a consumer of their policy regarding personal information, and must provide an "opt-out" before disclosing data to a non-affiliated third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/regpcg.htm|title=Federal Reserve Bank: Regulation P compliance guide|publisher=Federalreserve.gov|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation was enacted in 1999.

Concerning [[know your customer]] rules and [[Bank Secrecy Act]] regulations, financial institutions are encouraged to keep track of customers employment status and other business dealings, including whether or not the financial activity of customers are consistent with their business activities, and report on customers' suspect activities to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bank Secrecy Act Examination Manual|pages=190–193|publisher=[[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]]|date=September 1999|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/SupManual/bsa/7-00bsaman.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Porn, Pot and Payday Lenders Unwelcome in Banks|first=Rob|last=Garver|date=May 19, 2014|work=[[The Fiscal Times]]|url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/19/Porn-Pot-and-Payday-Lenders-Unwelcome-Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism==
{{Further|Bank Secrecy Act|USA PATRIOT Act|Office of Foreign Assets Control}}

At its core, financial transparency requires financial institutions to implement certain basic controls:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks From Under Secretary of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen on 'Addressing the Illicit Finance Risks of Virtual Currency'|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|date=March 18, 2014|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl236.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* they must know who their customers are (so-called [[know your customer]] rules);
* they must understand their customers' normal and expected transactions;
* and they must keep the necessary records and make the necessary reports on their customers.

The ''Bank Secrecy Act'' (BSA) requires financial institutions to assist [[government agency|government agencies]] to detect and prevent [[money laundering]].  Specifically, the act requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of [[negotiable instruments]], file reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, [[tax evasion]] or other criminal activities.

Section 326 of the ''USA PATRIOT Act'' allows financial institutions to place limits on new accounts until the account holder's identity has been verified.

''Office of Foreign Assets Control'' (OFAC) ''sanctions'' apply to all U.S. entities including banks. The FFIEC provides guidelines to financial regulators for verifying compliance with the sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/documents/1-IntroductionCoreOverviewsProcedures.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527160639/http://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/documents/1-IntroductionCoreOverviewsProcedures.pdf |date=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community reinvestment==
{{Further|Community Reinvestment Act}}
The ''Community Reinvestment Act'' of 1977 requires insured depository institutions to reinvest in the communities they serve. There should be an emphasis on low-income and moderate-income (LMI) census tracts and individuals. Insured depository institutions must display a CRA notice, and each branch must have a current CRA public file or access to it via the company's intranet, and must provide the information in person or by mail.

==Deposit account regulation==

===Deposit insurance===
{{Further2|[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]]|[[National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund|NCUSIF]]|[[Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation|FSLIC]]}}
The United States was the second country (after [[Czechoslovakia]])&lt;ref&gt;Padoan, Brenton, Boyd: [https://books.google.com/books?id=7hmPgjHkV_UC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=cs&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Structural Foundations of International Finance: Problems of Growth and Stability"], Edward Elgar Publishing, 2003, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; to officially enact [[deposit insurance]] to protect depositors from losses by insolvent banks. In 1933 the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits at commercial banks.

In 1970 Congress established a separate fund for [[Credit unions in the United States|credit unions]], the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. The NCUSIF insures all federally chartered credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions (98% as of 2009).&lt;ref name="nascus"&gt;[http://www.nascus.org/state-cu-facts.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323194132/http://www.nascus.org/state-cu-facts.htm |date=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some others are insured by the private guaranty corporation [[American Share Insurance]] (156 as of 2009).&lt;ref name="nascus" /&gt; In 1978 foreign banks operating in the United States were required to hold the same level of reserves under the specifications of the [[International Banking Act of 1978|International Banking Act]].&lt;ref name=effects&gt;{{cite journal

In 1934, Congress created the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to insure [[Savings and loan association|savings and loan]] deposits. In the 1980s, during the [[savings and loan crisis]], the FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished; its responsibility was transferred to the FDIC.

Some financial institutions offer insurance in excess of FDIC or NCUA limits. For example, the [[Depositors Insurance Fund]] insures excess deposits at Massachusetts-chartered savings banks. [[American Share Insurance]] provides excess share insurance at participating credit unions.

===Consumer protection===
{{Further|Truth in Savings Act|Electronic Fund Transfer Act|Expedited Funds Availability Act}}

The ''Truth in Savings Act'' (TISA), implemented by ''Regulation DD'', established uniformity in disclosing terms and conditions regarding interest and fees when giving out information and when opening a new savings account. On passing the law in 1991, Congress noted it would help promote economic stability, competition between depository institutions, and allow the consumer to make informed decisions.

The ''Expedited Funds Availability Act'' (EFAA) of 1987, implemented by ''Regulation CC'', defines when standard holds and exception holds can be placed on checks deposited to [[transaction account|checking account]]s, and the maximum length of time the money can be held. A bank's hold policy can be less stringent than the guidelines provided, but it cannot exceed the guidelines.

The ''Electronic Fund Transfer Act'' of 1978, implemented by ''Regulation E'', established the rights and liabilities of consumers as well as the responsibilities of all participants in [[electronic funds transfer]] activities.

===Withdrawal limits and reserve requirements===
{{Further|Regulation D (FRB)}}
*Establishes reserve requirement guidelines
*Regulates certain early withdrawals from [[certificate of deposit]] accounts
*Defines what qualifies as DDA/NOW accounts.  See [[Regulation Q]] for eligibility rules for interest-bearing checking accounts
*Defines limitations on certain withdrawals on savings and money market accounts
**Unlimited transfers or withdrawals if made in person, by ATM, by mail, or by messenger
**In all other instances, there is a limit of six transfers or withdrawals.  No more than three of these transactions may be made payable to a third party (by check, draft, point-of-sale, etc.)
**Some banks will charge a fee with each excess transaction
**Bank must close accounts where this transaction limit is constantly exceeded

===Interest on demand deposits===
{{Further|Regulation Q}}
Until 2011, ''Regulation Q'' prohibited banks from paying interest on demand deposit accounts. A "demand deposit" account includes many, but not all checking accounts, and does not include [[Negotiable Order of Withdrawal account]]s (NOW accounts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=635f26c4af3e2fe4327fd25ef4cb5638&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr217_main_02.tpl |title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations |publisher=Ecfr.gpoaccess.gov |date=October 9, 2012 |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lending regulation==

===Consumer protection===
{{Further|Home Mortgage Disclosure Act|Equal Credit Opportunity Act|Truth in Lending Act}}
The ''Home Mortgage Disclosure Act'' (HMDA) of 1975, implemented by ''Regulation C'', requires financial institutions to maintain and annually disclose data about home purchases, home purchase pre-approvals, home improvement, and refinance applications involving one- to four-unit and multifamily dwellings. It also requires branches and loan centers to display a HMDA poster.

The ''Equal Credit Opportunity Act'' (ECOA) of 1974, implemented by ''Regulation B'', requires creditors which regularly extend credit to customers—including banks, retailers, finance companies, and bank-card companies—to evaluate candidates on [[creditworthiness]] alone, rather than other factors such as race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. Discrimination based on marital status, receipt of public assistance, and age is generally prohibited (with exceptions), as is discrimination based on a consumer's good-faith exercise of his or her credit-protection rights.

The ''Truth in Lending Act'' (TILA) of 1968, implemented by ''Regulation Z'', promotes the informed use of consumer credit by standardizing the disclosure of interest rates and other costs associated with borrowing. TILA also gives consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions involving a lien on the consumer's principal dwelling, regulates certain credit-card practices, and provides a means of resolving credit-billing disputes.

====Debt collection====
{{Main|Fair debt collection|Fair Debt Collection Practices Act|Fair Credit Reporting Act}}
The ''Fair Credit Reporting Act'' (FCRA) of 1970 regulates the collection, sharing, and use of customer-credit information. The act allows consumers to obtain a copy of their credit report from [[credit bureau]]s that hold information on them, provides for consumers to dispute negative information held and sets time limits, after which negative information is suppressed. It requires that consumers be informed when negative information is added to their credit records, and when adverse action is taken based on a credit report.

====Credit cards====
{{Main|Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices}}
Provisions addressing credit-card practices aim to enhance protections for consumers who use credit cards and improve credit-card disclosure under the [[Truth in Lending Act]]:
* Banks would be prohibited from increasing the rate on a pre-existing credit card balance (except under limited circumstances) and must allow the consumer to pay off that balance over a reasonable period of time
* Banks would be prohibited from applying payments in excess of the minimum in a manner that maximizes interest charges
* Banks would be required to give consumers the full benefit of discounted promotional rates on credit cards by applying payments in excess of the minimum to any higher-rate balances first, and by providing a grace period for purchases where the consumer is otherwise eligible
* Banks would be prohibited from imposing interest charges using the "two-cycle" method, which computes interest on balances on days in billing cycles preceding the most recent billing cycle
* Banks would be required to provide consumers a reasonable amount of time to make payments&lt;ref name="FRB_Press_Release_2008-05-02"&gt;Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System: "Press Release--Federal Reserve proposes rules to prohibit unfair practices regarding credit cards and overdraft services--May 2, 2008"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lending limits===
Lending-limit regulations restrict the total amount of loans and credits that a bank may extend to a single borrower.  This restriction is usually stated as a percentage of the bank's capital or assets.  For example, a national bank generally must limit its total outstanding loans and credits to any single borrower to no more than 15% of the bank's total capital and surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr32_main_02.tpl |title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations |publisher=Ecfr.gpoaccess.gov |date=October 9, 2012 |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Some state banking regulations also contain similar lending limits applicable to state-chartered banks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fin&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1220-1238]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both federal and state laws generally allow for a higher lending limit (up to 25% of capital and surplus for national banks) when the portion of the credit that exceeds the initial lending limit is fully secured.

''Loans to Insiders (Regulation O)'' establishes various quantitative and qualitative limits and reporting requirements on extensions of credit made by a bank to its "insiders" or the insiders of the bank's affiliates. The term "insiders" includes executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and the related interests of such parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=635f26c4af3e2fe4327fd25ef4cb5638&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr215_main_02.tpl |title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations |publisher=Ecfr.gpoaccess.gov |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/regulations/cg/regocg.htm |title=Federal Reserve Board: Regulations |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central banking regulation==
{{See also|History of central banking in the United States}}
''Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks'' (Regulation A) establishes rules regarding [[discount window]] lending, the extension of credit by the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] to banks and other institutions. The Federal Reserve Board made significant amendments to Regulation A in 2003, including amendments to price certain discount-window lending at above-market rates and to restrict borrowing to banks in generally sound condition. In amending the regulation, the Federal Reserve Board noted that many banks had expressed their unwillingness to use discount-window borrowing because their use of such a funding source was interpreted as sign of the bank's financial weakness or distress. The Federal Reserve Board indicated its hope that the 2003 amendments would make discount window lending a more attractive funding option to banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=635f26c4af3e2fe4327fd25ef4cb5638&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr201_main_02.tpl |title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations |publisher=Ecfr.gpoaccess.gov |date=October 9, 2012 |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2002/200210312/default.htm |title=FRB: Press Release - Final amendments to Regulation A (Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks) - October 31, 2002 |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date= |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2002/20020517/attachment.pdf |title=Federal Reserve System: 12 CFR Part 201 |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation of bank affiliates and holding companies==
{{See also|Bank holding company}}
''Transactions Between Member Banks and Their Affiliates (Regulation W)'' regulates transactions, such as loans and asset purchases between banks and their affiliates. The term "affiliate" is broadly defined and includes parent companies, companies that share a parent company with the bank, companies that are under other types of common control with the bank (e.g. by a trust), companies with interlocking directors (a majority of directors, trustees, etc. are the same as a majority of the bank's), subsidiaries, and certain other types of companies. When passed September 18, 1950 Regulation W included a prohibition on installment purchases exceeding 21 months, which was shortened to 15 months on October 16 of the same year.

==2018 deregulation announcement==
In January 2018, a spokesperson for the [[Federal Reserve Board]] [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors|chief of supervision]] said that existing banking sector regulations were too tough and standardized, and could be relaxed and customized in order to promote commercial bank lending, investment, and stock market trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/us/201801201060924997-federal-reserve-wall-street-banking/|accessdate=January 20, 2018|title=Federal Reserve to Deregulate Banking Sector Via Tailored Approach|publisher=Sputnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Randal Quarles]], the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors#Current members|Vice Chairman for Bank Supervision]], said he was planning several imminent changes that Wall Street has wanted involving [[Net capital rule|capital rules]], [[proprietary trading]] and a process known as “living wills” that aims to prevent [[Taxpayer#Taxpayers' money|taxpayer]] [[Bailout#Cases|bailouts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-quarles/feds-quarles-details-steps-to-ease-rules-from-volcker-to-stress-tests-idUSKBN1F82B8|title=Fed's Quarles details steps to ease rules from Volcker to stress tests|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11685">'''Bava Kamma''' ([[Talmudic Aramaic]]: בבא קמא ''Bāḇā Qammā'', "The First Gate") is the first of a series of three [[Talmud]]ic tractates in the order [[Nezikin]] ("Damages") that deal with civil matters such as damages and [[tort]]s. The other two of these tractates are [[Bava Metzia]] and [[Bava Batra]]: originally all three formed a single tractate called ''Nezikin'', each "Bava" meaning "part" or "subdivision". Bava Kamma discusses various forms of damage and the compensation owed for them.

[[Tanakh|Biblical]] laws dealing with the cases discussed in Bava Kamma are contained in the following passages: {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:18–19|HE}}, and {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:24–22:5|HE}}. The principle that underlies the legislation in this respect is expressed by the sentence, "He that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution". {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:5|HE}}

Bava Kamma consists of ten chapters, which may be grouped as follows: damage caused without criminality (chaps. i–vi); damage caused by a criminal act (chaps. vii–x).

==Damage caused without criminality==
:''For post-Talmudic developments, see [[Damages (Jewish law)]]''

Two types of damages are dealt with: (1) damage caused by agents in their normal condition; (2) damage caused by agents in their abnormal condition. An instance of the first class of agents is an ox treading upon things that are in his way and thus damaging them, or eating things that are in his path. An instance of the second class is the case of a Goring Ox, as under normal circumstances an ox does not gore.

===Agents in their normal condition===
The Mishnah identifies four heads or agents of damage ("''avot nezikin''", literally, parents of damages): '''Ox''', '''Pit''', '''Ma'Aveh''' (meaning either damages caused by man, or those caused by an animal's feeding), '''Burning''' ("''Shor''," "''Bor''," "''Mav'eh''," "''Hev'er''"). These four agents correspond to those mentioned in {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:4|HE}} [R. V. 5], {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:33–34|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:4–5|HE}} [A. V. 5–6].

The law concerning the compensation in these cases is expressed in the Mishnah (i. 1) thus: "These four agents have in common the circumstance that they usually cause damage; that the owner has the duty to prevent the damage; and that if he fails to do so, on damage being done he must pay full compensation, with the best of his property" (compare {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:4|HE}} [A. V. 5]). Before, however, giving the detailed regulations for these four kinds of damage, the Mishnah proceeds to the discussion of the second class of damages, those caused by agents in an abnormal condition.

===Agents in their abnormal condition===
The principal distinction in the second class is between '''harmless''' ("''tam''") and '''warned''' ("''mu'ad''"). The law of compensation in these two cases is as follows: In the case of an animal previously reputed harmless (''tam''), the owner has to compensate for half the damage, unless half the damage exceeds the whole value of the animal causing the damage. In a case where the owner has been warned (''mu'ad''), he must give full compensation for the damage, without regard to the value of the damaging animal (compare {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:35–36|HE}}).

The law of ''mu'ad'' applies to the four kinds of damage done by animals or agents in their normal condition. In addition to these the Mishnah (i. 4) enumerates the following: man, and wild beasts owned by a man—such as the wolf, the lion, the bear, and the leopard; also the serpent. Of man it is said, "Man is always fully responsible (''mu'ad''), whether he cause damage intentionally or unintentionally, whether awake or asleep" (ii. 6). This rule is illustrated by various instances given in the third chapter (1–7).

===Damage by grazing or burning===
The remaining part of the third chapter, the fourth, and part of the fifth (1–4), contain regulations concerning the compensation for damage caused by a goring ox. Following the order of the ''avot nezikin'' given in the beginning of the tractate, the damage caused by a pit is discussed in the second part of the fifth chapter; and the sixth chapter is devoted to the remaining two causes of damage, grazing (1–3) and burning (4–6). Of the last section the following law is noteworthy:

:"If a [[camel]] laden with [[flax]] passes through a street, and the flax catches fire from a candle that is inside a shop so that the whole shop is thereby set on fire, the owner of the camel is held responsible for the damage; if, however, the candle is outside the shop, the owner of the shop is responsible. The exemption to this liability is in the case of [[Hanukkah]] lights, as per Rabbi Yehuda's opinion".

==Damage caused by criminal acts==
There are three types of damages caused by a criminal act: (1) by theft (ch. vii.); (2) by violence (ch. viii.); (3) by robbery (ch. ix.–x.).

(1) "If a man steal an ox or a lamb and slaughter the same or sell it, five cattle shall he pay for the ox and four sheep for the lamb" ({{bibleverse||Exodus|21:37|HE}}). The regulations as to how to apply this law under various circumstances are contained in chapter vii. 1–6.

(2)  The compensation for injuries as the result of violence is discussed in chapter viii. Such compensation includes five items: for the permanent loss ("''nezeḳ''"), if any, in earning capacity; loss of time ("''shebet''"); pain ("''ẓa'ar''"); cost of the cure ("''rippuy''"); and insult ("''boshet''"). The scale of compensation for an insult, as given in the Mishnah, seems to indicate the maximum compensation, for the Mishnah adds, "The principle is that the amount depends on the injured man's station in life." [[Rabbi Akiva]], however, opposed this principle, and desired to have one measure for all. A practical case decided by Rabbi Akiva is then cited (viii. 7). In addition to all the compensation paid, the offender must beg the injured man's pardon.

(3) He who has robbed his neighbor, and desires to make restitution, pays the full value of the thing taken and a fine of one-fifth of its value. ({{bibleverse||Lev|5:21–24|HE}} [A. V. vi. 2–5]). If the things taken by robbery have undergone a change, he pays according to the value the things had at the time of the robbery (ch. ix.). The last chapter considers cases in which the things taken are no longer in the hands of the robber, and concludes with the warning not to buy things suspected to be stolen. With the exception of chap. vii. 7 (on certain restrictions with regard to the rearing of cattle or poultry in Palestine), there are neither ''halakic'' nor ''haggadic'' digressions in this tractate.

==Talmud Yerushalmi and Talmud Bavli==
There are two versions of Bava Kamma: One is within ''[[Talmud Yerushalmi]]'', while the other is in ''[[Talmud Bavli]]''. The two Gemaras, as usual, discuss the laws of the Mishnah; the Jerusalem Talmud rather briefly, the Babylonian Talmud more fully.

The following are a few of the principles enunciated in the Gemara: According to Symmachus (Sumkus, not to be confused with [[Symmachus the Ebionite]]): Property concerning which there is a doubt whether it belongs to A or to B, is divided between A and B without either being compelled to confirm his claim by oath. The sages (''chachamim'') hold that he who claims what is in the possession of another, must prove his claim (''hamotzi machavaro aluv haria'')(B. Ḳ. 46a). A person attacked on his own grounds may take the law into his own hands, when the delay caused by going to a proper court of law would involve great loss. Whenever the whole value of the damaged object is paid, the payment is considered as compensation ("mamona"); when only half the value or a certain fixed amount is paid, the payment is considered a fine ("kenasa") (B. Ḳ. 15b). The judges in Babylonia had no right to impose a fine for any offense; the case had to be tried by qualified judges in Palestine.

The following incident will illustrate the last two rules: A man was charged before Rab Ḥisdai (in Babylonia) with having struck a fellow man with his spade. Rab Ḥisdai asked Rab Naḥman how much the offender had to pay. The latter replied that no fine could be imposed in the Babylonian courts, but that he desired to know the facts of the case. He ascertained that A and B had together a well, each of them with the right of drawing water on certain fixed days alone. Contrary to the agreement A drew water on a day that was not his. B noticed it and drove him away with his spade. Rab Naḥman's verdict was that B might with impunity have hit A a hundred times with the spade, as any delay would have involved a great loss to B (B. Ḳ. 27b). It is noteworthy that two codes of law are mentioned: the legal one ("dine adam," literally, judgments of man) and the moral one ("dine shamayim," literally, judgments of heaven). In some cases the former absolves man of an obligation, and the latter does not (Mish. vi. 4; Gem. 29a, 56a, and passim).

==Aggadic elements==
* (a) A "ḥasid" (pious man) noticed a man throwing stones and rubbish from his own garden into the public thoroughfare. The ḥasid rebuked him, saying, "Why do you throw these things from a place that is not yours into a place that is yours?" The man laughed; but he soon learned the true meaning of the question. For he had to sell his property, and one day, walking in the street, he met with an accident through these very stones (50b).
* (b) [[Joshua]], on dividing the land of [[Canaan]] amongst the tribes of Israel, made the tribes agree to ten conditions, the most important of which are the common use of the forests as pasture for cattle, and the common right of fishing in the Sea of Tiberias (81a).
* (c) [[Ezra]] introduced ten rules ("teḳanot"), among them the reading of a section of the Pentateuch on Sabbath afternoon ("minḥah"), on Monday and on Thursday, and the holding of the sittings of the court (bet din) on Mondays and Thursdays (82a).
* (d) Two officers were once sent by the Roman governor to Rabban Gamaliel to be instructed in the Jewish law. When they had finished the study they declared to Rabban Gamaliel that the laws (referring probably to the civil code of laws) were all just and praiseworthy, with the exception of two that make a distinction between Jew and heathen. The rabbi thereupon ordered the inequality to be removed (Bab. 38a, and Yer. iv. 4b).
* (e) Rabbi Johanan used to give to his servant part of everything he was eating or drinking, saying, "Is not his Creator also my Creator?" (Job xxxi. 15; Yer. viii. 6c).
* (f) At the funeral of King Hezekiah a scroll of the Law was laid on the bier, with the words, "This [man] fulfilled what is written in this [scroll]" (Bab. 17a).

Some noteworthy explanations of Biblical texts may be added. The words "ḳa'asher yeba'er hagalal" (I Kings xiv. 10) are quoted as meaning (Babli 3a; see Rashi, ad loc.) "as the tooth destroyeth" (A. V. "as a man sweepeth the dung"). "Erek appayim" ("slow to anger," Ex. xxxiv. 6) is interpreted "long-suffering to both the righteous and the wicked" (ib. 50b), on account of the dual form. A Biblical verse is quoted according to its sense and not literally, as, for example (ib. 81b; compare B. M. 76a), "mihyot ṭob al tiḳḳare ra'" (when thou art kind, thou shalt not be called bad); then the question is raised, "Is it written so?" and the verse Prov. iii. 27 is cited.

The '''Blackstone Legal Fellowship''' is an American legal training and internship program developed and facilitated by Christian legal group [[Alliance Defending Freedom]] (ADF). Since its inception in 2000, more than 1,900 law students have participated in the program. Its main campus is in Scottsdale, Arizona. Notable faculty have included U.S. Court of Appeals Judge [[Amy Coney Barrett]].

==Overview==
[[File:SirWilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sir William Blackstone in 1774]]

Blackstone Legal Fellowship is a highly competitive, nine week intensive summer legal training program which spans June though August. It was founded in 2000 for the purpose of preparing Christian law students for professional legal careers. The first class comprised 24 interns.&lt;ref name="dexter" /&gt; Since its inception Blackstone has trained more than 1,900 Christian law students.&lt;ref name="adf blackstone"/&gt; In an interview, ADF co-founder [[Alan Sears]] said in 2000 Blackstone was created in response to his observation, "There’s got to be a better way for law students in America and for young lawyers than we currently have."&lt;ref name="mcfeely"/&gt; The program is made up of interns, called Fellows, from a diverse selection of law schools as well as elite institutions such as Harvard and Yale.&lt;ref name="dexter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dexter|first1=Duggan|title=How tomorrow’s legal activists start the journey with a trip to Arizona|url=https://arizonadailyindependent.com/2014/02/16/how-tomorrows-legal-activists-start-the-journey-with-a-trip-to-arizona/|work=Arizona Daily Independent|accessdate=January 31, 2018|date=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is named for [[Sir William Blackstone]], the famed eighteenth century English legal scholar and jurist whose influential commentaries on the common law had a profound impact on the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Bailyn"&gt;Bailyn, Bernard, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution'' (2017 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2012, Sears was asked about the major achievements of ADF. He said "among the things I am most thankful for are our Blackstone Legal Fellowship graduates."&lt;ref name="mcfeely"&gt;McFeely, Tom (January 18, 2012). "[http://m.ncregister.com/daily-news/alliance-defense-funds-chief-convert#.WeI8BIUpDYV Alliance Defense Fund's Chief Convert]". ''[[National Catholic Register]]''. Retrieved February 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, President [[Donald Trump]]'s nominee to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], [[Amy Coney Barrett]], was criticized by Senator [[Al Franken]] for teaching constitutional law at Blackstone. In her Senate committee hearing he referred to ADF as a "hate group". Barrett responded that the hate group label is "controversial". Barrett was confirmed to the court by the full Senate.&lt;ref name="gottry" /&gt;

==Program information==
The Blackstone Fellowship consists of three phases described as Learn, Lead, and Defend. Fellows spend the first two weeks of the program in the classroom studying in areas such as ethics, theology and jurisprudence. Sessions consist of lectures as well as hands-on interactive presentations.&lt;ref name="dexter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grebing"&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Grebing|editor1-first=Karen|title=Blackstone Legal Fellowship Preparing AMSL Students to be Leaders of the Future|journal=Ave Maria School of Law Advocate|issue=Fall 2013|pages=22–23|url=https://issuu.com/avemarialaw/docs/final_fall_2013_advocate/22|accessdate=February 5, 2018|publisher=Ave Maria School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second phase of the program focuses on six-week field placements at a variety of venues across the United States and abroad including "public-interest law firms, attorneys, law professors, think tanks, and public-policy organizations." Placements are selected based on students' aptitude and career goals.&lt;ref name="dexter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grebing"/&gt;

Finally, the Fellows return to ADF in Scottsdale for a week long series of presentations focusing on career development and professional networking. Speakers include legal academics, members of the judiciary, elected representatives, and practicing attorneys. Interns are given an orientation to the Blackstone alumni network.&lt;ref name="dexter"/&gt;

==Cost==
The cost of attendance at Blackstone is $6,300. Most Blackstone Fellows receive a scholarship to attend the program. In addition, stipends are available to cover expenses during the placement phase of the program.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dexter"/&gt;

==Copyright of art on a cake==
Cakes can be an artistic medium for displaying any image or portraying any character. If a cake is used as an artistic medium for presenting copyrighted content, then copyright issues might come into play with a cake as with any other publication medium. Entertainment media organizations including [[Disney]], [[Lucasfilm]], and [[Sanrio]] have asserted that cakes should not portray their copyrighted fictional characters or their copyrighted images without licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morran|first1=Chris|title=Disney, Lucasfilm, Sanrio Sue Makers Of Counterfeit Marvel, Star Wars, Hello Kitty Cake Frosting|url=https://consumerist.com/2015/09/04/disney-lucasfilm-sanrio-form-legal-alliance-to-take-down-makers-of-counterfeit-marvel-star-wars-hello-kitty-cake-frosting/|website=[[Consumerist]]|accessdate=25 January 2017|date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ernesto|title=Pastry Shops Targeted Over Copyright Infringing "Star Wars" and "Minion" Cakes - TorrentFreak|url=https://torrentfreak.com/pastry-shops-targeted-over-copyright-infringing-star-wars-and-minion-cakes-160115/|website=TorrentFreak|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shirky|first1=Clay|authorlink1=Clay Shirky|title=Copyright cops crack down on cooks over cakes|url=http://boingboing.net/2005/06/16/copyright-cops-crack.html|website=Boing Boing|accessdate=25 January 2017|date=16 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=Eriq|title=Disney Sues Over Edible Cake Frosting Featuring Marvel, Lucasfilm Characters|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sues-edible-cake-frosting-820032|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=25 January 2017|language=en|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright on cake design==
Cake design is an imagining of a cake as copyrightable art, like a [[sculpture]].

Bakeries which provide cakes which critics have ridiculed for low quality have sometimes sought to claim copyright over their cakes.&lt;ref name="Masnick 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masnick|first1=Mike|title=The Cake Copyright Is A Lie; Safeway Just Doesn't Want To Be Mocked|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121112/02460021013/cake-copyright-is-lie-safeway-just-doesnt-want-to-be-mocked.shtml|website=Techdirt|accessdate=25 January 2017|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The copyright claim is part of an attempt to enforce demands that communities of people who mock cakes not publish photos of cakes for entertainment.&lt;ref name="Masnick 2012"/&gt;

'''''Communitas perfecta''''' ("perfect community") or '''''societas perfecta''''' ("perfect society") is the [[Latin]] name given to one of several [[ecclesiology (Catholic Church)|ecclesiological]], [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]], and [[political philosophy|political theories]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. The doctrine teaches that the church is a self-sufficient or independent group which already has all the necessary resources and conditions to achieve its overall goal (final end) of the universal salvation of mankind. It has historically been used in order to define church–state relations and to provide a theoretical basis for the legislative powers of the church in the [[philosophy, theology, and fundamental theory of canon law|philosophy of canon law]].

==''Communitas perfecta'' in Aristotle==
Its origins can be traced to the [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']] of [[Aristotle]], who described the ''Polis'' as a whole made of several imperfect parts, i.e. the consummation of natural communities such as the family and the village.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'' book I chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; The "perfect community" was originally developed as a theory of political society. The most sovereign political organization (the Polis)  can attain the end of the community as a whole (happiness) better than any of the subordinate parts of the community (family, village, etc.). Since it can attain its end (''telos'') by its own powers and the resources within itself, then it is self-sufficient. It is self-sufficiency that is the defining element of the polis.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Politics book I chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholastic development==
{{see also|Treatise on Law}}
The idea of "perfect community" was also present in [[medieval philosophy]]. In direct reference to Aristotle, [[Thomas Aquinas]] mentions the state (''civitas'')&lt;ref&gt;The translation of "civitas" with "state" at this point, see Aroney, Nicholas, "Subsidiarity, Federalism and the Best Constitution : Thomas Aquinas on City, Province and Empire. "Law and Philosophy, Vol 26, pp.&amp;nbsp;161–228, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as a perfect community (''communitas perfecta''):&lt;ref&gt;[[Summa]] I-II q 90 a 3 (English: [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2090.htm NewAdvent.org])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As one man is a part of the household, so a household is a part of the state: and the state is a perfect community, according to Polit. i, 1. And therefore, as the good of one man is not the last end, but is ordained to the common good; so too the good of one household is ordained to the good of a single state, which is a perfect community. Consequently he that governs a family, can indeed make certain commands or ordinances, but not such as to have properly the force of law.&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theologiæ Ia-IIæ q.90 rep. obj. 3 http://sacred-texts.com/chr/aquinas/summa/sum228.htm, accessed 8 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aquinas never referred to the church as a perfect community in his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Graham, S.J., ''Vatican Diplomacy: A Study of Church and State on the International Plane'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1959) pg. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; If Aquinas and medieval writers had any notion of ''communitas perfecta'' being applied to the church, it was not clearly expressed and was not a clear basis for the ''societas perfecta'' theory used in later controversies between church and state.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Graham, S.J., ''Vatican Diplomacy: A Study of Church and State on the International Plane'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1959) pg. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magisterial adoption==
{{see also|Philosophy, theology, and fundamental theory of canon law}}
During [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment period]], the ''Societas Perfecta'' doctrine was strongly affirmed in order to better protect the church from secular encroachments. It was also mentioned in the magisterium of the Thomistic revivalist pontiffs such as [[Pius IX]]. And especially [[Leo XIII]], in his [[encyclical]] ''[[Immortale Dei]],''  explains this teaching in relation to the church: 

{{quote|It is a perfect society of its own kind and their own right, since it everything for their existence and their effectiveness is necessary, in accordance with the will and power of the [[Divine grace|grace]] of their Founder in and of itself owns. As the goal of the Church is more sublime, its power is always far superior, and it can therefore not be considered less than the Civil state, as to not be in a state of subordination.&lt;ref &gt;Leo XIII.: Circular "Immortale Dei" in: Human and Community Christlicher review, Freiburg (Switzerland) 1945, pp.&amp;nbsp;571–602, paragraph 852&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The two perfect societies correspond to two forces, the church and state: 

{{quote|The one responsible for the care of the divine dimension, the other for the human. Each one is in the highest of its kind: each has certain limits within which it moves, borders that emerged from the nature and purpose of each of the next two forces showed.&lt;ref&gt;Leo XIII.: Circular "Immortale Dei" in: Human and Community Christlicher review, Freiburg (Switzerland) 1945, pp.&amp;nbsp;571–602, paragraph 857&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Developments in the post-conciliar period==
Until the [[Second Vatican Council]], the doctrine of the two perfect societies of Leo XIII was held to be official in theological studies. During the council itself, as well as in the new ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]'' itself, the doctrine was no longer explicitly mentioned and the Aristotelian "Perfect Community" was all but replaced by the biblical "[[People of God]]". In the modern Catholic post-conciliar theology, its discussion is limited to theologians and academics. Its near-abandonment in discourse has proven controversial.

In any event, [[Pope Paul VI]] mentioned it and summarized it in the 1969 ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''[[Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum]]'' on the tasks of the [[papal legate]]: 

{{quote|It cannot be disputed that the duties of Church and State belong to different orders. Church and state are in their own area perfect societies. That means: They have their own legal system and all necessary resources. They are also, within their respective jurisdiction, entitled to apply its laws. On the other hand, it must not be overlooked that they are both aiming at a similar welfare, namely that the people of God is to obtain eternal salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Listl, Church and State, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This theology was largely overshadowed by the biblical theology of the church as the ''[[mystici corporis Christi]]'' (mystical body of Christ), which began to be more fully developed in the early 20th century and was affirmed by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, 1943 encyclical ''Mystici Corporis Christi''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crown Attorneys''' or '''Crown Counsel''' (or, in [[Alberta]] and [[New Brunswick]], '''Crown Prosecutors''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.ab.ca/organization/justice_system.aspx?id=3182 Alberta Justice page on Crown Prosecutors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/ag-pg/PDF/en/PublicProsecutionOperationalManual/Policies/Interpretation.pdf New Brunswick Public Prosecutions Operational Manual]&lt;/ref&gt; are the prosecutors in the [[Canadian law|legal]] system of [[Canada]].

Crown Attorneys represent [[the Crown]] and act as [[prosecutor]] in proceedings under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] and various other statutes. Criminal prosecutions pursuant to federal statutes other than the Criminal Code, such as the ''[[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]]'', the ''[[Incomes in Canada|Income Tax Act]]'', and others, are generally (but not exclusively) conducted by the [[Public Prosecution Service of Canada]], which also handles most narcotic case outside of Quebec and New Brunswick. There are similarities between this role and the [[Procurator Fiscal]] in [[Scotland]], [[Crown Prosecutor]] in [[England and Wales]] and [[United States Attorney]] or [[District Attorney]] in the [[United States]]. Crown Attorneys are not elected. They are [[civil servants]] and may be removed from their positions pursuant to their employment agreements.

Although the enactment of criminal law is under federal jurisdiction in Canada, the prosecution of most Criminal Code offences—outside of the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut—is the responsibility of the provincial [[Attorneys General]] and their lawful deputies by virtue of the administration of justice powers found in Section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and the "interpretation" section of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 2, definition of "Attorney General."&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the vast majority of Crown Attorneys are employed by Canada's ten provinces.

Lawyers who act on [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[Public administration|administrative]] matters for the Provincial Crown are not referred to as Crown Attorneys ([[Senior General Counsel]], [[General Counsel]]), or simply Crown Counsel although both criminal and civil attorneys generally report to the provincial [[Attorney-General]]'s office. Lawyers who work for the Federal Ministry of Justice are often referred to as Crowns even if acting in Civil Matters. Moreover, [[lawyers]], [[articling student|students-at-law]] and other persons who only represent the Crown on provincial offences matters (such as municipal [[by-law]] enforcement and traffic offences) are referred to as "Provincial Prosecutors" or "Provincial Offences Attorneys" (POAs) rather than Crown Attorneys. Regardless of whether the prosecuted matter is a criminal offence or a provincial offence, Crown Attorneys represent and argue on behalf of [[the Crown]]. In the province of Ontario, there is only one ''Crown Attorney'' appointed by the Attorney General per judicial district. The Crown Attorney is charged with supervising the office at the local level, and has a level of autonomy from the Attorney General's office. A Crown Attorney will then, in consultation with the Attorney General's office, hire ''Assistant Crown Attorneys'' to further staff the office and prosecute offences. In this respect, Ontario functions similar to the US system of [[District Attorneys]] and [[Assistant District Attorney]]s, although within the aspects of the Canadian legal system.

As Crown Attorneys are not elected, the Canadian prosecutorial system is often seen as less politically motivated than other systems.

'''Dickinson Law Review''' is the flagship [[law review]] of [[Penn State Dickinson Law]]. Founded in 1897 as ''The Forum,'' it is the fifth oldest law review in continuous print in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Dickinson Law Review |url=https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/lawreview |publisher=Penn State Dickinson Law |accessdate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Dickinson Law School merged with [[Penn State University]] in 2003, the name of the periodical was changed to the ''Penn State Law Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsl.psu.edu/journals/lawreview.cfm |title=Penn State Law Review |accessdate=2008-10-14 |last=The Penn State Dickinson School of Law |first= |coauthors= |date=2008 |work= |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022013033/http://www.dsl.psu.edu/journals/lawreview.cfm |archivedate=2008-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the separation of the [[Penn State Law]] and Penn State Dickinson Law campuses into separately-accredited [[law schools]] in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/faqs-separate-accreditation|title=FAQs on Separate Accreditation|date=2014-06-12|work=Penn State Law {{!}} University Park, Pa.|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the periodical was renamed Dickinson Law Review, while the [[Penn State Law Review]] was retained by Penn State Law.

A '''direct-action lawsuit''' is brought directly against an [[insurance company]] for a wrong done by the insured.  

In a [[lawsuit]] that is not direct-action, a [[plaintiff]] brings the [[Cause of action|claim]] against the insured, who actually wronged the plaintiff.  Once [[Legal judgment|judgment]] has been rendered against the [[defendant]], there are a number of ways that the insurance company (assuming the defendant is insured) might later be made to pay the victorious plaintiff.

If the plaintiff wants to avoid the extra time and process required to eventually be paid by the insurance company, the action can be brought directly against the insurance company.  The plaintiff must still prove all of the same facts that would be the plaintiff's burden, had the action been brought against the insured.  In addition, the plaintiff must prove that the insured was covered by the insurance company, and that the [[insurance policy]] covered the kind of wrong for which the plaintiff is seeking remedy.  The insured is then treated as a third party to the litigation, and the insurance company itself is the defendant.

This name can also be given to any lawsuit that is brought as a kind of [[direct action]] activism. One example can be a customer suing a company to repeal an action deemed an infringement on the rights of the customer as a citizen and thus a subject to federal or state law. 

Allegedly, the largest direct-action lawsuit was the subject matter of the motion picture ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]''.

As a [[research doctorate]], it follows professional training in law ([[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] or [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) and the first graduate degree in law ([[Master of Laws]]). It is primarily aimed at educating professors, legal scientists, and other scholars in law.

The program begins with a combination of required and elective coursework. Then, upon passage of the oral exam, the student advances to doctoral candidacy. Completion of the program requires a dissertation, which serves as an original contribution to the scholarly field of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsadmissions/index.aspx?id=196 |title=Tulane Law School Prospective Students |publisher=Law.tulane.edu |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2416">'''Double actionability''' is a doctrine of [[private international law]] which holds that an action for an alleged [[tort]] committed in a foreign jurisdiction can be successful in a domestic court only if it would be actionable under both the laws of the home jurisdiction and the foreign jurisdiction.  The rule originated in the controversial case of ''[[Phillips v Eyre]]'' (1870) LR 6 QB 1.

The rule is no longer used in [[Canadian law]] and instead the ''[[lex loci delicti]]'' rule is used.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tolofson v. Jensen]]'' [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the rule no longer forms part of [[Australian law]] which also uses the ''[[lex loci delicti]]'' rule.&lt;ref&gt;''[[John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson]]'' (2000) 203 CLR 503&lt;/ref&gt;  This rule holds that the applicable law for a tort committed in a foreign place will be the tort law of the foreign place.

It remains used in New Zealand tort law.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Baxter v RMC Group plc]]'' [2003] 1 NZLR 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Though its continued existence has been called into question, with many suggesting it should be replaced with a rule similar to that of Canada's.

The rule has largely been abandoned in English law by virtue of section 10 of the [[Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/42/contents|title=Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[English defamation law|defamation claims]] are specifically excluded (cf. section 13(1)).  However, even prior to it being abandoned the courts had increasingly distanced themselves from the rule by applying a "flexible exception".  The exception was first applied in ''[[Boys v Chaplin]]'' [1969] 2 All ER 1085 and expanded upon in ''[[Red Sea Insurance v Bouygues SA]]'' [1995] 1 AC 190.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conflictoflaws.net/2006/forum-non-conveniens-and-choice-of-law-in-tort-equity-in-the-singapore-court-of-appeal/|title=Forum Non Conveniens and Choice of Law in Tort &amp; Equity in the Singapore Court of Appeal|author=Martin George|date=11 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The EB-5 visa provides a method of obtaining a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] for foreign nationals who invest  in a "new commercial enterprise"&lt;ref name="savills-studley_EB5_2015"/&gt;{{rp|2}} in the United States. The EB-5 program "affords foreign nationals and their spouses and unmarried children under age 21 the ability to obtain a U.S. visa based solely upon a minimum investment in a for-profit enterprise that creates or retains a specified number of jobs".&lt;ref name="savills-studley_EB5_2015"/&gt;{{rp|1}} To obtain the visa, individuals must invest $1,000,000 (or at least $500,000 in a [[Targeted Employment Area]] - high unemployment or rural area), creating or preserving at least 10 jobs for U.S. workers excluding the investor and their immediate family.&lt;ref name="USCIS_2012_green_card" /&gt;

If the foreign national investor's petition is approved, the investor and their dependents will be granted conditional permanent residence valid for two years.&lt;ref name="EB-5 Immigrant Investor Process" /&gt; Within the 90-day period before the conditional permanent residence expires, the investor must submit evidence documenting that the full required investment has been made and that 10 jobs have been maintained, or 10 jobs have been created or will be created within a reasonable time period.&lt;ref name="EB-5 Immigrant Investor Process" /&gt;

Commercial real estate projects result in job creation through construction work at first and eventually in the service industry, for example in hotels, restaurants, resorts and/or stadium development. For that reason, many of the EB-5 visa investments "target commercial real estate".&lt;ref name="savills-studley_EB5_2015"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

==EB-5 investment projects==
Hotel and multi-use developments financed with EB-5 investments include Hilton, Hyatt Hotels, Marriott's, Starwood's SLS Hotel &amp; Casino.&lt;ref name="savills-studley_EB5_2015"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

==History==
Congress created the employment-based fifth preference category (EB-5) visa program in 1990 to "create jobs for U.S. workers and to infuse new capital into the U.S. economy".&lt;ref name="chapmanlawreview_Lin_2015"/&gt;{{rp|528}} At that time the program was directed towards "alien entrepreneurs" who would not only invest $1 million or $500,000 in a "new commercial enterprise" but would also "engage in the management of the new enterprise" creating ten full-time jobs for U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.&lt;ref name="chapmanlawreview_Lin_2015"/&gt;{{rp|528}} In order to make the program more investor-friendly, Congress enacted the 1993 Appropriations Act which amended the EB-5 program to create the "Pilot Immigration Program" — the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program (IIPP).&lt;ref name="chapmanlawreview_Lin_2015"/&gt;{{rp|528}}&lt;ref name="EB-5 Regional Center"&gt;{{cite web | title = EB-5 Regional Center| accessdate = 2011-11-17| url = http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=2785a5f224a2e210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=2785a5f224a2e210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD| author = U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services | publisher=[[USCIS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the IIPP, foreign nationals could invest in a pre-approved regional center, or "economic unit [referred to as regional centers], public or private, which is involved with the promotion of economic growth, including increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, or increased domestic capital investment".&lt;ref name="EB-5 Regional Center" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chapmanlawreview_Lin_2015"/&gt;{{rp|529}} Investments within a regional center provide foreign nationals the added benefit of allowing them to count jobs created both directly and indirectly for purposes of meeting 10-job creation requirement.&lt;ref name="EB-5 Regional Center" /&gt; This was intended to help potential investors to meet "the program's stringent requirements" through passive investment.&lt;ref name="chapmanlawreview_Lin_2015"/&gt;{{rp|529}} With the IIPP, the EB-5 visa became an investor's visa as opposed to an entrepreneur's visa.&lt;ref name="chapmanlawreview_Lin_2015"/&gt;{{rp|530}}

In c.1995 former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officials formed a company called AIS that acted as intermediaries between INS and immigrant entrepreneurs in the EB-5 program. Whereas EB-5 required an investment of $500,000 AIS only required $125,000 cash with the rest — $375,000 in the form of a promissory note. AIS claimed the promissory note would "be forgiven once the immigrant's permanent residency application was approved". The U.S. immigration agency, which was then known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), had interpreted the regulations regarding financial qualifications in a way that accepted this arrangement until c. 1998 when they were under investigation by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO). There were allegations that the INS was giving preferential treatment to AIS in EB-5 matters. The INS (now USCIS) changed their "interpretation of regulations regarding financial qualifications"&lt;ref name=Office2005/&gt; as a result of the probe. In 1997 and 1998 two owner-operators of Interbank, [[Herndon, Virginia]] had "filed 320 false [EB-5] applications on behalf of 270 EB-5 immigrant investors.&lt;ref name="WP_2000"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2000/08/12/2-accused-of-immigration-investment-fraud/b7478173-023a-402d-b4c8-6ea377dfc7d7/ |title=2 Accused of Immigration, Investment Fraud |first=Brooke A. |last=Masters |date=August 12, 2000 |access-date=May 9, 2017 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The INS raided Interbank in August 1998.&lt;ref name="WP_2000"/&gt; The EB-5 program was temporarily suspended.&lt;ref name="Brookings_Improving_EB5"/&gt;{{rp|11}} Although no one in AIS or INS were charged, in 2000 the two Interbank operators were arrested, then convicted and imprisoned on dozens of counts of "money-laundering and fraud" in the largest case of EB-5 fraud.&lt;ref name="Brookings_Improving_EB5"/&gt;{{rp|11}} INS District Director Warren A. Lewis said, "Visa fraud whether done on the streets by selling fraudulent cards or through an elaborate financial scheme is against the law and will be investigated and prosecuted."

According to a [[Brookings Institution]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation]] 2014 report, starting in 2008 there was a renewed interest in the "under-utilized" EB-5 visa program as the number of "wealthy investors" and "ultra-wealthy individuals" in emerging markets abroad increased and the access to "traditional domestic financing" in the United States had decreased because of the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]].&lt;ref name="Brookings_Improving_EB5"&gt;{{cite report |work=[[Brookings Institution]] |title=Improving the EB-5 Investor Visa Program: International Financing for U.S. Regional Economic Development |series=Brookings-Rockefeller Project on State and Metropolitan Innovation |first1=Audrey |last1=Singer |first2=Camille |last2=Galdes |date=February 2014 |access-date=May 9, 2017 |pages=26 |location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

By 2010, foreign investors' use of the EB-5 program was far less than Congress had originally anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Residence in the United States through Investment: Reality or Chimera? | year = 2010 | journal = Albany Government Law Review

Initially, under the first EB-5 program, the foreign investor was required to create an entirely new commercial enterprise; however, under the Pilot Program investments can be made directly in a job-generating commercial enterprise (new, or existing - "Troubled Business"&lt;ref name="EB-5 Immigrant Investor Process"&gt;{{cite web|title=EB-5 Immigrant Investor Process|url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=8bf89ea1c35be210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=8bf89ea1c35be210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD|publisher=[[USCIS]]|access-date=May 9, 2017 |date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or into a regional center - a 3rd party-managed investment vehicle (private or public), which assumes the responsibility of creating the requisite jobs. Regional centers may charge an administration fee for managing the investor's investment and a "percentage of what they raise from the developers" which amounts to millions on large projects.&lt;ref name="Fortune_2014_Nicholas Mastroianni" /&gt;

The program reached capacity for the first time in August 2014 when the State Department stopped issuing EB-5 visas until the beginning of the next fiscal year, October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/Immigrant-Statistics/China%20Employment%20Fifth%20Preference.pdf |format=PDF |work=Bureau of Consular Affairs via [[United States Department of State]] |deadurl=yes |title=Immigrant Statistics: China Employment Fifth Preference |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013235005/http://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/Immigrant-Statistics/China%20Employment%20Fifth%20Preference.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, the number of EB-5 visas granted had more than doubled since 2009.&lt;ref name="Fortune_2014_Nicholas Mastroianni"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/14/eb-5tangled-past/ |title=The tangled past of the hottest money-raiser in America's visa-for-sale program |authors=Peter Elkind and Marty Jones |date=October 14, 2014 |access-date=May 7, 2017 |work=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased interest from Chinese millionaire families===
According to the Savills Studley 2015 report, in 2011 out of a total of 3,463 EB-5 Visas granted, 2,408 of them — representing 69.5% — were from Chinese nationals. By 2014 out of a total of 10,692 EB-5 Visas granted, 9,128 of them — representing 85.4% — were from Chinese nationals.&lt;ref name="savills-studley_EB5_2015"/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_EB-5_Trump_2016" /&gt; The authors of the report conclude that the "increase in the number of applicants to the EB-5 program has stemmed from an increase in interest from mainland Chinese".&lt;ref name="savills-studley_EB5_2015"/&gt;{{rp|6}} As China's economy flourished, there was an increase in the number of millionaire families in China. In 2012 there were 1.5 million, by 2013 there were 2.4 million which is more than the number of millionaire families in Japan.&lt;ref name="savills-studley_EB5_2015"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

A June 2014 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' article claimed that, "after years of industry pressure, it's now USCIS policy to automatically accept any state designation of a TEA, even though states routinely approve gerrymandered districts that tack on distant high-unemployment tracts to allow EB-5 endeavors in wealthy areas".&lt;ref name="fortune_visa4sale_2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/07/24/immigration-eb-5-visa-for-sale/|title = The dark, disturbing world of the visa-for-sale program|last = Elkind|first = Peter|last2 = Jones|first2 = Marty|date = July 24, 2014|access-date = March 10, 2015|publisher = ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''}} paraphrased in [[Targeted Employment Area]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marriott International|Marriott]] EB-5-funded construction projects have been criticized for acquiring TEA status for wealthy and well-off regions including in [[Washington D.C.]], contradicting the original spirit of the TEA designation.&lt;ref name="WCP_2014_TEA_EB5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fortune_visa4sale_2014" /&gt; In June 2014 when the $520 million-Marriott Marquis convention center hotel—D.C.'s new largest hotel—was officially opened on June 10, 2014 by Mayor [[Vince Gray]], who announced [[Air China]]'s maiden first direct flights between D.C. and Beijing.&lt;ref name="WCP_2014_TEA_EB5" /&gt; and hoped the Air China passengers would "stay in the Marriott Marquis".&lt;ref name="WCP_2014_TEA_EB5"/&gt; In a June 27 article ''[[Washington City Paper]]'' reported that it was "fitting" that Air China passengers stayed in the Marriott Marquis because they invested $5 million through the federal EB-5 visa program "earning green cards in the process".&lt;ref name="WCP_2014_TEA_EB5"/&gt; In the same article, other recent "major D.C. development projects using EB-5 funds" including Shaw's CityMarket at O development that "used $97 million of EB-5 funding" and earned "green cards for nearly 200 foreigners".&lt;ref name="WCP_2014_TEA_EB5"/&gt; A top priority of Mayor Gray's administration was to nurture a "stronger business relationship with China, the primary source of EB-5 funding in D.C. and nationally".&lt;ref name="WCP_2014_TEA_EB5"/&gt;

In 1994 the first two regional centers were established and by 2007 there were sixteen. As the banking crisis worsened and access to capital became difficult, the number of approved regional centers proliferated. At the end of FY 2007 there were only 11 USCIS-approved regional centers.&lt;ref name="USCIS_Regional_Centers_May_2017"/&gt; In 2008 the RCs "nearly doubled" and their numbers mushroomed since then.&lt;ref name="Brookings_Improving_EB5"/&gt;{{rp|5}} By February 2, 2015, there were approximately 630&lt;ref name="savills-studley_EB5_2015"/&gt;{{rp|9}} and by May 1, 2017, there were 883.&lt;ref name="USCIS_Regional_Centers_May_2017"/&gt; Many of them operate in multiple states.&lt;ref name="savills-studley_EB5_2015"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

By 2015 the RC program had "generated billions of dollars in capital investment and created tens of thousands of jobs across the country".&lt;ref name="Leahy_2015"/&gt; By 2015, RC applications represented over 95% of all EB-5 investments.&lt;ref name="savills-studley_EB5_2015"/&gt;{{rp|2}} EB-5 investors who use RC intermediaries are "free of the day-today active management of a business".&lt;ref name="savills-studley_EB5_2015"/&gt;{{rp|2}} but they lose on the rate of return.

In June 2015 Senators [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-Vt) and [[Chuck Grassley]] (R-Iowa) introduced legislation to "extend and significantly improve the job-creating immigrant investor visa program" and re-authorize the "EB-5 Regional Center program".&lt;ref group=note&gt;The proposed Leahy-Grassley legislation, — ''The American Job Creation and Investment Promotion Reform Act'' — was intended to address challenging issues in EB-5, such by " strength[ing] oversight, ensur[ing] greater accountability and transparency, discourag[ing] fraud, and provid[ing] a higher priority for national security ... The bill bolsters the Department of Homeland Security's authorities to administer the program, and provides investors with greater protections and more information about their investments.  It also increases transparency and oversight and provides DHS the ability to proactively investigate fraud, both in the United States and abroad, using a dedicated fund paid for by certain program participants.  The bill would also raise the amount of investment required and help to restore the program to its original intent, by ensuring that much of the capital generated and jobs created occur in rural areas and areas with high unemployment." According to ''The New York Times'', "Supporters of the EB-5 program, including real estate developers, spent as much as $3 million to help defeat [the Grassley-Leahy legislation] intended to address fraud and national security concerns."&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Leahy said that, since 2005, the EB-5 program had "create[d] jobs and provide[d] access to capital in communities in Vermont and throughout the country, all at no cost to American taxpayers".&lt;ref name="Leahy_2015"/&gt; Senator Grassley added, "The EB-5 regional center program was created to benefit American communities through investment and job creation.

==Kushner Companies May 2017 controversy ==

Starting on May 6, 2017, a number of major media outlets began raising concerns about ethical implications regarding the way in which the EB-5 program was promoted to potential Chinese investors by Kushner Companies in May 2017, considering [[Jared Kushner]]'s pivotal and influential role in the Presidency of Donald Trump, his father-in-law. Chinese investors were shown a photo of Donald Trump in the marketing slide show to suggest the ease of getting a green card.&lt;ref name="NYT_Kushner_May_2017_EB5"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/business/trump-kushner-china-investors-visas.html?_r=0 Trump Looms as Kushner Companies Courts Investors in China] By Keith Bradsher, Ailin Tang and Jesse Drucker May 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost_visa"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-a-beijing-ballroom-kushner-family-flogs-500000-investor-visa-to-wealthy-chinese/2017/05/06/cf711e53-eb49-4f9a-8dea-3cd836fcf287_story.html |title=In a Beijing ballroom, Kushner family pushes $500,000 'investor visa' to wealthy Chinese |work=The Washington Post |date=May 6, 2017 |access-date=May 7, 2017 |author=Emily Rauhala and William Wan |location=Beijing }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters_Kushner_May_2017_EB5"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-kushner-idUSKBN1830E7 Reporters barred from Kushner Companies' event in China]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' headlined with "Trump and Kushner exploitation of presidency 'unlike anything we have ever seen before'.&lt;ref name="independent_Kushner_May_2017_EB5"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-and-jared-kushners-exploitation-of-presidency-unlike-anything-we-have-ever-seen-before-a7722996.html Trump and Kushner exploitation of presidency 'unlike anything we have ever seen before', Obama's ethics lawyer says: Norm Eisen tweeted remark while sharing link to story about Jared Kushner's sister highlighting family ties while wooing Chinese investors Samuel Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects ==
A 2015 study found that the EB-5 investor visa program boosted investment in the United States during the Great Recession of 2008 to 2012.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simons|first=R.

The '''Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939''' was emergency legislation passed just prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]] by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to enable the [[British Government]] to take up [[emergency powers]] to prosecute the war effectively. It contained clauses giving the government wide powers to create [[Defence Regulations]] which regulated almost every aspect of everyday life in the country. Two offences under the regulations were punishable with death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Butler|editor1-first= T.R.F.|editor2-last= Garsia|editor2-first= M.|last= |first= |date= 1943|title= [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]|edition= 31st|url= |location= |publisher= |pages= 1524{{en dash}}1525|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passage==
The Act was passed in reaction to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi–Soviet Pact]] of 23 August 1939 and provided the government with powers from 24 August 1939. It was originally intended to be in force for only one year,{{sfn|Jennings|1940|p=132}} and made general provision for prosecuting the war effort. In particular, it provided for the following:

{{cquote|'''1'''. (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, His Majesty may by Order in Council make such Regulations (in this Act referred to as "Defence Regulations") as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for securing the public safety, the defence of the realm, the maintenance of public order and the efficient prosecution of any war His Majesty may be engaged, and for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community.

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by the preceding subsection, Defence Regulations may, so far as appears to His Majesty in Council to be necessary or expedient for any of the purposes mentioned in that subsection:-

(a) Make provision for the apprehension, trial, and punishment of persons offending against the Regulations and for the detention of persons whose detention appears to the Secretary of State to be expedient in the interests of the public safety or the defence of the realm;

(b) authorise -
:(i) the taking of possession or control, on behalf of His Majesty, of any property or undertaking;
:(ii) the acquisition, on behalf of His Majesty, of any property other than land;

(c) authorise the entering and searching of any premises; and

(d) provide for amending any enactment, for suspending the operation of any enactment, and for applying any enactment with or without modification.
}}

==Extension of powers==
The Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1940&lt;ref&gt;3 &amp; 4 Geo. 6, c. 20&lt;/ref&gt; extended the 1939 Act for another year, and provided for annual extensions by parliamentary resolution.{{sfn|Jennings|1940|p=132}} It significantly extended the Government's powers under the Defence Regulations to require persons "to place themselves, their services and their property at the disposal of His Majesty."{{sfn|Jennings|1940|p=132}}

The Emergency Powers (Defence) (No. 2) Act 1940&lt;ref&gt;3 &amp; 4 Geo. 6, c. 45&lt;/ref&gt; enabled the creation of special courts to administer criminal justice in war zones, as well as authorizing them to punish offenders for violating the Defence Regulations.{{sfn|Jennings|1940|p=133}}

==Repeal==
The Act was repealed on 25 March 1959 by the Emergency Laws (Repeal) Act, 1959,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1959/19%20/pdfs/ukpga_19590019_en.pdf Emergency Laws (Repeal) Act, 1959], 7&amp;8 Eliz. 2, c. 19, Fourth Schedule (Part I)&lt;/ref&gt; but the last of the Defence Regulations did not expire until 31 December 1964.&lt;ref&gt;1959 Act, s. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-Being''' ({{lang-ru|Федеральная служба по надзору в сфере защиты прав потребителей и благополучия человека}}) or '''Rospotrebnadzor''' ({{lang-ru|Роспотребнадзор}}) is the federal service responsible for Supervision of [[consumer rights]] Protection and Human Well-Being in Russia. The service is submissive and was included into the structure of the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health Care]] of Russia till 2012. This service was founded in 2004. Since May  2012 Rospotrebnadzor was excluded from the Ministry of Health and reports directly to the Russian Government. It functions on the base of the Act of Federal Service on the base of the Administrative Regulation.

==History==
Organization's history goes back to the Decree of the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR "On the sanitary authorities of the Republic" dated 15 September 1922.
 
Up to 2004 in Russia in 2218 functioned sanitary-epidemiological stations (centers).
 
The current structure of the organization founded by the [[decree of the President of Russia]] on March 9, 2004 № 314 "On the system and structure of federal bodies of executive power". Subordinated to the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health]]. In accordance with the presidential decree of May 21, 2012 № 636 "On the system and structure of federal executive bodies" under the direct authority of the Government of Russia. Since the establishment of the Federal Service (2004) is led by GG Onishchenko. 
 
All the organs and institutions of the Federal Service currently employs approximately 110,000 professionals.

== Rospotrebnadzor and permissive documents==

Rospotrebnadzor in the plan of regulating of the state functions connected with the technical regulation, evaluation of conformity or other kinds of state regulating performs the following functions:

* Performs the sanitary control, control and issuing some kinds of permissive documents;
* Performs licensing of certain kinds of activities;
* Performs certification of different objects of evaluating of conformity to Russian legislation. 
* Performs sanitary certification of production according to the requirements of the Customs Union;
* Performs state registration of production of the RF (excepting medicaments);
* Performs state registration of production of the Customs Union on the territory of Russia (with the exception of pharmaceuticals).

Even listing the kinds of activities of Rospotrebnadzor, connected with drawing up different kinds of permissive documents makes a significant list. Let’s give more details about some certain directions while receiving permissive documents.

==Permissive documents in the plan of sanitary control and supervision==

Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are issued in the form of Permit for exploitation of buildings and premises. This document testifies about the fact that the premises conforms to the requirements to performing a certain kind of activity and providing some kind of service. This document is obligatory for receiving for owners of restaurants and cafes, food shops and swimming pools, children's preschool, school institutions, medical cabinets and clinics, by providing hair-dresser, laundry and other similar institutions.

The function of permissive document is brought by negotiation of the Program of Industrial Control of an object of any legal entity or an individual entrepreneur that applied to Rospotrebnadzor in order to draw up a sanitary conclusion or permit for exploitation or in other cases. This Program appears to be the plan of sanitary measurements of an organization or institutions that allow meet all the requirements of the Russian sanitary legislation.

==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by licensing==

It is clear that such kind of permissive documents is called a license, that is drawn up after performing an analysis of the documents presented before the body of licensing, that prove performing all the requirements of licensing set for the certain kind of activities.

Rospotrebnadzor is authorized to draw up permissive documents for the following directions of licensed kinds of entrepreneurship:

* Activities connected with application of provocatives of infection diseases;
* Activities connected with application of sources of [[ionizing]] radiation.

Issuing different kinds of documents is performed both by territorial bodies of Rospotrebnadzor and its central apparatus depending on the class of danger of apparatus of ionizing radiation and the class of danger of provocatives of infection diseases. Drawing up permissive documents is primarily required for meeting requirements of the Federal Law “About Sanitary Well Being of the population of the RF”.

==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by performing certification in the sphere of sanitary safety==

The kind of drawn up permissive documents primarily depends on the object suffering evaluation of conformity. So, for many kinds of production it was required to draw up the sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion. The SEC, this was the widely known name of thus famous document. But from 1 July 2012 issuing of these permissive documents was stopped. They were replaced by the [[Certificate of State Registration]] of the Customs Union and the Expert Conclusion.

The Expert Conclusion is not the direct analog of the SEC. Earlier, until 1 July 2010, the mandatory sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion (SEC) or [[hygienic]] certificate for realization both Russian and foreign goods were required for the most part of production on the [[Russian market]].  All the children’s goods, all the production that we eat, drink or wear, or all that we use in our everyday life underwent the mandatory evaluation of conformity to SNiPs or SanPins. After the moment that the legislation of the [[Customs Union]] went into force, for some groups of goods that may do the most significant harm with their unquality, it became necessary to prove the conformity with the help of the unified requirements of the CU by means of drawing up of the [[Certificate of State Registration]] of the CU.

In the same document, that states the list of such production (Decision of the CU Commission 299 of 28 May 2010) in the first part there is a list of the goods for which by crossing the border of the RF (CU) there can be the necessity of sanitary-epidemiologic control. In this case for this kind of production we’ll need the hygienic certificate – the Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor.

The Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor unlike the SEC appears to be the voluntary document. As the situation of the sanitary control may occur or may not occur. The reason why the customs services may require sanitary documents and going through hygienic control of the load may be as follows:

Injured cartridge, conveyor or other kind of package in which transportation of the load is performed;
Mismatch between documents and loads detected;
There is information about breaking that is connected with given delivery, about mismatch between the documents and the contents of the transport units and in some other cases.

==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by performing the sanitary supervision of the Customs Union (CU)==

The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are mandatory to draw up for the production included into the List of the goods to go through sanitary control by crossing the border of the CU, that was approved by the Commission of the CU on 18 July 2010.

If the production is included into the first part of this document, so the kind of the permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor is the Expert Conclusion. If the production is included into the second part of the document, so the kind of the document of Rospotrebnadzor is the Certificate of State Registration of the CU.

The both documents are possible to be received only on the base of the Expert Conclusion after the performed certification tests, done by the certification laboratory (having authorization of the CU). They prove that the studied product meets the Unified sanitary requirements of the three countries the Union members.

Such documents must be received also for these kinds of Russian production if they are firstly manufactured for realization on the market of the [[Customs Union]].

The volume of the production items for which it is required the following permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor is reduced nearly ten times in comparison with the list of goods for which it is necessary to draw up the SEC and (or) the Certificate of State Registration of the RF.

In the cases that the production went through the sanitary supervision on the base of the Russian Sanitary Rules and in the present it needs drawing up the sanitary permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor in accordance with the requirements of the legislation of the CU, bet nevertheless the customs inspection requires the document of proof, but also it is necessary to apply to Rospotrebnadzor.

In such situations you will receive the drawn up the Exemption Letter of Rospotrebnadzor. But the information, which it usually comprises, is of the general legislative character (it can be read in the laws of the CU). That is why the consultants recommend draw up the Expert Conclusion of Rospotrebnadzor in such cases.

==Permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor by State registration of production==

The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor were issued till the end of 2012 for the production that in accordance with the national legislation required its inclusion into the State Registry before its start of realization on the territory of the RF.

The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor drawn up on the blank of the Certificate of State Registration of the RF will be valid on the territory of Russia till the end of the year.

==The permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor of State Registration of the CU==

Such a document is drawn up from 1 July 2010 and is called the Certificate of State Registration of the CU. On which it is required to draw up the given permissive documents. The above-mentioned article describes it.

As the [[Certificate of State Registration]] of the CU replaced two earlier existing Russian documents proving the sanitary safety of production and duplicating each other. Earlier entrepreneurs had to go through the same procedure of proving conformity of production to sanitary requirements of the Russian legislation twice. The Certificate of the CU replaced the Sanitary-Epidemiologic Conclusion and the Certificate of State Registration of the RF.

{{Financial risk types}}
{{Finance sidebar}}

'''Financial risk''' is any of various types of [[risk]] associated with [[finance|financing]], including [[financial transaction]]s that include company loans in risk of [[default (finance)|default]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialrisk.asp#axzz1b9QLCKIO|accessdate=1 October 2011|publisher=Investopedia|title=Financial Risk: Definition | date = 2018-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/hmwsw/financial_risk|publisher=Credo Reference|year=2003|title=In Wall Street Words | accessdate = 1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often it is understood to include only [[downside risk]], meaning the potential for financial loss and uncertainty about its extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantitative risk management: concepts, techniques and tools|first1=Alexander J.|last1=McNeil|first2=Rüdiger|last2=Frey|first3=Paul|last3=Embrechts|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-691-12255-7|pages=2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of financial risk management|first1=Karen A.|last1=Horcher|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2005|isbn=978-0-471-70616-8|pages=1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A science has evolved around [[financial risk management|managing market and financial risk]] under the general title of [[modern portfolio theory]] initiated by Dr. [[Harry Markowitz]] in 1952 with his article, "Portfolio Selection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markowitz|first=H.M.|date=March 1952|title=Portfolio Selection|journal=The [[Journal of Finance]]|volume=7|issue=1|pages=77–91|doi=10.2307/2975974|jstor=2975974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern portfolio theory, the [[variance]] (or [[standard deviation]]) of a portfolio is used as the definition of risk.

==Types==

===Asset-backed risk===
Asset-backed risk is the risk that changes in one or more assets that support an [[asset-backed security]] will significantly impact the value of the supported security.  Risks include interest rate, term modification, and [[Prepayment of loan|prepayment]] risk.

===Credit risk===
{{Main|Credit risk}}

Credit risk, also called ''default risk'', is the risk associated with a borrower going into [[default (finance)|default]] (not making payments as promised).  Investor losses include lost [[principal sum|principal]] and [[interest]], decreased [[cash flow]], and increased [[collection cost]]s.  An investor can also assume credit risk through direct or indirect use of [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]].  For example, an investor may purchase an investment using [[Margin (finance)|margin]].  Or an investment may directly or indirectly use or rely on [[Repurchase agreement|repo]], forward commitment, or [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments.

===Foreign investment risk===
Foreign investment risk is the risk of rapid and extreme changes in value due to: smaller markets; differing [[Accountancy|accounting]], [[Financial statement|reporting]], or [[Financial audit|auditing]] standards; [[nationalization]], [[Confiscation|expropriation]] or confiscatory taxation; [[Economic sanctions|economic conflict]]; or political or diplomatic changes.  Valuation, liquidity, and regulatory issues may also add to foreign investment risk.

===Liquidity risk===
{{Main|Liquidity risk}}
{{See also|Liquidity}}

This is the risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss (or make the required profit). There are two types of liquidity risk:
*''Asset liquidity'' – An asset cannot be sold due to lack of liquidity in the market – essentially a sub-set of market risk.  This can be accounted for by:
**Widening [[bid-offer spread]]
**Making explicit liquidity reserves
**Lengthening holding period for [[value at risk|VaR]] calculations
*''Funding liquidity'' – Risk that liabilities:
**Cannot be met when they fall due
**Can only be met at an uneconomic price
**Can be name-specific or [[systemic risk|systemic]]

===Market risk===
{{Main|Market risk}}

The four standard market risk factors are equity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, and commodity risk:
* [[Equity risk]] is the risk that [[share price|stock prices]] in general (not related to a particular company or industry) or the [[implied volatility]] will change.
* [[Interest rate risk]] is the risk that [[interest rate]]s or the implied volatility will change.
* [[Currency risk]] is the risk that [[exchange rate|foreign exchange rates]] or the implied volatility will change, which affects, for example, the value of an asset held in that currency.
* [[Commodity risk]] is the risk that [[commodity]] prices (e.g. corn, copper, crude oil) or implied volatility will change.

===Operational risk===
{{Main|Operational risk}}
Operational risk means the risk that a company or individual has to face due their own operation and decisions made for the investment

===Other risks===
*[[Reputational risk]]
*[[Legal risk]]
*[[IT risk]]

==Diversification==

{{Main|Diversification (finance)}}

Financial risk, market risk, and even inflation risk can at least partially be moderated by forms of [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].

The returns from different assets are highly unlikely to be perfectly correlated and the correlation may sometimes be negative. For instance, an increase in the price of oil will often favour a company that produces it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7535787.stm | work=BBC News | title=Another record profit for Exxon | date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but negatively impact the business of a firm such an airline whose variable costs are heavily based upon fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/16/idUKN16550720110516 | work=Reuters | first=John | last=Crawley | title=U.S. airline shares up as oil price slides | date = 16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, share prices are driven by many factors, such as the general health of the economy which will increase the correlation and reduce the benefit of diversification.
If one constructs a portfolio by including a wide variety of equities, it will tend to exhibit the same risk and return characteristics as the market as a whole, which many investors see as an attractive prospect, so that [[index fund]]s have been developed that invest in equities in proportion to the weighting they have in some well-known index such as the FTSE.

However, history shows that even over substantial periods of time there is a wide range of returns that an index fund may experience; so an index fund by itself is not "fully diversified". Greater diversification can be obtained by diversifying across asset classes; for instance a portfolio of many bonds and many equities can be constructed in order to further narrow the dispersion of possible portfolio outcomes.

A key issue in diversification is the [[correlation]] between assets, the benefits increasing with lower correlation. However this is not an observable quantity, since the future return on any asset can never be known with complete certainty. This was a serious issue in the [[late-2000s recession]] when assets that had previously had small or even negative correlations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eurojournals.com/irjfe_35_14.pdf|title=The Impacts of Extreme Events of Dynamic Interactions on Interest Rate, Real House Price and Stock Markets|journal=International Research Journal of Finance &amp; Economics|year=2010|issue=35|p=187|author1=Hsiu-Jung Tsai|author2=Ming-Chi Chen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930040053/http://www.eurojournals.com/irjfe_35_14.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; suddenly starting moving in the same direction causing severe financial stress to market participants who had believed that their diversification would protect them against any plausible market conditions, including funds that had been explicitly set up to avoid being affected in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://web.mit.edu/Alo/www/Papers/august07.pdf | title=What Happened To The Quants In August 2007?∗ | author=Amir E. Khandani|author2=Andrew W. Lo | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversification has costs. Correlations must be identified and understood, and since they are not constant it may be necessary to rebalance the portfolio which incurs transaction costs due to buying and selling assets. 
There is also the risk that as an investor or fund manager diversifies, their ability to monitor and understand the assets may decline leading to the possibility of losses due to poor decisions or unforeseen correlations.

==Hedging==
{{Main|Hedge (finance)}}
[[Hedge (finance)|Hedging]] is a method for reducing risk where a combination of assets are selected to offset the movements of each other.
For instance, when investing in a stock it is possible to buy an option to sell that stock at a defined price at some point in the future. The combined portfolio of stock and option is now much less likely to move below a given value. As in diversification there is a cost, this time in buying the option for which there is a premium. [[Derivative (finance)|Derivatives]] are used extensively to mitigate many types of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm|title=Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=www.chicagofed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17432">In [[aviation]], a '''flight information region''' ('''FIR''') is a specified region of [[airspace]] in which a [[flight information service]] and an [[alerting service]] (ALRS) are provided. It is the largest regular division of airspace in use in the world today. FIRs have existed since 1947 at least.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26442500 |title=Record Strait Traffic Due Today|newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=24 December 1947 |accessdate=23 January 2014 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69433443 |title=Ensuring safety of air routes. |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]] |location=Burnie, Tas. |date=4 February 1953 |accessdate=23 January 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every portion of the atmosphere belongs to a specific FIR. Smaller countries' airspace is encompassed by a single FIR; larger countries' airspace is subdivided into a number of regional FIRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Bhalotra, Y. P. R | author2=Botswana. Department of Meteorological Services | title=Gaborone flight information region requirements for meteorological service | publication-date=1990 | publisher=Director, Meteorological Services | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/179875769 | accessdate=23 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-23/us-drone-over-australia/5215598 "Ex-military spy drone to conduct NASA climate tests in Australian airspace"] ''[[Australian Broadcasting Company|ABC News]]'' (24 January 2014) re: Brisbane, Queensland, Australia FIR – "Airservices Australia today confirmed that the NASA Global Hawk would conduct tropospheric research in Brisbane's Flight Information Region (FIR).Brisbane's FIR covers an area including northern New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory and northern Western Australia plus airspace over the north and north eastern oceans"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some FIRs encompass the territorial airspace of several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Jeziorski, Andrzej | title=South Pacific Forum pushes for unified flight information region | journal=Flight International | publication-date=1999-03-10 | publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd | pages=14(1) | issn=0015-3710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oceanic airspace is divided into Oceanic Information Regions and delegated to a controlling authority bordering that region. The division among authorities is done by international agreement through the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).

There is no standard size for FIRs – it is a matter for administrative convenience of the country concerned. In some cases there is a vertical division of the FIR, in which case the lower portion remains named as such, whereas the airspace above is named [[Upper Information Region]] (UIR).

An information service and alerting service are the basic levels of air traffic service, providing information pertinent to the safe and efficient conduct of flights and alerting the different relevant authorities should an aircraft be in distress. These are available to all aircraft through a FIR. Higher levels of Air Traffic Advisory and Control services may be available within certain portions of airspace within a FIR, according to the ICAO class of that portion of airspace (with regard to national regulations), and the existence of a suitably equipped authority to provide the services.

'''William Grady Ward''' (born April 4, 1951) is an [[Export of cryptography in the United States|American]] software engineer, lexicographer, and Internet activist who has featured prominently in the [[Scientology versus the Internet]] controversy.

==Biography==

Prior to his opposition to Scientology practices, Grady Ward compiled the [[Moby Project]], an extensive compilation of English language lexical resources and in 1996 released it to the public domain. One of its components, Moby Thesaurus, has more than 2.5 million synonyms and related words, making it the largest thesaurus in the English language as of early 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3202|title=Moby at Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Ward was known for compiling and distributing a public domain version of the complete works of William Shakespeare, ''Moby Shakespeare'', which has been credited as being the most widely distributed works of Shakespeare in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shaksper.net/archives/2004/1098.html|title=Moby Shakespeare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchors|shocking_nonsense}}In 1993, his publisher, the Austin Code Works, was investigated for the [[Export of cryptography in the United States|export of strong cryptography]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.06/eword.html|title=Wired's article on US Government investigation of cryptography export}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US government at the time treated cryptographic software above a certain strength as the legal equivalent of munitions and restricted them accordingly. Ward spent time developing source code fragments collectively called Moby Crypto to encourage the pervasive development of programs containing state-of-the-art cryptography. Ward also promoted the idea of creating secure, memorable pass-phrases through "shocking nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~conrad/krypto/passphrase-faq.html|title=Passphrase FAQ}}— "'Shocking nonsense' means to make up a short phrase or sentence that is both nonsensical and shocking in the culture of the user, that is, it contains grossly obscene, racist, impossible or other extreme juxtaposition of ideas. This technique is permissible because the passphrase, by its nature, is never revealed to anyone with sensibilities to be offended."&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March 1995 he aided in the distribution of an [[National Security Agency|NSA]] employee handbook when it was leaked by the on-line magazine ''[[Phrack]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theory.stanford.edu/~donald/NSA.doc.html|title=EFF resources on the NSA Employee Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that, if the government could not keep safe its own materials, then there was no reason for anyone to trust them to maintain a secure key escrow scheme the NSA had proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/Privacy/Key_escrow/|title=EFF resources on key-escrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the Church of Scientology sued Ward,&lt;ref&gt;C 96-20207 RMW N.D. California, San Jose&lt;/ref&gt; alleging that he was responsible for anonymous postings of material to which the Church claimed copyright. After several years of litigation in which Ward defended ''pro per'' ''[[in forma pauperis]]'' and responded to more than 1000 docket items in the Northern District of California, San Jose, the lawsuit was eventually settled on 12 May 1998. Ward prevailed on the Church's trade secret claim resulting in a dismissal with prejudice, but agreed to a stipulated judgement on Scientology's copyright claim. Without a finding of liability by Ward, he agreed to pay Scientology $200 a month for life. Unusually for legal settlements with the Church of Scientology, the settlement was not secret, and contained no restrictions on what Ward could say about Scientology. The settlement itself became a source of ongoing legal dispute with two appeals to the [[Ninth Circuit]] [[United States courts of appeals|Court of Appeals]], but to date it has not been violated by either party.&lt;ref&gt;RTC v Ward settlement agreement before US District Judge Jeremy Fogel, May 12, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2012, Grady Ward published a novel, ''The Celestial Instructi0n'', detailing a fictional attack on the United States information infrastructure. In 2012, his niece, K. E. Ward, also an author, published a novel, ''The Heart Grows Stronger''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ASIN|B007A80V18|title=The Celestial Instructi0n|date=2012-07-29}}

''' Incentive stock options''' (ISOs), are a type of [[employee stock option]] that can be granted only to employees and confer a [[Taxation in the United States|U.S. tax benefit]].  ISOs are also sometimes referred to as '''incentive share options''' or '''Qualified Stock Options''' by [[IRS]] &lt;ref&gt;TITLE 26 - INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, Subtitle A - Income Taxes, CHAPTER 1 - NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES, Regulations § 422 Incentive stock options&lt;/ref&gt; 
.

The tax benefit is that on exercise the individual does not have to pay ordinary income tax (nor employment taxes) on the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares issued (however, the holder may have to pay U.S. [[Alternative Minimum Tax|alternative minimum tax]] instead). Instead, if the shares are held for 1 year from the date of exercise and 2 years from the date of grant, then the profit (if any) made on sale of the shares is taxed as long-term capital gain. Long-term capital gain is taxed in the U.S. at lower rates than ordinary income.
 
Although ISOs have more favorable tax treatment than non-ISOs (a.k.a. non-statutory stock option (NSO) or [[non-qualified stock option]] (NQO or NQSO)), they also require the holder to take on more risk by having to hold onto the stock for a longer period of time if the holder is to receive optimal tax treatment. However, even if the holder disposes of the stock within a year, it is possible that there will still be marginal [[tax deferral]] value (as compared to NQOs) if the holding period, though less than a year, straddles the ending of the taxpayer's taxable reporting period.

Note further that an employer generally does not claim a corporate income tax deduction (which would be in an amount equal to the amount of income recognized by the employee) upon the exercise of its employee's ISO, unless the employee does not meet the holding-period requirements.  ''But see'' Coughlan, Section 174 R&amp;E Deduction Upon Statutory Stock Option Exercise, 58 Tax Law. 435 (2005).  With NQSOs, on the other hand, the employer is always eligible to claim a deduction upon its employee's exercise of the NQSO.

Additionally, there are several other restrictions which have to be met (by the employer or employee) in order to qualify the compensatory [[stock option]] as an ISO. For a stock option to qualify as ISO and thus receive special tax treatment under Section 421(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), it must meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Code when granted and at all times beginning from the grant until its exercise. The requirements include:

* The option may be granted only to an employee (grants to non-employee directors or independent contractors are not permitted), who must exercise the option while he/she is an employee or no later than three (3) months after termination of employment (unless the option holder is disabled, in which case this three-month period is extended to one year. In case of death the option can be exercised by the legal heirs of the deceased until the expiration date).
* The option must be granted under a written plan document specifying the total number of shares that may be issued and the employees who are eligible to receive the options. The plan must be approved by the stockholders within 12 months before or after plan adoption.
* Each option must be granted under an ISO agreement, which must be written and must list the restrictions placed on exercising the ISO. Each option must set forth an offer to sell the stock at the option price and the period of time during which the option will remain open.
* The option must be granted within 10 years of the earlier of adoption or shareholder approval, and the option must be exercisable only within 10 years of grant.
* The option exercise price must equal or exceed the fair market value of the underlying stock at the time of grant.
* The employee must not, at the time of grant, own stock representing more than 10% of voting power of all stock outstanding, unless the option exercise price is at least 110% of the fair market value and the option expires no later than five (5) years from the time of the grant.
* The ISO agreement must specifically state that ISO cannot be transferred by the option holder other than by will or by the laws of descent and that the option cannot be exercised by anyone other than the option holder.
* The aggregate fair market value (determined as of the grant date) of stock bought by exercising ISOs that are exercisable for the first time cannot exceed $100,000 in a calendar year. To the extent it does, Code section 422(d) provides that such options are treated as non-qualified stock options.

In [[property law]], '''ingress, egress, and regress''' are the [[rights]] of a person (such as a [[lessee]]) to enter, leave, and return to a [[property]], respectively.

In a sale and purchase contract, it means that the buyer gets full rights to insure the property according to Standard A.

[[Image:Staple Inn, London, UK - 20050821.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Staple Inn]], the only Inn of Chancery building to survive largely intact]]
The '''Inns of Chancery''' or '''''Hospida Cancellarie''''' were a group of buildings and legal institutions in London initially attached to the [[Inns of Court]] and used as offices for the clerks of [[court of equity|chancery]], from which they drew their name. Existing from at least 1344, the Inns gradually changed their purpose, and became both the offices and accommodation for [[solicitors]] (as the [[Inns of Court]] were to barristers) and a place of initial training for [[barristers]].

The practice of training barristers at the Inns of Chancery had died out by 1642, and the Inns instead became dedicated associations and offices for solicitors. With the founding of the [[Society of Gentlemen Practisers]] in 1739 and the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] in 1825, a single unified professional association for solicitors, the purpose of the Inns died out, and after a long period of decline the last one ([[Clement's Inn]]) was sold in 1903 and demolished in 1934.

==History==
The Inns of Chancery evolved in tandem with the [[Inns of Court]]. During the 12th and early 13th centuries the law was taught in the [[City of London]], primarily by the clergy. But during the 13th century an event occurred which ended legal education by the Church. A [[papal bull]] in 1218 prohibited the clergy from practising in the secular, [[common law]] courts. As a result, law began to be practised and taught by laymen instead of by clerics. To protect their schools from competition, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] issued proclamations prohibiting the teaching of the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] within the City of London.&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; These schools were based in hostels or "inns", which later took their name from the landlord of the inn in question.&lt;ref name=watt5&gt;Watt (1928) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Furnival's.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Early-18th-century engraving of Furnival's Inn by Sutton Nicholls]]
The Inns of Chancery sprung up around the Inns of Court, and took their name and original purpose from the [[court of equity|chancery]] clerks, who used the buildings as hostels and offices where they would draft their writs.&lt;ref name=steel586&gt;Steel (1907) p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; As with the Inns of Court the precise dates of founding of the Inns of Chancery are unknown, but the one commonly said to be the oldest is [[Clifford's Inn]],&lt;ref name=s590&gt;Steel (1907) p. 590&lt;/ref&gt; which existed from at least 1344.&lt;ref name="inns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innertemple.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=36%3Ainns-court&amp;catid=22%3Ahistorical-articles&amp;Itemid=30&amp;limitstart=1|title=The Inns Of Court And Inns Of Chancery And Their Records|publisher=[[Inner Temple]]|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thavie's Inn]], founded in 1349, is considered to be the next oldest, and several legal historians mistakenly considered it the oldest of them all.&lt;ref name=watt55&gt;Watt (1928) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

For several centuries, education at one of the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a [[barrister]]. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of [[moot court|moots]] and [[rote learning]].&lt;ref name=watt9/&gt; He would also be taught by [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Readers]] sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students.&lt;ref name=watt10&gt;Watt (1928) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of each legal term, particularly promising students would be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education.&lt;ref name=watt10/&gt; By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.&lt;ref name=watt57&gt;Watt (1928) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the Inns of Chancery was used as accommodation and offices by [[solicitor]]s, the other branch of the English legal profession.&lt;ref name="inns"/&gt; During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the purpose of the Inns changed. After the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War]] in 1642, the practice of teaching barristers in the Inns ceased, and as a result the Inns of Chancery became a dedicated association for solicitors instead, offering offices and accommodation. The foundation of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers and [[Law Society of England and Wales]] in 1739 and 1825 respectively as professional bodies for the solicitors profession relegated the Inns of Chancery to little more than eccentric dining clubs, and they were gradually dissolved and sold. In 1897 a popular book reported that nobody could remember the purpose of the buildings and that an 1850 investigation had failed to uncover their origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/legallorecuriosi00andr#page/258/mode/2up|title=Legal lore: curiosities of law and lawyers|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Inn to be sold was [[Clement's Inn]], which was sold in 1903,&lt;ref name="inns"/&gt; and demolished in 1934.&lt;ref name=watt57/&gt;

[[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]] wrote of ten Inns of Chancery, each one attached to an [[Inns of Court|Inn of Court]] "like Maids of Honour to a Princess".&lt;ref name=watt9&gt;Watt (1928) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Only nine are known of in detail;&lt;ref name=loft1&gt;Loftie (1895) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; the other was St George's Inn.&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902), pp. 24-25; 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten Inns were:

* [[Clement's Inn]], [[Lyon's Inn]] and [[Clifford's Inn]] attached to the [[Inner Temple]],
* St George's Inn, [[Strand Inn]], and New Inn attached to the [[Middle Temple]],
* [[Furnival's Inn]] and [[Thavie's Inn]] attached to [[Lincoln's Inn]], and
* [[Staple Inn]] and [[Barnard's Inn]] attached to [[Gray's Inn]].&lt;ref name=steel586/&gt;&lt;ref name=loft1/&gt;

(An eleventh Inn of Chancery, the [[Outer Temple]], was said to exist by the legal historian [[John Baker (legal historian)|John Baker]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2008) p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; This is denied by other writers.&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Many Inns were originally independent of the Inns of Court, and fell in and out of allegiance with them, with some claiming independence right up to the nineteenth century. Most Inns became directly attached to Inns of Court during the sixteenth century, however, when the Inns of Court began charging higher acceptance fees to students trained in independent Inns of Chancery than they did to students trained in "their" Inns of Chancery.&lt;ref name=loft12/&gt;

===Inner Temple attachments===
Clement's Inn was the last to be dissolved, being shut down in 1903. Located near [[St Clement Danes]], the Inn was also named after [[Pope Clement I|Saint Clement]] and took as its coat of arms his, with a large letter C in [[sable]].&lt;ref name=loft12&gt;Loftie (1895) p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings were completely rebuilt in the 19th century in the [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne Style]]. Noted members included [[Edmund Saunders|Sir Edmund Saunders]], and [[William Shakespeare]] made [[Justice Shallow]], a character in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', a member of the Inn. Members were noted as "a wild lot" known for their drinking and parties.&lt;ref&gt;Steel (1907) p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; In its later years the Inn was a poor one, and had no library or chapel, with most of the funds being spent on repairs and maintenance for the building.&lt;ref&gt;Steel (1907) p. 593&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyon's Inn was "a place of considerable antiquity", with records from 1413.&lt;ref name=s590/&gt; Originally a hostel, it was purchased by the inhabitants and turned into an Inn of Chancery. Initially a small but respected Inn that educated people as noted as [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]], Lyon's Inn became a disreputable institution that "perished of public contempt long before it came to the hammer and the pick".&lt;ref name=s591&gt;Steel (1907) p. 591&lt;/ref&gt; By the time it was dissolved it was inhabited only by the lowest lawyers and those struck off the rolls, and when surveyed it was found that it was run by only two Ancients, neither of whom had any idea what their duties were, and the Inn had not dined for over a century.&lt;ref name=s591/&gt; The Inn was dissolved in 1863 and replaced with the third [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Loftie (1895) p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; 

Clifford's Inn was the oldest of the Inns of Chancery, and was first mentioned in 1344.&lt;ref name="inns"/&gt; Although generally considered a dependent of the Inner Temple, its members always maintained that they were independent.&lt;ref name=palmer&gt;Loftie (1895) p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; As a note of that "independence" it became custom for the Inner Temple to send them a message once a year, which would be received but deliberately not replied to.&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; Their coat of arms was a modified form of the Clifford family arms, with "cheque or and azure, a fess gules, a bordure, bezantée, of the third."&lt;ref name=palmer/&gt; Noted students include [[John Selden]]; [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]] was also said to have studied there, but historical records find no evidence of this, and he was always associated with Lyon's Inn more than Clifford's.&lt;ref&gt;Loftie (1895) p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Temple attachments===
The first lawyers to occupy the premises which later became the Middle Temple came from St George's Inn,&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902), pp. 24-25; 238&lt;/ref&gt; arriving by 1346.&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902), pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; The inn was later deserted in favour of New Inn.&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Strand Inn, also called Chester Inn, was the shortest lived of the Inns of Chancery. Founded in the fifteenth century it was pulled down in the 1540s by [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Lord Somerset]] in his role as [[Lord Protector]] so that he could build [[Somerset House]].&lt;ref name=s590/&gt; The students instead went to New Inn, and Strand Inn was absorbed into that Inn. [[Thomas Occleve]] was said to have studied at Strand Inn.&lt;ref name=s590/&gt;

New Inn was founded in the late 15th century on the premises of Our Lady Inn, a hostel.&lt;ref name=s590/&gt; Noted students included [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], who attended New Inn before going to [[Lincoln's Inn]].&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902), pp. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings of New Inn were pulled down in 1902 to make way for a road between [[Holborn]] and the [[Strand, London|Strand]].&lt;ref name=s590/&gt; After the destruction of Strand Inn, New Inn was the only Inn of Chancery left attached to the Middle Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902) p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lincoln's Inn attachments===
[[Furnival's Inn]] was founded before or during the reign of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] and named after the Lords Furnival.&lt;ref name=steel587&gt;Steel (1907) p. 587&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1820s the Inn was completely rebuilt.  Noted tenants include [[Charles Dickens]], who began to write ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' whilst living there.&lt;ref name=mpi&gt;Loftie (1895) p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; The Inn was demolished in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=3 December 1898|title=Furnival's Inn|journal=Notes and Queries|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|volume=9|issue=2|url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/issue_pdf/frontmatter_pdf/s9-II/49.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thavie's Inn was the second oldest Inn of Chancery, and was founded around 1349. It was sold in 1769.&lt;ref name=watt3&gt;Watt (1928) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers from Thavie's Inn were the first to occupy the premises which became Inner Temple in the 1320s.&lt;ref&gt;Bellot (1902), pp. 22-25&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to this, the Inn coat of arms contained a bale of wool.&lt;ref name=douth2&gt;Douthwaite (1886) p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of Elizabeth I it was the largest of the Inns of Chancery, with 145 students and 69 as permanent residents.

'''Insane delusion''' is the [[law|legal]] [[term of art]] in the [[common law]] tradition used to describe a false conception of reality that a [[testator]] of a [[will (law)|will]] adheres to against all reason and evidence to the contrary.  A will made by a testator suffering from an insane delusion that affects the provisions made in the will may fail in whole or in part.  Only the portion of the will caused by the insane delusion fails, including potentially the entire will.  [[Will contest]]s often involve claims that the testator was suffering from an insane delusion. 

An insane delusion is distinct from [[testamentary capacity]].  A testator might be suffering from an insane delusion but otherwise possess the requisite capacity to make a will.  Similarly, an insane delusion is distinct from a mere mistake.  If suffering from an insane delusion, a testator is not subject to change his or her mind regarding the delusion if presented with contrary evidence, whereas a mistake is capable of being corrected if the testator is told the truth.  Additionally, while an insane delusion may cause portions of a will to fail, most courts will not reform or invalidate a will because of a mistake unless it was the result of [[fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Dukeminier &amp; Stanley M. Johanson, ''Wills, Trusts &amp; Estates'', Sixth Edition, Aspen Publishers, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7355-0636-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The insane delusion concept was created in the 1826 British case ''Dew v. Clark''.  In that case, a father believed that his daughter was "the devil incarnate" and disinherited her in his will of 1818.  After her father's death, evidence presented by the daughter showed that she was well known for her good disposition and that her father had falsely told others that he lavished his daughter with praise and wealth.  The [[probate]] court found that the father's mindset when he made the 1818 will was normal in all respects except toward his daughter.  The court found that his thoughts about her, "did and could only proceed from, and be founded in, insanity," a "partial insanity" that only extended to his thoughts about his daughter and caused him to disinherit her.  The court said that this delusion caused the will to fail.&lt;ref&gt;''Dew v. Clark'', 162 Eng. Rep. 410 (Prerog. 1826)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
In the 1854 case [https://books.google.com/books?id=n5u2AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=addington+v.+wilson#PPA81,M1 ''Addington v. Wilson''], the [[Supreme Court of Indiana]] held that a testator who disinherited his daughters because he believed them to be [[witch]]es was not for that reason alone so insane as to deem him incapable of making a valid will.   The court justified its decision by pointing to distinguished jurists and religious figures who affirmed the possibility of [[witchcraft]]; if these people's beliefs did not render them insane, neither did the testator's.&lt;ref&gt;''Addington v. Wilson'', 5 Blackf. (Ind.) 137, 61 Am.Dec. 81 (Sup. Ct. Ind. 1854)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=58393 ''In re Robertson's Estate''] (1948), the [[Supreme Court of Oklahoma]] held that a testator who declared that he had "no children" and "no deceased children" in his will, when he actually had two living children, was suffering from an insane delusion, as the testator had "no rational basis whatsoever" to declare that he had no children.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Robertson's Estate'', 189 P.2d 615 (Okla. 1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Integrated Electronic Litigation System''' (iELS) or '''eLitigation''' (eLit) is an initiative by the [[Judicial system of Singapore|Singapore Judiciary]] to replace the existing [[Electronic Filing System]] (EFS) which has been in use since 2000. EFS was conceived and developed in the mid- to late-1990s, and iELS represents the second phase in implementing technology to enhance the [[litigation]] process in Singapore.&lt;ref name=unpan&gt;http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UNPAN/UNPAN031797.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawnet.com.sg/legal/ln2/comm/PDF/Electronic_Litigation_Roadmap_Paper_2005.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apjrf.com/papers/Prakash_paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
# Launched in January 2013 in Supreme Court of Singapore; a culmination of nearly 5 years of public sector and private sector partnership.
# Two other launches expected before the end of 2013 to bring the Subordinate Courts and Family Court into the eLitigation family.
# Paradigm shift from a document-centric electronic filing system to a case-centric electronic litigation system.
# Two sides of the same coin: Front-End case management for law firms which is a near mirror image of the Back-End case management for the Courts.
# Transparent to the public but the new Back-End in the Courts consolidated disparate systems for a more holistic case management and oversight throughout its lifecycle.
# The simplification of Courts processes coupled with use of electronic forms and enabling of online collaboration between law firms and clients through the online case file is another key evolution in the electronic litigation framework.
# Use of open standards with functionality delivered through commonly used browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and even Google Chrome to law firms, service bureaus, and others who need to do court filings.

==Case Management for Law Firms==
# Use of SingPass, a national Internet authentication system for eGovernment services, for authentication instead of requiring smartcards and readers in EFS. Enables true mobility as no physical device is required (i.e. no smartcard reader).
# Every document is digitally signed and qualifies as an secure electronic record under the Electronic Transactions Act.
# Streamlined filing process consisting of 4 steps: 
:::a. Step One gathers all information relevant to case, parties, and document(s) required for filing;
:::b. Step Two presents the system-generated document(s) for the user to complete and allows the upload any other document(s) required during the filing;
:::c. Step Three concerns making of administrative requests like selection of hearing dates, requests for urgent handling, requests for electronic service of documents and waiver of filing fees;
:::d. Step Four allows the user to check that all are in order before submitting the documents to the Courts.
# User interface borrows from E-mail metaphor for organisation of tasks, notifications, and correspondences - jigsaw pieces that are part of the litigation workflow puzzle.
# A powerful document search built on top of an intelligent index that takes advantage of meta-information captured in the shift to case-centric approach.
# Online case file that presents a unified view of pertinent information. Case summary, party information, documents, hearings, billing data, and notifications are easily accessible in a tabular view.
# Access to case file is allowed as long as case is pending. Law firms can also save the whole case file as a PDF using the Pack-N-Go functionality.
# Future ability to interface with Legal Practice Management Systems to enable bulk filing of documents, e.g., bankruptcy applications, in the works.

==Case Management for Courts==
# Users in the Courts - Justices, Registrars, and Registry Staff, all have access to case files that are nearly mirror images of those seen by the law firms. Court internal documents like minute sheets and other sealed documents will not be accessible to the law firms.
# The streamlined 4-step process in the Front-End allows for auto-acceptance of certain documents and automatic scheduling of hearings which cuts down on manual work.
# Auto-routing of documents based on legislation or nature of case, amongst other criteria, enables the intelligent distribution of work to the various departments which increases efficiency in the processes of the Courts. 
# The use of checklists for filings e.g. probate, winding up and judicial management, allow for a finer-grained approach to document verification, acceptance, and rejection if required.
# The presence of alerts and notifications assist the users in the timely completion of various tasks throughout the lifecycle of a case.

==Electronic Hearings==
# Hearing fixture management is built into eLitigation. Automated publication of hearing lists to queue management and electronic signage systems within the court house and hearing lists on the web site (to be released soon).
# Electronic hearing can be done from within eLitigation and it interfaces with an electronic queue management and display system. During a hearing, the relevant documents and minute sheet are automatically opened for ease of use.
# Where relevant, customised minute sheets will auto-generate Court documents which are automatically synchronised to the law firms involved.

==Litigation Process Re-engineering==
# Simplification of procedures through removal of requests, changes to [http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=97 Rules of Court], and [http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=98 Practice Directions].
# Use of electronic form technology allows for pre-populated draft summonses and subsequently draft orders after a hearing.
# Law firms are able to choose hearing dates before Registrars.
# Pre-population of prescribed prayers for (a) certain applications where prayers are prescribed by statute and (b) ex-parte applications commonly dealt with by registrars.
# Standardisation of prayers for common applications.
# Use of checklists for some applications.

==eDiscovery==
# Ability for law firms to create Teams for assignment of Lawyers, Paralegals, and Filing Clerks. 
# Team and User Profiles can be fine tuned for case file access in order to enable collaboration within the law firm, and in some instances, with opposing law firms.
# Relevant work items, alerts, and notifications will be sent to the relevant people working on the cases. 
# Documents can be served electronically to another law firm that is an eLitigation user.
# Cause Book Searches based on new fee model.

==Future-proofing==
Disruption to the local legal profession is a foregone conclusion:
# There will be downward pricing pressure for routine work.
# Globalisation and entry of foreign law practices.
# Advances in automatic document assembly aided by the emergence of Natural Language Processing.

It would be wise for a technological leap to punctuate the evolution of electronic litigation in Singapore in order to assist the legal ecosystem to mitigate the disruptive forces at play.

'''Konstantin Dmitrievich Kavelin''' ({{lang-ru|Константи́н Дми́триевич Каве́лин}}) (November 4 1818 &amp;ndash; May 5 1885) was a [[Russia]]n historian, jurist, and [[sociologist]], sometimes called the chief architect of early Russian [[liberalism]].

Born in [[Saint Petersburg]] into an old noble family, Kavelin graduated from the legal department of the [[Moscow University]] and read law at the [[University of St Petersburg]] from 1839. Together with [[Timofey Granovsky]] and [[Alexander Herzen]], he was one of the leading ''[[Westernizer]]s''. In 1855, Herzen published Kavelin's celebrated proposal for the emancipation of serfs, which cost him the lucrative position of [[tsesarevich]]'s tutor. During the 1860s, Kavelin was elected President of the [[Free Economic Society]] and gradually drifted to the right. In his ''Short Review of Russian History'' (1887) he seconded many [[Slavophile]] opinions and praised the [[Sovereign state|state]] as the key institution of national history.

Some scholars believe that Kavelin was a [[prototype]] of Stiva Oblonski in [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[Anna Karenina]]''.

{{Politics of Macedonia}}

A referendum was held in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] on 30 September 2018, with voters asked whether they support [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]] membership by accepting [[Macedonia naming dispute#Prespa agreement|the agreement]] struck between the Republic of Macedonia and [[Greece]] in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/macedonia-sets-sept--30-as-date-for-referendum-on-name-deal-with-greece-10575168 |title=Macedonia sets Sept. 30 for referendum on name deal with Greece |website=www.channelnewsasia.com |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |language=en-US |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-sets-name-referendum-for-september-07-30-2018 |title=Macedonia Sets ‘Name’ Referendum for September |website=www.balkaninsight.com |publisher=Balkan Insight |language=en |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to [[Macedonia naming dispute|the 27-year long dispute]] between Republic of Macedonia and Greece over the former's name, an issue which has prevented the accession of Macedonia to the European Union and NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-greece-sing-historic-name-deal-06-17-2018 |title=Macedonia, Greece Sign 'Historic' Name Deal |website=www.balkaninsight.com |publisher=Balkan Insight |language=en |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government had carried out a social media campaign about the issue of the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-govt-kicks-off-name-referendum-campaign-07-02-2018 |title=Macedonia Govt Starts 'Name' Referendum Campaign |website=www.balkaninsight.com |publisher=Balkan Insight |language=en |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal ultimately failed on a constitutional ground because the turnout of eligible voters was not over 50 percent, according to the election commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-macedonia-referendum-turnout/macedonia-name-referendum-fails-to-reach-turnout-threshold-election-commission-idUSKCN1MA0X2 |title=Macedonia name referendum fails to reach turnout threshold: election commission |website=reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |language=en-UK |access-date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led the opposition to claim victory, while the government did as well by arguing that the result being non-binding meant the turnout requirement was pointless in the first place. Being non-binding, as well as including constitutional changes, its result will still need to be approved by two-thirds of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/23092018-no-disputing-macedonia-is-at-a-watershed-moment-analysis/ |title=No Disputing Macedonia Is At A Watershed Moment – Analysis |date=23 September 2018 |website=www.eurasiareview.com |publisher=Eurasia Review |language=en-US |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of Macedonia|Macedonian Prime Minister]] [[Zoran Zaev]] has vowed to push forward with the changes in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sekularac |first1=Ivana |title=Macedonia leader vows to press on with name change despite... |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-macedonia-referendum/macedonia-leader-vows-to-press-on-with-name-change-despite-referendum-failure-idUSKCN1M90U1?il=0 |accessdate=1 October 2018 |work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following [[SR Macedonia|Macedonia]]'s independence from [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in 1991, successive [[Greece|Greek]] governments have claimed that the country's name implied territorial claims on [[Greek Macedonia]] and have objected to the use of "Macedonia" by the new state. It was admitted to the [[United Nations]] in 1993 as "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" (FYROM),&lt;ref name="UNSC res. 817"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/doc/817|title=United Nations Security Council Resolution 817 |date=7 April 1993 |publisher=[[United Nations Security Council]] |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while most countries have [[List of countries' positions in the Macedonia naming dispute#Countries/entities using "Republic of Macedonia" for bilateral purposes|recognised the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name]].

Repeated attempts at negotiation for a composite name failed for 27 years. However, in 2018, high-level contacts between the governments of the two countries intensified, with the Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister [[Bujar Osmani]] visiting [[Athens]] for the name talks on 9 January,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/macedonia-greece-name-dispute-osmani-talks/28965566.html|title=Macedonian Deputy PM In Athens For Talks On Name Dispute |website=www.rferl.org |publisher=RFERL |accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Prime Minister of Macedonia|Macedonian Prime Minister]] [[Zoran Zaev]] meeting with his [[Prime Minister of Greece|Greek]] counterpart [[Alexis Tsipras]] on the sidelines of the [[World Economic Forum]] at [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]] on 24 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://neoskosmos.com/news/en/Greece-and-FYROM-PMs-to-meet-over-Macedonia-name-dispute|title=Greece and FYROM PMs to meet over ‘Macedonia’ name dispute|website=www.neoskosmos.com|publisher=Neos Kosmos|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/pms-to-meet-after-macedonia-name-dispute-rally-in-greece|title=PMs to meet after 'Macedonia' name dispute rally in Greece |website=www.sbs.com |publisher=SBS |accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nezavisen.mk/en/news/2018/01/18809/ |title=Tsipras and Zaev unblock Euro-integration process|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Davos meeting, the first of its kind in seven years, there appeared to be some resolution between the two leaders to end the naming dispute and to improve the [[Greece-Macedonia relations|relations between the two countries]]. Zaev subsequently agreed to take initiatives that would soothe Greek concerns over [[antiquisation]] policies, while Tsipras agreed to consent to [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]'s bid to join regional initiatives or agreements.

On 12 June 2018, Tsipras announced that he had reached an agreement with Zaev "which covers all the preconditions set by the Greek side".&lt;ref name="2018Deal"&gt;{{cite web |title=‘We have a deal,’ Greek PM says over FYROM name row |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/229552/article/ekathimerini/news/we-have-a-deal-greek-pm-says-over-fyrom-name-row |website=www.ekathimerini.com |publisher=Η Καθημερινή |accessdate=12 June 2018 |language=en |date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal would result in the Republic of Macedonia being renamed the Republic of North Macedonia ({{Lang-mk|Република Северна Македонија|translit=Republika Severna Makedonija}}), with the new name being used for all purposes.&lt;ref name="2018DealName"&gt;{{cite web |title=Greece ends 27-year Macedonia name row |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44401643 |website=www.bbc.com |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=12 June 2018 |date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaev announced that the deal includes recognition of the [[Macedonian language]] in the [[United Nations]] and that the [[citizenship]] of the country will be called, Macedonian/citizen of the Republic of North Macedonia. Also, there would be an explicit clarification that the citizens of the country are not related to the [[ancient Macedonians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Republic of North Macedonia with Macedonian language and identity, says Greek media |url=http://meta.mk/en/republic-of-north-macedonia-with-macedonian-language-and-identity-says-greek-media/ |website=www.eta.mk|publisher=Meta |accessdate=12 June 2018 |date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Κλείδωσε το «Βόρεια Μακεδονία» - Το διάγγελμα Τσίπρα για τη συμφωνία|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/969055/article/epikairothta/politikh/kleidwse-to-voreia-makedonia---to-diaggelma-tsipra-gia-th-symfwnia |trans-title=Agreed on «North Macedonia» {{endash}} Tsipras' speech to the nation about the deal |language=greek|website=kathimerini.gr |publisher=Kathimerini |accessdate=12 June 2018 |date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The agreement once and for always confirms and strengthens the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] ethnic and [[cultural identity]], the Macedonian language, the Macedonian [[nationality]].

Additionally, the agreement stipulates the removal of the [[Vergina Sun]] from public use in the Republic of Macedonia and the formation of a committee for the review of school textbooks and maps in both countries for the removal of irredentist content and to align them with [[UNESCO]] and [[Council of Europe]]'s standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crashonline.gr/epikairotita/1164670/chanetai-kai-o-ilios-tis-verginas-ti-orizei-i-symfonia-gia-to-sima/|title=Χάνεται και «ο Ηλιος της Βεργίνας»: Τι ορίζει η συμφωνία για το σήμα|trans-title=The «Sun of Vergina» is also being lost: what the agreement states|website=www.crashonline.gr|lang=el|publisher=Crash Online |date=14 June 2018|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was signed at [[Lake Prespa]], a body of water which is divided among Macedonia, Greece and [[Albania]].

[[Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia|Parliament]] paved the way for the referendum by ratifying the agreement for a second time in early July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rappler.com/world/regions/europe/206621-macedonia-parliament-ratify-greece-deal-referendum |title=Macedonia MPs ratify Greece deal, paving way for referendum |website=www.rappler.com |publisher=Rappler |language=en |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a month long delay by the opposition party [[VMRO-DPMNE]] to slow down the referendum preparation by not appointing members to the State Election Commission, the parliament finally agreed as of the end of July on a new composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-opposition-puts-name-referendum-at-risk-07-10-2018 |title=Macedonia Opposition Puts ‘Name’ Referendum at Risk |website=www.balkaninsight.com |publisher=Balkan Insight |language=en |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-unlocks-referendum-preparations-07-26-2018 |title=Macedonia Starts Work on Referendum Preparations |website=www.balkaninsight.com |publisher=Balkan Insight |language=en |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime Minister of Macedonia|Macedonian Prime Minister]] [[Zoran Zaev]] and the government coalition started an online campaign for a “Yes” vote in the referendum.

The main opposition party [[VMRO-DPMNE]] threatened to boycott the referendum and considered the deal with [[Greece]] to be an act of treason. In early September, the party's president [[Hristijan Mickoski]] came out with a statement encouraging citizens to vote as they feel it is right for their country's future, and that the party would respect different opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nezavisen.mk/en/news/2018/09/90095/ |title=Mickoski: The majority of VMRO-DPMNE supporters would either abstain or vote ‘against’ |website=www.nezavisen.mk |publisher=Nezavisen |language=en-EN |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party did not participate in the referendum campaign, while various high ranking party members voiced their support for the boycott or the “Yes” side. In early September, a cable from the [[United States Ambassador to Macedonia|US embassy in the Republic of Macedonia]] revealed by [[WikiLeaks]] showed that the 2008 VMRO-DPMNE government was willing to accept the name {{em|Republic of North Macedonia}}, for international and bilateral use only, provided it included the recognition of the [[Macedonian language]] and [[nationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08SKOPJE491_a.html |title=Macedonia/Greece: What the Macedonians Need to Resolve the Name Dispute |date=29 July 2008 |website=www.wikileaks.org |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]] |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/232251/article/ekathimerini/news/wikileaks-fyrom-would-have-accepted-north-macedonia-in-2008 |title=Wikileaks: FYROM would have accepted 'North Macedonia' in 2008 |website=www.ekathimerini.com |publisher=[[Kathimerini]] |language=en |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That proposal was rejected by Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://euobserver.com/tickers/142722 |title=Wikileaks: FYROM would have accepted new name in 2008 |website=www.euobserver.com |publisher=EU Observer |language=en |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The information has been denied by media close to  the party,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://kurir.mk/makedonija/vesti/kodzijas-za-vikiliks-dokumentot-gruevski-ne-prifati-ni-severna-ni-erga-omnes/ |title=Груевски не прифати ни „Северна“ ни „ерга омнес“ |website=www.kurir.mk |publisher=Kurir |language=mk |trans-title=Gruevski did not accept neither "north" nor "erga omnes" |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://bukefal.club/2018/09/03/vikiliks-severna-makedonija-bilo-prifatlivo-ushte-vo-2008-ma-no-edna-vazhna-razlika/ |title=Викиликс: „Северна Македонија“ било прифатливо уште во 2008-ма, но со една важна разлика - Bukefal |date=3 September 2018 |website=www.bukefal.club |publisher=Bukefal |language=en-US |trans-title=WikiLeaks: "North Macedonia" was acceptable in 2008, but with one important difference |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have stated that VMRO-DPMNE was only willing to accept changing the FYROM reference to North Macedonia, while keeping the constitutional name the same. On 23 September, [[President of Macedonia|Macedonia's President]] [[Gorge Ivanov]], who was elected as a candidate of the VMRO-DPMNE, decried the agreement and called on his compatriots to boycott the vote. Various other small [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] organizations{{which|date=October 2018}} with pro-[[Serbia]]n and pro-[[Russia]]n orientations have also organized protests against the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-macedonia-greece-name/more-than-1000-macedonians-protest-countrys-name-change-idUSKBN1JJ165 |title=More than 1,000 Macedonians protest country's name change |website=www.reuters.com |publisher=[[Reuters]] |language=en-US |access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian interference===
Various diplomats and analysts&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;, including [[United States Secretary of Defence|U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[Jim Mattis]],&lt;ref name="Polygraph"/&gt; have accused [[Russia]] of engaging in a campaign to undermine the referendum.

==Aftermath==
===International reactions===
[[Western world|Western]] leaders welcomed the result as positive, despite the low turnout. The [[European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy|European Union's Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations]],  [[Johannes Hahn]], called the “Yes” vote "very significant" and urged [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]'s political leaders to "respect this decision and take it forward with utmost responsibility". [[NATO]] chief, [[Jens Stoltenberg]], in his post on [[Twitter]] described the referendum as a "historic opportunity", while reaffirming that "NATO’s door is open" for Macedonia. The [[United States]] also welcomed the outcome, with the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] urging Macedonian lawmakers "to rise above partisan politics and seize this historic opportunity" in implementing the [[Macedonia naming dispute#Prespa agreement|Prespa agreement]], which could enable Macedonia to become "a full participant in Western institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/all/news/eu-and-nato-welcome-macedonias-referendum-result-despite-low-turnout/|title=EU and NATO hail Macedonia’s referendum result despite low turnout|website=EURACTIV.com with AFP and Reuters|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Greece's Foreign Ministry]] welcomed the positive result, but described it as "contradictory" to the low vote turnout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.gr/entry/elleniko-epoeryeio-exoterikon-antifatiko-to-apotelesma-toe-demopsefismatos-sten-pydm_gr_5bb11bcfe4b0343b3dc13c3c?ncid=other_topnaventr_coabgdcpxri&amp;utm_campaign=topnav|title=Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs: the outcome of the referendum in the Republic of Macedonia is contradictory (Original: Ελληνικό Υπουργείο Εξωτερικών: Αντιφατικό το αποτέλεσμα του δημοψηφίσματος στην πΓΔΜ)|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Prime Minister of Greece|Greek Prime Minister]] [[Alexis Tsipras]] phoned his [[Prime Minister of Macedonia|Macedonian]] counterpart [[Zoran Zaev]] right after the referendum to congratulate him for the positive outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amna.gr/en/article/297067/Tsipras-congratulates-Zaev-on-determination-to-implement-the-agreement|title=Tsipras congratulates Zaev on determination to implement the agreement|website=ANMA|date=1 October 2018|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russia]], a staunch opponent of Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic integration, on the other hand, hinted that it could veto the Prespa agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece, by bringing it to the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. Macedonia dismissed [[Moscow]]'s threats by stating that bilateral agreements can not be dependent on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/233223/article/ekathimerini/news/name-deal-in-the-balance-as-russia-hints-at-un-veto|title=Name deal in the balance as Russia hints at UN veto|website=Kathimerini|date=2 October 2018|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-dismisses-russian-threat-on-name-agreement-10-03-2018|title=Macedonia Dismisses Russian 'Threat' to Name Deal|website=BalkanInsight|date=4 October 2018|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macedonia===
On 19 October 2018, [[Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia’s Parliament]] voted to start the process of renaming the country Republic of North Macedonia. A total of 80 deputies in the 120-seat parliament voted in favour of the renaming proposal—just reaching the two-thirds majority needed to enact constitutional changes, a quorum only needing to be met, and no more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/20/welcome-to-north-macedonia-parliament-votes-for-name-change|title=Welcome to North Macedonia: parliament votes for name change|website=The Guardian|date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7914">'''Memorialization''' generally refers to the process of preserving memories of people or events. It can be a form of address or petition, or a ceremony of remembrance or commemoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
 | title =Memorialization
 | encyclopedia =[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]
 | edition =Online
 | url =http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/memorialization
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | Memorialisation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorialization as a Human Right==
Memorialization is a universal need for both those being memorialized and those who are grieving. Although historically it was limited to the elite and only practiced in the highest societal classes, it is now almost considered a fundamental [[human right]] for all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memorialized.com/ |title=Memorialized |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2002 |website=Memorialized.com |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorialization and Transitional Justice==
In the context of [[transitional justice]], memorialization is used to honor the victims of  human rights abuses.   Memorials can help governments reconcile tensions with victims by demonstrating respect and acknowledging the past. They can also help to establish a record of history, and to  prevent the recurrence of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ictj.org/our-work/transitional-justice-issues/truth-and-memory |title=Truth and Memory |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ) |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorials can also be serious social and political forces in democracy-building efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |first1=Sebastian |last1=Brett |first2=Louis |last2=Bickford |first3=Liz |last3=Ševčenko |first4=Marcela |last4=Rios |date=2007  |title=Memorialization and Democracy: State Policy and Civic Action |url=http://ictj.org/publication/memorialization-and-democracy-state-policy-and-civic-action |publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) |format=PDF |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorials are also a form of [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]], or compensation efforts that seek to address past [[human rights violations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Memorials in Times of Transition|last = Buckley-Zistel, S. / Schäfer, S. (eds.)|first = |publisher = Intersentia|year = 2014|isbn = 9781780682112|location = Antwerp|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They aim to provide compensation for losses endured by victims of abuse, and remedy prior wrongdoing. They also publicly recognize that victims are entitled to redress and respect. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation  recognizes “commemorations and tributes to the victims” as a form of reparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous  types of memorials used as [[transitional justice]] initiatives. These include architectural memorials, museums, and other commemorative events.  For instance, in northern [[Uganda]], monuments, annual prayer ceremonies, and a mass grave were created in response to the war conducted by and against the [[Lord’s Resistance Army]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

 | publisher  =International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) 
 | format     =PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Museum of Memory and Human Rights]] in [[Chile]], which was created to document abuses by the former [[military dictatorship]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museodelamemoria.cl/el-museo/sobre-el-museo/ |title=Sobre el Museo |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=20 April 2012 |website=Museo de la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos |language=Spanish |access-date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges of Memorialization==
Memorialization can arouse controversy and present certain risks. In unstable political situations, memorials may increase desire for revenge and catalyze further violence. They are highly politicized processes that represent the will of those in power. They are thus difficult to shape, and international relief workers, [[Peacekeeping|peacekeepers]], and [[NGOs]] risk being drawn into disputes about the creation or maintenance of memorial sites. Yet they also have the potential to redress historical grievances and enable societies to progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3235">The '''Ministry of Justice''' is a ministry of the [[government of Niue]].

Per the Niue Constitution Act of 1974, the Minister of Justice provided advice to the Governor-General regarding the selection of Judges of the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mbarral.webs.ull.es/NiueConstitutionAct1974.html|title=Niue - Legislation - Niue Constitution Act 1974|website=mbarral.webs.ull.es|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, the ministry went by the name Ministry of Justice, Lands and Survey. Based on the government's website in 2018, the justice affairs appear to have merged with the Ministry of Social Services—as there is no separate section for the Ministry of Justice. As of 2018, records show Darren Tohovaka as the Acting Secretary of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.nu/wb/pages/ministries.php|title=Government of Niue - Ministries|website=www.gov.nu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|Supply bill|bills on government spending|Appropriation bill|the Irish controversy of 1753–1756|Money Bill dispute}}
In the [[Westminster system]] (and, colloquially, in the [[United States]]), a '''money bill''' or '''supply bill ''' is a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] that solely concerns [[taxation]] or [[government spending]] (also known as [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]] of money), as opposed to changes in public law.

== Conventions ==
It is often a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the [[upper house]] may not block a money bill. There is often another requirement that non-money bill-type clauses may not be attached to a money bill. The rationale behind this convention is that the upper house, being appointed or indirectly elected, should not have any right to decide on taxation and public expenditure-related policies as may be framed by the directly elected representatives of the lower house. Therefore, money bills are an exception to the general rule that for a bill to be enacted into a law, it has to be approved by both Houses of the Parliament—the lower house and the upper house.&lt;ref&gt;Datta, Pratik; Malhotra, Shefali; Tyagi, Shivangi. [http://www.nipfp.org.in/media/medialibrary/2017/03/WP_2017_192.pdf "Judicial Review and Money Bills"]. National Institute of Public Finance and Policy Working Paper No. 192. Retrieved 24 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loss of supply]] in the [[lower house]] is conventionally considered to be an expression of the house's [[motion of no confidence|loss of confidence]] in the government resulting in the government's fall.

== Requirements in Westminster systems ==

=== Australia ===
A supply bill in the Australian System is required to pass the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and be signed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. The Senate has no power or ability to introduce or modify a supply bill, but has the ability to block or defer the passing of a supply bill. The most famous instance where supply was blocked was during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]]. This has resulted in agreements between political parties to prevent the blockage of supply bills through the Senate.

=== Bangladesh ===
A money bill is specifically defined by Article 81 of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]]. The [[President of Bangladesh]] can send back all bills passed by the [[Jatiyo Sangshad|Parliament]] for a review except a money bill. However, a money bill can be introduced to the [[Jatiyo Sangshad|Parliament]] only at the President's recommendation. Additionally, tax can only be levied by the Parliament.&lt;ref name=bd&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of Bangladesh|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/research/bangladesh-constitution.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
Procedure for a Money Bill:

#Money Bills can be introduced only in [[Lok Sabha]] (the directly elected 'people's house' of the Indian Parliament). 
#Money bills passed by the Lok Sabha are sent to the [[Rajya Sabha]] (the upper house of parliament, elected by the state and territorial legislatures or appointed by the [[President of India|president]]). The Rajya Sabha may not amend money bills but can recommend amendments. To make sure that Rajya Sabha doesn't amend the bill by adding some non-money matters (known as Financial Bill), the [[Speaker of the Lok Sabha]] certifies the bill as a money bill before sending it to the upper house, and the decision of the Speaker is binding on both the Houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rulep10.html |title=Rules of the Lok Sabha |publisher=Parliamentofindia.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A money bill must be returned to the Lok Sabha within 14 days, or the bill is deemed to have passed both houses in the form it was originally passed by the Lok Sabha.
#When a Money Bill is returned to the Lok Sabha with the recommended amendments of the Rajya Sabha, it is open to the Lok Sabha to accept or reject any or all of the recommendations.
#A money bill is deemed to have passed both houses with any recommended amendments the Lok Sabha chooses to accept, and without any that it chooses to decline.
# The definition of "Money Bill" is given in Article 110 of [[The Constitution of India]]. A financial bill is not a Money Bill unless it fulfills the requirements of Article 110. 
#The Speaker of the Lok Sabha certifies if a financial bill is a Money Bill or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Datta|first1=Pratik|last2=Malhotra|first2=Shefali|last3=Tyagi|first3=Shivangi|title=Judicial Review and Money Bills|url=http://www.nipfp.org.in/media/medialibrary/2017/03/WP_2017_192.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Public Finance and Policy|accessdate=24 March 2017|ref=Judicial Review and Money Bills}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Policy cut motion - disapproval of the given policy. Symbolically, the members demand that the amount of the demand be reduced to 1&amp;nbsp;INR. They may also suggest an alternative policy.
#Economy cut motion - it is demanded that the amount of the policy be reduced by a specified amount.
#Token cut motion - used to show specific grievance against the government. Also states that the amount of the demand be reduced by Rs. 100.
#A money bill can only be introduced in parliament with prior permission of the [[President of India]].  
#Finance bill is supposed to be enacted within 75 days (including the Parliament voting and the President assenting).
#Money bill cannot be returned by the President to the parliament for its reconsideration, as it is presented in the Lok Sabha with his permission.

The concept of money bills in India came to the forefront during the enactment of the Aadhar Act, 2016. In spite of resistance by the opposition, the Aadhaar Bill was certified as a ‘money bill’ by the Speaker of the Lower House. The Upper House proposed certain amendments, but ultimately the [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]]-dominated Lower House rejected the amendments suggested by the Upper House and unilaterally enacted the Aadhar Act, 2016. Immediately thereafter, [[Jairam Ramesh]], a senior [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] leader, challenged the speaker’s decision to treat the Aadhar Bill as a ‘money bill’ before the Supreme Court of India. Article 110(3) of the Constitution of India categorically states that 'if any question arises whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, the decision of the Speaker of the House of the People thereon shall be final'. Therefore, one of the prime constitutional questions before the Supreme Court is whether it can review the speaker’s certificate classifying a bill as a ‘money bill’. In three prior cases, the [[Supreme Court of India]] has refused to review the Speaker's certificate. However, some commentators have argued that the Court's earlier judgements were incorrect and Article 110(3) made the Speaker’s decision "final" for the purpose of the two Houses of the Parliament, not for the Supreme Court of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Datta|first1=Pratik|last2=Malhotra|first2=Shefali|last3=Tyagi|first3=Shivangi|title=Judicial Review and Money Bills|url=http://www.nipfp.org.in/media/medialibrary/2017/03/WP_2017_192.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Public Finance and Policy|accessdate=24 March 2017|ref=Judicial Review and Money Bills}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is further supported by the fact that in [https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1686885/ Kihoto Hollohan vs Zachillhu (AIR 1993 SC 412)], the "final" decision of the speaker regarding disqualification of members of the House under the Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution was held to be a judicial decision subject to judicial review. This suggests that the "final" status given by the Indian constitution does not automatically immune the Indian speaker's decision or certificate from judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Datta|first1=Pratik|last2=Malhotra|first2=Shefali|last3=Tyagi|first3=Shivangi|title=Judicial Review and Money Bills|url=http://www.nipfp.org.in/media/medialibrary/2017/03/WP_2017_192.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Public Finance and Policy|accessdate=24 March 2017|ref=Judicial Review and Money Bills}}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of this crucial constitutional question, it has been suggested that the Supreme Court in ''Jairam Ramesh v. Union of India'' should create a constitution bench of at least nine judges to settle the law on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arun|first1=T.K.|title=The Money Bill conundrum: Constitution bench should decide|url=http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/cursor/the-money-bill-conundrum-constitution-bench-should-decide/|publisher=The Economic Times|accessdate=6 April 2017|ref=The Money Bill conundrum}}&lt;/ref&gt;The five judge bench in the ratio 4-1 decided that the Aadhar Bill was a Money Bill

=== Republic of Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Seanad Éireann|Senate]] may not delay a money bill ({{Lang-ga|bille airgid}})&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/a-misc/legi.htm&lt;/ref&gt; more than 21 days. The [[President of Ireland]] may not refuse to sign a money bill and may not refer such a bill to the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] to test its [[constitutionality]]. Procedures exist for resolution of disputes as to whether a Bill is a money bill. Since the 1922 constitution (as amended by the [[Constitution (Amendment No. 12) Act 1930]]) and under the 1937 constitution, such disputes can be resolved by a committee on privileges.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], section 1(1) of the [[Parliament Act 1911]] provides that the [[House of Lords]] may not delay a money bill more than a month. It is at the discretion of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] to certify which bills are money bills, and his decision is final and is not subject to challenge. Section 1(2) of the Act states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A Money Bill means a [[Public Bill]] which in the opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the [[Consolidated Fund]], the [[National Loans Fund]] or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof; or subordinate matters incidental to those subjects or any of them. In this subsection the expressions "taxation," "public money," and "loan" respectively do not include any taxation, money, or loan raised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/13/section/1 |title=Parliament Act 1911 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Parliament Act 1911 was the product of the political crisis of 1909. The People's Budget of 1909 proposed by the House of Commons was rejected by the House of Lords. A government whose budget (that is the Finance Bill) is rejected can only resign or dissolve Parliament, because without money it is impossible to govern. The rejection of the Finance Bill in 1909 by the Lords prompted the then British government to initiate steps to curtail the powers of the House of Lords in this regard. This is evident from the Preamble of the 1911 Act which states: "An Act to make provision with respect to the powers of the House of Lords in relation to those of the House of Commons ...".&lt;ref&gt;Datta, Pratik; Malhotra, Shefali; Tyagi, Shivangi. [http://www.nipfp.org.in/media/medialibrary/2017/03/WP_2017_192.pdf "Judicial Review and Money Bills"]. National Institute of Public Finance and Policy Working Paper No. 192. Retrieved 24 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference to the National Loans Fund was inserted on 1 April 1968&lt;ref&gt;The National Loans Act 1968, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/13/section/24 section 24(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/13/section/1 section 1(5)] of the [[National Loans Act 1968]].

For this purpose, the expression "Public Bill" does not include any Bill for confirming a [[Provisional Order]].

Bradley and Ewing said that the statutory definition of Money Bill is "strictly interpreted".&lt;ref&gt;A W Bradley and K D Ewing, Constitutional and Administrative Law, Twelfth Edition, Longman, 1997, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Most annual [[Finance Act|Finance Bills]] have not been certified to be Money Bills.&lt;ref&gt;A W Bradley and K D Ewing, Constitutional and Administrative Law, Twelfth Edition, Longman, 1997, pp. 213 and 214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erskine May, Parliamentary Practice, 21st Edition, 1989, pp. 751–753 (editor C Gorden)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, I. Parliament, Second Edition, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

== Requirements in non-Westminster systems ==

=== United States ===
While the [[United States of America]] is not a parliamentary democracy, the [[Origination Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution requires that all bills raising revenue originate in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], consistent with British constitutional practice; by convention, [[appropriation bill]]s (bills that ''spend'' money) also originate in the House. Unlike in most Westminster systems, there are no limits on the [[United States Senate|Senate's]] ability to amend revenue bills or any requirement for the Senate to approve such bills within a certain timeframe. Both appropriations and revenue bills are often referred to as money bills to contrast them with [[authorization bill]]s. The U.S. Supreme Court in [[United States v. Munoz-Flores|United States v. Munoz-Flores (1990)]] held that: "A law passed in violation of the Origination Clause would thus be no more immune from judicial scrutiny because it was passed by both Houses and signed by the President than would be a law passed in violation of the First Amendment".&lt;ref&gt;Datta, Pratik; Malhotra, Shefali; Tyagi, Shivangi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8101">'''New Source Performance Standards''' ('''NSPS''') are pollution control [[Technical standard|standards]] issued by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).  The term is used in the [[Clean Air Act (1970)|Clean Air Act Extension of 1970]] (CAA) to refer to [[air pollution]] emission standards, and in the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) referring to standards for [[water pollution]] discharges of [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] to [[surface water]]s.

== Introduction ==
Some pollution control laws are organized with varying degrees of stringency. The different standards may be based on several factors, including whether the pollution source is an existing facility at the time the standard is published, or is constructed after publication. The standards for new sources may be more stringent than that for existing facilities, on the principle that a new plant can be designed with the latest and most advanced control technologies.&lt;ref name=carruth&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carruth |first1=Russellyn S. |last2=Goldstein |first2=Bernard D. |date=2013 |title=Environmental Health Law: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXhjAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT82 |chapter=Defining New Sources |publisher=John Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=9781118420874}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82-83}}

== Clean Air Act ==
The Clean Air Act NSPS dictate the level of pollution that a new [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stationary source]] may produce. These standards are authorized by Section 111 of the CAA&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Air Act, section 111, {{USC|42|7411}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the regulations are published in [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations|40 CFR]] Part 60.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). "Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; NSPS have been established for a number of individual industrial or source categories. Examples:
* Air emissions from chemical manufacturing wastewater&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nsps/socww/socwwpg.html |title=Rule and Implementation Information for Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources–Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry Wastewater |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-02-23 |website=Air Toxics |publisher=EPA}} 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart YYY.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Boilers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nsps/boilernsps/boilernsps.html |title=Rule and Implementation Information for New Source Performance Standards for Boilers (Steam Generating Units) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-02-23 |website=Air Toxics |publisher=EPA}} 40 CFR Part 60, Subparts D-Dc.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Landfills&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/atw/landfill/landflpg.html |title=Rule and Implementation Information for Standards of Performance for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-02-23 |website=Air Toxics |publisher=EPA}} 40 CFR Part 60, Subparts Cc and WWW.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Petroleum refineries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nsps/petrefnsps/petrefnspspg.html |title=Rule Information for Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources–Petroleum Refineries |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-02-23 |website=Air Toxics |publisher=EPA}} 40 CFR Part 60, Subparts J &amp; Ja.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stationary gas turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nsps/turbine/turbnsps.html |title=Rule and Implementation Information–New Source Performance Standards for Stationary Gas Turbines |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-02-23 |website=Air Toxics |publisher=EPA}} 40 CFR part 60, Subpart GG.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic process for establishing standards===
#Identify type of emitting facility.
#For each type of facility, identify the type of pollutant control technology that is appropriate.
#From a study of all the plants and all the information available about the plants and their technologies, establish an allowed concentration of the [[criteria pollutants]] that is the upper limit of what can be emitted.&lt;ref name=carruth /&gt;{{rp|84-85}}

== Clean Water Act ==
Under the Clean Water Act, NSPS set the level of allowable wastewater discharges from new industrial facilities. EPA issues NSPS for categories of industrial dischargers, typically in conjunction with the issuance of [[effluent guidelines]] for existing sources. In developing NSPS, the CWA requires that EPA determine the "best available demonstrated control technology" (BADCT) for the particular industrial category. BADCT may be more stringent than the [[best available technology|best available technology economically achievable]] standard used for existing dischargers. This consideration may include setting a "no discharge of pollutants standard" (also called a "zero discharge" standard) if practicable.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Clean Water Act, section 306(a), {{USCSub|33|1316|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/learn-about-effluent-guidelines |title=Learn About Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSPS regulations are published at [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations|40 CFR]] Subchapter N (Parts 405-499). NSPS issued by EPA include the following categories:
* Coal Mining&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Coal Mining Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|434}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dairy Products&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Dairy Products Processing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|405}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing (including a zero discharge requirement for several subcategories)&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|415}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Iron and Steel Manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Iron and Steel Manufacturing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oil and Gas Extraction&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|435}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Petroleum Refining&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Petroleum Refining Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|419}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pulp, Paper and Paperboard&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Pulp, Paper and Paperboard Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|430}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sugar Processing (including a zero discharge requirement for one subcategory)&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Sugar Processing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|409}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Textile Mills.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Textile Mills Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. {{USCFR|40|410}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA has published a general definition of "new source" in the federal wastewater permit regulations.&lt;ref&gt;
"EPA Administered Permit Programs: The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|122.2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More specialized definitions of "new source" are included in some of the individual category regulations, e.g., the definition for the Pulp, Paper and Paperboard category.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Pulp, Paper and Paperboard Point Source Category. ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|430.01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District''''' (also known as '''''Newdow v. Carey'''''), Nos. 05-17257,  05-17344, and 06-15093, was a [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] decision that upheld the constitutionality of the teacher-led recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance by students in public schools. The 2–1 majority found that the recitation did not constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the United States Constitution.

It was an appeal from the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of California|Eastern District of California]], which ruled that the recitation of the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] in public school is unconstitutional based on the Ninth Circuit's ruling that the words "under God" violate the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] in ''[[Newdow v. United States Congress]]'' in 2002. That case was later appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] and overturned on an issue of [[Standing (law)|standing]] in ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'' in 2004.

In the new case, the plaintiffs were three unnamed families.  The defendants were [[Twin Rivers Unified School District|Rio Linda Union School District]], the United States as a Defendant-Intervenor and a group of defendant-intervenors, including lead intervenor John Carey, who sought to preserve the current wording of the Pledge.  The private defendant-intervenors were represented by the [[Becket Fund for Religious Liberty]].  The Court of Appeals consolidated the defendants' three different appeals for briefing and argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restorethepledge.com/live/litigation/pledge/docs/2006-02-24%20%20Order%20granting%20Motion%20to%20Consolidate%20Appeals%20.pdf  Court of Appeals' Initial Time Schedule Order]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court heard [[oral argument]] in the case on December 4, 2007 where the petitioner [[Michael Newdow]] argued for plaintiffs. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gregory Katsas argued for the United States, Terence Cassidy argued for the Rio Linda Union School District, and [[Kevin Hasson]] of the Becket Fund argued for the private intervenor-defendants. A decision was handed down on March 11, 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4165">'''Opinion evidence''' refers to evidence of what the witness thinks, believes, or infers in regard to facts, as distinguished from personal knowledge of the facts themselves.&lt;ref name="freedict"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Opinion+Evidence|title=Opinion Evidence|work=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[common law jurisdiction]]s the general rule is that a witness is supposed to testify as to what was observed and not to give an opinion on what was observed. However, there are two exceptions to this rule: [[expert evidence]] and non-expert opinion given by laymen which people in their daily lives reach without conscious [[ratiocination]].

== General rule ==
In general, witnesses should testify only as to the facts observed and should not give opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cross &amp; Tapper on Evidence (10th edn) |last=Tapper |first=Colin |year=2004 |publisher=Lexis Nexis |location=UK |isbn=978-0-406-95004-8 |page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main rationale for such a rule is that the admission of opinion evidence would not assist, or might even mislead, the court and in particular the jury. This is because opinion evidence is usually irrelevant. Moreover, admission of such evidence would usurp the functions of the jury, which alone should be the tribunal of fact and draw its own inferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cross &amp; Tapper on Evidence (10th edn) |last=Tapper |first=Colin |year=2004 |publisher=Lexis Nexis |location=UK |isbn=978-0-406-95004-8 |page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expert evidence ==
{{Main|Expert evidence}}
An expert witness is a [[witness]], who by virtue of [[education]], [[training]], [[skill]], or [[experience]], is believed to have [[expert]]ise and specialised [[knowledge]] in a particular subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially and legally rely upon the witness's specialized ([[Scientific evidence (law)|scientific]], technical or other) opinion about an [[evidence]] or [[fact]] issue within the scope of his expertise, referred to as the expert opinion, as an assistance to the [[fact-finder]].&lt;ref&gt;Federal Rule of Evidence 702 (As amended April 17, 2000, effective December 1, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Expert witnesses may also deliver expert evidence about facts from the domain of their expertise.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', articles "Evidence", "Expert", "Witness"&lt;/ref&gt; The facts upon which an expert opinion is based must be proved by admissible evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Turner [1975] QB 834&lt;/ref&gt; The duty of experts is to furnish the judge with the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of their conclusions, so that the judge or jury can form their own independent judgment by the application of these criteria to the facts proved.&lt;ref&gt;Davie v Edinburgh Magistrates&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-expert opinion ==
Non-expert opinion refers to the opinion given in restricted circumstances by laymen or persons who do not possess any expertise. These circumstances mainly concern matters of everyday life where a person may be expected to give opinions and which opinions may be safely acted upon by others.

Such circumstances cannot be definitively laid out in a closed list of cases. However, cases in which non-expert opinion has been admitted include:
* Apparent age of a person&lt;ref&gt;R v Cox [1898] 1 QB 179&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apparent age of objects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inbrief.co.uk/expert-evidence.htm|title=Expert evidence|work=In Brief|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Peru]] on 25 August 1919.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=pe011919 Peru, 25 August 1919: Constitutional reform] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed reforms were approved by voters.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

==Background==
On 7 April 1919 President-elect [[Augusto B. Leguía]] launched a [[Self-coup|presidential coup]]. On 10 July he issued two decrees, one calling [[Peruvian parliamentary election, 1919|Congressional elections]] for 24 August and one for a referendum on constitutional reform on the following day. The newly elected Congress would be able to discuss and supplement the constitution, but would be bound by the referendum result.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

==Amendments==
The new constitution had 19 chapters. It provided for a presidential term of five years, with the President elected by Congress. Congress would be elected in whole every five years, whilst there would also be three Provincial Assemblies. It also provided for six years of free and compulsory primary education, limited the [[death penalty]] to cases of murder and treason, and ensured that [[martial law]] could not curtail personal freedoms.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

==Aftermath==
After being approved by voters, the constitution was adopted by Congress on 27 December 1919 by a vote of 79 to 0.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2011}}
'''Reserve Requirements for Depository Institutions''' ({{USCFR|12|204}}, '''Regulation D''') is a [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Federal Reserve]] regulation which sets out [[Reserve requirement|reserve requirements]] for [[Banking in the United States|banks in the United States]]. It is more familiar to the public as the regulation that limits monthly withdrawals from savings accounts.

==Reserve requirement==
The regulation requires depository institutions to keep cash reserves in order to meet immediate withdrawals against their transaction accounts. The minimum reserve requirement is 3% of the total amount over $16 million, and an additional 7% of the amount over $122.3 million. The institution may satisfy the requirement with [[bank vault|vault]] cash and with deposits at a [[Federal Reserve Bank]], or a bank that acts as a Federal Reserve [[correspondent account|correspondent]]. [[Bankers' bank]]s and [[corporate credit union]]s, which act only as correspondents for other institutions, are not subject to the reserve requirements. The [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]] may require additional reserves after consulting Congress or [[deposit insurance]] authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|12|204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six-transaction limit==
In consumer banking, "Regulation D" often refers to §204.2(d)(2) of the regulation, which limits withdrawals or outgoing transfers from a [[Savings account|savings]] or [[Money market account|money market]] account. No more than six such transactions per [[bank statement|statement]] period may be made from an account by various "convenient" methods, which include [[cheque|checks]], [[debit card]] payments, and automatic transactions such as [[automated clearing house]] transfers or [[electronic bill payment]]. Institutions must warn any customer that exceeds the limit and must freeze, close or reclassify accounts that do so repeatedly. The regulation does not limit transactions made in person, at an [[automated teller machine|ATM]], by mail, or by telephone request for a mailed check. Even in these cases, the institution may require seven-day advance written notice before releasing funds. This right is not normally exercised, but it must be part of the account agreement.&lt;ref&gt;''Savings Deposits'', in [http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/cch/int_depos.pdf Regulation D - Reserve requirements], Federal Reserve,&lt;/ref&gt;

Each institution sets its own specific policies for responding to violations of the limit. [[Discover Financial|Discover Bank]], for example, will close a savings account if Regulation D is exceeded 3 or more times in a 12-month period. [[Wells Fargo]] charges a $15 "Excess Activity Fee" for each item cleared after the regulation has been exceeded, and converts the account to a checking account if the activity persists.&lt;ref&gt;Wells Fargo, "[https://www.wellsfargo.com/help/checking-savings/glossary/ Savings &amp; Checking Account Definitions: Excess Activity]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation was amended in 2009 to allow greater freedom for the depositor: beforehand, the limit was six withdrawals per month if the funds remained within the same institution (e.g., transfer to checking), but was only three drafts where the funds left the institution (e.g., check, [[ACH Network]], or card based purchase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-12431.htm|title=Federal Register, Volume 74 Issue 102 (Friday, May 29, 2009)|website=edocket.access.gpo.gov|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rocky Rococo Pizza and Pasta''' is a chain of North American restaurants that specializes in pan-style pizza sold [[Pizza by the slice|by the slice]]. It was founded in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in 1974 by a pair of college students who took the name from a character invented in 1969 by [[the Firesign Theatre]]. The Firesign Theatre claimed ownership of the name and threatened legal action in 1985, but according to legal precedent set by a similar case in Austin, Texas, they had weakened their case for [[copyright infringement]] in a 1975 visit to the first Rocky Rococo store, when they gave the owners autographed pictures, which implied their approval of the name use. The chain grew as large as 120 stores in 1986, and the owners sold the franchise rights to another partner and group of investors in 1988. Today there are still 40 locations in the Midwest.

== History ==
Wayne Mosley and Roger Brown opened their first store in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], in 1974. 
The name "Rocky [[Rococo]]" was invented in 1969 by [[the Firesign Theatre]] for a villain in the "Further Adventures of [[Nick Danger]]" sketch on their second [[comedy album]], ''[[How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All]]''. The character was based on [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s Joel Cairo as portrayed by [[Peter Lorre]] in the 1941 film ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. The name is a parody of a character invented by [[the Beatles]] for their song ''[[Rocky Raccoon]]''. The Firesign character is described as a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] and depicted as bald and wearing a [[fez]]. The company's web site does not mention either the Firesign Theatre or the Beatles character as inspiration for the name.

To design their restaurant's logo, Mosley and Brown hired a Madison artist to sketch a character based on the [[Spy vs. Spy|White Spy]] character from [[Mad Magazine]], and hired comic actor Jim Pederson&lt;!-- Do not wikilink; this is NOT the politician!--&gt; to portray their "Rocky Rococo" mascot as a moustachioed Italian wearing a white suit, wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses. Pederson died at age 68 on February 4, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shultz|first1=Rob|title=Jim Pederson, the face and personality of Rocky Rococo Pizza for decades, dies|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/jim-pederson-the-face-and-personality-of-rocky-rococo-pizza/article_cda897af-2f3c-51d2-935d-85371fab969a.html|accessdate=November 3, 2017|work=Wisconsin State Journal|agency=Madison.com|date=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright infringement==
The Firesign Theatre visited the first Rocky Rococo Pizza when on tour in Madison in 1975, and reacted with good humor, joking around with the owners and giving them pictures that said, "To Rocky, from Rocky" which were hung on the wall. But in 1985, when the chain had grown to 62 restaurants, the Firesign Theatre sent the owners a letter claiming ownership of the name. Their lawyers found a similar case where an Austin, Texas pizzeria named Conan's ran afoul of the copyright owners, producers of the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. Since the creator of the [[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|''Conan the Barbarian'' comic]] had similarly endorsed the restaurant by drawing Conan on its walls, the suit lost in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]]. So the Firesigns settled out of court.&lt;ref name="IB_news"&gt;{{cite news |last=Breuer |first=Tom |date=March 2014 |title=Rocky Rococo celebrates 40-year slice of success |url=http://www.ibmadison.com/In-Business-Madison/March-2014/Rocky-Rococo-celebrates-40-year-slice-of-success/index.php?cparticle=2&amp;siarticle=1#artanc |work=In Business Madison |location=Madison, Wisconsin |access-date=February 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1986, the chain had grown to 120 stores, according to the company.&lt;ref name="Mosley_obit"/&gt; Mosley and Brown sold the franchise rights to Tom Hester and a group of investors in 1988. Mosley died at his home in Madison on November 28, 2017, aged 70.&lt;ref name="Mosley_obit"&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Rocky Rococo pizza co-founder dies at 70|url=http://www.channel3000.com/news/rocky-rococo-pizza-co-founder-dies-at-70/664156326|work=WISC-TV Channel3000.com |location=Madison, Wisconsin |date=November 29, 2017 |accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district has more than 3,000 full-time employees serving approximately 30,000 students in 41 schools from downtown San José in the north to the Almaden Valley in the south.

==Mission and Vision==
San José Unified's vision is "preparing today’s students to be the thinkers, leaders, and creators of tomorrow." The district's mission is to "elevate opportunities for all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.sjusd.org/who-we-are/our-story/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
San Jose City School District was founded in 1853 and renamed San Jose Unified School District in 1936. In the late 1990s, a fire sprinkler broke in the basement of the district office, destroying many of the district's historic documents. District staff and local historians have been working ever since to rebuild the district archive.

Over 164 years, San José Unified has supported 17 elementary schools, of which 38 remain active as of the 2017-2018 school year. Additionally, the district supports six comprehensive middle schools, six comprehensive high schools, a continuation high school, and an alternative education school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.sjusd.org/our-schools/schools/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A state law passed in the 1950s required certain elementary districts to either build their own high school or be annexed by a district that already had a high school. Thus, in 1956, the voters in Almaden Union School District elected to merge with San José Unified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=San Jose Mercury News|date=January 18, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1983 Federal Bankruptcy Judge [[Seymour Abrahams]] declared the school board bankrupt under Chapter 9. The judge rolled back employee wages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/30/us/san-jose-schools-can-cut-pay-us-bankruptcy-court-rules.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26540">The '''San Quentin Six''' were six [[inmate]]s at [[San Quentin State Prison]] in the U.S. state of [[California]] (Hugo Pinell, Willie Tate, Johnny Larry Spain, David Johnson, Fleeta Drumgo and Luis Talamantez), who were accused of participating in an August 21, 1971 [[Prison escape|escape]] attempt that left six people dead, including [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]], a co-founder of the [[Black Guerrilla Family]].

Costing more than $2 million, their 16-month [[trial]] was the longest in the state's history at the time and was dubbed "The Longest Trial" by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine.&lt;ref name="The Day-January 7, 1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=Last vestiges of radical movement will go on trial in Bingham case|first=Lary |last=Hatfield|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RDlSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RzYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4907%2C1089678|newspaper=The Day|publisher=The Day Publishing Company|location=New London, Connecticut|date=January 7, 1985|pages=1, 4|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Longest Trial|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914334,00.html?promoid=googlep|newspaper=TIME|date=July 19, 1976|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the six defendants, one was [[Conviction|convicted]] of [[murder]], two were convicted of [[assault]] on [[correctional officer]]s, and three were [[Acquittal|acquitted]] of all charges.

During the escape, which sparked a [[riot]] on the cellblock, Jackson had a .32 caliber pistol allegedly smuggled into the prison by attorney [[Stephen Bingham]]. Immediately after the incident, Bingham went on the run and fled the country for 13 years; he returned in 1984 to stand trial, and was acquitted of all charges in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People In The News: Ex-fugitive finally feels free, retains his political activism|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=auhVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eOEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6900%2C6635723|newspaper=The Register-Guard|location=Eugene, Oregon|date=June 28, 1987|page=2A|accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham's defense had argued that guards had smuggled George Jackson the gun, hoping that he would be killed. During the ensuing riot, George Jackson, three corrections officers, and two inmates were killed.

In addition to Jackson, those killed in the altercation were guards Paul E. Krasenes, 52, Frank DeLeon, 44, and Jere P. Graham, 39, as well as inmates John Lynn, 29, and Ronald L. Kane, 28.&lt;ref name="The Journal-August 13, 1976"&gt;{{cite news|title=San Quentin Six trial costs California over $2 million |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dQhdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JVoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1406%2C1463515|agency=AP|newspaper=The Journal|location=Meriden, Connecticut|date=August 13, 1976|page=16|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain was found guilty in the shooting deaths of guards DeLeon and Graham, Pinell was convicted of cutting the throats of guards Charles Breckenridge and Urbano Rubiaco, Jr. (died 2013), both of whom survived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/marinij/obituary.aspx?n=urbano-benito-rubiaco-rubi&amp;pid=162191445&amp;fhid=3061|title=Urbano Benito "Rubi" Rubiaco Jr.'s Obituary on Marin Independent Journal|website=Marin Independent Journal|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Johnson was convicted of assaulting Breckenridge.&lt;ref name="The Journal-August 13, 1976"/&gt; There were no convictions for the killings of Krasenes, Lynn, or Kane.&lt;ref name="The Journal-August 13, 1976"/&gt; Drumgo, Talamantaz, and Tate were found not guilty of all charges, including various counts of murder, conspiracy, and assault.&lt;ref name="The Journal-August 13, 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mEIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Profile], books.google.com; accessed August 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==August 21, 1971==
Prison officials stated that attorney Stephen Bingham and a female assistant arrived at San Quentin for a meeting with George Jackson at around 2:00 pm.&lt;ref name=Findley&gt;{{cite news|last=Findley|first=Tim|title=The Quentin Violence -- First Inside Account|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 24, 1971|location=San Francisco|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoemans&gt;{{cite news|last=Yoemans|first=Jeannine|title=San Quentin Story Unfolded; Officials Give Account of Escape Attempt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vItLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KiQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7056%2C5471921|accessdate=March 18, 2013|newspaper=The Press-Courier|date=August 24, 1971|agency=AP|location=Oxnard, California|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assistant handed a briefcase to Bingham when she was not permitted to enter the visiting room.&lt;ref name=Findley/&gt;

According to an [[Associated Press]] report based on interviews with prison officials, a cursory search of Bingham's briefcase was performed and a guard failed to open a tape recorder case that was in it.&lt;ref name=Yoemans/&gt; This report stated that the briefcase was returned to Bingham after he walked through a metal detector.&lt;ref name=Yoemans/&gt; An article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' based on the reports of officials provided a slightly different version by stating that Bingham had triggered the metal detector while carrying the briefcase through it.&lt;ref name=Findley/&gt; That report indicated that an officer opened the briefcase and found a [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] [[tape recorder]], then inspected its [[battery holder|battery compartment]] to determine whether it was functional.&lt;ref name=Findley/&gt; Prison officials later came to believe that the working components of the recorder had been removed to allow room for an automatic handgun with its grip handles removed.&lt;ref name=Findley/&gt; Initial reports described the weapon as a [[9 mm caliber|9 mm pistol]] made by the Spanish manufacturer [[Llama firearms]].&lt;ref name=Yoemans/&gt;

Jackson was [[strip search]]ed in San Quentin's Adjustment Center, then escorted to the visiting room.&lt;ref name=Findley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoemans/&gt; He sat across from Bingham at a wooden table that had no barriers between the two and was intermittently observed by guards.&lt;ref name=Yoemans/&gt; Officials speculated that during this time Bingham passed the gun to Jackson, who concealed it in his hair under a [[Knit cap|watch cap]].&lt;ref name=Findley/&gt; The meeting lasted about 15 minutes.&lt;ref name=Yoemans/&gt; Around 2:35 pm, Jackson was escorted by officer Frank DeLeon back to the Adjustment Center, where another officer performed a second search prior to returning Jackson to his cell.&lt;ref name=Findley/&gt; When that officer asked Jackson about what appeared to be a pencil in his hair, Jackson pulled the gun out, pointed it at the officers, and inserted a magazine. He reportedly shouted, "This is it!",&lt;ref name=Findley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoemans/&gt; and ordered all of the officers to lie face down on the floor. Jackson then ordered an officer to get up and activate a switch that opened all 34 cells on the first floor.&lt;ref name=Yoemans/&gt;

According to the ''Chronicle'', officer Charles Breckenridge's throat was slashed and he was dragged to Jackson's cell; Breckenridge survived.&lt;ref name=Findley/&gt; On top of him were thrown the bodies of officers Frank DeLeon and Paul Krasenes, as well as those of two white inmates (John Lynn and Ronald L. Kane). Sergeant Jere Graham was killed by inmates when he came to the Adjustment Center to pick up DeLeon for another assignment. An alarm was eventually sounded and Jackson and Johnny Spain ran from the Adjustment Center. Initial reports indicated that at approximately 2:55 pm, Jackson was shot once in the foot and once in the top of the head as he attempted to flee.&lt;ref name=Findley/&gt;

==Trial==
During the trial, Tate was freed on $50,000 bail.&lt;ref name=Stack&gt;{{cite news|last=Stack|first=Peter|title=Verdict on the San Quentin Six – Three Guilty, Three Cleared|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 13, 1976|location=San Francisco|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defense attorneys presented a conspiracy theory suggesting that prison and law enforcement officials set up Jackson to be killed.&lt;ref name=Stack/&gt; The prosecution asserted that the escape attempt was a conspiracy that involved radicals sympathetic to Jackson.&lt;ref name=Stack/&gt;

After deliberating for 24 days, the Marin County jury of five men and seven women rendered their verdicts for 46 separate felony counts on August 12, 1976.&lt;ref name=Stack/&gt; Marin County Superior Court Judge Henry J. Broderick spent 45 minutes reading the verdicts.&lt;ref name=Stack/&gt; The trial ended as the longest in California history, during which 23,000 pages of testimony were collected.&lt;ref name=Stack/&gt;

==The San Quentin Six==
===Fleeta Drumgo===
'''Fleeta Drumgo''' (1945 – November 26, 1979) was born to Inez Williams in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="Davis Jordan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis Jordan|first=Fania|date=March 1974|title=THE SAN QUENTIN SIX: A CASE OF VENGEANCE|journal=The Black Scholar|volume=5|issue=6|pages=44–50|publisher=Paradigm Publishers|jstor=41065690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/S%20Disk/Soledad%20Brothers/Item%2011.pdf Fleeta Drumgo profile], jfk.hood.edu; accessed August 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4856">In law a '''settlor''' is a person who [[Settlement (trust)|settles]] property on [[trust law]] for the benefit of beneficiaries. In some legal systems, a settlor is also referred to as a '''trustor''', or occasionally, a '''grantor''' or '''donor'''.&lt;ref&gt;In common law legal systems outside of the United States, a donor usually refers to someone who grants a power other than a trust.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the trust is a [[testamentary trust]], the settlor is usually referred to as the '''[[testator]]'''. The settlor may also be the [[trustee]] of the trust (where he declares that he holds his own property on trusts) or a third party may be the trustee (where he transfers the property to the trustee on trusts). In British [[common law]] it has been held, controversially, that where a trustee declares an intention to transfer trust property to a trust of which he is one of several trustees, that is a valid settlement notwithstanding the property is not vested in the other trustees.&lt;ref&gt;''[[T Choithram International SA v Pagarani|T Choithram International SA and others v Pagarani and others]]'' [2001] 2 All ER 492&lt;/ref&gt;

Capacity to be a trustee is generally co-extensive with the ability to hold and dispose of a legal or beneficial interest in property. In practice, special considerations arise only with respect to minors and mentally incapacitated persons.

A settlor may create a trust by manifesting an intention to create it. In most countries no formalities are required to create an ''inter vivos'' trust over personal property, but there are often formalities associated with trusts over [[real property]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom, evidence in writing is required to create a trust in land, see section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925; although a failure to comply with the section renders the trust [[unenforceable]] and not [[void (law)|void]], see ''Gardner v Rowe'' (1828) 5 Russ 258&lt;/ref&gt; or [[will (law)|testamentary trusts]].&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, as amended by section 17 of the Administration of Justice Act 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The words or acts of the settlor must be sufficient to establish an intention that either another person or the settlor himself shall be trustee of the property the beneficiary;&lt;ref&gt;edit needed for: trustee of the property the beneficiary&lt;/ref&gt; a general intention to benefit another person on its own is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Paul v Constance'' [1977] 1 WLR 521&lt;/ref&gt; These formalities apply to [[express trusts]] only, and not to resulting, implied or [[constructive trust]]s.

For a settlor to validly create a trust, in most common law legal systems they must satisfy the three certainties, established in [[Knight v Knight]]:

#''certainty of intention'' - whether the settlor (or testator) has manifested an intention to create a trust.

#''certainty of subject matter'' - whether the property identified as being settled is sufficiently accurately identified.&lt;ref&gt;Trust which have been held to fail include trusts over "the bulk of my estate" (''Palmer v Simmonds'' (1854) 2 Drew 221), "such parts of my ... estate as she shall not have sold" (''Re Jones'' [1898] 1 Ch 438), "anything that is left" (''In the Estate of Last'' [1958] P 137) and "all my other houses" [meaning after prior legatees had chosen which houses they wished] (''Boyce v Boyce'' (1849) 16 Sim 476).  But these cases should be contrasted with those where the subject-matter of the gift is determined by the discretion of the trustees, for example, in ''Re Golay's Will Trusts'' [1965] 1 WLR 969, where a direction to allow a beneficiary to "enjoy one of my flats during her lifetime and to receive a reasonable income from my other properties" was upheld as the trustees could select and decide the matters. ''[[Certum est quod certum reddi potest]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

#''certainty of objects'' - the [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiaries]] must be clearly ascertainable within the [[perpetuity period]].&lt;ref&gt;"It is clear law that a trust (other than a [[charitable trust]]) must be for ascertainable beneficiaries", per [[Lord Denning]] in ''Re Vandervell's Trusts (No 2)'' [1974] Ch 269 at 319&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a settlement of property on a third party trustee by a settlor fails, the property is usually said to be held on [[resulting trust]]s for the settlor. However, if a settlor validly transfers property to a third party, and the words used are held not to create a trust, the usual rule is that the donee take the property absolutely.&lt;ref&gt;''Lassence v Tierney'' (1849) 1 Mac &amp; Cr 551&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Slivenko v. Latvia''''' (48321/99) was a case argued before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] and decided in 2003.

==Facts==

Ms. T. Slivenko was born in Estonia in 1959 and at the age of one month she moved to Latvia together with her parents. Her husband, N. Slivenko, born in 1952, was transferred to Latvia in 1977 to serve as a Soviet military officer. He met T. Slivenko in Latvia and married her there in 1980. In 1981, T. Slivenko gave birth to their daughter K. Slivenko.

After Latvia regained independence, the already retired N. Slivenko was ordered to leave the country as a former Soviet/Russian officer by the Citizenship and Migration Authority, referring to the Russian-Latvian treaty of 1994. K. and T. Slivenko were ordered to leave Latvia, too, as members of N. Slivenko's family. T. Slivenko contested this decision, referring to the facts that she was a daughter of permanent residents of Latvia and she didn't come to Latvia as wife of N. Slivenko.

After unsuccessful court proceedings, all three Slivenkos left Latvia, leaving there the parents of T. Slivenko. They contested their deportation before [[ECtHR]]. Third-party comments were received from the Russian Government, having exercised its right to intervene. In 2001, the Second Section of ECtHR has relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber. In 2002, the Grand Chamber dismissed claims by N. Slivenko as inadmissible, but declared admissible the application of T. Slivenko and K. Slivenko concerning Articles 5, 8 and 14.

==Judgment==

In the court' s evaluation, a scheme for withdrawal of foreign troops and their families based on a general finding that their removal was necessary for national security was not as such incompatible with Article 8, but implementation of such a scheme without any possibility of taking into account individual circumstances was. T. and K. Slivenkos were integrated into Latvian society at the time and could not be regarded as endangering national security because they were part of T. Slivenko's father’s family, who had retired in 1986, had remained in Latvia and was not himself considered to present any such danger.

The court therefore has found a violation of the Article 8 of [[ECHR]] in respect of K. Slivenko and T. Slivenko and no need to deal separately with the complaints under Article 14, by 11 votes against 6. The court has concluded besides, that there was no violation of Article 5, by 16 votes against 1. 

Judges Wildhaber, Ress, Bratza, Cabral Barreto, Greve and Maruste have filed dissenting opinions, considering that Article 8 wasn't violated. Judge Kovler has filed an opinion dissenting in part, considering that Article 5 was violated, too, and concurring in part concerning Article 8.

In the [[law of the United States]], a '''special master''' is generally a subordinate official appointed by a [[judge]] to make sure that [[Court order|judicial orders]] are actually followed, or in the alternative, to hear evidence on behalf of the judge and make recommendations to the judge as to the disposition of a matter.  The special master should not be confused with the traditional [[common law]] concept of a [[Master_(judiciary)|master]], a judge of the High Court entrusted to deal with summary and administrative matters falling short of a full trial.

In the [[federal judiciary of the United States]], a special master is an adjunct to a federal court. Rule 53 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] allows a federal court to appoint a master, with the consent of the parties, to conduct proceedings and report to the Court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule53.htm Text of Rule 53]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
The role of the special master, who is frequently but not necessarily an [[lawyer|attorney]], is to supervise those falling under the order of the court to ensure that the court order is being followed and to report on the activities of the entity being supervised in a timely matter to the judge or the judge's designated representatives. Special masters have been controversial in some cases, and they are often cited by critics as an example of judicial supremacy over the other branches of government.  For example, they have at times ordered the expenditure of funds over and above the amount appropriated by a legislative body for the remediation of the situation being examined. Their powers have generally been found to be valid and their remedies upheld by US courts.

The [[US Supreme Court]] will normally assign [[original jurisdiction]] disputes (cases such as disputes between states that are first heard at the Supreme Court level) to a special master to conduct what amounts to a trial court (the taking of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] and a ruling). The Supreme Court can then assess the master's ruling much as a normal appeals court would, rather than conduct the trial itself. That is necessary as trials in the US almost always involve live testimony, and it would be too unwieldy for nine justices to rule on evidentiary objections in real time.

In [[federal judiciary of the United States|United States Federal Courts]], a special master is appointed under Rule 53&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 53|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_53|publisher=Cornell|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]. Rule 53 allows for a special master to be appointed only if one of the following exists: (1) the parties consent to the appointment, (2) hold trial without a jury or make recommended findings of fact where there is some exceptional condition or accounting or difficult computation of damages, or (3) address pre-trial or post-trial matters that cannot be effectively and timely addressed by a judge or magistrate judge.

==Examples==
The usage of special masters in matters involving complex electronic discovery (or "eDiscovery") has been promulgated by the Academy of Court Appointed Masters (ACAM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courtappointedmasters.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] operates an Office of Special Masters to resolve claims under the [[National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act]], which is popularly known as the [[vaccine court]].

Cases involving special masters often involve situations in which it has been shown that governmental entities are violating [[civil rights]]. High-profile cases in recent years in which special masters have been used include some in which [[U.S. state|states]] have been ordered to upgrade their [[prison]] facilities, which were held to violate the [[US Constitution]], which bars [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and certain state [[mental hospital]]s, which have been found so substandard as to violate the rights of their inmates.  Summaries of cases involving special masters are published at ''Cohen's Special Master Case Reporter''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.SpecialMaster.law&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]] in the United States, then-Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] appointed [[Kenneth Feinberg]] as special master to oversee the dispensation of an [[September 11th Victim Compensation Fund|$11 billion victim's compensation fund]].

The [[Anthony Levandowski#Lawsuit|Waymo v. Uber]] lawsuit saw Judge [[William Haskell Alsup]] appoint a special master to determine whether Uber violated [[discovery (law)|discovery]] rules in not disclosing the "Richard Jacobs Letter".&lt;ref&gt;Case 3:17-cv-00939-WHA Document 2396. "Report of the special master regarding the Jacobs materials".[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4329986-document-21877596.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Statute of Frauds''' (29 Car 2 c 3) (1677) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]]. It required that certain types of [[contract]]s, [[will (law)|will]]s, and  grants, assignment or surrender of leases or interest in [[real property]] must be in writing and [[Signature|signed]] to avoid [[fraud]] on the court by [[perjury]] and subornation of perjury. It also required that documents of the courts be signed and dated.

The attested date for the enactment of the Statute of Frauds is 16 April 1677 ([[New Style]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cosgigan Jr., George P.|year= 1913|title=The Date and Authorship of Statute of Frauds  |journal= [[Harvard Law Review]] |volume= 26|issue= |pages=329 at 334 |publisher= |doi= 10.2307/1326318|pmid= |pmc= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act is believed to have been primarily drafted by [[Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Nottingham]] assisted by Sir [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], Sir [[Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford|Francis North]] and Sir [[Leoline Jenkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cosgigan Jr., George P.|year= 1913|title=The Date and Authorship of Statute of Frauds  |journal= [[Harvard Law Review]] |volume= 26|issue= |pages=329 at 334–42 |publisher= |doi= 10.2307/1326318|pmid= |pmc= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Statute of Frauds was originally enacted, the sections of, and the clauses of section 4 of, that Act were not numbered. They were numbered when the Act was republished in the [[Statutes at Large]]. The Statute at Large, Cambridge Edition published in 1770 divided the Act into 25 sections. The section on the sale of goods was section 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Danby |editor1-last= Pickering|editor1-link=Danby Pickering |others= |title=The Statutes at Large, from Magna Chart to the End of the Eleventh Parliament of Great Britain, Anno 1761|url= |type= |edition=  |series= |volume= 3|date= |year= 1770 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Cambridge University |location=  |pages= 385–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Statutes of the Realm]] published in 1818, the Statute of Frauds was divided into 24 sections. The section on the sale of goods became section 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last= Raithby|editor1-link=John Raithby |others= |title=The Statutes of the Realm |url=  http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=47463|type= |edition=  |series= |volume= 5|date= |year= 1819 |month= |origyear= |publisher= |location=  |pages= 839–842}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article uses the same numbering system as the Statutes of the Realm.

== Real property ==

Section 1 provides that all [[Leasehold estate|leases]], estates, and interest in [[freehold (law)|freehold]] or term of years created by [[Livery of seisin|livery and seisin]] or parole not in writing signed by the maker shall have the effect as an estate of lease at will.

Section 2 excepts from section 1 all leases not exceeding three years in term where rent equals two thirds of the value of the improved land.

Section 3 provides that all [[leasehold estate|leases]], estates, and interest in [[freehold (law)|freehold]] or term of years assigned granted or surrendered must be by [[deed]] or note in writing signed by the grantor or his agent or by [[operation of law]].

Section 7 provides that all conveyances in trusts of land must be in writing signed by the  maker or by will.

Section 9 provides that all grants and assignments of trusts in land must be in writing signed by the grantor or by will.

Section 8 excepts from section 7 and 9 trusts that arise or result by implication of construction of law i.e. [[resulting trust]]s and [[constructive trust]]s.

Sections 1 to 3 and 7 to 9 and 24 were repealed by section 207 of, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/schedule/SEVENTH/enacted Schedule 7] to, the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] (15 Geo 5 c 20). However section 53(1)(a) required that interest in land be created or disposed by a signed writing, a will or operation of law. Section 53(1)(b) requires a declaration of trust in land must be by a signed writing or a will and section 53(1)(c) requires the same disposition of equitable interests and existing trusts.  Section 52(2) state that section 53 does not affect the creation or operation of implied, resulting or constructive trusts. Section 54 provides interests in land created by parol and not put in writing and signed have the force and effect of interests at will only except that the lease for 3 years or less at the best rent may be made by parol.

== Section 4 ==
Section 4 of the Statute of Frauds provided that an action may not be brought on the following types of contracts unless there is a written note or memorandum signed by the party being charged or a person authorized by them: 
# Contracts by the [[executor]] of a will to pay a [[debt]] of the [[estate (law)|estate]] with his own money.
# Contracts in which one party becomes a [[surety]] (acts as guarantor) for another party's debt or other obligation. 
# Contracts in consideration of [[marriage]].
# Contracts for the transfer of an interest in [[real estate|land]].
# Contracts that cannot be performed within one [[year]].

[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Cha2/29/3/section/IV This section] now provides that contracts of guarantee (surety for another's debt) are unenforceable unless evidenced in writing. This requirement is subject to [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/19-20/97/section/3 section 3] of the [[Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856]] (19 &amp; 20 Vict c 97) which provides that the consideration for the guarantee need not appear in writing or by necessary inference from a written document.

[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo4/9/14/section/6 Section 6] of the [[Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828]] (9 Geo 4 c 14) &lt;ref&gt;This [[short title]] was given by the [[Short Titles Act 1896]]&lt;/ref&gt; (commonly known as '''Lord Tenterden's Act'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Clerk and Lindsell on Torts]], 16th Edition, 1989, Sweet and Maxwell, paragraph 18-41, at page 1036&lt;/ref&gt;) was enacted to prevent clause 2 section 4 being circumvented by bringing an action for the [[tort of deceit]] (the tort in Freeman v. Palsey&lt;ref&gt;(1789) 3[[Term Reports|TR]] 51&lt;/ref&gt;).

In this section, the words "or upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments or any interest in or concerning them" were repealed by section 207 of, and Schedule 7 to, the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] (15 Geo 5 c 20). However the requirement that contract for sale of land must be in writing was continued by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/40/enacted section 40] of that Act. Section 40 of the Law of Property Act 1925 was repealed by sections 2(8) and 4 of, and Schedule 2 to, the [[Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989]], however section 2 of that Act requires that contracts for the sale of land be signed and in writing.

All the clauses except the one relating to surety contracts were repealed by section 1 of [[Law Reform (Enforcement of Contracts) Act 1954]] (2 &amp; 3 Eliz 2 c 34).

This section does not apply (if it would otherwise do so) in relation to a financial collateral arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003]] (SI 2003/3226), [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/3226/regulation/4/made regulation 4(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the [[Law Revision Committee]] recommended that this section be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Command paper|Cmd]] 5449&lt;/ref&gt;

== Court procedure==

Sections 10 and 11 deal with the execution of [[Judgment (law)|judgments]] upon [[equitable interest]]s of [[cestui que trust|''cestui que'' trust]] in land and  held free from the [[incumbrance]]s of the persons seized in trust. Trust shall be pass by descent to the heir of the cestui que trust subject to charges for the oblation of the decedent, but the heir shall not  become chargeable of his own estate for the obligations of the decedent.

Section 13&lt;ref&gt;This section was divided into two sections in ''[[Statutes at Large]]'': section 13 for the whereas clause and section 14 for the enactment clause.&lt;/ref&gt; and 14 provide that the effective date for [[Judgment (law)|judgments]] against [[bona fide purchaser|''bona fide'' purchasers for value]] of land is the date they are [[docket (court)|docket]]ed and requiring that judgments of the courts enter the date docketed when signing it without a fee.

Section 15 provides that ''[[fieri facias]]'' or other [[writ of execution|writs of execution]] are effective against goods from the date given it is given to the [[sheriff]] and the sheriff shall write on the back of it the day, month and year he received it without a fee.
 
Section 17 provides that [[recognisance]]s shall bind ''bona fide'' purchasers for value of land from the time they are enrolled and requiring that the day month and year of the recognisance be entered on the roll without a fee.

Section 23 preserves the [[jurisdiction]] of [[ecclesiastical courts]] to [[probate]] wills in personal property subject to the rules of this statute. [[Court of Probate Act 1857]] (20 &amp; 21 Vict c 77) transferred responsibility for the granting of [[probate]] from the [[ecclesiastical court]]s of [[England and Wales]] to a new civil [[Court of Probate]] in January 1858.

Section 24 proves that the husband may be the [[administrator (law)|administrator]] of the [[intestate]] estate of a married woman as before the [[Statute of Distribution]] (22 &amp; 23 Car 2 c 10).

Sections 13 and 14 were repealed by Part I of the Schedule to the [[Civil Procedure Acts Repeal Act 1879]] (42 &amp; 43 Vict. c 59).

Sections 15 was repealed by the Schedule to the [[Sale of Goods Act 1893]], but section 26 that act continued the requiment that  ''fieri facias'' or other writ of execution are effective against goods from when they are given to the sheriff and the sheriff  shall endorce the writ with the date and time he received  it.

Section 17 was repealed by the Schedule to the [[Statute Law Revision and Civil Procedure Act 1881]] (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. 59).

Sections 10 and 11 and 23 and 24, so far as unrepealed, were repealed by section 56 of, and Part I of [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/23/schedule/SECOND/enacted Schedule 2] to the [[Administration of Estates Act 1925]] (15 &amp; 16 Geo 5 c 23). Section 24 was also repealed by section 207 of, and Schedule 7 to, the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] (15 Geo 5 c 20).

== Section 16 Sales of Goods ==

Section 16 proved no contract for the sale of [[Personal property|goods]] for the price of ten [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] or more shall be good except if the buyer shall accept part of the goods and actually receive the same or give some thing in earnest to bind the bargain or in part of payment, or that some note or memorandum in writing of the said contract signed by the parties to be charged by such contract or their authorized agents.  This section was amended by section 7 of the '''Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828''' (9 Geo. 4 [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo4/9/14/contents/enacted ch 14]) to cover goods to be delivered in the future,  not yet manufactured, or not yet fit for delivery.

Sections 16 was repealed by the Schedule to the [[Sale of Goods Act 1893]] (56 &amp; 57 Vict c 71). However its terms were substantially re-enacted as section 4 of the '''Sales of Goods Act 1893'''.
Section 4 of the Sales of Goods Act 1893 was repealed by the Law Reform (Enforcement of Contracts) Act 1954.

==Wills==

Section 5 requires that wills devising land be in writing signed by the person devising the property or some other person at his direction,and shall be attested and subscribed in the presence of the said [[testator]] by three or four [[credible witness]]es.

Section 6 provides that a gift of land in a will may only be revoked by another will or a [[codicil (will)|codicil]] or other writing declaring the revocation executed in the same manner as a will is by section 5 or by testator or someone at his direction and in his presence burned, cancelled, torn or obliterated.

Section 1 of the [[Wills Act 1751]] (25 Geo 2 c 6) provides that any gift in a will to person witnessing a will is void to the extent his testimony and he is a valid witness to the execution of the will under the '''Statute of Frauds'''. Section 2 provides if there gift is a charge on land to pay debts to the witness then the charge stands and the witness is admitted.

Section 12 provides that an estate ''[[pur autre vie]]'' may devised by will in writing signed by the testator or someone in his presence and at his express direction, attested and subscribed in the testators presence by three of more witnesses. It also provides for estate ''pur autre vie'' in cases where no devise is made.

Sections 18 through 20 provide rules for nuncupative (oral) wills for personal estates valued at over 30 pounds  may be only made during the last illness of a testator. After six months have passed from the speaking of the will no [[testimony]] shall be received to prove a nuncupative will unless the testimony of the substance of it was committed to writing within six days of making the will. A nuncuparative will must be witnessed by three witnesses.

Section 16 of the [[Administration of Justice Act 1705]] (4 &amp; 5 Ann c 3) provided that any witness who could testify in court could witness a nuncuparative will.

Section 21 provides that a written will in personal property may not be repealed or altered orally except if it is put in writing during the life of the testator and read to him and allowed by him and proven by at least three witnesses.

Section 22 allows [[soldier]]s in actual [[military service]] and [[sailor|seamen]] [[at sea]] to dispose of their personal property as they might have done before the passage of this Act.

So much of this Act as related to devises or bequests of lands or tenements, or to the revocation or alteration of any devise in writing of any lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any clause thereof, or to the devise of any estate pur autre vie, or to any such estate being assets, or to nuncupative wills, or to the repeal, altering or changing of any will in writing concerning any goods or chattels or personal estate, or any clause, devise, or bequest therein was repealed by section 2 of the [[Wills Act 1837]] (1 Vict [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Will4and1Vict/7/26/contents c 26]). The marginal note to that section said that the effect of this was to repeal sections 5 and 6 and 12 and 19 to 22.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1837/26/pdfs/ukpga_18370026_en.pdf The Wills Act 1837]&lt;/ref&gt; [[UK Statute Law Database|Legislation.gov.uk]] has this as sections 18 to 21 instead of 19 to 22.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Cha2/29/3/section/XVIIIXXI Legislation.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 22 was repealed by Part VII of the Schedule to the [[Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969]] (c 52). However section 11 of the Wills Act 1837 continues the right of Soldiers and Seamen to dispose of their personal estate as they had previously.

The '''Supreme Court of Ontario''' was a [[superior court]] of the Canadian province of [[Ontario]]. Created in 1881 pursuant to the Ontario Judicature Act (1881), the Supreme Court of Ontario had two branches: the High Court of Justice Division and the Appellate Division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/about/pubs/cjr/firstreport/history.asp History of the Ontario Courts - Chapter 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court of Ontario was a Section 96 court with inherent jurisdiction.

The Appellate Division was later transformed into the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]]. 

In 1989 the Courts of Justice Amendment Act, 1989 was enacted by the Government to create one large superior trial court for Ontario. This Act came into force in 1990 and resulted in the merger of the Supreme Court (or High Court), the District Court and the Surrogate Court into the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division).

The Ontario Court (General Division) was later replaced by the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]].

The court once sat at 145 Queen Street West in Toronto, now site of [[Four Seasons Centre]].

[[File:Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and the United States 29 July 1858.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and the United States, or "Harris Treaty", 29 July 1858. [[Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)]].]]

The {{Nihongo|'''Treaty of Amity and Commerce'''|日米修好通商条約|Nichibei Shūkō Tsūshō Jōyaku}}, also called the '''Harris Treaty''', between the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] was signed on the deck of the {{USS|Powhatan|1850|6}} in Edo (now Tokyo) Bay on July 29, 1858. It opened the ports of Kanagawa and four other Japanese cities to trade and granted [[extraterritoriality]] to foreigners, among a number of trading stipulations.

==The Treaty==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--reference only exists for middle section/list--&gt;
[[File:Kurofune 3.jpg|thumb|[[USS Powhatan (1850)]]]]
[[File:Treaties of Amity and Commerce between Japan and Holland England France Russia and the United States 1858.jpg|thumb|right|Texts of the Treaties of Amity and Commerce between Japan and the Netherlands, England, France, Russia and the United States, 1858]]

The treaty followed the 1854 [[Convention of Kanagawa]], which granted coaling rights for [[US]] ships and allowed for a US Consul in [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]]. Although [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Matthew Perry]] secured fuel for US ships and protection for US sailors, he left the important matter of trading rights to [[Townsend Harris]], another US envoy who negotiated with the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]; the treaty is therefore often referred to as the "Harris Treaty". It took two years to break down Japanese resistance, but with the threat of looming British demands for similar privileges, the Tokugawa government eventually capitulated.

Among the most important points were:&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Harris, Townsend |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* exchange of diplomatic agent
* in addition to the existing ports of [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]] and [[Hakodate]], the ports of [[Kanagawa]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] to be open to foreign trade effective 4 July 1859 and thereafter [[Niigata, Niigata|Niigata]], and [[Hyōgo]] opened on 1 January 1860 and 1 January 1863 respectively 
* in all the treaty ports listed, United States citizens may permanently reside, have the right to lease ground and purchase the buildings thereon, and may erect dwellings and warehouses
* a system of [[extraterritoriality]] that provided for the subjugation of foreign residents to the laws of their own consular courts instead of the Japanese law system
* fixed low import-export duties, subject to international control
* right of freedom of religious expression and church construction to serve the needs of United States nationals within the confines of the designated [[foreign settlement (Japan)|foreign settlements]] at the [[treaty ports]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=zhu|first1=Chen Jie|title=Mingzhi wei xin : gai bian Riben de 50 nian|date=2011|publisher=Shanxi ren min chu ban she|location=Xi'an|isbn=9787224095791|edition=Di 1 ban.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement served as a model for similar treaties signed by Japan with other foreign countries in the ensuing weeks. These [[Unequal Treaties]] curtailed Japanese sovereignty for the first time in its history; more importantly, it revealed Japan's growing weakness, and was seen by the West as a pretext for possible colonisation of Japan. The recovery of national status and strength became an overarching priority for the Japanese, with the treaty's domestic consequences being the end of [[Bakufu]] (Shogun) control and the establishment of a new imperial government.

==American interests in Japan==

Perry's expedition to Japan is theoretically linked to the notion of [[manifest destiny]], in which Americans had a "God-given" right to spread their political institutions and commerce across North America.&lt;ref&gt;LaFeber, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Japan in particular was that of a base of commerce between China and the United States. According to US Secretary of State [[Daniel Webster]], God had placed coal for steam ships and other trading vessels "in the depths of the Japanese islands for the benefit of the human family."&lt;ref&gt;LaFeber, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of "Manifest Destiny" as an imperialistic measure outside of North America was not introduced as a significant idea until the Republican bid for office in 1892, thereby suggesting, in practicality, a mere economic interest in Japan, as it held coal reserves in key locations for Pacific trade.

==Extension of the "Perry Crisis"==
[[File:TownsendHarris1855JamesBogle.jpg|thumb|Townsend Harris negotiated the "Treaty of Amity and Commerce" (painted in 1855 by [[James Bogle (painter)|James Bogle]]).]]
The [[Convention of Kanagawa]] mediated by Commodore Perry was a primary step to a rather forced extension of American influence in Japan. However, most problems that the Tokugawa Shogunate faced came from a division within the country between those who favored opening to the West immediately (''kaikoku'') and advocates of ''joi'' ("expel the barbarian") who favored a preservation of Japanese culture and influence until Japan could face the military threat posed by the West.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, "From Sakoku to Kaikoku", p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Most Japanese were familiar with the subjugation of Chinese trade by the British after the [[First Opium War|Opium War of 1840]], but they were divided on how and when they would inevitably open their ports. Both camps did agree that trade should be handled by Japanese going overseas instead of foreigners coming into Japan and violating the country's seclusion laws. Many of those Tokugawan officials who agreed to the [[Treaty of Kanagawa]] did so in an effort to avoid war with the United States or Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Miyauchi, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a deepening domestic crisis; after 1858, the Shogunate was trapped between the demands of the West and its powerful domestic enemies.

However, [[Townsend Harris]]' terms were much more demanding than Perry's. Harris claimed that the laws of Japan were "very peculiar" and it would be unfair for foreigners to live under such rule.&lt;ref&gt;McMaster, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; Article III of the treaty gave Americans the right to trade and reside in Yedo (Tokyo) and Osaka without influence from the Japanese government; the treaty also allowed for consular jurisdiction in those cities opened to American trade, the free export of Japanese gold and silver, and a conventional tariff. The entrance of foreigners to the port of [[Edo]], the shogunal capital, and the placement of an official from a foreign government in proximity to the Emperor was threatening, even to those who supported opening to the West publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, "From Sakoku to Kaikoku", p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; These demands in particular demonstrated the United States' planned role for Japan; there was to be freedom of trade, allowance for an influx of Americans, (but no expectations of Japanese coming to the United States), no interest in military concerns, and religious toleration of Japanese tradition. It was merely a link in a chain of commerce that would connect North America to China.

Harris' emphasis (and threat) of the inevitable defeat of the resisting Japanese by the British and the French was enough to convince many of the ''kaikoku'' members of the Tokugawa Shogunate to agree to the terms of the United States, no matter how unfavorable they were. The memory of China's overwhelming defeat was too close to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Miyauchi, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional Treaties==
[[File:1860 Japanese Delegation to US.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The 1860 Japanese mission to the U.S., photographed by [[Mathew Brady]].]]
After reluctantly accepting the Harris Treaty, Japan quickly signed similar treaties, called the [[Ansei Treaties]], with [[Russia]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], and the [[Netherlands]]. This process was hastened by the outcome of the [[Arrow War]] in 1858 in which the Chinese were once again soundly defeated by the British and the French. Harris also suggested that Japan sign "honorable treaties" before the allied Anglo-French fleet would sail to Japan and coerce the signing of "unequal treaties". However, the content of those treaties did not differ in their most essential points from the [[Tientsin Treaty]] between Great Britain and China in 1858; one of the most prominent of the [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] in the history of Eastern-Western foreign relations.&lt;ref&gt;Murase, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratification==

{{Wikisource|Harris Treaty}}
The Treaty was ratified through the visit of the first [[Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860)|Japanese Embassy to the United States]] in 1860.  The new relationship with the United States has been cited as a factor in the assassination of [[Ii Naosuke]].&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

==Effects==
According to a 2017 study, the treaties reducing trade barriers between Japan and Western powers caused GDP to increase in Japan by 7 percent in the immediate period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://microeconomicinsights.org/gains-trade-evidence-nineteenth-century-japan/|title=Gains from trade: evidence from nineteenth century Japan {{!}} Microeconomic Insights|date=2017-08-31|work=Microeconomic Insights|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24517">The '''United Kingdom Mines and quarries regulation in 1910''' was a specialised topic in [[UK labour law]], given the complexity of the legislation and seriousness of injuries that people suffered.

==Coal mines==
The mode of progress to be recorded in the regulation of coal mines since 1872 can be contrasted in one aspect with the progress just recorded of factory legislation since 1878. Consolidation was again earlier adopted when large amendments were found necessary, with the result that by far the greater part of the law is to be found in the act of 1887, which repealed and re-enacted, with amendments, the Coal Mines Acts of 1872 and 1886, and the [[Stratified Ironstone Mines (Gunpowder) Act 1881]]. The act of 1881 was simply concerned with rules relating to the use of explosives underground. The act of 1886 dealt with three questions: (a) The election and payment of checkweighers (i.e. the persons appointed and paid by miners in pursuance of section 13 of the act of 1887 for the purpose of taking a correct account on their behalf of the weight of the mineral gotten by them, and for the correct determination of certain deductions for which they may be liable); (''6'') provision for new powers of the secretary of state to direct a formal investigation of any explosion or accident, and its causes and circumstances, a provision which was later adopted in the law relating to factories; (''c'') provision enabling any relatives of persons whose death may have been caused by explosions or accidents in or about mines to attend in person, or by agent, coroners' inquests thereon, and to examine witnesses. The act of 1887, which amended, strengthened and consolidated these acts and the earlier Consolidating Act of 1872, may also be contrasted in another aspect with the general acts of factory legislation. In scope it formed, as its principal forerunner had done, a general code; and in some measure it went farther in the way of consolidation than the Factory Acts had done, inasmuch as certain questions, which in factories are dealt with by statutes distinct from the Factory Acts, have been included in the Mines Regulation Acts, ''e.g.'' the prohibition of the payment of wages in public-houses, and the machinery relating to weights and measures whereby miners control their payment; further, partly from the less changing nature of the industry, but probably mainly from the power of expression gained for miners by their organisation, the code, so far as it went, at each stage answered apparently on the whole more nearly to the views and needs of the persons protected than the parallel law relating to factories. This was strikingly seen in the evidence before the Royal Commission on Labour in 1892-1894, where the repeated expression of satisfaction on the part of the miners with the provisions as distinct from the administration of the code (" with a few trifling exceptions ") is in marked contrast with the long and varied series of claims and contentions put forward for amendment of the Factory Acts.

Since the act of 1887, there have followed five minor acts, based on the recommendation of the officials acting under the acts, while two of them give effect to claims made by the miners before the Royal Commission on Labour. Thus the [[Coal Mines (Checkweigher) Act 1894]] rendered it illegal for an employer (" owner, agent, or manager of any mine, or any person employed by or acting under the instructions of any such owner, agent, or manager ") to make the removal of a particular checkweigher a condition of employment, or to exercise improper influence in the appointment of a checkweigher. The need for this provision was demonstrated by a decision of the [[Court of Session]] in [[Edinburgh]], which upheld an employer in his claim to the right of dismissing all the workmen and re-engaging them on condition that they would dismiss a particular checkweigher. In 1896 a short act extended the powers to propose, amend and modify special rules, provided for representation of workmen on arbitration under the principal act on any matter in difference, modified the provision for plans of mines in working and abandoned mines, amended three of the general rules (inspection before commencing work, use of [[safety lamp]]s and non-inflammable substances for stemming), and empowered the secretary of state by order to prohibit or regulate the use of any explosive likely to become dangerous. In 1900, another brief act raised the age of employment of boys underground from twelve to thirteen. In 1903, another amending act allowed as an alternative qualification for a manager's certificate a diploma in scientific and mining training after at least two years' study at a university mining school or other educational institution approved by the secretary of state, coupled with practical experience of at least three years in a mine. In the same year, the Employment of Children Act affected children in mines to the extent already indicated in connexion with factories. In 1905, a Coal Mines (Weighing of Minerals) Act improved some provisions relating to appointment and pay of checkweighers and facilities for them and their duly appointed deputies in carrying out their duties. In 1906, the Notice of Accidents Act provided for improved annual returns of accidents and for immediate reporting to the district inspector of accidents under newly defined conditions as they arise in coal and metalliferous mines.

While the classes of mines regulated by the act of 1887 are the same as those regulated by the act of 1872 (i.e. mines of coal, of ''Act of'' stratified ironstone, of shale and of fire-clay, including, works above ground where the minerals are prepared for ''1887 '' use by screening, washing, &amp;c.) the interpretation of the term " mine " is wider and simpler, including " every [[shaft mining|shaft]] in the course of being sunk, and every level and inclined plane in the course of being driven, and all the shafts, levels, planes, works, tramways and sidings, both below ground and above ground, in and adjacent to and belonging to the mine." Of the persons responsible under penalty for the observance of the acts the term " owner " is defined precisely as in the act of 1872, but the term " agent " is modified to mean " any person appointed as the representative of the owner in respect of any mine or any part thereof, and, as such, superior to a manager appointed in pursuance of this act." Of the persons protected, the term " young person " disappeared from the act, and " boy," ''i.e. "'' a male under the age of sixteen years," and " girl," ''i.e. "'' a female under the age of sixteen years," take their place, and the term " woman " means, as before, " a female of the age of sixteen years and upwards." The prohibition of employment underground of women and girls remains untouched, and the pro hibition of employment underground of boys has been successively extended from boys of the age of ten in 1872 to boys of twelve in 1887 and to boys of thirteen in 1900. The age of employment of boys and girls above ground in connexion with any mine is raised from ten years in 1872 to twelve years since 1887. The hours of employment of a boy below ground may not exceed fifty-four in any one week, nor ten in any one day from the time of leaving the surface to the time of returning to the surface. Above ground any boy or girl under thirteen (and over twelve) may not be employed on more than six days in any one week; if employed on more than three days in one week, the daily total must not exceed six hours, or in any other case ten hours. Protected persons above thirteen are limited to the same daily and weekly total of hours as boys below ground, but there are further provisions with regard to intervals for meals and prohibiting employment for more than five hours without an interval of at least half an hour for a meal. Registers must be kept of all protected persons, whether employed above or below ground. Section 38 of the Public Health Act 1875, which requires separate and sufficient sanitary conveniences for persons of each sex, was first extended by the act of 1887 to the portions of mines above ground in which girls and women are employed; underground this matter is in metalliferous mines in [[Cornwall]] now provided for by special rules. Ventilation, the only other requirement in the acts that can be classed as sanitary, is provided for in every mine in the " general rules " which are aimed at securing safety of mines, and which, so far as ventilation is concerned, seek to dilute and render harmless noxious or inflammable gases. The provision which prohibits employment of any persons in mines not provided with at least two shafts is made much more stringent by the act of 1887 than in the previous code, by increasing the distance between the two shafts from 10 to 15 yds., and increasing the height of communications between them. Other provisions amended or strengthened are those relating to the following points: (a) Daily personal supervision of the mine by the certificated manager; (''b'') classes of certificates and constitution of board for granting certificates of competency; (''c'') plan of workings of any mine to be kept up to a date not more than three months previously at the office of the mine; (''d'') notice to be given to the inspector of the district by the owner, agent or manager, of accidents in or about any mine which cause loss of life or serious personal injury, or are caused by explosion of coal or coal dust or any explosive or electricity or any other special cause that the secretary of state specifies by order, and which causes any personal injury to any person employed in or about the mine; it is provided that the place where an explosion or accident occurs causing loss of life or serious personal injury shall be left for inspection for at least three days, unless this would tend to increase or continue a danger or impede working of the mine: this was new in the act of 1887; (''e'') notice to be given of opening and [[Abandoned property|abandonment]] of any mine: this was extended to the opening or abandonment of any seam; (''f'') plan of an abandoned mine or seam to be sent within three months; (g) formal investigation of any explosion or accident by direction of the secretary of state: this provision, first introduced by the act of 1886, was modified in 1887 to admit the appointment by the secretary of state of " any competent person " to hold the investigation, whereas under the earlier section only an inspector could be appointed.

The "general rules" for safety in mines have been strengthened in many ways since the act of 1872. Particular mention may be made of rule 4 of the act of 1887, relating to the inspection of conditions as to gas ventilation beyond appointed stations ''Gencrar '' at the entrance to the mine or different parts of the mine; this rule generally removed the earlier distinction between mines in which inflammable gas has been found within the preceding twelve months, and mines in which it has not been so found; of rules 8, 9, 10 and 11, relating to the construction, use, &amp;c., of safety lamps, which are more detailed and stringent than rule 7 of the act of 1872, which they replaced; of rule 12, relating to the use of explosives below ground; of rule 24, which requires the appointment of a competent male person not less than twenty-two years of age for working the machinery for lowering and raising persons at the mine; of rule 34, which first required provision of ambulances or stretchers with splints and bandages at the mine ready for immediate use; of rule 38, which strengthened the provision for periodical inspection of the mine by practical miners on behalf of the workmen at their own cost. With reference to the last-cited rule, during 1898 a Prussian mining commission visited Great Britain, France and Belgium, to study and compare the various methods of inspection by working miners established in these three countries. They found that, so far as the method had been applied, it was most satisfactory in Great Britain, where the whole cost is borne by the workers' own organisations, and they attributed part of the decrease in number of accidents per thousand employed since 1872 to the inauguration of this system.

The provisions as to the proposal, amendment and modification of " special rules," last extended by the act of 1896, may be contrasted with those of the Factory Act. In the latter ''Special '' it is not until an industry or process has been scheduled ''p '' as dangerous or injurious by the secretary of state's order that occasion arises for the formation of special rules, and then the initiative rests with the Factory Department whereas in mines it is [[incumbent]] in every case on the owner, agent or manager to propose within three months of the commencement of any working, for the approval of the secretary of state, special rules best calculated to prevent dangerous accidents, and to provide for the safety, convenience and proper discipline of the persons employed in or about the mine. These rules may, if they relate to lights and lamps used in the mine, description of explosives, watering and damping of the mine, or prevention of accidents from inflammable gas or coal dust, supersede any general rule in the principal act. Apart from the [[initiation]] of the rules, the methods of establishing them, whether by agreement or by resort to arbitration of the parties (i.e. the mine owners and the secretary of state), are practically the same as under the Factory Act, but there is special provision in the Mines Acts for enabling the persons working in the mine to transmit objections to the proposed rules, in addition to their subsequent right to be represented on the arbitration, if any.

Of the sections touching on wages questions, the prohibition of the payment of wages in public-houses remains unaltered, being re-enacted in 1887; the sections relating to payment by weight for amount of mineral gotten by persons employed, and for checkweighing the amount by a " checkweigher " stationed by the majority of workers at each place appointed for the weighing of the material, were revised, particularly as to the determination of deductions by the act of 1887, with a view to meeting some problems raised by decisions on cases under the act of 1872. The attempt seems not to have been wholly successful, the highest legal authorities having expressed conflicting opinions on the precise meaning of the terms " mineral contracted to be gotten." The whole history of the development of this means of securing the fulfilment of wage contract to the workers may be compared with the history of the sections affording protection to piece-workers by particulars of work and wages in the textile trades since the Factory Act of 1891.

As regards legal proceedings, the chief amendments of the act of 1872 are: the extension of the provision that the " owner, agent, ''Adminis-'' or manager " charged in respect of any contravention. by another person might be sworn and examined as an ''tratioa '' ordinary [[witness]], to any person charged with any offence under the act. The result of the proceedings against workmen by the owner, agent or manager in respect of an offence under the act is to be reported within twenty-one days to the inspector of the district. The powers of inspectors were extended to cover an inquiry as to the care and treatment of horses and other animals in the mine, and as to the control, management or direction of the mine by the manager.

The [[Coal Mines Regulation Act 1908]] limiting the hours of work for workmen below ground. It enacted that, subject to various provisions, a workman was not to be below ground in a mine for the purpose of his work, and of going to and from his work, for more than eight hours in any consecutive twenty-four hours. Exception was made in the case of those below ground for the purpose of rendering assistance in the event of an accident, or for meeting any danger, or for dealing with any emergency or work incompleted, through unforeseen circumstances, which requires to be dealt with to avoid serious interference in the work of the mine. The authorities of every mine must fix the times for the lowering and raising of the men to begin and be completed, and such times must be conspicuously posted at the [[Open-pit mining|pit]] head. These times must be approved by an inspector. The term " workman " in the act means any person employed in a mine below ground who is not an official of the mine (other than a fireman, examiner or deputy), or a mechanic or a [[horse]] keeper or a person engaged solely in [[surveying]] or measuring. In the case of a fireman, examiner, deputy, onsetter, [[pump]] minder, fanman or [[furnace]] man, the maximum period for which he may be below ground is nine hours and a half. A [[wikt:registry|registry]] must be kept by the authorities of the mine of the times of descent and ascent, while the workmen may, at their own cost, station persons (whether holding the office of checkweigher or not) at the pit head to observe the times. The authorities of the mine may extend the hours of working by one hour a day on not more than sixty days in one [[calendar]] year (s. 3). The act may be suspended by [[Order in Council|order in council]] in the event of war or of imminent national danger or great emergency, or in the event of any grave economic disturbance due to the demand for coal exceeding the supply available at any time. The act came into force on 1 July 1909 except for the counties of [[Northumberland]] and [[County Durham|Durham]] where its operation was postponed until 1 January 1910.

In 1905 the number of coal-mines reported on was 3126, and the number of persons employed below ground was 691,112 of whom 43,443 were under 16 years of age. Above ground 167,261 were employed, of whom 6154 were women and girls. The number of separate fatal accidents was 1006, causing the loss of 1205 lives. Of prosecutions by far the greater number were against workmen, numbering in coal and metalliferous mines 953; owners and managers were prosecuted in 72 cases, and convictions obtained in 43 cases.

==Quarries==
From 1878 until 1894 open quarries (as distinct from underground quarries regulated by the Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act) were regulated only by the Factory Acts so far as they then applied. It was laid down in section 93 of the act of 1878 (41 Vict. c. 16), that " any premises or place shall not be excluded from the definition of a factory or workshop by reason only that such premises, &amp;c., are or is in the open air," thereby overruling the decision in ''[[Kent v. Astley]]'' that quarries in which the work, as a whole, was carried on in the open air were not factories; in a schedule to the same act quarries were defined as " any place not being a mine in which persons work in getting [[slate]], stone, [[coprolite]]s or other minerals." The Factory Act of 1891 made it possible to bring these places in part under " special rules " adapted to meet the special risks and dangers of the operations carried on in them, and by order of the secretary of state they were certified, December 1892, as dangerous, and thereby subject to special rules. Until then, as reported by one of the inspectors of factories, quarries had been placed under the Factory Acts without insertion of appropriate rules for their safe working, and many of them were " developed in a most dangerous manner without any regard for safety, but merely for economy," and managers of many had " scarcely seen a [[quarry]] until they became managers." In his report for 1892 it was recommended by the chief inspector of factories that quarries should be subject to the jurisdiction of the government inspectors of mines. At the same time currency was given, by the published reports of the evidence before the Royal Commission on Labour, to the wish of large numbers of quarrymen that open as well as underground quarries should come under more specialised government inspection. In 1893 a committee of experts, including inspectors of mines and of factories, was appointed by the Home Office to investigate the conditions of labour in open quarries, and in 1894 the Quarries Act brought every quarry, as defined in the Factory Act 1878, any part of which is more than 20&amp;nbsp;ft. deep, under certain of the provisions of the Metalliferous Mines Acts, and under the inspection of the inspectors appointed under those acts; further, it transferred the duty of enforcing the Factory and Workshop Acts, so far as they apply in quarries over 20&amp;nbsp;ft. deep, from the Factory to the Metalliferous Mines inspectors.

The provisions of the [[Metalliferous Mines Acts 1872]] and 1875, applied to quarries, are those relating to payment of wages in public-houses, notice of accidents to the inspector, appointment and powers of inspectors, arbitration, coroners' inquests, special rules, penalties, certain of the definitions, and the powers of the secretary of state finally to decide disputed questions whether places come within the application of the acts. For other matters, and in particular fencing of machinery and employment of women and young persons, the Factory Acts apply, with a proviso that nothing shall prevent the employment of young persons (boys) in three shifts for not more than eight hours each. In 1899 it was reported by the inspectors of mines that special rules for safety had been established in over 2000 quarries. In the reports for 1905 it was reported that the accounts of [[Rock blasting|blasting]] accidents indicated that there was " still much laxity in observance of the Special rules, and that many irregular and dangerous practices are in vogue." The absence or deficiency of external fencing to a quarry dangerous to the public has been since 1887 (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. 19) deemed a [[nuisance]] liable to be dealt with summarily in the manner provided by the Public Health Act 1875.

In 1905, 94,819 persons were employed, of whom 59,978 worked inside the actual pits or excavations, and 34,841 outside. Compared with 1900, there was a total increase of 924 in the number of persons employed. Fatal accidents resulted in 1900 in 127 deaths; compared with 1899 there was an increase of To in the number of deaths, and, as Professor [[Sir Clement Le Neve Foster|Le Neve Foster]] pointed out, this exceeded the average death-rate of underground workers at mines under the Coal Mines Acts during the previous ten years, in spite of the quarrier " having nothing to fear from explosions of gas, underground fires or inundations." He attributed the difference to a lax observance of precautions which might in time be remedied by stringent administration of the law. In 1905 there were 97 fatal accidents resulting in 99 deaths. In 1900 there were 92 prosecutions against owners or agents, with 67 convictions, and 13 prosecutions of workers, with 12 convictions, and in 1905 there were 45 prosecutions of owners or agents with 43 convictions and 9 prosecutions of workmen with 5 convictions.

In 1883 a short act extended to all " workmen " who are manual labourers other than miners, with the exception of domestic or [[menial]] servants, the prohibition of payment of wages in public-houses, [[beer]]-shops and other places for the sale of spirituous or fermented liquor, laid down in the Coal. Mines Regulations and Metalliferous Mines Regulation Acts. The places covered by the prohibition include any office, [[garden]] or place belonging to or occupied with the places named, but the act does not apply to such wages as are paid by the resident, owner or occupier of the [[public house]], beer-shop and other places included in the prohibition to any workman ''[[bona fide]]'' employed by him. The penalty for an offence against this act is one not exceeding to (compare the limit of 20 for the corresponding,offence under the Coal Mines Act), and all offences may be prosecuted and penalties recovered in England and Scotland under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. The act does not apply to Ireland, and no special inspectorate is charged with the duty of enforcing its provisions.

'''''Van Orden v. Perry''''', 545 U.S. 677 (2005), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving whether a display of the [[Ten Commandments]] on a monument given to the government at the [[Texas]] [[Texas State Capitol|State Capitol]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].

In a suit brought by [[Thomas Van Orden]] of Austin, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] ruled in November 2003 that the displays were [[constitution]]al, on the grounds that the [[monument]] conveyed both a [[Religion|religious]] and [[Secular#Secular|secular]] message. Van Orden appealed, and in October 2004 the high court agreed to hear the case at the same time as it heard ''[[McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky]]'', a similar case challenging a display of the Ten Commandments at two county courthouses in [[Kentucky]].

The appeal of the 5th Circuit's decision was argued by [[Erwin Chemerinsky]], a [[constitutional law]] [[scholar]] and the [[Alston &amp; Bird]] Professor of Law at [[Duke University]] School of Law, who represented Van Orden on a ''[[pro bono]]'' basis. Texas' case was argued by Texas [[Attorney General]] [[Greg Abbott]].  An ''[[amicus curiae]]'' was presented on behalf of the respondents (the state of Texas) by then-[[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Paul Clement]].

The Supreme Court ruled on June 27, 2005, by a vote of 5 to 4, that the display was constitutional. The Court chose not to employ the popular [[Lemon test]] in its analysis, reasoning that the display at issue was a "passive monument."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/677/opinion.html|title=Van Orden v. Perry 545 U.S. 677 (2005)|website=Justia Law|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, the Court looked to "the nature of the monument and . . . our Nation’s history."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] delivered the plurality opinion of the Court; Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] concurred in the judgment but wrote separately. The similar case of ''McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky'' was handed down the same day with the opposite result (also with a 5 to 4 decision). The "[[swing vote]]" in both cases was Breyer.

== Background ==
[[Image:Ten Commandments Monument.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Ten Commandments Monument at the Texas State Capitol]]
The monument challenged was 6-feet high and 3-feet wide, and placed in 1961. It was donated to the State of Texas by the [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]], a civic organization, with the support of [[Cecil B. DeMille]], who had directed the film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/28/politics/28commandments.html|title=The Ten Commandments Reach the Supreme Court|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]] Online|accessdate=2010-02-10 | first=Linda | last=Greenhouse | date=February 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The State accepted the monument and selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state agency responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds. The donating organization paid for its erection. Two state legislators presided over the dedication of the monument.

The monument was erected on the Capitol grounds, behind the capitol building (between the Texas Capitol and [[Texas Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] buildings). The surrounding 22 acres (89,000 m²) contained 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating the "people, ideals, and events that compose Texan identity."

==Plurality opinion==
The [[plurality opinion]] stated that the monument was constitutional, as it represented historical value and not purely religious value. The primary content is the text of the [[Ten Commandments]]. An eagle grasping the American flag, an [[Eye of Providence|eye]] inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are two [[Star of David|Stars of David]] and the superimposed [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] [[Labarum|Chi and Rho]], which represent [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]. The bottom of the monument bears the inscription "PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY [[Fraternal Order of Eagles|THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES]] OF TEXAS 1961."

Below the above matter, and the title "the Ten Commandments", the monument's text reads in full:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I AM the LORD thy God.
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images.
Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thomas Van Orden challenged the constitutionality of the monument.  A native Texan, Van Orden passed by the monument frequently when he would go to the Texas Supreme Court building to use its law library.

Breyer's concurrence in this case is made all the more interesting because on the surface it appears that he voted quite differently in ''[[McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky]]'', a case which was heard and decided at the same time and seems, to the casual observer, virtually identical.  However, in ''Van Orden v. Perry'', Breyer submitted an [[opinion]] separate from that of the Court, while in ''McCreary'' he did not.  As a result, the ''Van Orden'' case was decided by a plurality, not a [[majority]] as the other.

In opening his discussion of reasoning Breyer states:

{{quote|The case before us is a borderline case. It concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the Ten Commandments located on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. On the one hand, the Commandments' text undeniably has a religious message, invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Deity. On the other hand, focusing on the text of the Commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this case. Rather, to determine the message that the text here conveys, we must examine how the text is used. And that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display.}}

He then goes on to list points which are stated to be insufficient individually, but together seem to provide a reasonable basis for "[[Secularity|secular purpose]]":

{{quote|
# The monument's 40-year history on the Texas state grounds indicates that nonreligious aspects of the tablets' message predominate.
# The group that donated the monument, the [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]], is a private civic (and primarily secular) organization.  Who, while interested in the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments' role in shaping civic morality as part of that organization's efforts to combat [[juvenile delinquency]].
# The Eagles' consulted with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian text &amp;mdash; an act which underscores the group's ethics-based motives.
# The tablets, as displayed on the monument, prominently acknowledge that the Eagles donated the display.
# The physical setting of the monument suggests little or nothing of the sacred.
#* The monument sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers, all designed to illustrate the "ideals" of those who settled in Texas and of those who have lived there since that time.
#* The setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity.
#* The setting does provide a context of history and moral ideals.
#* The larger display (together with the display's inscription about its origin) communicates to visitors that the State sought to reflect moral principles, illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the State's citizens, historically speaking, have endorsed. That is to say, the context suggests that the State intended the display's moral message &amp;mdash; an illustrative message reflecting the historical "ideals" of Texans &amp;mdash; to predominate.}}

Breyer then goes on to state:

{{quote|If these factors provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments' text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message, a further factor is determinative here. As far as I can tell, 40 years passed in which the presence of this monument, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner). And I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation. Hence, those 40 years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their system of beliefs, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect, primarily to promote religion over nonreligion, to "engage in" any "religious practic[e]," to "compel" any "religious practic[e]," or to "work deterrence" of any "religious belief." Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring). Those 40 years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets' message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage.}}

Breyer continues to explain a position which seeks to balance between not "lead[ing] the law to exhibit a [[hostility]] toward religion that has no place in our [[Establishment Clause|Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]] traditions" and "recogniz[ing] the danger of the [[slippery slope]]" and ultimately rests upon a "matter of degree [which] is, I believe, critical in a borderline case such as this one."

Breyer concludes by stating he cannot agree with the [[Plurality opinion|plurality]], nor with [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]]'s [[dissent]] in ''[[McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky]]'', but while he does agree with [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]]'s statement of principles in ''McCreary'', he disagrees with her evaluation of the evidence as it bears on the applying those principles to ''Van Orden v. Perry''.

== Stevens' dissent ==

Stevens' dissenting opinion essentially stated that, in formulating a ruling for this case, the court had to consider whether the display had any significant relation to the specific and secular history of the state of Texas or the United States as a whole. Ultimately, Stevens asserted that the display "has no purported connection to God's role in the formation of Texas or the founding of our Nation [. . .] " and therefore could not be protected on the basis that it was a display dealing with secular ideals. In fact, Stevens says that the display transmits the message that Texas specifically endorses the Judeo-Christian values of the display and thus, the display violates the establishment clause.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3156">The '''Women's Educational Equity Act''' (WEEA) of 1974 is one of the several landmark laws passed by the [[United States Congress]] outlining [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] protections against the gender [[discrimination]] of [[women]] in [[education]] ([[educational equity]]). WEEA was enacted as Section 513 of P.L. 93-380. Introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by Congresswoman [[Patsy Mink]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{Okina}}i]], the legislation was conceived and drafted by [[Arlene Horowitz]], a staff assistant to the education subcommittee on which Mink served.  WEEA was intended to combat sex-role stereotyping in [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[secondary school]]s.

In 1982, Leslie Wolfe, WEEA's director when [[Ronald Reagan]] was elected to the U.S. presidency, was transferred out of that position and people aligned with [[Phyllis Schlafly]]'s [[Eagle Forum]] were brought in to review grant proposals being considered for WEEA funds.  In 1984, Congress to rewrote the WEEA legislation making its mission and purpose more explicit and therefore keeping its actions true to its original goal.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Flora.  "Moving the Mountain:  The Women's Movement in America Since 1960".  New York, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991, pg. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Reagan Administration, the Assistant Secretary of Education, Jean Benish, implemented a review process which included all walks of people and provided a fair and equitable grant review process which was all inclusive of Women's Issues. In 1984, Congress rewrote the WEEA legislation making its mission and purpose more explicit.

In 2003, the [[George W. Bush administration]] ended [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal funds]] for WEEA's Resource Center, a mechanism for collection and sharing of information about gender equity programs.&lt;ref&gt;vivhdem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5896">'''Éire Nua''', or "New Ireland", was a proposal supported by the [[Provisional IRA]] and [[Sinn Féin]] during the 1970s and early 1980s for a [[Federation|federal]] [[United Ireland]]. The proposal was particularly associated with the [[Dublin]]-based leadership group centered on [[Ruairí Ó Brádaigh]] and [[Dáithí Ó Conaill]], who were the authors of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;See White, Robert William and Ed Moloney, ''Ruairí Ó Brádaigh: the life and politics of an Irish Revolutionary'' (2006), especially Chapter 11 "The Politics of Revolution."&lt;/ref&gt;

Éire Nua is still supported by the [[Continuity IRA]], [[Republican Sinn Féin]], [[Na Fianna Éireann]] and [[Cumann na mBan]].

==Ideology==
Éire Nua envisaged an all-[[Ireland]] republic that would be created when the British withdrew from [[Northern Ireland]]. It also involved the dissolution of the existing [[Republic of Ireland]], which many republicans considered an illegitimate entity imposed by the British in 1922. Under Éire Nua, Ireland would become a [[Federation|federal]] state with parliaments for each of its four historic [[Provinces of Ireland|provinces]], as well as a central parliament based in [[Athlone]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagan Jack, "Sinn Fein (Kevin Street) Plan for New Ireland", Irish Times, June 29, 1972 (pp. 1, 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the federal structure was twofold. Firstly, it was intended to show [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]] in [[Northern Ireland]] that they would have some kind of self-government in a [[united Ireland]]. This would be achieved by the provision of a parliament, ''Dáil Uladh'', for [[Ulster]]. However, by including all of historic Ulster—nine counties instead of the six in Northern Ireland—it was intended that the unionist majority would be slim enough to prevent abuses against the Catholic/nationalist population in the province.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Alvin. ''Home Rule : An Irish History, 1800–2000''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2003 (pp. 306–7) .&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, the federal parliaments were intended to redress the perceived economic imbalance between the eastern and western parts of Ireland, and was hoped to enable prosperity in the poorer west of the country.

==Irish reactions and decline in popularity==
Many members of Sinn Féin, particularly in Northern Ireland, objected to Éire Nua on the grounds that it would perpetuate the dominance of Protestant unionists in the north of the country. Despite this, Éire Nua committees were established at least in Ulster and Connacht, largely due to the efforts of [[Desmond Fennell]] and Emmett O'Connell.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, Desmond. ''A New Nationalism for the New Ireland''. Comhairle Uladh, 1973 (p. 2) .&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the scheme was dismissed as unworkable by some influential Republicans. When Northern Republicans grouped around [[Gerry Adams]] gained control of the IRA and Sinn Féin in the late 1970s, they attacked the policy. In 1982, the Sinn Féin [[Ard Fheis]] voted to drop the policy, and the following year all reference to it in the Sinn Féin Constitution and rules was removed, and it was removed as the policy of the Republican movement in favour of the creation of a [[Unitary state|unitary]] Irish Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Tonge, Jonathan. ''Northern Ireland''. Polity, 2006 (p. 105).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ó Brádaigh and his supporters walked out of the 1986 Ard Fheis after a motion was passed that ended the Republican policy of [[abstentionism]] to the [[Oireachtas]] and reconvened the Ard Fheis at the West County Hotel in the village of [[Chapelizod]] just west of Dublin. Henceforth referring to itself as [[Republican Sinn Féin]] to distinguish itself from former associates, the party still advocates the Éire Nua agenda.

==US reactions==
The reaction of the US administration to Éire Nua was mixed.  Due in large part to [[Irish-American]] pressure at home, a synopsis of Éire Nua was entered into the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' as a solution that "merits consideration" to the crisis in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Extension of Remarks.  Congressional Record of the 93rd Congress: First Session Volume 119, Number 103; Friday June 29, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials in Ireland were less optimistic, placing more hope in the [[Sunningdale Agreement]].  Ambassador John Moore did note, however: "In long term, some sort of federated Ireland seems a real possibility, but path to it seems more likely to be the pragmatic Sunningdale route than the dramatic one advocated by [[Desmond Boal|Boal]] and the Provos."&lt;ref name="1974DUBLIN00184_b"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Moore| first = John| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Catholic and Protestant Extremists Discuss Similar Solutions| id={{WikiLeaks cable|1974DUBLIN00184_b}} |work =| publisher =[[WikiLeaks]]| date =1974-02-05| url =https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1974DUBLIN00184_b.html | doi =| accessdate =2014-05-25|archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
