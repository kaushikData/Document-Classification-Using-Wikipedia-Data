'''666 Fifth Avenue''' is a 41-story [[office building]] on [[Fifth Avenue]] between [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd]] and [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd]] Streets in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tishmanspeyer.com/properties/Property.aspx?id=41 |archivedate=June 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628001201/http://www.tishmanspeyer.com/properties/Property.aspx?id=41 |title=666 Fifth Avenue |website=tishmanspeyer.com |publisher=Tishman Speyer Properties |accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office tower was designed by [[Carson &amp; Lundin]] and built in 1957 by [[Tishman Realty and Construction]], which sold it when the corporation dissolved in 1976. 666 Fifth Avenue was bought by [[Sumitomo Realty &amp; Development]] in the late 1990s, and [[Tishman Speyer]] bought it back in 2000, adding tenants before selling it yet again to [[Kushner Properties]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="Bagli NYT" /&gt; In August 2018, [[Brookfield Asset Management|Brookfield Properties]] took a 99-year lease on 666 Fifth Avenue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==Ownership and history==
[[Image:666fifth-front.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Front of 666 Fifth Avenue]]

===Construction, Tishman ownership, and sales===
The Tishman family via [[Tishman Realty and Construction]] built the {{convert|1500000|sqft|adj=on}} tower in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.com/2007/01/666-fifth-avenue-deal-closes/|title=666 Fifth Avenue Deal Closes|author=Staff |work=[[The New York Observer]] |date=January 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by [[Carson &amp; Lundin]], who also simultaneously worked on [[600 Fifth Avenue]] in the nearby [[Rockefeller Center]], and the building was called the Tishman Building. One of its most famous exterior features was the prominent [[666 (number)|666]] address emblazoned on the top of the building. The other distinctive exterior features are embossed aluminum panels. The original design included lobby sculptures by Japanese American artist and landscape architect [[Isamu Noguchi]], including the "Landscape of the Cloud" which consists of sinuously cut thin railings in the ceiling to create a cloud effect. The cloud is also carried into a ceiling-to-floor waterfall. The penthouse was occupied by the Top of the Sixes restaurant, operated by [[Stouffer's]], which closed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/18/nyregion/no-more-of-tables-for-two-at-the-top-of-the-sixes.html|title=No More of Tables for Two at the Top of the Sixes|first=David |last=Stout|work=The New York Times |date=September 18, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years the building had a distinctive feature of a T-shaped atrium walk-through open to the sidewalks on 52nd Street, 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue with glass storefronts inside the walk-through. This included a bookstore and another area used for years by [[Alitalia]] Airlines. For many years, the building was the home of [[Benton &amp; Bowles]], a major advertising firm.

Tishman Realty dissolved in 1976 and the building was sold for $80 million (about ${{Inflation|US-GDP|80|1976|r=-1}} million in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}). In the late 1980s, Japanese firms bought both [[Rockefeller Center]] and 666 Fifth Avenue. The new owner of 666 Fifth was Japanese realty and development company [[Sumitomo Realty &amp; Development|Sumitomo]]. Major changes included replacing the Top of the Sixes restaurant with the Grand Havana Room, a [[cigar bar]] private club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/grand-havana-room-2013-2?op=1 |title=Tour The Exclusive Cigar Club Where Wall Streeters And Charlie Gasparino Love To Hang Out|first=Julia |last=La Roche|work=[[Business Insider]] |date=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly reconstituted [[Tishman Speyer Properties]] bought the building for $518 million in 2000 (about ${{Inflation|US-GDP|518|2000|r=-1}} million in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}), and about the same time Tishman also bought Rockefeller Center. Shortly after the purchase, Tishman enclosed the atrium walk-through and added a third tenant, [[Hickey Freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecityreview.com/fifth666.html |work=The Midtown Book |title=The Tishman Building  |first=Carter B. |last=Horsley |accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enclosure cut off the Fifth Avenue entrance, and access now has to be via 52nd or 53rd Street. In 2002 the 666 address on the side of the building was replaced with a [[Citigroup]] logo, and Citigroup is now the building's largest tenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nreionline.com/news/Top_Price_for_Top_of_the_Sixes/ |title=Top Price for Top of the Sixes |publisher=National Real Estate Investor |first=Parke |last=Chapman |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=September 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203080735/http://nreionline.com/news/Top_Price_for_Top_of_the_Sixes |archive-date=February 3, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 sale was the third blockbuster deal involving Tishman in two years. In 2005 Tishman bought the [[MetLife Building]] for $1.72 billion (about ${{Inflation|US-GDP|1.72|2005|r=1}} billion in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}), setting the previous record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/02/nyregion/metlife-sells-second-tower-in-a-week.html |title=Sells 2nd Building, A Landmark On Park Ave.|first=Anthony |last=Ramirez |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month before the 666 sale, Tishman bought [[Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village]] for $5.4 billion, which was the biggest real estate deal in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/18/nyregion/18stuyvesant.html|title=Sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village Goes Through Despite Some Tenants' Efforts|first=Charles V. |last=Baglidec|work=The New York Times |date =November 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repurposing===
In January 2007, Tishman Speyer, along with the German investment firm TMW, announced the sale of the building to the [[Kushner Properties]] for $1.8 billion (about ${{Inflation|US-GDP|1.8|2006|r=1}} billion in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}), at the time the highest price ever paid for an individual building in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="Bagli NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/07/nyregion/07building.html |title=Big Deal, Even in Manhattan: A Tower Goes for $1.8 Billion|first=Charles V. |last=Bagli |work=The New York Times |date=December 7, 2006 |accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an unconventional price for such a short building by New York standards, standing at {{convert|483|ft|abbr=on}}. 666 Fifth is not among the [[list of tallest buildings in New York City|top 100 tallest buildings in New York City]], but its high price was mainly because of its location on Fifth Avenue near [[Rockefeller Center]]. Kushner sold the retail condominium portion of 666 Fifth to a [[Stanley Chera]]-led group for $525 million in 2008 (about ${{Inflation|US-GDP|525|2008|r=-1}} million in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.com/2008/07/carlyle-group-buys-stake-in-666-fifth-retail-for-525-m/ |title=Carlyle Group Buys Stake in 666 Fifth Retail for $525 M. |website=Observer |first=Dana |last=Rubinstein |date=July 1, 2008 |accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, reports were made that [[Anbang Insurance Group]] of China was in talks to purchase an interest in the building, based on a value of $2.85 billion ($1.6 billion for the office section, and $1.25 billion for the retail section); some of the alleged terms of the deal were called "unusually favorable," including an exit for [[Vornado Realty Trust]] and retirement of the Kushner organization's remaining debt at 20 cents on the dollar, raising concerns about political influence on the [[presidency of Donald Trump|Donald Trump presidential administration]] due to [[Jared Kushner]]'s position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=March 13, 2017|title=Kushners Set to Get $400 Million From Chinese Firm on Tower|author=David Kocieniewski and Caleb Melby |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-13/kushners-set-to-get-400-million-from-chinese-on-marquee-tower}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the reports were made, Anbang denied that they were looking to invest in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=March 14, 2017|title=China's Anbang denies report of Kushner property investment|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-anbang-group-kushner-idUSKBN16L2TS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, [[Zaha Hadid Architects]] announced plans for a $12 billion, 1,400 foot skyscraper being developed by the Kushner organization to replace the current building. The new building, to include retail and residential space and a hotel, would be completed by 2025 at the earliest, and would face a park, created by razing a block of current buildings. The developers also plan to change the name to 660 Fifth Avenue, to avoid the diabolical association with the number [[Number of the Beast|666]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Howarth |title=Zaha Hadid Architects unveils 666 Fifth Avenue skyscraper for Kushner Companies |url=https://www.dezeen.com/2017/03/23/zaha-hadid-architects-666-fifth-avenue-skyscraper-compared-glass-dildo-architecture-offices/ |work=[[Dezeen]] |date=March 23, 2017 |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kriston |last=Capps |title=666 Fifth Avenue Is the Perfect Symbol for the Trump Era |url=https://www.citylab.com/design/2017/03/666-fifth-avenue-is-the-perfect-symbol-for-the-trump-era/520563/ |work=[[The Atlantic#CityLab|CityLab]] |date=March 24, 2017 |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans to replace the current building were later withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kushners are ‘weighing our options’ for the future of 666 Fifth Avenue - Curbed NY|periodical=ny.curbed.com|publisher=|url=https://ny.curbed.com/2018/4/10/17219036/kushner-companies-midtown-666-fifth-avenue-sale|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=April 17, 2018|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 2017, Charles Kushner met with Qatari [[Finance Minister]] [[Ali Sharif Al Emadi|Sharif Al Emadi]] in an attempt to secure funding for the tower from [[Qatar]]'s [[sovereign wealth fund]]. Emadi did not agree to invest Qatar's fund in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Intercept]]|date=March 2, 2018|title=Jared Kushner's Real Estate Firm Sought Money Directly From Qatar Government Weeks Before Blockade|url=https://theintercept.com/2018/03/02/jared-kushner-real-estate-qatar-blockade/|author=Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one month later, the [[2017-18 Qatar diplomatic crisis]] began. Jared Kushner reportedly undermined [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Rex Tillerson]]'s efforts to resolve the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|title=Trump Team’s Shifts Jolt Some Allies and Soothe Others| author=Mark Landler and Gardiner Harris| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/world/middleeast/rex-tillerson-calls-for-calm-in-middle-east-standoff-with-qatar.html| date=June 9, 2017| accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The headquarters for [[DC Comics]] was located at 666 Fifth Avenue before moving to 1700 Broadway in the 1990s.{{Cn|date=July 2018}}

==Subway entrance==
The building contains an entrance to the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[Fifth Avenue/53rd Street (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Fifth Avenue/53rd Street]] station, which is served by the {{NYCS trains|Queens 53rd}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NYCS map|Midtown East}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Hollister Co. store was opened, polished gray columns were placed in the lobby near the elevators and changes were made to the [[New York City Subway|subway]] entrance at the base of the building.

==In popular culture==
The opening lunch scene for the movie ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' was filmed in the former Top of the Sixes restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The scandalous history behind Kushner’s ritzy Midtown building | website=New York Post | date=April 18, 2017 | url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/18/the-scandalous-history-behind-kushners-ritzy-midtown-building/ | access-date=February 20, 2018|quote=In his 2007 memoir, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” Jordan Belfort recalled lunching at Top of the Sixes with a pal from LF Rothschild, downstairs. “It was where Masters of the Universe could get blitzed on martinis and exchange war stories,” Belfort wrote, as depicted in the 2013 movie.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Skyscraper'' was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|Academy Award]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1960|title=The 32nd Academy Awards {{!}} 1960|work=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|access-date=January 22, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in [[Mad Men (season 4)|season 4]] of ''[[Mad Men]]'', when SCD&amp;P move into the Time-Life Building, the "666" on top of the building can be seen in many scenes, through the window just outside of Don Draper’s office.

'''''ARTnews''''' is an American visual-arts magazine, based in [[New York City]]. It covers art from ancient to [[Post-modernism|contemporary]] times. It includes news dispatches from correspondents, investigative reports, reviews of exhibitions, and profiles of artists and collectors.

==History and operations==
The magazine was founded by James Clarence Hyde in 1902 as '''''Hydes Weekly Art News''''' and was originally published eleven times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to Serial Publications Founded Prior to 1918 and Now Or Recently Current in Boston, Cambridge, and Vicinity|last=Homer|first=Thomas Johnston|publisher=Trustees of the Public Library|year=1922|isbn=|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=20|quote=|via=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qVEAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;ots=rVDu3_6L2G&amp;dq=artnews%201902&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=artnews%201902&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyideas.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/mcleans_1902.pdf "McLean’s 1902 Letter"] [[PDF|PDF format]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

From vol. 3, no. 52 (November 5, 1904) to vol. 21, no. 18 (February 10, 1923), the magazine was published as '''''American Art News'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to Serial Publications Founded Prior to 1918 and Now Or Recently Current in Boston, Cambridge, and Vicinity|last=Homer|first=Thomas Johnston|publisher=Trustees of the Public Library|year=1922|isbn=|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=20|quote=|via=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qVEAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;ots=rVDu3_6L2G&amp;dq=artnews%201902&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=artnews%201902&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;From February 1923 to the present, the magazine has been published as ''The Art News'' then ''ARTnews''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/746445 ARTNews], National Library of Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine's [[art critic]]s and correspondents include [[Arthur Danto]], Linda Yablonsky, Barbara Pollock, Margarett Loke, Hilarie Sheets, [[Yale School of Art]] dean [[Robert Storr (art academic)|Robert Storr]],&lt;ref&gt;Staff (undated).

''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Milton and Judith Esterow, the magazine's owners since 1972, sold the publication to Skate Capital Corp., a private asset-management firm owned by Sergey Skaterschikov.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}--&gt;{{registration required|date=August 2014}} Cohen, Patricia (April 8, 2014).

==The ''ARTNews'' Top 200 Collectors==
The ''ARTNews'' Top 200 list is released annually and contains the top individual art collectors from around the world based on interviews with collectors, curators, dealers, auction houses, and museums. Those on the list are also surveyed, and their responses are used to inform trends and provide data, such as a breakdown of where the most top art collectors live (the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/11/where-do-the-worlds-top-art-collectors-live/|title=Where do the world's top art collectors live|last=|first=|date=|website=Foreign Policy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  

Collectors on the list are profiled with a brief biography focused on the type of art that they collect (contemporary, post war, modern, etc.) and includes their city or cities of residence, a photo, their source of wealth and the years they have been on the Top 200 list, as many collectors are on it for multiple years. The list released in September 2018 includes [[Leonard Lauder]], Edythe and [[Eli Broad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/top200/edythe-l-and-eli-broad/|title=ARTNews Top 200: Edythe and Eli Broad|last=|first=|date=|website=Art News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [http://www.artnews.com/top200/eisenberg-family/ Rebecca and Warren Eisenberg], [http://www.artnews.com/top200/alison-and-peter-w-klein/ Alison and Peter Klein], Marsha and [[Jeffrey E.

'''Adam Kyler Petty''' (July 10, 1980 &amp;ndash; May 12, 2000) was a professional racing driver. He was the first fourth-generation driver in [[NASCAR]] history.

==Early life==
Petty was raised in [[High Point, North Carolina]] into [[stock car]] racing "royalty". The son of [[Kyle Petty]], he was widely expected to become the next great Petty, following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather [[Richard Petty|Richard]], and great-grandfather [[Lee Petty|Lee]]. He was the first known fourth-generation athlete in all of modern American motor sports to participate in the chosen profession of his generations.

==Racing career==
Petty began his career in 1998, shortly after he turned 18, in the [[ARCA RE/MAX Series]]. Like his father Kyle, he won his first ARCA race, driving the #45 [[Pontiac]] at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]].

Petty moved to [[NASCAR Nationwide Series|NASCAR Busch Series]] full-time in 1999, driving the #45 [[Chevrolet]]. Petty finished sixth in his first Busch Series race at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] and had a best finish of fourth place, though he also failed to qualify for three of the Busch races.  Petty finished the 1999 season 20th overall in points.

[[Petty Enterprises]] planned to have Petty run a second Busch season in 2000, while giving him seven starts in the [[2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series]], in preparation for a full Winston Cup campaign in 2001.  He struggled early in the Busch season, but managed to qualify in his first attempt at Winston Cup during the [[2000 DirecTV 500|DirecTV 500]] at [[Texas Motor Speedway]] on April 2. He qualified 33rd and ran in the middle of the pack most of the day before his engine expired, forcing him to finish 40th. Adam never got to race alongside his father. Kyle failed to qualify and eventually relieved an ill [[Elliott Sadler]], but Adam was already out of the race. [[Lee Petty]], Adam's great-grandfather, and 3-time NASCAR Champion, lived to see his Winston debut, but died just three days later.

==Death==
In a practice session for the [[Busch 200 (New Hampshire)|Busch 200]] race&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/races/2000/results-official/12/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814172208/http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/races/2000/results-official/12/ |archivedate=2011-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]], Petty's throttle stuck wide open at turn three, causing the car to hit the outside wall virtually head on. Petty was killed instantly when he suffered a [[basilar skull fracture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/news/2000/05/12/petty_crash/ |title=CNNSI.com - Motor Sports - Adam Petty killed in practice crash at NHIS - Friday July 07, 2000 02:33 PM |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2000-07-07 |accessdate=2013-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 19 years old.

Petty's death, along with 1998 Winston Cup [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] [[Kenny Irwin Jr.]]'s in the same corner at the same track eight weeks later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/auto/nascar/news/2000/0707/623002.html |title=ESPN.com - Auto Racing - Irwin killed in same turn as Adam Petty |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; led NASCAR to mandate the use of a [[kill switch]] on the steering wheel and the adoption of the [[Whelen Modified Tour]] [[restrictor plate]] for the September Cup race; the plate was abandoned after that race.  These two adjustments addressed the cause of the deadly accidents, but did not address the basilar skull fractures suffered by both drivers. The [[HANS device|HANS]] or [[Hutchens device|Hutchens]] devices, designed to prevent the rapid-deceleration head-and-neck movements associated with the injury that Petty and Irwin Jr. suffered, was not mandated by NASCAR until 2001, after similar injuries and deaths of [[Tony Roper (racing driver)|Tony Roper]], [[Dale Earnhardt]] and ARCA driver [[Blaise Alexander]].

Kyle Petty, who drove the No. 44 car at the time of the crash, drove Adam's No. 45 car in the Busch Series for the remainder of 2000.  He then used the No. 45 in the Cup Series throughout the rest of his driving career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/driver/pettyky01 |title=Kyle Petty Career Statistics |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |date=1960-06-02 |accessdate=2013-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:George W. Bush at Victory Junction Gang Camp - Randleman, N.C. with NASCAR drivers.jpg|thumb|President [[George W. Bush]] is joined at Adam's Race Shop on the grounds of Victory Junction Gang Camp, Inc., in Randleman, N.C., by Kyle and Richard Petty, [[Michael Waltrip]] and [[Jimmie Johnson]].]]
In October 2000, five months after Petty's death, his family partnered with [[Paul Newman]] and the [[Hole in the Wall Gang Camp]] to begin the Victory Junction Gang Camp in [[Randleman, North Carolina]] as a memorial to Petty. The camp has received support from many NASCAR drivers, teams, and sponsors, including Cup Series sponsor Sprint, which has placed a replica of Petty's 1998 car in the camp. The camp began operation in 2004 and is an official charity of NASCAR.

Petty also appears as a special guest driver in the video games ''[[NASCAR 2000]]'', ''[[NASCAR Rumble]]'', ''[[NASCAR 2001]]'' and ''[[NASCAR Arcade]]''.

In December 2013, his brother Austin named his newborn son after Adam in tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richter|first=Josh|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/shake-and-bake/gen-5-petty-the-king-meets-his-great-grandson-adam-121613|title=Gen-5 Petty: "The King" meets his great-grandson Adam|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=2013-12-16|accessdate=2013-12-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217052751/http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/shake-and-bake/gen-5-petty-the-king-meets-his-great-grandson-adam-121613|archivedate=2013-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3203">'''Andrew Jameson''' [[Privy Council of Ireland|PC (Ire)]] [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] (17 August 1855 – 15 February 1941) was a Scottish-born Irish public servant, politician and businessman.

Jameson was born in [[Alloa]], [[Clackmannanshire]], [[Scotland]]. He was educated at [[London International College]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and [[Trinity College, Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=JM873A|name=Jameson, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1896 to 1898 he was Governor of the [[Bank of Ireland]], remaining a director until 1941. In 1902 he was [[High Sheriff of County Dublin]]. He was also chairman of the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights|Irish Lights Commission]], which administered lighthouses in Ireland. He was president of the [[Dublin Chamber of Commerce]] in 1921–22.

In 1917 he was a member of the unsuccessful [[Irish Convention]]. He was appointed to the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] in the 1921 New Year Honours, entitling him to the style "The Right Honourable".

From 1922 to 1936 Jameson served as a [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Senator]] of the [[Irish Free State]].&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;HouseNum=1922&amp;MemberID=1399&amp;ConstID=214|title=Mr. Andrew Jameson|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the Memorial Committee set up to establish the [[Irish National War Memorial Gardens]], in December 1930 he advised [[W. T. Cosgrave]], President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, who was very interested in bringing the memorial to fruition, on the suitability of the site running along the south bank of the [[River Liffey]]; this site was eventually decided upon by Cosgrave and agreed by the committee.
 
Jameson was also chairman of the whiskey distillers [[Jameson Irish Whiskey|John Jameson &amp; Son Ltd]].

In 1877 he married Grace (1854–1922), daughter of Dr William Malachy Burke of [[Loughrea]]. They had four children, including the painter [[Harriet Kirkwood]]. He married secondly, in 1924, Ruth Hart, daughter of [[George Vaughan Hart (academic)|George Vaughan Hart]] of [[Howth]], County Dublin. They had no children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgoakley.org/efa/1851HHM.html Andrew Jameson, Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baltimore Convention Center''' is a convention and exhibition hall located in downtown [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. The Center is a municipal building owned and operated by the City of Baltimore. The facility was constructed in two separate phases: the original Center, with {{convert|425,000|sqft|m2}} of exhibition and meeting space, opened in August 1979 at a cost of $51.4 million. A $151 million expansion, which increased the Center's total size to {{convert|1225000|sqft|m2}}, was completed in April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bccenter.org/about/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123162426/http://www.bccenter.org/about/index.html |archive-date=2005-11-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 752-room, city-owned [[Hilton Baltimore]] hotel opened in August 2008, connected to the convention center by an enclosed skywalk bridge. Another expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center has been proposed at an estimated cost of $400 million that includes a new 500 room hotel and an 18,500 seat arena; this project is estimated to cost $900 million, this proposal is no longer active and considered dead. As of March 2016, the State of Maryland is going to explore expanding the Baltimore Convention Center for an estimated cost of $600 million and build a new hotel attached to the expansion. As of August 2016, the proposal of having a combined expanded convention center, arena and hotel has been revived. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake requested a $1 million feasibility study from the Maryland Stadium Authority which was approved on August 2, 2016. As of September 2017, Phase 1 of the feasibility study has begun with the release expected to be sometime by the end of 2017&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2017/09/22/baltimore-convention-center-1expansion-study-gets.html|title=Baltimore Convention Center $1M expansion study gets underway|last=Simmons|first=Melody|date=September 22, 2017|work=Baltimore Business Journal|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On July 6, 2018, the Maryland Stadium Authority finally released Phase 1 of the feasibility study. 

==History==
As was the case with [[Harborplace]], which opened in 1980; the [[Maryland Science Center]], which opened in 1976; and the [[National Aquarium in Baltimore]], which opened in 1981, the Convention Center was intended to be a catalyst for tourism, an important part of the City's post-manufacturing economic development plans. An Abell Foundation report in June 2005 describes the Convention Center as having been "built as an economic development tool to attract to Baltimore conventions, trade shows, and meetings that would leave in the city millions of dollars spent on lodging, food, entertainment, and other services." (Controversy, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;3) A report on economic development in the area, entitled ''Subsidizing the Low Road: Economic Development in Baltimore'', states that "public and non-profit facilities such as the Maryland Science Center, the [[Baltimore World Trade Center|World Trade Center]], the Convention Center, and the National Aquarium" (''Subsidizing'', 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;11) were part of then-mayor Schaefer's "focus on real estate, retailing and tourism sectors" (p.&amp;nbsp;10), as areas for growth, as well as his utilization of "'public/private partnerships' to pursue economic development" (p.&amp;nbsp;11).

During the next two decades, due in part to the success of the Convention Center and the other attractions, [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], Sports Legends Museum at Camden Yards, [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]], [[Power Plant Live!]], and the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African-American History, have joined the area, creating a ten-block plus entertainment and cultural destination at Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]], further increasing tourist dollars flowing into the region.

A June 2005 Greater Baltimore Committee report on tourism in Baltimore illustrates the importance of tourism in the current Baltimore region's economy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hospitality and tourism and the convention industry are vital components of the region’s economy. According to the Baltimore Area Convention and Visitors Association (BACVA), spending from domestic travelers in 2002 was $8.476 billion statewide; $2.8 billion in Baltimore alone. This spending supported $719 million in state and local taxes while providing over 44,000 regional jobs. (Voices, 2005)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One major convention held in the convention center was [[Otakon]], a convention that focuses on anime and other facets of East Asian culture.

Washington Convention Center]] in Washington, DC for at least five years starting in 2017. Convention officials cited space concerns, along with the uncertainty of construction plans for the convention center and a new arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Otakon to Move to Washington D.C. in 2017|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-11/otakon-to-move-to-washington-d.c-in-2017|work=Anime News Network|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WBAL-TV, Baltimore's local NBC news affiliate, due to the pending departure of Otakon in 2017 to Washington D.C., concerns were mounting regarding Baltimore's economic future when it came to tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Otakon to leave Baltimore, prompting expansion talk - Tourism officials examine options|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/otakon-to-leave-baltimore-prompting-expansion-talk/-/10131532/21437832/-/pl67ls/-/index.html|work=WBAL|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Otakon's final year in Baltimore, 29,113 people attended, a decline from its peak attendance of 34,211 in 2013.

The Convention Center is also viewed as important to the recent development on Baltimore's West Side. According to Ronald M. Kreitner, executive director of West Side Renaissance Inc., the "Convention Center will help contribute to the success of the theaters and the retail," referring to the development of the France-Merrick Performing Arts Center/Hippodrome Theatre, as well as new retail ventures in the area. (Renaissance, 2003)

By 2013, the center was playing a major role in the city's tourism growth, with conventions, seminars, conferences and exhibitions helping boost visitor numbers that year to 23.9 million, and expenditure by visitors to $5.15 billion. [[Visit Baltimore]] President Tom Noonan noted in July 2014 Baltimore was leading other cities in terms of future convention center bookings, through until 2021.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreTourism"&gt;{{cite news|title=Visitor arrivals to Baltimore jump more than 12 percent|url=http://www.baltimorenews.net/index.php/sid/224243405/scat/57bb66ae98bf0999/ht/Visitor-arrivals-to-Baltimore-jump-more-than-12-percent|accessdate=29 July 2014|publisher=Baltimore News.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, a ''Baltimore Sun'' article revealed that Otakon wasn't the only large convention that Baltimore City lost due to the current size of the Baltimore Convention Center. The article reports that as of the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2016, Visit Baltimore hosted 415 total event with a combined estimated economic impact of $180 million, the city usually hosts 20 to 30 large conventions annually however city officials are now stating the convention center is too small to be competitive with other cities. The article also reports that at least 10 large conventions have left Baltimore due to outgrowing the convention center and these conventions were held at the convention center during the previous 10 years and the total of 10 large conventions includes Otakon which as of 2017 will be held at the much larger Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington D.C. The article also reports that future conventions are at risk of leaving Baltimore as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-convention-center-20161228-story.html|title=Baltimore officials welcome conventions looking to leave North Carolina|last=Prudente|first=Yvonne Wenger, Tim|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Despite the continuing growth and redevelopment in the area, the expanded Convention Center has not met expectations with respect to the number of conventions and people it attracts each year. Irene E. Van Sant, then-manager of the Convention Center Hotel Project for the [[Baltimore Development Corporation]], Baltimore's former Mayor [[Sheila Dixon]], and Governor of Maryland [[Martin O'Malley]]—feel that a hotel adjacent to the Convention Center will make it a more appealing site for conventions. The completion of the [[Walter E. Washington Convention Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and the [[National Harbor]] project in [[Prince George's County]] intensified the debate.

In general, supporters of a convention hotel say that for the Convention Center to be viable in the future, and compete with other cities for conventions, a new "Headquarters" hotel is necessary to guarantee enough rooms for group meetings. Opponents of the hotel project have either questioned the necessity of a new hotel altogether or objected to the use of public dollars to finance the project.  The Baltimore Convention Center hotel, named [[Hilton Baltimore]], broke ground in February 2006 and opened in August 2008.  It has 752 rooms and is the city's largest hotel, connected directly to the Convention Center via sky bridge.  Baltimore City used public revenue bonds to cover the $301.7 million cost of building the hotel.

===First proposed arena-hotel-convention center project (2010–2016)===
When the 1996 expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center opened, the convention center was ranked 28th largest in the nation in terms of exhibition and meeting space. By 2011, the convention center plummeted to 73rd largest and, as a result, Baltimore is losing convention business. Visit Baltimore reports that the Hilton Baltimore Convention Center Hotel that opened in August 2008 is helping, but since the opening of the Hilton the city has lost over 700,000 hotel-night bookings due to the convention center being too small to meet the needs of a group or the dates the group wanted was not available.

It has been argued that if Baltimore does not expand its convention center, the city could "fall off the map as a potential convention choice." Nearby cities have or are in the process of expanding convention and hotel space, such as Washington D.C. (opened the [[Walter E. Washington Convention Center]] in 2003 with plans to open a 1,175-room Marriott Marquis hotel with {{convert|100000|sqft}} of convention and meeting space in 2013) and Philadelphia (expanded its [[Pennsylvania Convention Center]] in 2011 of over {{convert|700000|sqft}} of meeting and convention space).

Visit Baltimore proposes an expansion of the convention center, reasoning that it would allow the city to accommodate multiple large meetings or conventions at a time.  Additionally, the Greater Baltimore Committee estimates that with the proposed arena-hotel-convention center, Baltimore could accommodate as many as 300 new convention groups that cannot utilize Baltimore currently due to the size of the convention center.

In fall 2010, the Greater Baltimore Committee, a local influential business group, proposed an estimated $900 million project that would demolish the 1979 wing of the Baltimore Convention Center east of Sharp Street, plus the Sheraton Inner Harbor Hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sheratoninnerharbor.com/ |title=Sheraton Inner Harbor Official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the same block, and replace the buildings with a four-story, {{convert|760,000|sqft}} convention center expansion, an 18,500 seat arena that will replace Baltimore's existing [[1st Mariner Arena]] over two levels of underground parking, a new 500-room Sheraton hotel and stores and restaurants facing Pratt, Charles and Conway Streets. At the time, the $900 million price tag was the only obstacle with the proposal.

However, on May 25, 2011, at the annual meeting for the Greater Baltimore Committee, the owner of the Sheraton Inner Harbor hotel, local business and construction magnate, Williard Hackerman, made an offer that he would be willing to finance more than half of the proposed $900 million price tag and would be willing to build the hotel and the arena which is estimated to cost $500 million and the remainder, $400 million for the convention center expansion would need to be financed by the State of Maryland and Baltimore City, the offer is contingent on whether the city and state can move the convention center expansion project forward. The offer received a positive reception from both Baltimore City Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley who both have submitted requests to the Maryland Stadium Authority to conduct a feasibility study on the project that is due by the end of 2011.

Visit Baltimore, the architects involved and others have said that this project is unique in that no other cities in the nation would have a combination arena-hotel-convention center the size of the proposed project in Baltimore.

On June 2, 2011, the Baltimore Sun reported that Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Governor Martin O'Malley wanted the Maryland Stadium Authority to pay for the estimated $150,000 feasibility study that will determine the "estimate of taxes that the project would generate" and if the study found the project to be viable, O'Malley and Rawlings-Blake wanted "an analysis of potential financing options and a strategy for moving the work forward."  On June 14, 2011, the MSA unanimously approved the feasibility request with a 7-0 vote; however, the MSA wanted the city of Baltimore to pay for part of the $150,000 cost for the feasibility study.

On July 18, 2011, the Baltimore Sun reported that the Baltimore Convention &amp; Tourism Board approved to take $50,000 out of Visit Baltimore's budget to pay for the $150,000 feasibility study that the Maryland Stadium Authority approved on June 14, 2011.

As of October 10, 2011, the Maryland Stadium Authority had posted on its website the feasibility study that was approved on June 14, 2011. The project is expected to include "a market and economic study of the convention center expansion and incremental tax benefits for all three venues, and a funding strategy." According to the MSA page, "The study is expected to be complete by winter [2011–2012]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdstad.com/content/view/105/143/ |title=Baltimore City Conference Center Expansion/Arena/Hotel |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2012, the feasibility report was published and made public jointly by the Maryland Stadium Authority and Baltimore City which strongly makes the recommendation for expanding the Baltimore Convention Center and replacing 1st Mariner Arena, reiterating that Baltimore's tourism industry will be harmed in the long run if no action is taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baltimorecity.gov/OfficeoftheMayor/NewsMedia/tabid/66/ID/2567/City_and_MSA_Release_Feasibility_Study_for_Proposed_Expansion_of_the_Baltimore_Convention_Center.aspx |title=City and MSA Release Feasibility Study for Proposed Expansion of the Baltimore Convention Center |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on April 11, 2012, the Baltimore Business Journal published an article stating that the Maryland General Assembly in approved $2.5 million for the convention center project allocated for "initial design [of the] $400 million expansion of the convention center (slated to be funded using public money from the State of Maryland and the City of Baltimore), as well as a $500 million, 18,500-seat arena and hotel project (slated to be funded using private funding from a group led by local business magnate Willard Hackerman)" however the Maryland General Assembly's budget committees added a prerequisite before they will approve the release of the $2.5 million.  The prerequisite required that the State of Maryland, the City of Baltimore and the private financiers of the project submit a memorandum of understanding to the Maryland General Assembly's budget committees with a detailed explanation of how this project would be funded, how much of the $400 million would be shared between the State of Maryland and the City of Baltimore and exactly who would operate the new arena. The proponent of this project and CEO of the Greater Baltimore Committee, Donald Fry, stated in an interview with the Baltimore Business Journal that the approval of initial design funds by the Maryland General Assembly gives the green light to both the Greater Baltimore Committee and Willard Hackerman to enter into serious negotiations with private investors regarding "naming rights or concession agreements for the arena" and he feels that this is a good sign that the Maryland General Assembly will, in fact, provide even more state funding towards this project in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2012/04/baltimore-convention-center-design.html |title=Baltimore Convention Center design money gets OK in legislature |accessdate=April 24, 2012 |first1=Jack |last1=Lambert |date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2012, Tom Noonan, President and CEO of [[Visit Baltimore]], voiced his support of this proposal. A series of studies would need to be conducted by the Maryland Stadium Authority to activate the $2.5 million and determine the feasibility and costs of the project. Construction, however, is not expected to begin until at least 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-arena-at-fifty-20121022,0,4954476,print.story |title=1st Mariner Arena turns 50 amid calls for its replacement.

In the Summer of 2013, the Greater Baltimore Committee proposal to build an expanded Baltimore Convention Center and a new arena came up in the Baltimore media due to the announcement that the largest event for Baltimore City, Otakon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2013/08/12/otakon-loss-we-have-three-years-to.html|title=Otakon loss: 'We have three years to fill it,' Noonan says|accessdate=January 20, 2014|date=August 14, 2013|last = Sullivan|first = Joanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be departing Baltimore in 2017 to Washington D.C. due to the convention quickly running out of room at the Baltimore Convention Center. According to The Baltimore Sun on August 11, 2013, the proposal "was not close to becoming a reality" and that according to GBC's spokesman Gene Bracken, financing for the proposal "hasn't been worked out at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/south-baltimore/bs-md-ci-otakon-moving-20130811,0,1080100,print.story|title=Otakon to move to D.C., citing aging convention center - Plans to expand the Baltimore Convention Center being studied|accessdate=January 20, 2014|date=August 11, 2013|last=Wells|first=Carrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 16, 2013, The Baltimore Sun reported that little progress has been made on the Greater Baltimore Committee's proposal, reporting that since April 2012, city and state officials have been negotiating with Willard Hackerman regarding exactly how to pay for the total $900 million projected amount for the proposal and that if the city, state and Mr. Hackerman can come up with a funding plan, the state will release $2.5 million "to pay for an expanded study of the project." The Baltimore Sun in the same article reported that the uncertainty surrounding the proposal to expand the Baltimore Convention Center "played a part in Otakon's departure" where Visit Baltimore "warned" a bid evaluating team for future Otakons "that construction could affect those events" however Visit Baltimore's CEO, Tom Noonan told The Baltimore Sun that "there's no set plan and that we're not near that point" in regards to potential construction and that a future study "will be to figure out how" the Baltimore Convention Center will "operate during construction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-baltimore-convention-center-20130816,0,7682832,print.story|title=Baltimore tourism business steady, but Otakon's exit points to future challenges - Proposed new arena and expanded convention center for Baltimore still lacks funding structure|accessdate=January 20, 2014|date=August 16, 2013|last=Korman|first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 12, 2013 WBAL reported that Donald Fry of the Greater Baltimore Committee told WBAL that he hoped that the GBC would be able to "present the mayor with some sort of financial concept within the next 30 to 60 days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/otakon-to-leave-baltimore-prompting-expansion-talk/-/10131532/21437832/-/pl67ls/-/index.html|title=Otakon to leave Baltimore, prompting expansion talk - Tourism officials examine options|accessdate=January 20, 2014|date=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2014, the Greater Baltimore Committee proposal to build an expanded convention Center and new arena hit a major roadblock: the owner of the Sheraton Inner Harbor and the person who was spearheading the efforts to raise private funds for the project, Willard Hackerman died. The Baltimore Business Journal reported on February 11, 2014, that the death of Willard Hackerman the day prior has thrown the future of the proposal into question. Kaliope Parthemos, Baltimore City's then-Deputy Mayor of Economic and Neighborhood Development told the Baltimore Business Journal that the City of Baltimore was in active discussions with Mr. Hackerman about the proposal up until December 2013 and stated that Mr. Hackerman was actively involved and wanted this proposal to move forward however he was "frustrated" that he could not have privately funded the entire cost by himself. Ms. Parthemos revealed that financing the estimated $900 million project "remained a significant hurdle up until Hackerman's death." Ms. Parthemos also stated that she was uncertain whether Mr. Hackerman made any plans to have the project continue after his death in case if he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2014/02/future-of-new-baltimore-arena-in.html|title=Future of new Baltimore arena in question after Hackerman's death|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=January 1, 2015|website=Baltimore Business Journal|last=Litten|first=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 27, 2015, no new news has been released regarding the uncertain future of the Greater Baltimore Committee proposal. It's currently unknown if the proposal will have political support after Martin O'Malley stepped down as Governor of Maryland due to term limits and Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced she would not be seeking reelection as Baltimore Mayor.

As of March 8, 2016, this proposal is dead and not expected to be revived because the Rawlings-Blake administration is looking into renovating Royal Farms Arena&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2016/03/02/city-weighs-royal-farms-arena-renovation-not-a.html|title=City weighs Royal Farms Arena renovation, not a replacement |website=Baltimore Business Journal|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of building a new arena. The State of Maryland has begun exploring the possibility of a $600 million expansion (see below).

===Proposed $600 million Baltimore Convention Center Expansion and New Hotel (2016)===
On March 8, 2016, it was revealed by the Baltimore Business Journal that the State of Maryland is exploring constructing a $600 million expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center that would double the existing floor space of the convention center and build a new hotel as well.

State officials are going to request in Spring 2016 from Governor Larry Hogan and the Maryland General Assembly $3 million in seed money to launch a study for expanding the convention center. This study will allow engineers and architects to figure out where to place the expansion.

Maryland's Commerce Secretary, Mike Gill said that the CEO of Visit Baltimore recently met with the Maryland Department of Commerce to request seed money to study the expansion of the convention center.

One possible location is demolishing the existing Sheraton Inner Harbor hotel and locating the expansion there and building the new hotel at the southwest corner of Pratt and Charles.

All of this is part of an ongoing discussion about expanding the Baltimore Convention Center which has been a focus of the current 2016 legislative session within the Maryland General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2016/03/600m-baltimore-convention-center-expansion-new.html?ana=e_bal_bn_breakingnews&amp;u=2Ysm2ErG05IyUfGKeJizhw0d07d1fe&amp;t=1457456321&amp;j=71209212|title=$600M Baltimore Convention Center expansion, new hotel being explored |website=Baltimore Business Journal|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new proposal by the State of Maryland and the focus of expanding the Baltimore Convention Center within the Maryland General Assembly comes about in the final year [2016] that Baltimore's largest convention, Otakon, will be held in Baltimore. In 2017, Otakon will no longer be held in Baltimore and is relocating to Washington D.C. at the larger Walter E. Washington Convention Center.

As of 12:00 AM EDT, April 12, 2016, the official end of the 2016 Maryland legislative session within the Maryland General Assembly, no bill was introduced in either the state Senate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/pubs-current/current-Senate-status-report.pdf|title=Status of All Maryland Senate Legislation Introduced 2016 Session As of 2:33 PM on 4/12/2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or House of Delegates&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/pubs-current/current-house-status-report.pdf|title=Status of All Maryland House Legislation Introduced 2016 Session As of 2:36 PM on 4/12/2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that requested the $3 million in seed money to launch a study for expanding the Baltimore Convention Center. It's currently unknown why no bill was introduced in the 2016 legislative session when it was reported in March 2016 that there would be a request for $3 million, it's unknown if the request will be made within the 2017 Maryland legislative session that will begin on Wednesday, January 11, 2017, at 12:00 PM EST.

On Thursday, April 14, 2016, the ''Baltimore Business Journal'' reported that the $3 million for a study to expand the Baltimore Convention Center was supposed to be part of one of three supplemental budgets that the Maryland Governor has but according to Karen Glen Hood, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of Commerce told the Baltimore Business Journal that a formal request for $3 million was never submitted to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and did not explain why the request was not made, instead deferring the question of why to local officials closer to the Baltimore Convention Center.

Visit Baltimore CEO Tom Noonan, a longtime advocate for expanding the Baltimore Convention Center stated he was "disappointed" that the funding wasn't in place at the end of the 2016 Maryland legislative session, the executive director of the convention center, Peggy Daidakis could not have been reached for comment.

Maryland's Secretary of Commerce, Mike Gill, told the Baltimore Business Journal that the interested parties in having the Baltimore Convention Center expanded are having "ongoing conversations" into what the next steps for a study would be but stated he couldn't state specifics.

Visit Baltimore's CEO Noonan revealed that at least 30% of interested citywide conventions, conventions defined as requiring at least 1,200 hotel rooms at its peak night, skip over Baltimore for other cities due to the convention center being either too small or is already booked on the dates the interested conventions want reserved in Baltimore.

The Baltimore Business Journal reports that when the Baltimore Convention Center opened in 1979, it was "one of the premier convention spaces in the country" but the stature of the convention center has fallen over time with upgrades to other convention centers in cities such as Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and Atlanta.

Now, as of April 14, 2016, the interested parties for an expanded convention center will either have to wait until 2017's legislative session or search for alternative funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2016/04/funding-for-baltimore-convention-center-expansion.html|title=Funding for Baltimore Convention Center expansion study stalls |website=Baltimore Business Journal|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2, 2016, the proposed project of constructing an expanded convention center attached to a new arena and hotel has been revived and a $1 million feasibility study has in fact been approved (see below).

===Second proposed arena-hotel-convention center project (2016–2017)===
On August 2, 2016, it's been revealed that the proposed project of constructing a combined expanded convention center attached to an arena and hotel has been revived and that a $1 million feasibility study for a combined arena, hotel and expanded convention center was requested by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake from the Maryland Stadium Authority and that the Maryland Stadium Authority has approved the study. Funding is coming from the Maryland Stadium Authority ($126,667), the State of Maryland (an additional $500,000 is available immediately to fund this study), the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore ($30,000), the Greater Baltimore Committee ($30,000), and the City of Baltimore ($313,333). The study will take approximately a year to complete and is expected to be completed and released in Fall 2017. The study will look at having either just a convention center expansion and having a combined expanded convention center attached to a new arena and hotel, the study will look at the environmental, community and traffic impacts of the two proposals and what types of events the new facility will be able to attract, this study will also determine exactly how large the expanded convention center is supposed to be. The new complex will be bounded by Pratt, Charles and Conway Streets. This study will not include construction and budget plans as this is just Phase 1, if the state and city elects to move forward after reviewing the results of this study, that second study will put together just partial plans to obtain a cost estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2016/08/02/baltimore-convention-center-expansion-new-arena.html|title=Baltimore Convention Center expansion, new arena and hotel will again be explored |work=Baltimore Business Journal|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, the Maryland Stadium Authority's feasibility study that was approved in August 2016 got full funding after the Baltimore City Board of Estimates approved to commit to $313,000 of funding towards the $1 million feasibility study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2016/11/23/1m-study-of-baltimore-convention-center-expansion.html|title=$1M study of Baltimore Convention Center expansion gets OK from city spending board |newspaper=Baltimore Business Journal|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes approximately a week after the Baltimore Development Corp., the city's economic development agency's board approved to commit to $250,000 of funding towards the $1 million feasibility study (the remainder of the study costs are being funded through the state and two private groups: $126,667 from the Maryland Stadium Authority, $500,000 from the Maryland Department of Commerce with a total of $626,667 coming from the State of Maryland and $30,000 each from local groups the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore and the Greater Baltimore Committee). Jeff Pilas, the CFO of the Baltimore Development Corp. told the Baltimore Business Journal that if the study recommends an expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center, a second phase for the study would commence involving design.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2016/11/17/bdc-approves-250k-toward-baltimore-convention.html|title=BDC approves $250K toward Baltimore Convention Center expansion study |newspaper=Baltimore Business Journal|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was requested by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and is expected to begin sometime in early 2017 and final completion is expected to be sometime later in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In April 2017, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, the successor to former Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, stated that she does not agree with building a hotel as part of an expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://baltimorebrew.com/2017/04/25/exclusive-city-to-restructure-hilton-hotel-debt-to-shore-up-its-finances/|title=Exclusive: City to restructure Hilton Hotel debt to shore up its finances|website=Baltimore Brew|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 2017, the Baltimore Sun has reported that Phase 1 of the Baltimore Convention Center expansion feasibility study is moving along. On May 3, 2017, the Maryland Stadium Authority approved a team for the study that includes Baltimore design firm Ayers Saint Gross, Seattle architectural firm LMN Architects, Kansas City firm Populous, and New York design firm Perkins Eastman. The Baltimore Sun reports that the study amount has significantly decreased from the amount being "up to $1 million" to now the study total costs is "not to exceed $460,000." The study is to "assess what combination of elements is feasible — a convention center expansion, hotel and new venue to replace Royal Farms Arena — and how they might fit together." and is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. Funding for the $460,000 is still coming from public and private sources including Baltimore City and the State of Maryland. Based upon the final recommendations of this study, the Baltimore Sun reports that a Phase 2 study "may be authorized later."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-bz-convention-center-study-20170504-story.html|title=Team named to study convention center expansion, possible new arena|last=Barker|first=Jeff|work=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2017, Phase 1 of the Baltimore Convention Center expansion study is underway. According to an LMN Architects press release, the study will be examining 4 "alternative development options":

The official study summary according to the Maryland Stadium Authority is:&lt;blockquote&gt;MSA's Board has approved a request by the Mayor of Baltimore to conduct various program and construction related analysis to determine the program and technical feasibility for a proposed Baltimore Convention Center expansion. The Study will consider both a stand-alone convention center as well as a hybrid facility inclusive of a hotel and/or arena.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Funding is being provided by a mix of public, private, City and State dollars.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The&amp;nbsp;MSA also lists the budget to be $1 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mdstad.com/studies/analysis-expansion-baltimore-city-convention-center-2016|title=Analysis of Expansion of Baltimore City Convention Center (2016) {{!}} Maryland Stadium Authority|website=mdstad.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

As of February 26, 2018, the Phase 1 feasibility study has not been released publicly yet nor has a study recommendation been released publicly, both were reported to be released by the end of 2017 and it's unknown what is causing the delay for releasing the Phase 1 study or the study recommendation. 

==Location==
The Baltimore Convention Center is located within a superblock bounded by Charles Street, Pratt Street, Conway Street, and Howard Streets.  The east and west halves of the Baltimore Convention Center are linked by an enclosed skywalk bridge over Sharp Street. The total land area of the Baltimore Convention Center is {{convert|608,968|sqft|m2}}, or {{convert|13.980|acre|m2}} and the total enclosed area is {{convert|400,000|sqft|m2}}. The structural engineers for the expansion of this project was Leslie E. Robertson Associates.

The west end of the facility—corner of Pratt and Howard Street—is served by the [[Convention Center (Baltimore Light Rail station)|Convention Center/Pratt Street Station]] of the [[Maryland Transit Administration]]'s [[Baltimore Light Rail|light rail]] system, providing direct links to both [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport|BWI Airport]] and [[Baltimore Penn Station]] (MARC [[Penn Line (MARC)|Penn Line]] and [[Amtrak]] [[Northeast Corridor]] trains).  A major Maryland Transit Administration bus stop is located at the intersection of Pratt &amp; Sharp Streets in front of the Baltimore Convention Center, near the western half of the Baltimore Convention Center (Pratt Street Entrance).  The [[Camden Yards Light Rail Stop]] and [[Camden Line]] (MARC) station are also within walking distance of the facility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2055">'''Björn Gustaf Prytz''' (2 April 1887 – 22 June 1976) was a Swedish industrialist in the early 1900s and from 1937 to 1947 an [[Envoy (title)|envoy]] in London for the Swedish government.

He was employed 1913 at [[SKF|S.K.F.]] as marketing manager. He became managing director for S.K.F. around 1921–22. Björn Prytz was the man behind the name [[Volvo]] during the time he was the managing director for SKF sales company in America 1914–18. Volvo was registered as a trademark, as well as a subsidiary company to SKF, in May 1915 (the application for Volvo as a trademark was sent to [[Swedish Patent and Registration Office|PRV]] on May 11), with the intention to use it for a new developed low-price ball bearing for the automobile industry in the America. However, these plans were never realized and the SKF name and logotype (as it looks today) was used instead for all type of bearings produced by SKF. The name and company Volvo was almost forgotten but came into use when the SKF employee [[Assar Gabrielsson]] (SKF sales manager) and engineer [[Gustav Larson]] finally had succeeded to convince SKF that they should start to manufacture automobiles within SKF. AB Volvo, as an automobile company, was founded 10 August 1926 at a board meeting held in [[Hofors]] when SKF decided to invest in the company and use it as a subsidiary company within the SKF-group.

His name is appearing in reference to a mysterious meeting which he had in June 1940 with the British Foreign Office Minister [[Rab Butler]], at which the possibility of Britain making a compromise peace was discussed.

'''Bound to Rise: Radical Ideas For The New Corporate World''', the second book by Indian author and communications expert Sunil Robert, is a guide to young entrants to the corporate world. It is a part memoir, and part self-help book advising young executives on how to deal with the high stress and constant pressure of the corporate environment, and find fulfilment. The author delves into his personal experiences in the corporate world, spanning 25 years and covering [[India]], [[UK]] and the [[US]] and uses philosophical metaphors to explain the necessity of accepting change by adjusting our mindsets to embrace change.

The book is split into chapters that follow a style of following the progress of an individual from one role to another, the former emphasizing a ‘reactive’ person and the latter emphasizing a ‘responsive’ one. These shifts are explained through anecdotes, philosophy, observations and narration.

Sunil is a global executive with a career spanning 25 years across India, Europe and North America.

In the late 19th century a '''captain of industry''' was a business leader whose means of amassing a personal fortune contributed positively to the country in some way. This may have been through increased productivity, expansion of markets, providing more jobs, or acts of [[philanthropy]].&lt;ref&gt;Scranton, Philip. [http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24287 "Fine Line Between Thief and Entrepreneur"]. Teachinghistory.org. Retrieved 12 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation contrasts with that of the [[robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]], a business leader using political means to achieve personal ends.

==Versus "robber baron"==

Some 19th-century industrialists who were called "captains of industry" overlap with those called "[[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]]". These include people such as [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Andrew W. Mellon]], [[Henry Ford]], and [[John D. Rockefeller]]. The term was coined by [[Thomas Carlyle]] in his 1843 book, ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]''.

The education division of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] has prepared a lesson plan for schools asking whether "robber baron" or "captain of industry" is the better terminology. The lesson states that it attempts to help students "establish a distinction between robber barons and captains of industry. Students will uncover some of the less honorable deeds as well as the shrewd business moves and highly charitable acts of the great industrialists and financiers. It has been argued that only because such people were able to amass great amounts of capital could our country become the world's greatest industrial power. Some of the actions of these men, which could only happen in a period of economic [[laissez faire]], resulted in poor conditions for workers, but in the end, may also have enabled our present day standard of living."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/industrial-age-america-robber-barons-and-captains-industry#sect-preparation "The Industrial Age in America: Robber Barons and Captains of Industry" ''EDSITEment!

{{Business administration}}
In economics, a '''commodity''' is an economic good or service that has full or substantial [[fungibility]]: that is, the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/commodities/f/whatcommodities.htm|title=Learn What Commodities Are in These Examples!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commodities are [[raw material]]s, basic resources, [[agriculture|agricultural]], or [[mining]] products, such as [[iron ore]], [[sugar]], or [[grain|grains]] like [[rice]] and [[wheat]]. Commodities can also be mass-produced unspecialized products such as [[chemical substance|chemicals]] and [[computer memory]].

The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole: well-established physical commodities have actively traded [[spot market|spot]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] markets. The wide availability of commodities typically leads to smaller [[profit margin|profit margins]] and diminishes the importance of factors (such as [[brand|brand name]]) other than price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commodity definition |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commodity |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''commodity'' came into use in English in the 15th century, from the French ''[[:wikt:commodité#French|commodité]]'', "amenity, convenience". Going further back, the French word derives from the Latin ''[[:wikt:commoditas#Latin|commoditas]]'', meaning "suitability, convenience, advantage". The Latin word ''[[:wikt:commodus#Latin|commodus]]'' (from which English gets other words including ''commodious'' and ''accommodate'') meant variously "appropriate", "proper measure, time, or condition", and "advantage, benefit".

== Characteristics ==
In economics, the term ''commodity'' is used specifically for economic goods or services that have full or partial but substantial [[fungibility]]; that is, the market treats their instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/commodities/f/whatcommodities.htm|title=Learn What Commodities Are in These Examples!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx described this property as follows: "From the taste of [[wheat]], it is not possible to tell who produced it, a [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serf]], a French peasant or an English [[capitalist]]."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petroleum]] and [[copper]] are examples of commodity goods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |author2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in action |publisher=Pearson / Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; their supply and demand are a part of one universal market.

Non-commodity items such as [[stereo]] systems have many aspects of product differentiation, such as the [[brand]], the user interface and the perceived quality. The demand for one type of stereo may be much larger than demand for another.

The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole. Well-established physical commodities have actively traded [[spot market|spot]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] markets.

== Hard and soft commodities ==
[[Soft commodity|Soft commodities]] are goods that are grown, such as [[wheat]], or [[rice]].

Hard commodities are [[mining|mined]]. Examples include [[gold]], [[helium]], and [[petroleum|oil]].

Energy commodities include electricity, gas, [[coal]] and oil. Electricity has the particular characteristic that it is usually uneconomical to store, and must therefore be consumed as soon as it is processed.

== Commoditization ==
[[Commoditization]] occurs as a goods or services market loses differentiation across its supply base, often by the diffusion of the [[intellectual capital]] necessary to acquire or produce it efficiently. As such, goods that formerly carried premium [[Profit margin|margins]] for [[Market (economics)|market]] [[wikt:participation|participants]] have become commodities, such as [[Generic drug|generic pharmaceuticals]] and [[dynamic random-access memory|DRAM chips]]. An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' cites [[multivitamin]] supplements as an example of commoditization; a 50&amp;nbsp;mg tablet of [[calcium]] is of equal value to a consumer no matter what company produces and markets it, and as such, multivitamins are now sold in bulk and are available at any supermarket with little brand differentiation.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Natasha Singer |author2=Peter Lattman |title=Workout Supplement Challenged |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/business/a-soldiers-parents-take-aim-at-gnc-and-a-supplement-maker.html?hpw&amp;pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this trend, [[nanomaterials]] are emerging from carrying premium profit margins for market participants to a status of commodification.&lt;ref&gt;C. McGovern, ″Commoditization of nanomaterials″. ''Nanotechnology Perceptions'' '''6''' (2010) 155–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a spectrum of commoditization, rather than a binary distinction of "commodity versus differentiable product". Few products have complete undifferentiability and hence fungibility; even electricity can be differentiated in the market based on its method of generation (e.g., fossil fuel, wind, solar), in markets where [[electricity market#Retail electricity market|energy choice]] lets a buyer opt (and pay more) for renewable methods if desired. Many products' degree of commoditization depends on the buyer's mentality and means. For example, milk, eggs, and notebook paper are not differentiated by many customers; for them, the product is fungible and lowest price is the main decisive factor in the purchasing choice. Other customers take into consideration other factors besides price, such as environmental sustainability and animal welfare. To these customers, distinctions such as "[[Organic food|organic]] versus not" or "[[Free-range eggs|cage free]] versus not" count toward differentiating brands of milk or eggs, and percentage of recycled content or [[Forest Stewardship Council]] [[Certified wood|certification]] count toward differentiating brands of notebook paper.

==Commodity trade==
{{Main article|Futures exchange|Commodity market}}
In the original and simplified sense, '''''commodities''''' were things of value, of uniform quality, that were produced in large quantities by many different producers; the items from each different producer were considered equivalent. On a commodity exchange, it is the underlying standard stated in the contract that defines the commodity, not any quality inherent in a specific producer's product.

[[Commodities exchange]]s include:&lt;!-- New links in alphabetical order please --&gt;

[[Commodity market|Markets for trading commodities]] can be very [[economic efficiency|efficient]], particularly if the division into pools matches demand [[market segmentation|segments]]. These markets will quickly respond to changes in [[supply and demand]] to find an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] [[price]] and quantity. In addition, investors can gain passive exposure to the commodity markets through a [[commodity price index]].

In order to [[Diversification (finance)|diversify]] their investments and mitigate the risks associated with [[inflation]]ary debasement of currencies, [[pension fund]]s and [[sovereign wealth fund]]s allocate capital to non-listed assets such as a commodities and commodity-related infrastructure.&lt;ref name="turkishweekly"&gt;{{Cite news |author=M.

== Inventory data ==
The [[inventory]] of commodities, with low inventories typically leading to more volatile future prices and increasing the risk of a "[[stockout]]" (inventory exhaustion). According to economist theorists, companies receive a [[convenience yield]] by holding inventories of certain commodities. Data on inventories of commodities are not available from one common source, although data is available from various sources. Inventory data on 31 commodities was used in a 2006 study on the relationship between inventories and commodity futures risk premiums.&lt;ref&gt;Gorton GB et al. (2008). [http://ssrn.com/abstract=996930 The Fundamentals of Commodity Futures Returns]. Yale ICF Working Paper No. 07-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commodification of labor==
{{See also|Labour is not a commodity}}

In classical political economy and especially in [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of political economy, a commodity is an object or a good or service ("product" or "activity"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt;) produced by [[labour power|human labour]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'' (International Publishers: New York, 1967) p. 38 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'' (International Publishers: New York, 1996) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Objects are external to man.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', p. 87 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some objects attain "[[use value]]" to persons in this world, when they are found to be "necessary, useful or pleasant in life,"&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politica'' (Oxford, 1966) p. 1257.&lt;/ref&gt; "Use value" makes an object "an object of human wants,"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital in General: The Commodity" contained in the ''Collected works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'' (International Publishers: New York, 1987) p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; or is "a means of subsistence in the widest sense."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital in General: The Commodity" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

As society developed, people found that they could trade goods and services for other goods and services. At this stage, these goods and services became "commodities." Commodities are defined as objects which are offered for sale or are "exchanged in a market."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'' p. 36 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the marketplace, where commodities are sold, "use value" is not helpful in facilitating the sale of commodities. Accordingly, in addition to having use value, commodities must have an "exchange value"—a value that could be expressed in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (Pelican Books: London, 1970) p. 131 and David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books: 1971, London) p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Marx, many economists debated as to what elements made up exchange value. [[Adam Smith]] maintained that exchange value was made up of [[economic rent|rent]], [[economic profit|profit]], [[labor economics|labour]] and the costs of wear and tear on the instruments of husbandry.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (Pelican Books: London, 1970) p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ricardo]], a follower of Adam Smith, modified Smith's approach on this point by alleging that labour alone is the content of the exchange value of any good or service.&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books: London, 1971) pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; While maintaining that all exchange value in commodities was derived directly from the hands of the people that made the commodity, Ricardo noted that only part of the exchange value of the commodity was paid to the worker who made the commodity. The other part of the value of this particular commodity was labour that was not paid to the worker—unpaid labour. This unpaid labour was retained by the owner of the means of production. In capitalist society, the capitalist owns the means of production and therefore the unpaid labour is retained by the capitalist as rent or as profit. The means of production means the site where the commodity is made, the raw products that are used in the production and the instruments or machines that are used for the production of the commodity.

However, not all commodities are reproducible nor were all commodities originally intended to be sold in the market. These priced goods are also treated as commodities, e.g. human labour-power, works of art and natural resources ("earth itself is an instrument of labour"),&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 179 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; even though they may not be produced specifically for the market, or be non-reproducible goods.

Marx's analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of goods, using the [[labour theory of value|labor theory of value]]. This problem was extensively debated by [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]]&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books, London, 1971) pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow]] among others.

All three of the above-mentioned economists rejected the theory that labour composed 100% of the exchange value of any commodity. In varying degrees, these economists turned to supply and demand to establish the price of commodities. Marx held that the "price" and the "value" of a commodity were not synonymous. Price of any commodity would vary according to the imbalance of supply to demand at any one period of time. The "value" of the same commodity would be consistent and would reflect the amount of labour value used to produce that commodity.

Prior to Marx, economists noted that the problem with using the "quantity of labour" to establish the value of commodities was that the time spent by an unskilled worker would be longer than the time spent on the same commodity by a skilled worker. Thus, under this analysis, the commodity produced by an unskilled worker would be more valuable than the same commodity produced by the skilled worker. Marx pointed out, however, that in society at large, an average amount of time that was necessary to produce the commodity would arise. This average time necessary to produce the commodity Marx called the "socially necessary labour time"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 39 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Socially necessary labour time was the proper basis on which to base the "exchange value" of a given commodity.

Value and price are not equivalent terms in economics, and theorising the specific relationship of value to market price has been a challenge for both liberal and Marxist economists. However, Marx held that the value and price of any commodity would coincide only when demand and supply were equivalent to each other.

[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|right|360px|Expansion of U.S. copyright term (Assuming authors create their works at age 35 and live for 70 years)]]
'''Copyright term''' is the length of time [[copyright]] subsists in a work before it passes into the [[public domain]].

==Length of copyright==
Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. [[musical composition]] or [[novel]]), whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. In most countries (for example, the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|305}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations |date=1995|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm |title=Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;) copyright expires at the end of the calendar year in question.

The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the copyright duration in a given country difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately six years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes [[Ex post facto law|retroactively]]). International treaties, like the [[Berne Convention]], establish minimum terms for copyrights, but these only apply to the signatory countries, and individual countries may grant longer terms than those set out in a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA |last=Nimmer |first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International |year=2003 |isbn=978-90-411-8876-2 |oclc=50606064 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
===Copyright term and the public domain===
The extension of copyright term, imposes tangible restrictions on the [[public domain]]. For instance, scholar Neil Netanel argued that [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] 1998 prevented the entering of works central to [[Culture of the United States|cultural heritage of the US]] into the public domain. He argued, culturally important dissemination, recasting, or incorporation into new expression is prevented due "to the copyright holder's veto". As examples he gave the adaption of the plot from novels such as [[The Great Gatsby]] and [[Peter Pan]], the refashion of characters like [[Mickey Mouse]], or the use of [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs like "[[Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)]]" for documentaries about the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=nethanel&gt;{{Cite book| last = Netanel| first = Neil| title = Copyright’s paradox| publisher = Oxford University Press US| date = 2008| pages = 200| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=vo9G-0iZNQIC&amp;dq=orphan+works&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780195137620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright term and orphan works===
For the millions of older copyrighted works of less enduring popularity, it is difficult, or impossible, to trace the copyright ownership and determine who holds the particular rights that would have to be licensed for the use of the work. The problem of such [[orphan works]] stems from the extension of copyright term and the lack of requirement for the copyright owner to renew or [[Copyright registration|register their copyright]].&lt;ref name=nethanel/&gt; In order to tackle this perceived problem some jurisdictions have [[Copyright reform|revised their copyright laws]] to allow use of orphaned works, after diligent searches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/chapter/III/crossheading/orphan-works] Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988, s44B&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and discussion==
Discussions about the optimal length of the copyright term (e.g. regarding the copyrights incentive for creative production&lt;ref name="petra moser"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130214025845/http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/mdocs/en/wipo_ip_econ_ge_5_12/wipo_ip_econ_ge_5_12_ref_moser.pdf DEAD POETS’ PROPERTY - THE COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1814 AND THE PRICE OF LITERATURE IN THE ROMANTIC PERIOD] XING LI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY, MEGAN MACGARVIE, BOSTON UNIVERSITY AND NBER, AND PETRA MOSER, STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND NBER (NOVEMBER 14, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;) is a significant part of public and scientific discourse and reception.&lt;ref name="JASSS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/15868004 Copyright and wrong - Why the rules on copyright need to return to their roots] on [[The Economist]] ''"The notion that lengthening copyright increases creativity is questionable, however. Authors and artists do not generally consult the statute books before deciding whether or not to pick up pen or paintbrush. And overlong copyrights often limit, rather than encourage, a work's dissemination, impact and influence."'' (Apr 8th 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2012/09/do-patent-and-copyright-law-restrict-competition-and-creativity-excessively-posner.html Do patent and copyright law restrict competition and creativity excessively?] on [[University of Chicago Law School]] by Becker &amp; Posner ''"I am concerned that both patent and copyright protection, though particularly the former, may be excessive."''

If anything, patents inhibit innovation. |publisher=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earlier and often cited positions is from the British politician [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] who argued in an 1841 speech in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that copyright is a [[monopoly]] and as such has generally negative effects on society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/commentary/MacaulaySpeeches.html MacaulaySpeeches] on law.asu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepublicdomain.org/2014/07/24/macaulay-on-copyright/ macaulay-on-copyright] on thepublicdomain.org&lt;/ref&gt; Although Macaulay's speech is widely reported, the reaction to it in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is hard to find – Ricketson reports that following Macaulay's claims that the heirs of certain authors would block publication of their works:

:"At this point, the debate in the House of Commons fell into farce because there were claims by other speakers that they had no doubts (based on their own personal knowledge) that Richardson and Boswell's descendants would still have done the right thing and allowed reprinting, however much they abhorred their ancestors' works!"&lt;ref&gt;Sam Ricketson, The copyright term, International Review of Intellectual Property and Competition Law (1992), 753, p767.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also worth noting that Macaulay is arguing here against term extension, he is not arguing against copyright. This point is well made by Macaulay himself:

:"The advantages arising from a system of copyright are obvious. It is desirable that we should have a supply of good books: we cannot have such a supply unless men of letters are liberally remunerated; and the least objectionable way of remunerating them is by means of copyright."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Babington Macaulay, Speeches of Lord Macaulay, Longman, Green, Longman and Roberts, 1860, p232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liebowitz describes use of the term monopoly in relation to copyright as misleading, but "rhetorically effective".&lt;ref&gt;Stan Liebowitz, A critique of copyright criticism, George Mason Law Review, vol 22:4:943 (2015), p958.&lt;/ref&gt; While Towse writes that a more appropriate term is '[[monopolistic competition]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Towse, Copyright, risk and the artist: an economic approach to policy for artists, International Journal of Cultural Policy, 6:1:91 (1999), p105, note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a paper by [[Rufus Pollock]] of [[University of Cambridge]] scientifically quantified the optimal copyright term length at 15 years, significantly shorter than any currently existing copyright term, via an economical model with [[U-statistic|empirically-estimable parameter]]s.&lt;ref name="HoEoC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=2013-02-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221124708/http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_over_time.pdf |url=http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |title=OPTIMAL COPYRIGHT OVER TIME: TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND THE STOCK OF WORKS |first=Rufus |last=Pollock |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |date=2007-10-01 |accessdate=2015-01-11 |authorlink=Rufus Pollock |quote=''The optimal level for copyright has been a matter for extensive debate over the last decade. Using a parsimonious theoretical model this paper contributes several new results of relevance to this debate. In particular we demonstrate that (a) optimal copyright is likely to fall as the production costs of `originals' decline (for example as a result of digitization) (b) technological change which reduces costs of production may imply a decrease or a decrease in optimal levels of protection (this contrasts with a large number of commentators, particularly in the copyright industries, who have argued that such change necessitates increases in protection) (c) the optimal level of copyright will, in general, fall over time as the stock of work increases.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=2013-01-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112152530/http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |url=http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |title=FOREVER MINUS A DAY?

Based on a novel approach we derive an explicit formula which characterises the optimal term as a function of a few key and, most importantly, empirically-estimable parameters. Using existing data on recordings and books we obtain a point estimate of around 15 years for optimal copyright term with a 99% confidence interval extending up to 38 years. This is substantially shorter than any current copyright term and implies that existing terms are too long.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 scholar Petra Moser concluded in a paper on the impact of the copyright extension on the British [[Copyright Act 1814|Copyright Act of 1814]] that "longer copyrights raise the costs of accessing intellectual assets for consumers and other firms, which may discourage the diffusion of knowledge and decelerate the pace of cumulative innovation and [[Learning-by-doing (economics)|learning-by-doing]]."&lt;ref name="petra moser"/&gt;

In 2014 a [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] article about the existence of [[Orphaned works|orphaned]] classical [[video game]]s and the suggestion of letting them enter the public domain after 20 years, raised a controversial public debate about copyright terms and public domain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/29/gogs-time-machine-sale-lets-you-control-time-itself/ |title=GOG’s Time Machine Sale Lets You CONTROL TIME ITSELF |first=John |last=Walker |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |quote=''As someone who desperately pines for the PD model that drove creativity before the copyright industry malevolently took over the planet, it saddens my heart that a game two decades old isn’t released into the world.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/02/03/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain/ |title=Editorial: Why Games Should Enter The Public Domain |first=John |last=Walker |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |quote=''games more than a couple of decades old aren’t entering the public domain.

John Walker argues that perhaps a good cutoff would be 20 years before an "idea" enters the public domain."'' (February 03, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2015 published [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] paper, analysed with a simulated model the relationship of scientific knowledge creation to copyright term length and concluded a decreased knowledge production on copyright term increases for the analysed context.&lt;ref name="JASSS"&gt;[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/18/2/23.html Does Longer Copyright Protection Help or Hurt Scientific Knowledge Creation?] [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] 18 (2) 23 DOI: 10.18564/jasss.2720 ''"The prevailing trend in most simulations was that increasing the copyright term resulted decreased knowledge production."'' (31-Mar-2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a curiosity, the work ''[[Peter and Wendy#Copyright status|Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' is subject in the UK to a special clause in the [[Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988]]&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 s301 and schedule 6.&lt;/ref&gt; that granted [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] a right to royalty in perpetuity. [[J M Barrie]] had gifted the copyright to the work to the hospital in 1929. The different copyright terms in the various jurisdictions has led to some disputes involving derivative works created and/or sold elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/cases/emily_somma_v_gosh_peter_.shtml  |title=Stanford Center for Internet and Society |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2010-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061027134508/http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/cases/emily_somma_v_gosh_peter_.shtml |archivedate = 2006-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known for working newly released prisoners as [[Gum-digger|gum diggers]] and trading the gum for a profit.&lt;ref name=Waitakere&gt;[http://www.waitakere.govt.nz/AbtCit/ei/pdfs/urbanstudies/donbuck.pdf Waitakere History]&lt;/ref&gt; He is seen as a mixed figure; this is mostly because of the perceived conflict between his profiteering and his making use of criminals and ex-criminals.

==Biography==
Little is known of Don Buck's early life.

He tried various business, all of which failed, before moving out to [[Henderson, New Zealand]], in 1911, when he started gum-digging at the recommendation of some locals;&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt; Kauri gum was at that time experiencing considerable prospecting attention in [[New Zealand]], of which it became an important product for a short time. From there, he moved out near Swanson Stream and built his abode on some likely prospecting land.&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt; There, he found an abundance of gum, but was not able to do the work to remove it himself, due to a heart condition. He persuaded the Police Magistrates in the [[Auckland]] Courts, that they should give convicted criminals the option of working at his camp, or serving a sentence in jail.&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt; Alongside this, multiple ex-prisoners without any prospects were sent to him.

On top of gaining a profit from selling the gum, he made gain by renting out shacks to prospectors.&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt;

Don Buck did not supply alcohol (he himself did not drink, again due to his heart condition), but drunkenness was not rare at his camp, since there were several near-by vineyards.&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt; During one drunken bout in the camp, a murder was reported to have happened. The police did not take the much interest in the matter, and after it was found that the victim had drunk large amounts of alcohol prior to his death, the case became stagnant.&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt;

Don Buck died suddenly on 5 August 1917, one day after suffering a [[heart attack]].&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt; He was buried in a [[pauper]]'s grave in Waikumete Cemetery, originally with an un-marked or poorly marked grave. The grave has since been marked with a gravestone as a result of a campaign and financing by local historian Marianne Simpkins.

==Commemoration==
Don Buck Road in [[Massey, New Zealand]] is named after him.

The Huruhuru Stream (also known as the Swanson Stream) is known locally as Don Buck Creek from Don Buck Road down to where the Northwestern Motorway crosses it.

Don Buck Primary School, which is located part way along Don Buck Road, is also named in his honour: http://www.donbuck.school.nz/

Bertarelli has a BSc from [[Boston University]]’s College of Communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialwealthmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=191:er|title=Ernesto Bertarelli, Private Equity Fund Hot Player|publisher=Financial Wealth|accessdate=1 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130410195553/http://www.financialwealthmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=191:er|archivedate=10 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Bertarelli was active in Serono, the family business, and from 1992 to 1997 was Executive Director, Public and Professional Affairs, where she established [http://www.seronosymposia.org Serono Symposia] and the Serono Foundation. The company was sold to [[Merck KGaA]] at the beginning of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merck.de/en/investors/ad_hoc_announcements/acquisition_of_serono/acquisition_of_serono.html The Merck Group - Acquisition of Serono S.A&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522023025/http://www.merck.de/en/investors/ad_hoc_announcements/acquisition_of_serono/acquisition_of_serono.html |date=22 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five star Grand Hôtel Park in [[Gstaad]]  was taken over by Bertarelli in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bilanz.ch/people/gstaad-gold-am-berg|title=Gstaad: gold on the mountain (translation)|publisher=Bilanz|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
After her father died, in 1999 Bertarelli and her brother founded the Bertarelli Foundation to promote the sharing and development of scientific, social and economic knowledge in the field of infertility. For ten years, Bertarelli was Chairman of the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hebdo.ch/ernesto_bertarelli_le_roi_midas_24480_.html|title=Gstaad: Ernesto Bertarelli King Midas(translation)|publisher=Le'Hebdo|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertarelli is an ambassador for the Swiss transfusion charity Ma Vie Ton Sang &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mavietonsang.ch/donneurs/evenements/ambassadeurs |title=Ambassadeurs &amp;#124; MaVieTonSang |language=fr |publisher=Mavietonsang.ch |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a supporter of the World Health Organization’s ‘Go Red for Women’ campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/03/idUS72069+03-Feb-2010+BW20100203 |title=Three Year Partnership between Go Red for Women and Dona Bertarelli`s Ladycat Enables Campaign to Grow by 56% |publisher=Reuters |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a godmother to the Womanity charity (formerly Smiling Children).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Par Stéphane Benoit-Godet |url=http://www.bilan.ch/argent-finances-exclusif/comment-les-bertarelli-structurent-leur-action |title=Comment les Bertarelli structurent leur action - Argent &amp; finances, Les plus de la rédaction - Bilan |language=fr |publisher=Bilan.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sailing==
Bertarelli is an avid sailor and since 2007 has raced with her team, Spindrift Racing, in the monotype multihull regattas on Lake Léman with her Décision 35 [[catamaran]], ''Ladycat''. Bertarelli and her team won the Bol d’Or Mirabaud in 2010.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Bertarelli was the first helmswoman to win this race since its inception in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boldor.ch/boldor/ch/en-ch/index.cfm?page=/boldor/home/regate/histoire Bol d'Or Mirabaud - History of the regatta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bilan.ch/articles/finance/comment-les-bertarelli-structurent-leur-action|title=How Bertarelli structure their action|publisher=Bilan|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Bertarelli bought a Maxi Trimaran called ''Maxi [[Banque Populaire V]]'' for her Spindrift racing team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pontoon.es/2013/01/31/dona-bertarelli-acquires-maxi-banque-populaire-v-legendary-trimaran-and-winner-of-the-trophee-jules-verne/ |title=Dona Bertarelli acquires Maxi Banque Populaire V, legendary trimaran and winner of the Trophée Jules Verne. &amp;#124; PONTOON |publisher=Pontoon.es |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, and with the boat now named ''Maxi Spindrift 2'', she co-skippered the team to victory in the 45th Rolex Fastnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martín Vanzulli |url=http://www.catsailingnews.com/2013/08/dona-bertarelli-spindrift-2-wins-rolex.html |title=Catamaran Racing, News &amp; Design: Dona Bertarelli Spindrift 2 wins Rolex Fastnet 2013 |publisher=Catsailingnews.com |date=2013-08-15 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also set a new record for the America Discovery Route, beating the time set by [[Franck Cammas]] in 2007 by more than 20 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Alexander |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/sailing/yacht-racing-billionairess-dona-bertarelli-sees-her-team-smash-record-for-the-route-of-discovery-8924637.html |title=Yacht racing billionairess Dona Bertarelli sees her team smash record for the Route of Discovery - Sailing - More Sports |publisher=The Independent |date=2013-11-06 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Dona Bertarelli's Spindrift 2 defended her title by taking line honors at the 46th Rolex Fastnet race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rolex Fastnet Race|title=France Dominates 90th Anniversary Rolex Fastnet Race|url=http://www.rolexfastnetrace.com/Press-Releases-2015/france-dominates-90th-anniversary-rolex-fastnet-race.html|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, on November 22, Dona Bertarelli, with Yann Guichard and their crew, left [[Ushant]] (a French island off the northwest corner of [[Brittany]]) on Spindrift 2, attempting to break the record for a crewed non-stop circumnavigation (the [[Jules Verne Trophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spindrift Racing|title=DEPARTURE OF SPINDRIFT 2 IN JULES VERNE TROPHY RECORD ATTEMPT|url=http://www.spindrift-racing.com/news/le-chrono-est-lance-en|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they did not break the record, Bertarelli became the fastest woman to sail around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sailing at warp speed|url=http://sailingmagazine.net/article-1734-sailing-at-warp-speed.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EDP painting.png|thumb|right|350 px|Electrophoretic Deposition Process]]
'''Electrophoretic deposition''' ('''EPD'''), is a term for a broad range of [[industrial process]]es which includes '''electrocoating''', '''cathodic electrodeposition''', '''anodic electrodeposition''', and '''electrophoretic coating''', or '''electrophoretic painting'''. A characteristic feature of this process is that [[colloid]]al particles suspended in a [[liquid]] medium migrate under the influence of an [[electric field]] ([[electrophoresis]]) and are deposited onto an [[electrode]]. All colloidal particles that can be used to form stable [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]]s and that can carry a charge can be used in electrophoretic deposition. This includes materials such as [[polymers]], [[pigments]], [[dyes]], [[ceramic]]s and [[metals]].

The process is useful for applying materials to any [[electrically conductive]] surface. The materials which are being deposited are the major determining factor in the actual processing conditions and equipment which may be used.

Due to the wide utilization of electrophoretic painting processes in many industries, aqueous EPD is the most common commercially used EPD process.  However, non-aqueous electrophoretic deposition applications are known. Applications of non-aqueous EPD are currently being explored for use in the fabrication of [[electronic component]]s and the production of [[ceramic]] coatings. Non-aqueous processes have the advantage of avoiding the [[electrolysis]] of water and the [[oxygen evolution]] which accompanies electrolysis.

==Uses==
This process is industrially used for applying coatings to metal fabricated products. It has been widely used to coat automobile bodies and parts, tractors and heavy equipment, electrical switch gear, appliances, metal furniture, beverage containers, fasteners, and many other industrial products.

EPD processes are often applied for the fabrication of supported [[titanium dioxide]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) photocatalysts for water purification applications, using precursor powders which can be immobilised using EPD methods onto various support materials. Thick films produced this way allow cheaper and more rapid synthesis relative to [[sol-gel]] thin-films, along with higher levels of photocatalyst surface area.

In the fabrication of [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s EPD techniques are widely employed for the fabrication of porous ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anodes from powder precursors onto conductive substrates.

EPD processed have a number of advantages which have made such methods widely used&lt;ref&gt;"Electrodeposition of nanostructured
coatings and their characterization – a review" Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 9 (2008) 043001 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1468-6996/9/4/043001 (free download)]&lt;/ref&gt;
#The process applies coatings which generally have a very uniform coating thickness without porosity.
#Complex fabricated objects can easily be coated, both inside cavities as well as on the outside surfaces.
#Relatively high speed of coating.
#Relatively high purity.
#Applicability to wide range of materials (metals, ceramics, polymers, )
#Easy control of the coating composition.
#The process is normally automated and requires less human labor than other coating processes.
#Highly efficient utilization of the coating materials result in lower costs relative to other processes.
#The aqueous process which is commonly used has less risk of fire relative to the solvent-borne coatings that they have replaced.
#Modern electrophoretic paint products are significantly more environmentally friendly than many other painting technologies.

Thick, complex ceramic pieces have been made in several research laboratories. Furthermore, EPD has been used to produce customized [[microstructure]]s, such as functional gradients and laminates, through suspension control during processing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtm.kuleuven.ac.be/Research/C2/EPD.htm Processing of ceramic materials – shaping] at [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
  
The first patent for the use of electrophoretic painting was awarded in 1917 to Davey and [[General Electric]].  Since the 1920s, the process has been used for the deposition of [[Latex|rubber latex]].  In the 1930s the first [[patent]]s were issued which described base neutralized, water dispersible [[resin]]s specifically designed for EPD.

Electrophoretic coating began to take its current shape in the late 1950s, when Dr. George E. F. Brewer and the [[Ford Motor Company]] team began working on developing the process for the coating of automobiles.  The first commercial anodic automotive system began operations in 1963.

The first patent for a cathodic EPD product was issued in 1965 and assigned to [[BASF AG]]. [[PPG Industries, Inc.]] was the first to introduce commercially cathodic EPD in 1970.  The first cathodic EPD use in the automotive industry was in 1975.  Today, around 70% of the volume of EPD in use in the world today is the cathodic EPD type, largely due to the high usage of the technology in the automotive industry. It is probably the best system ever developed and has resulted in great extension of body life in the automotive industry

There are thousands of patents which have been issued relating to various EPD compositions, EPD processes, and articles coated with EPD.  Although patents have been issued by various government patent offices, virtually all of the significant developments can be followed by reviewing the patents issued by the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]].

== Process ==
The overall industrial process of electrophoretic deposition consists of several sub-processes:

#Preparation – this usually consists of some kind of cleaning process and may include the application of a conversion coating, typically an inorganic phosphate coating.
#The coating process itself – this usually involves submerging the part into a container or vessel which holds the coating bath or solution and applying direct current electricity through the EPD bath using electrodes. Typically voltages of 25 – 400 volts DC are used in electrocoating or electrophoretic painting applications. The object to be coated is one of the electrodes, and a set of "counter-electrodes" are used to complete the circuit.
#After deposition, the object is normally rinsed to remove the undeposited bath. The rinsing process may utilize an ultrafilter to dewater a portion of the bath from the coating vessel to be used as rinse material.  If an ultrafilter is used, all of the rinsed off materials can be returned to the coating vessel, allowing for high utilization efficiency of the coating materials, as well as reducing the amount of waste discharged into the environment.
#A baking or curing process is normally used following the rinse.  This will [[crosslink]] the polymer and allows the coating, which will be porous due to the evolution of gas during the deposition process, to flow out and become smooth and continuous.

During the EPD process itself, [[direct current]] is applied to a solution of [[polymer]]s with ionizable groups or a [[colloid]]al suspension of polymers with ionizable groups which may also incorporate solid materials such as [[pigment]]s and fillers. The ionizable groups incorporated into the polymer are formed by the reaction of an [[acid]] and a [[Base (chemistry)|base]] to form a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]].  The particular charge, positive or negative, which is imparted to the [[polymer]] depends on the chemical nature of the ionizable group.  If the ionizable groups on the polymer are acids, the polymer will carry a negative charge when salted with a base.  If the ionizable groups on the polymer are bases, the polymer will carry a positive charge when salted with an acid.

There are two types of EPD processes, anodic and cathodic.  In the anodic process, negatively charged material is deposited on the positively charged electrode, or [[anode]].  In the cathodic process, positively charged material is deposited on the negatively charged electrode, or [[cathode]].

When an electric field is applied, all of the charged species migrate by the process of [[electrophoresis]] towards the electrode with the opposite charge.  There are several mechanisms by which material can be deposited on the electrode:

#Charge destruction and the resultant decrease in solubility.
#Concentration coagulation.
#Salting out.

The primary electrochemical process which occurs during aqueous electrodeposition is the [[electrolysis]] of water.  This can be shown by the following two half reactions which occur at the two electrodes:

:'''Anode''': 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(gas) + 4H(+) + 4e(-)
:'''Cathode''': 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 4e(-) → 4OH(-) + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(gas)

In anodic deposition, the material being deposited will have salts of an acid as the charge bearing group.  These negatively charged anions react with the positively charged hydrogen ions (protons) which are being produced at the anode by the electrolysis of water to reform the original acid.  The fully [[protonate]]d acid carries no charge (charge destruction) and is less soluble in water, and may precipitate out of the water onto the anode.

The analogous situation occurs in cathodic deposition except that the material being deposited will have salts of a base as the charge bearing group.  If the salt of the base has been formed by [[protonation]] of the base, the protonated base will react with the hydroxyl ions being formed by electrolysis of water to yield the neutral charged base (again charge destruction) and water. The uncharged polymer is less soluble in water than it was when was charged, and precipitation onto the cathode occurs.

Onium salts, which have been used in the cathodic process, are not protonated bases and do not deposit by the mechanism of charge destruction.  These type of materials can be deposited on the cathode by concentration coagulation and salting out.  As the colloidal particles reach the solid object to be coated, they become squeezed together, and the water in the interstices is forced out.  As the individual [[micelle]]s are squeezed, they collapse to form increasingly larger micelles.  Colloidal stability is inversely proportional to the size of the micelle, so as the micelles get bigger, they become less and less stable until they precipitate from solution onto the object to be coated.  As more and more charged groups are concentrated into a smaller volume, this increases the ionic strength of the medium, which also assists in precipitating the materials out of solution.  Both of these processes are occurring simultaneously and both contribute to the deposition of material.

==Factors affecting electrophoretic painting==
During the aqueous deposition process, gas is being formed at both electrodes.  [[Hydrogen]] gas is being formed at the [[cathode]], and [[oxygen]] gas at the [[anode]].  It should be noted that for a given amount of charge transfer, exactly twice as much hydrogen is generated compared to oxygen on a molecular basis.

This has some significant effects on the coating process.  The most obvious is in the appearance of the deposited film prior to the baking process.  The cathodic process results in considerably more gas being trapped within the film than the anodic process.  Since the gas has a higher [[electrical resistance]] than either depositing film or the bath itself, the amount of gas has a significant effect on the current at a given applied [[voltage]].  This is why cathodic processes are often able to be operated at significantly higher voltages than the corresponding anodic processes.

The deposited coating has significantly higher resistance than the object which is being coated. As the deposited film precipitates, the resistance increases.  The increase in resistance is proportional to the thickness of the deposited film, and thus, at a given voltage, the [[electric current]] decreases as the film gets thicker until it finally reaches a point where deposition has slowed or stopped occurring (self limiting).  Thus the applied voltage is the primary control for the amount of film applied.

The ability for the EPD coating to coat interior recesses of a part is called the "throwpower".  In many applications, it is desirable to use coating materials with a high throwpower.  The throwpower of a coating is dependent on a number of variables, but generally it can be stated that the higher the coating voltage, the further a given coating will "throw" into recesses. High throwpower electrophoretic paints typically use application voltages in excess of 300 volts DC.

The coating temperature is also an important variable affecting the EPD process.  The coating temperature has an effect on the bath [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] and deposited film conductivity, which increases as temperature increases.  Temperature also has an effect on the [[viscosity]] of the deposited film, which in turn affects the ability of the deposited film to release the gas bubbles being formed.

The coalescence temperature of the coating system is also an important variable for the coating designer.  It can be determined by plotting the film build of a given system versus coating temperature keeping the coating time and voltage application profile constant.  At temperatures below the coalescence temperature, film growth behavior and rupturing behavior is quite different from the usual practice as a result of porous deposition.

The coating time also is an important variable in determining the film thickness, the quality of the deposited film, and the throwpower.  Depending on the type of object being coated, coating times of several seconds up to several minutes may be appropriate.

The maximum voltage which can be utilized depends on the type of coating system and a number of other factors.  As already stated, film thickness and throwpower are dependent on the application voltage. However, at excessively high voltages, a phenomenon called "rupture" can occur.  The voltage where this phenomenon occurs is called the "rupture voltage". The result of rupture is a film that is usually very thick and porous.  Normally this is not an acceptable film cosmetically or functionally.  The causes and mechanisms for rupturing are not completely understood, however the following is known:

#Commercially available anodic EPD coating chemistries typically exhibit rupturing at voltages significantly lower than their commercially available cathodic counterparts.
#For a given EPD chemistry, the higher the bath conductivity, the lower the rupture voltage.
#For a given EPD chemistry, the rupture voltages normally decrease as the temperature is increased (for temperatures above the coalescence temperature).
#Additions to a given bath composition of organic solvents and plasticizers which reduce the deposited film's viscosity will often produce higher film thicknesses at a given voltage, but will generally also reduce the throwpower and the rupture voltage.
#The type and preparation of the substrate (material used to make the object being coated) can also have a significant effect on rupturing phenomenon.

==Types of EPD chemistries==

There are two major categories of EPD chemistries:  anodic and cathodic.  Both continue to be used commercially, although the anodic process has been in use industrially for a longer period of time and is thus considered to be the older of the two processes.  There are advantages and disadvantages for both types of processes, and different experts may have different perspectives on some of the pros and cons of each.

The major advantages that are normally touted for the anodic process are:

#Lower costs compared to cathodic process.
#Simpler and less complex control requirements.
#Fewer problems with inhibition of cure of subsequent topcoating layers.
#Less sensitivity to variations in substrate quality.
#The substrate is not subjected to highly alkaline conditions, which may dissolve phosphate and other conversion coatings.
#Certain metals, such as zinc, may become embrittled from the hydrogen gas which is evolved at the cathode.  The anodic process avoids this effect since oxygen is being generated at the anode.
    
The major advantages that are normally touted for the cathodic processes are:

#Higher levels of corrosion protection are possible.  (While many people believe that cathodic technologies have higher [[corrosion]] protection capability, other experts argue that this probably has more to do with the coating polymer and [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] chemistry rather than on which electrode the film is deposited.)
#Higher throwpower can be designed into the product.  (While this may be true with the currently commercially available technologies today, high throwpower anodic systems are known and have been used commercially in the past.)
#Oxidation only occurs at the anode, and thus staining and other problems which may result from the oxidation of the electrode substrate itself is avoided in the cathodic process.

A significant and real difference which is not often mentioned is the fact that acid catalyzed crosslinking technologies are more appropriate to the anodic process.  Such crosslinkers are widely used in all types of coating applications.  These include such popular and relatively inexpensive crosslinkers such as [[melamine]]-[[formaldehyde]], [[phenol]]-formaldehyde, [[urea-formaldehyde]], and [[acrylamide]]-formaldehyde crosslinkers.

Melamine-formaldehyde type crosslinkers in particular are widely used in anodic electrocoatings.  These types crosslinkers are relatively inexpensive and provide a wide range of cure and performance characteristics which allow the coating designer to tailor the product for the desired end use.  Coatings formulated with this type of crosslinker can have acceptable UV light resistance.  Many of them are relatively low viscosity materials and can act as a reactive plasticizer, replacing some of the organic solvent that otherwise might be necessary.  The amount of free formaldehyde, as well as formaldehyde which may be released during the baking process is of concern as these are considered to be hazardous air pollutants.

The deposited film in cathodic systems is quite alkaline, and acid catalyzed crosslinking technologies have not been preferred in cathodic products in general, although there have been some exceptions.  The most common type of crosslinking chemistry in use today with cathodic products are based on urethane and urea chemistries.

The aromatic [[polyurethane]] and urea type crosslinker is one of the significant reasons why many cathodic electrocoats show high levels of protection against corrosion.  Of course it is not the only reason, but if one compares electrocoating compositions with aromatic urethane cHrosslinkers to analogous systems containing aliphatic urethane crosslinkers, consistently systems with aromatic urethane crosslinkers perform significantly better.  However, coatings containing aromatic urethane crosslinkers generally do not perform well in terms of UV light resistance.  If the resulting coating contains aromatic urea crosslinks, the UV resistance will be considerably worse than if only urethane crosslinks can occur.  A disadvantage of aromatic urethanes is that they can also cause yellowing of the coating itself as well as cause yellowing in subsequent topcoat layers.  A significant undesired side reaction which occurs during the baking process produces aromatic polyamines.  Urethane crosslinkers based on [[toluene diisocyanate]] (TDI) can be expected to produce toluene diamine as a side reaction, whereas those based on [[methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]] produce diaminodiphenylmethane and higher order aromatic polyamines.  The undesired aromatic polyamines can inhibit the cure of subsequent acid catalysed topcoat layers, and can cause delamination of the subsequent topcoat layers after exposure to sunlight.  Although the industry has never acknowledged this problem, many of these undesired aromatic polyamines are known or suspected carcinogens.

Besides the two major categories of anodic and cathodic, EPD products can also be described by the base polymer chemistry which is utilized.  There are several polymer types that have been used commercially.  Many of the earlier anodic types were based on maleinized oils of various types, tall oil and linseed oil being two of the more common.  Today, epoxy and the acrylic types predominate. The description and the generally touted advantages are as follows:

#[[Epoxy]]:  Although aliphatic epoxy materials have been used, the majority of EPD epoxy types are based on aromatic epoxy polymers, most commonly based on polymerization of diglycidal ethers of bis phenol A. The polymer backbone may be modified with other types of chemistries to achieve the desired performance characteristics.  Generally, this type of chemistry is used in primer applications where the coating will receive a topcoat, particularly if the coated object needs to withstand sunlight.  This chemistry generally does not have good resistance to UV light.  However, this chemistry is often used where high corrosion resistance is required.
#[[Acryl group|Acrylic]]:  These polymers are based on free radical initiated polymers containing monomers based on [[acrylic acid]] and [[methacrylic acid]] and their many esters which are available.  Such polymers often also include styrene as a monomer. Generally, this type of chemistry is utilized when UVvresistance is desirable.  These polymers also have the advantage of allowing a wider color palette since the polymer is less prone to yellowing when compared to epoxies.

==Non-aqueous electrophoretic deposition==
In certain applications, such as the deposition of ceramic materials, voltages above 3–4V cannot be applied in aqueous EPD if it is necessary to avoid the electrolysis of water. However, higher application voltages may be desirable in order to achieve higher coating thicknesses or to increase the rate of deposition.  In such applications, organic solvents are used instead of water as the liquid medium.  The organic solvents used are generally polar solvents such as  alcohols and ketones.  [[Ethanol]], [[acetone]], and [[methyl ethyl ketone]] are examples of solvents which have been reported as suitable candidates for use in electrophoretic deposition.

{{Internet Marketing}}
'''Email marketing''' is the act of sending a [[commercial message]], typically to a group of people, using [[email]]. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current [[customer]] could be considered email [[marketing]]. It usually involves using email to send [[advertisement]]s, request business, or solicit sales or donations, and is meant to build [[customer loyalty|loyalty]], trust, or [[brand awareness]]. Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database. The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant's relationship with current or previous customers, encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and sharing third-party ads.

== History ==
Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century. Prior to this growth, when emails were novelties to the majority of customers, email marketing was not as effective. In 1978, Gary Thuerk of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) sent out the first [[mass email]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/spam#ref1072166|title=spam {{!}} unsolicited e-mail|access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to approximately 400 potential clients via the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]] (ARPANET). He claims that this resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Gina |title=Unsung innovators: Gary Thuerk, the father of spam |url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2539767/cybercrime-hacking/unsung-innovators--gary-thuerk--the-father-of-spam.html |accessdate=30 October 2018 |work=Computerworld |date=3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails. 

However, as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication, in the 1990s, users increasingly began referring to it as "[[email spam|spam]]", and began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs. In order to effectively communicate a message through email, marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user, without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software.

Historically, it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because [[target market]]s cannot be adequately defined. Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time, and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration, revealing a communication channel's scope. At the same time, however, it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods, such as television advertisements, cannot be captured.

==Types==
Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails:

=== Transactional emails ===
Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer's action with a company. To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages, these communications' primary purpose must be "to facilitate, complete, or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender" along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PUBLIC LAW 108–187—DEC. 16, 2003 117 STAT. 2699|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ187/pdf/PLAW-108publ187.pdf|publisher=U.S Government GPO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages, password reset emails, purchase or order confirmation emails, order status emails, reorder emails, and email receipts.

The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it. But, due to their high open rates (51.3% compared to 36.6% for email newsletters), transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers; to anticipate and answer questions; or to cross-sell or up-sell products or services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ADIKESAVAN|first1=T.|title=MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS BEST PRACTICES AND APPLICATIONS IN BUSINESS|isbn=8120348966|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E7B2BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=The+primary+purpose+of+a+transactional+email+is+to+convey+information+regarding+the+action+that+triggered+it.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ddl9uJDdSe&amp;sig=JYuZBscLK_KedFxFL9edU7hxVGM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-uKfVe3ML4WryATVubTgAg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw|access-date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support, which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails. There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services, which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns (such as [[Referral marketing|customer referral programs]]). {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Direct emails ===
Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message (for example, a special offer or a product catalog). Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to, or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Comparison to traditional mail==
There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional [[advertising mail]].

===Advantages===
Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons:
* Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail, mainly because with email, most of the cost falls on the recipient{{cn|date=August 2018}}. 
* Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP (email service provider) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients. The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of [[consumer behavior]]{{cn|date=August 2018}}.
* Almost half of American [[Internet]] users check or send email on a typical day,&lt;ref&gt;Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, [http://www.pewinternet.org/trends.asp "Tracking surveys"], March 2000 – March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mailermailer.com/resources/metrics/2012/how-scheduling-affects-rates.rwp How Scheduling Affects Rates]. Mailermailer.com (July 2012). Retrieved on July 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''BtoB Magazine'', [http://www.btobonline.com/article/20110901/EMAIL13/309019997/early-morning-email-blasts-pay-off-with-strong-opens-clicks "Early Email Blasts Results in Higher Click &amp; Open Rates"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122001746/http://www.btobonline.com/article/20110901/EMAIL13/309019997/early-morning-email-blasts-pay-off-with-strong-opens-clicks |date=2011-11-22 }}, September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
* As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers. According to the report, legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73% in the U.S.; six percent were filtered as spam, and 22% were missing. This lags behind other countries: Australia delivers at 90%, Canada at 89%, Britain at 88%, France at 84%, Germany at 80% and Brazil at 79%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clickz.com/email-deliverability-is-on-the-decline-report/104466/ Roberts, A. "Email deliverability is on the decline: report", ''ClickZ'']&lt;/ref&gt;

* Additionally, consumers receive on average about 90 emails per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2014-2018-Executive-Summary.pdf|title=Email Statistics Report, 2014-2018|last=Radicati|first= Sara|date=|website=The Radicati Group, Inc|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=proprietary and confidential research methodology; researcher has a product to sell|date=August 2018}}

* Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ([[CAN-SPAM]]),&lt;ref name=canspam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/canspam.htm|title=Consumer Information|author=|date=|website=Consumer Information|access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, or their [[Internet service provider]]'s [[acceptable use policy]].

==Opt-in email advertising==
[[Opt-in email]] advertising, or [[permission marketing]], is advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it. &lt;ref name="fairhead"&gt;Fairhead, N. (2003) "All hail the brave new world of permission marketing via email" (''Media'' 16, August 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm's customers. Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions, or new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Dilworth | first=Dianna | date=2007 | url=http://www.dmnews.com/Ruths-Chris-Steak-House-sends-sizzling-e-mails-for-special-occasions/article/94733/ | title=Ruth's Chris Steak House sends sizzling e-mails for special occasions | work=DMNews | access-date=February 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of advertising, a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter.

With a foundation of opted-in contact information stored in their [[database]], marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using [[autoresponder]]s—known as [[drip marketing]]. They can also segment their promotions to specific [[market segmentation|market segments]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brian J. &amp; Montazemia, A. (2004) ''Management Information Systems'' (Canada: McGraw-Hill Ryerson Ltd.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal requirements==

===Australia===
The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]], widely known as "ACMA". The act defines the term ''unsolicited electronic messages'', states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages, and gives other key information.

The "Canada Anti-Spam Law" (CASL) went into effect on July 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/breaking-news/law-could-force-idle-brokers-back-to-dark-ages-72906.aspx|title=Law could force idle brokers back to dark ages|first=Bethan|last=Moorcraft|date=|website=Insurance Business|access-date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt-in from users, and the maximum fines for noncompliance are [[Canadian dollar|CA$]]1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/eng/home |title=Canada's law on spam|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=July 19, 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union ===
In 2002 the [[European Union]] (EU) introduced the [[Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications]]. Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes. The Directive establishes the opt-in regime, where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient; this does not apply to business email addresses.

The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states. In the UK it is covered under the [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2003/20032426.htm The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114055417/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2003/20032426.htm |date=November 14, 2006 }}. Opsi.gov.uk. Retrieved on July 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication.

===United States ===
The [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] was passed by Congress as a direct response to the growing number of complaints over spam emails.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally, that those who send commercial emails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them, and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them. The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAN-SPAM Act: A Compliance Guide for Business|url=http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business|website=FTC.gov|publisher=BCP Business Center|access-date=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it does not ban spam emailing outright, but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are "materially false or misleading". In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format, their content and labeling. As a result, many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act. A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act. To comply with the act's regulation of commercial email, services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address, provide a one-click unsubscribe feature, and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In addition to satisfying legal requirements, email service providers (ESPs) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns. The service providers supply email templates and general best practices, as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically. Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers. They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened, and whether the recipients clicked on any [[Hyperlink|links]] within the messages.

The CAN-SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no-fee provision for opting out, further definition of "sender", post office or private mail boxes count as a "valid physical postal address" and definition of "person". These new provisions went into effect on July 7, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/05/canspam.shtm|title= FTC Approves New Rule Provision Under The CAN-SPAM Act|publisher= FTC.gov|date=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/federal_register_notices/definitions-and-implementation-under-can-spam-act-16-cfr-part-316/080521canspamact.pdf|title= 16 CFR Part 316 Definitions and Implementation Under the CAN–SPAM Act; Final Rule|publisher= FTC.gov|date=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Félix Rigau Carrera'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Rigau'''|'''Carrera'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (August 30, 1894 – October 13, 1954), known as "El Águila de Sabana Grande" (The Eagle from Sabana Grande), was the first Puerto Rican [[aviator|pilot]] and the first Puerto Rican pilot to fly on air mail carrying duties in Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
Rigau Carrera was one of nine siblings born to Felip Rigau Balbàs, a Spanish [[Navy]] sailor from [[Catalonia]], and Carmen Carrera de Rigau, a Puerto Rican homemaker, in the town of [[Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="FRC"&gt;"The Puerto Ricans: A Documentary History"; by Kal Wagenheim (Editor), Olga Jimenez de Wagenheim (Editor); page 355- 56; Publisher: Markus Wiener Publishers; Revised edition; {{ISBN|1-55876-476-3}}; {{ISBN|978-1-55876-476-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he received his primary and secondary education. As a child he showed an interest in mechanics and would often [[model aircraft]], using the local cathedral as a launching pad for his small fixed-wing aircraft replicas.

After he graduated from high school, he enrolled at the Colegio de Agricultura y Artes Mecanicas (CAAM) (now the [[University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez|University of Puerto Rico]]) at [[Mayagüez]] and studied electronics and mechanical engineering. During his years at college he continued with his hobby of building and designing airplane models.&lt;ref name="FRC"/&gt;

After he earned his college degree in mechanical engineering, he joined the [[United States Army]]&lt;ref name="A"&gt;"Historia militar de Puerto Rico"; by Hector Andres Negroni (Author); Pages: 387; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Language: Spanish; {{ISBN|84-7844-138-7}}; {{ISBN|978-84-7844-138-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After serving in the Army, he traveled to [[Long Island]] where he finished his flying training &lt;ref name="EM"&gt;"El Mundo"; "Fallece El Aguila - Fue Primer Boricua Manejo Avion en la Isla" (Spanish); by: Malen Rojas Daporte; October 20, 1954; Number 13,448&lt;/ref&gt;

==War War I==
After he earned his college degree in mechanical engineering, he joined the [[United States Army]] and was assigned to the Aviation Section, [[U.S. Signal Corps]] (the military aviation service of the United States Army from 1914 to 1918 and a direct ancestor of the United States Air Force). While in the Army, he traveled extensively around the world and became acquainted with many of the world's famous pilots of the era. He became the first Puerto Rican parachutist as a member of the Aviation Section of the U.S. Signal Corps, whose members were among the Army's first parachutist. His stint in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps inspired him to go and attend various aviation schools upon his release from the military.

Enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] upon the outbreak of [[World War I]]. After receiving additional aviation training, he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant and assigned to the First Marine Air Squadron which deployed to France as the newly renamed 1st Marine Aviation Force in July 1918. There Rigau Carrera and his unit provided bomber and fighter support to the Navy's Day Wing, Northern Bombing Group. While serving in First Marine Air Squadron, Rigau Carrera became the first Puerto Rican to pilot a fixed-wing aircraft and the first Hispanic fighter pilot in the Marines.

==Historical flights==
[[File:Félix Rigau Carrera.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Rigau Carrera poses in his plane (1919)]]
In July 1919, he went to Texas. Rigau Carrera met Bertha Dunston (1900–1989), who became his wife in 1919 and with whom he was to have three children, Félix (1921–1995), Carmen (1923–2016), and Jaime (1925–1970) &lt;ref name="FTS"&gt;"The Family Tree Searcher"; Volume 13 - Number 2; December 2009; By L. Roane Hunt&lt;/ref&gt; Rigau Carrera returned to Puerto Rico and made it clear to everyone that knew him that his main objective was to be able to someday own his own and fly his own aircraft. Consequently, his four brothers helped him financially to buy his first aircraft, a [[Curtiss JN-4]], $2,250 in 1919. The Curtiss JN-4 "Jenny" was one of a series of "JN" biplanes built by the Curtiss Aeroplane Company of Hammondsport, New York, later the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company.&lt;ref name="FRC"/&gt; 
[[File:FelixRigau4.JPG|thumb|Rigau Carrera poses in front of his aircraft a Curtiss JN-4]]
Rigau Carrera piloted his first flight in Puerto Rico, flying out of [[Camp Las Casas]], the exact area where [[Residencial Las Casas]] is currently located, becoming the first Puerto Rican pilot to do so. At the time, the area was used by the military as an air base and it was also Puerto Rico's first commercial airport, and Rigau Carrera was allowed to perform his historic flight from the air field. Rigau Carrera then started using the air base frequently, for exhibition flights and to carry paying passengers on sightseeing trips. He became a national hero in Puerto Rico during the 1920s, traveling to many Puerto Rican cities by air. The local town people celebrated his landings with live music and fireworks and he became known as "The Eagle of Sabana Grande".&lt;ref name="FRC"/&gt;

In 1931, Rigau Carrera was given a license by [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]'s mail system authority to deliver mail via air mail throughout the island, becoming the first pilot to fly on air mail carrying duties in Puerto Rico. Rigau Carrera then established a system similar to the one used by the [[airline]]s today, where he would fly people from one point of the island to another, with paying customers on board.&lt;ref name="FRC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; Not all of his career went without problems, as Rigau Carrera almost lost his life during flights twice, once in [[San German, Puerto Rico|San German]] and another time in [[Guanica, Puerto Rico|Guanica]].&lt;ref name="FRC"/&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Felix Rigau.jpg|74px|left|thumb|Félix Rigau Carrera]]
Rigau Carrera  settled in [[Gloucester, Virginia]] in the early 1920s. He lived with his family in an old Abingdon Glebe School House and constructed a building to house a flour mill and other enterprises. Rigau Carrera founded the Rigau Concrete Works which manufactured a wide variety of items to meet the industrial needs of the developing county. Besides concrete blocks, he cast septic tanks, culverts, burial vaults and yard furniture. Rigau Carrera and his wife Bertha, who were certified undertakers, established a funeral home. He amassed a fortune as the owner of the funeral home and [[concrete]] factory. While living in Virginia he joined the Virginia Commonwealth USNRF (US Naval Reserve Force) &lt;ref name="FTS"/&gt;

When the United States entered World War II, Rigau Carrera joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] and where he served throughout the war years. During these years, Félix and Bertha divorced. He met and married Estella Martins from the Azores of Portugal with whom he had three more children, Félix, Philip, and Maria.&lt;ref name="EM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FTS"/&gt;

Rigau Carrera died at the age of 60 and was buried with [[military funeral|full military honors]] at Abingdon Episcopal Church Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=
|work=Gloucester Gazette-Journal|title=Gloucester Deaths |date=October 19, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; His native hometown, Sabana Grande, named a street ''Calle Félix Rigau Carrera'' in his honor. On September 14, 2011, he was honored posthumously during the Hispanic Heritage Awards at Cleveland International Airport in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clevelandairport.com/Airport-Guide/News---Media-Relations/Top-Stories/CLE_Bio_PDF.aspx{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandairport.com/Airport-Guide/News---Media-Relations/Top-Stories/Increased-Security-Presence.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026014610/http://www.clevelandairport.com/Airport-Guide/News---Media-Relations/Top-Stories/Increased-Security-Presence.aspx |archivedate=2011-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Legion]] Post 36 in [[Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico]] was named in honor of LTJG Félix Rigau Carrera.

'''Groupe Barrière''' operates casinos in France, [[Switzerland]] and elsewhere in Europe. The group also operates in the French [[Luxury resort|luxury]] hotel industry and in the catering and [[leisure]] industries.

==History==
[[File:Normandy Barrière Deauville.JPG|thumb|250px|5 Stars Normandy Hotel, [[Deauville]]]]

===François André, founder===
*'''1912-1951''': re-inventing the [[Deauville]] and [[La Baule]] seaside resorts

As a young man from [[Ardèche]] who came up to [[Paris]] in the early 20th century, François André started a casino business by acquiring the Ostend casino in Belgium, while Eugène Cornuché, his partner, began building the '''Hôtel Normandy''' and having the [[Deauville]] casino rebuilt in 1912. In 1918, François André set up the Haussmann gaming circle in [[Paris]] and continued to grow his business by designing the [[La Baule]] resort based on the Deauville model and by purchasing the '''Hôtel Royal''' and casino in 1923. He invented the modern day resort concept by combining casinos, luxury hotels and sports facilities all on one site.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

In 1926, François André took on the construction of the '''Hôtel Hermitage''' at [[La Baule]].

1927, he took over from Eugène Cornuché as managing director of SHCD (Société des Hôtels et Casino de Deauville). He then had the Hôtel du Golf in Deauville built.

===[[Lucien Barrière]]===
*'''1951-1987''' - Groupe Lucien Barrière’s founding and development throughout France

In 1951, Lucien Barrière, François André’s nephew, joined the group.

In 1957 Lucien Barrière was appointed to the Board of several of the group’s entities and became his uncle’s sole legal heir in 1961. He undertook a project to modernise and develop the group by buying new establishments in [[Trouville-sur-Mer|Trouville]], [[Dinard]], [[St-Malo]], [[Royan]] and [[Enghien-les-Bains]].

In 1980, SHCLB (Société Hôtelière de la Chaîne Lucien Barrière) was founded to cover the [[La Baule]] hotels and casinos.

In 1987, Lucien Barrière participated in the arrival of slot machines in France.

===Diane Barrière-Desseigne===
*'''1990-2000''':

In the early 1990s, [[Accor]] became a major SHCLB shareholder.

In 1990, Diane Barrière-Desseigne succeeded her father, Lucien Barrière, and launched major renovation projects. On top of their prestige, the hotels are closely connected to the film industry and the Arts. The elite figures of the film industry visit the [[Normandy Barrière]] and the Royal Barrière during the [[American Film Festival]] in Deauville.

In 1995, Diane Barrière-Desseigne suffered a very serious plane accident and from 1997, her husband Dominique Desseigne co-managed the SHCD and SHCLB at her side.

In 1998, SHCD bought [[Fouquet's]] restaurant and brand.

Diane Barrière-Desseigne died in 2001. Dominique Desseigne took over group management and became chairman of SFCMC.

===Dominique Desseigne===
*'''Since 2001''': Under the chairmanship of Dominique Desseigne, the SHCD and the SHCLB took on a new dimension with the first international developments.

In 2003, SHCLB opened the Casino Barrière de [[Montreux]] in [[Switzerland]], which became the leading casino in Switzerland in 2008 in terms of total gross gaming takings.&lt;ref&gt;*Source: Commission Fédérale des Maisons de Jeux en Suisse (Swiss Casino Federal Gaming Commission)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year, SHCD took over the Ryads Resort Development, owner of the land on which the Hôtel Naoura Barrière in [[Marrakech]] (Morocco) was later built, supported by top ranking investors who purchased an equity stake in Ryads Resort Development.

In 2004, the Desseigne-Barrière family, [[Accor]] and [[Colony Capital|Colony Capital investment funds]] decided to team up as Société Hôtelière de la Chaîne Lucien Barrière, subsequently renamed Groupe Lucien Barrière, which combined the businesses of SHCD, SHCLB and Accor Casinos to create a prestigious casino and hotel group.

Since 2005, the expansion has continued with the opening of [[casino]]s in [[Toulouse]], [[Cairo]], [[Leucate]], [[Blotzheim]] and [[Lille]], the opening of the Naoura Barrière in [[Marrakech]] (Morocco), Hôtel Fouquet’s Barrière in [[Paris]] and the Spark (fitness centre for treatments, sport and Spa) in [[Enghien-les-Bains]]. The Hôtel Barrière [[Lille]] will open during autumn 2010 and the hotel complex and balneo-therapy centre adjoining the Casino Barrière de [[Ribeauvillé]] is forecast to open late 2011.

During the same period, the public service concessions of the Barrière Casinos in [[La Baule]], [[Dinard]], [[Deauville]], [[Saint-Malo]], [[Nice]], [[Cassis]] and [[Saint-Raphaël, Var|Saint Raphaël]] were renewed, which reveals the confidence these towns place in the group.

On 15 April 2009, [[Colony Capital]] sold its Groupe Lucien Barrière shares to [[Accor]], which now holds a 49% equity stake in the company.

In 2010, Groupe Lucien Barrière and [[Française des Jeux (lottery)|Française des Jeux]] designed an on-line gaming platform with 3D online gaming, which is called LB Poker company.&lt;ref name="gz-news"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://gamingzion.com/gamblingnews/european-commission-finally-happy-with-french-gambling-laws-1768|title= European Commission Approve French Gambling Laws|last=Michael Franceze|date= 25 November 2010|work=GamingZion|publisher=2iVentures|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''home business''' (or "home-based business" or "HBB") is a [[small business]] that operates from the business owner's home office. In addition to location, home businesses are usually defined by having a very small number of [[employee]]s, usually all immediate [[family]] of the [[Businessperson|business owner]], in which case it is also a [[family business]]. Home businesses generally lack shop frontage, customer parking and street [[advertising]] signs. Such businesses are sometimes prohibited by residential [[zoning]] regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Can I Start a Business in My Garage?|author=C. Jeanne Heida|date=April 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospect of working from home has gained credibility over the years. Home offices can now compete with small commercial businesses and save on rent in the process. It may also be possible to tax deduct some of your home expenses while running a home based business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|title=How to run a Business from Home|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/10/jobs-home-working-tips|publisher=theGuardian.com|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faxes, high speed internet connections, dedicated home telephone lines, and cell phones help to make a home-based business a reality. Earlier home businesses had been where families lived on the second floor of their house while converting the first floor into a store, where upon close of business they would secure the first floor and retire to the upper floors. This type of home business is still done in some rural areas. Many home businesses are started off in a much smaller capacity whilst the owner is still employed elsewhere, and then expanded once they are proven to be profitable.

== Home-based business ==
The concept of home-based business, as opposed to the previous terminology of "cottage industry", first appeared in 1978. The phrase was coined by Marion Behr, the originator of a study to find out what businesses women throughout America were carrying on in their homes. The preview edition of ''Enterprising Women''&lt;ref&gt;Jersey Woman, Sept/Oct 1981 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; wrote about the search to gather information pertaining to home workers throughout the nation. Numerous magazines&lt;ref&gt;Changing Times, May 1984, At Work, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NJ Success, Sept 1982, The Businesswoman&lt;/ref&gt; and organizations helped to disseminate information regarding the study. Ultimately 40,000 letters were received, many indicating the problems the respondents experienced while carrying on businesses from their homes.

The problems were analyzed and confronted in two ways. In 1980 the National Alliance of Homebased Businesswomen was founded to combat the isolation expressed by the respondents as well as to fight the laws which made conducting their businesses difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Family Circle, July 1981, Gerri Hirshey p. 80-83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jersey Woman, Sept/Oct 1981 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Testimony:US Labor Dept (rm 2508) Jan 25, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Senate, Committee on Labor and Human Resources. re: S2145 Proposals to amend Fair Labor Standards Act:Testimony of Sen. William S. Cohen, Mary Clement, Audrey Pudvah, Sol C. Chaiken, Marion R. Behr, Cora Lee Kern, Mark De Bernardo; February 9, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Then ''Women Working Home: The Homebased Guide and Directory'' by Marion Behr and Wendy Lazar was published.&lt;ref&gt;WWH Press, 1st Ed 1981, 2nd Ed 1983&lt;/ref&gt; It contained the stories of many women who ran home-based businesses throughout the country in many diverse fields, as well as information on business formation, conduct and compliance with the law. It sold 50,000 copies. During this time many national magazines wrote about these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Handmade, Fall 1892&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parents, Sept 1983, Enterprising Mothers, Phyllis Gilles p. 47,54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Changing Times, Running a Business from Home, Feb 1983, p. 26, 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inc, Oct 1984, Home is where the work is, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Woman, Jan 1985, Who’s News, Vivian Doering, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; At the White House Conference on Small Business in 1986, one of the major resolutions was a recommendation favoring lifting restrictions on home-based business.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the White House Conference on Small Business 1986, Resolution 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of home businesses continues to grow due to the increases in technology. In Great Britain, 8 million people were running an online home-based business as of April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph, 8 million Britons run online home-based businesses, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensing requirements for home-based businesses in the United States vary based on industry and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NicoleD |title=Licensing Requirements for Home Based Businesses |url=http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/community-blogs/business-law-advisor/licensing-requirements-home-based-businesses |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822132102/http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/community-blogs/business-law-advisor/licensing-requirements-home-based-businesses |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 August 2012 |publisher=sba.gov |accessdate=13 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expanded home-based businesses==
Numerous businesses, initially started as home-based, have expanded to become significantly larger operations. These include:

* [[Apple Inc.]], started by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak from Steve Jobs's garage
* [[Hewlett-Packard]], whose original location is now a museum, the HP Garage
* [[Amazon.com]], internet retailer founded by Jeff Bezos

Dr Michael Readhead lead the research team to the discovery for the formula we now know as Nurofen, whilst head Research Chemist at  Reckitts-Benckiser. Nurofen [[brand name]] of a range of pain-relief medication containing [[ibuprofen]] made by [[Reckitt Benckiser]].&lt;ref name=RSC.org-Nurofen/&gt;  Introduced in 1983, the Nurofen brand was acquired following Reckitt Benckiser's acquisition of [[Boots Healthcare]] in 2005.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  The brand is primarily marketed and sold in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name=RSC.org-Nurofen/&gt; other parts of Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  In 2016 it was the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medication sold in Great Britain, with sales of £116.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A breakdown of the over-the-counter medicines market in Britain in 2016|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20202662.article|accessdate=29 May 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variants===
[[File:Nurofen tablets on pharmacy shelf.jpg|thumb|Boxes of Nurofen on a pharmacy shelf]]
There are 11 variants of Nurofen, all of which contain ibuprofen as an active ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Nurofen.com|title=Nurofen website|publisher=Nurofen.com|date= |accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ibuprofen is variously formulated as the [[free acid]], or the [[lysine]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]].  For oral formulations, i.e., taken by mouth, it is available in the conventional solid round tablet, a torpedo-shaped solid caplet, or may alternatively be in the form of a soft gel cap.  It is also available as a topical gel, which is applied directly to the surface of the skin.&lt;ref name=RSC.org-NurofenGel/&gt;  In some cases these are marketed as being useful for treating specific types of pain; such as [[back pain]] or [[period pain]].  The primary difference among the various formulations is speed and duration of ibuprofen absorption.  According to the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (UK MHRA), the form of ibuprofen in 'Nurofen Tension Headache' ([[ibuprofen lysine]]) is absorbed nearly twice as fast as the form in 'Nurofen Period Pain' (ibuprofen free acid), with the former reaching peak blood concentrations in 38&amp;nbsp;minutes, compared to 80&amp;nbsp;minutes for the latter.&lt;ref name=MHRA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/l-unit1/documents/websiteresources/con2023564.pdf|title=MHRA Approval Summary|format=pdf|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some variants of Nurofen contain additional active ingredients; for example, 'Nurofen Cold &amp; Flu' contains the non-[[sedation|sedating]] [[decongestant]] [[pseudoephedrine]].  Others are advertised as being targeted for specific pain types, for example [[Menstrual pain|period pain]].&lt;ref name=RSC.org-Nurofen/&gt;

====Nurofen Plus====
Nurofen Plus is a pain relief medication based on [[codeine]] and [[ibuprofen]].&lt;ref name="MJA"&gt;[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/188_01_070108/dut10966_fm.html The Medical Journal of Australia]. ''Nurofen Plus misuse: an emerging cause of perforated gastric ulcer''.  Accessed 2 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  It contains 12.8&amp;nbsp;[[Gram|mg]] of [[codeine phosphate]] (a mild [[opioid analgesic]]) and 200&amp;nbsp;mg of ibuprofen,&lt;ref name="MJA"/&gt; which is an [[NSAID]].  Nurofen Plus is the only product in the Nurofen range that contains codeine.

The original Nurofen Plus tablet was manufactured in two equal parts, joined together, and then coated.  One part would contain the 12.8&amp;nbsp;mg of codeine phosphate, and the other part contained 200&amp;nbsp;mg of ibuprofen.  The tablets could be forcefully split into their two constituent active ingredients; for recreational use of codeine.  Such drugs have a potential for misuse because they are available freely to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12880547|year=2003|last1=Chetty|first1=R|last2=Baoku|first2=Y|last3=Mildner|first3=R|last4=Banerjee|first4=A|last5=Vallance|first5=D|last6=Haddon|first6=A|last7=Labib|first7=M|title=Severe hypokalaemia and weakness due to Nurofen misuse|volume=40|issue=Pt 4|pages=422–3|doi=10.1258/000456303766477101|journal=Annals of Clinical Biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 product recall===
On 25 August 2011, it was reported that several packs of Nurofen Plus were found to contain [[Quetiapine|Seroquel XR]] — an [[anti-psychotic]] drug used to treat [[schizophrenia]] — in [[Boots UK|Boots]] stores across London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellenews.com/2011/08/26/world/nurofen-sabotaged-across-london/|title=Nurofen "sabotaged" across London|publisher=Bellenews.com|date=26 August 2011|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|author=Jo Adetunji|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/aug/26/nurofen-plus-recalled-sabotage|title=Nurofen Plus recalled as drug manufacturer suspects sabotage|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|date=27 August 2011|accessdate=17 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8726297/Nurofen-Plus-recalled-amid-sabotage-fears.html|title=Nurofen Plus recalled amid sabotage fears|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|date=26 August 2011|accessdate=17 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next day, a safety alert was issued by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA).  Pharmacists were told to check each package of Nurofen Plus to look for anti-psychotic drugs. There were three batches of Nurofen Plus which were affected by the alert.  Reckitt Benckiser, manufacturer of Nurofen Plus, said that it did not know where the drugs had been switched.  The product was re-released in October in cellophane-sealed packs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15106529|title=Nurofen Plus goes back on sale in tamper-proof packs|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=29 September 2011|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher McGuire was later found guilty of one count of contaminating goods, and two of administering a noxious substance, and jailed for 18 months.  McGuire cost the manufacturers £2.4m, and saved himself £7, when he put anti-psychotic drugs in empty packets of the painkiller.  The scheme involved asking for Nurofen Plus at a pharmacy counter, and then attempting to pay for it with a card he knew would be declined.  This created a sufficient distraction for McGuire to discreetly swap the contaminated packet for the fresh one and walk away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18203634|title=Nurofen Plus tampering: Christopher McGuire jailed|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misleading advertising===
====Australia====
In 2010, the Australian consumer advocate [[Choice (Australian consumer organisation)|Choice]] awarded Nurofen a 'Shonky' for charging more for 'targeted' products, all of which had the same active ingredient as the base product.&lt;ref&gt;http://classic.choice.com.au/shonkyaward/hall-of-shame/shonkys-2010/shonky-2010-nurofen.aspx{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Australian [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] upheld a complaint that Nurofen's advertising of different products for different pain was "misleading or likely to be misleading", and ordered that "any representation that refers to two or more Nurofen products that contain equivalent quantities of ibuprofen and include the same product specific indications on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods must clearly indicate, in the body of the advertisement, that the two products can be used for the same purposes and are interchangeable (or words to that effect)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/advert-complaint/nurofen-reckitt-benckiser-australia-pty-ltd-complaints-no-2012-08-010-and-2012-10-024|title=Nurofen - Reckitt Benckiser (Australia)|date=9 May 2014|work=tga.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, the Australian consumer affairs television programme ''[[The Checkout]]'' ran a story about Nurofen's claims about targeting specific pain.  [[Edelman]], the PR company for [[Reckitt Benckiser]] provided a statement, some of which was used in the programme.  Included in the information provided by Edelman were photocopies of some 'sciencey looking documents' that confirmed that Ibuprofen was 'Non-selective'.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In March 2015, the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) launched proceedings against Reckitt Benckiser; for misleading advertising for its targeted pain range.  In December 2015, the [[Federal Court of Australia]] found that Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Nurofen, had misled consumers with its "Nurofen Specific pain range", and ordered that all Nurofen specific pain products be removed from retail sale within three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-14/court-finds-nurofen-made-misleading-pain-relief-claims/7025848|title=Nurofen made misleading pain relief claims: Federal Court|date=14 December 2015|work=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A spokeswoman for Reckitt Benckiser argued that, "[This] specific-pain range" was intended "to help consumers navigate their pain relief options, particularly within the grocery environment where there is no healthcare professional to assist decision making".&lt;ref name="theguardian_2015_dec_14"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/14/nurofen-targeted-painkillers-reckitt-benckiser?CMP=twt_gu|title=Targeted painkillers zero in on one vital organ – the wallet|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=14 December 2015|accessdate=14 December 2015|author=Moore, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACCC said that the products were found to be "no more effective at treating the type of pain described on its packaging than any of the other Nurofen specific pain products", and sold for almost twice the price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nurofen maker Reckitt Benckiser defends Australia packaging|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35090087|work=[[BBC News]]|date=14 December 2015|author= |accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific pain range painkillers include Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension; and all contain the "same active ingredient, 342&amp;nbsp;milligrams of ibuprofen lysine".&lt;ref name="theguardian_2015_dec_14"/&gt;

In April 2016, the Federal Court imposed a $1.7 million fine on Reckitt Benckiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nurofen maker fined $1.7m for misleading customers on 'specific pain' relief range |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-29/nurofen-maker-fined-$1.7m-misleading-customers/7370022 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=29 April 2016 |accessdate=16 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mnJQbE3P?url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-29/nurofen-maker-fined-$1.7m-misleading-customers/7370022 |archivedate=16 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACCC appealed the decision in May arguing that $1.7 million in penalties did not act as an adequate deterrent for a company the size of Reckitt Benckiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Danuta |last=Kozaki |title=ACCC seeks $6m fine against Nurofen maker for misleading consumers |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-23/accc-appeal-against-fine-for-nurofen-maker-reckitt-benckiser/7437184 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=23 May 2016 |accessdate=16 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mnLu9RAy?url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-23/accc-appeal-against-fine-for-nurofen-maker-reckitt-benckiser/7437184 |archivedate=16 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, the Federal Court increased the fine to $6 million, the highest corporate penalty ever awarded for misleading conduct under the [[Australian Consumer Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lucy |last=Cormack |title=Nurofen fine for misleading consumers increased to $6 million |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/nurofen-fine-for-misleading-consumers-increased-to-6-million-20161215-gtcetc.html |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |date=16 December 2016 |accessdate=16 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mnJrr3oB?url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/nurofen-fine-for-misleading-consumers-increased-to-6-million-20161215-gtcetc.html |archivedate=16 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
Following the 2015 Australian decision, the UK [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) said that it was investigating earlier complaints about a television advertisement for Nurofen Express; alleged to be misleading, as it implied that the medicine targeted muscles in the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/15/neurofen-makers-investigation-court-rules-misleading-adverts|title=Nurofen makers under investigation after court rules on misleading adverts|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=15 December 2015|author= |accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ivo Toman was born in 1966 in Frýdek-Místek. He suffered from [[Tourette's syndrome]]. At the age of 6, he contracted meningitis. Toman was often ridiculed in school due to his handicap. Learning disgusted him and he eventually changed schools. A psychology teacher motivated Toman to learn. After graduating from high school, he went to VŠLD College in [[Zvolen]], where he graduated in 1988.&lt;ref name="jak"&gt;http://www.jak-vydelat.cz/index.php?id=11&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded the International Taxus, which operates in the fields of personal development and psychology. The enterprise began by producing  a nutritional supplement. The firm expanded to Slovakia and Hungary with other products. In 2002, he moved to Prague. He and his wife Martina Kralickova began to develop a teaching English, which in 2004 put into practice in the Czech and foreign markets.

In 2008 he was awarded inclusion in the ''1000 Almanac Leaders of Czech Republic''. In 2009 he won the ''small dolphin'' award from the Czech marketing company, at the ''2009 Marketer of the year'' awards. In 2012 in Bratislava was announced as ''The bestselling author of 2011'' by  the network bookstore Panta Rhei.

On 1 March 2012, Lamothe was designated as the Prime Minister of Haiti by President Martelly following the resignation of Prime Minister [[Garry Conille]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-5067-haiti-politic-laurent-lamothe-candidat-designated-for-the-position-of-prime-minister.html "Laurent Lamothe candidat designated for the position of Prime Minister"]. Haiti Libre. 1 March 2012. Retrieved on 3 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully served as Prime Minister from March 2012 to December 2014, the longest tenure of any Prime Minister in the last three decades.  During his time in office, Lamothe presided over the design and implementation of an important social policy agenda that targeted the poorest sectors of the Haitian population. Lamothe also presided over the largest infrastructure development in recent history, which included the construction and rehabilitation of schools, public buildings, bridges and roads.

During Lamothe’s tenure as Prime Minister, foreign direct investment increased to the highest level since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in the mid 1980s. Under his leadership, the government pursued reforms that made Haiti a safer and more business-friendly country with the implementation of a 15-year tax break to companies investing in the island nation.

He also pushed for an increase of the police force by 30 percent. He fought to improve the living conditions of the poorest in Haiti. He implemented social programs that benefited the most vulnerable, he spearheaded the free education program, and promoted good governance by tackling corruption.

He had an impact in the fight against extreme poverty – According to a 2014 World Bank study, from 2012 to 2014, the number of people in extreme poverty in Haiti dropped from 31% to 24% thanks to the social program EDE PEP, which benefited 2 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Extreme poverty drops in Haiti.

Lamothe implemented programs to fight corruption, and improved conditions to facilitate Foreign Direct Investments (FDI).  From 2011 t0 2013, FDI increased by 56% compared to the 2006-2010 period. Along with that, through the GOH’s free education program, elementary school attendance rate rose from 55 to 90%. Close to 1.4 million children between the ages of 6 and 12 now attend school at no charge. He initiated reform policies in the security sector such as supporting the effective coordination of law enforcement agencies and increasing women presence in the police force.

In 2010, Lamothe was largely responsible for the reconstruction of the country after the devastating earthquake. He was instrumental in relocating approximately 1.6 million people from the resulting tent camps, as well as in removing 97% of the rubble that the earthquake caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2013/01/12/haiti-three-years-after-the-quake-theres-good-news-too/|title=Haiti Three Years After the Quake: There’s Good News, Too|last=Ferreira|first=Tim Padgett with Susana|work=Time|access-date=2017-04-20|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years after the earthquake, kidnappings had decreased by 55 per cent; public investments had increased by 8 per cent; and there were almost 200 projects dedicated to rebuilding of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/01/12/haitian_earthquake_daunting_challenges_remain_four_years_after_disaster.html|title=Haitian earthquake: Daunting challenges remain four years after disaster {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Hurricane Matthew struck Haiti.

Lamothe is working to improve fishing and agriculture in Anse du Clerc so as to help the citizens make sustainable incomes. He has rebuilt a school in Nan Panyol, and is working on many more projects with the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/article-20346-haiti-social-mission-de-la-flgl-pour-relancer-l-economie-de-la-peche-a-anse-du-clerc.html|title=Haïti - Social : Mission de la FLGL pour relancer l'économie de la pêche à Anse du Clerc - HaitiLibre.com : Toutes les nouvelles d’Haiti 7/7|work=HaitiLibre.com|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having grown up in a country affected by poverty and lack of resources at all levels, he developed throughout his life a deep sense of social responsibility and a strong tendency to assist those in need. Lamothe is a pragmatist who, during his time in office, emphasized practical solutions over partisan politics to address the urgent needs of Haiti.

On 14 December 2014, Lamothe resigned his position as Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="reasons"/&gt;

“My Government’s top priority was to serve these vulnerable citizens who had always been forgotten by traditional politicians and the political class.”—Laurent Lamothe, January 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3819">'''Leonard C. Bailey''' (1825–1918) was an African-American business owner and inventor. 

Born into poverty, Bailey initially found work as a barber, building up a string of barber shops in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name="Columbia1901"&gt;{{cite book|author=Union League of the District of Columbia|title=The Twentieth Century Union League Directory: A Compilation of the Efforts of the Colored People of Washington for Social Betterment ...

'''Liam Carroll's''' Zoe Developments group, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], became well known during the [[Celtic Tiger]] years of 1990s and the subsequent property bubble of 2000-2007 for residential and commercial property construction projects. Carroll's wealth was estimated for a time to be in excess of €1 Billion. He later became one of Ireland's leading [[corporate raid]]ers and held large stakes in many public companies for a time (Irish Continental Group, Greencore, FBD Holdings, Jurys Doyle &amp; McInerney Holdings)

In 2000, he started building a stake in listed property developer Dunloe - Ewart. In 2002 he completed his takeover of the company through his investment vehicle Rambridge Ltd for €196.5 million.

Zoe group companies became unable to repay bank borrowings of a reported €1.3bn and in summer 2009 requested [[Examinership]] as protection from creditors, particularly [[ACCBank]] who were the first to seek liquidation of some of his companies.  Following a series of cases, this was rejected by both the High Court and the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0813/1224252497177.html|title=Carroll saga reveals unholy pact between bankers and developers|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=2009-08-13|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the rescue plan described by a judge as ''bordering, if not trespassing on the fanciful'' and the appointment of liquidators to group companies was confirmed by the courts on 14 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/1015/1224256691577.html|title=Liquidator appointed to troubled Zoe group|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=2009-10-15|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Bacon was born in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] on July 25, 1956. His father, Zachary Bacon Jr., founded real estate company Bacon &amp; Co. and later led [[Prudential Financial]]’s and [[Merrill Lynch]]’s real estate efforts in North Carolina.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"&gt;[http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Popups/PrintArticle.aspx?ArticleID=2855575] Louis Bacon: Macro maestro, Stephen Taub, July 1, 2011, Retrieved July 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon graduated from [[Episcopal High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Episcopal High School]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia]]. He attended [[Middlebury College]] in Vermont where he received his BA in American literature, graduating in 1979.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes1/&gt; Bacon met Walter Frank while he was working on a fishing boat on [[Long Island]]. He was given a job clerking at the specialist firm Walter N. Frank &amp; Co during the summers of his college years.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt; He subsequently received his MBA degree in finance at [[Columbia Business School]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE1D61F39F935A25751C0A960948260|title=Cynthia Pigott married to Louis Bacon|publisher=The New York Times|date=February 16, 1986|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Columbia, Bacon traded commodities using a low interest loan he had received. During the first three semesters, he lost money and was forced to borrow money from his father to pay for necessities. He turned a profit during his fourth semester.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.forbes.com/global/2004/1220/072.html|title=Macro Moneymaker|author= Dyan Machan|publisher=[[Forbes]] |date = December 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investment career==
After receiving his [[MBA]], Bacon joined the sales and trading program at [[Bankers Trust]]. Later he left the firm and returned to Walter N. Frank &amp; Co. where he traded currencies. Bacon then got a job on the floor of the [[New York Cotton Exchange]], working as a "runner".&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt; Bacon later worked as a broker and trader of financial futures at [[Lehman Brothers|Shearson Lehman Brothers]] and eventually became the senior vice president for their futures trading division.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atrader.com/manager-profile/31-louis-bacon-hedge-fund-manager|title=Louis Bacon|publisher=atrader.com|date=June 6, 2010|accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Bacon founded Remington Trading Partners and his market insights allowed him to profit during the [[Black Monday (1987)|market crash]] and subsequent rebound.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt; In 1989, Bacon used his middle name in founding [[Moore Capital Management]] LLC and in 1990 created Moore Global Investments using the $25,000 he inherited from his family.&lt;ref name="Institutional Investor"/&gt;

In 2006, ''Forbes'' named Bacon as the 746th richest person in the world,&lt;ref name=forbes1 /&gt; and in 2011 he was listed as the 736th richest man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.forbes.com/wealth/billionaires/list?page=8 |title=The World's Billionaires - Forbes.com |first= |last= |work=forbes.com |year=2011 |accessdate=November 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, the Denver Post reported that his $1.6 billion ranked him as the 238th richest American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_16721010|title=Billionaire Louis Bacon battles to protect his ranch from big utilities' solar-power plans|publisher=Denver Post|date=November 28, 2010|accessdate=December 28, 2011|first=Jason|last=Blevins}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 Forbes Magazine estimated Bacon's net worth to be $1.5 billion and the [[List of billionaires|655th richest person in the world]].&lt;ref name=forbes1&gt;{{cite news | title = Louis Moore Bacon| work = Forbes 400| publisher = [[Forbes magazine]] |date = March 2006| url = https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/10/62UZ.html | accessdate = 2006-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, he purchased [[Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico|Taos Ski Valley]] from the Blake family, who had owned it since 1954.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rohwedder|first1=Cecilie|title=Louis Bacon Tries to Turn Around Taos Ski Valley|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304311204579507651771533522|accessdate=November 25, 2015|work=WSJ|date=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1986 Bacon married Cynthia Pigott,&lt;ref name="nyt1" /&gt; a former ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine staff member whom he later divorced in 2002. They had four children together.&lt;ref name="forbes.com" /&gt;  In 2007, he married Gabrielle Sacconaghi in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23827542-meet-cash-king-louis-bacon-the-richest-hedge-fund-manager-in-london.do|title=Meet cash king Louis Bacon: the richest hedge fund manager in London|date=April 23, 2010|publisher=London Evening Standard|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/fashion/weddings/25sacconaghi.html|title=Weddings and celebrations - Gabrielle Sacconaghi, Louis Bacon|date=February 2, 2007|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, Bacon purchased the Trinchera Ranch in [[Costilla County]], [[Colorado]] from the [[Forbes family]]. The {{convert|171400|acre|km2|adj=on}} property sold for $175 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://origin.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_7577768|title=Conservationist buys state's biggest ranch|last=Hooper|first=Troy|date=November 28, 2007|publisher=[[The Denver Post]]|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Bacon purchased the [[Orton Plantation]] in North Carolina which was built by his ancestor, Roger Moore, son of [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|James Moore]], in 1735.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/whqr/news.newsmain/article/1/0/1646486/Local.Interest/Orton.Plantation.Sold.to.Billionaire|title=Orton Plantation Sold to Billionaire|date=May 6, 2010|publisher=[[WHQR]]|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Bacon obtained [[Austria]]n citizenship due to a special treatment for celebrities who have provided notable achievements for Austria. However this decision is being criticized by certain people because there is no particular achievement known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news.at/a/investigativ-grassers-staatsbuerger-8563047|title=Grassers Staatsbürger|date=December 12, 2017|publisher=news.at|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the [[High Court]] in London granted Bacon a court order to obtain information from the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], ''[[The Denver Post]]'', and [[WordPress]] as to the identities of internet users alleged to have defamed him. Legal experts suggested compliance with the orders was unlikely, given the US tradition of freedom of speech, and the fact that US courts typically required "actual evidence or sufficient allegations of libel" before granting similar orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/09/us-billionaire-wikipedia-defamation|title=US billionaire wins high court order over Wikipedia 'defamation'|last=Halliday|first=Josh|date=May 9, 2011|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/luisakroll/2011/05/10/u-s-law-protects-anonymous-speech-not-billionaires/|title=U.S. Law Protects Anonymous Speech, Not Billionaires|date=May 10, 2011|work=Forbes|author=Luisa Kroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon has been involved in litigation with [[Peter Nygard]], founder of Nygard International, a clothing manufacturer. He contends in multiple lawsuits that Nygard was harming the environment around Clifton Bay, [[Bahamas]], where both have compounds in [[Lyford Cay]]. Bacon also alleges Nygard has engaged in a smear campaign against him. Nygard denies the allegations and contends that Bacon is seeking to improperly acquire Nygard's property and hurt his reputation.

'''Mason Mathews''' (December 15, 1803 - September 16, 1878) was an [[American politician]]. A [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], he was a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] for [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia|Greenbrier County]] during the [[American Civil War]].

Mathews represented Greenbrier County as its Virginia delegate during [[Secession in the United States|secession]] of the [[American South]] and throughout the American Civil War, despite the county being taken into the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] on the formation of [[West Virginia]] in 1863. The seat was abolished from the House at war's end. 

In 1877 his son [[Henry M. Mathews]] was the first ex-Confederate elected to a governorship when he became [[governor of West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Addkison&gt;

In 1871, state rights were returned to former Confederates, allowing the Democratic party to gain control of the West Virginia legislature. [[Henry M.

'''Nubar Sarkis Gulbenkian''' ({{lang-hy| Նուպար Սարգիս Կիւլպէնկեան}}; 2 June 1896 – 10 January 1972) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] business magnate and [[Playboy (lifestyle)|socialite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2726896/A-man-with-a-passion-for-Rollers.html |title=A man with a passion for Rollers |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=14 February 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; born in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empire.

==Early years==
The son of [[Calouste Gulbenkian]], he was born in [[Kadıköy]], [[Ottoman Empire]] but fled from the country when he was a few weeks old due to the [[Hamidian massacres]] of Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gulbenkian|first1=Nubar S.|title=Pantaraxia: The Autobiography of Nubar Gulbenkian|date=1965|publisher=Hutchinson &amp; Company|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsYQAQAAIAAJ|quote=I was their first-born. I was only a few weeks old when we left Kadi Keui and fled from Turkey, for the year 1896 was the time of the Armenian massacres.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken by his father to England, he was educated at [[Harrow School]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and in Germany. He was admitted as a student to the [[Middle Temple]] on 18 October 1917, but was not [[Called to the Bar]]. As a consequence of his educational background Gulbenkian saw himself as British and strove to live up to the model of the English gentleman. As such, during World War II he undertook some amateur sabotage in [[Vichy France]] on behalf of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;N. Gulbenkian, ''Portrait in Oil: The Autobiography of Nubar Gulbenkian'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this he was also attached to the Iranian Embassy in London in an honorary role (as he held Iranian citizenship) whilst he regained his Turkish citizenship in 1965.&lt;ref name="last"&gt;{{cite news  | title = Last of the Big Spenders | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 24 January 1972 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905691,00.html | accessdate =28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This however had helped him during the war as his neutral passport allowed him to cross between France and Spain with little trouble and thus gain access to British intelligence in [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref&gt;Sherri Greene Ottis, ''Silent Heroes: Downed Airmen and the French Underground'', p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[File:1956 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith 'Perspex Roof' motif - Flickr - exfordy.jpg|thumb|Mascot, Gulbenkian's Rolls-Royce]]
Gulbenkian began as an unpaid worker for his father, who was as noted for his miserly tendencies as his son would be for his spending, but later sued his father for $10&amp;nbsp;million, bizarrely after a refusal by the company to allow him $4.50 for a lunch of chicken in [[tarragon]] jelly.&lt;ref name="last"/&gt; Ultimately the incident contributed to Calouste Gulbenkian's decision to leave $420&amp;nbsp;million of his fortune to the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] in Portugal.&lt;ref name="last"/&gt;

Although he ultimately inherited $2.5&amp;nbsp;million from his father, as well as more in a settlement from the Foundation, Gulbenkian also became independently wealthy through his own oil dealings.&lt;ref name="last"/&gt; He was initially the protégé of [[Henri Deterding]] at [[Royal Dutch Shell]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; but later made an independent fortune which allowed him to live a highly extravagant lifestyle.

==Eccentricity==
Gulbenkian's long beard, monocle and the orchid in his buttonhole which was replaced daily led to him becoming noted for a fairly eccentric life, with a number of stories building up around his name. Indeed, his character was summed up by an associate who claimed that "Nubar is so tough that every day he tires out three stockbrokers, three horses and three women".&lt;ref name="last"/&gt; He was a regular face on the international playboy scene.
 
An aficionado of the [[Hackney carriage]], he frequently stated that 'It turns on a [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]], whatever that is!' He even had two [[Austin FX4]] cabs converted to his own specifications and, despite their somewhat bizarre appearance, one of the vehicles sold for £23,000 in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Adams | first = Keith  | title = Specialist conversions | work = Austin Rover Online | date = 17 August 2004 | url = http://austin-rover.co.uk/index.htm?ado6convf.htm | accessdate =28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an early guest on the [[BBC]] series ''[[Face to Face (British TV series)|Face to Face]]'' in 1959, but refused to sign a contract or accept a fee for his appearance. During the interview he attacked the Trustees of the Gulbenkian Foundation in what amounted to virtual slander.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asa Briggs]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0pRGjVGtUvwC&amp;pg=PA170 The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume V]'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Following his appearance, he sued the Corporation to be given a copy of the episode, which he claimed had been promised in lieu of a fee, although the suit was not successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Burnett | first = Hugh  | title = Nubar Gulbenkian interview | work = Memoryshare | publisher = BBC | date = 23 November 2007 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/memoryshare/derby/A29457895 | accessdate =28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known gourmet, he was quoted as saying that 'the best number for a dinner party is two – myself and a damn good head waiter.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nubar Gulbenkian quotes | publisher = ThinkExist.com Quotations | url = http://thinkexist.com/quotes/nubar_gulbenkian/ | accessdate =28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other stories attached to his name include giving his position in life on a [[market research]] form as 'enviable'.

==Personal life==
He was married three times, "I've had good wives, as wives go, and as wives go, two of them went". In 1922, he married Herminia Fejo. In 1928, he married Dora Freeland (aka Doré Plowden) in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QV8M-CGWQ Person Details for Nubar S Gulbenkian]&lt;/ref&gt; He courted Marie Berthe Edmée de Ayala, daughter of the French champagne tycoon [[Louis d'Ayala]], for 14 years before they married in 1948. He had no children.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krebs|first1=Albin|title=Nubar Gulbenkian, Oil Millionaire, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/12/archives/nubar-gulbenkian-oil-millionaire-dies-nubar-gulbenkian-oil.html|accessdate=4 February 2017|work=The New York Times|date=12 January 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived at Arlington House, a block of flats close to London's Ritz Hotel, and at a former rectory in [[Hoggeston]], near Bletchley, Buckinghamshire.&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt;

He died on 10 January 1972 at the English Hospital in [[Cannes]], France, and had lived nearby at his "sumptuous estate" the Domaine des Colles at [[Valbonne]].&lt;ref name="NYTobit" /&gt;

==Will==
Controversy continued to follow him after his death due to the vague nature of his father's [[Will (law)|will]], which appeared to suggest that everybody Nubar was employed by or stayed with during his life should receive some money (See ''[[Re Gulbenkian's Settlements]]'' [1970] AC 553). The case was eventually taken to the [[House of Lords]] before settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Hudson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jkzrDLuWBNIC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=%22nubar+gulbenkian%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=1G0XmuvA5_&amp;sig=c5_s6C9qdj92-wLpcAzlGNrix2k Equity &amp; Trusts]'', p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

'Open to Export' is a free online information service from [[The Institute of Export &amp; International Trade]], dedicated to helping small UK businesses get ready to export and expand internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opentoexport.com/info/about/|title=Open to Export - About Us &amp; Our Service|website=opentoexport.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides webinars and articles covering five different stages of international trade: 'Getting started', 'Selecting a market', 'Reaching customers', 'Pricing and getting paid' and 'Delivery and documentation'.

== Export Action Plan ==
The 'Export Action Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opentoexport.com/info/export-action-plan/|title=Open to Export - Export Action Plan Information|website=opentoexport.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;' is an online planning tool on Open to Export that allows businesses to take ownership of their international strategy. It asks companies to answer questions and set actions along the five different steps to export success, from getting started to delivery and documentation. Once completed, the company can download a PDF report of their export strategy, which they can take to their bank, adviser, or submit to Open to Export's quarterly competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opentoexport.com/info/export-action-plan-competition/|title=Open to Export - Export Action Plan Competition Info|website=opentoexport.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Export Action Plan Competitions ===
Open to Export runs quarterly competitions encouraging businesses to complete their 'Export Action Plans'. 10 finalists are invited to a showcase final, with one winner being selected by a panel of expert judges to win a cash prize and further support prizes towards the implementation of their plans. 

Open to Export has run eight UK-only competitions and one global competition - the 'Open to Export International Business Awards'. The Open to Export International Business Awards were run with the support of the World Trade Organisation and the International Chamber of Commerce. The Institute of Export &amp; International Trade were named a 'Small Business Champion' by the WTO and ICC upon the completion of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news18_e/sbc_04oct18_e.htm|title=WTO and ICC announce new Small Business Champion|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 10th Export Action Plan competition was opened in November 2019 and companies have until January 25th to enter.

== History ==
The site launched in beta in May 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kevin|last=Coleman|title=Alliantus gets early invite from Open to Export|url=http://www.alliantus.com/mini-blog/alliantus-gets-early-invite-from-open-to-export/|publisher=Alliantus|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; during this time Open to Export limited the business sectors to technology, and the overseas markets to the US and India. 

The site officially launched in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UKTI|title=Online service for small businesses launched|url=http://www.ukti.gov.uk/pt_pt/export/howwehelp/item/396500.html?null|publisher=UKTI|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Abigail|last=Van-West|title=UKTI launches free online service to boost international trade|url=http://www.growingbusiness.co.uk/ukti-launches-free-online-service-to-boost-international-trade.html|publisher=Growing Business|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of launch Lord Green, then Minister of State for Trade and Investment, said: "Supporting more small and medium-sized enterprises to export is a key part of the government's plan for growth,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Telegraph|title=Better Future for Britain in the pipeline|url=http://jobs.telegraph.co.uk/article/4081309/better-future-for-britain-in-the-pipeline/|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=10 December 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to say "Half of the UK's exports, by value, already come from SMEs. Open to Export will provide practical assistance, advice and support to other businesses looking to make that crucial first step to sell into foreign markets." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rachel|last= Miller|title=Also in the news this week — 2nd November 2012|url=http://www.startupdonut.co.uk/news/startup/also-in-the-news-this-week-2nd-november-2012|publisher=Startup Donut|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of Open to Export was taken on by the Institute of Export &amp; International Trade in April 2017.

'''Perceptual mapping''' is a [[diagram]]matic technique used by asset [[marketing|marketers]] that attempts to visually display the perceptions of customers or potential customers. Typically the [[positioning (marketing)|position]] of a company's [[product (business)|product]], [[product line]], or [[brand]] is displayed relative to their competition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mccarthy, E. J., Mcguiggan, I. R., Perreault, D. W., &amp; Quester, G. P. (2007). ''Marketing: Creating and delivering value.'' Australia, Sydney: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; '''Perceptual maps''', also known as '''market maps''', usually have two dimensions but can be multi-dimensional; they can be used to identify gaps in the market and potential partners or merger targets as well as to clarify perceptual problems with a company's product.

Perceptual mapping enables companies to better understand their customers: the who, why, where, how and what of their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drucker|first1=Peter F|title=The Practice of Management|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0750685042|page=x Foreword|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brassington|first1=Frances|last2=Pettitt|first2=Stephen|title=Essentials of Marketing|date=2013|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow|isbn=9780273728139|page=243|edition=3|language=English|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jobber|first1=David|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Principles and Practice of Marketing|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Maidenhead|isbn=9780077140007|page=290|edition=7|language=English|format=Paperback|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feintzeig|first1=Rachel|title=Business News: Holiday Stress for Businesses|publisher=Wall Street Journal (Europe edition)|date=24 December 2015|page=B2|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Holman W Jr|title=The Broadband Future And Its Enemies|publisher=Wall Street Journal (Europe edition)|date=19 November 2015|location=New York|page=A.10|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If a business is perceived in a manner they find unsatisfactory, further research then identifies what can be done to change that. Perceptual mapping also allows businesses to see what consumers think of other brands, particularly their competitors. Regular uses of the maps can help track  preferences, and see changes as they happen. Perceptual mapping can help define market segments, showing clusters of businesses differentiated by key aspects (such as higher class or number of restaurants). Within the clusters found in perceptual maps of entire industries, a business can classify potential partners or possible businesses to merge with, since the clustering of brands signifies the similarity in businesses, meaning they have corresponding attributes. It can also help identify gaps in a market where a new product or service could be introduced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Perceptual maps can also be used to help keep track of how a new product, such as a recently introduced smartphone, is being viewed in a specific market. It is important to see that the way a business is marketing its product is not only successful, but successful in a manner that aligns with the business’s overarching goal for positioning.

Some companies seem to have fallen out of favor with the public, such as Quicken Loans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudegeair|first1=Peter|title=At Quicken Loans, a Will to Do Battle|publisher=Wall Street Journal (Europe edition)|date=16 June 2015|page=25|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and VW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anonymous|title=A mucky business; The Volkswagen scandal|issue=416.8957|publisher=The Economist|date=26 September 2015|pages=23–25|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptual mapping can help elicit the extent of the damage.

== Limitations ==
There are many limitations to perceptual mapping. The largest is the number of variables used. Traditionally, the map uses two variables and does not account for others. This assumption can hinder the reliability of results, as in some cases, it is not safe to assume that there are only two major factors influencing the decision of purchase for a consumer. For example, a graph may use quality of food and pricing, but not take into account other relevant variables such as the number of visits and locations. Also, there is often a blurred line between what a business can offer and what a consumer thinks the business can offer. This could be due to miscommunication, lack of knowledge, impact from social media, and so on. These untruths can influence the result, creating a slight bias in the statistics. Another limitation is data gathering. The data needed to form a perceptual map is usually obtained through surveys, and can be difficult to obtain. The range of behaviours that the map covers is also a constraint, as the limitation to two variables means that its application works mainly with purchase decisions made with little thought and effort, such as purchasing a beverage at a store or going to a fast food restaurant.

== Examples ==
Perceptual maps can have any number of dimensions but the most common is two dimensions. The first perceptual map below shows consumer perceptions of various [[automobile]]s on the two dimensions of sportiness/conservative and classy/affordable. This sample of consumers felt [[Porsche]] was the sportiest and classiest of the cars in the study (top right corner). They felt [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] was most practical and conservative (bottom left corner).

[[Image:PerceptualMap1.png|center|frame|Perceptual map of competing products]]

Cars that are positioned close to each other are seen as similar on the relevant dimensions by the consumer. For example, consumers see Buick, Chrysler, and Oldsmobile as similar. They are close competitors and form a competitive grouping. A company considering the introduction of a new model will look for an area on the map free from competitors. Some perceptual maps use different-sized circles to indicate the sales volume or market share of the various competing products.

Displaying consumers’ perceptions of related products is only half the story. Many perceptual maps also display consumers’ ideal points. These points reflect ideal combinations of the two dimensions as seen by a consumer. The next diagram shows a study of consumers’ ideal points in the alcohol/spirits product space. Each dot represents one respondent's ideal combination of the two dimensions. Areas where there is a cluster of ideal points (such as A) indicate a [[market segment]]. Areas without ideal points are sometimes referred to as demand voids.

[[Image:PerceptualMap2.png|center|frame|Perceptual map of ideal points and clusters]]

A company considering introducing a new product will look for areas with a high density of ideal points. They will also look for areas without competitive rivals. This is best done by placing both the ideal points and the competing products on the same map.

Some maps plot ideal vectors instead of ideal points. The map below displays various aspirin products as seen on the dimensions of effectiveness and gentleness. It also shows two ideal vectors. The slope of the ideal vector indicates the ratio of the two dimensions preferred by those consumers within that segment. This study indicates that there is one segment that is more concerned with effectiveness than harshness, and another segment that is more interested in gentleness than strength.

== Other types of mapping ==
=== Spidergrams ===
Spidergrams are an alternative to perceptual mapping that similarly are visual marketing tools; however, spidergrams also request customers to rate attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jobber|first1=David|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Principles and Practice of Marketing|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Maidenhead|isbn=9780077140007|page=291|edition=7|language=English|format=Paperback|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multidimensional perceptual maps ===
[[File:Multi-Dimensional Perceptual Map.gif|thumb|Example of a multi-dimensional perceptual map]]
Traditional perceptual maps are built with two visual dimensions (X and Y axis). Multidimensional perceptual maps are built with more dimensions visualised as profile charts in small map regions, and then items are mapped to the regions by their similarity to the vectors that represent the region. A common technique to construct this kind of multidimensional perceptual maps is the [[self-organizing map]]. This helps pinpoint more variables, allowing for more in-depth research into what influences the consumer. This means that the perceptual map can be applied beyond low-involvement purchases, and also helps with identification of segments in a market.

=== Intuitive maps ===
Perceptual maps need not come from a detailed study. There are also intuitive maps (also called judgmental maps or consensus maps) that are created by marketers based on their understanding of their industry. These are limited by not being based on consumer data.

When detailed marketing research studies are done methodological problems can arise, but at least the information is coming directly from the consumer. An assortment of statistical procedures can be used to convert the raw data collected in a survey into a perceptual map. [[Preference regression (in marketing)|Preference regression]] will produce ideal vectors. [[Multi dimensional scaling (in marketing)|Multi dimensional scaling]] will produce either ideal points or competitor positions. [[Factor analysis]], [[discriminant analysis (in marketing)|discriminant analysis]], [[cluster analysis (in marketing)|cluster analysis]] and [[logit analysis (in marketing)|logit analysis]] can also be used. Some techniques are constructed from perceived differences between products, others from perceived similarities, and still others from [[Cross elasticity of demand|cross price elasticity of demand]] data from electronic scanners.

==Modern techniques==

Marketers can reveal shoppers' collective perceptual map with increasing precision and detail by aggregating and analysing their data; this is done, for example, in the smartphone and laptop industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Anthony JT|last2=Sun|first2=Chih-Yuan|last3=Yang|first3=Fu-Chen|last4=Chen|first4=Chao-Hung|last5=Wang|first5=Chun-Sheng|title=Mining perceptual maps from consumer reviews|journal=Decision Support Systems|date=2016|volume=82|issue=February|pages=12–25|doi=10.1016/j.dss.2015.11.002|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|language=English|issn=0167-9236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zaribaf|first1=Mehdi|last2=Shameli|first2=Nora|title=Notebook Positioning by Perceptual Map and Laddering Method|journal=New Marketing Research Journal |date=Fall 2012 |volume=2 |issue=3|pages=121–134|publisher=University of Isfahan, Iran|language=Persian|issn=2228-7744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, they can be used in non-commercial applications, such as identifying factors involved in dangerous driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanlaar |first1=Ward |last2=Simpson |first2=Herb |last3=Robertson |first3=Robyn|title=A perceptual map for understanding concern about unsafe driving behaviours |journal=Accident Analysis and Prevention |date=2008 |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=1667–1673|doi=10.1016/j.aap.2008.05.009|publisher=Elsevier B.V. |language=English |issn=0001-4575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Plant Engineering''''' ({{ISSN|0032-082X}}) is a trade publication and web site owned by CFE Media.  It covers the field of plant engineering and maintenance in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries. Since 1947, plant engineers, maintenance supervisors and manufacturing leaders have turned to ''Plant Engineering'' for the information they needed to run their plants smarter, safer, faster, and better. ''Plant Engineering's'' editors stay on top of the latest trends in manufacturing at every corner of the plant floor. The major content areas include electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, automation engineering and facility maintenance and plant management.
Every November issue, ''Plant Engineering'' announces the [http://www.plantengineering.com/events-and-awards/product-of-the-year.html Product of the Year]. In the December issue, they announce the [http://www.plantengineering.com/events-and-awards/top-plant.html Top Plant], which honors the best manufacturing facilities.

In April 2010, former owner [[Reed Business Information]] announced the magazine would close.  However later that month, ''[[Control Engineering (magazine)|Control Engineering]]'', ''[[Consulting-Specifying Engineer]]'' and ''Plant Engineering'' were acquired by a new company, CFE Media.

==Biography==
Repass is a native of Charleston, West Virginia and a 1976 graduate of Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia. He was a member of the Young Thundering Herd football team &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/sports/marshall_plane_crash/the_young_herd/young-herd-hopes-fans-stick-by-team/article_049ef245-cd43-5f54-800b-df602746a15b.html|title=Young Herd hopes fans stick by team|last=Herald-Dispatch|first=The|work=The Herald-Dispatch|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1970s following the tragic plane crash &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/multimedia/photo_galleries/gallery-marshall-s-young-thundering-herd-victory-against-xavier-sept/article_79316c63-af72-505d-9e40-af046ae1ff3b.html|title=Gallery: Marshall's Young Thundering Herd victory against Xavier, Sept. 25, 1971|last=Herald-Dispatch|first=The|work=The Herald-Dispatch|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that claimed the lives of 75 players, coaches, athletic administrators, and team boosters. In 1994, Repass was elected to Marshall's W. Page Pitt School of Journalism &amp; Mass Communications Hall of Fame for his contribution to media and public opinion research.

In 1977, Repass received a master of science degree in communications from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, with a special emphasis in public opinion and advertising research.

In 1980, Repass developed The West Virginia Poll for the [[Charleston Daily Mail]], WSAZ Television and The [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name="wvpoll"&gt;[http://www.wcwv.org/newsletter_archives/2006_newsletters/newsletter_vol_3_num_5_may01_2006.pdf Wellness Council of West Virginia], accessed November 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The West Virginia Poll was the first media sponsored scientific measurement of [[public opinion]] in West Virginia. The West Virginia Poll continues to this day and is sponsored &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wvmetronews.com/2014/08/29/wv-poll-shows-capito-up-17/|title=WV Poll shows Capito up 17|date=2014-08-29|website=WV MetroNews|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[West Virginia MetroNews|MetroNews Radio Network]].

In 1988, Repass moved his research practice from Charleston, West Virginia to MarketVision Research Inc. in Cincinnati, Ohio where he was president of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/06/06/fin_blue_ash_firm_leads.html|title=Blue Ash firm leads Internet study|website=www.enquirer.com|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he sold his interest in MarketVision and formed what became R.L. Repass &amp; Partners Inc.

Today Repass and the Research America Inc. organization provide survey research and strategic consulting services to [[Fortune 500]] corporations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.repassinc.com/our-work|title=REPASS Research and Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=REPASS, Inc.|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; state and national trade [[Trade association|associations]], and governmental agencies. He has also directed [[Public Opinion Research|public opinion]] and [[market research]] for media clients including [[The Arizona Republic]], The Sunday Examiner-Chronicle in San Francisco, [[Poynter Institute|The Poynter Institute]] for Media Studies, [[Thomson Reuters]] and more than 40 newspapers and media companies in the United States and Canada.

Repass is a member of the [[American Association for Public Opinion Research]].

'''Richard L. "Dick" Barclay''' (born June 5, 1937) is a [[Certified Public Accountant]] in [[Rogers, Arkansas|Rogers]], a city in [[Benton County, Arkansas|Benton County]] in the northwestern corner of [[Arkansas]], [[United States]], who was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[Arkansas House of Representatives]] from December 31, 1976 to December 31, 1992. He was also the director of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration under Republican [[governor of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Mike Huckabee|Michael Dale "Mike" Huckabee]]. In 1992, he lost a [[primary election]] for the [[United States House of Representatives]] to then fellow State Representative [[Tim Hutchinson]] of [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], the seat of government of Benton County.

Barclay was born in [[Oberlin, Kansas|Oberlin]] in [[Decatur County, Kansas|Decatur County]] in northwestern [[Kansas]]. He began work as an accountant in 1961 and is a partner in the firm  Beall, Barclay, and Company. He is a member of the Arkansas Society of Certified Public Accountants and of the American Institute of Certified  Public Accountants. He is a director of the Federal Savings Bank in Rogers and United Bank. He is a former vice president of the Arkansas State [[Chamber of Commerce]]. He is also a member of the [[board of directors]] of the Brokers National Life Assurance Company. He is one of sixteen commissioners of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission.

In 2000, Barclay was elected president of the Arkansas Society of CPAs. That same year, he was named "Arkansas Business Person of the Year" by [[Beta Gamma Sigma]] of [[Sam Walton]] College of the [[University of Arkansas]] in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]]. [[Mack McLarty]], a former chief of staff to [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]], won this honor in 2007.

Barclay was [[executive director]] of Legislative Affairs and Budget until tapped by Huckabee in 1999 to head Finance and Administration. He left state employment in the spring of 2002 to return to his business in Rogers and was succeeded by Richard A. Weiss, who left the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality to take the Finance and Administration position.

Barclay did not seek a ninth two-year term in the Arkansas House in 1992. Instead, he ran for the Third Congressional District seat opened by the retirement of longtime Republican [[incumbent]] [[John Paul Hammerschmidt]]. However, he lost the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] nomination to Tim Hutchinson, who would serve in the U.S. House from 1993 to 1997 and in the [[United States Senate]] from 1997 to 2003.

In 2003, Barclay served as chairman of the Benton County Republican Party. He is married to Jan K. Barclay. He is a member of the [[Disciples of Christ]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The Group`s investment portfolio embraces activities of real estate development, retail sales, commercial and industrial space management\ services, mining and metallurgy industry, customer financing, est. Actually part of BALFIN Group are more than 18 companies; geographically the Group is present in  7 countries, employing more than 3,000 people.

==Biography==
Mane was born in the southern Albanian city of [[Korça]] on 24 December 1967. He was a student of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131021161154/http://www.upt.al/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=29&amp;lang=en Faculty of Geology and Mining at Tirana University] when the communist system in Albania collapsed. In this new social, economical and political situation he emigrated in [[Austria]] looking for a better life.  
Mane started working as a translator, helping himself to create contacts with the business world too. Whilst living in [[Austria]] in 1993, he spotted the opportunity to start business with electronic products and home appliances in Albania.
In 2008 he was included in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' top four "people to watch in business" in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7e2cad2a-fa18-11dc-9b7c-000077b07658.html#axzz3O9TS6WZx |title=People to watch in business |work=Financial Times |date=2008-03-27 |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alba Trade and Neptun==
The beginnings of Mane's business activities started in 1993 in Vienna, where Mane founded [http://balfin.al/page.php?m=albatrade Alba Trade]. Having started with the trade of electronic devices, soon the Balfin Group, created by Mane managed to create the largest network of electronics stores in Albania, Neptun and then extending the network in the neighboring countries as well. [http://www.neptun.al Neptun]'s chain of stores was positioned from the beginning in 1993 as the main electronics player in the Albanian market supplying the demand with the best brands and latest technology. Today this business created by Mane counts 28 stores in Albania and more than 27 in Kosova, Montenegro, Macedonia and Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oranews.tv/vendi/neptun-me-dyqan-te-ri-tek-cristal-center-oferta-per-te-gjithe-te-interesuarit/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mane TCI==
Since 2002 Balfin Group is present in development and real estate management projects. Through the company [http://www.manetci.com.al/new/ Mane TCI] it has realized industrial and residential facilities of the highest standards in Albania such as [http://rollinghills.al/ Rolling Hills], Ambasador 1, 2, 3, etc, or the well known shopping centers such as TEG or QTU.

==QTU, Euromax, Fashion Group==
In 2005, it was inaugurated the first shopping center in Albania, [http://www.qtu.al Qendra Tregtare Univers] (Universe Trade Center). This was a very ambitious project of Mane's for the time and revolutionized the purchasing way of the Albanian customers. Even today [http://www.qtu.al/historiku QTU] is still one of the most popular and successful shopping centers in Albania.

The year 2005 marked the establishment of the first Albanian chain of supermarkets, Euromax. In a very short time Euromax managed to turn into the largest network of supermarkets in Albania offering quality with the best prices.

[http://balfin.al/struktura-e-grupit/tregtia-me-pakice/fashion-group/ Fashion Group] was established in 2005 to bring in Albania the most popular brands of clothing, offering the latest collections for all Brands of Fashion Group are: Mango, Goldenpoint, Calliope, Geox, Parfois, Okaidi, Prenatal, Terranova, Springfield, Carpisa and Etam.

==TEG==
In 2011 Balfin Group completed another important project, [http://teg.al/ Tirana East Gate]. With an investment of €54 million, it was constructed the most modern and the largest shopping center in Albania with over 90'000 m2.

==Skopje City Mall, Honorary Consul of Thailand, Tirana Logistic Park==
In October 2012 Balfin Group concluded one of the most important investments of the group abroad, [http://www.skopjecitymall.mk/ Skopje City Mall]. This €68 million project was developed in cooperation with the participation of [http://www.ebrd.com/ international partners].

In March 2012 he was named the [[honorary consul]] of [[Thailand]] at the opening ceremony of the new [[consulate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkanweb.com/shqiperi/2685/zamir-mane-konsull-nderi-i-tajlandes-ne-shqiperi-85272.html |title=Zamir Mane, konsull nderi i Tajlandës në Shqipëri |publisher=Balkanweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again during 2012 Mane with Balfin Group undertook a bold project yet again, building a logistic park, which is another groundbreaking innovation for the Albanian market. [http://tlp.al/ [[Tirana logistic park|Tirana Logistic Park]]] is designed to provide services not only to Albanian businesses, but also the foreign. [https://web.archive.org/web/20131021163759/http://www.pie-mag.com/articles/4037/albania-s-balfin-starts-tirana-logistics-park-in-capital/ This investment] will be developed in phases and the first phase was finalized in October 2013. The total investment costs are planned to be about €44 million.

==[[AlbChrome]]==
In 2013 Balfin Group took a very important step to diversify the portfolio of activities in the mineral industry by acquiring 100% of the shares of [http://albchrome.al/ ACR Holding], the largest company of extraction, enrichment and processing of chrome in Albania.

Mane has created the most successful Group in Albania with more than 4,000 employees.

== Green Coast ==
In 2015, Mane started building, Green Coast, which is among the most luxurious compounds among the Albanian Coast, containing ten types of buildings, from elite villas to apartments, including a 5 star hotel. This project is taken on by [http://www.manetci.com.al/new/ Mane TCI] .

== Spar and Interspar ==
In 2016 Mane and Balfin Group turned all the Carrefour in Albania, into Spars and Interspars. This is a Dutch brand, founded on 1932 and is currently present in more than 42 countries around the world.

==Controversy==
Mane has been subject to strong controversy from Albanian activists, due to his strong political connections, which have allowed him to profit massively in different areas of business.

==Life==
Seng was born in [[Fengshun]], [[Meizhou]], [[Guangdong]] to Chao Saekhu.&lt;ref name="ASTV"/&gt; Seng came to [[Thailand|Siam]] in the 1860s together with his parents and second brother. However, as Seng's mother and second brother soon fell ill shortly arriving in Siam, his parents and brother returned to China, leaving Seng in the care of a local acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2006-11-20/163010550437s.shtml 他信祖籍地：丰顺县塔下村] 2006年11月20日16:30 金羊网-羊城晚报, retrieved 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Seng spent his early years in Chanthaburi where he met his wife, a native Thai by the name of Thongdi. Their eldest son, Chiang was born in 1890 around this time and Seng started his career as a tax farmer in this small town.&lt;ref&gt;Baker et al (2009), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; When the land lease expired in 1900, Seng and his family moved to [[Talat Noi]] in Bangkok around 1900 where worked as a commercial trader. Seng and his family relocated to [[Chiang Mai]] around 1908 to resume his career as a tax farmer under the patronage of Nikhon Jinkit.&lt;ref&gt;Baker et al (2009), p. 27-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Seng married two wives; the first to Thongdi with whom he had 6 children, including Chiang. Thongdi died of a heart attack in 1910 due to a robbery incident, and Seng remarried another lady, Nocha with whom he had 3 children. Chiang married another Thai lady, Saeng Samana with whom they have 12 children.&lt;ref&gt;Baker et al (2009), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang's second child and oldest son, Sak Shinawatra, adopted the Shinawatra surname in 1938, during [[Plaek Pibulsonggram]]'s anti-Chinese campaigns, and the rest of the clan followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Baker et al (2009), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Sak Shinawatra became an army general and has four sons who all served in the army for at least sometime. Sak's third son, [[Chaiyasit Shinawatra]] became the commander-in-chief of the [[Royal Thai Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker et al (2009), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang's 4th child and second son, Loet Shinawatra is the father of [[Prime Ministers of Thailand|Prime Ministers]] [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] and [[Yingluck Shinawatra]]. Loet served as an MP for Chiang Mai in 1969 and 1976 for the [[Thai Nation Party]]. Loet married Yindi Ramingwong, who is the daughter of a Hakka Chinese immigrant and his wife, a princess of the Lanna royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.people.com.cn/200507/03/eng20050703_193730.html |title=Thai PM concludes China tour |newspaper=People's Daily Online; Xinhua |date=July 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsm.com.cn/news/2005/0701/68/596.shtml |script-title=zh:泰国总理他信：我是华裔客家人 |trans-title=Thai Prime Minister: 'I am Hakka Chinese' |date=July 1, 2005 |work=Overseas Chinese Network |publisher=中国侨网|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sharing'''  is the joint use of a resource or space. In its narrow sense, it refers to joint or alternating use of inherently finite goods, such as a common [[pasture]] or a shared residence. It is also the process of dividing and distributing. Apart from obvious instances, which we can observe in human activity, we can also find many examples of this happening in nature. When an organism takes in nutrition or oxygen for instance, its internal organs are designed to divide and distribute the energy taken in, to supply parts of its body that need it. Flowers divide and distribute their seeds. In a broader sense, it can also include free granting of use rights to goods that can be treated as [[Rivalry (economics)|nonrival goods]], such as information. Still more loosely, "sharing" can actually mean giving something as an outright gift: for example, to "share" one's food really means to give some of it as a gift. Sharing is a basic component of human interaction, and is responsible for strengthening social ties and ensuring a person’s well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poquérusse|first=Jessie|title=The Neuroscience of Sharing|url=https://www.uniiverse.com/neuroscience|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In a market==
Market sharing occurs when competitors agree to divide or allocate customers, suppliers or territories among themselves rather than allowing competitive market forces to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/business/anti-competitive-behaviour/cartels/market-sharing#market-sharing|title=Market sharing|last=Commission|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|date=2013-01-09|work=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market sharing can include:

* allocating customers by geographic area
* dividing contracts by value within an area

Also agreeing not to:

* compete for established customers
* produce each other’s products or services
* expand into a competitor’s market

Market sharing is generally an illegal practice as it violates anti-trust laws and the basic principles of the free market. Market sharing mainly occur in the form of cartels like the [[Guadalajara_Cartel|Guadalajara Cartel]], which was the first Mexican drug cartel to consolidate the production and supply of illegal marijuana into a single organization.

Sharing in a market may also refer to the temporary or permanent transfer of information and other physical as well as intellectual property, but this is generally accompanied by the exchange of money.{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
==In households==
[[File:Green sharing (1).jpg|thumb|Plant sharing]]
Resource sharing - called kaláka in Hungarian -  is an old tradition in Hungary. Young couples had to build their house after marriage.  Marriage itself was called házasodás in Hungarian (en: becoming the owner of a house). When doing so the whole community, relatives and acquaintances helped the young couple with work, knowledge and even money. At pigsticking, all members of the community got their shares too.  Superfluous plants were freely distributed for neighbours in the season.

In most cultures, members of the same household tend to pool their resources.

==In computer and Internet culture==
{{main|Image sharing|File sharing}}
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
[[File sharing]] is the practice of distributing or providing access to digitally stored information, such as computer programs, multi-media (audio, video), documents, or electronic books. It may be implemented through a variety of ways. Storage, transmission, and distribution models are common methods of file sharing incorporate manual sharing using [[removable media]], centralized computer file server installations on [[computer network]]s, [[World Wide Web]]-based [[hyperlink]]ed documents, and the use of distributed [[peer-to-peer networking]] (see [[peer-to-peer file sharing]]).

Sharing is a key feature in the developing field of [[free software]] and [[open source software]], with implications for economics. This is leading to a need to review [[licensing]], [[patents]] and [[copyright]], and to [[controversy]] in these areas, as well as new approaches like [[Creative Commons]] and the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].

Furthermore, sharing is a key feature of [[Internet culture]] in which images, videos, links, knowledge and other content are shared on [[Web 2.0]]-platforms such as [[reddit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nms.sagepub.com/content/15/2/167 John, Nicholas A. (2013) Sharing and Web 2.0: The emergence of a keyword. New Media &amp; Society, March 2013 vol. 15 no. 2 167-182]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herman|first1=Andrew|last2=Hadlaw|first2=Jan|last3=Swiss|first3=Thom|title=Theories of the Mobile Internet: Materialities and Imaginaries|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317911128|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BFucBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer science==
In [[computer science]], the issue of handling [[shared resource]]s figures prominently. For example, [[time-sharing]] is an approach to [[interactive computing]] in which a single [[computer]] is used to provide apparently simultaneous interactive general-purpose computing to multiple users by sharing processor time. Sharing of resources between [[Process (computer science)|processes]] and [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] is the source of most of the difficulties of [[concurrent programming]]. The word "sharing" is also used in some [[functional programming]] communities to refer specifically to sharing of memory between different data items to save space, otherwise known as [[hash consing]].

==In religions==

===Information and knowledge===
* The KJV Bible, [[s:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 13|1 Corinthians 13:2]] says that '''having all the knowledge in the world is useless, without the desire for charity (sharing).'''
* The Douay-Rheims Bible, [http://drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=57&amp;ch=1&amp;l=9#x Philippians 1:9] says "'''And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding'''".
* In editions of the Christian Bible, [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Hosea#4|Hosea 4:6]] says that '''obstruction of the flow of knowledge could be the destruction of mankind.'''
* '''Vidya Daan''' ({{lang|sa|विद्या दान}}) translated as '''Knowledge Charity''', a concept in [[Dāna|Daan]], is a [[Niyama|tenet]] of all [[Indian religions|Dharmic]] religions that also values the sharing of Knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit.us/vidya.html Sanskrit slokas about Vidya]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vidyadaan.in/about/ Vidya Daan: about]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gyan yoga''', '''[[Jnana yoga]]''' ({{lang|sa|ज्ञान योग}}) translated as '''Wisdom Exercise''' or '''Knowledge Path''', is the '''sacred search for True Knowledge''', in all Dharmic religions.
* In Hinduism, [[Vidya|Right Knowledge]] is a form of God, and anything that Knowledge is written on or recorded on is considered sacred, to be protected from obscurity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|sa|अपूर्व: कोपि कोशोयं विद्यते तव भारति ।&lt;br/&gt;व्ययतो वॄद्धिम् आयाति क्षयम् आयाति संचयात् ॥}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:* Translation: '''Oh Goddess [[Saraswati]], your treasure of knowledge ([[Vidya]]) is indeed very amazing! If used (shared) it grows and if unused (obscured) it shrinks!'''
*In Islam, [[Muhammad]] said: "'''Wisdom is the lost property of the faithful; wherever he finds it he has the right to take it'''"&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Tirmidhi Tradition:4159, Sunan Ibn Majah Tradition:9784, Ibid Tradition:9785, Mishkat al-Masabih Tradition:216&lt;/ref&gt;
:Muhammad also said: "'''Whoever is asked about a knowledge that he knows about and then hides it and keeps it away, he will be bridled on the day of judgement with a bridle of fire.'''"&lt;ref&gt;Related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and Al-Tirmidhi&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">'''Sigma''' (Science in General Management) was a [[limited company]] established by [[Henry Novy]], [[Stafford Beer]] and [[Roger Eddison]] in 1961. It sold [[operational research]] OR in the [[United Kingdom]] and overseas. Beer was responsible for the cybernetic models of organisation and corporate planning which were the firm's specially. Eddison was the Operations Director.

The consultancy arose following discussions between the Société d’Économie et de Mathématiques Appliquées (SEMA) and Martech Consultants Limited. Novy, who ran Maretch, was given the job of selecting the people to run the company, inviting several OR practitioners to come to Paris for an interview. After he selected Beer, Beer only agreed if Eddison would also join him. This was arranged and the company was launched with a reception at the [[Connaught Hotel]] in October 1961.&lt;ref name="Beer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beer |first1=Stafford |title=Roger Tatham Eddison: an appreciation |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |date=August 2000 |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=1004–1007 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600989 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600989 |accessdate=29 September 2018 |language=en |issn=0160-5682}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Over the next five years Sigma developed into a substantial organisation providing services to several leading companies across the UK as well as for six government departments. It also took on contracts in the United States and several developing countries. Amongst the diverse areas it worked in were energy, for the [[Gas Council]], transportation, for [[British Rail]] and the [[Port of London Authority]], shipbuilding, for the [[Geddes Committee]], education for [[Yugoslavia]], tourism, for [[Israel]], nationalised industry in South America, and distribution for a variety of industrial firms.&lt;ref name="GCF"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cabezas Fuentealba|first1=Guido|title=Beer|url=http://www.oocities.org/gicabezas/Beer.html|website=www.oocities.org|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sigma, Martech, and Proplan were amalgamated to form what afterwards became the Metra Consulting Group in the United Kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2591">'''Small Rockets''' was a British computer game developer located in Guildford, England. The company was founded in October 2000 and created and sold PC games online.

== History ==
Small Rockets was born from the ashes of [[Fiendish Games]], a department of [[Criterion Games]] (also known as Criterion Software), that was started to test the waters for delivering games online rather than through traditional retail channels. When Fiendish Games was shut down, the then head of department Jonathan Small set up Small Rockets to continue where Fiendish Games had left off. The company licensed the games created by Fiendish Games from Criterion, and most of the Fiendish Games employees moved with Jonathan to the new company.

In addition to its commercial games Small Rockets also produced a bespoke 'one off' game called 'HP Spy Academy' for a [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] exhibition at 'Stuff Live' in 2002.

Work continued on several more PC titles and a Game Boy Advance title until most of the employees had to be let go, largely for financial reasons, in 2003.

Due to the increasing costs of running a UK-registered limited-liability company from the US, the decision was made in 2012 to shut the company down. The Small Rockets website displayed a formal notice of the shutdown from early July 2012, at which point the site's shop was also disabled. Full shutdown of the Small Rockets servers (including the website itself) occurred in late August 2012. Jonathan has stated that he hopes to continue Small Rockets' ''Red Ace'' franchise.

'''St. James' Roman Catholic Church''' is located at 32 James Street between St. James Place and Madison Street in the [[Two Bridges, Manhattan|Two Bridges]] neighborhood of [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second oldest Roman Catholic building in the city, built in 1835-37 of [[fieldstone]], with a pair of [[Doric order|Doric]] columns flanking the entrance.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;  While the [[Neo-classical architecture|neo-Classical]] church is modeled on the published designs by [[Minard Lefever]], and is sometimes attributed to him, there is no hard evidence of this being true.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;&lt;ref name=fromatoz&gt;{{cite fromatoz}}, p.210-11&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was once topped by a domed [[cupola]].&lt;ref name=fromatoz /&gt;

==History==
The parish was established by [[John Dubois|Bishop John Dubois]] in order to relieve the overcrowding at [[St. Peter Catholic Church (Manhattan)|St. Peter's]] on Barclay Street. He purchased an Episcopal church building on Ann Street, retaining the name of Christ Church, and asked Father [[Félix Varela]] to organize a congregation. Fr. Varela also established a free school. In October 1833, it was discovered that nearby excavation had rendered Christ Church unsound. Pending the completion of a new building on James Street, premises were rented at 33 Ann Street. However, some members of the congregation finding this too far uptown, instead purchased the Reformed Presbyterian church on Chambers Street. This would become the parish of the [[Church of the Transfiguration, Roman Catholic (Manhattan)|Transfiguration]], with Fr. Varela as the first pastor.&lt;ref name=Lafort&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KL4YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA396#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lafort, Remigius. ''The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X'', Catholic editing Company, 1914, p. 336]{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Mass was said in the basement of the James St. church on September 18, 1836. The following January it was dedicated under the invocation of St. James the Apostle, by Bishop Dubois. [[Andrew Byrne]] was appointed rector. Byrne was succeeded in 1842 by Rev. John Maginnis, who was in turn followed by Rev. John N. Smith. In 1848 Fr. Smith succumbed to "[[Typhus|ship fever]]" contracted when administering last rites to Father Murphy of Staten Island, who had contracted the illness while tending recently arrived immigrants.&lt;ref name=Lafort/&gt;    

[[Alfred E. Smith]] served as an [[altar boy]] at this church&lt;ref name=fromatoz /&gt; when he was a student at its [[Catholic school|parochial school]], the former [[St. James Elementary School (New York)|St. James Elementary School]], located across the street.

The church was ordered to be closed by New York City officials in 1983, because of the danger of its roof collapsing.&lt;ref name=fromatoz /&gt; It was scheduled to be torn down in 1986, but was saved by the efforts of the community, especially the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]],&lt;ref name=aia /&gt; the first branch of which was organized in the church in 1836.&lt;ref name=fromatoz /&gt; The building suffered significant damage in a fire on January 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Jennifer H. and Paddock, Barry. "Firefighters Save Historic Manhattan Church," ''[[New York Daily News]]'' (January 11, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, St. James Parish merged with the nearby Parish of St. Joseph. The combined Parish of St. Joseph/St. James was merged again with the Church of the Transfiguration in 2015.

'''St. John's Cathedral''' is a [[cathedral]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], U.S. One of the oldest congregations in Jacksonville, it became the [[cathedra|seat]] of the Bishop of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Florida]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardcow.com/64985/st-johns-episcopal-cathedral-jacksonville-us-state-town-views-florida-jacksonville/#img Cardcow.com: postcard of St. John's Episcopal Cathedral with 1957 postmark]&lt;/ref&gt; The current building dates to 1906.

==History==
[[Image:StJohnsCathedralJaxLogo.PNG|left|100px|Cathedral Shield]]
The congregation was founded in 1834 as St. John's Parish. It is one of the seven original parishes dating to the reception of the Diocese of Florida into the Episcopal General Convention in 1838. According to the cornerstone for the present Cathedral, the first St. Johns Church was built in 1842 and burned in 1862 during the American Civil War. In the early 1870s, [[Edward Tuckerman Potter]] designed a new St. Johns and initial construction began in 1873. The church was completed and dedicated in 1877. This building burned in the [[Great Fire of 1901]], which destroyed most of [[Downtown Jacksonville]], and the next year a new church was designed by [[Howard Nott Potter]] of the firm Snelling and Potter. St. John's Cathedral was completed and consecrated in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Nemmers, John R.: [http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/manuscript/guides/potter.htm "A Guide to the Edward T. Potter Architectural Drawings"] University of Florida, Smathers Libraries&lt;/ref&gt;

St. John's is the only cathedral in Jacksonville.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, Joseph D., Jr., ''A Goodly Heritage: The Episcopal Church in Florida, 1821-1892'', Gainesville: University of Florida Press (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the building is cavernous; built in the [[Gothic Revival]] architectural style, stained-glass windows line the walls. In 1983, Advent Glass Works restored or repaired all stained glass in the Cathedral, the Cloister and the Cummings Chapel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventglassworks.com/customers.html Advent Glass Works: client project-St. John's Cathedral]&lt;/ref&gt;

==School==
The St. John's Cathedral School is sponsored by the Cathedral and Diocese and includes infants to Pre-K 4. It also receives funding from the [[Jessie Ball duPont Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stjohnscathedralschool.com/] St. John's Cathedral School website, About Us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Café==
''Clara's at the Cathedral Café'' is a cooperative project between the Cathedral and the School of Culinary Arts at the [[Clara White Mission]]. Every Friday since April 13, 2007, a luncheon has been prepared by the students and staff from the Mission's culinary school. The meal is very reasonably priced and attracts workers from downtown businesses and retirees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diocesefl.org/stjohnscathedral/topic-page.php?page=182 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725235436/http://diocesefl.org/stjohnscathedral/topic-page.php?page=182 |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }} St. Johns Cathedral webpage, Helping our Neighbors&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 5,700 companies, including 600 technology companies are headquartered in the area, including significant players such as [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]], [[Alcatel-Lucent]], [[Ericsson]], [[Verizon]], [[Samsung]], [[Texas Instruments]], and [[MetroPCS]]. Some of these companies also have offices in [[Telecom Valley]] located in California. Although the Telecom Corridor was a booming area of Dallas's economy during the late 1990s, the [[dot-com bubble|dot-com bust]] of 2001 hit the region hard. However, it began recovering in 2004, and that recovery has since picked up momentum, gaining both the operations of many non-technology-related companies and a large number of previously non-existent residential units designed in the [[New Urbanism|New Urbanist]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investors.com/editorial/IBDArticles.asp?artsec=17&amp;artnum=1&amp;issue=20070129 | title=Took Time, But Finally Tech Jobs Are Rising | accessdate=2007-01-31 | author=Reinhardt Krause | publisher=Investor's Business Daily |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070212084139/http://www.investors.com/editorial/IBDArticles.asp?artsec=17&amp;artnum=1&amp;issue=20070129 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Telecom Corridor" is a registered trademark and may technically only be used to describe the area mentioned in this article.

'''''The End of History and the Last Man''''' is a 1992 book by [[Francis Fukuyama]], expanding on his 1989 essay "The End of History?", published in the international affairs journal ''[[The National Interest]]''.&lt;ref name='endofhistory'&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0884-9382| issue = 16| pages = 3–18| last = Fukuyama| first = Francis| title = The End of History?| journal = The National Interest| date = 1989| jstor = 24027184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Fukuyama argues that the advent{{clarify|date=November 2018}} of [[Western world|Western]] [[liberal democracy]] may signal the endpoint of humanity's [[sociocultural evolution]] and the final form of human government.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the [[Cold War]], or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the [[end of history]] as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western [[liberal democracy]] as the final form of human government.&lt;ref name='endofhistory' /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fukuyama's position contradicts that of [[Karl Marx]], who predicted that [[communism]] would displace [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;"This social formation constitutes, therefore, the closing chapter of the prehistoric stage of human society." [[q:Karl Marx#preface|Preface to 'A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy']] (1859)&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama himself identifies on some level with Marx, but more strongly with the German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], by way of [[Alexandre Kojève]]. Kojève argued that the progress of history must lead toward the establishment of a "universal and homogenous" state,&lt;ref&gt;Strauss's term, from the Strauss-Kojève correspondence, published in [[Leo Strauss]], ''On Tyranny'' (University of Chicago Press, 1961)&lt;/ref&gt; most likely incorporating elements of liberal or social democracy; but Kojève's emphasis on the necessarily "post-political" character of such a state (and its citizens) makes such comparisons inadequate, and is irreducible to any mere "triumph" of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Kojève, ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the'' Phenomenology of Spirit, (Basic Books, 1969), "Note to the Second Edition," p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Highlights ==
*History should be viewed as an evolutionary process.
*Events still occur at the end of history.
*Pessimism about humanity's future is warranted because of humanity's inability to control technology.
*The end of history means liberal democracy is the final form of government for all nations. There can be no progression from liberal democracy to an alternative system.

===Misinterpretations===
According to Fukuyama, since the [[French Revolution]], democracy has repeatedly proven to be a fundamentally better system (ethically, politically, economically) than any of the alternatives.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The most basic (and prevalent) error in discussing Fukuyama's work is to confuse "history" with "events".{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Fukuyama claims not that events will stop occurring in the future, but rather that all that will happen in the future (even if [[totalitarianism]] returns) is that democracy will become more and more prevalent in the ''long'' term, although it may suffer "temporary" setbacks (which may, of course, last for centuries).

Some argue{{who|date=December 2010}} that Fukuyama presents "American-style" democracy as the only "correct" political system and argues that all countries must inevitably follow this particular system of government. However, many Fukuyama scholars claim this is a misreading of his work.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Fukuyama's argument is only that in the future there will be more and more governments that use the framework of [[parliamentary democracy]] and that contain markets of some sort. Indeed, Fukuyama has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The End of History'' was never linked to a specifically American model of social or political organization. Following [[Alexandre Kojève]], the Russian-French philosopher who inspired my original argument, I believe that the [[European Union]] more accurately reflects what the world will look like at the end of history than the contemporary United States.  The EU's attempt to transcend sovereignty and traditional power politics by establishing a transnational [[rule of law]] is much more in line with a "post-historical" world than the Americans' continuing belief in [[God]], [[national sovereignty]], and their military.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama. (2007-04-03).  [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/francis_fukuyama/2007/04/the_history_at_the_end_of_hist.html The history at the end of history.] [[The Guardian]]. Retrieved 2008-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Arguments in favour==
An argument in favour of Fukuyama's thesis is the [[democratic peace theory]], which argues that mature democracies rarely or never go to war with one another. This theory has faced [[democratic peace theory#Criticism|criticism]], with arguments largely resting on conflicting definitions of "war" and "mature democracy". Part of the difficulty in assessing the theory is that democracy as a widespread global phenomenon emerged only very recently in human history, which makes generalizing about it difficult. (See also [[list of wars between democracies]].)

Other major empirical evidence includes the elimination of interstate warfare in South America, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe among countries that moved from military dictatorships to liberal democracies.

According to several studies, the end of the Cold War and the subsequent increase in the number of [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total [[war]]fare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars, and the number of [[refugees]] and [[displaced person]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.systemicpeace.org/conflicttrends.html |title=Global Conflict Trends |website=Center for Systemic Peace |year=2017 |accessdate=2017-10-05}} &lt;!-- orig source link archived at web.archive.org/web/20080725183848/http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/conflict.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/2005/overview.aspx|title=Human Security Report 2005|website=[[Human Security Report Project]]|accessdate=2017-10-05}} &lt;!-- orig source link archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20070622155859/http://www.humansecurityreport.info --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Critics of liberal democracy===
Some have argued against the book due to an ideological disagreement with the concept of liberal democracy.

[[Jacques Derrida]] criticized Fukuyama in ''[[Specters of Marx]]'' (1993) as a "come-lately reader" of [[Alexandre Kojève]] "in the tradition of [[Leo Strauss]]", who already described US society in the 1950s as the "realization of communism". According to Derrida, Fukuyama—and the quick celebrity of his book—is but one symptom of the anxiety to ensure the "death of Marx". Fukuyama's celebration of [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[hegemony]] is criticized by Derrida:

{{quote|For it must be cried out, at a time when some have the audacity to neo-evangelize in the name of the ideal of a liberal democracy that has finally realized itself as the ideal of human history: never have violence, inequality, exclusion, [[famine]], and thus economic oppression affected as many human beings in the history of the earth and of humanity. Instead of singing the advent of the ideal of liberal democracy and of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] market in the euphoria of the end of history, instead of celebrating the ‘end of ideologies’ and the end of the great emancipatory discourses, let us never neglect this obvious macroscopic fact, made up of innumerable singular sites of suffering: no degree of progress allows one to ignore that never before, in absolute figures, have so many men, women and children been subjugated, starved or exterminated on the earth.&lt;ref name="Specters of Marx"&gt;Derrida, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Derrida goes on to analyze Fukuyama's book as taking part in the intellectual branch of current Western hegemony and the spreading of its "New Gospel": "This end of History is essentially a [[Christian eschatology]]. It is consonant with the current discourse of the Pope on the European community: destined to become a Christian State or Super-State, this community would still belong therefore to some Holy Alliance." He claims that the book uses a "sleight-of-hand trick" of making use of empirical data whenever it seems to suit its message, while appealing to an ideal whenever the empirical data contradicts it. Derrida points out that Fukuyama himself sees the real United States and European Union as imperfect compared to the "ideals" of liberal democracy and the free market. Even the author understands that such ideals are not demonstrated by empirical evidence or ever could be demonstrated empirically. They belong entirely to the realm of philosophy or religion, owing their birth to the Gospels of Philosophy of [[Hegel]]. And yet Fukuyama still uses a movement toward empirical observations, which he himself grants are imperfect and incomplete, to validate an idea that is purely idealistic and transcendent of any empirical reality or possibility.&lt;ref name="Specters of Marx"/&gt;

Certain versions of Marxism can be conceived as "end of history" philosophies. Therefore, Marxists like [[Perry Anderson]] have been among Fukuyama's fiercest critics. Apart from pointing out that capitalist democracies are still riven with poverty, racial tension, and the like, Marxists also reject Fukuyama's reliance on Hegel. According to them, Hegel's philosophy was fatally flawed until Marx "turned it on its head" to create [[historical materialism]]. Fukuyama argues that even though there is poverty, [[racism]], and [[sexism]] in present-day democracies, there is no sign of a major revolutionary movement developing that would actually overthrow capitalism. While Marxists disagree with Fukuyama's claim that ''capitalist'' democracy represents the end of history, they support the idea that the "end of history" will consist of the victory of democracy: [[communism]], in the Marxist view, must necessarily involve a form of [[direct democracy]].

Former [[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] argued against "the end of history": he argued his case in his September 2006 address to the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0920-22.htm|title=Text of Hugo Chávez's address to the United Nations General Assembly, September 2006|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005050541/http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0920-22.htm|archivedate=2006-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before that, in August 2006, Fukuyama wrote in response to Chávez's argument, his main point being that ''[[Chavismo]]'' was only possible due to the unique [[oil]] reserves of [[Venezuela]], and thus would not spread.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama. (2006-08-06). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/04/AR2006080401768.html History's Against Him]. [[The Washington Post]]. Retrieved 2008-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marxist interpretations aside, the economic and social philosophy of Fukuyama can be summarized as Free-Market Libertarian. Although this tends to be an ambiguous word, he uses it in the proper meaning for the time when the book was published. It has been argued that he might even be a Neoconservative on some points but this has been firmly shot down by him and his use of "ideal" systems which is firmly denounced by many Anarcho-Capitalists of the same rote who believe that no government can be good. His moral bent is strikingly similar but he does not identify with the founding fathers while espousing the same form of government to avoid petty debates.

===Radical Islam, tribalism, and the "Clash of Civilizations"===
Various Western commentators have described the thesis of ''The End of History'' as flawed because it does not sufficiently take into account the power of ethnic loyalties and religious fundamentalism as a counter-force to the spread of liberal democracy, with the specific example of [[Islamic fundamentalism]], or radical Islam, as the most powerful of these.

[[Benjamin Barber]] wrote a 1992 article and a 1995 book, ''[[Jihad vs. McWorld]]'', that addressed this theme. Barber described "[[McWorld]]" as a secular, liberal, corporate-friendly transformation of the world and used the word "[[jihad]]" to refer to the competing forces of tribalism and religious fundamentalism, with a special emphasis on Islamic fundamentalism.

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] wrote a 1993 essay, "[[Clash of Civilizations|The Clash of Civilizations]]", in direct response to ''The End of History''; he then expanded the essay into a 1996 book, ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''. In the essay and book, Huntington argued that the temporary conflict between ideologies is being replaced by the ancient conflict between civilizations. The dominant civilization decides the form of human government, and these will not be constant. He especially singled out Islam, which he described as having "bloody borders".

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], ''The End of History'' was cited by some commentators as a symbol of the supposed naiveté and undue optimism of the Western world during the 1990s, in thinking that the end of the [[Cold War]] also represented the end of major global conflict. In the weeks after the attacks, [[Fareed Zakaria]] called the events "the end of the end of history", while [[George Will]] wrote that history had "returned from vacation".&lt;ref name="history is still"&gt;[http://englishmatters.gmu.edu/issue6/911exhibit/emails/fukuyama_wsj.htm History Is Still Going Our Way], Francis Fukuyama, ''The Wall Street Journal'', October 5, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuyama did discuss radical Islam briefly in ''The End of History''. He argued that [[Islam]] is not an [[imperialist]] force like Stalinism and fascism; that is, it has little intellectual or emotional appeal outside the Islamic "heartlands". Fukuyama pointed to the economic and political difficulties that  [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] face and argued that such states are fundamentally unstable: either they will become democracies with a Muslim society (like  [[Turkey]]) or they will simply disintegrate. Moreover, when [[Islamic state]]s have actually been created, they were easily dominated by the powerful Western states.

In October 2001, Fukuyama, in a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' opinion piece, responded to the declarations that the September 11 attacks had disproved his views by stating that "time and resources are on the side of modernity, and I see no lack of a will to prevail in the United States today." He also noted that his original thesis "does not imply a world free from conflict, nor the disappearance of culture as a distinguishing characteristic of societies."&lt;ref name="history is still" /&gt;

In a 2008 ''[[Washington Post]]'' opinion piece, Fukuyama wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Democracy's only real competitor in the realm of ideas today is radical [[Islamism]]. Indeed, one of the world's most dangerous nation-states today is Iran, run by extremist Shiite mullahs. But as [[Peter Bergen]] pointed out in these pages last week, Sunni radicalism has been remarkably ineffective in actually taking control of a nation-state, due to its propensity to devour its own potential supporters. Some disenfranchised Muslims thrill to the rantings of Osama bin Laden or Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], but the appeal of this kind of medieval Islamism is strictly limited.&lt;ref name="they can only"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/22/AR2008082202395.html They Can Only Go So Far], Francis Fukuyama, ''The Washington Post'', August 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The resurgence of Russia and China===
Another challenge to the "end of history" thesis is the growth in the economic and political power of two countries, [[Russia]] and [[China]]; China has a [[one-party state]] government, while Russia, though formally a democracy, has been described by some as ''[[de facto]]'' authoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/7386448/Dmitry-Medvedevs-Russia-still-feels-the-cold-hand-of-Vladimir-Putin.html Dmitry Medvedev's Russia still feels the cold hand of Vladimir Putin], Andrew Osborn, ''The Daily Telegraph'', March 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Azar Gat]], Professor of National Security at [[Tel Aviv University]], argued this point in his 2007  ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article, "The Return of Authoritarian Great Powers", stating that the success of these two countries could "end the end of history".&lt;ref&gt;A. GAT, "The End of the End of History" in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', July/August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gat also discussed radical Islam, but stated that the movements associated with it "represent no viable alternative to modernity and pose no significant military threat to the developed world". He considered the challenge of China and Russia to be the  major threat, since they could pose a viable rival model which could inspire other states.

This view was echoed by [[Robert Kagan]] in his 2008 book, ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams'', whose title was a deliberate rejoinder to ''The End of History''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111002021637/https://literaryreview.co.uk/burleigh_05_08.html Return of the Dog Pack] (review of ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams''), [[Michael Burleigh]], ''Literary Review'', May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2008 ''Washington Post'' opinion piece, Fukuyama also addressed this point. He wrote, "Despite recent authoritarian advances, liberal democracy remains the strongest, most broadly appealing idea out there. Most autocrats, including [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] and [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]], still feel that they have to conform to the outward rituals of democracy even as they gut its substance. Even China's [[Hu Jintao]] felt compelled to talk about democracy in the run-up to [[2008 Summer Olympic|Beijing's Olympic Games]]."&lt;ref name="they can only" /&gt;

===Failure of civil society and political decay===
In 2014, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the publication of the original essay, "The End of History?", Fukuyama wrote a column in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' again updating his hypothesis. He wrote that, while liberal democracy still had no real competition from more authoritarian systems of government "in the realm of ideas", nevertheless he was less idealistic than he had been "during the heady days of 1989." Fukuyama noted the [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]] and the [[Arab Spring]], both of which seemed to have failed in their pro-democracy goals, as well as the [[democratic backsliding|"backsliding" of democracy]] in countries including [[Thailand]], [[Turkey]] and [[Nicaragua]]. He stated that the biggest problem for the democratically elected governments in some countries was not ideological but "their failure to provide the substance of what people want from government: personal security, shared economic growth and the basic public services... that are needed to achieve individual opportunity." Though he believed that economic growth, improved government and civic institutions all reinforced one another, he wrote that it was not inevitable that "all countries will... get on that escalator."&lt;ref name="25 years"&gt;{{cite web |title=At the 'End of History' Still Stands Democracy |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/at-the-end-of-history-still-stands-democracy-1402080661 |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Francis |last=Fukuyama |date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Twenty-five years later, the most serious threat to the end-of-history hypothesis isn't that there is a higher, better model out there that will someday supersede liberal democracy; neither Islamist theocracy nor Chinese capitalism cuts it. Once societies get on the up escalator of industrialization, their social structure begins to change in ways that increase demands for political participation. If political elites accommodate these demands, we arrive at some version of democracy.}}

Fukuyama also warned of "political decay," which he wrote could also affect established democracies like the United States, in which corruption and [[crony capitalism]] erode liberty and economic opportunity. Nevertheless, he expressed his continued belief that "the power of the democratic ideal remains immense."&lt;ref name="25 years" /&gt;

Following Britain's [[Brexit|decision to leave]] the [[European Union]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]] in 2016, Fukuyama feared for the future of liberal democracy in the face of resurgent populism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/09/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-fears-for-democracys-future/|title=The man who declared the ‘end of history’ fears for democracy’s future|author=Ishaan Tharoor|date=2017-02-09|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/world/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-now-fearful-of-the-very-fate-of-liberal-democracy|title=The man who declared the 'end of history' now fearful of the very fate of liberal democracy|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=2017-02-09|publisher=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prospect&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/america-the-failed-state-donald-trump|title=America: the failed state|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=Jan 2017|publisher=Prospect Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of a "post-fact world",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/the-emergence-of-a-post-fact-world-by-francis-fukuyama-2017-01?barrier=accessreg|title=The Emergence of a Post-Fact World|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=2017-01-12|publisher=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "twenty five years ago, I didn't have a sense or a theory about how democracies can go backward. And I think they clearly can." He also warned that America's political rot was infecting the world order to the point where it "could be as big as the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet collapse]]".&lt;ref name=prospect /&gt;

Fukuyama has also stated that his thesis was incomplete, but for a different reason: "there can be no end of history without an end of modern natural science and technology" (quoted from ''[[Our Posthuman Future]]''). Fukuyama predicts that humanity's control of its own [[evolution]] will have a great and possibly terrible effect on liberal democracy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15373">A '''union security agreement''' is a contractual agreement, usually part of a [[trade union|union]] [[collective bargaining]] agreement, in which an employer and a trade or labor union agree on the extent to which the union may compel employees to join the union, and/or whether the employer will collect dues, fees, and assessments on behalf of the union.&lt;ref name="Pynes"&gt;Pynes, Joan. ''Human Resources Management for Public and Nonprofit Organizations.'' 2d ed. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley and Sons, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7879-7078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The [[free rider problem]] is often cited as the rationale for union security agreements. A classic study of the free rider problem is presented in [[Mancur Olson]]'s 1965 work, ''[[The Logic of Collective Action]].''&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Mancur. ''The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups.'' 18th rev. ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-674-53751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In labor relations, the free rider problem exists because the costs of organizing a union and negotiating a contract with the employer can be very high, and because employers will find it too costly to adopt multiple wage and benefit scales, some or all non-union members may find that the contract benefits them as well.&lt;ref name="Cites"&gt;Towers, Brian. ''The Representation Gap: Change and Reform in the British and American Workplace.'' Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-829319-4}}; Holley, William H.; Jennings, Kenneth M.; and Wolters, Roger S. ''The Labor Relations Process.'' 9th ed. Florence, Ky.: Cengage Learning, 2008. {{ISBN|0-324-42144-3}}; Beatty, David M. ''Putting the Charter to Work: Designing a Constitutional Labour Code.'' Toronto: McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1987. {{ISBN|0-7735-0601-2}}; Bar-Niv, Zvi H. ''International Labour Law Reports, Volume 8.'' Leiden, The Netherlands: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1990. {{ISBN|0-7923-0429-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the incentive is for some individual workers to "ride for free" by not paying the costs, which can lead to the collapse of the union and no collective bargaining agreement.&lt;ref name="Cites" /&gt; If the union collapses, each worker may be worse off than if the union had negotiated the agreement.&lt;ref name="Cites" /&gt; Union security agreements are one way of ensuring that all (or nearly all) workers pay their fair share of the costs of collective bargaining (e.g., join the union and pay dues).&lt;ref name="Cites" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not all scholars agree that a free rider problem exists in labor relations. See: Baird, Charles W. ''Opportunity or Privilege: Labor Legislation in America.'' New York: Transaction Publishers, 1984. {{ISBN|0-912051-02-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are alternative solutions to the free rider problem in labor relations. One solution is for the state to provide rights (such as the right to administer welfare or pension funds, or to participate in a [[works council]]) or benefits (such as [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]]) only to unions or their members.&lt;ref name="Rothstein"&gt;Rothstein, Bo. "Labour-Market Institutions and Working-Class Strength." In ''Power Resources Theory and the Welfare State: A Critical Approach: Essays Collected in Honour of Walter Korpi.'' Julia Sila O'Connor and Gregg Matthew Olsen, eds. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8020-7171-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daubler"&gt;Daubler, Wolfgang. "The Individual and the Collective: No Problem for German Labor Law?" ''Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal.'' 10:505 (Summer 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Another solution is for unions to engage in members-only collective bargaining, which restricts the benefits of the contract to union members.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Morris (legal educator)|Morris, Charles]]. ''[[The Blue Eagle At Work|The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights In The American Workplace]].'' Ithaca, N.Y.: ILR Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8014-4317-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulman"&gt;Ulman, Lloyd; Eichengreen, Barry J.; and Dickens, William T. ''Labor and an Integrated Europe.'' Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8157-8681-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
The [[International Labour Organization]]'s [[Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention]] can "in no way be interpreted as authorising or prohibiting union security arrangements, such questions being matters for regulation in accordance with national practice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/pdconv.pl?host=status01&amp;textbase=iloeng&amp;document=1905&amp;chapter=3&amp;query=(Denmark)+%40ref&amp;highlight=&amp;querytype=bool&amp;context=0 "Case(s) No(s). 188, Report No. 34 (Denmark): Complaints against the Government of Denmark presented by Swiss Printing Workers' Union and the Swiss Federation of National Christian Trade Unions."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604190504/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/pdconv.pl?host=status01&amp;textbase=iloeng&amp;document=1905&amp;chapter=3&amp;query=(Denmark)+@ref&amp;highlight=&amp;querytype=bool&amp;context=0 |date=2011-06-04 }} Document No. 031960034188. Cases of the Committee on Freedom of Association. International Labor Organization. March 4, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Union security agreements are explicitly mentioned in the labor laws of many countries. They are highly regulated by law and court rulings in the [[United States]]&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Michael Evan. ''An Introduction to Labor Law.'' 2d rev. ed. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8014-8477-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser degree in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Ulman" /&gt; In [[Canada]], the legal status of the union security agreement varies from province to province and at the federal level, with a few provinces permitting but not requiring it but the majority of provinces (and the federal government) requiring it if the union requests it.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, James T. and Kaufman, Bruce E. ''The Future of Private Sector Unionism in the United States.'' Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7656-0852-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[Western European]] countries, the [[closed shop]] (one form of the union security agreement) is banned, while other forms go unregulated in labor law.&lt;ref name="Ulman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kassalow, Everett M. "The Closed and Union Shop in Western Europe: An American Perspective." ''Journal of Labor Research.'' 1:2 (June 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; But this is not a uniform conclusion, and law may vary widely. For example, in [[Germany]] both the right to join a union and the right ''not'' to join a union are equally protected by law and the courts, and all forms of union security agreements are banned.&lt;ref name="Daubler" /&gt; The law in [[Belgium]] has similar provisions.&lt;ref name="Ulman" /&gt; Still, since participation in the unemployment insurance system is compulsory and only unions have the right to administer this system, union membership in Belgium remains high.&lt;ref name="Rothstein" /&gt;

Outside [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]], the legal status of union security agreements varies even more widely. In [[New Zealand]], as of 1988, the closed shop was compulsory where a union organized the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Alexander. ''Two Models of Welfare: The Origins and Development of the Welfare State in Sweden and New Zealand, 1888-1988.'' Stockholm: Almqvist and Wiksell International, 1989. {{ISBN|91-554-2486-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Philippines]], various types of union security agreements are permitted under labor law.&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, Quintin C. ''The Philippine Labor Relations Law.'' Manila, Philippines: Rex Book Store, 2001. {{ISBN|971-23-0583-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mexico]], the closed shop was mandatory until the early 1990s, when a change in federal law permitted the [[union shop]], [[agency shop]], or no agreement at all.&lt;ref&gt;Befort, Stephen F. and Cornett, Virginia E. "Beyond the Rhetoric of the NAFTA Treaty Debate: A Comparative Analysis of Labor and Employment Law in Mexico and the United States." ''Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal.'' 17:269 (Winter 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaBotz"&gt;LaBotz, Dan. ''Mask of Democracy: Labor Suppression in Mexico Today.'' Boston: South End Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-89608-437-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; But because of the political ties between unions and the governing party in Mexico and other ways in which Mexican law favors established unions, the closed shop is essentially still the norm.&lt;ref name="LaBotz" /&gt;

Many countries, however, have not addressed the issue of union security agreements. Neither [[Indonesia]]n nor [[Thailand|Thai]] labor law addresses the issue, and in both countries collective bargaining, union administrative procedures, and dues collection are so weak that the union security issues rarely arise.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Marvin J. ''Worker Rights and Labor Standards in Asia's Four New Tigers: A Comparative Perspective.'' New York: Springer, 1997. {{ISBN|0-306-45477-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]], the legal status of union security agreements has varied widely across each state and the national government and over time. Australian labor law does not explicitly regulate union security agreements. However, various forms of the union security agreement have been favored at one time or another by each state, territory, or the national government, effectively regulating the favored type of union security agreement and disadvantaging its other forms.&lt;ref&gt;Weeks, Phillipa. ''Trade Union Security Law: A Study of Preference and Compulsory Unionism.'' Annandale, NSW, Australia: Federation Press, 1995. {{ISBN|1-86287-167-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Various types of union security agreements exist.  Among the more common are:
*'''[[Closed shop]]'''—The employer agrees to hire only union members. An employee who resigns from the union must be dismissed.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt;
*'''[[Union shop]]'''—The employer may hire anyone regardless of their union membership status, but the employee must join the union within a set time period (such as 30 days). An employee who resigns from the union must be dismissed.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt;
*'''[[Agency shop]]'''—The employer may hire anyone regardless of their union membership status, and the employee need not join the union. However, all non-union employees must pay a fee (known as the "agency fee") to the union to cover the costs of collective bargaining (and, in some countries, other fees as well). An employee who resigns from the union may not be dismissed but must pay the agency fee.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt;
*'''Fair share provision'''—The employer may hire anyone regardless of their union membership status, and the employee need not join the union. However, all non-union employees must pay a fee (known as the "fair share fee") to the union to cover the costs of collective bargaining. An employee who resigns from the union may not be dismissed but must pay the fair share fee.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt; In public sector collective bargaining, where the agency shop is often outlawed, the fair share provision (almost identical to the agency fee) may be negotiated instead.&lt;ref&gt;Marczely, Bernadette. ''Human Resource and Contract Management in the Public School: A Legal Perspective.'' New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2002. {{ISBN|0-8108-4379-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dues checkoff'''—A contract between the employer and union where the employer agrees to collect the dues, fees, assessments, and other monies from union members and/or non-members directly from each worker's paycheck and transmit those funds to the union on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="Pynes" /&gt;

== Janus v. AFSCME ==
''Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31'', _ US _ (2018) is a [[US labor law]] case, concerning whether governments violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] when they require their employees to pay fees to a union as a condition of employment.

In February 2015, [[Illinois]] Republican Governor [[Bruce Rauner]] filed suit, claiming that [[Fair-share agreement|fair-share agreements]] are unconstitutional and a violation of the [[First Amendment]] right to free speech.

In March 2015, three government workers from Illinois represented by attorneys from the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center and Virginia-based National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation took legal action to intervene in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.illinoispolicy.org/press-releases/state-workers-in-illinois-sue-to-end-mandatory-union-fees/|title=State workers in Illinois sue to end mandatory union fees|date=2015-03-23|work=Illinois Policy|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/06/union-stronghold-forced-dues.html|title=Unions battle for survival in key strongholds as court cases challenge forced dues|last=Ravve|first=Ruth|date=2015-04-06|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/3-state-employees-want-to-join-rauner-lawsuit-over-fair-share-union-fees/|title=3 state employees want to join Rauner lawsuit over ‘fair share’ union fees|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Rauner was dropped from the case, after a federal judge ruled that the governor did not have standing to bring such a suit, but the case proceeded under a new name, ''Janus v.

Janus claimed that he should not need to pay fees to the [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]] because doing so constitutes paying for political speech with which Janus disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;https://ljc-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/12/Rauner-v.-AFSCME-120-First-Amended-Complaint-2015.06.01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This became permissible after a 1977 decision by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Abood v. Detroit Board of Education]]''.

In June 2018, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of Janus, in a 5-4 decision, and stated that "States and public-sector unions may no longer extract agency fees from nonconsenting employees".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1466_2b3j.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
