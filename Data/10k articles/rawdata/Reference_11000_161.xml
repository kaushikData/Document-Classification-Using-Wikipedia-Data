'''Alma Stone Williams''' (1921 - November 5, 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Times and Democrat obituary (Nov. 10, 2013). http://thetandd.com/news/local/obituaries/alma-stone-williams----savannah-ga/article_0a1f626a-49bd-11e3-ae00-001a4bcf887a.html&lt;/ref&gt; was a musician, educator, music scholar, and pioneer in racial integration. Williams attended the 1944 Summer Music Institute. She was the first African-American student to be enrolled at Black Mountain College and the first black student to openly integrate a Southern white college.&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carolina |first1=State Archives of North |title=Finding Aid of the Black Mountain College Project CollectionPC.7008 |url=http://ead.archives.ncdcr.gov/PC_7008_Black_Mountain_College__.html |website=ead.archives.ncdcr.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Alma Stone Williams was highly educated. She attended [[Spelman College]] at the age of 15,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alma Stone Williams: ‘A Choice to Change the World’ |url=https://ebenezerray.com/2011/05/15/alma-stone-williams-a-choice-to-change-the-world/ |website=My Father's Posts |date=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; majoring in English and music, and graduating valedictorian. &lt;ref name=arc/&gt; Afterwards, she received her M.A. degree in English from Atlanta University. Williams began her teaching career at [[Penn School]] on [[Saint Helena Island (South Carolina)|St. Helena Island]] in South Carolina.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; After which, Educator [[Horace Mann Bond]] hired Williams to teach at [[Fort Valley State College]] and; furthermore, he nominated her to attend Black Mountain in the summer of 1944.

In 1944, Williams became the first black student&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, Micah (2014).

Board of Education of Topeka]]'' declaring state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. In a 2008 profile in the Ashville, North Carolina Urban News; Alma Williams commented on her pioneering desegregation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
“Pioneering did not frighten me. I was accustomed to studying and living with white teachers at Spelman and to reaching for high standards in all areas.”
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Afterwards, in 1945, she received a Julius [[Rosenwald Fellowship]] Fellowship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alma Stone Williams Archives - The Center for the Study of the American South |url=https://south.unc.edu/tag/alma-stone-williams/ |website=The Center for the Study of the American South}}&lt;/ref&gt; to attend the Juilliard School in New York City. Furthermore, she received a 2nd Masters degree, this time in musicology, from the [[University of Maryland]],&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; where she wrote her master’s thesis on [[Brahms]].&lt;ref name="obt"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alma Stone Williams -- Savannah, Ga. |url=https://thetandd.com/news/local/obituaries/alma-stone-williams----savannah-ga/article_0a1f626a-49bd-11e3-ae00-001a4bcf887a.html |website=The Times and Democrat |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career &amp; retirement==
At Fort Valley State College, where she returned to teach, Williams married a professor, Russell Williams, Sr. After his early death she taught at Savannah State University, South Carolina State University, and private music lessons to support their five children.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; Alma Stone Williams retired with two decades experience as a highly respected professor of English and Humanities at Savannah State.&lt;ref name=obt/&gt;

In retirement, Williams was co-founder of SONATA (Sponsors of New and Talented Artists), an organization that provides funds for children of Savannah to study music with former members of the Savannah Symphony Orchestra and other music professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SONATA Annual Scholarship Luncheon Held {{!}} The Savannah Tribune |url=http://www.savannahtribune.com/articles/sonata-annual-scholarship-luncheon-held/ |website=The Savannah Tribune |date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''apomorphism''' (from ''[[wikt:ἀπό|ἀπό]]'' — [[Greek (language)|Greek]] for "apart") is the [[categorical dual]] of a [[paramorphism]] and an extension of the concept of [[anamorphism]] ([[coinduction]]). Whereas a paramorphism models [[primitive recursion]] over an [[Recursive data type|inductive data type]], an apomorphism models primitive [[corecursion]] over a coinductive data type.

==Origins==
The term "apomorphism" was introduced in ''Functional Programming with Apomorphisms (Corecursion)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|

'''Aptery''' is the anatomical condition of an animal completely lacking any kind of [[wing]]s. An animal with this condition is said to be '''apterous'''.

Most animal species belong to and are [[phylogenetic]] descendants of apterous [[taxon|taxa]]. These groups are said to be '''primarily apterous'''.

Apterous animals which belong to or are phylogenetic descendants of winged taxa are said to be '''secondarily apterous'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10710">'''BogoMips''' (from "bogus" and [[million instructions per second|MIPS]]) is an unscientific measurement of [[CPU speed]] made by the [[Linux kernel]] when it boots to calibrate an internal [[busy-loop]].&lt;ref name='lj'&gt;{{cite journal | first = Wim | last = Van Dorst | journal = Linux Journal | title = The Quintessential Linux Benchmark |date=January 1996 | url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1120 | accessdate = 2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An often-quoted definition of the term is "the number of million times per second a processor can do absolutely nothing".&lt;ref name=quote&gt;[[Eric S Raymond]], and [[Geoff Mackenzie]], published on the [[Internet]] in the early 1990s, untraceable origin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=esr&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/BogoMIPS.html | first = Eric S. | last = Raymond | authorlink = Eric S Raymond | title = Hackers Jargon File}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BogoMips is a value that can be used to verify whether the processor in question is in the proper range of similar processors, i.e. BogoMips represents a processor's clock frequency as well as the potentially present [[CPU cache]]. It is not usable for performance comparisons among different CPUs.&lt;ref name=howto&gt;{{cite web | first = Wim | last = Van Dorst | url = http://www.clifton.nl/bogomips.html | title = BogoMips Mini-Howto | edition = V38 | date = 2 March 2006 | accessdate = 2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blidung|first=Thomas|title=Re: How many BogoMips should I expect from my 486DX2 running Linux?|url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.help/browse_thread/thread/5853976bc8851b04/7fbc3a800b981da0?hl=fr&amp;ie=UTF-8#7fbc3a800b981da0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1993, Lars Wirzenius posted an email message&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wirzenius|first=Lars|title=Re: printing &amp; BogoMips|url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux/browse_thread/thread/589fc4eaa432f8b6/ea0df3ceaa8f129a?hl=fr&amp;q=MIPS+is+short+for+Millions+of+Instructions#ea0df3ceaa8f129a}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining the reasons for its introduction in the Linux kernel on comp.os.linux:

: [...]

: MIPS is short for Millions of Instructions Per Second. It is a measure for the computation speed of a processor. Like most such measures, it is more often abused than used properly (it is very difficult to justly compare MIPS for different kinds of computers).

: BogoMips are [[Linus Torvalds|Linus]]'s own invention. The linux kernel version 0.99.11 (dated 11 July 1993) needed a timing loop (the time is too short and/or needs to be too exact for a non-busy-loop method of waiting), which must be calibrated to the processor speed of the machine. Hence, the kernel measures at boot time how fast a certain kind of busy loop runs on a computer. "Bogo" comes from "bogus", i.e, something which is a fake. Hence, the BogoMips value gives some indication of the processor speed, but it is way too unscientific to be called anything but BogoMips.

: The reasons (there are two) it is printed during boot-up is that a) it is slightly useful for debugging and for checking that the computer[’]s caches and turbo button work, and b) Linus loves to chuckle when he sees confused people on the news.

: [...]

== Proper BogoMips ratings ==
As a very approximate guide, the BogoMips can be pre-calculated by the following table. The given rating is typical for that [[Central processing unit|CPU]] with the then current and applicable [[Linux]] version. The index is the ratio of "BogoMips per clock speed" for any CPU to the same for an Intel 386DX CPU, for comparison purposes.

For a complete list, refer to the [http://tldp.org/HOWTO/BogoMips/bogo-list.html BogoMips mini-Howto].

With the 2.2.14 Linux kernel, a [[CPU cache|caching]] setting of the CPU state was moved from behind to before the BogoMips calculation. Although the BogoMips algorithm itself wasn't changed, from that kernel onward the BogoMips rating for then current Pentium CPUs was twice that of the rating before the change. The changed BogoMips outcome had no effect on real processor performance.

Linux command for visualization bogomips : &lt;span style="color:#0000FF"&gt;$ cat /proc/cpuinfo&lt;/span&gt;

== Computation of BogoMIPS ==
With kernel 2.6.x, BogoMIPS are implemented in the &lt;code&gt;/usr/src/linux/init/calibrate.c&lt;/code&gt; kernel source file. It computes the Linux kernel timing parameter &lt;code&gt;loops_per_jiffy&lt;/code&gt; (see [[jiffy (time)|jiffy]]) value. The explanation from source code:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 /*
   * A simple loop like
   *  while ( jiffies &lt; start_jiffies+1)
   *    start = read_current_timer();
   * will not do. As we don't really know whether jiffy switch
   * happened first or timer_value was read first. And some asynchronous
   * event can happen between these two events introducing errors in lpj.
   *
   * So, we do
   * 1. pre_start &lt;- When we are sure that jiffy switch hasn't happened
   * 2. check jiffy switch
   * 3. start &lt;- timer value before or after jiffy switch
   * 4. post_start &lt;- When we are sure that jiffy switch has happened
   *
   * Note, we don't know anything about order of 2 and 3.
   * Now, by looking at post_start and pre_start difference, we can
   * check whether any asynchronous event happened or not
   */
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;code&gt;loops_per_jiffy&lt;/code&gt; is used to implement &lt;code&gt;udelay&lt;/code&gt; (delay in microseconds) and &lt;code&gt;ndelay&lt;/code&gt; (delay in nanoseconds) functions. These functions are needed by some drivers to wait for hardware. Note that a [[busy waiting]] technique is used, so the kernel is effectively blocked when executing &lt;code&gt;ndelay&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;udelay&lt;/code&gt; functions. For i386 architecture &lt;code&gt;delay_loop&lt;/code&gt; is implemented in &lt;code&gt;/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/lib/delay.c&lt;/code&gt; as:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
/* simple loop based delay: */
static void delay_loop(unsigned long loops)
{
  int d0;

  __asm__ __volatile__(
    "\tjmp 1f\n"
    ".align 16\n"
    "1:\tjmp 2f\n"
    ".align 16\n"
    "2:\tdecl %0\n\tjns 2b"
    :"=&amp;a" (d0)
    :"0" (loops));
}
&lt;/source&gt;
equivalent to the following assembler code
&lt;source lang="asm"&gt;
;  input: eax = d0
; output: eax = 0
       jmp  start
.align 16
start: jmp  body
.align 16
body:  decl eax
       jns  body
&lt;/source&gt;
which can be rewritten to C-pseudocode
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
static void delay_loop(long loops)
{
  long d0 = loops;
  do {
    --d0;
  } while (d0 &gt;= 0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Full and complete information and details about BogoMips, and hundreds of reference entries can be found in the (outdated) BogoMips mini-Howto.&lt;ref name=howto/&gt;

== Timer-based delays ==

In 2012, [[ARM Holdings|ARM]] contributed a new &lt;code&gt;udelay&lt;/code&gt; implementation allowing the system timer built into many ARMv7 CPUs to be used instead of a busy-wait loop.  This implementation was released in Version 3.6 of the [[Linux kernel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARM: 7452/1: delay: allow timer-based delay implementation to be selected|last=Deacon|first=Will|url=https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d0a533b18235d36206b9b422efadb7cee444dfdb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timer-based delays are more robust on systems that use [[Dynamic frequency scaling|frequency scaling]] to dynamically adjust the processor's speed at runtime, as &lt;code&gt;loops_per_jiffies&lt;/code&gt; values may not necessarily scale linearly.  Also, since the timer frequency is known in advance, no calibration is needed at boot time.

One side effect of this change is that the BogoMIPS value will reflect the timer frequency, not the CPU's core frequency.  Typically the timer frequency is much lower than the processor's maximum frequency, and some users may be surprised to see an unusually low BogoMIPS value when comparing against systems that use traditional busy-wait loops.

The '''Cathedral of the Nativity of the Theotokos''' in [[Suzdal]], Russia, is a [[World Heritage Site]]. It is one of the eight [[White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal]]., and one of the most complex monuments of Russian medieval architecture. It was originally constructed during the reign of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] during the late 11th century.

The Cathedral of the Nativity is surrounded by a ring of earthen walls in an oxbow of Kamenka River.  It is notable for being the first city cathedral not built for the exclusive use of the [[knyaz]] or his relatives. The cathedral contains the remains of a son of [[Yuri Dolgoruki]], knyazes of the [[Shuisky]] family and others.

==History==
The cathedral was originally built during the reign of Vladimir II Monomakh in 1102.&lt;ref name=Brumfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Brumfield|first=William Craft|title=Landmarks of Russian Architect: A Photographic Survey|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9056995367|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXex6iIh2y4C&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Church+of+the+Nativity+of+the+Theotokos+1222&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xcpRUZabCcm20QGSpIDYCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Church%20of%20the%20Nativity%20of%20the%20Theotokos%201222&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1222, on the orders of [[Yuri II of Vladimir]] the dilapidated building was taken down and replaced by a new one built of white stone. Thus it remained until 1528, when the white stone walls above the arcade are replaced by brick. In the 17th century, the previously three-domed cathedral was given five domes and the interior was partially repainted. Thus the cathedral survives to this day with numerous changes throughout its history, both in the exterior, and the interior, where the wall frescoes are of 13th-, 15th- and 17th-century origin. The cathedral has also endured fire several times.

'''''Christie’s World Encyclopedia of Champagne &amp; Sparkling Wine''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] written by [[Tom Stevenson]], published by Absolute Press, which is devoted to subjects relating to [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] and [[sparkling wine]]. The foreword is written by [[Michael Broadbent]]. A smaller reduced version, ''Champagne &amp; Sparkling Wine Guide'', is published in the [[soft cover]] format.

When first published in 1998, the book became the only wine book to warrant a leader in a UK national newspaper (''[[The Guardian]]'', October 14, 1998), for the first time revealing a 17th-century document proving that the English used a [[Sparkling wine production#Second fermentation|second fermentation]] to convert still [[wine]]s into sparkling at least six years before [[Dom Pérignon (person)|Dom Pérignon]] arrived at the Abbey of Hautvillers, and nearly 40 years before the French claim that sparkling Champagne was invented.&lt;ref name=decajudg&gt;{{cite web| last = ''Decanter.com''| title = ''Decanter'' World Wine Awards: Judges | url = http://www.decanter.com/worldwineawards/judges1.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''[[Le Figaro]]'' accused Stevenson of “trying to burn Dom Pérignon”, the French were prompt to award it The Best Wine Book of 1998 at the Salon International du Livre Gourmand in Périgueux.&lt;ref name=wak-ts&gt;{{cite web|last= Goode |first= Jamie, wineanorak.com |title= Tom Stevenson |url= http://www.wineanorak.com/bookshop/astevenson.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranked among its "Top Ten Best Wine Books" by ''[[The Independent]]'' it has been characterised as "still the best guide to fizz”,&lt;ref name=ind10&gt;{{cite web|last= Willamson |first= Moore, ''The Independent'' |title= The Ten Best Wine Books |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-ten-best-wine-books-443167.html |date= April 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "authoritative, opinionated and comprehensive", and a vital purchase for any Champagne lover.&lt;ref name=wd-tsb&gt;{{Cite web|last= Kissack |first= Chris, thewinedoctor.com|title= Wine Books: Tom Stevenson |url= http://www.thewinedoctor.com/otherresources/stevenson.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
{{Essay-like|date=July 2008}}
The book opens with "A Little History", accounting numerous occurrences throughout time of accidental sparkling wine, and the first documented evidence of a deliberately produced sparkling wine, as recorded by [[Christopher Merret]]. In Merret’s eight-page paper "Some observations concerning the ordering of wines", which he presented to the newly formed [[Royal Society]] on December 17, 1662, he states “our wine-coopers of recent times use vast quantities of sugar and molasses to all sorts of wines to make them drink brisk and sparkling”. Stevenson explains why the French did not have the technology to produce any sparkling wine in 1662, and how it was almost inevitable that the English did. He explains the paradox of "sparkling champaign", which is mentioned by George Etheredge in The Man of Mode in 1676, yet did not exist in France until the late 1690s. The documentary evidence presented is a significant aspect of ''Christie’s World Encyclopedia of Champagne &amp; Sparkling Wine'', though only a part of it.

An overview of the six different methods of sparkling wine production is provided in "How Sparkling Wines Are Made", exploring the most important of these in the sections "A Step-by-Step Guide to ''[[Sparkling wine production#Traditional method|Méthode Champenoise]]'' and "The Elusive Quality Factor". Argumenting that intrinsic quality exists beyond the personal preference of taste, Stevenson analyses what precisely contributes to the intrinsic quality of a sparkling wine, starting with establishing the [[vineyard]], from site selection to the varieties of grape, and how they should be grown, harvested, and [[pressed (wine)|pressed]], looking at [[ripeness levels (wine)|ripeness levels]] and [[acidity (wine)|acidity]], through every aspect of the production process.

Stevenson offers an argument why [[chaptalisation]] might actually contribute to Champagne’s perceived "lean" structure. He discusses ideal fermentation temperatures to give a "fast and furious first fermentation" and a long "low-temperature second fermentation", the pros and cons of [[malolactic fermentation]], what the ''[[Sparkling wine production#Traditional method|assemblage]]'' is, how to obtain good mousse retention, the importance of small bubbles, what affects their size, the effects of autolysis, [[Sparkling wine production#Aging on lees|ageing on lees]], adding a ''[[Dose (biochemistry)|dosage]]'' and post-disgorgement ageing. Stevenson also tests out nine [[Riedel]] glasses on 100 different Champagnes and sparkling wines, offering his conclusions alongside Riedel’s official design purpose.

The main section of this book consists of a country-by-country, region-by-region assessment of sparkling wines, with every producer rated on a 100-point scale, and all their wines given a star [[wine rating]] (three star maximum). Champagne receives the largest coverage, occupying 98 pages, but 10 other French regions (Alsace, Loire, Burgundy, Bordeaux, Limoux, others) receive 45 pages, while 141 pages covers the rest of the world (Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Austria, Southeast Europe, other European, South Africa, The United States, California, Others USA, Canada, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia). These pages hold technical data and the historical development of sparkling wines locally, as well as Stevenson’s own critiques of the producers, the lowest rating of which is 35, demonstrating his policy to utilise all 100 points of the scale.

This software is commonly used for desktop recording, gameplay recording and video editing. Screencasting software is typically limited to streaming and recording desktop activity alone, in contrast with a [[software vision mixer]], which has the capacity to mix and switch the output between various input streams.

The '''''Cyclopædia of Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical Literature''''' is a reference work of ten volumes and two supplements published in the 19th century, co-authored by [[John McClintock (theologian)|John McClintock]], academic and minister, and Dr. [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]], professor of [[exegetical theology]]. The works were published by [[Harper and Brothers]].

As an [[encyclopædia]], the authors set out to create a scholarly work, but accessible to the non-expert, designed to be{{cquote|a Manual of Sacred Literature for the use of Ministers, Students, General Readers, and Sunday School Libraries, so complete in itself that no other work will be necessary for ordinary purposes of reference in these branches of knowledge.&lt;ref name=volume1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ahRWAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cyclop%C3%A6dia+of+Biblical,+theological,+and+ecclesiastical+literature&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fRj5TbDhOuH00gHQv9SMCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Cyclopaedia of Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical literature''], Vol. I: A-B, James Strong, John McClintock, [[Google Books]] scan&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The {{nihongo|'''''Dai Kan-Wa Jiten'''''|大漢和辞典||"The Great Chinese–Japanese Dictionary"}} is a [[Japanese dictionary]] of ''[[kanji]]'' ([[Chinese characters]]) compiled by [[Tetsuji Morohashi]]. Remarkable for its comprehensiveness and size, Morohashi's dictionary contains over 50,000 character entries and 530,000 [[compound word]]s. [[Haruo Shirane]] (2003:15) says: "This is the definitive [[dictionary]] of the Chinese characters and one of the great dictionaries of the world."

==History==
Tetsuji Morohashi was originally motivated to create a dictionary in 1917 when he went to China to study Chinese. Trying to look up words in the largest available [[Chinese dictionaries]] was frustrating; the ''[[Kangxi Zidian]]'' defines characters but not phrases, the ''[[Peiwen Yunfu]]'' lists phrases without definitions, and the ''[[Zhonghua Da Zidian]]'' had just been published. Morohashi's autobiography explains (Wilkinson 2000:74) that "he had to spend between a quarter and a third of his study time trying to find the meanings of words and phrases. This tedium he felt could be avoided if there were a dictionary that provided both citations and definitions." When Morohashi returned to Japan in 1919, he had 20 notebooks filled with Chinese vocabulary. 

In 1925, {{Nihongo|Ippei Suzuki|鈴木 一平}}, president of the Taishukan publishing house, requested Morohashi to edit a comprehensive kanji dictionary of an unprecedented scale. In order to print this giant [[reference work]], fonts for many rare characters had to be created, since none existed. The first volume was published in 1943, but the [[fire-bombing of Tokyo]] destroyed the printing plates and special fonts in 1945. After the war, Morohashi and his fellow editors reconstructed the dictionary from proofs. Due to a shortage of skilled craftsmen, Suzuki persuaded {{Nihongo|Mokichi Ishii|石井 茂吉}}, inventor of [[phototypesetting]], to recreate the necessary fonts. The first volume was published in 1955 and the final index volume in 1960. Morohashi was awarded the [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]] in 1957 and the [[Order of Culture]] in 1967 for his contributions to [[sinology]] and [[lexicography]]. Taishukan published a vocabulary index in 1990 and a supplemental volume in 2000.

==First edition==
The original (1955–1960) ''Dai Kan-Wa Jiten'' has 13 volumes totaling 13,757 pages, and includes 49,964 head entries for characters, with over 370,000 words and phrases. This unabridged dictionary, often called the ''Morohashi'' in English, focuses upon [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Classical Chinese|Literary Chinese]] vocabulary. It provides encyclopedic information about poetry, book titles, historical figures, place names, Buddhist terms, and even modern expressions. The ''Dai Kan-Wa Jiten'' is intended for reading Chinese and does not cover Japanese words created since the [[Meiji period|Meiji era]].

This is the format for main character entries:
*Pronunciations, in [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese borrowings]], [[Middle Chinese]] with every [[fanqie]] spelling and [[rime dictionary]] category listed in the ''[[Jiyun]]'', and [[Modern Standard Chinese]] in the ''[[Zhuyin]]'' (or ''Bopomofo'') system and in [[Wade-Giles]] romanization. Volume 1 contains {{nihongo|''Hanrei''|凡例||"Introductory Remarks"}} and a comprehensive chart comparing the Zhuyin, Wade-Giles, and [[Pinyin]] systems for every phoneme used in modern Chinese.
*10,000 [[Seal script]] characters, plus other variant written forms.
*Meanings, diachronically arranged by earliest citations. Usage examples are given from numerous classical texts and Chinese dictionaries.
*Character etymologies are occasionally included. These are not instances of word [[etymology]] as the term is understood in [[comparative linguistics]], but character analysis, as originated by the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''.
*2,300 Illustrations are included where useful, often copied from sources like the 1609 [[Sancai Tuhui]].

One archaism of the first edition is giving Japanese pronunciations of characters in [[historical kana usage]] rather than modern, retaining for instance now-obsolete {{lang|ja|ゐ}} ''wi'' and {{lang|ja|ゑ}} ''we''.

Each individual volume has a [[radical-and-stroke sorting]] index arranged by [[Chinese radical]] or signific (following the 214 [[Kangxi radicals]]), and subdivided by the total number of remaining [[stroke order|strokes]] in the character. For ''Dai Kan-Wa Jiten'' users unfamiliar with this traditional system of dictionary [[collation]], the final index volume is an essential tool.

Volume 13 contains four indices to the dictionary, which cite volume and page numbers for each character.
*The {{nihongo|''Sōkaku sakuin''|総画索引||"Total Stroke Count Index"}} divides characters by overall stroke count (1-64), subdivided by radicals.
*The {{nihongo|''Jion sakuin''|字音索引||"Sino-Japanese Reading Index"}} arranges characters by their borrowed Chinese pronunciations (''[[on'yomi]]''), then by stroke count.
*The {{nihongo|''Jikun sakuin''|字訓索引||"Japanese Reading Index"}} arranges characters by their native Japanese pronunciations (''[[kun'yomi]]''), and further by stroke count.
*The {{nihongo|''Shikaku gōma sakuin''|四角號碼索引||"[[Four corner method]] Index"}} organizes characters using a complex Chinese system of four-digit numbers (0000-9999), plus an optional extra number, then subdivided by the number of strokes.

Volume 13 also contains a {{nihongo|''Hoi''|補遺||"Appendix"}} listing 1,062 Chinese characters that the dictionary uses in definitions but does not include as main entries, plus the official 1,850 Japanese [[tōyō kanji]] for general use, and 517 [[simplified Chinese character]]s.

==Supplemental volumes==
Since the death of Tetsuji Morohashi in 1982 at the age of 99, Taishukan has published two ''Dai Kan-Wa Jiten'' augmentations that amount to Volumes 14 and 15.

The handy 1990 {{nihongo|''Goi sakuin''|語彙索引||"Vocabulary Index"}} allows searching for words in Morohashi by their pronunciation in modern kana spelling, instead of the historical system used in Volumes 1-13. This index comprehensively lists every compound word listed in the main dictionary, including terms, phrases, [[four-character idioms]], etc. Vocabulary is arranged in the standard {{nihongo|''[[gojūon]]''|五十音||"fifty sound"}} ordering of ''[[kana]]'', and is cited by volume and page numbers.

The 2000 {{nihongo|''Hokan''|補巻||"Supplemental Volume"}} adds some 800 main character entries, approximately 33,000 new vocabulary terms, novel readings of characters, variant characters, etc. This last volume includes four types of character indexes.  Like the "Vocabulary Index", this supplement uses standard modern ''kana'' but also provides the historical equivalents.

==Other editions==
Despite the competition from the CD-ROM version of the [[Hanyu Da Cidian]], Taishukan has not released an electronic ''Dai Kan-Wa Jiten'' edition. This owes not only to the dictionary's huge scale but also to the fact many of its 50,000 characters could not be [[Character encoding|encoded]] until recently.

The (1962–1968) ''[[Zhongwen Da Cidian]]'', sometimes called the ''Chinese Morohashi'', is very similar in structure to ''Dai Kan-Wa Jiten'' and was one of the most comprehensive Chinese dictionaries available until 1993.

In 1982, Taishukan published an abridged "family edition" of the ''Dai Kan-Wa Jiten''. Their four-volume {{nihongo|''Kō Kan-Wa Jiten''|広漢和辞典||"Extensive Chinese–Japanese Dictionary"}} enters 20,769 characters and some 120,000 words. It adds early [[oracle bone script]] and [[bronzeware script]] examples, and proposes hypothetical [[Old Chinese]] etymologies and word families.

Kida Jun'ichirō wrote a Japanese book (1986) about the ''Dai Kan-Wa Jiten'', and edited another (1994) about lexicographers that discusses Morohashi's contributions (chap. 4) and Ishii's creation of characters (chap. 11).

'''Earl Gray McCready''' (June 5, 1905 &amp;ndash; December 9, 1983) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] amateur wrestler. McCready competed in the U.S. for Oklahoma State University in folkstyle, and  as a [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] [[Amateur wrestling|sport wrestler]] who competed for Canada in the [[1928 Summer Olympics]]. Later in life he became a pro wrestler.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Leeds and the Thousand Islands, Ontario|Lansdowne, Ontario]], and died in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States.

==Amateur wrestling==
In 1928 he finished sixth in the Olympic Freestyle Heavyweight Tournament.

At the 1930 Empire Games he won the gold medal in the heavyweight class.

McCready attracted the attention of Oklahoma State wrestling coaches when he defeated their heavyweight at a 1926 tournament in Canada. McCready came to the Stillwater, Oklahoma college, where he played football and wrestled. In three years of wrestling varsity, the 5'11", 238-pound McCready was 25-0, with all but three of his victories by pin.

As an Oklahoma State Cowboy, McCready won three NCAA heavyweight titles (1928-1930), becoming the first three-time NCAA champion at any weight. He was also the first foreign-born NCAA wrestling champ. He is one of only two collegiate wrestlers with three NCAA titles to win all three of his finals matches by pin (the other being Dan Hodge of the University of Oklahoma, 177-pound champ, 1955-1957). McCready still owns the record fastest fall in an NCAA final, pinning Ralph Freese of the University of Kansas in just nineteen seconds at the very first NCAA wrestling championship in 1928.

==Professional wrestling career==
McCready worked for [[Stu Hart]]'s [[Stampede Wrestling]] during the 50s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver, Greg|url= http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosM/mccready.html|title=SLAM!

In [[Philippine mythology]], '''Ekek''' (or '''Ek Ek''') are bird-like human creatures. They are winged-humans who search for victims at night. They hunger for flesh and blood. They are usually described as flying creatures that look like the ''[[Manananggal]]'', but are unable to divide or split their body in the way that the Manananggal does. The Ekek is also associated with the ''[[Wak Wak]]'' because of some similar characteristics. The only difference between a ''Wak Wak'' and ''Ekek'' is that ''Ekek'' has a bird-like [[Beak|bill]] whereas  the ''Wak Wak'' has none.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= mella, aLfie vera|coauthors= |title=Mga Engkanto: A Bestiary of Filipino Fairies|year=2003 |publisher= eLf ideas Publication|location=Philippines |isbn= |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Ekek'' can transform into a huge bird or bat at night to prowl in the form of. Similar to the Manananggal, the ''Ekek'' looks for sleeping pregnant women. Then it extends a very long proboscis into the womb and kills the fetus by draining its blood. It is said that while this is taking place, a "ek-ek-ek" sound is often heard.  The ''Ekek'' fools people into thinking it is far off in the distance by producing a faint sound when it is actually near.

The '''electronic receipt''' or '''e-receipt''' is an electronic [[Receipt]] of any product or service that was purchased.

== Implementation ==
Digital receipts are normally sent via e-mail or via an app. Unlike paper receipts, e-receipts are used to reduce paper usage. These e-receipts are used to inform the customer of rebates and discounts. Another important purpose is to use the digital receipts as marketing instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perring |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/639219/Ereceipts-British-shops-shopping-electronic-Internet |title=Retailers are now monitoring YOUR shopping habits and transactions with the eReceipt... |work=[[Daily Express#Sunday Express]] |date=2016-01-29 |accessdate=2016-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the use of e-receipts is [[Business Intelligence]]. Through the usage of these e-receipts, companies can track their customers easier in terms of purchases, which supports the Business intelligence. Through this companies can adapt their marketing campaign towards the customers. The e-receipt helps to connect customers to their in-store purchases. Merchants can issue E-receipts using own mechanisms or use external services specialized on electronic payments. One of such providers is Square Inc. Ecoslips.com provides an integrated solution to retailers, payment providers and EFTPOS platforms to send digital receipts to consumer cell phones. They've come up with a unique architecture to automate electronic receipts receipts without the need to share any personal information or credit card tokens. Other companies are specialized in E-receipt aggregation allowing a consumer to see all E-receipts, in one place, for example WalletWizz Inc.

Possible ways of distributing the email receipts may be to send an [[e-mail]], an [[Mobile app|app]] or a [[website]]/[[Web application|web app]]. The general idea of the e-receipt remains the same, there are only different ways of distribution. There are many different companies that already offer their customers e-receipts. In the following part these different companies and technologies are compared and their pros and cons are discussed.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''pediaphobia'''.&lt;ref&gt;Kring, A., Davison, G., et al. (2006) ''Abnormal Psychology'' Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djordjevic, S. (2004) ''Dictionary of Medicine: French-English with English-French Glossary.'' Schreiber Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Other age-focused fears are [[ephebiphobia]] and [[gerontophobia]]. Recognised outcomes of pedophobia include [[paternalism]], [[adultism]], and by extension, [[ageism]].

==Etymology==

The word ''pedophobia'' comes from the Greek roots παιδ- ''paid-'' "child" and φόβος ''-phóbos'' "fear."

==Scientific analysis==
The fear of children has been diagnosed and treated by psychiatrists, with studies examining the effects of multiple forms of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, C., Houlihan, D., Krueger, K. F., Simon, D. A. (1997) "The Behavioral Treatment of a Young Adult with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and a Fear of Children," ''Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy, 19''1, p37-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists have situated "contemporary fears about children and childhood", e.g. paedophobia, as "contributing to the ongoing social construction of childhood", suggesting that "generational power relations, in which children's lives are bounded by adult surveillance" affect many aspects of society.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, S., Jackson, S., &amp; Backett-milburnswings, K. (1998) "Swings and roundabouts: Risk anxiety and the everyday worlds of children," ''Sociology, 32'' p. 689-705. [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; More than one study has identified the fear of children as a factor affecting biological conception in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Kemeter, P. &amp; Fiegl, J. (1998) "Adjusting to life when assisted conception fails," ''Human Reproduction. 13''4 p. 1099–1105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, R. (1968) "The Role of Emotional Factors in Obstetric Complications: A Review," ''Psychosomatic Medicine 30'' p. 222-237. American Psychosomatic Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular perception==
Paedophobia is the ''raison d'etre'' for several international [[social justice]] movements addressing young people, including [[children's rights]] and [[youth participation]]. Major international organisations addressing paedophobia, either outright or by implication, include [[Save the Children]] and [[Children's Defense Fund]]. However, some organisations, particularly those associated with the [[youth rights]] movement, claim that these movements perpetuate paedophobia.&lt;ref&gt;Axon, K. (n.d.) [http://www.asfar.org/zine/1st/Paedophobia.html ''The Anti-Child Bias of Children's Advocacy Groups''] Chicago, IL: Americans for a Society Free of Age Restrictions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity of this notion is exacerbated by observations by experts such as [[Letty Cottin Pogrebin]], a founding editor of ''[[Ms. magazine]]'', who is said to have diagnosed America as having an "epidemic of paedophobia", saying that, "though most of us make exceptions for our own offspring, we do not seem particularly warm-hearted towards other peoples' children."&lt;ref&gt;L. Pogrebin, as cited in Zelizer, V. (1994) ''Pricing the Priceless Child: The Changing Social Value of Children'' [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
One author suggests that the cause of the fear of children in [[academia]] specifically extends from [[adult|adults']] distinct awareness of the capacity of children as she wrote, "Children embarrass us because they point ever too cleverly and clearly to our denial of personal, material, and maternal history."&lt;ref&gt;Coiner, C. &amp; George, D.H. (1998) ''The Family Track: Keeping Your Faculties while You Mentor, Nurture, Teach, and Serve'' [[University of Illinois Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; A separate report suggests that the source of current trends in the fear of children have a specific source, namely,

:[[James Q. Wilson]], a professor at [[UCLA]]'s School of Management... back in 1975... helped inaugurate the current climate of paedophobia [when he said] "a [[Critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]] of younger persons... creates an explosive increase in the amount of crime."&lt;ref&gt;Murashige, M. (2001). ''The Future of Change: Youth Perspectives on Social Justice and Cross-Cultural Collaborative Action in Los Angeles.'' Los Angeles: [http://mcc-la.org MultiCultural Collaborative].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addressing the issue==
As mentioned above, [[social service]], [[human rights]], and [[social justice]] organizations have been tackling the fear of children for dozens of years. The United Nations has created the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], which is implicitly designed to address pedophobia by fostering [[intergenerational equity]] between children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Penn, J. (1999) &lt;!-- [http://www.childcarecanada.org/pubs/fs/fs5.pdf ''The Rights Of Young Children.''] ???--&gt; London University Institute of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

As evidenced above, paedophobia is distinctly addressed by academic, especially evidenced since the creation of the field of [[Youth studies]]. The influence of the fear of children in [[American popular culture]] is examined by critical media analysts who have identified the effects of paedophobia in both [[List of notable Disney feature films|Disney]]&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, H. (1999) ''The Mouse that Roared: Disney and the End of Innocence.'' [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[horror movies|horror]] films.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, K. (2005) ''Projected Fears: Horror Films and American Culture.'' [[Praeger Publishers]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide range of other authors and scholars, including [[Henry Giroux]],&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://www.freechild.org/ReadingList/henry_giroux.htm Reading List on Henry Giroux]. [[The Freechild Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Males]] and [[Barbara Kingsolver]],&lt;ref&gt;Dudley-Marling, C., Jackson, J., &amp; Patel, L. (2006) "Disrespecting Childhood, ''[[Phi Delta Kappan]] 87''10 (June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the popular modern fear of children stems from [[corporatisation]] of [[mass media]] and its complicity with a range of [[political]] and [[economic]] interests. Males perhaps goes the furthest, and wrote an entire book exploring the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Males, M. (2001) ''Kids and Guns: How Politicians, Experts, and the Media Fabricate Fear of Youth.'' Common Courage Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voluntary Childless Parents or Childfree Individuals ===
{{Original research section|date=May 2018}}

While there are many families in the world, not all couples or even humans desire to have families or children. The United States Bureau of the Census conducted a study in 1971, which they say the data still seems to be the same today concerning birth rates and parent-to-child ratios.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} They believe it is too early to say that (increased rates of childless families) foretell a future increase of childless homes in general or just later birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bram|first=Susan|date=1985-09-01|title=Childlessness revisited: A longitudinal study of voluntarily childless couples, delayed parents, and parents|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01435914|journal=Lifestyles|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=46–66|doi=10.1007/BF01435914|issn=0161-570X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of married couples voluntarily choosing to be childless are only increasing.  As social trends are hard to predict and therefore fertility expectations, attitudes, behaviors and such are uneasy to consistently gather data for, leaving voluntarily childlessness hard to track.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} There is a forum on the popular website, Reddit, where self-described childfree individuals from around the world discuss the childfree lifestyle. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Agnieszka Bień et al.,the amount of women choosing to remain childless is increasing for many reasons. This choice to remain childless is due to different and emerging socio-cultural factors including: a different outlook on a professional career and life, shifting focus to self-fulfillment and individualism, and changing patterns of norms of family types. In more recent years, society has become more open-minded and accepting to the choosing to not have children. Overpopulation and climate change are some other factors that influence a woman's decision to remain voluntarily childless. Not only is society accepting this idea and choice more, the choice of being childless to some degree is even becoming desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bień|first=Agnieszka|last2=Rzońca|first2=Ewa|last3=IWANOWICZ-PALUS|first3=GRAŻYNA|last4=Lecyk|first4=Urszula|last5=Bojar|first5=Iwona|date=2017-05-11|title=The quality of life and satisfaction with life of women who are childless by choice|url=http://aaem.pl/abstracted.php?level=5&amp;ICID=1235181|journal=Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine|language=english|volume=24|issue=2|doi=10.5604/12321966.1235181|issn=1232-1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Childhood friends Dustin Coupal (an eye doctor) and Jason Toews (a computer programmer from Saskatchewan) founded GasBuddy in April 2000 in [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/webs-eye-view-of-gas-prices/|title=Web's-Eye View Of Gas Prices|last=Vries|first=Lloyd|date=August 24, 2004|work=[[CBS News]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="INC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/articles/201105/small-business-success-stories-gasbuddy.html|title=Creating Apps to Fuel Growth|last=Hofman|first=Mike|date=May 16, 2011|website=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2000, Toews and Coupal launched the collection of GasBuddy websites as a way for consumers to share gas-pricing information. They filed as a Minnesota for-profit corporation in April 2004 as GasBuddy Organization Inc.&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mblsportal.sos.state.mn.us/Business/SearchDetails?filingGuid=e2dee121-88d4-e011-a886-001ec94ffe7f|title=GasBuddy Organization Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=Oct 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, GasBuddy launched OpenStore with its first convenience store partner, [[Rutter's]], by building the Rutter's app and supporting digital marketing efforts through its custom platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csnews.com/industry-news-and-trends/technology/year-app-part-1|title=The Year of the App, Part 1|last=Negraval|first=Samantha|date=October 30, 2013|website=Convenience Store News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of 2010, GasBuddy launched its own set of apps that allowed users to input prices via their smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.gasbuddy.com/posts/GasBuddy-Turns-15/1715-614514-3093.aspx|title=GasBuddy Turns 15!|last=|first=|date=|website=GasBuddy Blog|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, UCG, a [[Private company|privately held]], [[business-to-business]] company headquartered in [[Rockville, Maryland]], announced that [[Oil Price Information Service (OPIS)]] had acquired GasBuddy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ucg.com/GreatPlace/UCGInTheNews.aspx?nid=130301 | title= OPIS Acquires GasBuddy| date= March 1, 2013| publisher= UCG |accessdate= 2013-08-12| quote= Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) has acquired GasBuddy, the mobile app and website relied on by more than 26 million motorists to pinpoint the most comprehensive and accurate gasoline prices at service stations and convenience stores across the U.S. and Canada.}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPIS is a UCG subsidiary established in 1977 as the ''Oil Express Newsletter'' and specializing in worldwide petroleum pricing and news for businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.opisnet.com/about/opis.aspx| title= About OPIS| publisher= OPIS |accessdate= 2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2016, [[IHS Markit|IHS]] acquired OPIS, separating from GasBuddy, which remained with UCG as a subsidiary company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.ihs.com/press-release/corporate/ihs-completes-acquisition-oil-price-information-service-opis|title=IHS Completes Acquisition of Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) {{!}} IHS Online Newsroom|website=press.ihs.com|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially only available in the United States and Canada, GasBuddy launched in Australia in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/gasbuddy-the-app-which-finds-you-the-cheapest-petrol-launches-in-australia-today-2016-3|title=GasBuddy, the app which finds you the cheapest petrol launches in Australia today|last=|first=|date=March 6, 2016|website=[[Business Insider]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2016, GasBuddy released a completely redesigned app available for iOS and Android devices, the first major redesign of the app since its release in 2010. GasBuddy also unveiled a new logo and launched GasBuddy Business Pages.

On August 28, 2017, GasBuddy launched a gas savings program, Pay with GasBuddy, that lets consumers save at gas stations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gasbuddy.com/NewsRoom/PressRelease/456?fvm=1|title=GasBuddy Unveils First-of-its-Kind Gasoline Savings Program Giving US Drivers a Discount on Virtually Every Gallon of Gas They Will Ever Pump|last=|first=|date=August 28, 2017|website=GasBuddy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heraldry of the World''' (or '''NGW''', for the original Dutch name Nederlandse GemeenteWapens (Dutch civic heraldry)) is an [[Internet]]-based [[heraldry|heraldic]] resource&lt;ref name="ngw.nl"/&gt;
. Its principal project is the Internet's largest website devoted to civic [[heraldry]], containing comprehensive information about all kinds of [[coats of arms]] of (local) government authorities, including countries, states, provinces, colonies, regions, districts, cities, towns and municipalities worldwide. In addition to these the site also has a large literature and reference list and a section on heraldic [[collector item]]s.

The site started as a Dutch language site on [[Netherlands|Dutch]] civic heraldry in 1996, and expanded rapidly to cover all countries in the world as "International civic heraldry", the present name was adopted in 2010. The main language changed to English and only the Dutch part is still largely in Dutch. The site is maintained by the webmaster, but the number of contributors is much larger. To facilitate contribution by others the site is being transferred since 2010 to a wiki-environment. When the transition is finished other users will be able to contribute directly.

== Website ==
The total number of pages on the website is over 70.000 and the number of images around 135.000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Special:Statistics|title=Statistics - Heraldry of the World|website=Ngw.nl|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest website of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldryclipart.com/clipart-links/clipart-links.html|title=Armorial Gold Heraldry Links|first=|last=Jobidon|website=Heraldryclipart.com|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/|title=Heraldry by Countries|website=Heraldica.org|accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high amount of material there is an editing backlog, causing some areas of the site to contain outdated information.

A very large part of the civic heraldry images used on Wikipedia originates from the site,&lt;ref&gt;search on 'ngw' in Wikipedia commons showed 7700 arms taken from the site, March 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; which is accepted as long as the appropriate template is used.

== Coat of arms ==
The site uses a logo based on the now obsolete arms of [[Aasiaat]] municipality in [[Greenland]], showing a spider web, which is an appropriate symbol for a website.

[[File:Humanistenbibliothek in Schlettstadt.jpg|thumb|The entrance portal of the library]]
The '''Humanist Library''' in [[Sélestat]] is one of the most important cultural treasures of [[Alsace]], France. According to a traditional saying, Alsace has three great treasures: [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] in [[Colmar]] and the Humanist Library in Sélestat.
Actually, there are in fact two [[Renaissance humanist]] libraries involved, the library of the Humanist School and the private library of the famous scholar, [[Beatus Rhenanus]] (1485–1547).

==The Library of the Humanist School==
[[File:Fr Sélestat Bibliothèque Humaniste Interior.jpg|thumb|Main reading room]]
[[File:Inside the Humanist Library of Sélestat.jpg|thumb|Library of Beatus Rhenanus with a bust of [[Johannes Mentelin]]]]
[[Image:BH Selestat 3.jpg|thumb|The oldest book in the library, a Merovingian manuscript from the 7th century]]
In 1441, the municipal authorities of Sélestat appointed [[Ludwig Dringenberg]], born in Westphalia, to be the leader of the local [[Latin school]]. The appointment proved to be a stroke of luck. Dringenberg turned out to be a gifted and committed educator, who had an open attitude toward intellectual trends of the time. Under his leadership emerged the first school on the [[Upper Rhine]] where Humanist thinking was fostered. His successors, Kraft Hofman (1477–1501), Hieronymus Gebwiler (1501–1509) and Hans Sapidus (1510–1525), knew how to increase the reputation of the school still further. Thus, the school was the training place of an entire generation of Alsatian Humanists. The school also had a library which steadily grew in extent through endowments and gifts (from [[Jakob Wimpfeling]] of Sélestat, among others).

==The Library of Beatus Rhenanus==
[[Beatus Rhenanus]] bequeathed his entire private library to his home city of Sélestat.&lt;ref name=staikos2012&gt;{{Citation |isbn = 9781584561828 |publication-place = New Castle, DE |publisher= Oak Knoll Press |year= 2012 |title = History of the Library in Western Civilization: From Petrarch to Michelangelo |author = Konstantinos Staikos }}&lt;/ref&gt; This library contained about 670 bound leather volumes at the time of this death in 1547, which Rhenanus had collected during his studies and his work in [[Strasbourg]], [[Basel]], [[Sorbonne|Paris]] and Sélestat. Even at that time, the library was of inestimable value, since books were only published in small numbers of copies and they were extremely expensive. The library of Beatus Rhenanus is the only larger Humanist library preserved virtually intact. Other large libraries, such as those of [[Erasmus von Rotterdam]] or [[Johannes Reuchlin]], were scattered after the deaths of their owners.

The Library of Beatus Rhenanus was inscribed in the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World]] Register in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-1/beatus-rhenanus-library/ Beatus Rhenanus Library] on the Memory of the World Project website&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Humanists of Sélestat==
The Alsatian Humanists closely associated with the expansion of the library include:
*[[Jakob Wimpfeling]] (1450–1528), theologian, historian and educator
*[[Martin Bucer|Martin Butzer]] (1491–1551), theologian, the "Alsatian Reformer"
*[[Jakob Spiegel]] (1483–1547), jurist, advisor to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]
*[[Hieronymus Gebwiler]] (1473–1545), vice-chancellor of the school
*[[Hans Sapidus]] (1490–1561), vice-chancellor of the school
*[[Jakob Taurellus]] (1524–1579), advisor to [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand I]]

==The Library today==
Since 1889, both libraries have been housed under a single roof in a former covered market near the Gothic [[St. George's Church, Sélestat|church of Saint George]]. The library is publicly accessible as a museum and the books can be consulted by scholars and researchers. The collection boasts as many as 550 [[Incunabulum|incunabula]], 460 ancient and modern [[manuscript]]s, 2,200 16th&amp;nbsp;century prints, 1,600 17th&amp;nbsp;century prints and 2,600 18th&amp;nbsp;century prints, including the [[Sélestat Lectionary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bh-selestat.fr/rubrique.php?id_rubrique=255 Figures and key dates on the library's website]&lt;/ref&gt; The rooms also display a collection of 15th and 16th century Upper-Rhenish religious paintings and sculpture.

'''Incorporation''' is a phenomenon by which a grammatical category, such as a [[verb]], forms a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] with its [[direct object]] ('''object incorporation''') or [[adverb]]ial modifier, while retaining its original [[syntax|syntactic]] function. The inclusion of a noun qualifies the verb, narrowing its scope rather than making reference to a specific entity.

Incorporation is central to many [[polysynthetic language]]s such as those found in North America, Siberia and northern Australia. However, [[polysynthesis]] does not necessarily imply incorporation (Mithun 2009); neither does the presence of incorporation in a language imply that that language is polysynthetic.

==Examples of incorporation==
===English===
Although incoroporation does not occur regularly, [[English language|English]] uses it sometimes:''breastfeed'', and [[direct object]] incorporation, as in ''babysit''. Etymologically, such verbs in English are usually &lt;!--always?--&gt; [[back-formation]]s: the verbs ''breastfeed'' and ''babysit'' are formed from the adjective ''breast-fed'' and the noun ''babysitter'' respectively. Incorporation and plain [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]] may be fuzzy categories: consider ''backstabbing'', ''name-calling'', ''axe murder''.

===Oneida===
The following example from [[Oneida language|Oneida]] ([[Iroquoian]]) illustrates noun incorporation.

{|border="0"  
|-
| colspan="10"|waʼkhninú: ne kanaktaʼ
|-
| waʼ-
| k-
| hninu-
| ':
| 
| ne
| 
| ka-
| nakt-
| aʼ
|-
| FACT-
| 1.SG-
| buy-
| PUNC
| 
| ne 
| 
| PREF-
| bed-
| SUF
|-
| colspan="10"|'I bought a bed.'
|}

In this example, the verbal root ''hninu'' appears with its usual verbal morphology: a factive marker (FACT), which very roughly translates as past tense, although this is not quite accurate; an agreement marker (1.SG), which tells us that the verb agrees with 1st person singular (the speaker); and an aspect marker, punctual (PUNC), which tells us that this is a completed event. The direct object ''ne kanaktaʼ'' follows the verb. The function of the particle ''ne'' is unclear. Note that the word for bed consists of a root ''nakt'' plus a prefix and a suffix. The notion of the root is important here, but the properties of the prefix and suffix do not matter for this discussion.

The following sentence means the same as above, but noun incorporation has taken place.

{|border="0"  
|-
| colspan="6"|waʼkenaktahninú:
|-
| waʼ-
| ke-
| nakt-
| a-
| hninu-
| ':
|-
| FACT-
| 1.SG-
| bed-
| EPEN-
| buy-
| PUNC
|-
| colspan="6"|'I bought a bed.'
|}

In this example, the root for bed ''nakt'' has ''incorporated'' into the verbal construction and appears before the verbal root. Two other incidental changes are noticed here. First, the agreement marker in the first example is ''k'' and in the second example is ''ke''. These are two phonologically-conditioned allomorphs. In other words, the choice between using ''k'' and ''ke'' is based on the other sounds in the word (and has nothing to do with noun incorporation). Also, there is an [[epenthetic]] vowel ''a'' between the nominal and verbal roots. This vowel is inserted to break up an illegal consonant cluster (and also has nothing to do with noun incorporation).

===Panare===
The next example, from [[Panare language|Panare]], illustrates the cross-linguistically common phenomenon that the incorporated form of a noun may be significantly different from its unincorporated form.  The first sentence contains the incorporated form ''u&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' of "head", and the second its unincorporated form ''ipu'':

{| cellpadding="4"
|(1)||''y-u'-kïti-ñe''||''amën''
|-
| ||3-head-cut-&lt;small&gt;NONPERF.TRANS&lt;/small&gt;||2&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| || colspan="2"|"You head-cut it."
|}

{| cellpadding="4"
|(2)||''y-ipu-n||yï-kïti-ñe||amën''
|-
| ||3-head-&lt;small&gt;POSS&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;TRNS&lt;/small&gt;-cut-&lt;small&gt;NONPERF.TRNS&lt;/small&gt;||2&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| || colspan="3"|"You cut its head."
|}

===Chukchi===
[[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], a [[Paleosiberian language]] spoken in North Eastern Siberia, provides a wealth of examples of noun incorporation. The phrase ''təpelarkən qoraŋə'' means "I'm leaving the reindeer" and has two words (the verb in the first person singular, and the noun). The same idea can be expressed with the single word ''təqorapelarkən'', in which the noun root ''qora-'' "reindeer" is incorporated into the verb word.

===Mohawk===
[[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]], makes heavy use of incorporation, as in: ''watia'tawi'tsherí:io'' "it is a good shirt", where the noun [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''atia'tawi'' "upper body garment" is present inside the verb.

===Cheyenne===
[[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]], an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] of the plains, also uses noun incorporation on a regular basis. Consider ''nátahpe'emaheona'', meaning "I have a big house", which contains the noun morpheme ''maheo'' "house".

===Chinese (Mandarin)===
[[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] makes extensive use of ''verb-object compounds'', which are compounds composed of two constituents having the syntactic relation of verb and its direct object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Charles N.|last2=Thompson|first2=Sandra A.|title=Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar|date=1989|publisher=University of California Press|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the verb ''shuì-jiào'' 睡觉 'sleep (VO)' is composed of the verb ''shuì'' 睡 'sleep (V)' and the bound morpheme object ''jiào'' 觉 'sleep (N)'. Aspect markers (e.g. ''le'' 了 PERFECTIVE), classifier phrases (e.g. 三個鐘頭 ''sān ge zhōngtóu'' THREE + CL + hours), and other elements may separate the two constituents of these compounds, though different verb-object compounds vary in degree of separability.

==Semantics of noun incorporation==
In many cases, a phrase with an incorporated noun carries a different meaning with respect to the equivalent phrase where the noun is not incorporated into the verb. The difference seems to hang around the generality and definiteness of the statement. The incorporated phrase is usually generic and indefinite, while the non-incorporated one is more specific.

In [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]], for example, the phrase "I chopped a tree", when the word for "tree" is incorporated, changes its meaning to "I chopped wood". In [[Lahu language|Lahu]] (a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman language]]), the definite phrase "I drink the liquor" becomes the more general "I drink liquor" when "liquor" is incorporated. The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] phrase 目を覚ます ''me o samasu'' means "to wake up" or literally ''to wake (one's) eyes''. But when the direct object is incorporated into the nominal form of the verb, the resulting noun 目覚まし ''mezamashi'' literally means "waking up", as in 目覚まし時計　''mezamashidokei'' meaning "alarm clock."

This tendency is not a rule. There are languages where noun incorporation does not produce a meaning change (though it may cause a change in [[syntax]] &amp;mdash; as explained below).

==Syntax of noun incorporation==
Noun incorporation usually deletes one of the [[verb argument|arguments]] of the verb, and in some languages this is shown explicitly. That is, if the verb is transitive, the verb word with an incorporated direct object becomes formally intransitive and marked as such. In other languages this change does not take place, or at least it is not shown by explicit morphology.

In [[Lakota language|Lakhota]], a [[Siouan languages|Siouan language]] of the plains, for example, the phrase "the man is chopping wood" can be expressed either as a transitive ''wičháša kiŋ čháŋ kiŋ kaksáhe'' ("man the wood the chopping") or as an intransitive ''wičháša kiŋ čhaŋkáksahe'' ("man the wood-chopping") in which the independent nominal ''čháŋ'', "wood," becomes a root incorporated into the verb: "wood-chopping."

The noun may not be deleted after all.  In the [[Oneida language]] (an [[Iroquoian language]] spoken in Southern Ontario and Wisconsin), one finds '''classifier noun incorporation''', in which a generic noun acting as a direct object can be incorporated into a verb, but a more specific direct object is left in place.  In a rough translation, one would say for example "I animal-bought this pig", where "animal" is the generic incorporated noun.  Note that this "classifier" is not an actual [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] (i.e. a class agreement morpheme) but a common noun.

==Incorporation in diachronic perspective==

As proposed by Mithun (1984), one of the major origins of incorporation is  coalescence between noun and verb. Another proposed origin is the [[denominal verb|denominal]] derivation of a nominal compound containing a noun root and a verb root (Jacques 2012).

In 1985, Mithun also introduced a four type system to define the functionality and progression of noun incorporation in a language. The first and simplest type, known as lexical compounding, involves a verb incorporating a nominal argument. The resulting compound usually describes a noteworthy or recurring activity. The second type uses the same process to manipulate case roles, incorporating the argument into the verb to allow for a new argument to take its place. Type III uses noun incorporation to background old or established information. A speaker might explicitly mention an entity once, for example, and thereafter refer to it using an incorporated verbal compound. The fourth and final type proposed by Mithun involves the development of a set of classificatory compounds, in which verbs are paired with generic nouns to describe properties of an entity, rather than the entity itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mithun|first=Marianne|date=1985|title=Diachronic morphologization: The circumstances surrounding the birth, growth and decline of noun incorporation|url=|journal=Papers from the Sixth International Conference on Historical Linguistics.|series=Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 6|publisher=John Benjamins-Adam Mickiewicz University|volume=|pages=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type was previously mentioned as a feature of the [[Oneida language]].

According to Mithun, languages exhibiting any of these types always display all of the lower types as well. This seems to imply a pattern of progression, as Mithun describes in her 1984 paper on the evolution of noun incorporation.

Incorporation can in its turn change into other constructions, such as denominal derivation, applicative, directional affixes (Mattisen 2006, Mithun 2009)

{{nihongo|'''''Kaze no Klonoa: Moonlight Museum'''''|風のクロノア ムーンライトミュージアム|| Kaze no Kuronoa Muunraito Myuujiamu, "Klonoa of the Wind: Moonlight Museum"}} is a [[video game]] developed by [[Namco]] and published by [[Bandai]], released in Japan for the [[WonderSwan]] in 1999. It is the first handheld game in the ''[[Klonoa]]'' series to place him in a fully two-dimensional world, and established the system that his [[Game Boy Advance]] titles later used.

==Story==
Taking place sometime before ''[[Klonoa: Door to Phantomile]]'', Klonoa's first game, ''Kaze no Klonoa: Moonlight Museum'' stars Klonoa and his friend Huepow as they come across a young crying girl who tells them that the [[moon]] has been divided into fragments and stolen by a mysterious group of artists that reside in the nearby Moonlight Museum. Determined to help, the duo rush off to the Museum's entrance, and once they come inside, they are greeted by a painter named Picoo who traps them inside a piece of artwork. Klonoa and Huepow must fight their way through five worlds within the Museum itself before finding the source of all their troubles and restoring the moon to the sky.

==Gameplay==
Setting the standard for all the future ''Klonoa'' handheld titles, ''Moonlight Museum'' displays several standard features for an action [[sidescroller]]. The player controls Klonoa as he runs, jumps, and fights his way across several worlds, solving small puzzles in the process. Klonoa defeats enemies by picking them up using a special weapon called the "wind bullet", a ring-shaped object inlaid with a small blue jewel that can fire a small burst of wind straight forward and draw in an enemy, allowing for Klonoa to pick them up over his head. Once he has them, Klonoa can either throw them straight forward, taking out any enemies they happen to hit, or use them to perform a double jump, giving him access to places he otherwise could not reach. Also, by holding the jump button, Klonoa can hover in midair for a short duration by flapping his large ears, which also slightly increases his jump distance.

By completing all five worlds and beating the game, Klonoa can access special bonus stages called "EX Stages".

The game itself is divided into five worlds, each of which is split into six stages called "visions". At the end of each stage, Klonoa must find a door which is unlocked by finding all 3 stars within the vision itself. There are also 30 crystals (or "dream stones") in each vision, collect all these to finish part of the picture shown at the end of the vision (one picture per world). In addition, Klonoa can also find hearts that can replenish his health, as well as 1-up items that look like Klonoa's hat. There are no boss battles in this game.

==Development==
''Moonlight Museum'' was announced a month before its release in April 1999 as a side-story to the original ''Klonoa: Door to Phantomile'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/klonoa-moonlight-museum-2451557 |publisher=GameSpot |author=Mielke, James |date=1999-04-08 |title=Klonoa: Moonlight Museum |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was in development simultaneously with ''[[Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]], with the production of both games headed by [[Hideo Yoshizawa]]. While the ''Klonoa 2'' team focused more on "action", ''Moonlight Museum''{{'}}s crew was instructed to focus on the "puzzle" aspect, a trend that would continue for subsequent handheld games in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Champion of Dreams: An Interview with Hideo Yoshizawa |url=http://www.1up.com/features/champion-dreams-interview-hideo-yoshizawa |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=2012-09-20 |accessdate=2013-03-27 |author=Parish, Jeremy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223212713/http://www.1up.com/features/champion-dreams-interview-hideo-yoshizawa |archivedate=2013-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{Video game reviews
|IGN = 6 / 10&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web |author=Williamson, Colin |date=2000-04-13 |title=Klonoa: Moonlight Museum (Import) |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/14/klonoa-moonlight-museum-import | publisher=IGN |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

''Kaze no Klonoa: Moonlight Museum'' entered the Japanese sales charts as the 10th best-selling game during its debut week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carless, Simon |date=1999-06-11 |title=Dreamcast Desperation? |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/newswire/mgt_report/19990611.htm |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2008-10-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624133802/http://www.gamasutra.com/newswire/mgt_report/19990611.htm |archivedate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of an import version in 2000, [[IGN]] called the title "a WonderSwan platformer that's cute, cuddly... and painfully average" finding the level design to be "decent (if not a little dull)" and visuals that didn't push the limits of the handheld. The website remarked that the title could be played equally well on the WonderSwan's horizontal or vertical display modes, and the audio was "decidedly above-average" despite limited background music.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;

'''KODAKCoin''' is a photographer-oriented [[blockchain]] cryptocurrency used for payments for licensing photographs. The [[initial coin offering]] (ICO) was scheduled for January 31, 2018, but was delayed for several weeks so that accredited investors could be validated.&lt;ref name=Lahman /&gt;

In May 2018, the company announced that it would offer Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), and that investors would not receive tokens until the KodakONE product is complete.&lt;ref&gt;https://bitsonline.com/kodak-finally-launch-token-sale-but-is-it-legal/&lt;/ref&gt; According to KODAK, KODAKCoins will be issue by July 1, 2019 unless, in the opinion of its legal counsel, "KODAKCoin tokens will not be deemed to be “securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act."&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web | url=https://kodakone.com/ico/faq.html | title=KODAKOne FAQ | accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicting statements about operational status of WENN Digital and ownership of subsidiaries==
In the initial press release about the KodakOne project published by Eastman Kodak on January 9, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=KODAK and WENN Digital Partner to Launch Major Blockchain Initiative and Cryptocurrency |url=https://www.kodak.com/corp/press_center/kodak_and_wenn_digital_partner_to_launch_major_blockchain_initiative_and_cryptocurrency/default.htm |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; WENN Digital is described as having a "live operational copyright infringement management system" that "is delivering revenues to photographers worldwide today" and leveraging "the market position of its 30-year old subsidiary WENN Media, which works with approximately 2,500 professional photographers". German media report on March 21, after a conversation with WENN Digital CEO Jan Denecke that his Berlin-based startup RYDE GmbH, which according to the White Paper released by WENN Digital (dated April 24, 2018)&lt;ref name=Whitepaper&gt;{{cite web |title=White Paper |url=https://kodakone.com/fileadmin/white_paper/180424_kodakone_wp.pdf |website=kodakone.com |publisher=WENN Digital}}&lt;/ref&gt; builds a technological core of the KodakOne platform, was "meanwhile majority-owned by WENN Digital".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Max |first1=Borowski |title=Berliner Startup erlebt Hype und Häme |url=https://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/Berliner-Startup-erlebt-Hype-und-Haeme-article20317585.html |website=n-tv.de |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last ICO White Paper version before the beginning of the ICO on 21 May 2018 it is stated that WENN Media and RYDE GmbH are not owned by WENN Digital but are only to be purchased under certain conditions. It is also stated that WENN Digital does not have any operational business: "WENN Digital is a newly formed Delaware corporation which has no operating history and will not have any operations unless and until the consummation of the business combination transactions described in the Offering Memorandum between it, WENN Media and Ryde. The closing of each of these acquisitions is conditioned upon, among other things, WENN Digital’s receipt of $10 million in proceeds from the offerings on or before July 31, 2018. There can be no assurance that the closing conditions will be met and that the business combination with WENN Media and Ryde will be consummated."&lt;ref name=Whitepaper /&gt;

[[File:2014 world map of countries by Global Militarization Index.svg|300px|thumb|Mapped results by country, where dark shades show a higher GMI]]
The '''list of countries by Global Militarization Index''' is based on the 2014 Global Militarization Index of the [[Bonn International Center for Conversion]].

==Global Militarization Index==
The Global Militarization Index (GMI) depicts the relative weight and importance of the military apparatus of one state in relation to its society as a whole. For this, the GMI uses a number of indicators to represent the degree of militarization of a country:&lt;ref name="GlobeMil"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gmi.bicc.de/uploads/pdf/GMI_Daten_2013_e.pdf | title=Global Militarization Index | work=2013 Fact Sheet | accessdate= 6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Military Expenditure Index Score: comparison of military expenditure with its gross domestic product (GDP) and its health expenditure (as share of its GDP);
* People Index Score: contrast between the total number of (para)military forces with the number of physicians, and the overall population;
* Heavy Weapons Index Score: ratio of the number of heavy weapons available and the overall population.

'''Memory Alpha''' is a [[wiki]] encyclopedia for topics related to the ''[[Star Trek]]'' fictional universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|first=James |last=Barron|title=It's an Auction, Jim, but Not as We Know It |date=July 6, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/nyregion/06trek.html?ex=1152849600&amp;en=bb5649b7462124bc&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It's a wiki world |first=Ivor |last=Tossell |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070112.gtweb12/BNStory/Technology/?page=rss&amp;id=RTGAM.20070112.gtweb12 |date=January 12, 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The (mostly) wonderful world of Wikis. |work=Contra Costa Times |agency=Knight-Ridder/Tribune News Service |first=Ellen |last=Lee |date=December 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;no byline (October 14, 2006). "Web watch: Star Trek sites abound", ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]'', p. F1&lt;/ref&gt; Conceived by Harry Doddema and Dan Carlson in September 2003 and officially launched on December 5 of that year, it uses the [[wiki]] model and is hosted by [[Wikia, Inc.]] on the [[MediaWiki]] software. Memory Alpha contains over 40,000 articles in its [[English language|English]] edition alone {{as of|June 2016|lc=yes}}, making it one of the [[List of wikis|largest wiki projects]]. The site is also available in several other languages,&lt;ref&gt;Crockett, Christine (September 17, 2006). "A 40-year 'Trek'", ''[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun Journal]]'', p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Esperanto language|Esperanto]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

==History==
Memory Alpha aims to create a comprehensive database for all fans, but was not conceived as a wiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ebersbach | first = Anja | title = Wiki: Web Collaboration | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | date = 2008 | isbn = 3-540-35150-7 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two concerns spurred its creation: many ''Star Trek'' references of the time were incomplete, and the most promising would shut down regularly, like the site TrekPulse, which closed inexplicably in late 2005 to be reborn the next year as TrekCore. Doddema and Carlson christened their project Memory Alpha, after the Federation's largest information archive, from the original series episode "[[The Lights of Zetar]]".

The two decided on a wiki format, which allowed for more collaboration than other formats available. As Carlson said in the Charlotte Observer, "The idea I latched onto with the wiki concept is you can spread the work around. Everyone can pitch in and go in on their own special interest." After experimenting with [[TikiWiki]] software, they switched to the [[MediaWiki]] platform, finding it less cumbersome. The platform of choice for [[Wikimedia Foundation]] projects proved to be, in their opinion, more stable and efficient, and they brought a testsite online on November 11, 2003. Memory Alpha officially launched on December 5 that year.

The site gained momentum in the following months, aided by a mention on the ''Star Trek'' fan site "TrekNation" on December 23. Memory Alpha reached 1,000 articles by January 12, 2004, but on March 23, the site's [[database]] was accidentally erased during an upgrade of the MediaWiki [[software]]. Although this caused six weeks of work to be lost, the project expanded to include Dutch and German versions on April 10 and May 14 respectively. It remained stable until the following year, when the fees associated with hosting the site became more than the founders could afford.

In February 2005, Memory Alpha switched hosting servers and joined [[Wikia]], a free for-profit wiki-hosting company started by Wikimedia Foundation board members [[Jimmy Wales]] and Angela Beesley. The site remained stable on Wikia, opening a Swedish site on May 5 and a French one on November 5. It also received several distinctions that year, such as the ''Ex Astris Excellentia'' award from [[Ex Astris Scientia]], a ''Star Trek'' reference site, in September 2005, and it was featured as the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel's]] Site of the Week for October 10, 2005.&lt;ref name=scifi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue442/site.html|work=[[SciFi.com]]|title=Sci-Fi Site of the Week|date=October 10, 2005 |first=Ken |last=Newquist}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' writer/producer Mike Sussman joined the community that year as well.&lt;ref&gt;Some (but not all) of Memory Alpha's distinctions can be found on Memory Alpha's [[MemoryAlpha:Memory Alpha:Announcements|announcements page]]. Among the announcements are links to the [http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/our_award.htm Ex Astris Excellentia award] and [http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue442/site.html SciFi newsletter]. Mr. Sussman's identity on Memory Alpha has been verified as authentic; see his [[MemoryAlpha:User:Mdsussman|talk page]] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical issues led the MediaWiki software to believe Memory Alpha was started on November 23, 2004, and despite the inaccuracy, this date was adopted ''[[ex post facto]]'' as Memory Alpha's "birthday".

The latter part of 2005 and early 2006 saw several new features added to the site. Among these was a [[peer review]] process, implemented on September 21, 2005 in response to questions about the process by which articles become featured.&lt;ref&gt;The issue at hand was originally raised by user AJHalliwell on July 15 of that year, and a subsequent [http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Memory_Alpha_talk:Featured_article_nomination_policy#.22...community.27s_work....22 discussion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301122524/http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Memory_Alpha_talk:Featured_article_nomination_policy#.22...community.27s_work....22 |date=2006-03-01 }} resulted in the creation of Memory Alpha's [[MemoryAlpha:Memory Alpha:Peer review|Peer Review]] section. According to the [http://memory-alpha.org/en/index.php?title=Memory_Alpha:Peer_review&amp;action=history page history] of the Peer Review page, it was created by user Cid Highwind at 22:53, 21 September 2005 [[UTC]].&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20 of that year, Memory Alpha began a "Babel" program, inspired by and modeled after that of the [[Wikimedia Commons]], to help users who speak the same language. Other recent innovations include an area for user projects, sometimes referred to as [[Wikipedia:WikiProject|WikiProjects]] on other wikis, and coverage of [[fan film]]s.

The site has remained popular since its inception, although its growth has slowed in recent times. For instance, it was the largest project on Wikia&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Cynthia (September 1, 2005). "Wiki, mania", ''[[Florida Trend]]'' '''48''' (5): 62.&lt;/ref&gt; until October 2005, when its article count was surpassed by [[Wookieepedia]] and [[Uncyclopedia]]. Today,{{When|date=June 2010}} it has approximately 1300 registered users (80 of whom are active) and upwards of 17 million page views since its move to Wikia. {{As of|2006|alt=As of February 2006}}, it receives on average, slightly more visitors and page views per day than the official ''Star Trek'' website according to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]].&lt;ref&gt;Any user count on Memory Alpha should be treated as prone to error because Memory Alpha's users are pooled with those of other Wikia sites. A full list of editors can be found on [[MemoryAlpha:Special:Activeusers|Memory Alpha's maintenance page]], but the estimate of 80 users is based on a [[MemoryAlpha:Memory Alpha:Archivists|voluntary listing]] of users (who call themselves "archivists"). Page views, which are easier to gauge, can be found on the [[MemoryAlpha:Special:Statistics|statistics page]]. The Alexa claim is based on a [http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;compare_sites=startrek.com&amp;y=p&amp;q=&amp;url=memory-alpha.org page view comparison] on February 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Memory Alpha has influenced the design of other wikicities dedicated to information about television franchises, including [[Wikicities:c:x-files|The X-Files Wiki]] [http://x-files.wikia.com/wiki/X-Files_Wiki:About] and the [[Wikicities:c:24|24 Wiki]] [http://24.wikia.com/wiki/Wiki_24:About]. It is a resource used by mainstream journalists for information on ''Star Trek'' related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Barron, James "It's an Auction, Jim, But Not as We Know It." New York Times. (Late Edition (East Coast)). New York, N.Y.: Jul 6, 2006. pg. B.3&lt;/ref&gt; Influential edublogger [[Will Richardson]] hailed the site in his 2006 book ''Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms'' as "one of the most impressive [wikis] out there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Richardson | first = Will | title = Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms | publisher = Corwin Press | location = Thousand Oaks | date = 2006 | isbn = 1-4129-2767-6 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2007, Memory Alpha reached a milestone of 25,000 articles with the creation of the article [[MemoryAlpha:Robert Iscove|Robert Iscove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://memory-alpha.org/en/index.php?title=Forum:MA_Press_Release&amp;t=20070613163046 |title=Forum:MA Press Release - Memory Alpha, the Star Trek Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013185931/http://memory-alpha.org/en/index.php?title=Forum:MA_Press_Release&amp;t=20070613163046 |archive-date=2007-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named Memory Alpha one of the 25 Essential Fansites in 2007. In comparing it to other ''Star Trek'' sites, the reviewer wrote, "Memory Alpha wins out for its handsome, intuitive presentation and its overwhelming mass".&lt;ref&gt;Vary, Adam B. (December 28, 2007). "[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20165619_20165621_20167049_15,00.html 25 Essential Fansites]", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' 971: T9.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed in April 2016 that actor and writer for ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'', [[Simon Pegg]], used Memory Alpha as a canon resource in writing of the film, even asking the community's leaders to name and give etymology for a device in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/simon-pegg-got-help-from-the-star-trek-fan-wiki-while-w-1771866467|title=Gizmodo|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://trekcore.com/blog/2015/07/simon-pegg-memory-alpha-star-trek-beyond/|title=Trek Core|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2016/04/19/simon-pegg-got-help-from-memory-alpha-writers-on-star-trek-beyond-script/|title=Spinoff Online|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Several aspects of Memory Alpha set it apart from other reference works, such as its method of citing sources. All information must be cited from a valid source (see [[Memory Alpha#Canon policy|Canon]] section below), but rather than a "Works Cited" or "References" list, Memory Alpha prefers stand-alone inline citations, which are placed in parentheses after the sentence or section in question. For television episodes, this consists of an abbreviation for the series from which the information came (e.g. DS9 for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''), followed by the name of the episode in double quotation marks. So, to cite information from the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (TNG) pilot "[[Encounter at Farpoint]]", one would add: (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint"). The same rule applies for films, without the series prefix and with italics in place of quotation marks. The same method of notation is also used in the printed ''[[Star Trek Encyclopedia]]'', which is unrelated to the Memory Alpha wiki.

Articles on Memory Alpha are written from two points of view: "in-universe", which are written as if the reader is a part of the ''Star Trek'' universe, and "production", which speak from a real-world perspective. For "in-universe" articles, behind-the-scenes information is not included in the main body of the article; rather, it is placed in a separate background section or included indented and italicized to separate it from the in-universe perspective. The latter method is used in cases where either the information is particularly important (such as conflicting information from two canonical sources) or there is not enough background to justify a separate section. In most cases, the background method is preferred and italics are used sparingly.

Like many wikis, Memory Alpha has a section for "featured articles", those believed to represent the best the community has to offer.&lt;ref name=scifi/&gt; The criteria for this distinction are that an article must be well written, comprehensive (which includes citing sources), accurate and undisputed &amp;ndash; criteria any article could hypothetically fulfill. This has caused some conflict over the criteria involved (see [[Memory Alpha#Current issues|Current issues]] section). To be featured, an article must be nominated by a user and unanimously supported by at least five other users; any objections must be fixable and may be invalidated if deemed irrational or unreasonable. Each week, one of the site's featured articles becomes the "Article of the Week" to be displayed on the project home page.

Several methods of communication are available beyond conventional talk pages. The "community portal" section of the website is named after [[Ten Forward]], a locale frequented by characters on ''The Next Generation''. Issues discussed there range from disputes between users to new ideas on how to improve the site to upcoming projects. A separate area, the [[reference desk]], exists for discussions and questions related to what is considered part of the canon, discrepancies between sources, and other such topics. However, "meta-Trek" topics (a term used for ''Star Trek''-related topics that do not pertain in any way to Memory Alpha) are not discussed on the wiki; a separate [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] chatroom exists for these discussions.

==Canon policy==
The question of canonicity is a complex one and has plagued fans since ''Star Trek'' began in 1966.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The general policy of [[Paramount Pictures]] is that anything outside live-action television episodes and movies is [[apocrypha]]l, or non-canonical.&lt;ref&gt;Startrek.com states in an [http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/help/faqs/faq/676.html FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628174255/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/help/faqs/faq/676.html |date=2010-06-28 }} dated 10 September 2003, "Story lines, characters, events, stardates, etc. that take place within the fictional novels, the Animated Adventures, and the various comic lines are not canon." However, even the FAQ acknowledges certain facts outside this rule have become canonical. It should also be noted that the FAQ is meant as a rule of thumb and is not an official rule.&lt;/ref&gt; However, grey areas in this policy, especially in relation to the canonical status of ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' (TAS), further complicate the matter and have led to many debates among fans. In light of this, Memory Alpha crafted its own unique definition of canon in relation to what may be used as a "valid resource". ''The Animated Series'' is included as valid, or canonical, for a number of reasons, such as the fact that ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] and most of the cast of [[Star Trek: The Original Series|the original series]] were involved with it and the existence of several references to TAS events in later series.

Information taken from the ''Star Trek Encyclopedia'' and ''Star Trek Chronology'' is mostly accepted on Memory Alpha as well, to the extent that it does not break from established on-screen facts. Content from these sources is an acknowledged grey area of Memory Alpha's canon policy and is disregarded if deemed speculative or contradictory. Thus, in some ways they hold the same weight as novels and other publications do for [[Star Wars canon]]: a "second tier" of canonicity, which is subservient to primary (on-screen) sources.

Other sources such as books and computer games are not included as canonical, but are covered by Memory Alpha in a way which sets it apart from other ''Trek'' resources: books, comics, and other products are included as articles about the products (i.e. from a "production point of view"), but "in-universe" information unique or new to them is covered on the product page. For example, in the ''[[Star Trek: New Frontier]]'' line of books, a new host of characters is introduced to the Trek universe, and their vessel is known as the USS ''Excalibur''. The characters, ships and information from ''New Frontier'' books do not receive pages of their own, but they are covered on the pages about the books. In this way, Memory Alpha remains all-inclusive while attempting to distinguish the canon from apocryphal material.

Non-canonical characters and topics are instead covered at [[Wikia:memory-beta:Main Page|Memory Beta]], and fan-films and other fan-created material at [[Wikia:stexpanded:Main Page|Star Trek Expanded Universe]]; both are hosted by Wikia. [http://stowiki.org/ The Star Trek Online Wiki], hosted by curse.com, covers the [[Star Trek Online]] [[MMORPG]].

==Issues==
===Organizational===
&lt;!--{{Section OR|date=September 2007}} is not necessary, see WP:SELFPUB.--&gt;
Several issues face the Memory Alpha community, one of which is the question of which articles should be given "featured" status. Under Memory Alpha's current policies, both major and minor topics are eligible; however, the question has been raised of whether the criteria for featuring should be more subjective, i.e., if a topic is not significant enough, it should not be featured regardless of how comprehensive its article is.&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates Noah's [[MemoryAlpha:Talk:Hippocrates Noah|archived nomination]] for featured status can be found on Memory Alpha. There was an unprecedented level of debate associated with the nomination.
&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consensus in the Memory Alpha community about the topic, although there has been no change in featuring policy.

The question of what content Memory Alpha should cover has plagued the project since its creation. On the project's home page, it describes itself as "a collaborative project to create the most definitive, accurate, and accessible encyclopedia and reference for everything related to ''Star Trek''", but fans often have different interpretations of what "everything" means. Sometimes, one or more users may add content about a subject &amp;ndash; such as a website, fan club or parody &amp;ndash; that does not fit existing pages, necessitating a community decision about whether to keep the content and, if so, what to do with it. Such incidents led to the creation of an article on ''Star Trek'' parodies after several questions were raised about where to put information related to, but not a part of, the ''Star Trek'' franchise. An example of the reverse case is "The Sunspots", a musical group consisting of [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Jonathan Frakes]], [[LeVar Burton]] and [[Michael Dorn]]. Although the actors involved were all prominent parts of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', several articles on the group have been deleted because the community deemed the topic not directly related to the franchise. {{As of|2006}}, information about The Sunspots can be found on the different actors' pages rather than a single, separate article.

Perhaps the most heated issue on Memory Alpha in recent years is the controversy surrounding their canon policy. Aside from issues of length and excessive use of [[legalese]], this policy has been put into question by several of the site's regular users because of its rule that articles and information which were not seen on-screen but were derived from official production sources are not considered canonical on Memory Alpha. The site's archivists are divided as to exactly whether such information should be allowed as canonical; some want only to allow what was seen on-screen while others wish to include that which was originally intended to be used on-screen but never made it, such as information from deleted scenes, early script drafts, etc. The latter archivists believe that such information can be included so long as it does not contradict what was seen on-screen and so long as it states where the source of the information comes from. {{As of|2006|07}}, this debate has died down significantly, with most having accepted the terms of the new policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Memory_Alpha:Canon_policy |title=Memory Alpha:Canon policy - Memory Alpha, the Star Trek Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2006-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810142017/http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Memory_Alpha:Canon_Policy |archive-date=2006-08-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite early concern about how to incorporate information from the 2009 movie ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', which is considered a semi-reboot of the original series, Memory Alpha members found a solution to the issue. All information from this film is recorded as separate articles, which are titled according to their subject with the term "alternate reality" included in the title. This is from the term used in the movie itself to describe the new continuity. For example, the article ''Nyota Uhura'' discusses the character as portrayed by [[Nichelle Nichols]], while the article ''Nyota Uhura (alternate reality)'' discusses the character as played by [[Zoe Saldana]].

'''Nativism''' is the political policy of promoting the interests of [[Native born|native]] inhabitants against those of [[immigrant]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.dictionary.com/browse/nativism|title= the definition of nativism|website= Dictionary.com|access-date= 2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; including by supporting [[opposition to immigration|immigration-restriction]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Migration Between States and Markets|publisher= Ashgate|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0-7546-4231-2|pages= 19–27|chapter= The Rise and Fall of the New Nativism: Economic Forces, Ethnic Politics and US Immigration Policy|author= Max J.

In scholarly studies ''nativism'' is a standard technical term. Those who hold this political view, however, do not typically accept the label. Dindar (2009) wrote, "nativists... do not consider themselves as nativists. For them it is a negative term and they rather consider themselves as '[[Patriotism|Patriots]]'".&lt;ref&gt;

== Arguments for immigration restriction ==
{{main article|Opposition to immigration}}

According to Fetzer (2000), opposition to immigration commonly arises in many countries because of issues of national, cultural, and religious [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. The phenomenon has been studied especially in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]], as well as in continental [[Europe]]. Thus nativism has become a general term for "[[opposition to immigration]]" based on fears that the immigrants will distort or spoil existing [[cultural values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=Joel S.|last=Fetzer|title=Economic self-interest or cultural marginality? Immigration restrictionist sentiment and nativist political movements in France, Germany and the USA|work=''Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies''|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 2000|pages=5–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In situations where immigrants greatly outnumber the original inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;D. Groenfeldt, "The future of indigenous values: cultural relativism in the face of economic development," ''Futures'' Volume 35, Issue 9, November 2003, pp. 917–29&lt;/ref&gt; nativistic movements can allow cultural survival. The claim that immigrants can "swamp" a local population is related to [[birth rate]] relative to nationals. Contemporary opponents of immigration blame it for such problems as [[unemployment]], [[crime]] (especially through gangs), harm to the [[Natural environment|environment]], housing shortage, and overwhelming social services such as hospitals, police.

Immigration restrictionist sentiment is typically justified with one or more of the following arguments and claims about immigrants:&lt;ref&gt;Anbinder, (2006); Barkan, (2003); Betz, (2007); Higham, (1955); Lucassen, (2005); Palmer, (1992); and Schrag, (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Government spending|Government expense]]: Government expenses may exceed tax revenue relating to new immigrants.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/admin/books/files/Immigration.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614054729/http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/admin/books/files/Immigration.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Language: Isolate themselves in their own communities and refuse to learn the local language.
* Employment: Acquire jobs that would have otherwise been available to native citizens, depressing native employment; create an oversupply of labor, depressing wages.
* Patriotism: Damage a sense of community and nationality.
* Environment: Increase the consumption of scarce resources; their move from low- to high-pollution economies increases pollution.
* [[Social welfare provision|Welfare]]: Make heavy use of social welfare systems.
* [[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]]: May overpopulate countries.
* Culture: Can swamp a native population and replace its culture with their own.
* Housing: Increase in housing costs: migrant families can reduce vacancies and cause rent increases.

==By country==
===Australia===
Many Australians opposed the influx of Chinese immigrants at time of the nineteenth-century gold rushes. When the separate Australian colonies formed the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the new nation adopted "[[White Australia policy|White Australia]]" as one of its founding principles. Under the White Australia policy, entry of Chinese and other Asians remained controversial until well [[Post-war|after World War II]], although the country remained home to many long-established Chinese families dating from before the adoption of White Australia. By contrast, most [[Pacific Islander|Pacific Islanders]] were deported soon after the policy was adopted, while the remainder were forced out of the canefields where they had worked for decades.&lt;ref&gt;After 1905, 4000 "Kanakas" were repatriated and the remaining 2500 were pushed out of the canefields by labour unions.
Doug Munro, "The Labor Trade in Melanesians to Queensland: An Historiographic Essay," ''Journal of Social History'', Vol. 28, No. 3 (Spring, 1995), pp. 609–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Hostility of native-born white Australians toward British and Irish immigrants in the late 19th century was manifested in a new party, the [[Australian Natives' Association]].&lt;ref name="Richard Jensen 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Blackton, "Australian Nationality and Nativism: The Australian Natives' Association, 1885–1901," ''Journal of Modern History'', Vol. 30, No. 1 (Mar., 1958), pp. 37–46 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1871916 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early 2000, opposition has mounted to [[Asylum seeker|asylum seekers]] arriving in boats from Indonesia.&lt;ref name="anti boat people"&gt;{{cite news| title=Boat people facing a wave of hatred| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/1338947/Boat-people-facing-a-wave-of-hatred.html| accessdate=7 September 2013| newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| location=London| date=30 August 2001| author=Dutter, Barbie| author2=Spillius, Alex| author3=Chapman, Paul| quote= ...it is these people – condemned as "queue-jumpers" by the public and politicians alike – who have pushed simmering resentment to boiling point.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
The Brazilian elite desired the [[racial whitening]] of the country, similarly to [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]]. The country encouraged European immigration, but non-white immigration always faced considerable backlash. On July 28, 1921, representatives Andrade Bezerra and Cincinato Braga proposed a law whose Article 1 provided: "The immigration of individuals from the black race to Brazil is prohibited." On October 22, 1923, representative Fidélis Reis produced another bill on the entry of immigrants, whose fifth article was as follows: "The entry of settlers from the black race into Brazil is prohibited. For Asian [immigrants] there will be allowed each year a number equal to 5% of those residing in the country.(...)".&lt;ref name="rios"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070808044737/http://www.movimentoafro.amazonida.com/branqueamento.htm RIOS, Roger Raupp. Text excerpted from a judicial sentence concerning crime of racism. Federal Justice of 10ª Vara da Circunscrição Judiciária de [[Porto Alegre]], November 16, 2001] (Accessed September 10, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were negative feelings toward the communities of [[German Brazilian|German]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italian]], [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]], and [[History of the Jews in Brazil|Jewish]] immigrants, who conserved their language and culture instead of adopting [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Brazilian culture|Brazilian habit]] (so that nowadays Brazil has the biggest communities in the Americas of speakers of [[German language|German]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), were seen as particularly tendentious to form ghettos, had high rates of [[endogamy]] (in Brazil, it is regarded as usual for people of different backgrounds to miscegenate), among other concerns.

It affected more harshly the Japanese, because they were Asian, and thus seen as an obstacle of the whitening of Brazil. Oliveira Viana, a Brazilian jurist, historian and sociologist described the Japanese immigrants as follows: "They (Japanese) are like sulfur: insoluble". The Brazilian magazine "O Malho" in its edition of December 5, 1908 issued a charge of Japanese immigrants with the following legend: "The government of São Paulo is stubborn. After the failure of the first Japanese immigration, it contracted 3,000 yellow people. It insists on giving Brazil a race diametrically opposite to ours".&lt;ref name="suzuki"&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/mais/fs2004200804.htm SUZUKI Jr, Matinas. História da discriminação brasileira contra os japoneses sai do limbo ''in'' Folha de S.Paulo, 20 de abril de 2008] (visitado em 17 de agosto de 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, the Brazilian Minister of Justice, Francisco Campos, defended the ban on admission of 400 Japanese immigrants in São Paulo and wrote: "their despicable standard of living is a brutal competition with the country's worker; their selfishness, their bad faith, their refractory character, make them a huge ethnic and cultural cyst located in the richest regions of Brazil".&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt;

Some years before World War II, the government of President [[Getúlio Vargas]] initiated a process of forced assimilation of people of immigrant origin in Brazil. The Constitution of 1934 had a legal provision about the subject: "The concentration of immigrants anywhere in the country is prohibited; the law should govern the selection, location and assimilation of the alien". The assimilationist project affected mainly German, Italian, Japanese and Jewish immigrants and their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/7018121/Memoria-Da-Imigracao-Japonesa-No-Brasil|title=Memória da Imigração Japonesa|website=scribd.com|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510202109/http://www.scribd.com/doc/7018121/Memoria-Da-Imigracao-Japonesa-No-Brasil|archivedate=10 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II they were seen as more loyal to their countries of origin than to Brazil. In fact, there were violent revolts in the Japanese community of the states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] when [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] declared that Japan surrendered and he was not a deity, which was thought as a conspiracy trying to hurt Japanese honor and strength. Nevertheless, it followed hostility from the government. The Japanese Brazilian community was strongly marked by restrictive measures when Brazil declared war against Japan in August 1942. Japanese Brazilians could not travel the country without [[safe conduct]] issued by the police; over 200 Japanese schools were closed and radio equipment was seized to prevent transmissions on short wave from Japan. The goods of Japanese companies were confiscated and several companies of Japanese origin had interventions, including the newly founded Banco América do Sul. Japanese Brazilians were prohibited from driving motor vehicles (even if they were taxi drivers), buses or trucks on their property. The drivers employed by Japanese had to have permission from the police. Thousands of Japanese immigrants were arrested or expelled from Brazil on suspicion of espionage. There were many anonymous denunciations because of "activities against national security" arising from disagreements between neighbours, recovery of debts and even fights between children.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt; Japanese Brazilians were arrested for "suspicious activity" when they were in artistic meetings or [[picnic]]s. On July 10, 1943, approximately 10,000 Japanese and German immigrants who lived in [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]] had 24 hours to close their homes and businesses and move away from the Brazilian coast. The police acted without any notice. About 90% of people displaced were Japanese. To reside in [[Baixada Santista]], the Japanese had to have a safe conduct.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt; In 1942, the Japanese community who introduced the cultivation of pepper in [[Tomé-Açu]], in [[Pará]], was virtually turned into a "concentration camp" (expression of the time) from which no Japanese could leave. This time, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, D.C., Carlos Martins Pereira e Sousa, encouraged the government of Brazil to transfer all the Japanese Brazilians to "internment camps" without the need for legal support, in the same manner [[Japanese American internment|as was done with the Japanese residents in the United States]]. No single suspicion of activities of Japanese against "national security" was confirmed.&lt;ref name="suzuki"/&gt;

Nowadays, nativism in Brazil affects primarily migrants from elsewhere in the [[Third World]], such as the new wave of [[Arab Brazilian|Levantine Arabs]] (this time, mostly Muslim from [[Palestinian Brazilian|Palestine]] instead of overwhelmingly [[Arab Christian|Christian]] from [[Syrian Brazilian|Syria]] and [[Lebanese Brazilian|Lebanon]]), South and [[Asian Brazilian|East Asians]] (primarily [[Chinese Brazilian|Mainland Chinese]]), Spanish-speakers and Amerindians [[Immigration from other South American countries to Brazil|from neighboring South American countries]] and, especially, West Africans and [[Haitian Brazilian|Haitians]]. Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] and considerable illegal immigration to [[North Region, Brazil|northern Brazil]] and São Paulo,&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.cartamaior.com.br/templates/materiaMostrar.cfm?materia_id=19281 Carta Maior – International News Section – Brazil, hope for Haitian illegal immigrants]&lt;/ref&gt; a subsequent debate in the population was concerned with the reasons why Brazil has such lax laws and enforcement concerning illegal immigration.

According to the 1988's [[Brazilian Constitution]], it is an unbailable crime to address someone in an offensive [[Racism|racist]] way, and it is illegal to discriminate someone on the basis of his or her race, skin color, national or regional origin or nationality (for more, see [[anti-discrimination laws in Brazil]]), thus nativism and opposition to multiculturalism would be too much of a polemic and delicate topic to be openly discussed as a basic ideology of even the most right-leaning modern [[List of political parties in Brazil|political parties]].

===Canada===
{{main article|Nationalism in Canada}}
Nativism was common in Canada (though the term originated in the U.S.). It took several forms. Hostility to the Chinese and other Asians was intense, and involved provincial laws that hindered immigration of Chinese and Japanese and blocked their economic mobility. [[Japanese Canadian internment|In 1942 Japanese Canadians were forced into detention camps]] in response to Japanese aggression in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;W. Peter Ward, ''White Canada Forever: Popular Attitudes and Public Policy toward Orientals in British Columbia'' (1978); Roger Daniels, ''Concentration Camps North America: Japanese in the United States and Canada During World War II'' (1993); {{cite journal |last = Laviolette |first = Forrest E. | title = Two years of Japanese evacuation in Canada | journal = Far Eastern Survey | volume = 13 | issue = 11 | pages = 93–100 | doi = 10.2307/3023407 | jstor = 3023407 | date = May 31, 1944 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th century, well into the 20th, the [[Orange Order in Canada]] attacked and tried to politically defeat the Irish Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil J. Houston and William J. Smyth, ''The Sash Canada Wore: A Historical Geography of the Orange Order in Canada'' (1980); {{cite journal |last = McLaughlin |first = Robert | title = Irish Nationalism and Orange Unionism in Canada: A Reappraisal | journal = Éire-Ireland | volume = 41 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 80–109 | doi = 10.1353/eir.2007.0009 | date = Fall–Winter 2006 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ku Klux Klan in Canada|Ku Klux Klan]] spread in the mid-1920s from the U.S. to parts of Canada, especially Saskatchewan, where it helped topple the Liberal government. The Klan creed was, historian Martin Robin argues, in the mainstream of Protestant Canadian sentiment, for it was based on "Protestantism, separation of Church and State, pure patriotism, restrictive and selective immigration, one national public school, one flag and one language—English."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Robin, ''Shades of Right: Nativist and Fascist Politics in Canada, 1920–1940'' (1991), quote on pp. 23–24. Robin p 86, notes the Klan in Canada was not violent.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard Jensen 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Jensen |first = Richard | title = Comparative nativism: the United States, Canada and Australia, 1880s–1910s | journal = Canadian Issues | pages = 45–55 | date = Spring 2009 | url = https://acs-aec.ca/en/publications/canadian-issues/borders-boundaries/buy-now/ | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada in World War I|World War I]], Canadian naturalized citizens of German or Austrian origins were stripped of their right to vote, and tens of thousands of Ukrainians (who were born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire) [[Ukrainian Canadian internment|were rounded up and put in internment camps]].&lt;ref&gt;Frances Swyripa and John Herd Thompson, eds. ''Loyalties in Conflict: Ukrainians in Canada During the Great War'' (1983); and Bohdan Kordan, ''Enemy Aliens, Prisoners of War: Internment in Canada During the Great War'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hostility of native-born Canadians to competition from English immigrants in the early 20th century was expressed in signs that read, "No English Need Apply!" The resentment came because the immigrants identified more with England than with Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Ross McCormack, "Cloth Caps and Jobs: The Ethnicity of English Immigrants in Canada, 1900–1914," in Jorgan Dahlie and Tissa Fernando, eds. ''Ethnicity, Power, and Politics in Canada'' (1981); Susan Jackel, '' A Flannel Shirt and Liberty: British Emigrant Gentlewomen in the Canadian West, 1880–1914'' (1982) p. xx; Basil Stewart, ''"No English Need Apply": Or, Canada as a Field for the Emigrant'' (1909)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[British Empire]], traditions of [[anti-Catholicism in Britain]] led to fears that Catholics were a threat to the national (British) values. In Canada, the Orange Order (of Irish Protestants) campaigned vigorously against the Catholics throughout the 19th century, often with violent confrontations. Both sides were immigrants from Ireland and neither side claimed loyalty to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Robert McLaughlin , "Irish Nationalism and Orange Unionism in Canada: A Reappraisal," Éire-Ireland 41.3&amp;4 (2007) 80–109;  Cecil J. Houston and William J. Smyth, ''The Sash Canada Wore: A Historical Geography of the Orange Order in Canada'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; The Orange Order was much less influential in the U.S., especially after [[Orange Riots|a major riot in New York City in 1871]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Allen Gordon|title=The Orange Riots: Irish Political Violence in New York City, 1870 and 1871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOZmKrjbSxsC&amp;pg=PA180|year=1993|publisher=Cornell U.P.|pages=180–84|isbn=978-0801427541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{further information|Localism in Hong Kong}}
Nativism in [[Hong Kong]] is often used as a synonymy with localism,&lt;ref name="timeout"&gt;{{cite news|title=Localism: Why is support for the political perspective growing – and who's behind it?|url=http://www.timeout.com.hk/big-smog/features/73236/localism-why-is-support-for-the-political-perspective-growing-and-whos-behind-it.html|date=1 July 2015|access-date=2016-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190314/http://www.timeout.com.hk/big-smog/features/73236/localism-why-is-support-for-the-political-perspective-growing-and-whos-behind-it.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which strives for the autonomy of Hong Kong and resist [[China]]'s authorities influence in the city. In addition to their strong [[anti-communist]] and [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pro-democracy]] tendency, It often holds a strong anti-mainland sentiments, especially the influx of the mainland [[Individual Visit Scheme|tourists]] and [[New immigrants in Hong Kong|immigrants]], seeing them as a threat to Hong Kong identity and culture.

===European countries===
For the Poles in the mining districts of western Germany before 1914, it was nationalism (on both the German and the Polish sides), which kept Polish workers, who had established an associational structure approaching institutional completeness (churches, voluntary associations, press, even unions), separate from the host German society. Lucassen found that religiosity and nationalism were more fundamental in generating nativism and inter-group hostility than the labor antagonism.

Once Italian workers in France had understood the benefit of [[Trade union|unionism]] and French unions were willing to overcome their fear of Italians as [[strikebreaker]]s, integration was open for most Italian immigrants. The French state, which was always more of an immigration state than Prussia, Germany or Great Britain, fostered and supported family-based immigration and thus helped Italians on their immigration trajectory with minimal nativism.&lt;ref name="Lucassen 2005"&gt;Lucassen 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Many observers see the post-1950s wave of immigration in Europe was fundamentally different from the pre-1914 patterns. They debate the role of cultural differences, ghettos, race, Muslim fundamentalism, poor education and poverty play in creating nativism among the hosts and a caste-type underclass, more similar to white-black tensions in the US.&lt;ref name="Lucassen 2005"/&gt; Algerian migration to France has generated nativism, characterized by the prominence of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] and his [[National Front (France)|National Front]].&lt;ref name="Lucassen 2005"/&gt;

===Pakistan===
{{further information|Sindhudesh}}
The Pakistani [[Administrative units of Pakistan|province]] of [[Sindh]] has seen nativist movements, promoting control for the [[Sindhi people]] over their homeland. After the 1947 [[Partition of India]], large numbers of [[Muhajir people]] migrating from India entered the province, becoming a majority in the provincial capital city of [[Karachi]], which formerly had an ethnically Sindhi majority. Sindhis have also voiced opposition to the promotion of [[Urdu]], as opposed to their native tongue, [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]].

These nativist movements are expressed through [[Sindhi nationalism]] and the [[Sindhudesh]] separatist movement. Nativist and nationalist sentiments increased greatly after the [[Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence|independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan]] in 1971.

===Taiwan===
Nativism flourished in [[Taiwan]] in the 1970s as a reaction against the influx of [[Mainland Chinese|mainland]] [[Chinese people|Chinese]] to the island after the [[Kuomintang]]'s defeat in 1949. Nativists felt that the political influence of mainland Chinese was disproportionately large. The term is especially found in the field of [[literature]], where nativist literature was more traditionally minded than the [[modernist literature]] written largely by mainland Chinese.

[[History of London|London was]] notorious for its xenophobia in the 16th century, and conditions worsened in the 1580s. Many immigrants became disillusioned by routine threats of violence and molestation, attempts at expulsion of foreigners, and the great difficulty in acquiring English citizenship. Dutch cities proved more hospitable, and many left London permanently.&lt;ref&gt;Bich Luu Lien, "Taking the Bread Out of Our Mouths": Xenophobia in Early Modern London," ''Immigrants and Minorities,'' July 2000, Vol. 19 Issue 2, pp. 1–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the Irish in 20th-century Great Britain, Lucassen&lt;ref name="Lucassen 2005"/&gt; argues that the deep religious divide between the Protestants and Catholics was at the core of the ongoing estrangement of the Irish in British society.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===United States===
====Early Republic====
Nativism was a political factor in the 1790s and in the 1830s-1850s. There was little nativism in the colonial era, but for a while [[Benjamin Franklin]] was hostile to [[German Americans]] in [[Province of Pennsylvania|colonial Pennsylvania]]; He called them "Palatine Boors." However, he reversed himself and became a supporter.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Frantz, "Franklin and the Pennsylvania Germans," ''Pennsylvania History'', [http://dpubs.libraries.psu.edu/DPubS?service=Repository&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Disseminate&amp;view=body&amp;content-type=pdf_1&amp;handle=psu.ph/1141422413# 65#1 (1998), 21–34 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nativism became a major issue in the late 1790s, when the Federalist Party expressed its strong opposition to the French Revolution by trying to strictly limit immigration, and stretching the time to 14 years for citizenship. At the time of the [[Quasi-War]] with France in 1798, the Federalists and Congress passed the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], including the Alien Act, the Naturalization Act and the Sedition Act. The movement was led by [[Alexander Hamilton]], despite his own status as an immigrant from a small Island. Phillip Magness argues that “Hamilton’s political career might legitimately be characterized as a sustained drift into nationalistic xenophobia.”&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Magness, "Alexander Hamilton as Immigrant Musical Mythology Meets Federalist Reality", [http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_21_4_03_magness.pdf ''The Independent Review'' 21#4 (2017) pp 497-508, quote on p 500.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]] fought by drafting the [[Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]]. The two laws against aliens were motivated by fears of a growing Irish radical presence in Philadelphia, where they supported Jefferson.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas M. Bradburn, "'True Americans' and 'Hordes of Foreigners': Nationalism, Ethnicity and the Problem of Citizenship in the United States, 1789-1800." ''Historical Reflections/Réflexions Historiques'' (2003): 19-41. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41299258 online]&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were not actually enforced.&lt;ref&gt;James Morton Smith,"The Enforcement of the Alien Friends Act of 1798." ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 41.1 (1954): 85-104. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1898151 online]&lt;/ref&gt; President John Adams annoyed his fellow Federalists by making peace with France, and splitting his party in 1800. Jefferson was elected president, and reversed most of the hostile legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Bradburn, "A clamor in the public mind: Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts." ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 65.3 (2008): 565-600. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25096814 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====1830-1860====
The term "nativism" was first used by 1844: "Thousands were Naturalized expressly to oppose Nativism, and voted the Polk ticket mainly to that end."&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (under "Nativism"), citing ''Whig Almanac'' 1845 4/2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nativism gained its name from the "Native American" parties of the 1840s and 1850s. In this context "Native" does not mean [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Americans]] or [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] but rather those descended from the inhabitants of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]]. It impacted politics in the mid-19th century because of the large inflows of immigrants after 1845 from cultures that were different from the existing American culture. Nativists objected primarily to [[Irish Catholic|Irish Roman Catholics]] because of their loyalty to the [[Pope]] and also because of their supposed rejection of [[republicanism]] as an American ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Ray A. Billington, ''The Protestant Crusade, 1800–1860: A Study of the Origins of American Nativism'' (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nativist movements included the [[Know Nothing|Know Nothing or American Party]] of the 1850s, the [[Immigration Restriction League]] of the 1890s, the anti-Asian movements in the [[Western United States|West]], resulting in the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]] and the "[[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]]" by which [[Japan]]'s government stopped [[emigration]] to the United States. [[Labor unions in the United States|Labor unions]] were strong supporters of Chinese exclusion and limits on immigration, because of fears that they would lower wages and make it harder for workers to organize unions.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the politics of the 1850s'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Eric Kaufmann has suggested that American nativism has been explained primarily in psychological and economic terms due to the neglect of a crucial cultural and ethnic dimension. Furthermore, Kauffman claims that American nativism cannot be understood without reference to an [[American ethnicity|American ethnic group]] which took shape prior to the large-scale immigration of the mid-eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/58583488/Kaufmann-EP-American-Exceptionalism-Reconsidered-Anglo-Saxon-Ethnogenesis-in-the-Universal-Nation-1776-1850-Journal-of-American-Studies-33|title=Kaufmann, EP, 'American Exceptionalism Reconsidered: Anglo-Saxon Ethnogenesis in the "Universal" Nation, 1776–1850,' Journal of American Studies, 33 (1999), 3, pp. 437–57|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:poperob.jpg|thumb|''[[Guardians of Liberty]]'', 1943, by Bishop [[Alma White]]]]
Nativist outbursts occurred in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] from the 1830s to the 1850s, primarily in response to a surge of Irish Catholic immigration. In 1836, [[Samuel Morse]] ran unsuccessfully for [[Mayor of New York City]] on a Nativist ticket, receiving 1,496 votes. In [[New York City]], an Order of United Americans was founded as a nativist fraternity, following the [[Philadelphia Nativist Riots]] of the preceding spring and summer, in December, 1844.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Billington, ''The Protestant Crusade, 1800–1860''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nativists went public in 1854 when they formed the 'American Party', which was especially hostile to the immigration of Irish Catholics and campaigned for laws to require longer wait time between immigration and naturalization. (The laws never passed.) It was at this time that the term "nativist" first appears, opponents denounced them as "bigoted nativists." Former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Millard Fillmore]] ran on the American Party ticket for the Presidency in 1856. The American Party also included many ex-Whigs who ignored nativism, and included (in the South) a few Catholics whose families had long lived in America. Conversely, much of the opposition to Catholics came from Protestant Irish immigrants and German Lutheran immigrants who were not native at all and can hardly be called "nativists."&lt;ref&gt;Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the politics of the 1850s''&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of [[nationalism]] is often identified with [[xenophobia]] and [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] sentiment (anti-Papism). In [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], a nativist mob [[Ursuline Convent Riots|attacked and burned down]] a Catholic convent in 1834 (no one was injured). In the 1840s, small scale riots between Catholics and nativists took place in several American cities. In Philadelphia in 1844, for example, a series of nativist assaults on Catholic churches and community centers resulted in the loss of lives and the professionalization of the police force. In [[Louisville, Kentucky]], election-day rioters killed at least 22 people in attacks on German and Irish Catholics on Aug. 6, 1855, in what became known as "[[Bloody Monday]]."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Peter. "Recalling Bloody Monday; Events to mark 1855 anti-immigrant riots in city," The Courier-Journal, Louisville, Ky. (July 30, 2005); Crews, Clyde: ''An American Holy Land: A History of the Archdiocese of Louisville'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Republican Party kept its nativist element quiet during the 1860s, since immigrants were urgently needed for the Union Army. Immigrants from England, Scotland and Scandinavia favored the Republicans during the [[Third Party System]], 1854-1896, while others were usually Democratic. Hostility toward Asians was very strong from the 1860s to the 1940s. Nativism experienced a revival in the 1890s, led by Protestant Irish immigrants hostile to Catholic immigration, especially the [[American Protective Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Kinzer, ''Episode in Anti-Catholicism: The American Protective Association'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-German nativism====
From the 1840s to 1920 [[German Americans]] were distrusted because of their separatist social structure, their German-language schools, their attachment to their native tongue over English, and their neutrality during [[World War I]].

The [[Bennett Law]] caused a political uproar in [[Wisconsin]] in 1890, as the state government passed a law that threatened to close down hundreds of German-language elementary schools. Catholic and Lutheran Germans rallied to defeat Governor [[William D. Hoard]]. Hoard attacked German American culture and religion:
:"We must fight alienism and selfish ecclesiasticism.... The parents, the pastors and the church have entered into a conspiracy to darken the understanding of the children, who are denied by cupidity and bigotry the privilege of even the free schools of the state."&lt;ref name="content.wisconsinhistory.org"&gt;Quoted on p. 388 of William Foote Whyte, [http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/u/?/wmh,5642 "The Bennett Law Campaign in Wisconsin,"] ''Wisconsin Magazine Of History'', 10: 4 (1926–1927), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;
Hoard, a Republican, was defeated by the Democrats. A similar campaign in Illinois regarding the "Edwards Law" led to a Republican defeat there in 1890.&lt;ref name="content.wisconsinhistory.org"/&gt;

In 1917–1918, a wave of nativist sentiment led to the suppression of German cultural activities in the United States, Canada and Australia. There was little violence, but many places and streets had their names changed (The city of "Berlin" in Ontario was renamed "Kitchener" after a British hero), churches switched to English for their services, and German Americans were forced to buy war bonds to show their patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick C. Luebke, ''Bonds of Loyalty: German-Americans and World War I'' (1974); Terrence G. Wiley, "The Imposition of World War I Era English-Only Policies and the Fate of German in North America," in Barbara Burnaby and Thomas K. Ricento, eds. ''Language and Politics in the United States and Canada: Myths and Realities'' (1998); Russell A. Kazal, ''Becoming Old Stock: The Paradox of German-American Identity'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia thousands of Germans were put into internment camps.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Macintyre, ''The Oxford History of Australia: vol. 4, The Succeeding Age, 1901–1942'' (1993), pp. 153–55; Jurgen Tampke, ''The Germans in Australia'' (2007) pp. 120–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-Chinese nativism====
In the 1870s in the [[Western United States|western states]] [[Irish Americans]] targeted violence against Chinese workers, driving them out of smaller towns. [[Denis Kearney]], an immigrant from Ireland, led a mass movement in [[San Francisco]] in the 1870s that incited attacks on the Chinese there and threatened public officials and railroad owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Soennichsen|title=The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LGL6_Z75y2gC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=51–57|isbn=9780313379475}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]] was the first of many nativist acts of Congress which attempted to limit the flow of immigrants into the U.S.. The Chinese responded to it by filing false claims of American birth, enabling thousands of them to immigrate to California.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Lee, ''At America's Gates: Chinese Immigration during the Exclusion Era, 1882–1943'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusion of the Chinese caused the western railroads to begin importing Mexican railroad workers in greater numbers ("[[traquero]]s").&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Marcos Garcilazo, ''`Traqueros': Mexican Railroad Workers in the United States, 1870 to 1930.''

&lt;/ref&gt;

====20th century====
In the 1890s–1920s era nativists and labor unions campaigned for immigration restriction. A favorite plan was the [[literacy test]] to exclude workers who could not read or write their own foreign language. Congress passed literacy tests, but presidents—responding to business needs for workers—vetoed them.&lt;ref name="Pula 1980 5–31"&gt;{{cite journal|title=American Immigration Policy and the Dillingham Commission|last=Pula|first=James|journal=Polish American Studies|date=Spring 1980|volume=37|issue=1|pages=5–31|jstor=20148034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] argued need for literacy tests and its implication on the new immigrants:
:It is found, in the first place, that the illiteracy test will bear most heavily upon the Italians, Russians, Poles, Hungarians, Greeks, and Asiatics, and lightly, or not at all, upon English-speaking emigrants, or Germans, Scandinavians, and French. In other words, the races most affected by the illiteracy test are those whose emigration to this country has begun within the last twenty years and swelled rapidly to enormous proportions, races with which the English speaking people have never hitherto assimilated, and who are most alien to the great body of the people of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lodge|first=Henry Cabot|title=The Restriction Immigration|url=http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/pdocs/lodge_immigration.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison|accessdate=3 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306093754/http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/pdocs/lodge_immigration.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to these demands, opponents of the literacy test called for the establishment of an immigration commission to focus on immigration as a whole. The United States Immigration Commission, also known as the [[Dillingham Commission]], was created and tasked with studying immigration and its effect on the United States. The findings of the commission further influenced immigration policy and upheld the concerns of the nativist movement.&lt;ref name="Pula 1980 5–31"/&gt;

Following [[World War I]], nativists in the twenties focused their attention on Catholics, Jews, and south-eastern Europeans and realigned their beliefs behind racial and religious nativism.&lt;ref name="Higham 1963 324"&gt;{{cite book|last=Higham|first=John|title=Strangers in the Land|year=1963|publisher=Atheneum|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The racial concern of the anti-immigration movement was linked closely to the eugenics movement that was sweeping the United States in the twenties. Led by Madison Grant's book, ''The Passing of the Great Race'' nativists grew more concerned with the racial purity of the United States. In his book, Grant argued that the American racial stock was being diluted by the influx of new immigrants from the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and the ghettos. ''The Passing of the Great Race'' reached wide popularity among Americans and influenced immigration policy in the twenties.&lt;ref name="Pula 1980 5–31"/&gt;
In the 1920s a wide national consensus sharply restricted the overall inflow of immigrants, especially those from southern and eastern Europe. The second [[Ku Klux Klan]], which flourished in the U.S. in the 1920s, used strong nativist rhetoric, but the Catholics led a counterattack.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Tucker, ''Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

After intense lobbying from the nativist movement the United States Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]] in 1921. This bill was the first to place numerical quotas on immigration. It capped the inflow of immigrations to 357,803 for those arriving outside of the western hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Pula 1980 5–31"/&gt; However, this bill was only temporary as Congress began debating a more permanent bill.

The Emergency Quota Act was followed with the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], a more permanent resolution. This law reduced the number of immigrants able to arrive from 357,803, the number established in the Emergency Quota Act, to 164,687.&lt;ref name="Pula 1980 5–31"/&gt; Though this bill did not fully restrict immigration, it considerably curbed the flow of immigration into the United States, especially from Southern and Eastern Europe. During the late twenties an average of 270,000 immigrants were allowed to arrive mainly because of the exemption of Canada and Latin American countries.&lt;ref name="Higham 1963 324"/&gt;

Fear of low-skilled immigrants flooding the labor market was an issue in the 1920s (focused on immigrants from [[Italy]] and [[Poland]]), and in the first decade of the 21st century (focused on immigrants from Mexico and Central America).

An [[immigration reduction]]ism movement formed in the 1970s and continues to the present day. Prominent members often press for massive, sometimes total, reductions in immigration levels.

American nativist sentiment experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century, this time directed at [[illegal immigration|undocumented workers]], largely [[Mexico|Mexican]] resulting in the passage of new penalties against illegal immigration in 1996.

Most immigration reductionists see [[Illegal immigration]], principally from across the [[United States–Mexico border]], as the more pressing concern. Authors such as [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] have also seen recent Hispanic immigration as creating a national identity crisis and presenting insurmountable problems for US social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting the large-scale Mexican immigration in the Southwest, the Cold-war diplomat [[George F. Kennan]] in 2002 saw "unmistakable evidences of a growing differentiation between the cultures, respectively, of large southern and southwestern regions of this country, on the one hand", and those of "some northern regions". In the former, he warned:
:the very culture of the bulk of the population of these regions will tend to be primarily Latin-American in nature rather than what is inherited from earlier American traditions&amp;nbsp;... Could it really be that there was so little of merit [in America] that it deserves to be recklessly trashed in favor of a polyglot mix-mash?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Kauffman]], [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/dec/19/00016/ Free Vermont], ''[[The American Conservative]]'' December 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayers argues that Kennan represented the "tradition of militant nativism" that resembled or even exceeded the Know Nothings of the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;David Mayers, ''George Kennan and the Dilemmas of US Foreign Policy'' (1990) ch 3&lt;/ref&gt; Mayers adds that Kennan also believed American women had too much power.

====21st century====
By late 2014, the "[[Tea Party movement]]" had turned its focus away from economic issues, spending, and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]], and towards President [[Barack Obama]]'s immigration policies, which it saw as threatening to transform American society. It planned to defeat leading Republicans who supported immigration programs, such as Senator [[John McCain]].  A typical slogan appeared in the ''Tea Party Tribune'': “Amnesty for Millions, Tyranny for All.” The ''New York Times'' reported:
:What started five years ago as a groundswell of conservatives committed to curtailing the reach of the federal government, cutting the deficit and countering the Wall Street wing of the Republican Party has become a movement largely against immigration overhaul. The politicians, intellectual leaders and activists who consider themselves part of the Tea Party have redirected their energy from fiscal austerity and small government to stopping any changes that would legitimize people who are here illegally, either through granting them citizenship or legal status.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy W. Peters, "Obama’s Immigration Action Reinvigorates Tea Party," [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/us/obamas-immigration-action-reinvigorates-tea-party.html ''New York Times'' Nov 25, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2016 bid for presidency, Republican Presidential Candidate [[Donald Trump]] has been accused of introducing nativist themes for his controversial stances on temporarily banning foreign Muslims from entering the United States and erecting a [[Trump's border wall|substantial wall]] between the [[US-Mexico border]] to halt [[illegal immigration]]. [[John Cassidy (journalist)|Journalist John Cassidy]] wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' Trump is transforming the GOP into a populist, nativist party:
:Trump has been drawing on a base of alienated white working-class and middle-class voters, seeking to remake the G.O.P. into a more populist, nativist, avowedly protectionist, and semi-isolationist party that is skeptical of immigration, free trade, and military interventionism.&lt;ref&gt;John Cassidy , "Donald Trump Is Transforming the G.O.P. into a Populist, Nativist Party. [http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/donald-trump-is-transforming-the-g-o-p-into-a-populist-nativist-party ''The New Yorker'' Feb. 29, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Brand, a professor of political science, argues:
:Donald Trump’s nativism is a fundamental corruption of the founding principles of the Republican Party. Nativists champion the purported interests of American citizens over those of immigrants, justifying their hostility to immigrants by the use of derogatory stereotypes: Mexicans are rapists; Muslims are terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Brand, "How Donald Trump’s Nativism Ruined the GOP" [http://fortune.com/2016/06/21/donald-trump-nativism-gop/ ''Fortune'' June 21, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Proclamation of William III.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of King [[William III of the Netherlands]] regarding his accession, 1849]]
[[File:RoyalProclamation 1715 ForArrestOf SirWilliamWyndham 3rdBaronet.JPG|thumb|200px|Handbill publishing the Royal Proclamation of King George I, dated 23 September 1715, for the "discovery and apprehension" of [[Sir William Wyndham, 3rd Baronet]], the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] leader]] 

A '''proclamation''' (Lat. ''proclamare'', to make public by announcement) is an official declaration issued by a person of authority to make certain announcements known. Proclamations are currently used within the governing framework of some nations and are usually issued in the name of the [[head of state]]. 

==United Kingdom==
In [[English law]], a proclamation is a formal announcement ("'''royal proclamation'''"), made under the [[great Seal of the Realm|great seal]], of some matter which the [[Queen-in-Council|King in Council]] or [[Queen-in-Council|
Queen in Council]] desires to make known to his or her subjects: ''e.g.'', the [[declaration of war]], or [[state of emergency]], the statement of [[Neutral country|neutrality]], the summoning or dissolution of [[British parliament|Parliament]], or the bringing into operation of the provisions of some statute the enforcement of which the legislature has left to the discretion of the king or queen&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Proclamation |volume=22 |page=417 |first=Alexander Wood |last=Renton |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the announcement. Proclamations are also used for declaring [[bank holiday]]s and the issuance of coinage.

Royal proclamations of this character, made in furtherance of the executive power of [[the Crown]], are binding on the subject, "where they do not either contradict the old laws or tend to establish new ones, but only confine the execution of such laws as are already in being in such matter as the sovereign shall judge necessary" (Blackstone's Commentaries, ed. Stephen, ii. 528; Stephen's Commentaries, 14th ed. 1903, ii. 506, 507; Dicey, Law of the Constitution, 6th ed., 51). Royal proclamations, which, although not made in pursuance of the executive powers of the Crown, either call upon the subject to fulfil some duty which they are by law bound to perform, or to abstain from any acts or conduct already prohibited by law, are lawful and right, and disobedience to them (while not of itself a misdemeanour) is an aggravation of the offence (see charge of Chief Justice Cockburn to the grand jury in R. v. Eyre (1867) and [[Case of Proclamations]] 1610, 12 Co. Rep. 74.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1610/J22.html England and Wales High Court (King's Bench Division) Decisions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown has from time to time legislated by proclamation; and the [[Statute of Proclamations 1539]] provided that proclamations made by the king with the assent of the council should have the force of statute law if they were not prejudicial to "any person's inheritance, offices, liberties, goods, chattels or life." But this enactment was repealed by an act of 1547; and it is certain that a proclamation purporting to be made in the exercise of legislative power by which the sovereign imposes a duty to which the subject is not by law liable, or prohibits under penalties what is not an offence at law, or adds fresh penalties to any offence, is of no effect unless itself issued in virtue of statutory authority (see also [[Order in Council]]).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The Crown has power to legislate by proclamation for a newly conquered country (Jenkyns, ''British Rule and Jurisdiction beyond the Seas''); and this power was freely exercised in [[North America]] following the [[Seven Years' War]] by the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] and in the [[Transvaal Colony]] during the [[Second Boer War]] 1899–1902. In the British colonies, ordinances are frequently brought into force by proclamation; certain imperial acts do not take effect in a colony until they are proclaimed (e.g. the [[Foreign Enlistment Act 1870]]); and proclamations are constantly issued in furtherance of executive acts. In many British protectorates the high commissioner or administrator was empowered to legislate by proclamation.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the old system of real property law in England, fines, levied with "proclamations", ''i.e.'', with successive public announcements of the transaction in open court, barred the rights of strangers, as well as parties, in case they had not made claim to the property conveyed within five years thereafter (acts 1483–1484 and 1488–1489). These proclamations were originally made sixteen times, four times in the term in which the fine was levied, and four times in each of the three succeeding terms. Afterwards the number of proclamations was reduced to one in each of the four terms. The proclamations were endorsed on the back of the record. The system was abolished by the [[Fines and Recoveries Act 1833]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

On certain rare occasions, the [[herald]]s of the [[College of Arms]] and the [[Lyon Court]] (or somebody else assigned to) still publicly read out certain proclamations such as the proclamation regarding the dissolution of parliament or proclamations regarding the [[Coronation of the British monarch|monarch's coronation]], where they are read at the steps of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] in London and at the [[Mercat Cross, Edinburgh|Mercat Cross]] in Edinburgh.

'''Remittance advice''' is a letter sent by a customer to a supplier to inform the supplier that their [[invoice]] has been paid. If the customer is paying by [[cheque]], the remittance advice often accompanies the cheque. The advice may consist of a literal letter (e.g., "Gentlemen: Your shipment of the 10th inst was received in good order; accompanying is our remittance of $52.47 per invoice No 83046") or of a [[Voucher#Account voucher|voucher]] attached to the side or top of the cheque.

Remittance advices are not mandatory, however they are seen as a courtesy because they help the [[Accounts receivable|accounts-receivable department]] to match invoices with payments.  The remittance advice should therefore specify the invoice numbers for which payment is tendered. 

In countries where cheques are still used, most companies' invoices are designed so that customers return a portion of the invoice, called a remittance advice, with their payment. In countries where [[wire transfer]] is the predominant payment method, invoices are commonly accompanied by standardised bank transfer order forms (like ''[[:nl:acceptgiro|acceptgiro]]s'' {{nl icon}} (Netherlands) and ''[[:de:Überweisung (Zahlungsverkehr)|Überweisung]]en'' {{de icon}} (German)) which include a field into which the invoice or client number can be encoded, usually in a computer-readable way. The payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at, or mails it to, his bank, which will then transfer the money.

The employee who opens the incoming mail should initially compare the amount of cash received with the amount shown on the remittance advice. If the customer does not return a remittance advice, an employee prepares one. Like the [[cash register]] tape, the remittance advice serves as a record of cash initially received.

Modern systems will often scan a paper remittance advice into a computer system where [[data acquisition|data entry]] will be performed. Modern remittance advises can include dozens, or hundreds of invoice numbers, and other information.

Remittance advises (RAs) can be very complicated, especially in specialized fields like medical insurance payments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6398">The '''Rospigliosi Music Collection''' is a collection of musical documents preserved in two institutions in [[Pistoia]], Italy: the Archive of the Chapter and the Forteguerriana Library.

==History==
The collection was, for the most part, collected and organized by [[Rospigliosi family|Giovan Carlo Rospigliosi]] (1823-1908), a descendent of the family tree of [[Pope Clement IX]] (Giulio Rospigliosi, 1600-1669).&lt;ref name="CATALOGO"&gt;Teresa Dolfi, Luciano Vannucci (ed.), ''Catalogo del Fondo Musicale Rospigliosi'', Lucca, LIM, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SITO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forteguerriana.comune.pistoia.it/fondi-musicali/|title=Page of the collection|publisher=Official website of Forteguerriana Library}} (it)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FORTE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=10&amp;val_search=|title=Page of the Collection in Forteguerriana|publisher=CeDoMus}} (it)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAPITOLO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedomus.toscana.it/web-db/?idscheda=11&amp;val_search=|title=Page of the collection in the Archive of the Chapter|publisher=CeDoMus}} (it)&lt;/ref&gt; He dabbled in voice (a baritone), and following the cultural tendencies of the high-bourgeois of the nineteenth century to furnish private libraries with music to be played in their private salons,&lt;ref&gt;A popular tendency of which Carl Dahlhaus also speaks about, see ''La musica dell'Ottocento'', Scandicci (FI), La Nuova Italia, 1990, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; he acquired and commissioned various musical pieces (above all songs) to animate the ordinary evenings in his palaces (that of via Ripa del Sale in [[Pistoia|Pistoia,]] and the villas of Candeglia in Spicchio and in [[Gello]]).&lt;ref name="CATALOGO" /&gt;
[[File:Pagina manoscritta di una sonata a due violini di Niccolò Jommelli.png|thumb|500x700px|Handwritten page of a sonata for two violins by [[Niccolò Jommelli]] preserved in the Rospigliosi Music Collection in the Archive of the Chapter.&lt;ref&gt;The sonata is entirely digitalized on the [http://www.archiviocapitolaredipistoia.it/nicol_jommelli_sonata_a_due_violini_pt_ac_bibliotheca_musicalis_b2454-idm342.php official website of the Archive of the Chapter] (it)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
He also collected numerous librettos, single arias and complete works for voice and pianoforte, drawn from the performances of the Teatro dei Risvegliati, to which he was a member.&lt;ref name="CATALOGO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FORTE" /&gt; His musical possessions were greatly amplified when he integrated his immense patrimony of his family, who became one of the most extravagant patrons of Pistoia from 1635 and on.&lt;ref name="CATALOGO" /&gt; The remarkable collection, kept organized&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Rafanelli, ''Il Palazzo di Ripa del Sale in una descrizione del 1832'', Pistoia, Settegiorni, 2011, pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt; (three accurate inventories composed by Giovan Carlo exist),&lt;ref&gt;Ornella Zini, ''Il fondo musicale Rospigliosi'', in «Le opere e i giorni», III/4 (luglio-dicembre 2000), Pistoia, Diocesi di Pistoia, 2000, pp. 126-137.&lt;/ref&gt; remained the property of the descendents of the Rospigliosi family until the 1970s when the priest from Pistoia, Umberto Pineschi, convinced Clemente Rospigliosi to donate the most antique pages to the Archive of the Chapter. The same Clemente, in 1982, decided to donate the rest of the collection to the Town of Pistoia, where it is preserved still today in the Forteguerriana Library.&lt;ref name="CATALOGO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FORTE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CAPITOLO" /&gt;

==Description==
In all, the collection consists of 4668 units: 4116 are at the Forteguerriana, 552 are at the Archive of the Chapter.&lt;ref name="CATALOGO" /&gt; The oldest objects, manuscripts, come about because of the patronage of the Rospilgliosi Family, with a great deal of music by the composers that were active in Pistoia, Pisa and Florence in the 1700s (for example [[Giovan Gualberto Brunetti]], [[Charles-Antoine Campion]], [[Giuseppe Gherardeschi]], [[Christian Joseph Lidarti]]) as well as at the national level (such as [[Giovanni Battista Sammartini]], Niccolò Jommelli and [[Giuseppe Farinelli]]). Most of these are conserved today in the Archive of the Chapter because of their sacred nature.&lt;ref name="CAPITOLO" /&gt;
The Forteguerriana Library, however, hosts the manuscript of ''Ercole in Tebe'' by [[Jacopo Melani]] in 1661 of theatrical origin.&lt;ref name="FORTE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SITO" /&gt; The core of the collection is based on the acquisitions in the 1800s by Giovan Carlo, and is made up of: some arias composed for him by the local songwriter Raffaello Bertini (of which the Forteguerriana Library conserves the handwritten copies),&lt;ref name="CATALOGO" /&gt; numerous opera librettos (of almost all of the authors found in Pistoia from 1868 to 1902, from [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]] to [[Teodulo Mabellini|Mabellini]], from [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]] to [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]], from [[Giovanni Pacini|Pacini]] to [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], from [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] to [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], from [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] to [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], from [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] to [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], to whom he shares a strong spirit for the Risorgimento),&lt;ref name="CATALOGO" /&gt; printed editions of arias for voice (suitable for his own range of baritone, but also for other voice types) inspired by miscellaneous and contemporary collections and often with piano accompaniment (librettos and songs are at the Forteguerriana),&lt;ref name="FORTE" /&gt; publications regarding musical topics (today at the Archive of the Chapter), such as publications by the theorists of the 1800s and 1900s (Abramo Basevi, Riccardo Gandolfi) as well as letters and other writings by composers (for example letters by Bellini in an edition dated 1882, and the artistic memories of Pacini printed from 1865 to 1872).&lt;ref name="CAPITOLO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FORTE" /&gt;

"'''Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], tale number 188.

It is [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 585.

==Synopsis==

A girl's parents having died, was raised by her godmother, who died, leaving her the house and a spindle, a shuttle, and a needle to earn her living.  She did quite well at it.

One day, a king's son came looking for a bride.  He wanted one who was at once the richest and the poorest.  In this village, they pointed out the richest girl, and then the orphan girl.  He rode by the richest girl, who bowed to him, and he rode on.  He rode by the poorest girl, who was spinning.  When she saw he was looking at her, she blushed and closed her eyes.  He rode by, and she opened the window, saying it was hot, but watching until he left.

Then she remembered rhymes her godmother had used.  She set the spindle to guide the prince back by its golden thread, the shuttle to weave a path to her hut, and the needle to adorn the hut.  When the prince returned, he said she was both the richest and the poorest, and married her.  The spindle, shuttle, and needle were kept in the royal treasury.

"'''The Three Aunts'''" is a Norwegian [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]] in ''[[Norske Folkeeventyr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George Webbe Dasent, ''Popular Tales from the Norse'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/asbjornsenmoe/threeaunts.html "The Three Aunts"]  Edinburgh: David Douglass, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A poor man made his living by shooting.  He had lost his wife, and one day, his pretty daughter decided to go seek her fortune.  She got a place with the queen, and worked so hard that she became a favorite.  The other women, jealous, told the queen that she had claimed to be able to spin a pound of flax in twenty-four hours.  The queen set her to do it.  She begged a room for herself but never having spun flax, could not do it.  An old woman came to her, got the story from her, and on the promise that the girl would call her "Aunt" on her wedding day, did the spinning for her.

The queen was pleased with it, making the other women more jealous.  They said the girl had said she could weave it all in twenty-four hours, and the queen set her to the task again.  Another old woman wove it for it, for the same price.  Then the women claimed she could sew it all into shirts in twenty-four hours, and a third old woman sewed them for the same price.

The queen decided to marry her to the prince, because such a worker would never need to hire working women.  The women came. The first was a hag with a nose three ells long, the second had a humped back, the third eyes like saucers, but the bride greeted them as "Aunt" and the prince had to seat them at the high table.  He asked why they were so hideous.  The first blamed her nose on her spinning, and the second her back on her weaving, and the third her eyes on her sewing.  The prince said that his bride would no longer spin, weave, or sew.

F.'' [http://www.encspb.ru/en/article.php?kod=2804017249 Ves Peterburg (Entire St. Petersburg)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The full name of the edition is {{lang-ru|Весь Петербург/Петроград/Ленинград. Адресная и справочная книга г. Петербурга/Петрограда/Ленинграда}} where the subtitle clarifies and discloses that this directory contains addresses and the other reference information for the city. Actually this huge volume which grew up to 1800-1900 pages has always provided more, including surveys on the city economy, extracts from the legislative acts, lists of the post offices through the entire Russia, if not to mention thousands of commercial advertisings.

A point of special interest was the historic and statistical city digest in V. I. Pokrovsky's feature article, published in the Ves Peterburg in 1901 and 1903)&lt;ref name="Vexler" /&gt;. 

From 1910-ths the editors of the directory aimed at the gradual expansion of the territorial coverage of their edition. Starting with the closest suburbs, by 1917 they included the information and maps related to the largest cities of the Petrograd gubernia. After the soviets resumed the publication of the city directory, they continued this expansion, covering more and more cities of the [[Leningrad oblast]], up to [[Luga, Leningrad Oblast|Luga]] and [[Gdov]].

== Structure ==
=== Governmental institutions ===
Until 1917, while the city was the capital of the Russian empire, 'Ves Petrograd' provided its readers with the comprehensive information upon the ministries and the councils, the royal establishments and the State Duma. The movement of the capital of the Soviet Russia from Petrograd to Moscow in 1918 coinsided with the 4-year suspension of the directory (1918-1921).

Since 1922 when the city authorities of Petrograd resumed the publication of the directory, it continued the institutional section of the directory, now revealing the new structure of the municipal (soviets), party committees, professional unions and other social organizations.

=== Cultural, educational, religious and other non-commercial institutions===
In different periods the relevant information was either included in the first, 'governmental' section, or was concentrated in trhe separate section of the directory. It's noteworthy to mention, that since the very first editions of the Soviet period, 'Ves Leningrad' has been publishing the list of cathedrals and churches, which were taken under the state protection, as the cultural monuments. From 1920-ies the directories contain a lot information on people education, which help historians to trace its development from the [[likbez]] schools for illiterate to many hundreds of schools and tens of universities opened by the end of the First Five-year plan (1927-1932) and later.

=== Commercial institutions, industry and finance ===
The entries of this section are usually repeated in two subsections, alphabetic by name and by the branch of industry. Alongside with thousands of separate commercial advertisings, it provides economic historians with the valuable source of raw data. Beyond that, the directory published the special surveys on the city economy, including the turnover of the international trade, where Leningrad played the main role, as the largest port in the USSR.

Those who imagine the Leningrad as the core of the strict government-run economy shall be surprised to see tens, if not hundreds of small collectively owned guilds (artel {{lang-ru|артели}}) and cooperatives which continued to function in Leningrad many years after the NEP (the 'new economic policy') was suspended in favour of the 5-year planning.

=== Doctors, lawyers, etc. ===
The personal lists of practitioners in medicine and advocacy are the characteristic feature of the epoch before second world war. One should not be surprised to find hundreds of private lawyers, dentists and even obstetricians in Petrograd and Leningrad, for the soviet economy has never been totally government-run.

=== Streets and lists of residents ===
This is a very important section for the directory of the city like Leningrad, counting 2-3 million residents. The special section of the directory not only lists all the streets in alphabetic order, but also informs, what house numbers are on the odd and even sides between the crossing streets. If necessary, special maps are provided for the longest streets and prospects. Alongside with the house numbers the directory informs about the jurisdiction of the relevant city blocks, the closest post offices etc.

Amateur researchers often fall into error, mussing up the ownership of the real estates with the personal residential addresses, however the professional historians extract deeper information, differing between the owners and the managers. However, 70% and more of the pre-revolutionary residents of Petrograd, mainly industrial workers remained outside the directory, since they were economically forced to hire separate rooms, and even the corners of rooms, offered to them by the wholesale profiteers in hiring dwellings. Also, even in the middle class families only the heads of households were listed in the directory, while their spouses and minors were omitted.

Anyway, the curious scrollers may be excided to find online not only the addresses, but also the home telephone numbers of [[Matilda Kshesinskaya]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://vivaldi.nlr.ru/bx000020513/view#page=1115 Кшесинская Матильда Феликсовна]. — Весь Петербург, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; (#414), [[Aleksandr Kerensky]] (#11-960&lt;ref&gt;[https://vivaldi.nlr.ru/bx000020513/view#page=1050 Керенский Александр Фёдорович] — Весь Петербург, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;) on the pages of 'Ves Peterburg', as well as of [[Grigory Zinoviev]] (#127-61&lt;ref&gt;[https://vivaldi.nlr.ru/bx000020124/view#page=641 Зиновьев Григорий Евсеевич]. — Весь Ленинград, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;) on the pages of 'Ves Leningrad'.

=== Public transport ===
In 1970s Leningrad became the top-ranking city of the world by the length of city tram lines and the total number of tram routes. From the directory of 1908, after the first lines of tram were opened (September, 1907), the directory provided the detailed information on each of these routes, including the streets, the tram stops, the fares, and what is not less important, the specific combination of colored identification lights which were set for each tram route.

== Termination of series ==
The last directory of 'Ves Leningrad' was published in 1935&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlr.ru/cont/v_l/1935.php Весь Ленинград], 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the subsequent years the edition was replaced with abridged version (1939 and 1940) where all personal data (residency / domicile, phone numbers) was excluded.

== Other city directories ==

Suvorin also published city directories for [[Moscow]] under the title ''[[Vsia Moskva]]'' (All Moscow) for the years 1875 to 1936 and for the whole country under the titles ''[[Vsia Rossiia]]'' (All Russia) continued under than name ''[[Ves SSSR]]'' (All USSR) from 1924 to 1931.

Since 1993 the private publishing House Presskom launched the annual telephone directory project under the title 'Ves Petersburg', however it is radically and conceptually different from its historical predecessor, and does not list residents at all&lt;ref name="Vexler" /&gt;.

'''Wanderu''' is a ground travel search platform and [[Travel website#Fare aggregators and metasearch engines|fare aggregator]] that operates throughout [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. It partners with bus and train operators to provide a one-stop search and booking platform through its website and mobile app. Wanderu is headquartered in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The company was founded in 2012 by CEO Polina Raygorodskaya and COO Igor Bratnikov.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/wanderu|title=Wanderu &amp;#124; CrunchBase Profile|date=|publisher=Crunchbase.com|accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
Wanderu was founded in 2012 by Polina Raygorodskaya and Igor Bratnikov.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the time when the idea for Wanderu was conceived, Raygorodskaya and Bratnikov were part of [[GreenXC]], a nationwide campaign intended to raise awareness for national parks and forests throughout the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usda.gov/2011/07/07/us-forest-service-helps-young-adults-bring-awareness-to-national-forests-though-a-cross-country-adventure/|title=USDA Blog » US Forest Service Helps Young Adults Bring Awareness to National Forests Though a Cross-Country Adventure|date=|publisher=Blogs.usda.gov|author=Polina says:|accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aiming to promote sustainable forms of transportation, the group chose ride-shares as their main form of travel hitting a snag when one of their ride-shares cancelled and they had to find a bus to get to their next destination. Since no direct bus served the route, they had no way of finding which buses could get them where they needed to go or even find the closest station to where they were. Realizing the void in the market, they set out to build Wanderu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budgettravel.com/blog/about-to-enter-golden-age-ground-transportation,12604/|title=Is the Golden Age of Ground Transportation Near? &amp;#124; Budget Travel's Blog &amp;#124; Travel Deals, Travel Tips, Travel Advice, Vacation Ideas|last=Michonski|first=Laura|date=2012-11-07|publisher=Budgettravel.com|accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Wanderu launched a private beta version of Wanderu.

[[File:ThiseltonDyer.jpg|thumb|right]]'''Sir William Turner Thiselton-Dyer''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|KCMG|CIE|FRS|FLS}} (28 July 1843 – 23 December 1928) was a leading British [[botanist]], and the third director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]].

== Life and career ==
Thiselton-Dyer was born in [[Westminster]], London. He was a son of William George Thiselton-Dyer, physician and Catherine Jane, née Firminger, botanist. He was educated at [[King's College School]] where he was first mathematical scholar, and later proceeded to the medical department of [[King's College London]], where he remained until 1863 when he proceeded to [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. Initially studying [[mathematics]] at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], he graduated in [[natural science]] in 1867. He became Professor of Natural History at the [[Royal Agricultural College]] in [[Cirencester]] and then Professor of Botany at the [[Royal College of Science for Ireland]] in Dublin. In 1872, he became professor at the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] in London, being recommended by [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]].

Then in 1875, Thiselton-Dyer was appointed Assistant Director at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, under Hooker, where he was to stay for thirty years. Thiselton-Dyer spent considerable time working for the benefit of the British colonies. He introduced rubber plantations to [[Sri Lanka]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]], and introduced [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]] from [[Trinidad]] to plantations in Sri Lanka. In 1877, he was given charge of an international research laboratory, established at Kew with private funding, which became known as one of the best laboratories in Europe. Thiselton-Dyer also designed a new rock garden, after a bequest to Kew in 1881 of a large collection of Alpine plants.

Thiselton-Dyer was elected FRS in 1880. His proposers included [[Charles Darwin]] and [[George Bentham]], but not Joseph Dalton Hooker, whose daughter Dyer had already married. From 1885 to 1905, after the retirement of Hooker, he was director of the Royal Botanic Gardens.

Thiselton-Dyer was a fellow of the [[University of London]] from 1887 to 1890, [[Royal Commissioner]] to the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris International Exhibition]] (1900) and to the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis Exposition]] (1904), botanical adviser to the Secretary of State for the Colonies (1902–1906),&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=27435|page=3324| date=20 May 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a member of the court of the [[University of Bristol]] in 1909.  His principal works are an English edition of [[Julius Sachs|Sachs]] ''Text-Book of Botany'' (1875), editions of the ''Flora Capensis'' and of the ''Flora of Tropical Africa'', and ''[[Index Kewensis]]'' (1905).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

With his former school-friend [[Henry Trimen]] he published ''The Flora of Middlesex'' (1869).

He married the botanical illustrator [[Harriet Anne Hooker Thiselton-Dyer|Harriet Anne Hooker]], daughter of Joseph Dalton Hooker, in 1877;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/thiselton-dyer-william-turner|title=Thiselton-Dyer, William Turner|last=Geison|first=Gerald L.|website=''encyclopedia.com''|access-date=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; they had one son and one daughter. She lived at Kew from birth until old age, surviving her husband and dying in 1946 aged 91, in her house near [[Bere Alston]]. Thiselton-Dyer was appointed {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KCMG}} in 1899,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dyer, William Turner Thiselton-|journal=Who's Who|year=1919|pages=741|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015047639912;view=1up;seq=783}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded the [[Clarke Medal]] by the [[Royal Society of New South Wales]] in 1892. He died at The Ferns (now Crickley Court), Witcombe, a village near Gloucester, and is buried in the churchyard of St Peter's, Bentham.
