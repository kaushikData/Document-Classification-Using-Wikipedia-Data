The '''1973 oil crisis''' began in October 1973 when the members of the [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries]] proclaimed an oil [[embargo]]. The embargo was targeted at nations perceived as supporting Israel during the [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Charles D. (2006), Palestine and the Arab–Israeli Conflict, New York: Bedford, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial nations targeted were [[Canada]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] with the embargo also later extended to [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]].
By the end of the embargo in March 1974,&lt;ref name=USstate2ndCrisis&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/oil-embargo |title=OPEC Oil Embargo 1973–1974 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]], [[Office of the Historian]] |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[price of oil]] had risen from US$3 per [[barrel (unit)#Oil barrel|barrel]] to nearly $12 globally; US prices were significantly higher. The embargo caused an oil crisis, or "shock", with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt; It was later called the "first oil shock", followed by the [[1979 oil crisis]], termed the "second oil shock."

==Background==

===American production decline===
By 1969 American domestic output of oil could not keep pace with increasing demand; in 1925 oil had accounted for one-fifth of American energy use. By the time [[World War II]] started one-third of America's energy needs was met by oil. Oil started to replace [[coal]] as a preferred [[fuel]] source — it was used to heat homes and generate [[electricity]], and it was the only fuel that could be used for air transport. In 1920, American oilfields accounted for nearly two-thirds of global oil production. In 1945, US production had increased to just over two-thirds. The US had been able to meet its own energy needs independently in the decade between 1945 and 1955, but was importing 350 million barrels per year by the late 1950s, mostly from [[History of the Venezuelan oil industry|Venezuela]] and [[History of the petroleum industry in Canada|Canada]]. In 1973, US production had declined to 16.5% of global output.&lt;ref name=painter&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 39| issue = 4| last = David S. Painter| title = Oil and Geopolitics: The Oil Crises of the 1970s and the Cold War| journal = Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung| jstor = 24145533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=little&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Univ of North Carolina Press| isbn = 978-0-8078-7761-6| last = Little| first = Douglas| title = American Orientalism: The United States and the Middle East since 1945| chapter=2. Opening the Door: Business, Diplomacy, and America's Stake in Middle East Oil |date = 2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The costs of producing oil in the Middle East were low enough that companies could turn a profit despite the US tariff on oil imports. This hurt domestic oil producers in places like [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]] who had been selling oil at tariff-supported prices and now had to compete with cheap oil from the [[Persian Gulf]] region. The first American firms to take advantage of low production costs in the Middle East were [[Getty Oil|Getty]], [[Amoco|Standard Oil of Indiana]], [[Conoco|Continental Oil]] and [[ARCO|Atlantic Richfield]]. In 1959, Eisenhower said "As long as Middle Eastern oil continues to be as cheap as it is, there is probably little we can do to reduce the dependence of Western Europe on the Middle East." Eventually, at the behest of independent American producers, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] imposed [[Import quota|quota]]s on foreign oil that would stay in place between 1959 and 1973.&lt;ref name=little /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-275-94562-6| last = Pelletiere| first = Stephen C.| title = Iraq and the International Oil System: Why America Went to War in the Gulf| chapter=4. The OPEC Revolution and the Clashes Between Iraq and the Cartel | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQ1cpB65KR4C |date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics called it the [[Mandatory Oil Import Quota Program|"drain America first"]] policy. Some scholars believe the policy contributed to the [[peak oil|decline of domestic US oil production]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=price&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-02906-3| last = Price-Smith| first = Andrew T.| title = Oil, Illiberalism, and War: An Analysis of Energy and US Foreign Policy |chapter=1. The History of Oil in International Affairs | date = 2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While US oil production declined, domestic demand was increasing at the same time leading to [[inflation]] and a steadily rising [[consumer price index]] between 1964 and 1970.&lt;ref name=spr &gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Texas A&amp;M University Press| chapter=1.

US [[Excess supply|surplus]] production capacity had declined from 4 million bpd to around 1 million bpd between 1963 and 1970, increasing American dependence on foreign oil imports.&lt;ref name=spr /&gt; When [[Richard Nixon]] took office in 1969, he assigned [[George Shultz]] to head a committee to review the Eisenhower-era quota program — Shultz's committee recommended that the quotas be abolished and replaced with tariffs but Nixon decided to keep the quotas due to vigorous political opposition.&lt;ref name=yergin9&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Simon and Schuster| isbn = 978-1-4711-0475-6| last = Yergin| first = Daniel| title = The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money &amp; Power| chapter=29. The Oil Weapon | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6pGQvVqNAoC |date = 2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon imposed a [[price ceiling]] on oil in 1971 as demand for oil was increasing and production was declining, which increased dependence on foreign oil imports as consumption was bolstered by low prices.&lt;ref name=spr /&gt; In 1973 Nixon announced the end of the quota system. Between 1970 and 1973 US imports of crude oil had nearly doubled, reaching 6.2 million barrels per day in 1973. Until 1973, an abundance of oil supply had kept the market price of oil lower than the posted price.&lt;ref name=yergin9 /&gt;

===OPEC===
The [[OPEC|Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC), was founded by five oil producing countries at a [[Baghdad]] conference on September 14, 1960. The five founding members of OPEC were [[Venezuela]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iran]] and [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=rose&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=424–443 |last=Euclid A. Rose |title=OPEC's Dominance of the Global Oil Market: The Rise of the World's Dependency on Oil |journal=Middle East Journal |date=2004 |jstor=4330033}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPEC was organized after the oil companies slashed the [[posted price]] of oil, but the posted price of oil remained consistently higher than the market price of oil between 1961 and 1972.&lt;ref name=kuiken&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.3366/brw.2015.0165 |issn=2043-8567 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=5–26 |last=Kuiken |first=Jonathan |title=Striking the Balance: Intervention versus Non-intervention in Britain's Oil Policy, 1957–1970 |journal=Britain and the World |accessdate=2018-06-18 |date=2015-03-01 |url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/brw.2015.0165 |via=[[University of Edinburgh]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the [[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]] controlled 86% of the oil produced by OPEC countries, but by 1970 the rise of "independent oil companies" had decreased their share to 77%. The entry of three new oil producers—[[Algeria]], [[Libya]] and [[Nigeria]]—meant that by 1970 eighty-one oil companies were doing business in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-313-32459-8 |last=Alnasrawi |first=Abbas |title=Iraq's Burdens: Oil, Sanctions, and Underdevelopment |chapter=1.

In the early 1960s [[Libya]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Qatar]] joined OPEC. OPEC was generally regarded as ineffective until political turbulence in [[Libya]] and [[Iraq]] strengthened their position in 1970. Additionally, increasing [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence provided oil producing countries with alternative means of transporting oil to markets.&lt;ref name=peelo&gt;{{Cite journal |issn=0577-5132 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=49 |last=Peelo |first=Victor |title=Behind the U.S.-OPEC Conflict |journal=Challenge: The U.S. Economy in Action |accessdate=2018-06-20 |date=1975-10-09 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=6149590&amp;site=ehost-live |via=[[EBSCOhost]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Tehran Price Agreement of 1971]] the posted price of oil was increased and, due to a decline in the value of the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] relative to [[gold]], certain anti-inflationary measures were enacted.&lt;ref name=peelo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=501–511 |last1=David Hammes |last2=Douglas Wills |title=Black Gold: The End of Bretton Woods and the Oil-Price Shocks of the 1970s |journal=The Independent Review |date=2005 |jstor=24562081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion about the impact of inflation on the purchasing power of oil revenues in the 1970s ''see'' {{Cite journal |issn=0098-1818 |volume=98 |issue=11 |pages=36 |last1=Murphy |first1=Edward E. |last2=Perez-Lopez |first2=Jorge F. |title=Trends in U.S. export prices and OPEC oil prices |journal=Monthly Labor Review |accessdate=2018-06-20 |date=1975 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=6009420&amp;site=ehost-live |via=[[EBSCOhost]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1973 [[Richard Nixon]] said, "Oil without a market, as [[Mohammad Mossadegh|Mr. Mossagedh]] learned many, many years ago, does not do a country much good," referring to the 1951 [[nationalization of the Iranian oil industry]], but between October 1973 and February 1974 the OPEC countries raised by posted price fourfold to nearly $12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1353/hum.2015.0002 |issn=2151-4372 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=63–78 |last=Dietrich |first=Christopher R. W. |title=Mossadegh Madness: Oil and Sovereignty in the Anticolonial Community |journal=Humanity: An International Journal of Human Rights, Humanitarianism, and Development |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of Bretton Woods===
On August 15, 1971, the United States unilaterally [[Nixon Shock|pulled out]] of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods Accord]]. The US abandoned the [[Gold Exchange Standard]] whereby the value of the [[United States dollar|dollar]] had been [[Fixed exchange-rate system|pegged]] to the [[Gold as an investment|price of gold]] and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar, whose value was left to "float" (rise and fall according to market demand).{{sfn|Masouros|2013|pp=55–57}} Shortly thereafter, Britain followed, floating the [[pound sterling]]. The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies. Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time, the industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their [[Money supply|money supplies]]) in amounts far greater than before. The result was a [[Depreciation (currency)|depreciation]] of the&amp;nbsp;dollar and other industrialized nations' currencies. Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased. In September 1971, OPEC issued a joint communiqué stating that, from then on, they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taghizadegan|first1=Rahim|last2=Stöferle|first2=Ronald|last3=Stöferle|first3=Mark|title=Österreichische Schule für Anleger: Austrian Investing zwischen Inflation und Deflation|date=June 13, 2014|publisher=FinanzBuch Verlag|isbn=9783862485949|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Er9SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|language=German|quote=Unsere Mitgliedslander werden alle notwendigen Schritte unternehmen und/oder Verhandlungen mit den Olfirmen fuhren, am Mittel und Wege zu finden, um nachteiligen Auswirkungen auf das Realeinkommen der Mitgliedslander, die sich aus den internationalen monetaren Entwicklungen per August 15, 1971 ergeben, entgegenzuwirken.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This contributed to the "Oil Shock". After 1971, OPEC was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation. From 1947 to 1967, the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year. Until the oil shock, the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities. OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions, so their [[real income]]s lagged. The substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold.&lt;ref&gt;Hammes, David. and Douglas Wills. "Black Gold: The End of Bretton Woods and the Oil-Price Shocks of the 1970s," ''The Independent Review'', v. IX, n. 4, Spring 2005. pp. 501–511.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "oil weapon"===
Arab oil producing countries had attempted to use oil as leverage to influence political events on two prior occasions — the first was the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956 when the United Kingdom, France and Israel invaded Egypt. During the conflict the Syrians sabotaged both the [[Trans-Arabian Pipeline]] and the [[Kirkuk–Baniyas pipeline|Iraq-Baniyas pipeline]], which disrupted the supply of oil to Western Europe.&lt;ref name=ahrari05&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University Press of Kentucky| isbn = 978-0-8131-5665-1| last = Ahrari| first = Mohammed E.| title = OPEC: The Failing Giant| chapter=5.

Although some members of [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OAPEC) supported the use of oil as a weapon to influence the political outcome of the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], Saudi Arabia had traditionally been the strongest supporter of separating oil from politics. The Saudis were wary of the tactic due to the availability of oil from non-Arab oil producing countries, and in the decades leading up to the crisis, the region's conservative monarchies had grown dependent on Western support to ensure their continued survival as [[Nasserism]] gained traction. On the other hand, Algeria, Iraq and Libya had strongly supported the use of oil as a weapon in the conflict.&lt;ref name=ahrari05 /&gt; Arab newspapers like the Egyptian ''[[Al-Ahram]]'', Lebanese ''[[An-Nahar]]'' and Iraqi ''[[Al-Thawra (newspaper)|Al-Thawra]]'' had historically been supportive of the use of oil as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Praeger| isbn = 978-0-275-55810-9| last1 = Sherbiny| first1 = Naiem A.| last2 = Tessler| first2 = Mark A.| title = Arab oil: impact on the Arab countries and global implications| chapter=3.

On October 6, 1973 Egypt attacked the [[Bar Lev Line]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and Syria launched an offensive in the [[Golan Heights]], both of which had been [[Israeli occupied territories|occupied by Israel]] during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. On October 12, 1973, US president [[Richard Nixon]] authorized [[Operation Nickel Grass]], a [[strategic airlift]] to deliver weapons and supplies to Israel in order to replace its [[materiel]] losses,&lt;ref&gt;October 9, 1973 conversation (6:10-6:35 pm) between Israeli Ambassador to the United States Simcha Dinitz, Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft, and Peter Rodman.

==Effectiveness of embargo==

The embargo lasted from October 1973 to March 1974.&lt;ref name=ahrari05 /&gt; Since Israeli forces did not withdraw to the 1949 Armistice Line, the majority of scholars believe the embargo was a failure. Roy Licklieder, in his 1988 book ''[[Political Power and the Arab Oil Weapon]]'', concluded the embargo was a failure because the countries that were targeted by the embargo did not change their policies on the Arab-Israeli conflict. Licklieder believed that any long term changes were caused by the OPEC increase in the posted price of oil, and not the OAPEC embargo. [[Daniel Yergin]], on the other hand, has said that the embargo "remade the international economy".&lt;ref name=graf /&gt;

Over the long term, the oil embargo changed the nature of policy in the West towards increased exploration, alternative energy research, energy conservation and more restrictive monetary policy to better fight inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/energy-crisis |title=Energy Crisis (1970s) – Facts &amp; Summary |publisher=The History Channel |accessdate=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

===Immediate economic effects===
[[File:No gas 1974.gif|thumb|right|upright|A man at a service station reads about the gasoline rationing system in an afternoon newspaper; a sign in the background states that no gasoline is available. 1974]]
The effects of the embargo were immediate. OPEC forced oil companies to increase payments drastically. The price of oil quadrupled by 1974 to nearly US$12 per [[barrel (unit)|barrel]] (75 US$/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/oil/|title=The price of oil – in context|accessdate=May 29, 2007 | work=CBC News| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609145246/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/oil/| archivedate= June 9, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This price increase had a dramatic effect on oil exporting nations, for the countries of the Middle East who had long been dominated by the industrial powers seen to have taken control of a vital commodity. The oil-exporting nations began to accumulate vast wealth.

Some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities, amid shrinking Western demand. Much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions, particularly in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, known as [[Wahhabism]], throughout the world, via religious charities such [[al-Haramain Foundation]], which often also distributed funds to violent Sunni extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-yousaf-butt-/saudi-wahhabism-islam-terrorism_b_6501916.html|title=How Saudi Wahhabism Is the Fountainhead of Islamist Terrorism|first=Yousaf|last=Butt|date=January 20, 2015|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of oil became known as the "oil weapon." It came in the form of an embargo and production cutbacks from the Arab states. The weapon was aimed at the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands. These target governments perceived that the intent was to push them towards a more pro-Arab position.{{sfn|Licklider|1988|p=205-226}} Production was eventually cut by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Arab Oil Weapon—A Threat to International Peace |first=Jordan J. |last=Paust |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Albert P. |last2=Blaustein |journal=The American Journal of International Law |volume=68 |issue=3 |year=1974 |pages=410–439 [p. 411] |doi=10.2307/2200513 |publisher=The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 68, No. 3 |postscript=|jstor=2200513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the affected countries did not undertake dramatic policy changes.{{sfn|Licklider|1988|p=217}}

In the United States, scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973.&lt;!-- ??? --&gt; The possibility that the Middle East could become another superpower confrontation with the USSR was of more concern to the US than oil. Further, interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for Kissinger's dominance.{{sfn|Licklider|1988|pp=217, 219}} In the US production, distribution and price disruptions "have been held responsible for recessions, periods of excessive inflation, reduced productivity, and lower economic growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Oil and the Macroeconomy since the 1970s |first=Robert B. |last=Barsky |first2=Lutz |last2=Kilian |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=18 |issue=4 |year=2004 |pages=115–134 [p. 115] |doi=10.1257/0895330042632708 |postscript= |url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0895330042632708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers regard the 1973 "oil price shock" and the accompanying [[1973–74 stock market crash]] as the first discrete event since the [[Great Depression]] to have a persistent effect on the US economy.&lt;ref name=Perron1988&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Perron, P. |year=1988 |title=The Great Crash, the Oil Price Shock and the Unit Root Hypothesis |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~erp/ERParchives/archivepdfs/M338.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Econometric Research Program, Princeton University Princeton, New Jersey |accessdate=February 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015154333/http://www.princeton.edu/~erp/ERParchives/archivepdfs/M338.pdf |archivedate=October 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gas Stealers Beware 1974.jpg|thumb|right|Gas stealers beware, 1974]]
OPEC-member states raised the prospect of [[nationalization]] of oil company holdings. Most notably, Saudi Arabia nationalized [[Aramco]] in 1980 under the leadership of Saudi oil minister [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani]]. As other OPEC nations followed suit, the cartel's income soared. Saudi Arabia undertook a series of ambitious five-year development plans. The biggest began in 1980, funded at $250&amp;nbsp;billion. Other cartel members also undertook major economic development programs.

US retail price gas prices rose from a national average of 38.5&amp;nbsp;cents in May 1973 to 55.1&amp;nbsp;cents in June 1974. State governments requested citizens not to put up [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas lights]]. [[Oregon]] banned Christmas and commercial lighting altogether.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=318}} Politicians called for a national gas rationing program.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=313}} Nixon requested gasoline stations to voluntarily not sell gasoline on Saturday nights or Sundays; 90% of owners complied, which produced long queues.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=318}}

The embargo was not uniform across Europe. Of the nine members of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), the Netherlands faced a complete embargo, the UK and France received almost uninterrupted supplies (having refused to allow America to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the Arabs and the Israelis), while the other six faced partial cutbacks. The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel, and [[Harold Wilson]]'s government supported the Israelis during the Six-Day War. His successor, [[Edward Heath|Ted Heath]], reversed this policy in 1970, calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders.

The EEC was unable to achieve a common policy during the first month of the War. It issued a statement on November 6, after the embargo and price rises had begun. It was widely viewed as pro-Arab supporting the Franco-British line on the war. OPEC duly lifted its embargo from all EEC members. The price rises had a much greater impact in Europe than the embargo.

Despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo, the UK nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own—a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973–74 became a major factor in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|change of government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E1DB1E38F937A15752C0A964948260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print |title=The World; British Miners Settle for Less |work=New York Times | date= January 24, 1982 | first1=Barbara | last1=Slavin | first2=Milt | last2=Freudenheim | first3=William C. | last3=Rhoden | accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heath asked the British to heat only one room in their houses over the winter.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=319}} The UK, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Norway banned flying, driving and boating on Sundays. Sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil. The Netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=318}}

A few months later, the crisis eased. The embargo was lifted in March 1974 after negotiations at the Washington Oil Summit, but the effects lingered throughout the 1970s. The dollar price of energy increased again the following year, amid the weakening competitive position of the dollar in world markets.

===Price controls and rationing===

====United States====
[[Price controls]] exacerbated the crisis in the US. The system limited the price of "old oil" (that which had already been discovered) while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment. Predictably, old oil was withdrawn from the market, creating greater scarcity. The rule also discouraged development of [[alternative energy|alternative energies]].{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=313}} The rule had been intended to promote [[oil exploration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/75/11/Controls_Nov1975.pdf |format=PDF| title=Oil Price Controls: A Counterproductive Effort | publisher= Federal Reserve Bank of St.&amp;nbsp;Louis Review |date=November 1975| accessdate= June 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarcity was addressed by rationing (as in many countries). Motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=313}}

In 1973, Nixon named [[William E. Simon]] as the first Administrator of the Federal Energy Office, a short-term organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=312}} Simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 that each had consumed in 1972, which worked for states whose populations were not increasing.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=320 }} In other states, lines at gasoline stations were common. The [[American Automobile Association]] reported that in the last week of February 1974, 20% of American gasoline stations had no fuel.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=320}}

[[File:FLAG POLICY DURING THE 1973 oil crisis.gif|thumb|upright|Oregon gasoline dealers displayed signs explaining the flag policy in the winter of 1973–74]]
[[Odd–even rationing]] allowed vehicles with [[license plate]]s having an odd number as the last digit (or a [[vanity plate|vanity license plate]]) to buy gas only on odd-numbered days of the month, while others could buy only on even-numbered days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942763,00.html|title=Gas Fever: Happiness Is a Full Tank |work=Time Magazine | date= February 18, 1974 | accessdate= June 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, a three-color flag system was used to denote gasoline availability at service stations—green for unrationed availability, yellow for restricted/rationed sales and red for out of stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,879272,00.html|title=Spotty Local Starts |work=Time Magazine | date= February 25, 1974 | accessdate= June 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gasoline rations - Bureau of Engraving and Printing.jpg|thumb|left|Gasoline ration stamps printed by the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] in 1974, but not used.]]
Rationing led to violent incidents, when truck drivers chose to strike for two days in December 1973 over the limited supplies Simon had allocated for their industry. In [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]], non-striking truckers were shot at by striking truckers, and in [[Arkansas]], trucks of non-strikers were attacked with bombs.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=320}}

America had controlled the price of natural gas since the 1950s. With the inflation of the 1970s, the price was too low to encourage the search for new reserves.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=321}} America's natural gas reserves dwindled from 237 trillion in 1974 to 203 trillion{{clarify|what units?|date=July 2013}} in 1978.

===Conservation and reduction in demand===

====United States====
To help reduce consumption, in 1974 a [[National Maximum Speed Law|national maximum speed limit]] of 55&amp;nbsp;mph (about 88&amp;nbsp;km/h) was imposed through the [[Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act]]. Development of the [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]] began in 1975, and in 1977 the cabinet-level [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] was created, followed by the [[National Energy Act]] of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 40923435|title = The National Energy Act of 1978|journal = Natural Resources &amp; Environment|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 62–88|last1 = Richardson|first1 = Julia|last2 = Nordhaus|first2 = Robert|year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 28, 1995, [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[National Highway System (United States)#Legislation|National Highway Designation Act]], ending the federal 55&amp;nbsp;mph (89&amp;nbsp;km/h) speed limit, allowing states to restore their prior maximum speed limit.

Year-round daylight saving time was implemented from January 6, 1974, to October 27, 1975, with a break between October 27, 1974 and February 23, 1975, when the country observed standard time. The move spawned significant criticism because it forced many children to travel to school before sunrise. The prior rules were restored in 1976.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[File:potlatch gas.jpg|thumb|Gas stations abandoned during the crisis were sometimes used for other purposes. This station at [[Potlatch, Washington|Potlatch]], Washington, was turned into a [[Revivalism|revival]] hall.]]
The crisis prompted a call to conserve energy, most notably a campaign by the [[Advertising Council]] using the tagline "Don't Be Fuelish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Ad Council – Don't be Fuelish |date=January 1975 |url=http://adland.tv/commercials/ad-council-dont-be-fuelish-1975-030-usa |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jWimLA89?url=http://adland.tv/commercials/ad-council-dont-be-fuelish-1975-030-usa |archivedate=September 4, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many newspapers carried advertisements featuring cut-outs that could be attached to light switches, reading "Last Out, Lights Out: Don't Be Fuelish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Transformation - A Palo Alto Dreamer |first=Jane |last=Horton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, domestic luxury cars with a {{convert|130|in|m|adj=on}} [[wheelbase]] and gross weights averaging 4,500&amp;nbsp;pounds (2,041&amp;nbsp;kg) were no longer made. The automakers had begun phasing out the traditional front engine/rear wheel drive layout in compact cars in favor of lighter front engine/front wheel drive designs. A higher percentage of cars offered more efficient 4-cylinder engines. Domestic auto makers also began offering more fuel efficient diesel powered passenger cars as well.

Although not regulated by the new legislation, auto racing groups voluntarily began conserving. In 1974, [[NASCAR]] reduced all race distances by 10%;{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] race were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Corvette Racing: The Complete Competition History from Sebring to Le Mans |first=David |last=Kimble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Congress created the [[Weatherization Assistance Program]] to help low-income homeowners and renters reduce their demand for heating and cooling through better [[Insulation (for buildings)|insulation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy, nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels.&lt;ref name="GT-DEX-1973-00"&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;OC-73-00&gt;--&gt;[http://cr.middlebury.edu/es/altenergylife/70's.htm The 1970s Energy Crisis]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter Grossman, American energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking, promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities. He wrote that instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation, congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Grossman| first =Peter| title =U.S. Energy Policy and the Pursuit of Failure| publisher =Cambridge University Press| year =2013| pages =416| url =http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item7078295/U-S--Energy-Policy-and-the-Pursuit-of-Failure/?site_locale=en_US| isbn =978-1107005174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian government implemented its "[[Proálcool]]" (pro-alcohol) project in 1975 that mixed [[ethanol]] with gasoline for automotive fuel.&lt;ref name="Bastos"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energytribune.com/articles.cfm?aid=534 |author=Milton Briquet Bastos |title=Brazil’s Ethanol Program – An Insider’s View |publisher=Energy Tribune |date=June 20, 2007 |accessdate=August 14, 2008 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710193215/http://www.energytribune.com/articles.cfm?aid=534 |archivedate=July 10, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel was one of the few countries unaffected by the embargo, since it could extract sufficient oil from the Sinai. But to supplement Israel's over-taxed power grid, [[Harry Zvi Tabor]], the father of [[Solar power in Israel|Israel's solar industry]], developed the prototype for a [[solar water heater]] now used in over 90% of Israeli homes.&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/mar2008/gb20080326_485582.htm?chan=globalbiz_europe+index+page_companies At the Zenith of Solar Energy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101012905/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/mar2008/gb20080326_485582.htm?chan=globalbiz_europe+index+page_companies |date=January 1, 2009 }}, Neal Sandler,''[[BusinessWeek]]'', March 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macroeconomy===
The crisis was a major factor in shifting Japan's economy away from oil-intensive industries. Investment shifted to industries such as electronics. Japanese auto makers also benefited from the crisis. Increased fuel costs allowed their small, fuel-efficient models to gain market share from the "gas-guzzling" American competition. This triggered a drop in American auto sales that lasted into the 1980s.

Western central banks decided to sharply cut interest rates to encourage growth, deciding that inflation was a secondary concern. Although this was the orthodox macroeconomic prescription at the time, the resulting [[stagflation]] surprised economists and central bankers. The policy is now considered by some to have deepened and lengthened the adverse effects of the embargo. Recent research claims that in the period after 1985 the economy became more resilient to energy price increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/erq306_jeske.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, ''How Resilient Is the Modern Economy to Energy Price Shocks?'', 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The price shock created large current account deficits in oil-importing economies. A [[petrodollar recycling]] mechanism was created, through which OPEC surplus funds were channeled through the capital markets to the West to finance the current account deficits. The functioning of this mechanism required the relaxation of [[capital controls]] in oil-importing economies. It marked the beginning of an exponential growth of Western [[capital markets]].{{sfn|Masouros|2013|pp=60–62}}

Many in the public remain suspicious of oil companies, believing they profiteered, or even colluded with OPEC.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In 1974, seven of the fifteen top Fortune 500 companies were oil companies, falling to four in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://fortune.com/fortune500/mckesson-corporation-15/|title = 2014 Fortune 500|date = April 2014|work = |access-date = August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International relations===
The crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from [[United States foreign policy in the Middle East]] to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to pull back from the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Golan Heights]]. By January 18, 1974, [[US Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.&lt;ref name=USstate2ndCrisis/&gt; and again during the [[1979 energy crisis]].

====United States====
America's Cold War policies suffered a major blow from the embargo. They had focused on China and the Soviet Union, but the latent challenge to US hegemony coming from the third world became evident.

In 2004, declassified documents revealed that the U.S. was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973.  Although no explicit plan was mentioned, a conversation between [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[James Schlesinger]] and [[British Ambassador to the United States]] [[Rowland Baring, 3rd Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]] revealed Schlesinger had told him that "it was no longer obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force." British Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of U.S. intentions, which concluded America "might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the U.S. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries," and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and possibly Abu Dhabi if military action was decided upon. Although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force, intelligence warned "the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources, and would result in the ‘total alienation’ of the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalinterest.org/feature/the-time-america-almost-invaded-opec-15726 |title=The Time America Almost Invaded OPEC |last1=Peck |first1=Michael |date=April 10, 2014 |website=National Interest.org |publisher=|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NATO====
Western Europe began switching from pro-Israel to more pro-Arab policies.&lt;ref&gt;America, Russia, and the Cold War, 1945–1975, p. 280, Walter LaFeber, Wiley, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Far Eastern Economic Review, v.84, Apr–Jun 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;8, Review Publishing, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Tensions in Japan, Martin Collick, Richard Storry, p.&amp;nbsp;16, Institute for the Study of Conflict, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; This change strained the Western alliance. The US, which imported only 12% of its oil from the Middle East (compared with 80% for the Europeans and over 90% for Japan), remained staunchly committed to Israel. The percentage of U.S.&amp;nbsp;oil which comes from the nations bordering the Persian Gulf remained steady over the decades, with a figure of a little more than 10% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Afshin Molavi, [http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2009/obama_gulf_oil_and_myth_americas_addiction_10159 "Obama, Gulf Oil and the Myth of America's Addiction"], New America Foundation, ''The National'' (United Arab Emirates), January 21, 2009, .

With the embargo in place, many developed countries altered their policies regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict. These included the UK, which refused to allow the United States to use British bases and [[Cyprus]] to airlift resupplies to Israel along with the rest of the members of the [[European Community]].{{sfn|Licklider|1988|p = 216}}

Canada shifted towards a more pro-Arab position after displeasure was expressed towards Canada's mostly neutral position. "On the other hand, after the embargo the Canadian government moved quickly indeed toward the Arab position, despite its low dependence on Middle Eastern oil".{{sfn|Licklider|1988|p = 214}}

====Japan====
Although lacking historical connections to the Middle East, Japan was the country most dependent on Arab oil. 71% of its imported oil came from the Middle East in 1970. On November 7, 1973, the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments declared Japan a "nonfriendly" country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy. It received a 5% production cut in December, causing a panic. On November 22, Japan issued a statement "asserting that Israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories, advocating Palestinian self-determination, and threatening to reconsider its policy toward Israel if Israel refused to accept these preconditions".{{sfn|Licklider|1988|p = 214}} By December 25, Japan was considered an Arab-friendly state.

====Nonaligned nations====
The oil embargo was announced roughly one month after a [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|right-wing military coup]] in [[Chile]] led by General [[Augusto Pinochet]] toppled socialist president [[Salvador Allende]] on September 11, 1973. The response of the Nixon administration was to propose doubling arms sales. As a consequence, an opposing Latin American bloc was organized and financed in part by Venezuelan oil revenues, which quadrupled between 1970 and 1975.

A year after the start of the embargo, the UN's nonaligned bloc passed a resolution demanding the creation of a "[[New International Economic Order]]" under which nations within the global South would receive a greater share of benefits derived from the exploitation of southern resources and greater control over their self-development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/s6r3201.htm|title=A/RES/S-6/3201 - Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Assembly|first=United Nations General|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arab states====
Prior to the embargo, the geo-political competition between the Soviet Union and the United States, in combination with low oil prices that hindered the necessity and feasibility of alternative energy sources, presented the Arab States with financial security, moderate economic growth, and disproportionate international bargaining power.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie Ovendale, ''The Origins of the Arab-Israeli Wars'' (New York: Pearson Longman, 2004), p. 184-191 and 197&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil shock disrupted the status quo relationships between Arab countries and the US and USSR. At the time, Egypt, Syria and Iraq were allied with the USSR, while Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran (plus Israel) aligned with the US. Vacillations in alignment often resulted in greater support from the respective superpowers.

When [[Anwar Sadat]] became president of Egypt in 1970, he dismissed Soviet specialists in Egypt and reoriented towards the US. Concerns over economic domination from increased Soviet oil production turned into fears of military aggression after the [[Soviet–Afghan War|1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], turning the Persian Gulf states towards the US for security guarantees against Soviet military action.

The USSR's invasion of Afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region, also marked by increased American weapons sales, technology, and outright military presence. Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the [[Persian Gulf]] and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Wilson "U.S.&amp;nbsp;Military Sales To Saudis 5 Times Total For Israelis", ''Washington Post'' October 11, 1979, pg. A24&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of [[Islamism]], a reality which would quickly be revealed in the [[Grand Mosque seizure]] in Mecca by [[Wahhabi]] extremists during November 1979, and a Shiite Muslim revolt in the oil rich [[Al-Hasa]] region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year, which was known as the [[1979 Qatif Uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saudi Arabia]] is a near absolute monarchy, an Arabic speaking country, and has a [[Sunni]] Muslim majority, while Persian speaking [[Iran]] since 1979 is an Islamist theocracy with a [[Shiite]] Muslim majority, which explains the current hostility between Saudi Arabia and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rubin, ''Iran and Saudi Arabia's 'Hate-Hate' Relationship''. (http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/11/iran-and-saudi-arabias-hate-hate-relationship/). CNN, October 11, 2011, 8:00 PM ET.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automobile industry===
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}
The oil crisis sent a signal to the auto industry globally, which changed many aspects of production and usage for decades to come.

====Western Europe====
After World War II, most West European countries taxed motor fuel to limit imports, and as a result most cars made in Europe were smaller and more economical than their American counterparts. By the late 1960s increasing incomes supported rising car sizes.

The oil crisis pushed West European car buyers away from larger, less economical cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20131014/GLOBAL/131019959/10-ways-the-1973-oil-embargo-changed-the-industry|title=10 ways the 1973 oil embargo changed the industry|first=James B.|last=Treece|publisher=|accessdate=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable result of this transition was the rise in popularity of compact [[hatchback]]s. The only notable small hatchbacks built in Western Europe before the oil crisis were the [[Peugeot&amp;nbsp;104]], [[Renault&amp;nbsp;5]] and [[Fiat&amp;nbsp;127]]. By the end of the decade, the market had expanded with the introduction of the [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Opel Kadett]] (sold as the [[Vauxhall Astra]] in Great Britain), [[Chrysler Sunbeam]] and [[Citroën Visa]].

Buyers looking for larger cars were increasingly drawn to medium-sized hatchbacks. Virtually unknown in Europe in 1973, by the end of the decade they were gradually replacing [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]]s as the mainstay of this sector. Between 1973 and 1980, medium-sized hatchbacks were launched across Europe: the [[Chrysler Horizon|Chrysler/Simca Horizon]], [[Fiat Ritmo]] (Strada in the UK), [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort MK3]], [[Renault&amp;nbsp;14]], [[Volvo 300 Series|Volvo 340 / 360]], [[Opel Kadett]], and [[Volkswagen Golf]].

These cars were considerably more economical than the traditional [[Saloon (car)|saloons]] they were replacing, and attracted buyers who traditionally bought larger vehicles. Some 15&amp;nbsp;years after the oil crisis, hatchbacks dominated most European small and medium car markets, and had gained a substantial share of the large family car market.

====United States====
{{See also|Malaise era}}
{{See also|Automotive industry in the United States}}

Before the energy crisis, large, heavy, and powerful cars were popular. By 1971, the standard engine in a [[Chevrolet Caprice#1969–1970|Chevrolet Caprice]] was a 400-cubic inch (6.5&amp;nbsp;liter) V8. The wheelbase of this car was {{convert|121.5|in|mm}}, and ''Motor Trend''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 1972 road test of the similar [[Chevrolet Impala]] achieved no more than 15&amp;nbsp;highway miles per gallon. In the fifteen years prior to the 1973 oil crisis, gasoline prices in the U.S. had lagged well behind inflation.&lt;ref name=gpcutinf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1t1VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A9gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4393%2C4881980 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon)|agency=Associated Press |title=Gas prices catch up to inflation |date=February 24, 1974 |page=6A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis reduced the demand for large cars.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p = 321}} Japanese imports, primarily the [[Toyota Corona]], the [[Toyota Corolla]], the [[Datsun B210]], the [[Datsun&amp;nbsp;510]], the [[Honda Civic (first generation)|Honda Civic]], the [[Mitsubishi Galant]] (a captive import from Chrysler sold as the [[Dodge Colt]]), the [[Subaru Leone|Subaru DL]], and later the [[Honda Accord]] all had [[straight 4|four cylinder engines]] that were more fuel efficient than the typical American [[V8 engine|V8]] and [[straight 6|six cylinder engines]]. Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with [[unibody]] construction and front-wheel drive, which became [[de facto standard]]s.

From Europe, the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], the [[Volkswagen Type 3|Volkswagen Fastback]], the [[Renault&amp;nbsp;8]], the [[Renault 5|Renault LeCar]], and the [[Fiat 131|Fiat Brava]] were successful. Detroit responded with the [[Ford Pinto]], the [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]], the [[GM H platform (RWD)|Chevrolet Vega]], the [[GM X platform (RWD)|Chevrolet Nova]], the [[Chrysler A platform|Plymouth Valiant]] and the [[Chrysler F platform|Plymouth Volaré]]. American Motors sold its homegrown [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]], [[AMC Hornet|Hornet]] and [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]] models.

Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the [[Toyota Corona Mark&amp;nbsp;II]], the [[Toyota Cressida]], the [[Mazda Capella#616/618 (USA)|Mazda&amp;nbsp;616]] and [[Datsun 810]], which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle. A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 [[voluntary export restraints]], opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands.

Compact trucks were introduced, such as the [[Toyota Hilux]] and the [[Datsun Truck]], followed by the [[Mazda B-Series (North America)|Mazda Truck]] (sold as the [[Ford Courier]]), and the Isuzu-built [[Chevrolet LUV]]. Mitsubishi rebranded its [[Mitsubishi Triton|Forte]] as the [[Mitsubishi Triton|Dodge D-50]] a few years after the oil crisis. Mazda, Mitsubishi and Isuzu had joint partnerships with Ford, Chrysler, and GM, respectively. Later the American makers introduced their domestic replacements (Ford Ranger, Dodge Dakota and the Chevrolet S10/GMC S-15), ending their [[captive import]] policy.

An increase in imported cars into North America forced General Motors, Ford and Chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models for domestic sales. The [[Dodge Omni]] / [[Plymouth Horizon]] from Chrysler, the [[Ford Fiesta]] and the [[Chevrolet Chevette]] all had four-cylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s. By 1985, the average American vehicle moved 17.4&amp;nbsp;miles per gallon, compared to 13.5 in 1970. The improvements stayed even though the price of a barrel of oil remained constant at $12 from 1974 to 1979.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p = 321}}
Sales of large sedans for most makes (except [[Chrysler]] products) recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis. The [[Cadillac DeVille]] and [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham|Fleetwood]], [[Buick Electra]], [[Oldsmobile 98]], [[Lincoln Continental]], [[Mercury Marquis]], and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid-1970s. The only full-size models that did not recover were lower price models such as the [[Chevrolet Bel Air]] and [[Ford Galaxie 500]]. Slightly smaller models such as the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]], [[Ford Thunderbird]] and various others sold well.

Economical imports succeeded alongside heavy, expensive vehicles. In 1976 Toyota sold 346,920 cars (average weight around 2,100&amp;nbsp;lbs), while Cadillac sold 309,139 cars (average weight around 5,000&amp;nbsp;lbs).

Federal safety standards, such as NHTSA Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 215 (pertaining to safety bumpers), and compacts like the 1974 Mustang I were a prelude to the DOT "downsize" revision of vehicle categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date = February 2008|publisher=Collectible Automobile |title=Designing Cars of the 1970s: Freedoms Lost}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1977, GM's full-sized cars reflected the crisis.&lt;ref name="Collectible Automobile"&gt;{{Cite news |title=GM's full-sized cars |date=March 2008 |publisher=Collectible Automobile}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1979, virtually all "full-size" American cars had shrunk, featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions. [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year, moving instead to a full [[front wheel drive|front-wheel drive]] lineup for 1982 (except for the [[Chrysler M platform|M-body]] [[Dodge Diplomat]]/[[Plymouth Gran Fury]] and [[Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue]] sedans).

==Decline of OPEC==
{{further|1980s oil glut}}
OPEC soon lost its preeminent position, and in 1981, its production was surpassed by that of other countries. Additionally, its own member nations were divided. Saudi Arabia, trying to recover market share, increased production, pushing prices down, shrinking or eliminating profits for high-cost producers. The world price, which had peaked during the [[1979 energy crisis]] at nearly $40 per barrel, decreased during the 1980s to less than $10 per barrel. Adjusted for inflation, oil briefly fell back to pre-1973 levels. This "sale" price was a windfall for oil-importing nations, both developing and developed.

The embargo encouraged new venues for energy exploration including [[Alaska]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Caspian Sea]], and the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Yergin|2008|pp = 619-625}} Exploration in the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian Basin]] and [[Siberia]] became profitable. Cooperation changed into a far more adversarial relationship as the USSR increased its production. By 1980 the Soviet Union had become the world's largest producer.&lt;ref&gt;"World: Saudis Edge U.S. on Oil" in ''Washington Post'' January 3, 1980, pg. D2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dusko Doder "Soviet Production of Gas, Oil Set Records Over 6 Months" in ''Washington Post'' August 14, 1980, pg. A24&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the decline in prices and economic and geopolitical power of OPEC came from the move to alternative energy sources. OPEC had relied on [[price elasticity of demand|price inelasticity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Patrick L. |url=http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=1247 |title=Approx. PED of Various Products (U.S.) |publisher=Mackinac.org |date=November 13, 1997 |accessdate=September 3, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721175957/http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=1247| archivedate= July 21, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; to maintain high consumption, but had underestimated the extent to which conservation and other sources of supply would eventually reduce demand. [[Electricity generation]] from [[nuclear power]] and [[natural gas]], home heating from natural gas, and [[ethanol]]-blended gasoline all reduced the demand for oil.

The drop in prices presented a serious problem for oil-exporting countries in northern Europe and the [[Persian Gulf]]. Heavily populated, impoverished countries, whose economies were largely dependent on oil—including [[Mexico]], [[Nigeria]], [[Algeria]], and [[Libya]]—did not prepare for a market reversal that left them in sometimes desperate situations.

When reduced demand and increased production glutted the world market in the mid-1980s, oil prices plummeted and the cartel lost its unity. Mexico (a non-member), Nigeria, and [[Venezuela]], whose economies had expanded in the 1970s, faced near-bankruptcy, and even Saudi Arabian economic power was significantly weakened. The divisions within OPEC made concerted action more difficult. {{as of|2015}}, OPEC had never approached its earlier dominance.

By [[Ruth Sheldon Knowles]], [[Phillips Petroleum Company]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beyond the petroleum age: designing a solar economy. By [[Christopher Flavin]], [[Nicholas K. Lenssen]]. Worldwatch Institute, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the era in human history characterised by an increased use of [[petroleum]] in products and as fuel. Though unrefined petroleum has been used for various purposes since ancient times, it was during the 19th century that refinement techniques were developed and [[gasoline]] engines were created.

Although crude petroleum oil has been used for a variety of purposes for thousands of years, the Oil Age is considered to have started in the 1800s with the advance of drilling techniques, as well as the processing of products made use in [[internal combustion engine]]s. Alternatively, the age of oil can be placed in the first period until the early 1900s, when oil consumption and combustion engines utilization increased. Contemporary industrial society is built largely on petroleum resources, but the future of the Oil Age has become increasingly controversial.

==History==
Since the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[fossil fuel]]s have been used as sources of energy. [[Coal]] began to be widely used after 1800 and would continue to be the dominant source of energy into the twentieth century. However, two events set the stage for the Age of Oil: The first was in 1846, when [[Abraham Gesner]] invented [[kerosene]] making coal and petroleum practical raw materials for lighting fuel. The second was in 1859, when [[Edwin Drake]] invented the first modern drilling process for deep oil wells. [[John Davison Rockefeller]] founded the [[Standard Oil]] Company, which dominated the oil industry and was the first great U.S. business trust. In 1870, he founded Standard Oil Company and aggressively ran it until he officially retired in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/rockefeller/bio2.htm |title=John D. and Standard Oil |accessdate=2008-05-13 |publisher=Bowling Green State University | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080504162252/http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/rockefeller/bio2.htm |archivedate= 2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Friedrich Benz]] developed a [[petrol]]-powered [[automobile]]s by 1878 and, in 1879, obtained a patent for the practical automobile. The invention of the internal combustion engine was the major influence in the rise in the importance of petroleum.

The beginning of the contemporaneous age of oil is commonly thought of originating in 1901 with the strike at [[Spindletop]] by [[Croatia]]n oil explorer [[Anthony Francis Lucas|Antun Lučić]] and Texan Patillo Higgins, near [[Beaumont, Texas]] in the United States which launched large-scale oil production and soon made the petroleum products widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Maugeri (2005), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Powered by the increased use of petroleum, the [[post–World War II economic expansion]] was a period of economic prosperity in the mid-20th century which occurred, following the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, and lasted until the early 1970s. It ended with the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In 1956, Geophysicist [[M. King Hubbert]] deduces that U.S. oil production will peak between 1965 and 1970 (peaked in 1971) and that oil production will peak "within half a century" on the basis of 1956 data.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Hubbert peak theory]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, another  predicted peak was by [[Colin Campbell (geologist)|Colin Campbell]]&lt;ref&gt;"Oil Price Leap in the Early Nineties," Noroil, December 1989, pages 35–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s and 1970s, when petroleum production peaked in many industrialized nations, a frequent topic of speculation among scholars has been when worldwide production will peak, as well as when and how the oil age will ultimately end. According to some definitions the age is defined as ending at the point where consumption outstrips the decreasing production making its use unprofitable or impossible.

===Contemporary oil===
With the dawning of the so-called [[Atomic Age]] many observers in the mid-20th century believed that the Oil Age was rapidly coming to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The New Republic | volume=113 | page=831 | author=Croly, Herbert David | year=1945 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5TUQAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid change to atomic power envisioned during this period never materialized, in part due to [[Environmental impact of nuclear power|environmental fears]] following high-profile accidents such as the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] and the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]].

[[Peak oil]] is the point in time when the maximum rate of petroleum extraction is reached, after which the rate of production is expected to enter terminal decline.  Many believe that we are at or close to the peak, positioning us in the second half of the oil age.&lt;ref name="hirsch_report"&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Caligae from side.jpg|thumb|A reproduction of a Roman ''caliga'']]
'''Caligae''' ([[Latin]]; singular {{lang|la|caliga}}) are heavy-soled [[hobnail]]ed military [[boots]] known for being issued to [[Roman army|Roman]] [[Roman legion|legionary]] soldiers and [[auxilia]]ries throughout the [[Roman Republic]]{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and [[Roman Empire|Empire]].

==Name and history==
[[File:Caliga Qasr Ibrim.jpg|left|thumb|An original {{lang|la|caliga}} found at [[Qasr Ibrim]], [[Egypt]], {{circa}} 1st century BC – 1st century AD.]]  Caligae (singular ''caliga'') were heavy-duty, thick-soled [[openwork]] boots, with [[hobnail]]ed soles. Caliga comes from the Latin 'callus' meaning hard, as hobnails were hammered into hard leather soles before being sewn onto a softer leather lattice. They were worn by the lower ranks of Roman cavalrymen and foot-soldiers, and possibly by some centurions.&lt;ref&gt;Scholarly assertions that either all or no centurions should be considered ''caligati'' rest on assumptions that the conditions among the centurion class remained constant throughout the army, without exceptions. The problem is discussed in J. F. Gilliam, "Milites Caligati", ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', Vol. 77 (1946), pp. 183-191, Published by The Johns Hopkins University Press, DOI: 10.2307/283455, available at [[JSTOR]] (subscription required) Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/283455&lt;/ref&gt; A durable association of caligae with the common soldiery is evident in the latter's description as ''caligati'' ("booted ones").&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, N., ''in'' Sebesta, Judith Lynn, and Bonfante, Larissa, editors, ''The World of Roman Costume: Wisconsin Studies in Classics'', The University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, pp. 122, 125&lt;/ref&gt; In the early first century AD, the soldiery affectionately nicknamed the two or three year old [[Caligula|Gaius]] "Caligula" ("little boot"), because he wore a diminutive soldier's outfit, complete with small ''caligae''.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#9 9.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. J. V. Malloch, "Gaius and the nobiles", ''Athenaeum '', (2009), pp. 489-506.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, hobnailed ''caligae'' must have proved inconvenient, especially on hard surfaces; [[Josephus]] describes the killing of a ''caliga''-shod Roman centurion who had slipped on the Temple of Jerusalem's marble floor during an attack.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Gilliam, "Milites Caligati", ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', Vol. 77 (1946), pp. 183-191, Published by The Johns Hopkins University Press, DOI: 10.2307/283455, available at [[JSTOR]] (subscription required) Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/283455&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the design of the ''caliga'' allowed for its adjustment, which would have helped reduce chafing; it probably made an "ideal marching boot",&lt;ref&gt;Carol van Driel-Murray, "Vindolanda and the Dating of Roman Footwear", ''Britannia'', Vol. 32 (2001), p. 185-197, Published by: Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, DOI: 10.2307/526955, available at [[JSTOR]] (subscription required) Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/526955&lt;/ref&gt; and "the thunderous sound of an attack by a hobnailed army (''caligati'') must have been terrifying."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, N., ''in'' Sebesta, Judith Lynn, and Bonfante, Larissa, editors, ''The World of Roman Costume: Wisconsin Studies in Classics'', The University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

''Caligae'' would have been cooler on the march than enclosed boots. In warm, Mediterranean climates, this may have been an advantage. In northern Britain's cold, wet climate, additional woven socks or raw wool wadding in winter may have helped insulate the feet; but ''caligae'' seemed to have been abandoned there by the end of the second century AD, in favour of civilian-style "closed boots" (''[[Carbatina (shoe)|carbatinae]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Carol van Driel-Murray, "Vindolanda and the Dating of Roman Footwear", ''Britannia'', Vol. 32 (2001), p. 193 - 195, Published by: Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, DOI: 10.2307/526955, available at [[JSTOR]] (subscription required) Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/526955&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 4th century, this seems to have applied throughout the Empire. The emperor [[Diocletian]]'s [[Edict on Prices]] (301) includes set prices for ''caligae'' with no hobnails, made for civilian men, women and children.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, N., ''in'' Sebesta, Judith Lynn, and Bonfante, Larissa, editors, ''The World of Roman Costume: Wisconsin Studies in Classics'', The University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, pp. 122, 125, citing Isidore of Seville, ''Origines'', 9. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and manufacture===

The caliga's [[midsole]] and the [[openwork]] upper were cut from a single piece of high quality cow or ox-hide. An [[outsole]] was fastened to the mid-sole, using clinched [[hobnail]]s, usually of iron but occasionally bronze. The clinched hobnail ends were covered by an [[insole]]. Like all Roman footwear, the ''caliga'' was flat-soled. It was laced up the center of the foot and onto the top of the ankle. [[Isidore of Seville]] believed that the name "''caliga''" derived from the Latin ''callus'' ("hard leather"), or else from the fact that the boot was laced or tied on (''ligere''). Strapwork styles varied from maker to maker and region to region. The placement of hobnails is less variable; they functioned to give both grip and foot-support, much like a modern sports shoe. At least one provincial manufacturer of army ''caligae'' has been identified by name.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, N., ''in'' Sebesta, Judith Lynn, and Bonfante, Larissa, editors, ''The World of Roman Costume: Wisconsin Studies in Classics'', The University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, pp. 104, 122, 123, citing Isidore, ''Origines'', 9. 34, and van Driel-Murray, "Vindolanda and the Dating of Roman Footwear", (2001), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Charles Dugas naît à [[Alès]] en 1885 dans une famille protestante des [[Cévennes]]. Ancien étudiant du lycée d'Alès et du [[lycée Henri-IV]], il est élève de l'[[École Normale Supérieure]], [[Agrégation in France|agrégé de lettres]] and [[docteur ès lettres]]&lt;ref name="Perrin"&gt;{{Cite web|language=fr|first1=Charles-Edmond|last1=Perrin|title=Éloge funèbre de M.

Au fur et à mesure de ses recherches, il s'intéresse plus particulièrement à la céramique grecque, discipline dans laquelle ses œuvres (cf. below) servent encore de référence. Il étudie entre autres les sites archéologiques de [[Tegea]], [[Delphi]], [[Delos]].

Parallèlement à ces recherches, il enseigne à l'[[French School at Athens]], dès 1908, sous la direction de M. Holleaux&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efa.gr/histoire/listAlphabeticMembres2.pdf Liste des membres de l'EFA]&lt;/ref&gt; Lors de la Première Guerre mondiale, il demeure à Athènes comme membre libre de l'École et officie comme interprète auprès de l'attaché naval français à Athène. Il prend part au développement de la propagande intellectuelle mise en place par la France en Grèce, sous couvert de son travail comme membre libre de l'École&lt;ref&gt;''Politique méditerranéenne'', de Jean-Robert Henry et Gérard Groc, Karthala-IREMAM, Paris, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; À l'issue de la guerre, il publie ses observations sur la situation politique grecque intitulé ''Les étapes de la crise grecque (1915-1918)'', under the pseudonym Charles Frégier.&lt;ref name="Perrin"/&gt;

De retour en France, il enseigne d'abord à la Faculté des lettres de Montpellier en 1919 puis à la Faculté des lettres de Lyon en 1928, avant d'en devenir le doyen en 1939. Il est frappé de révocation par le [[Vichy Regime]] durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale&lt;ref name="Perrin"/&gt; Il a été de plus reconnu par ses pairs pour avoir fait disparaître des listes d'étudiants juifs de la faculté de lettres de Lyon lors de l'occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=fr|first1=Henri|last1=Metzger|author1-link=Henri Metzger|title=Charles Dugas|journal=Annales de l’Université de Lyon|year=1956-1958|pages=3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Il devient en 1942 membre de l'[[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aibl.fr/fr/membres/home.html Membres de l'Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres.]&lt;/ref&gt; et premier secrétaire de la Fédération internationale des associations d'études classiques (FIEC) between 1948 and 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiecnet.org/fr/storia5.htm Histoire de la FIEC par François PASCHOUD.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenu dans sa région natale à proximité de [[Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort]] à sa retraite, il meurt en 1957 à la clinique de Montpellier et repose au cimetière de Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort&lt;ref name="Perrin"/&gt;. On peut aujourd'hui admirer nombre de ses découvertes au [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]], ainsi que son portrait à l'[[French School at Athens]] et sur le site de fouilles de Délos.

== Works ==
Si Charles Dugas s'intéresse au début de sa carrière à tous les champs de l'archéologie grecque, il se spécialise dans l'étude des vases et de la céramique essentiellement après la découverte des centaines de vases de l'Héraion de Délos qu'il répertorie, étudie et classe.&lt;ref name="Perrin"/&gt; Il dirige le projet de recherche ''[[Corpus vasorum antiquorum]]'' à partir de 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=fr|first1=Jean|last1=Charbonneaux|title=Allocution de M.

Il y soulève également de nouveaux thèmes de recherche dont la question des vases [[Milos|méliens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=fr|first1=Anne|last1=Coulié |title=Histoire et archéologie des Cyclades à travers la céramique archaïque : à propos d'un ouvrage récent|journal=Revue Archéologique|issue=40|year=1958|pages=255-281|url=http://www.cairn.info/revue-archeologique-2005-2-page-255.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plus généralement, il s'intéresse à l'imagerie des vases et leur lien avec la tradition littéraire ou mythologique&lt;ref name="Perrin"/&gt;

'''Classical compounds''' and '''neoclassical compounds''' are [[compound (linguistics)|compound word]]s composed from '''combining forms''' (which act as [[affix]]es or [[word stem|stems]]) derived from [[classical Latin]] or [[ancient Greek]] [[root (linguistics)|roots]]. [[New Latin]] comprises many such words and is a substantial component of the [[technology|technical]] and [[science|scientific]] [[lexicon]] of [[English language|English]] and other languages, including [[international scientific vocabulary]]. For example, ''[[wikt:bio-#Prefix|bio-]]'' combines with ''[[wikt:-graphy#Suffix|-graphy]]'' to form ''[[biography]]'' ("life" + "writing/recording").

==Source of international technical vocabulary==
{{main article|International scientific vocabulary}}
Classical compounds represent a significant source of [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] vocabulary.  Moreover, since these words are composed from [[classical language]]s whose prestige is or was respected throughout the Western European culture, these words typically appear in many different languages.  Their widespread use makes [[technical writing]] generally accessible to readers who may only have a smattering of the language in which it appears.

Not all Western European languages have been equally receptive to classical technical compounds.  [[German language|German]] and [[Russian Language|Russian]], for instance, have historically attempted to create their own technical vocabularies from native elements.  Usually, these creations are German and Russian [[calques]] on the international vocabulary, such as ''Wasserstoff'' and "Водород" for ''[[hydrogen]]''.  Like any exercise in [[prescription and description|language prescription]], this endeavour has been only partially successful, so while official German may still speak of a ''Fernsprecher'', public [[telephone]]s will be labelled with the internationally recognized ''Telefon''.

==Formation, spelling, and pronunciation==
{{Main article|Traditional English pronunciation of Latin}}
These words are compounds formed from Latin and Ancient Greek root words.  Ancient Greek words are almost invariably romanized (see [[transliteration of Ancient Greek into English]]). In English: 
*Ancient Greek ''αι'' becomes ''e'' or sometimes ''æ''/''ae'' in [[British English]];
*Ancient Greek groups with ''γ'' plus a velar [[stop consonant]] such as ''γγ'', ''γκ'' or ''γξ'' become ''ng'', ''nc'' (or ''nk'' in more recent borrowings) and ''nx'' respectively;
*Ancient Greek ''ει'' often becomes ''i'' (occasionally it is retained as ''ei'');
*Ancient Greek ''θ'' becomes ''th'';
*Ancient Greek ''κ'' becomes ''c'' (subject to [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] in English pronunciation) or ''k''; 
*Ancient Greek ''οι'' becomes ''e'' or sometimes ''œ''/''oe'' in British English;
*Ancient Greek ''ου'' usually becomes ''u'', or occasionally ''ou'';
*Ancient Greek ''{{lang|grc|ῥ}}'' ([[rho]] with ''[[spiritus asper]]'') becomes ''rh'';
*Ancient Greek ''υ'' becomes ''y'';
*Ancient Greek ''φ'' becomes ''ph'' or, very rarely, ''f'';
*Ancient Greek ''χ'' becomes ''ch'';
*Ancient Greek ''ψ'' becomes ''ps'';
*Ancient Greek ''ω'' becomes ''o'';
*Ancient Greek rough breathing becomes ''h-''.
Thus, for example, Ancient Greek ''σφιγξ'' becomes English (and Latin) ''[[sphinx]]''.  Exceptions to these romanizing rules occur, such as ''[[leukemia]] (leukaemia)''; compare ''[[leukocyte]]'', also ''leucocyte''.  In Latin, and in the target languages, the Greek vowels are given their classical values rather than their contemporary values in [[demotic Greek]].

Ancient Greek words often contain [[consonant cluster]]s which are foreign to the [[phonology]] of contemporary English and other languages that incorporate these words into their lexicon: ''[[diphthong]]''; ''[[pneumatology]]'', ''[[Tuberculosis|phthisis]]''.  The traditional response in English is to treat the unfamiliar cluster as containing one or more [[silent letter]]s and suppress their pronunciation, more ''modern'' speakers tend to try and pronounce the unusual cluster.  This adds to the irregularities of [[English spelling]]; moreover, since many of these words are encountered in writing more often than they are heard spoken, it introduces uncertainty as to how to pronounce them when encountered.

Classical compounds frequently vary their stressed syllable when [[Affix|suffixes]] are added: ''[[agriculture|'''á'''griculture]], agric'''ú'''ltural.''  This also gives rise to uncertainty when these words are encountered in print.  Once a classical compound has been created and [[linguistic borrowing|borrowed]], it typically becomes the foundation of a whole series of related words: e.g. ''[[astrology]], astrological, astrologer/astrologist/astrologian, astrologism''.

Mainstream medical New Latin and ISV pronunciation in English is not the same as [[Classical Latin]] pronunciation. Like [[Ecclesiastical Latin]], it has a regularity of its own, and individual sounds can be mapped or compared. Although the Classical Latin pronunciation of ''venae cavae'' would be approximately {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɛ|n|aɪ|ˈ|k|ɑː|v|aɪ}}, the standard English medical pronunciation is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|iː|n|iː|ˈ|k|eɪ|v|iː}}.

== History and reception ==
English began incorporating many of these words in the sixteenth century; ''[[geography]]'' first appeared in an English text in 1535. Other early adopted words that still survive include ''[[mystagogue]]'', from the 1540s, and ''[[androgyne]]'', from the 1550s.  The use of these technical terms predates the [[scientific method]]; the several varieties of [[divination]] all take their names from Classical compounds, such as ''[[alectryomancy]]'', divination by the pecking of [[chicken]]s.

Not all English writers have been friendly to the inflow of Classical vocabulary.  The Tudor period writer Sir [[John Cheke]] wrote:

{{quote|I am of this opinion that our own tung should be written cleane and pure, unmixt and unmangeled with borrowing of other tunges; wherein if we take not heed by tiim, ever borowing and never paying, she shall be fain to keep her house as bankrupt.}}

and therefore rejected what he called "[[inkhorn term]]s".

Similar sentiments moved the nineteenth century author [[William Barnes]] to write "pure English," in which he avoided Greco-Latin words and find [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] equivalents therefor: for Barnes, the newly invented art of the ''[[photograph]]'' became a ''sun-print''.  Unlike this one, some of Barnes's coinages caught on, such as ''[[foreword]]'', Barnes's replacement for the ''[[preface]]'' of a book.  Later, [[Poul Anderson]] wrote a jocular piece called ''[[Uncleftish Beholding]]'' in a [[constructed language]] based on English which others have called "Ander-Saxon"; this attempted to create a pure English vocabulary for [[nuclear physics]]. For more information, see [[Linguistic purism in English]].

== More recent developments ==
Many such words, such as ''[[thermometer]]'', ''[[dinosaur]]'', ''[[rhinoceros]]'', and ''[[rhododendron]]'', are thoroughly incorporated into the English lexicon and are the ordinary words for their referents.  Some are prone to [[colloquialism|colloquial]] shortening; ''rhinoceros'' often becomes ''rhino''. The [[binomial nomenclature]] of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and [[biology]] is a major source for these items of vocabulary; for many unfamiliar species that lack a common English name, the name of the [[genus]] becomes the English word for that life form.

In the [[SI|metric system]], prefixes that indicate [[Multiplication|multiplier]]s are typically Greek in origin, such as ''kilogram'', while those that indicate [[divisor]]s are Latin, as in ''millimeter'': the base roots resemble Greek words, but in truth are [[neologism]]s.  These metric and other suffixes are added to native English roots as well, resulting in creations such as ''[[gigabyte]]''.  Words of mixed Latin and Greek lineage, or words that combine elements of the classical languages with English – so-called [[hybrid word]]s – were formerly castigated as "[[Barbarism (linguistics)|barbarism]]s" by [[prescription and description|prescriptionist]] usage commentators; this disapproval has mostly abated. Indeed, in scientific nomenclature, even more exotic hybrids have appeared, such as for example the dinosaur ''[[Yangchuanosaurus]]''. Personal [[name]]s appear in some scientific names such as ''[[Fuchsia]]''.

Classical compounds are sometimes used to lend grandeur or the impression of scientific rigour to humble pursuits: the study of ''[[cosmetology]]'' will not help anyone become an ''[[astronaut]]''.  Compounds along these models are also sometimes coined for humorous effect, such as ''odontopodology'', the science of putting your foot into your mouth.  These humorous coinages sometimes take on a life of their own, such as ''[[garbology]]'', the study of [[waste|garbage]].

Some classical compounds form [[classical plural]]s, and are therefore irregular in English.  Others do not, while some vacillate between classical and regular plurals.

==Translation==
There are hundreds of classical compounds in English and other European languages. As traditionally defined, they cannot stand alone as free words, but there are many exceptions to this rule, and in the late 20th century such forms are increasingly used independently: ''bio'' as a clipping of ''biography'', ''telly'' as a respelt clipping of ''television''. Most classical compounds translate readily into everyday language, especially nouns: ''bio-'' as ‘life’ ''-graphy'' as ‘writing, description’. Because of this, the compounds of which they are part (usually ''classical'' or ''learned compounds'') can be more or less straightforwardly paraphrased: ''biography'' as ‘writing about a life’, ''neurology'' as ‘the study of the nervous system’. Many classical compounds are designed to take initial or final position: ''autobiography'' has the two initial or preposed forms ''auto-'', ''bio-'', and one postposed form ''-graphy''. Although most occupy one position or the other, some can occupy both: ''-graph-'' as in ''graphology'' and ''monograph''; ''-phil-'' as in ''philology'' and ''Anglophile''. Occasionally, the same base is repeated in one word: ''logology'' the study of words, ''phobophobia'' the fear of fear.

===Preposed and postposed===
Prefixes include: ''aero-'' air, ''crypto-'' hidden, ''demo-'' people, ''geo-'' earth, ''odonto-'' tooth, ''ornitho-'' bird, ''thalasso'' sea. Many have both a traditional simple meaning and a modern telescopic meaning: in ''biology'', ''bio-'' means ‘life’, but in ''[[biodegradation|bio-degradable]]'' it telescopes ‘biologically’; although ''hypno-'' basically means ‘sleep’ (''hypnopaedia'' learning through sleep), it also stands for ‘hypnosis’ (''hypnotherapy'' cure through hypnosis).

When a form stands alone as a present-day word, it is usually a telescopic abbreviation: ''bio'' biography, ''chemo'' chemotherapy, ''hydro'' hydroelectricity, ''metro'' metropolitan. Some telescoped forms can be shorter than the original classical compounds: ''gynie'' is shorter than ''gyneco-'' and stands for both ''gynecology'' and ''gynecologist''; ''anthro'' is shorter than ''anthropo-'' and stands for ''anthropology''.

Suffixes include: ''-ectomy'' cutting out, ''-graphy'' writing, description, ''-kinesis'' motion, ''-logy'' study, ''-mancy'' divination, ''-onym'' name, ''-phagy'' eating, ''-phony'' sound, ''-therapy'' healing, ''-tomy'' cutting. They are generally listed in dictionaries without the interfixed vowel, which appears however in such casual phrases as ‘ologies and isms’.

===Variants===
Some classical compounds are variants of one base.

Some are also free words, such as ''mania'' in ''dipsomania'' and ''phobia'' in ''claustrophobia''.

Some are composites of other elements, such as ''encephalo-'' brain, from ''en-'' in, ''-cephal-'' head; and ''-ectomy'' cutting out, from ''ec-'' out, ''-tom-'' cut, ''-y'', a noun-forming suffix that means "process of".

===Formation===
In Greek and Latin grammar, combining bases usually require a thematic or stem-forming vowel. In ''biography'', from Greek, the thematic is -''o''-; in ''agriculture'', from Latin, it is ''-i-''. In English morphology, this vowel can be considered as an [[interfix]]: ''[[wikt:-o-#Interfix|-o-]]'', in ''miniskirt'', the interfix ''[[wikt:-i-#Interfix|-i-]]''. It is usually regarded as attached to the initial base (''bio-'', ''mini-'') rather than the final base (''-graphy'', ''-skirt''), but in forms where it is conventionally [[stress and vowel reduction in English|stressed]], it is sometimes considered as part of the final base (''-ography'', ''-ology''). If the final element begins with a vowel (for example, ''-archy'' as in ''monarchy''), the mediating vowel has traditionally been avoided (not *''monoarchy''), but in recent coinages it is often kept, sometimes accompanied by a hyphen (''auto-analysis'', ''[[bioenergy]]'', ''[[hydroelectricity]]'', not *''autanalysis'', *''bienergy'', *''hydrelectricity'').

Its presence helps to distinguish classical compounds like ''biography'' and ''agriculture'' from vernacular compounds like ''teapot'' and ''blackbird''.

===Origin===

Generally, English has acquired its classical compounds in three ways: through French from Latin and Greek, directly from Latin and Greek, and by coinage in English on Greek and Latin patterns. An exception is ''schizophrenia'', which came into English through German, and is therefore pronounced ‘skitso’, not ‘skyzo’.

==The conservative tradition==
From the [[Renaissance]] until the mid-20th century, the concept of derivational purity has generally regulated the use of classical compounds: Greek with Greek, Latin with Latin, and a minimum of hybridization. ''Biography'' is Greek, ''agriculture'' Latin, but ''television'' is a hybrid of Greek ''tele-'' and Latin ''-vision'' (probably so coined because the ‘pure’ form ''telescope'' had already been adopted for another purpose). Most dictionaries follow the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in using ''combining form'' (''comb. form'') to label such classical elements, but the name is not widely known. In appendices to dictionaries and grammar books, classical compounds are often loosely referred to as roots or affixes: ‘a logo …, properly speaking, is not a word at all but a prefix meaning word and short for logogram, a symbol, much as telly is short for television’ (Montreal ''Gazette'', 13  Apr.  1981). They are often referred to as affixes because some come first and some come last, but if they were affixes, a word like ''biography'' would have no base whatever. While affixes are grammatical (like prepositions), classical compounds are [[lexicon|lexical]] (like nouns, adjectives, and verbs): for example, ''bio-'' translates as a noun (life), ''-graphy'' as a verbal noun (writing). They are also often loosely called roots because they are ancient and have a basic role in word formation, but functionally and often structurally they are distinct from roots: the ''-graph'' in ''autograph'' is both a root and a classical compound, while the ''-graphy'' in ''cryptography'' consists of root ''-graph-'' and suffix ''-y'', and is only a classical compound.

===Contemporary developments===
Generally, classical compounds were a closed system from the 16th century to the earlier 20th century: the people who used them were [[Classics|classically educated]], their teachers and exemplars generally took a purist's view on their use, contexts of use were mainly technical, and there was relatively little seepage into the language at large. However, with the decline of classical education and the spread of technical and quasitechnical jargon in the media, a continuum has evolved, with at least five stages:

====Pure classical usage====
In the older sciences, classical compounds are generally used to form such strictly classical and usually Greek compounds as ''anthocyanin'', ''astrobleme'', ''chemotherapy'', ''chronobiology'', ''cytokinesis'', ''glossolalia'', ''lalophobia'', ''narcolepsy'', ''osteoporosis'', ''Pliohippus'', ''sympathomimetic''.

====Hybrid classical usage====
In technical, semitechnical, and quasitechnical usage at large, coiners of compounds increasingly treat Latin and Greek as one resource to produce such forms as ''accelerometer'', ''aero-generator'', ''bioprospector'', ''communicology'', ''electroconductive'', ''futurology'', ''mammography'', ''micro-gravity'', ''neoliberal'', ''Scientology'', ''servomechanism''.

====Hybrid classical/vernacular usage====
In the later 20th century, many forms have cut loose from ancient moorings: ''crypto-'' as in preposed ''Crypto-Fascist'' and ''pseudo-'' as in ''pseudoradical''; postposed ''-meter'' in ''speedometer'', ''clapometer''. Processes of analogy have created coinages like ''petrodollar'', ''psycho-warfare'', ''microwave'' on such models as ''petrochemical'', ''psychology'', ''microscope''. Such stunt usages as ''eco-doom'', ''eco-fears'', ''eco-freaks'', common in journalism, often employ classical compounds telescopically: ''eco-'' standing for ''ecology'' and ''ecological'' and not as used in ''economics''. In such matters, precision of meaning is secondary to compactness and vividness of expression.

====Combining forms as separate words====
In recent years, the orthography of many word forms has changed, usually without affecting pronunciation and stress. The same spoken usage may be written ''micro-missile'', ''micro missile'', ''micromissile'', reflecting the same uncertainty or flexibility as in ''businessman'', ''business-man'', ''business man''. When used in such ways, classical compounds are often telescopic: ''Hydro substation'' Hydro-Electricity Board substation, ''Metro highways'' Metropolitan highways, ''porno cult'' pornography cult.

====New classical compounds====
The mix of late 20c techno-commercial coinages includes three groups of post- and non-classical forms: '''(1)''' ''Established forms'': ''econo-'' from ‘economic’, as in ''econometric'', ''Econo-Car'', ''mini-'' from ‘miniature’, as in ''miniskirt'', ''mini-boom'', ''-matic'' from ‘automatic’, as in ''Adjustamatic'', ''[[Instamatic]]'', ''Stackomatic''. '''(2)''' Less established forms, often created by blending: ''accu-'' from ‘accurate’, as in ''[[Accuvision]]''; ''compu-'' from ‘computer’, as in ''Compucorp''; ''docu-'' from ‘documentary’, as in ''docudrama''; ''perma-'' from ‘permanent’, as in ''permafrost'' and ''permaban''; ''dura-'' from ‘durable’, as in ''Duramark''. '''(3)''' Informal vernacular material in pseudo-classical form: ''[[Easibird]]'', ''[[Healthitone]]'', ''[[Redi-pak]]'', ''[[Relax-A-Cizor]]'' (relax, exerciser).

====Binational forms====
Word forms exist for describing relations or interactions between two nations or societies, such as "Anglo-French" (England and France), Franco-Italian (France and Italy), Greco-Turkish (Greece and Turkey), Russo-Japanese (Russia and Japan), Sino-Cambodian (China and Cambodian), Americo-Liberian (the United States and the African nation of Liberia). In theory, at least, word forms exist to describe every conceivable pairing, although some (Peruvo-Ugandan? Papuo-Icelandic?) may tend more to the fabulous than the actually useful forms. Note that it could be argued that Franco-English, Italo-French, Turco-Grecian, and so forth are equally valid ways of describing the relationship or interactions. The term Afro-American was formerly used to describe a Black American, but now it is deemed more politically correct not to use the Afro- combining form and instead, the term African American is used.

== Similar systems ==
In East Asia, a similar role to Latin and Greek has been played by Chinese, with non-Chinese languages both borrowing a significant number of words from Chinese and using morphemes borrowed from Chinese to coin new words, particularly in formal or technical language. See [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]], [[Sino-Korean vocabulary]], and [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] for discussion.

The coinage of new native terms on Chinese roots is most notable in Japanese, where it is referred to as {{Nihongo||和製漢語|[[wasei kango]]|Japanese-made Chinese-words}}. Many of these have been subsequently borrowed into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese, with the same (or corresponding) characters being pronounced differently according to language, just as happens in European languages – compare English ''[[wikt:biology#English|biology]]'' and French ''[[wikt:biologie#French|biologie]].''

For example, 自動車 (Japanese ''jidōsha,'' Korean ''jadongcha'') is a Japanese-coined word meaning “automobile”, literally self-move-car; compare to ''auto'' (self) + ''mobile'' (moving).

History of '''coinage of the Pontic Kingdom''' probably began during reign of [[Mithridates II of Pontus|Mithridates II]] of the [[Kingdom of Pontus]]. Early Pontic coinage imitated coinage with [[Alexander the Great]]'s portraits. Later coinage is well known for its high decree of realism in portraits of the Pontic kings who were proud of their [[Iran]]ian ancestry. Pontic coin portraitry developed isolated from wider [[Hellenistic]] tradition. However, [[Mithridates V]] and his son [[Mithridates VI]] partially abandoned oriental influences in the coin portraitry.

Pontic mints experimented with new materials for coinage. Pure copper and [[brass]] were used in mints during reign of Mithridates VI. His brass coinage are the earliest known coins made from brass. His rule and wars resulted in a wide expansion in number of mints and struck coinage. Earlier Pontic coinage attributable to prior rulers is very rare.

Pontic coinage managed to gain a wide acceptance within eastern Mediterranean region.

==Evolution of Pontic coinage==

It is likely that the first coinage was struck during [[Mithridates II of Pontus|Mithridates II]]'s reign. His reign is assumed to have lasted from 255 BC to 220 BC. The first Pontic coinage mimicked other coinage with [[Alexander the Great]]'s image on them.&lt;ref name="LawrenceUniversity"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.lawrence.edu/dept/art/BUERGER/CATALOGUE/046.HTML|title=(46) Pontos, Mithradates III|website=www2.lawrence.edu|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"/&gt; [[Mithridates III of Pontus|Mithridates III]] had issued substantial amount of silver coinage by the end of his reign.

Before [[Mithridates VI]] Pontic coinage is very rare. This has complicated studies of royal Pontic coinage.&lt;ref name="Callatay"&gt;{{cite web|last=de Callataÿ|first=François|url=http://mithridat-eupator.ru/biblioteka/Mithridates_VI_and_the_Pontic_Kingdom_Hojte_2009.pdf|title=The First Royal Coinages of Pontos (from Mithridates III to Mithridates V)|pages=63–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chronology of the Pontic coinage is well known from research.&lt;ref name="Erciyas2006"/&gt; For instance, Mithridates VI dated most of his coins by the [[Bithynian era |Bithynian year]] and by month.&lt;ref name="Metcalf2016"/&gt;

There was a distinction between royal and city coinage. Royal coinage was struck on gold and silver. They also had king's image and name on them. Coinage produced by cities were made from bronze and had name of the city on reverse side of the coin.&lt;ref name="Erciyas2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deniz Burcu Erciyas|title=Wealth, Aristocracy And Royal Propaganda Under the Hellenistic Kingdom of the Mithradatids in the Central Black Sea Region of Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ghdXySx1JvwC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2006|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-14609-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coinage struck autonomously by cities was discontinued for a time, as the cities lost their autonomy under reign of [[Pharnakes I]]. Mithridates VI restored privilege of cities to have their own coinage, but he retained some control, as can be deducted from standardization of local coinage.&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;

Pontic coinage has very fine portraits of their kings. Only [[Greco-Bactria]]n coinage is minted in such a realistic detail. Greek engravers were hired to carve [[coin die]]s used in the minting process. Pontic ruling dynasty was very proud of its [[Iran]]ian descent, and the portraits clearly show their oriental features. Mithridates III struck a coin with a [[Zeus]] holding an eagle on one side, and the other side portrayed himself as a non-idealized bearded old man with a short hair. It was customary to have more realistic coin portraits in the east.&lt;ref name="LawrenceUniversity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt; However, the Pontic dynasty had married early in the [[Seleucid]] royal line.&lt;ref name="LawrenceUniversity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt; The Pontic Kingdom remained stubbornly resistant to foreign influence.&lt;ref name="LawrenceUniversity"/&gt; Despite the ruling dynasty's Iranian origins, the Pontic state is considered to be a Hellenistic state.&lt;ref name="Christodoulou"&gt;{{cite web|last=Christodoulou|first=Stavros|url=https://www.imxa.gr/bsfiles/50/1.Christodoulou-web.pdf|title=The Pontic Kingdom Under Mithridates VI|access-date=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the population was also ethnically Iranian.&lt;ref name="LawrenceUniversity"/&gt;

Pontic portraiture developed outside the typical [[Hellenistic]] art.&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"/&gt; [[Mithridates V]] was the first king who had a relatively idealized portraiture about himself in coinage. The trend was further developed by his son Mithridates VI. The trend may have started from wishes of Mithridates V to show his Greek side more than his oriental background.&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;

Late Hellenistic Pontic coinage have been found around the [[Mediterranean]]. This may indicate mobility of people and goods from the period contemporary with the Pontic kingdom. Pontic coinage has been found from same coin hoards together with other Hellenistic coinage. Such hoards have been found from the Near East and in south-eastern Anatolia. It is likely that Pontic coins were widely accepted in the eastern Mediterranean region.&lt;ref name="Erciyas2006"/&gt; The [[Kingdom of Bosporus]] was governed after its conquest by a son of Mithridates VI. Pontic coinage has been found from northern shores of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name="Gavrilov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gavrilov|first=Alexander V.|url=http://mithridat-eupator.ru/biblioteka/Mithridates_VI_and_the_Pontic_Kingdom_Hojte_2009.pdf|title=Coin Finds from the Kuru Baš Fortified Settlement and Some Questions Concerning the History of Theodosia in the Late 2nd and 1st Centuries BC|pages=329–352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coinage during Mithridates VI's reign==

{{Further|Mithridates VI}}

It has been suggested that [[Mithridates VI]]'s policy allowed more isolated cities of the kingdom from central [[Black Sea]] region to profit. His goal may have been to bring a sense of unity to these cities.&lt;ref name="Erciyas2006"/&gt; He allowed the most important cities to have their own copper coinage. [[Amaseia]] became exceptionally, for a brief period of time, the only Pontic city allowed to strike its own silver and gold coinage. Mithridates VI allowed this as a reward for the city's service for him. He also encouraged mints managed by temples.&lt;ref name="Christodoulou"/&gt;

Mithridates VI imitated Alexander the Great in coin portraits.&lt;ref name="Christodoulou"/&gt; His coin portraits portray him as a young man with a flowing hair, long sideburns, a prominent nose and a narrow forehead. His hair and eyes are in a style similar with portrayals of Alexander. His coinage shows the late Pontic style that abandoned oriental tradition of non-idealized portrayals of kings. The new style is closer of common Hellenistic coinage.&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;

The most common image in his coinage, in various denominations, was a grazing animal together with a star and a crescent. Ivy leaves and grapes were also included to the scene. [[Pegasi]] and [[stag]]s are two animals appearing in his coins. It has been suggested that after the Kingdom of Pontus expanded westward under his reign, the pegasus was abandoned and coins with a stag started to appear. This change would have been politically motivated as the pegasus would have been too closely associated with Persia. Mithridates VI did include in certain coins scenes about the myth of [[Perseus]] to emphasize his dual ancestry between Greece and Persia. [[Appian]] claimed that Perseus was an ancestor of Alexander the Great, while [[Herodotus]] thought Perseus as a Persian.&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;

The [[First Mithridatic War|First]] and [[Second Mithridatic War|Second]] Mithridatic Wars were preceded with heavy minting. However, after the second war all minting ceased.&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt; During the wars between [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and Pontus Mithridates VI funded his military campaigns by introducing new materials for coinage. Copper and brass coinage appeared as new financial sources for the Pontic state. Romans later exploited, during monetary reforms of [[Augustus]] in 23 BC, the wide circulation of these new forms of currency.&lt;ref name="Christodoulou"/&gt; Both materials are useful for overvalued coinage. Pure copper coinage may have been meant to partly substitute silver coinage. It is also possible that copper coins were meant for use in the region of Cimmerian Bosporus.&lt;ref name="Smekalova"/&gt;

==Brass coinage==
[[Brass]] is an [[alloy]] that was used relatively rarely in ancient times. [[Phrygia]] is the only region with a recorded regular use of brass from antique. Previously it was thought that [[Roman coinage|Roman]]s were the first to make brass coinage. Specimens contemporary with [[Julius Caesar]] and Augustus are known. Research conducted in 1970s revealed that brass was used half a century earlier than previously thought. Phrygia and [[Bithynia]] are known sources for Pontic brass coinage.&lt;ref name="Smekalova"/&gt; Pontic brass coins were struck durign reign of Mithridates VI,&lt;ref name="Smekalova"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smekalova|first=Tat'jana N.|url=http://mithridat-eupator.ru/biblioteka/Mithridates_VI_and_the_Pontic_Kingdom_Hojte_2009.pdf|title=The Earliest Application of Brass and "Pure" Copper in the Hellenistic Coinages of Asia Minor and the Northern Black Sea Coast|pages=233–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he can be regarded as the first ruler to make use of brass. Modern analyzes have revealed that some of his bronze coins are in fact made from brass.&lt;ref name="Metcalf2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=William E. Metcalf|title=The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Coinage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trkUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA187|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-937218-8|pages=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study that analyzed Pontic and [[Celts|Celtic]] brass coins found out that [[selenium]] is an important impurity as it can be used to track down ore sources from the eastern parts of the classical world. Use of brass gradually spread towards west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Šmit|first=Žiga|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/00800/00846/00042/pdf/EPA00846_archeometriai_muhely_2015_04_255-262.pdf|title=Metal Analysis With Ion-Beam Methods|journal=Archeometriai Műhely|volume=XII|issue=4|publisher=University of Ljubljana|page=257|ISSN=1786-271X|date=2015|access-date=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mints==
There were mints in cities of [[Amisos]], [[Pharnaceia]], [[Trabzon|Trapezus]] and [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]]e. At the time of Mithridates VI amount of cities minting coins drastically increased. Cities such as [[Amaseia]], [[Abonutheichos]], [[Cabeira]], [[Chabakta]], [[Comana Pontica|Comana]], [[Gaziura]],  Laodikeia and [[Taulara]]. Only Gaziura had minted coins in the past out of these cities.&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20746">[[File:Beakerculture.jpg|thumb|Items from the Neolithic "[[Beaker culture]]"; the idea of defining distinct "cultures" according to their material culture was at the core of culture-historical archaeology.]]
'''Culture-historical archaeology''' is an [[archaeological theory]] that emphasises defining historical societies into distinct ethnic and cultural groupings according to their [[material culture]].

It originated in the late nineteenth century as [[cultural evolutionism]] began to fall out of favor with many [[antiquarianism|antiquarians]] and archaeologists. It was gradually superseded in the mid-twentieth century by [[processual archaeology]]. Cultural-historical archaeology had in many cases been influenced by a [[nationalism|nationalist]] political agenda, being utilised to prove a direct cultural and/or ethnic link from prehistoric and ancient peoples to modern nation-states, something that has in many respects been disproved by later research and archaeological evidence.

First developing in Germany among those archaeologists surrounding [[Rudolf Virchow]], culture-historical ideas would later be popularised by [[Gustaf Kossinna]]. Culture-historical thought would be introduced to British archaeology by [[V. Gordon Childe]] in the late 1920s. In the United Kingdom and United States, culture-history came to be supplanted as the dominant theoretical paradigm in archaeology during the 1960s, with the rise of [[processual archaeology]]. Nevertheless, elsewhere in the world, culture-historical ideas continue to dominate.

== Background ==
Webster remarked that the defining feature of culture-historical archaeology was its "statements which reveal common notions about the nature of ancient cultures; about their qualities; about how they related to the material record; and thus about how archaeologists might effectively study them."&lt;ref name="webster 12"&gt;[[#Web08|Webster 2008]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Webster noted that the second defining feature of culture-historical thought was its emphasis on classification and typologies.&lt;ref name="webster 13"&gt;[[#Web08|Webster 2008]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Culture-historical archaeology arose during a somewhat tumultuous time in European intellectual thought. The [[Industrial Revolution]] had spread across many nations, leading to the creation of large [[city|urban]] centres, most of which were filled with poverty stricken [[proletariat]] workers. This new urban working class had begun to develop a political voice through [[socialism]], threatening the established political orders of many European states. Whilst some intellectuals had championed the Industrial Revolution as a progressive step forward, there were many who had seen it as a negative turn of events, disrupting the established fabric of society. This latter view was taken up by the [[Romanticism|Romanticist movement]], which was largely made up of artists and writers, who popularised the idea of an idyllic ancient agrarian society.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 217"&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a trend that was developing among the European intelligentsia that began to oppose the concept of [[cultural evolutionism]] (that culture and society gradually evolved and progressed through stages), instead taking the viewpoint that human beings were inherently resistant to change.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographic variability and the concept of "culture"===
Historian of archaeology [[Bruce Trigger]] considered the development of culture-historical archaeology to be "a response to growing awareness of geographical variability in the archaeological record" at a time when the belief in cultural evolutionary archaeology was declining in western and central Europe.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007. p. 211"&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 19th century, an increasing amount of archaeological material had been collected in Europe, in part as a result of land reclamation projects, increased agricultural production and construction, the foundation of museums and establishment of archaeological teaching positions at universities. As a result of this, archaeologists had come to increasingly realise that there was a great deal of variability in the artefacts uncovered across the continent. Many felt that this variability was not comfortably explained by preexisting evolutionary paradigms.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 215"&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture-historical archaeology adopted the concept of "culture" from anthropology, where cultural evolutionary ideas had also begun to be criticised. In the late 19th century, anthropologists like [[Franz Boas]] and [[Friedrich Ratzel]] were promoting the idea that cultures represented geographically distinct entities, each with their own characteristics that had developed largely through the chance accumulation of different traits. Similar ideas were also coming from Germany's neighbour, Austria, at around this time, namely from two anthropologist Roman Catholic priests, [[Fritz Graebner]] and [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]], as well as by the archaeologist [[Oswald Menghin]].&lt;ref name="webster 12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 218&amp;ndash;219.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism and racialism===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|The rise of European nationalism in the 19th century would play a key role in the development of culture-historical archaeology.]]
Bruce Trigger also argued that the development of culture-historical archaeology was in part due to the rising tide of [[nationalism]] and [[racism]] in Europe, which emphasised [[ethnicity]] as the main factor shaping history. Such nationalistic sentiment began to be adopted within academic disciplines by intellectuals who wished to emphasise solidarity within their own nations &amp;ndash; in the face of social unrest caused by industrialization &amp;ndash; by blaming neighbouring states.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007. p. 211"/&gt; Under such a nationalist worldview, people across Europe came to see different nationalities &amp;ndash; such as the French, Germans and English &amp;ndash; as being biologically different from one another, and it was argued that their behaviour was determined by these racial differences as opposed to  social or economic factors.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 217"/&gt;

Having been inspired and influenced by European nationalism, in turn, culture-historical archaeology would be utilised in support of nationalist political causes. In many cases, nationalists used culture-historical archaeological interpretations to highlight and celebrate the prehistoric and ancient past of their ancestors, and prove an ethnic and cultural link to them. As such, many members of various European nations placed an emphasis on archaeologically proving a connection with a particular historical ethnicity, for instance the [[French people|French]] often maintained that they were the ethnic and cultural descendents of the ancient [[Gauls]], whilst the [[England|English]] did the same with the [[Anglo-Saxons]] and the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] with the [[Celts]], and archaeologists in these countries were encouraged to interpret the archaeological evidence to fit these conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 212&amp;ndash;215.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable examples of a nationalist movement utilising culture-historical archaeology was that of the [[Nazi Party]], who obtained power in Germany in 1933 and established a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime that emphasised the alleged racial supremacy of the German race and sought to unify all German speakers under a single political state. The Nazis were influenced by the culture-historical ideas of Kossinna, and used archaeology to support their claims regarding the behaviour of prehistoric Germans, in turn supporting their own policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 240&amp;ndash;241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early development: 1869&amp;ndash;1925===
Culture-historical archaeology first developed in Germany in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 235"&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, the German Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistoric Archaeology (''Urgeschichte'') had been founded, an organisation that was dominated by the figure of [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821&amp;ndash;1902), a pathologist and leftist politician. He advocated the union of prehistoric archaeology with [[cultural anthropology]] and ethnology into a singular prehistoric anthropology which would identify prehistoric cultures from the material record and try to connect them to later ethnic groups who were recorded in the written, historical record.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 235"/&gt; Although the archaeological work undertaken by Virchow and his fellows was cultural-historical in basis, it did not initially gain a significant following in the country's archaeological community, the majority of whom remained devoted to the dominant cultural evolutionary trend.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 235"/&gt;

{{double image|left|Rudolf Virchow NLM3.jpg|165|Gustaf Kossinna by Bruno-Dietrich Sassnick.jpg|150|The German archaeologists Rudolf Virchow (left) and Gustaf Kossinna (right) were the founding fathers of culture-historical archaeology.}}

In 1895, a librarian who was fascinated by German prehistory, [[Gustaf Kossinna]] (1858&amp;ndash;1931), presented a lecture in which he tried to connect the tribes who had been recorded as living between the [[Rhine]] and [[Vistula]] in 100 BCE with cultures living in that region during the Neolithic.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 235-6"&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 235&amp;ndash;236.&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed Professor of Archaeology at the [[University of Berlin]], in 1909 he founded the German Society for Prehistory (''Vorgeschichte''). He would proceed to further publicise his culture-historical approach in his subsequent books, ''Die Herkunft der Germanen'' (''The Origin of the Germans''), which was published in 1911, and the two-volume ''Ursprung und Verbreitung der Germanen'' (''Origin and Expansion of the Germans''), which was published between 1926 and 1927.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 236"&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; A staunch nationalist and racist, Kossinna lambasted fellow German archaeologists for taking an interest in non-German societies, such as those of Egypt and the Classical World, and used his publications to support his views on [[German nationalism]]. Glorifying the German peoples of prehistory, he used an explicitly culture-historical approach in understanding them, and proclaimed that these German peoples were racially superior to their Slavic neighbours to the east.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 236"/&gt;

Believing that an individual's ethnicity determined their behaviour, the core of Kossinna's approach was to divide Temperate Europe into three large cultural groupings: Germans, Celts and Slavs, based upon the modern linguistic groups. He then divided each of these cultural groupings into smaller "cultures", or tribes, for instance dividing the Germans up into [[Saxons]], [[Vandals]], [[Lombards]] and [[Burgundians]].&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 237"&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that each of these groups had its own distinctive traditions which were present in their material culture, and that by mapping out the material culture in the archaeological record, he could trace the movement and migration of different ethnic groups, a process he called ''siedlungsarchäologie'' (''[[settlement archaeology]]'').&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 237"/&gt; Much of Kossinna's work was criticised by other German archaeologists, but nevertheless his basic culture-historical manner of interpreting the past still came to dominance in the country's archaeological community; Trigger noted that his work "marked the final replacement of an evolutionary approach to prehistory by a culture-historical one" and that for that, he must be viewed as an "innovator" whose work was "of very great importance".&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 239-40"&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 239&amp;ndash;240.&lt;/ref&gt;

As it became the dominant archaeological theory within the discipline, a number of prominent cultural-historical archaeologists rose to levels of influence. The Swedish archaeologist [[Oscar Montelius]] was one of the most notable, as he studied the entirety of the European archaeological prehistoric record, and divided it into a number of distinct temporal groups based upon grouping together various forms of artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 224-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain and the U.S.===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|align=right|quote="We find certain types of remains – pots, implements, ornaments, burial rites, house forms – constantly recurring together. Such a complex of regularly associated traits we shall term a 'cultural group' or just a 'culture'.

Culture-historical archaeology was first introduced into British scholarship from continental Europe by an Australian prehistorian, [[V. Gordon Childe]]. A keen linguist, Childe was able to master a number of European languages, including German, and was well acquainted with the works on archaeological cultures written by Kossina. Having moved to the United Kingdom to escape political persecution in Australia, Childe took up a position as the Abercrombie Professor of Archaeology at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1927. This was followed by ''The Danube in Prehistory'' (1929), in which Childe examined the archaeology along the [[Danube]] river, recognising it as the natural boundary dividing the Near East from Europe, and subsequently he believed that it was via the Danube that various new technologies travelled westward in antiquity. In ''The Danube in Prehistory'', Childe introduced the concept of an [[archaeological culture]] (which up until then had been largely restrained purely to German academics), to his British counterparts. This concept would revolutionise the way in which archaeologists understood the past, and would come to be widely accepted in future decades.&lt;ref name="Trigger 1980 56-60"&gt;[[#Tri80|Trigger 1980]]. pp. 56&amp;ndash;60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre81|Green 1981]]. pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;
In behalf of this..

== Concepts ==

=== Distinct historical cultures ===
The core point to culture-historical archaeology was its belief that the human species could be subdivided into various "[[cultures]]" that were in many cases distinct from one another. Usually, each of these cultures was seen as representing a different [[ethnicity]]. From an archaeological perspective, it was believed that each of these cultures could be distinguished because of its [[material culture]], such as the style of pottery that it produced or the forms of burial that it practiced.

A number of culture-historical archaeologists subdivided and named separate cultures within their field of expertise:  for instance, archaeologists working in the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]], in examining the [[Bronze Age]] period, divided it up between such cultures as [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]], [[Helladic period|Helladic]] and [[Cycladic culture|Cycladic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diffusion and migration ===

Within culture-historical archaeology, changes in the culture of a historical society were typically explained by the diffusion of ideas from one culture into another, or by the migration of members of one society into a new area, sometimes by invasion. This was at odds with the theories held by cultural evolutionary archaeologists, who whilst accepting diffusion and migration as reasons for cultural change, also accepted the concept that independent cultural development could occur within a society, which was something culture-historical archaeologists typically refused to accept.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 217"/&gt;

A number of culture-historical archaeologists put forward the idea that all knowledge and technology in the ancient world had diffused from a single source in the [[Middle East]], which had then been spread across much of  the world by merchants. The Australian [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] for instance, in his works ''The Children of the Sun'' (1923) and ''The Growth of Civilisation'' (1924), put forward the idea that agriculture, architecture, religion and government had all developed in [[Ancient Egypt]], where the conditions were perfect for the development of such things, and that these ideas were then diffused into other cultures. A similar theory was proposed by [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] in 1939, but he believed [[Mesopotamia]] to be the source rather than Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inductive reasoning ===

Culture history uses [[inductive reasoning]] unlike its main rival, [[processual archaeology]] which stresses the importance of the [[Hypothetico-deductive model|hypothetico-deduction]] method. To work best it requires a historical record to support it. As much of early archaeology focused on the [[Classical World]] it naturally came to rely on and mirror the information provided by ancient historians who could already explain many of the events and motivations which would not necessarily survive in the archaeological record. The need to explain prehistoric societies, without this historical record, could initially be dealt with using the paradigms established for later periods but as more and more material was excavated and studied, it became clear that culture history could not explain it all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Manufacturing techniques and economic behaviour can be easily explained through cultures and culture history approaches but more complex events and explanations, involving less concrete examples in the material record are harder for it to explain. In order to interpret prehistoric religious beliefs for example, an approach based on cultures provides little to go on. Culture historians could catalogue items but in order to look beyond the material record, towards anthropology and the scientific method, they would have had to abandon their reliance on material, 'inhuman,' cultures.
Such approaches were the intent of [[processual archaeology]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Culture history is by no means useless or surpassed by more effective methods of thinking. Indeed, diffusionist explanations are still valid in many cases and the importance of describing and classifying finds has not gone away. [[post-processual archaeology|Post-processual archaeologists]] stress the importance of recurring patterns in material culture, echoing culture history's approach. In many cases it can be argued that any explanation is only one factor within a whole network of influences.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Criticism ==
Another criticism of this particular archaeological theory was that it often placed an emphasis on studying peoples from the [[Neolithic]] and later ages, somewhat ignoring the earliest human era, the [[Palaeolithic]], where distinct cultural groups and differences are less noticeable in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="Trigger 2007 215"/&gt;

King, “In Memoriam: Donald Routledge Hill (1922-1994)”, ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy,'' Volume 5 / Issue 02 / September 1995, pp 297-302&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[engineer]] and [[History of science and technology|historian of science and technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill Donald(1993)&lt;/ref&gt; especially known for his translation of ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'' of the Muslim engineer [[Ismail al-Jazari]].

== Life and work ==
Born in London, after secondary school Hill served in the English army in the [[Royal Engineers]] from 1941 to 1946. Two years he served in the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] in North Africa until he was wounded in action in Italy. Back in England he studied Engineering at the London University, obtaining his engineering degree in 1949. In 1964 he obtained his M.Litt in Islamic History at the University of Durham, and in 1970 his PhD from the University of London.&lt;ref name="DAK 1995"/&gt;

Late 1940s Hill started his career working for the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] in Lebanon, Syria and Qatar. Back in England he worked for several petrochemical companies until his retirement in 1984.&lt;ref name="DAK 1995"/&gt;

It is one of the most prominent [[tourist destination]]s in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], a [[Port|seaport]] and the centre of [[Dubrovnik-Neretva County]]. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage site]]s.

The prosperity of the city was historically based on [[trade|maritime trade]]; as the capital of the maritime [[Republic of Ragusa]], it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled [[diplomacy]].

In 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was [[Siege of Dubrovnik|besieged]] by [[Serbia]]n and [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] soldiers of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1196879.stm|title=Charges over Dubrovnik bombing|last=Wood|first=Paul|date=2 March 2001|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justdubrovnik.com/2013/10/anniversary-of-attack-on-dubrovnik/5624/|title=Anniversary Of Attack On Dubrovnik  – Just Dubrovnik|author=|date=1 October 2013|work=justdubrovnik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.Anzulovic: Heavenly Serbia: From Myth to Genocide, NYU Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.

One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/news/has-dubrovnik-solved-over-crowding-from-cruise-lines/|title=Has Dubrovnik solved the problem of overcrowding from cruise ships?|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
The names ''Dubrovnik'' and ''Ragusa'' co-existed for several centuries. ''Ragusa'', recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century, remained the official name of the [[Republic of Ragusa]] until 1808, and of the city within the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] until 1918, while ''Dubrovnik'', first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Oleh Havrylyshyn, Nora Srzentiæ, ''Institutions Always 'Mattered': Explaining Prosperity in Mediaeval Ragusa (Dubrovnik)'', Palgrave Macmillan, 10 Dec 2014, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-WSpBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 p. 59]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Dubrovnik'' of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the [[Charter of Ban Kulin]] (1189).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://leksikon.muzej-marindrzic.eu/bosna/ | title=Bosna | work=Leksikon Marina Držića | year=2017 | publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography]] and House of Marin Drzic | language=hr | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mostly explained as "dubron", a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name for water ([[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] dubron, [[Irish language|Irish]] dobar, [[Welsh language|Welsh]] dubr/dwfr, [[Cornish language|Cornish]] dofer), akin to the [[toponym]]s [[Douvres]], [[Dover]], and [[Tauber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor=[[August Fick]] | author1=[[Whitley Stokes]] | author2=[[Adalbert Bezzenberger]] | title=Vergleichendes Wörterbuch der indogermanischen Sprachen: Wortschatz der Keltischen Spracheinheit | volume=2 | entry=dubron | edition=4th | year=1894 | publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht | pages=153–154 | url=https://archive.org/details/vergleichendeswr02fick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical name ''Ragusa'' is recorded in the Greek form Ῥαούσιν (''Rhaousin'', Latinized ''{{lang|la|Ragusium}}'') in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period,  ''Rausia, Lavusa, Labusa, Raugia, Rachusa''. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek ῥάξ, ῥαγός "grape"; from Greek ῥώξ, ῥωγός "narrow passage"; Greek ῥωγάς  "ragged (of rocks)", ῥαγή (ῥαγάς) "fissure"; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the ''Rhogoi'', from an unidentified [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] substrate. A connection to the name of [[Ragusa, Italy|Sicilian Ragusa]] has also been proposed. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek ([[Pelasgians#Language|"Pelasgian"]]), from a root cognate to Greek ῥαγή "fissure", with a suffix ''-ussa'' also found in the Greek name of [[Brač]], ''Elaphousa''.&lt;ref name=Putanec&gt;{{cite journal|first=Valentin|last=Putanec|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/69329|title=Naziv Labusedum iz 11. st. za grad Dubrovnik|journal=Rasprave|publisher=[[Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics]]|date=June 1993|volume=19|language=hr|pages=289–301|format=PDF|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical explanation of the name is due to [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]]'s ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa (Ῥαούσιν) is the foundation of the refugees from  [[Epidaurum]] ([[Ragusa Vecchia]]), a Greek city situated some {{cvt|15|km|0}} to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of ''Lausa'', the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek λᾶας "rock, stone").

==History==

===Origins===
According to [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]]'s  ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' ({{circa}} 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a "rocky island" called ''Lausa'', by refugees from [[Epidaurum]] ([[Ragusa Vecchia]]), a Greek city situated some 15&amp;nbsp;km to the south, when that city was destroyed in the [[Sclaveni#7th century|Slavic incursions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_NBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA218 |title=Researches on the Danube and the Adriatic; or Contributions to the Modern History of Hungary and Transylvania, Dalmatia and Croatia, Servia and Bulgaria, Volume 1 |author=Andrew Archibald Paton |year=1862 |publisher=Trübner and Co. |location=London |chapter=Chapter 9: Ragusa |page=218 |accessdate=2016-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in 2007 revealed  a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] basilica from the 8th century and parts of the [[defensive wall|city walls]].
The size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.
There is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unidu.hr/datoteke/172izb/ZBORNIK.pdf ZBORNIK.indd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] (2009) {{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antun Ničetić, in his 1996 book ''{{lang|hr|Povijest dubrovačke luke}}'' ({{lang|en|"History of the Port of Dubrovnik"}}), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} as a station halfway between the two  Greek settlements of [[Budva]] and [[Korčula]], {{convert|95|nmi|km mi}} apart from each other.

Thus the city became Slavic-speaking city at the moment when her connection with the rest of Europe, specially Italy, brought her into the full corrent of the Western [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.pt/books?id=2VoQAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA416&amp;dq=serbia+dubrovnik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE5d3E7ubeAhUDuRoKHZ7wAGY4KBDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=serbia%20dubrovnik&amp;f=false Through Bosnia and the Herzegovina on Foot During the Insurrection] by Sir Arthur Evans, pages 416 and 417&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a [[free state (government)|free state]], although it was a vassal from 1382 to 1804 of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and paid an annual tribute to its sultan.&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher, Donald Edgar. ''An Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire'', Leiden: Brill, 1968, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its [[thalassocracy]] rivalled that of the [[Republic of Venice]] and other Italian maritime republics.

For centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of [[Ancona]], the other Adriatic [[maritime republic]] rival of Venice, which was itself the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a "Venetian Bay", also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice-[[Austria]]-[[Germany]]): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through [[Florence]] and ended in [[Flanders]] [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Repubbliche_marinare_-_fondachi_anconitani.png as seen on this map].

The Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272,  which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for [[Urban planning|town planning]] and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Naprijed, Naklada|location=Zagreb|title=The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide|page=354|date=July 1999|editor-last=Radovinovic|editor-first=Radovan|isbn=953-178-097-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first [[pharmacy]], still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An [[almshouse]] was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. [[Slave trading]] was abolished in 1418, and an [[orphanage]] opened in 1432. A {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} [[water supply network|water supply system]], instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.

The city was ruled by the local [[aristocracy]] which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two [[city council]]s. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of [[social class]]es. The republic abolished the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the [[Ottoman Empire]] for centuries.

The languages spoken by the people were the Romance Dalmatian and common Croatian. The latter started to replace Dalmatian little by little from the 11th century among the common inhabitants of the city. [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Venetian Language|Venetian]] would become important languages of culture and trade in Dubrovnik. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of [[Croatian literature]].

[[File:Onofrio's Fountain, Dubrovnik, Croatia.JPG|thumb|right|Big Onofrio's fountain (1438)]]
The economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of [[Cargo ship|merchant ships]] ([[wiktionary:argosy|argosy]]) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the {{lang-la|Libertas}} word  (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.

Many [[Marrano|Conversos]], Jews from Spain and [[Portugal]], were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time there worked in the city one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time: [[Ivan Rabljanin]] (Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). Already in 1571 Dubrovnik sold its protectorate over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and [[Venice]]. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in [[Fes]] in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a [[Cardinal protector]] in 1571. At that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors; those being France, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Savoy, Lucca, Greece, Illyria, Armenia and Lebanon.
[[File:Ragusa.png|thumb|left|Territory of the Republic before 1808]]

The Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] shipping crisis and the catastrophic [[1667 Dubrovnik earthquake|earthquake of 1667]]&lt;ref&gt;Husebye, Eystein Sverre. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwK4jhvjHQkC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=dubrovnik+earthquake+of+1667&amp;client=safari&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=dubrovnik%20earthquake%20of%201667&amp;f=false ''Earthquake Monitoring and Seismic Hazard Mitigation in Balkan Countries'']&lt;/ref&gt; which killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively impacted the whole [[Quality of life|well-being]] of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell [[Neum|two mainland patches of its territory]] to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is that country's only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik's diplomacy was the involvement in the [[Diplomacy in the American Revolutionary War#Ragusa|American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dubrovnik and the American Revolution: Francesco Favi's Letters,'' Francesco Favi, ed. by [[Wayne S. Vucinich]], Ragusan Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806, the city surrendered to the [[Grande Armée|Napoleonic army]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e8YJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=republic+of+ragusa+had+ceased+to+exist+DALMATIA+AND+MONTENEGRO+SIR+J.+GARDNER+WILKINSON&amp;client=safari&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Dalmatia and Montenegro: Volume 2]''.{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as that was the only way to end a month-long siege by the Russian-Montenegrin fleets (during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on the city). At first, [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] demanded only free passage for his troops, promising not to occupy the territory and stressing that the French were friends of Dubrovnik. Later, however, French forces blockaded the harbours, forcing the government to give in and let French troops enter the city. On this day, all flags and [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] above the city walls were painted black as a sign of mourning. In 1808, Marshal [[Auguste de Marmont]] abolished the republic and integrated its territory first into [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy]] and later into the [[Illyrian Provinces|Illyrian provinces]] under French rule. This was to last until 28 January 1814 when the city surrendered to Captain Sir [[William Hoste]] leading a body of British and Austrian troops who were [[Siege of Ragusa|besieging the fortress]].

===Languages===
The [[official language]] until 1472 was [[Latin]], though the common language was [[Serbian language|Serbian]].&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;[https://books.google.pt/books?id=2VoQAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA416&amp;dq=serbia+dubrovnik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE5d3E7ubeAhUDuRoKHZ7wAGY4KBDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=serbia%20dubrovnik&amp;f=false Through Bosnia and the Herzegovina on Foot During the Insurrection] by Sir Arthur Evans, page 416&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite her wealthy citizens speaking Serbian dialect of Dubrovnik in their family circles, they sent their children to Florentine schools to acquire perfect knowledge of Italian.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Later, the Senate of the Republic decided that the official language of the Republic would be the Dubrovnik dialect of the Romance [[Dalmatian language]], and forbade the use of the [[Croatian language]] in senatorial debate.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}{{fix|text=At least some sources say it was "Serbian".}} ''The Gospari'' (the Aristocracy) held on to their language for many centuries, but it slowly disappeared.

The [[Italian language]] as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the [[Venetian language]] and the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan dialect]]. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xoomer.virgilio.it/histria/storiaecultura/testiedocumenti/tesiscaglioni/tesi.htm |title=La presenza italiana in Dalmazia, 1866–1943 |year=1996 |work=Tesi di Laurea |publisher=Facoltà di Scienze politiche – Università degli studi di Milano |last=Marzio |first=Scaglioni |archivedate=2010-02-17 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nbG01IRn?url=http://xoomer.virgilio.it/histria/storiaecultura/testiedocumenti/tesiscaglioni/tesi.htm |accessdate=2010-02-17 |language=it |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austrian rule===
When the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] annexed these provinces after the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament, based in the city of [[Zadar]], and political parties such as the [[Autonomist Party]] and the [[People's Party (Dalmatia)|People's Party]]. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of [[Napoleonic Wars|the Napoleonic Wars]] had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The combination of these two forces—a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community—posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the [[German language|German-speaking]] [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg monarchy]], with bilingual (Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Croatian Catholic majority (and a [[Orthodox Church|Slavic Orthodox]] minority).

[[File:Libertas.svg|thumb|right|The "Libertas" Flag of Dubrovnik]]

In 1815, the former Dubrovnik Government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in [[Mokošica]]. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.

In 1832, Baron [[Šišmundo Getaldić-Gundulić]] (''Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola'') (1795–1860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of "Baron".

[[Pucić (family)|Count Rafael Pucić]] (''Raffaele Pozza''), (1828–1890) was elected for first time Podestà of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Korčula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podestà) of Dubrovnik Rafael Pucić, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review "Slovinac"; by the communities of Kuna and Orebić, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.

[[File:Fran Gundulic2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Unveiling of the Gundulić monument]] in 1893]]
In 1889, the [[Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik|Serb-Catholics]] circle supported Baron [[Frano Getaldić-Gundulić|Francesco Ghetaldi-Gondola]], the candidate of the [[Autonomist Party|Autonomous Party]], vs the candidate of Popular Party [[Vlaho de Giulli]], in the 1890 election to the Dalmatian Diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trudna tożsamość: problemy narodowościowe i religijne w Europie Środkowo-Wschodniej w XIX i XX wieku|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOVJAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Instytut Europy Środkowo-Wschodnej|isbn=978-83-85854-17-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, during the local government election, the Autonomous Party won the municipal re-election with Francesco Gondola, who died in power in 1899. The alliance won the election again on 27 May 1894. Frano Getaldić-Gundulić founded the ''Società [[Philately]]'' on 4 December 1890.

In 1905, the Committee for establishing electric [[tram service]], headed by Luko Bunić – certainly one of the most deserving persons who contributed to the realisation of the project – was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato Šarić, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Gracić, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Katić and Antun Milić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tramway in Dubrovnik |publisher=[[Croatian Post]] |url=https://www.posta.hr/print.aspx?id=3622&amp;m=2138&amp;p=-1 |work=posta.hr |accessdate=2017-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303051142/https://www.posta.hr/print.aspx?id=3622&amp;m=2138&amp;p=-1 |archive-date=2017-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trams in Dubrovnik|The tram service in Dubrovnik]] existed from 1910 to 1970.

[[Čingrija|Pero Čingrija]] (1837–1921), one of the leaders of the People's Party in Dalmatia,&lt;ref name="hrcak.srce.hr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/18700|title=Dvije pobjede don Ive Prodana na izborima za Carevinsko vijeće u Beču|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  played the main role in the merger of the People's Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.

===1918–1991===
With the fall of [[Austria–Hungary]] in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] (later the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|oblast]]s of the Kingdom. When in 1929 Yugoslavia was divided among 9 [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Banovina]], the city became part of the [[Zeta Banovina]]. In 1939 Dubrovnik became part of the newly created [[Banovina of Croatia]].

During [[World War II]], Dubrovnik became part of the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-puppet [[Independent State of Croatia]], occupied by the [[Italian Army|Italian army]] first, and by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German army]] after 8 September 1943. In October 1944 [[Yugoslav Partisans]] occupied Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the [[Daksa Massacre]].&lt;ref name="pleasance"&gt;Pleasance, Chris, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2470203/Daksa-Croatian-island-48-Nazi-sympathisers-killed-sale-1-7m.html "Would You Pay £1.7m for the Island of Death?"], ''Mail Online''; accessed 4 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/world/6-uninhabited-and-mysterious-islands-bizarre-pasts-161026 "6 Uninhabited and Mysterious Islands with Bizarre Pasts"], ''The Daily Star'', 28 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik.&lt;ref&gt;Politički zatvorenik {{cite web|url=http://www.hdpz.t-com.hr/broj236/Franic.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307124242/https://www.hdpz.t-com.hr/broj236/Franic.htm |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }} Retrieved 16 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Under communism Dubrovnik became part of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. In 1979, the city joined the [[UNESCO]] list of World Heritage Sites.

[[File:Dubrovnik shelling.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Dubrovnik shelling (black dots) 1991 to 1992]]
In 1991 Croatia and [[Slovenia]], which at that time were republics within [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], declared their independence. At that event, [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] was renamed [[Croatia|Republic of Croatia]].

Despite [[demilitarisation]] of the old town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia's independence in 1991 [[Yugoslavia]]'s [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), by then composed primarily of Serbs, attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up military outpost in the city itself. [[Montenegro]], led by president [[Momir Bulatović]], and prime minister [[Milo Đukanović]], coming to power in the [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution]] and allied to [[Slobodan Milošević]] in Serbia, declared that Dubrovnik would not remain in Croatia because they claimed it historically had never been part of [[Croatia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} This was in spite of the large Croat majority in the city and that very few Montenegrins resided there, though Serbs accounted for 6.8 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="yorku1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/soi/_Vol_5_1/_HTML/Pavlovic.html |title=Reckoning: The 1991 Siege of Dubrovnik and the Consequences of the “War for Peace”|work=Yorku.ca |publisher=[[York University]] |author=Srđa Pavlović | accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 1991 Dubrovnik was attacked by [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] with a [[siege of Dubrovnik]] that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on December 6 with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to Croatian [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], was 114 killed civilians, among them poet [[Milan Milišić]].

== Geography==

=== Climate ===
Dubrovnik has a borderline [[humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') and [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'') in the [[Köppen climate classification]], since only one summer month has less than {{convert|40|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean. It has hot, muggy, moderately dry summers and mild to cool, wet winters. The [[Bora (wind)|bora wind]] blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common all the year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach {{convert|28|°C}}, and at night drop to around {{convert|23|°C}}. In Spring and Autumn maximum temperatures are typically between {{convert|20|°C}} and {{convert|28|°C|0}}. Winters are among the mildest of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around {{convert|13|°C}} in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.

The annual [[Dubrovnik Summer Festival]] is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts, and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.

The [[patron saint]] of the city is [[Saint Blaise|Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise)]], whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark the Evangelist]] to Venice. One of the larger churches in city is named after Saint Blaise.
February 3 is the feast of [[Saint Blaise|Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise)]], who is the city's patron saint. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tzdubrovnik.hr/clanak.shtml?clanak=890 |title=DUBROVNIK news |author= |date=21 October 2007 |work=archive.org |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021141211/http://web.tzdubrovnik.hr/clanak.shtml?clanak=890 |archivedate=2007-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city boasts of many old buildings, such as the [[Trsteno|Arboretum Trsteno]], the oldest [[arboretum]] in the world, dating back to before 1492. Also, the third oldest European [[pharmacy]] is located in the city, which dates back to 1317 (and is the only one still in operation today). It is located at Little Brothers monastery in Dubrovnik.&lt;ref name=dbvonl15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubrovnik-online.net/english/monuments.php |title=Monuments (1 to 5) |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nZfoXB6a?url=http://www.dubrovnik-online.com/english/monuments.php |archivedate=2010-02-16 |accessdate=2010-02-16 |publisher=Dubrovnik Online |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In history, many Conversos ([[Marrano]]s) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with [[Portugal|Portuguese]] refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, [[George Bernard Shaw]], visited the city in 1929 and said: "If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tz-seget.hr/en/40/dubrovnik|title=TZ Seget – Dubrovnik|author=|date=|work=tz-seget.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aventalearning.com/courses/GEOGx-HS-A09/b/Unit06/GeoHS_6.A.7.html|title=Eastern Europe: Where Is Eastern Europe?|author=|date=|work=aventalearning.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bay of Dubrovnik is the {{convert|72|ha|adj=on}} wooded island of [[Lokrum]], where according to legend, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart, King of England]], was cast ashore after being [[shipwreck]]ed in 1192. The island includes a fortress, [[botanical garden]], [[monastery]] and [[Nude beach|naturist beach]].

Among the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik's main public [[beach]], is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ue-4o37AficC&amp;pg=PA57 |title=Frommer's Croatia |author=Karen Tormé Olson |author2=Sanja Bazulic Olson |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=2006 |pages=57–58 |isbn=0-7645-9898-8 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after the popular beach in [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Rio de Janeiro]].

Dubrovnik's most beloved church is [[St Blaise's church]], built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik's patron saint.

The Neapolitan architect and engineer [[Onofrio della Cava]] completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio's Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Bunić Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]]s. The Little Onofrio's Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water the market place in the Luža Square. The sculptures ware made by the Milanese artist [[Pietro di Martino]] (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector's Palace and made a statue – now lost – for the Franciscan church).

The {{convert|31|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} bell tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Grubačević, Utišenović and Radončić. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect [[Marino Gropelli]] (who also built St Blaise's church).

The Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected in 1418 the statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to [[:Category:Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (1368–1437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa's independence. It stands in the middle of Luža Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor [[Bonino of Milano]], with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one [[ell]] of Dubrovnik is equal to {{convert|51.2|cm|1|abbr=on}}.

===Walls of Dubrovnik===
{{Main|Walls of Dubrovnik}}
A feature of Dubrovnik is its walls (1.2 million visitors in 2017) that run almost {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=off}} around the city. The walls are {{convert|4|to(-)|6|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King's Landing in the [[HBO]] television series, ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatiatraveller.com/southern_dalmatia/Dubrovnik/Walls.htm |title=Dubrovnik's Walls |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nZiU3E3K?url=http://www.croatiatraveller.com/southern_dalmatia/Dubrovnik/Walls.htm |archivedate=2010-02-16 |accessdate=2010-02-16 |publisher=Croatia Traveller |last=Oliver |first=Jeanne |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cite web |url=http://www.dubrovnik-online.net/english/transportation_rail.php |title=Transportation Rail |accessdate=20 June 2009 |publisher=Dubrovnik Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1975 Dubrovnik was [[Croatian Railways#Dubrovnik|connected]] to [[Mostar]] and [[Sarajevo]] by a [[narrow gauge railway]] (760&amp;nbsp;mm)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penmorfa.com/JZ/dubrovnik2.html |title=Dubrovnik to Sarajevo 1965 |accessdate=27 September 2011 |publisher=Charlie Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penmorfa.com/JZ/jhorsford.html |title=Dubrovnik to Capljina in 1972 |accessdate=27 September 2011 |publisher=Jim Horsford}}&lt;/ref&gt; built during the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina (Austro-Hungarian condominium)|Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia]].

The [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway, in use between [[Zagreb]] and [[Ploče]], is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the [[Pelješac Bridge]] whose construction is in preparation as of 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://crbc-croatia.com/en/2018/08/23/23-08-2018-2/|title=The examination of the seabed started|publisher=[[China Road and Bridge Corporation]]|date=23 August 2018|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or run through [[Neum]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and continue to Dubrovnik.

==Biography==
Born in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], shortly after World War II. Her parents, Boris and Maria Wydra, survived the Holocaust by hiding in a forest bunker and then by being hidden in a peasant's barn. In 1959, at the age of 13, she emigrated with her parents and sister to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. Upon graduating from high school she received a scholarship and studied English literature at [[Rice University]] in Houston, [[Yale School of Music]], and [[Harvard University]]. At the latter university, she received a [[Ph.D.]] in English and American literature in 1975.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

Hoffman has been a professor of literature and creative writing at various institutions, such as [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Tufts]], and [[CUNY]]'s [[Hunter College]]. From 1979 to 1990, she worked as an editor and writer at [[The New York Times]], serving as senior editor of "The Book Review" from 1987 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townsendcenter.berkeley.edu/una_hoffmann.shtml |title=Eva Hoffman, Writer &amp; Academic &amp;#124; Townsend Center for the Humanities |publisher=Townsendcenter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, she received the Jean Stein Award from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and in 1992, the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for General Nonfiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/6712-eva-hoffman |title=Eva Hoffman - John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation |publisher=Gf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728072906/http://www.gf.org/fellows/6712-eva-hoffman |archivedate=2012-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Whiting Awards|Whiting Award]]. In 2000, Eva Hoffman was the Year 2000 Una Lecturer at the Townsend Center for the Humanities at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 2008, she was awarded an honorary [[DLitt]] by the [[University of Warwick]]. She has presented radio programmes and is the recipient of the [[Prix Italia]] for radio.

She presently lives in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = A Sense of Ourselves |number=3 | network      = BBC| station      = Radio 3

Fjellestad writes on ''Lost in Translation: A Life in a New Language'': [It] is, to the best of my knowledge, the first "postmodern" autobiography written in English by an emigre from a European Communist country." She also writes that in the memoir, "Hoffman re-visions and reconstructs her Polish self through her American identity, and re-examines her American subjectivity through the memory of her Polish selfhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Insertion of the Self into the Space of Borderless Possibility: Eva Hoffman's Exiled Body | journal = Varieties of Ethnic Criticism | first = Danuta Zadworna | last = Fjellestad | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–147 | accessdate = 2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Farnley Wood Plot''' was a conspiracy in [[northern England]] in October 1663. Intended as a major rising to overturn the return to monarchy in 1660, it was undermined by informers, and came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Also known as the '''Derwentdale Plot''' and the '''Yorkshire Plot'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major plotters were [[Joshua Greathead]] and [[Captain Thomas Oates]], operating primarily in [[Farnley, West Yorkshire]], but also with links to [[Gildersome]], [[Morley, West Yorkshire]] and [[Leeds]]. The aim was to capture and overthrow the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] strongholds of Leeds city centre. The plot was disbanded on 12 October 1663. Twenty-six men were arrested, imprisoned and then [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] as traitors.

==Background==
After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy and government by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], the son of defeated and executed king [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], there was still division in the nation. Fear of Catholicism continued, fed by the success of the [[Counter Reformation]] in Europe. The religious settlement had re-established the Church of England, but [[presbyterian]]s and other dissenters were suspicious of what they considered its 'Popish' practices. Charles II was at least sympathetic to Catholicism. This wave of radical dissension was found throughout the country but was particularly pronounced in the north, leading to its characterization as the 'Northern Rebellion'. The Crown took steps to suppress the movement by arresting known agitators.

[[Paul Hobson]], a Particular Baptist preacher who was involved in the planning of the rebellion, was arrested on 20 August. He was later accused of having turned informer.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=37554|title=Hobson, Paul|first=Richard L.|last=Greaves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The plot==
The Farnley Wood Plot was launched in Farnley, in Leeds, by two main players, both of Parliamentarian sympathies. One was Joshua Greathead, a local squire who had fought in the Civil War in [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army and had led his own squadron. He was a resident of [[Gildersome]], one of the villages nearest to Farnley. The other was Captain Thomas Oates of [[Morley, West Yorkshire|Morley]]. Farnley, lying halfway between Leeds and Morley and largely wooded, provided an ideal location to meet in numbers. The declared objectives of the plot were "to re-establish a gospel ministry and magistracy; to restore the Long Parliament; to relieve themselves from the excise and all subsidies and to reform all orders and degrees of men, especially the lawyers and clergy".&lt;ref name = FWP/&gt; The main aim of the plan of campaign may have been to storm the Royalist strongholds in the city of [[Leeds]].

On the morning of 12 October 1663, a poor turn-out of only twenty six men had convened, mostly Presbyterian local farmers and businessmen, who were not prepared to fight in battle. The plot was thus deemed a failure, the meeting broke up and all returned to their villages. However, Greathead had turned informer after being overruled in favour of the plans made by Oates and had alerted the  authorities, who set in motion the arrest of the twenty-six people.

== Aftermath ==

The arrested men were taken to await the [[Assizes#England and Wales|assizes]] in York, where they were remanded in [[York Castle|Clifford's tower]].  Those tried and sentenced to death for [[High treason in the United Kingdom|treason]] were Thomas Oates, Samuel Ellis, John Nettleton snr, John Nettleton jnr, Robert Scott, William Tolson, John Forster, Robert Olroyd, John Asquith, Peregrine Corney, John Snowden, John Smith, William Ash, John Errington, Robert Atkinson, William Colton, George Denham ("The Grand Agitator"), Henry Watson, Richard Wilson, Ralph Rymer and John Carre.&lt;ref name = FWP&gt;{{cite book| title= The civil, ecclesiastical [&amp;c.] history of Leeds, Halifax, Huddersfield ...|first = Edward|last = Parsons|year = 1834|page= 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most were hanged, drawn and quartered in a single morning in York and three at Northallerton. Robert Olroyd and Peregrine Corney were separately executed. Three of the men (Robert Atkins, John Errington and Henry Wilson) had managed to escape to Leeds. There they hid in an inn, but were finally re-arrested and, on 14 January 1664, sentenced to death for treason. They were transported to [[Chapeltown, West Yorkshire|Chapeltown]] Moor, where a [[gallows]] had been constructed. They were hung by chains, before being dissected. The executioner, a local joiner of the name of Peter Mason, cut off the three heads and preserved them. The following day, they were stuck on the railings of Moot Hall. In 1677 the skulls were blown down in a gale.

Others implicated in the general uprising included [[Thomas Palmer (minister)|Thomas Palmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Palmer, Thomas (fl.1644-1666)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities also rounded up Parliamentarian sympathisers throughout the country including [[John Hutchinson (Roundhead)|John Hutchinson]], [[Thomas Jollie]], [[Richard Salwey]], [[Robert Venables]], [[Henry Neville (writer)]], and [[Henry Wilkinson (dean)|Henry Wilkinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Their ODNB articles.&lt;/ref&gt; Most were released from lack of evidence but Hutchinson died while incarcerated in [[Sandown Castle, Kent|Sandown Castle]].

When the [[Cavalier Parliament]] met again in early 1664, it repealed the [[Triennial Act]]. This legislative step has been attributed to the effect on domestic politics of the uncovering of the ramifications of the plot for a northern rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Steven C. A. Pincus, ''Protestantism and Patriotism: Ideologies and the Making of English Foreign Policy, 1650-1668'' (2002), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Rising is also said to have led to the 1664 [[Conventicle Act 1664|Conventicle Act]], which sought to crack down on religious dissent. The Act penalised anyone who preached at or attended a dissenter congregation, or allowed dissenters to use their building.&lt;ref&gt;David Farr, 'British Monarchy: The Crisis of State 1642-89', p.112. Nelson Thornes, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederic William Howay''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}} (November 25, 1867 &amp;ndash; October 4, 1943), also spelled '''Frederick''', was a Canadian historian, lawyer, and jurist.

Born in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Ontario]], Howay moved to [[British Columbia]] as a child. After attending school in New Westminster, Howay wrote his Provincial Teachers' exam in 1884 in Victoria, British Columbia. He spent three years teaching at schools in Canoe Pass and Boundary Bay. In 1887, he studied law at [[Dalhousie University]] and received a Bachelor of Law degree in 1890. He was called to the British Columbia bar in 1891. In 1907, he was appointed a Judge of County Court of New Westminster. He retired in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.ubc.ca/spcoll/Inventories/Descriptions/H.html|title=Frederic William Howay Map Collection|work=University of British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, he was awarded the [[Royal Society of Canada]]'s [[J. B. Tyrrell Historical Medal]]. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the [[Royal Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.ca/index.php?lang_id=1&amp;page_id=148#TOC52|title=J.

From 1941 to 1942, he was president of the Royal Society of Canada. He also served as a member of the [[Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada]], briefly serving as its interim chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1979 |title=Recognizing Canadian History: The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada |publisher=Parks Canada |location=Ottawa |isbn=0-662-50533-6 |at=p. 62, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from the [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/hdcites/hdcites1.html|title=UBC Honorary Degree Citations|work=University of British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Judge Howay]], north of [[Stave Lake]], is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=British Columbia Place Names|author=Helen B.

'''''Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation''''' is a 2013 book by the German [[Political science|political scientist]] [[Christian Welzel]], professor of [[political culture]] and [[political sociology]] at [[Lüneburg University|Leuphana University Lueneburg]] and vice-president of the [[World Values Survey]].

==The Title==
The title, ''Freedom Rising'', refers to the rapid expansion of universal freedoms and democracy. As the author explains at the beginning of his book, people have never voiced their desires for freedoms so frequently and powerfully as today. They do so not only inside but even outside democracies.&lt;ref name="Welzel2013FR"&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 2| isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from here, Christian Welzel’s book is about the human quest for freedoms and the human desire for emancipation. The result is a far-reaching theory of emancipation, which describes the human empowerment process.

==Content and Structure==
The book comprises twelve chapters that are organized in four parts. While the first chapter is theoretical, all subsequent chapters are empirical and test the propositions laid out in Chapter 1. The empirical research builds on cross-cultural and longitudinal evidence form the [[World Values Survey]]s and European Values Surveys.

===Part A: Understanding Emancipative Values===
(Chapter 1:	A Theory of Emancipation;
Chapter 2:	Mapping Differences;
Chapter 3:	Multilevel Drivers;
Chapter 4:	Tracing Change)

The first part provides a basic understanding of emancipative values. Welzel introduces the endogenous cause to [[Human development theory|human development]] in his sequence thesis of [[emancipation]]. The thesis establishes a main direction of [[causality]] from action resources (founding element) to emancipative values (linking element) to civic entitlements (completing element). It argues that emancipative values result from expanding [[resources]] which implies that they are a [[Cultural universal|universal]] and not a Western-bound concept. The concept of cross-fertilization highlights the amplification of a person's values when they are shared by more people in the same society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | pages= 37–169 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part B: Emancipative Values as Civic Force===
(Chapter 5:	Intrinsic Qualities; 
Chapter 6:	Benign Individualism;
Chapter 7:	Collective Action)

The second part presents emancipative values as a pro-social set of values and a groundbreaking civic force that "unlocks a population's intrinsic qualities, vitalizes civil society, and creates social capital".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 12| isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welzel illustrates that rising emancipative values cause a strategic shift from acquisition strategies to thriving strategies. As thriving strategies aim at fulfillment, pro-social behavior is encouraged. The activating and empowering impulse of emancipative values instigates people to have their shared claims heard. As such emancipative values are a crucial source of bottom-up democratization processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | pages= 173–246| isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part C: Democratic Impulses of Emancipative Values===
(Chapter 8:	Entitling People;
Chapter 9:	The Rights Revolution;
Chapter 10:	The Paradox of Democracy)

The third part centers on the [[Democracy|democratic]] impulse that emanates from emancipative values. Welzel presents democracy as the institutional element of people's power and action resources together with emancipative values as the two pre-institutional elements of [[people power]]. Empirical evidence shows that rising emancipative values have a much higher effect on expanding rights than rights have on rising emancipative values. Welzel concludes that institutions themselves cannot create empowering qualities but depend on them so that the source of democracy lies in the people's desire for emancipation. Here, ''Freedom Rising'' disproves the prominent view in political economy which states that institutions come first. Finally, chapter 10 solves the democratic paradox that widespread desires for democracy among people coexist with deficient or even absent democracy. Welzel argues that this is the case when these desires are decoupled from an emphasis on emancipative values that is a critical-liberal orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | pages= 249–331 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part D: Emancipative Values in Human Civilization===
(Chapter 11:	The Redirection of Civilization;
Chapter 12:	The Sustainability Challenge)

The last part looks at emancipative values from a broad civilizational perspective and discusses their significance in history. Welzel presents the [[#The Cool-Water Condition|cool-water condition]] (CW condition) as the truly exogenous cause of human empowerment. The last chapter elaborates on the role of emancipative values in meeting the [[sustainability]] challenge. Here, Welzel addresses the dilemma that results from the negative environmental impact of technological advancement on the one hand and the positive environmental impact of emancipative values on environmental quality on the other hand. Closer investigation shows that the negative impact of technological advancement is lower than the positive impact of emancipative values on environmental quality. Human empowerment thus helps redirecting society towards [[sustainable development]].

==The Human Empowerment Process==
The Human Empowerment Process is defined by Welzel as a "humanistic transformation of civilization that makes societies increasingly people-powered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 6 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be observed when freedoms grow so that Welzel calls it an emancipatory process. It is completed when people are acting freely as agents of their values.
Welzel distinguishes between three different stages of the human condition in societies. The human condition can be (1) suffering – weak capabilities and narrow guarantees, (2) struggling – mediocre capabilities and guarantees, (3) thriving – strong capabilities and wide guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page=22 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A Theory of Emancipation==
Welzel builds his human empowerment framework on an evolutionary theory of [[emancipation]]. Emancipation is hereby understood as the universal human desire for an existence free from domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 37 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emancipative values emphasize [[freedom of choice]] and [[equal opportunity|equality of opportunities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 5 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Freedom Rising Welzel identifies the human desire to live free from external constraints as the single source of the human empowerment trend.

The theory of emancipation rests upon one evolutionary root principle: the utility ladder of freedom. Welzel argues that emancipative values do not guide people's actions as long as existential constraints on human life are strong. However, freedoms gain utility when people become more capable due to improving living conditions and rising action resources. In this case emancipative values start guiding people's actions. Emancipative values thus constitute the psychological core and the inspirational source of the human empowerment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 2 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such they motivate social movement activity and promote anti-discrimination norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 5 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since joint action among capable and motivated people is so difficult to resist, rulers must at some point give in and guarantee the claimed entitlements, and also abide by them. The third element in the human empowerment process is thus [[civic right|civic entitlements]].

==The Sequence Thesis of Emancipation==
The Sequence thesis explains the endogenous causation of the human empowerment process. It establishes the dominant flow of impact among the three elements of the human development process from action resources to emancipative values to civic entitlements. Freedoms grow in a utility-value-guarantee sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 37 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The sequence thesis implies an important condition, which defies the most common view that human development is caused by institutions. In contrast to other political scientists like [[Francis Fukuyama]], [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]], Christian Welzel demonstrates that institutions guaranteeing universal freedoms are not the cause but the result of the human empowerment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 38 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cool-Water Condition==
The sequence thesis of emancipation theory fails to deliver an [[exogeny|exogenous]] causation of human empowerment. Chapter 11 thus introduces a second thesis — the source thesis of emancipation. It posits the original source of human empowerment in the cool-water condition (CW-condition), which "is a combination of (1) moderately cold climates, (2) continuous rainfalls over all seasons, and (3) permanently navigable waterways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 366 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the source thesis, CW areas offer water [[autonomy]] and a higher disease security which naturally locates them higher on the utility ladder of freedom. Welzel demonstrates that the CW condition prevented a transition to agriculture in the first place since foraging was a freer lifestyle. Technological advancement in CW areas was thus lower than in other areas for a long time. With emerging urban markets the situation changed. Water autonomy created derivative autonomies that turned out to be an accelerator of technological advancement. Autonomy in market access encouraged a transition to quality-breeding strategies in people's reproductive behavior with the result that the workforce became less numerous but more valuable. Rising labor demands provided an incentive to invent technologies that save costly labor. The technological advancement involved more widespread action resources, which enhanced people's capabilities to exercise freedoms. From here the sequence thesis of emancipation takes over.

Until today human development is far advanced in all of the world's CW areas, that is in [[Western Europe]], in [[Japan]], in distinctive areas of [[Northern America]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].

Welzel stresses that — in the era of [[globalization]] — human empowerment begins to diffuse elsewhere and slowly dissociates from the CW condition. This erodes the monopoly of the West over human empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Welzel, C. | title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=February 2013 | page= 375 | isbn=978-1-107-03470-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generation Z''' or '''Gen Z''',  also known by [[#Terminology|a number of other names]] is the demographic [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] after the [[Millennials]] (Generation Y). There is no precise date for when Generation Z begins, but demographers and researchers typically use the mid-1990s to mid-2000s as a starting birth years. There is little consensus regarding ending birth years. &lt;!-- This range is based on the sources given in the text below; please seek talk page consensus before changing --&gt;

Most of Generation Z have used the [[Internet]] since a young age and are comfortable with [[technology]] and [[social media]].

==Terminology==
[[Strauss and Howe|William Strauss and Neil Howe]] wrote [[Strauss-Howe generational theory|several books]] on the subject of generations and are widely credited with coining the term ''[[Millennials]]''.&lt;ref name=Horovitz&gt;{{cite news|last=Horovitz|first=Bruce|title=After Gen X, Millennials, what should next generation be? |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/advertising/story/2012-05-03/naming-the-next-generation/54737518/1|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howe has said "No one knows who will name the next generation after the Millennials".&lt;ref name=Horovitz/&gt; In 2005, their company sponsored an online contest in which respondents voted overwhelmingly for the name ''Homeland Generation''. That was not long after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]], and one fallout of the disaster was that Americans may have felt more safe staying at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Millennials &amp; K-12 Schools |first1=Neil |last1=Howe |first2=William |last2=Strauss |authorlink=Strauss and Howe|year=2008 |publisher=LifeCourse Associates |isbn=0-9712606-5-6|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howe has described himself as "not totally wed" to the name and cautioned that "names are being invented by people who have a great press release.

In 2012, ''[[USA Today]]'' sponsored an online contest for readers to choose the name of the next generation after the Millennials. The name ''Generation Z'' was suggested, although journalist Bruce Horovitz thought that some might find the term "off-putting". Some other names that were proposed included: ''iGeneration'', ''Gen Tech'', ''Gen Wii'', ''Net Gen'', ''[[Digital Native]]s'', and ''Plurals''.&lt;ref name=Horovitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Connecting to the Net.Generation: What higher education professionals need to know about today's students|first1=Reynol|last1=Junco|authorlink=Reynol Junco|first2=Jeanna|last2=Mastrodicasa|year=2007|publisher=NASPA|isbn=978-0-931654-48-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Homan|first1=Audrey|title=Z is for Generation Z|url=http://tiie.w3.uvm.edu/blog/who-are-generation-z/|accessdate=6 June 2016|publisher=The Tarrant Institute for Innovative Education|date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Post-Millennial'' is a name given by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Pew Research in statistics published in 2016 showing the relative sizes and dates of the generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/25/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers/|title=Millennials overtake Baby Boomers as America's largest generation|last=|first=|date=25 April 2016|website=Pew Research Center|publisher=Pew Research|access-date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same sources showed that {{as of|2016|April|lc=y}}, the Millennial generation surpassed the population of Baby Boomers in the USA (77 million ''vs''. 76 million in 2015 data),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2015/01/FT_16_04.25_generations2050.png|title=Projected Population by Generation|last=|first=|date=25 April 2016|website=Millennials overtake Baby Boomers as America's largest generation|publisher=Pew Research|access-date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the Post-Millennials were ahead of the Millennials in another Health and Human Services survey (69 million ''vs''. 66 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2015/01/FT_16_04.25_generationsBirths.png|title=Birth Under Each Generation|last=|first=|date=25 April 2016|website=Millennials overtake Baby Boomers as America's largest generation|publisher=Pew Research|access-date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''iGeneration'' (or ''iGen'') is a name that several persons claim to have coined. Demographer [[Cheryl Russell]] claims to have first used the term in 2009.&lt;ref name=Horovitz/&gt; Psychology professor and author [[Jean Twenge]] claims that the name ''iGen'' "just popped into her head" while she was driving near [[Silicon Valley]], and that she had intended to use it as the title of her 2006 book ''Generation Me'' about the Millennial generation, until it was overridden by her publisher.&lt;ref name=Horovitz/&gt; In 2012, [[Ad Age]] magazine thought that ''iGen'' was "the name that best fits and will best lead to understanding of this generation".&lt;ref name=Horovitz/&gt; In 2014, an [[NPR]] news intern noted that ''iGeneration'' "seems to be winning" as the name for the post-Millennials.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|title=From GIs To Gen Z (Or Is It iGen?): How Generations Get Nicknames|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/06/349316543/don-t-label-me-origins-of-generational-names-and-why-we-use-them|publisher=NPR|accessdate=7 October 2014|first=Samantha | last=Raphelson|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, Jean Twenge saw smartphones and social media as raising an unhappy, compliant "iGen", which she described as the generation born after 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.enca.com/analysis/smartphones-raising-mentally-fragile-generation|title=Smartphones raising a mentally fragile generation|work=eNCA|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.montreat.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/reflection-spring-2018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank N. Magid Associates, an advertising and marketing agency, nicknamed this cohort ''The Pluralist Generation'' or ''Plurals''.&lt;ref name="FNMagid"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://magid.com/sites/default/files/pdf/MagidPluralistGenerationWhitepaper.pdf|title = The First Generation of the 21st Century: An Introduction to the Pluralist Generation|last = |first = |date = 2012|journal = Magid Generational Strategies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 15 January 2016|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080730/http://magid.com/sites/default/files/pdf/MagidPluralistGenerationWhitepaper.pdf|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turner Broadcasting System]] also advocated calling the post-millennial generation ''Plurals''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Turner Says the Post-Millennial Generation Should Be Known as 'Plurals'|url = http://www.adweek.com/news/television/turner-says-post-millennial-generation-should-be-known-plurals-168994|website = AdWeek|access-date = 31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeBord&gt;DeBord, Mathew.

[[MTV]] has labeled the generation ''The Founders'', based on the results of a survey they conducted in March 2015. MTV President Sean Atkins commented, "they have this self-awareness that systems have been broken, but they can't be the generation that says we'll break it even more."&lt;ref name="Founders"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sunburn|first1=Josh|title=Here's What MTV Is Calling the Generation After Millennials|url=http://time.com/4130679/millennials-mtv-generation/|accessdate=6 May 2016|publisher=Time|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kantar Group|Kantar Futures]] has named this cohort ''The Centennials''.&lt;ref name="Williams, Alex"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/fashion/how-to-spot-a-member-of-generation-z.html | title=How to Spot a Member of Generation Z | publisher=New York Times | date=18 September 2015 | accessdate=10 March 2016 | author=Williams, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FuturesCompany"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefuturescompany.com/centennials-infographic/|title=Centennial Infographic – The Futures Company|website=The Futures Company|language=en-US|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a BBC article was published that presented Generation Z individuals referring to themselves as innovative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/41348207/were-not-lazy-were-innovative---generation-z-hits-back-in-live-debate|title='We're not lazy, we're innovative' - Generation Z hits back in live debate - BBC Newsbeat|date=2017-09-26|website=BBC Newsbeat|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2017, an Exago article described that doing business today requires understanding of the solid link between innovation and individuals belonging to the Generation Z group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.exago.com/blog/generation-z-and-innovation-in-the-workplace|title=Generation Z and innovation in the workplace|date=2017-08-31|work=Exago|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a ''[[New York Times]]'' survey saw support for the name ''Delta Generation'' or ''Deltas''. The ''Times'' staff selected ''Delta Generation'' as its favorite label, with one submitter explaining, "Delta is used to denote change and uncertainty in mathematics and the sciences, and my generation was shaped by change and uncertainty."&lt;ref name=Bromwich&gt;{{cite news|last=Bromwich|first=Jonah|title=Tell Us What to Call the Generation After Millennials (Please) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/style/generation-names.html|accessdate=20 Feb 2018|newspaper=New York Times|date=23 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2018&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bromwich|first1=Jonah|title=We Asked Generation Z to Pick a Name.

[[Statistics Canada]] has noted that the cohort is sometimes referred to as ''the Internet generation'', as it is the first generation to have been born after the popularization of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Generations in Canada|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/98-311-x/98-311-x2011003_2-eng.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the cohort is described as ''Neo-Digital Natives'', a step beyond the previous cohort described as ''Digital Natives''. Digital Natives primarily communicate by text or voice, while neo-digital natives use video or movies. This emphasizes the shift from PC to mobile and text to video among the neo-digital population.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z8Kahia4IQEC|title=Deconstructing Digital Natives: Young People, Technology, and the New Literacies|last=Thomas|first=Michael|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-73900-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Japanese Youth and Mobile Media"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Takahashi|first1=Toshie T|title=Japanese Youth and Mobile Media|url=https://www.academia.edu/350038/Japanese_Youth_and_Mobile_Media|accessdate=10 May 2016|publisher=Rikkyo University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, survivors of the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]], themselves members of Generation Z, started to refer to themselves as the mass shooting generation, though school shootings such as the [[Columbine High School massacre]] have also been associated with earlier generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=CBSNews|title=Parkland shooting survivors say the NRA is "basically threatening" them|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-hogg-emma-gonzalez-parkland-florida-shooting-survivors-nra-threats/|accessdate=20 March 2018|date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 report from [[Pew Research Center]] defines "Post-Millennials" as born from 1997 onward, choosing this date for "key political, economic and social factors", including [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]]. This date makes Post-Millennials four years of age or younger at the time of the attacks, so having little or no memory of the event. Pew indicated they would use 1997 for future publications but would remain open to date recalibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/01/defining-generations-where-millennials-end-and-post-millennials-begin/|title=Defining generations: Where Millennials end and post-Millennials begin|date=1 March 2018|publisher=PEW Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier 2014 publication from Pew Research included the year 2000 as start year for the cohort, as part of an interview with Paul Taylor, author of  ''The Next America: Boomers, Millennials, and the Looming Generational Showdown.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/12/what-would-you-name-todays-youngest-generation-of-americans/|title=What would you name today’s youngest generation of Americans?|date=12 March 2014|publisher=PEW Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Strauss–Howe generational theory|Neil Howe]] defines the cohort as people born from approximately 2005–2025, but describes the dividing line between Generation Z and Millennials as "tentative" saying, "you can’t be sure where history will someday draw a cohort dividing line until a generation fully comes of age".

Generation Z are often children of [[Generation X]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Alex|title=Move Over, Millennials, Here Comes Generation Z|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/fashion/move-over-millennials-here-comes-generation-z.html|accessdate=8 April 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beltramini|first1=Elizabeth|title=Gen Z: Unlike the Generation Before|url=https://www.acui.org/Publications/The_Bulletin/2014/2014-10/26390/|accessdate=8 April 2016|publisher=Associations of College Unions International|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Ryan|title=15 Aspects That Highlight How Generation Z Is Different From Millennials|url=http://www.business2community.com/social-data/15-aspects-that-highlight-how-generation-z-is-different-from-millennials-01244940#4QkQVw62SQVFe3hk.97|accessdate=29 March 2016|publisher=Business2Community|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they also have parents who are Millennials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quigley|first1=Mary|title=The Scoop on Millennials' Offspring — Gen Z|url=http://www.aarp.org/home-family/friends-family/info-2016/technology-and-millennials-children-mq.html|accessdate=9 July 2016|publisher=AARP|date=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Public Relations Society of America]], the [[Great Recession]] has taught Generation Z to be independent, and has led to an entrepreneurial desire, after seeing their parents and older siblings struggle in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.prsa.org/Intelligence/Tactics/Articles/view/11057/1110/Move_Over_Millennials_Here_Comes_Generation_Z_Unde|title = Move Over Millennials, Here Comes Generation Z: Understanding the 'New Realists' Who Are Building the Future|date = 10 December 2015|accessdate = |website = Public Relations Tactics|publisher = Public Relations Society of America|last = Dupont|first = Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 survey by [[Ameritrade]] found that 47% in the United States (considered here to be those between the ages of 14 and 23) were concerned about [[student debt]], while 36% were worried about being able to afford a college education at all.&lt;ref name="Forbes2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jmaureenhenderson/2013/07/31/move-over-millennials-why-twentysomethings-should-fear-teens/ | title=Move Over, Millennials: Why 20-Somethings Should Fear Teens | publisher=Forbes | date=31 July 2013 | accessdate=5 November 2015 | author=Henderson, J Maureen}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generation is faced with a growing income gap and a shrinking middle-class, which all have led to increasing stress levels in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Generation Z: Technology and Social Interest|last = Turner|first = Anthony|date = 1 June 2015|journal = Journal of Individual Psychology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] and the Great Recession have greatly influenced the attitudes of this generation in the United States. However, unlike the older Millennials, Generation Z typically have no memories of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Since the oldest members were not yet cognizant when the 9/11 attacks occurred, there is no generational memory of a time the United States was not at war with the loosely defined forces of global terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Column: High-maintenance Generation Z heads to work|url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2012-06-27/generation-z-work-millenials-social-media-graduates/55845098/1|website = USATODAY.COM|accessdate = 17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/you-x-y-z-boomer-3950868|title=Are you X, Y, Z, Boomer or Silent Generation – what does it mean for you?|first=Alun|last=Palmer|date=1 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner suggests it is likely that both events have resulted in a feeling of unsettlement and insecurity among the people of Generation Z with the environment in which they were being raised. The economic recession of 2008 is particularly important to historical events that have shaped Generation Z, due to the ways in which their childhoods may have been affected by the recession's shadow; that is, the financial stresses felt by their parents.&lt;ref name="turner" /&gt;

A 2014 study ''Generation Z Goes to College'' found that Generation Z students self-identify as being loyal, compassionate, thoughtful, open-minded, responsible, and determined.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Generation Z Goes to College|last = Seemiller|first = Corey|publisher = Jossey-Bass|year = 2016|isbn = 978-1-119-14345-1|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; How they see their Generation Z peers is quite different from their own self-identity. They view their peers as competitive, spontaneous, adventuresome, and curious; all characteristics that they do not see readily in themselves.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, some authors consider that some of their competencies, such as reading competence, are being transformed due to their familiarity with digital devices, platforms and texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amiama-Espaillat|first=Cristina|last2=Mayor-Ruiz|first2=Cristina|date=2017|title=Digital Reading and Reading Competence – The influence in the Z Generation from the Dominican Republic|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=105–114|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-10|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 U.S. study found that church attendance during young adulthood was 41% among Generation Z, compared to 18 percent for Millennials at the same ages, 21 percent of Generation X, and 26 percent of Baby Boomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hope | first1 = J | year = 2016 | title = Get your campus ready for Generation Z | journal = Dean &amp; Provost | volume = 17 | issue = 8| pages = 1–7| doi=10.1002/dap.30174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generation Z is generally more risk-averse in certain activities than earlier generations. In 2013, 66% of teenagers (older members of Generation Z) had tried alcohol, down from 82% in 1991. Also in 2013, 8% of teenagers never or rarely wear a [[seat belt]] when riding in a car with someone else, as opposed to 26% in 1991.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Alex|title=Move Over, Millennials, Here Comes Generation Z|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/fashion/move-over-millennials-here-comes-generation-z.html|accessdate=16 December 2015|newspaper=New York Times|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research from the [[Annie E. Casey Foundation]] conducted in 2016 found Generation Z youth had lower teen pregnancy rates, less substance abuse, and higher on-time high school graduation rates compared with Millennials. The researchers compared teens from 2008 and 2014 and found a 40% drop in teen pregnancy, a 38% drop in drug and alcohol abuse, and a 28% drop in the percentage of teens who did not graduate on time from high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Generation Z Breaks Records in Education and Health Despite Growing Economic Instability of Their Families|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/generation-z-breaks-records-in-education-and-health-despite-growing-economic-instability-of-their-families-300287848.html|accessdate=22 June 2016|publisher=PR Newswire|date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blad|first1=Evie|title=Teenagers' Health, Educational Outcomes Improving, Report Finds|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/rulesforengagement/2016/06/teenagers_health_educational_outcomes_improving_report_finds.html|accessdate=22 June 2016|publisher=Education Week|date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology and social media ===
[[File:Children at school (8720604364).jpg|thumb|Generation Z was one of the first generations to have widespread access to the Internet at an early age.]]

Generation Z is the first cohort to have Internet technology readily available at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants Part 1|last = Prensky|first = Marc|date = 2001|journal = On the Horizon|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the web revolution that occurred throughout the 1990s, they have been exposed to an unprecedented amount of technology in their upbringing. As technology became more compact and affordable, the popularity of smartphones in the United States grew exponentially. Anthony Turner characterizes Generation Z as having a 'digital bond to the Internet', and argues that it may help youth to escape from emotional and mental struggles they face offline.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = Anthony | year = 2015 | title = Generation Z: Technology And Social Interest | url = | journal = Journal of Individual Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 103–113 | doi=10.1353/jip.2015.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to U.S. consultants Sparks and Honey in 2014, 41% of Generation Z spend more than three hours per day using computers for purposes other than schoolwork, compared with 22% in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fr.slideshare.net/sparksandhoney/generation-z-final-june-17/39-They_are_hyperaware_and_concernedabout | title=Meet Generation Z: Forget Everything You Learned About Millennials | publisher=Sparks and Honey | date=17 June 2014 | accessdate=16 December 2015 | page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an estimated 150,000 apps, 10% of those in Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], were educational and aimed at children up to college level.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Should CellPhones Be Allowed in School?|url = http://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/tech-ed/should-students-use-their-smartphones-as-learning-tools/|website = education.cu-portland.edu|accessdate = 1 December 2015|date = 2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While researchers and parents agree the change in educational paradigm is significant, the results of the changes are mixed. On one hand, smartphones offer the potential for deeper involvement in learning&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and more individualized instruction, thereby making this generation potentially better educated and more well-rounded. On the other hand, some researchers and parents are concerned that the prevalence of smartphones may cause technology dependence&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title = Mobile and interactive media use by young children: The good, the bad and the unknown|url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-01/bumc-mai013015.php|website = EurekAlert!|accessdate = 1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a lack of self-regulation that may hinder child development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An online newspaper about texting, [[SMS]] and MMS writes that teens own cellphones without necessarily needing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://textually.org/textually/archives/2005/03/007687.htm|title = Owning a cell phone is rite of passage for teenagers|date = 28 March 2005|accessdate = 7 December 2015|website = Textuality.org|publisher = |last = Regine|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211130032/http://textually.org/textually/archives/2005/03/007687.htm|archivedate = 11 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children become teenagers, receiving a phone is considered a rite of passage in some countries, allowing the owner to be further connected with their peers and it is now a social norm to have one at an early age. An article from the [[Pew Research Center]] stated that "nearly three-quarters of teens have or have access to a [[smartphone]] and 30% have a basic phone, while just 12% of teens 13 to 15 say they have no cell phone of any type".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/teens-social-media-technology-2015|title = Teens, Social Media &amp; Technology Overview 2015|date = 8 April 2015|accessdate = 5 December 2015|website = Pew Research Center|publisher = Pew Research Center Internet Science Tech RSS|last = Lenhart|first = Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers are only on the rise and the fact that the majority own a cell phone has become one of this generations defining characteristics. As a result of this "24% of teens go online 'almost constantly'".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One study has shown that teenagers in 2012 were more likely to share different types of information than teenagers in 2006 were.&lt;ref name=Madden&gt;{{cite news |last=Madden |first=Mary |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy. |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |accessdate=10 December 2015 |work=Pew Research Center |date=21 May 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they will take certain steps to protect certain information that they do not want being shared. They are more likely to "follow" others on social media than "share" and use different types of social media for different purposes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Focus group testing found that while teens may be annoyed by many aspects of Facebook, they continue to use it because participation is important in terms of socializing with friends and peers. [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]] are seen to be gaining popularity in member of Generation Z, with 24% (and growing) of teens with access to the Internet having Twitter accounts.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; This is, in part, due to parents not typically using these social networking sites.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; [[Snapchat]] is also seen to have gained attraction in Generation Z because videos, pictures, and messages send much faster on it than in regular messaging. Speed and reliability are important factors in members of Generation Z choice of social networking platform. This need for quick communication is presented in popular Generation Z apps like [[Vine (service)|Vine]] and the prevalent use of [[emojis]].&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

One study found that young people use the Internet as a way to gain access to information and to interact with others. Mobile technology, social media, and Internet use have become increasingly important to modern adolescents over the past decade. Very few, however, are changed from what they gain access to online.&lt;ref name="Borca 49–58"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Internet use and developmental tasks: Adolescents' point of view|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215004008|journal = Computers in Human Behavior|date = 1 November 2015|pages = 49–58|volume = 52|doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2015.05.029|first = Gabriella|last = Borca|first2 = Manuela|last2 = Bina|first3 = Peggy S.|last3 = Keller|first4 = Lauren R.|last4 = Gilbert|first5 = Tatiana|last5 = Begotti}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youths are using the Internet as a tool to gain social skills, that they then apply to real life situations, and learn about things that interest them. Teens spend most of their time online in private communication with people they interact with outside the Internet on a regular basis. While social media is used for keeping up with global news and connections, it is mainly used for developing and maintaining relationships with people with whom they are close in proximity. The use of social media has become integrated into the daily lives of most Gen Z'ers who have access to mobile technology. They use it on a daily basis to keep in contact with friends and family, particularly those who they see every day. As a result, the increased use of mobile technology has caused Gen Z'ers to spend more time on their smartphones, and social media and has caused online relationship development to become a new generational norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Internet Use|last = Borca|date = |journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gen Z'ers are generally against the idea of "[[photoshopping]]" (deleting imperfections in photos) and they are against changing themselves to be considered perfect. The parents of the Gen Z'ers fear the overuse of the Internet by their children. Parents dislike the ease of access to inappropriate information and images as well as social networking sites where children can gain access to people worldwide. Children reversely feel annoyed with their parents and complain about parents being overly controlling when it comes to their Internet usage.&lt;ref name="Borca 49–58" /&gt; Gen Z uses social media and other sites to strengthen bonds with friends and to develop new ones. They interact with people who they otherwise would not have met in the real world, becoming a tool for identity creation.&lt;ref name="Borca 49–58" /&gt;

According to Twenge, the negative side of the iGen is they are less "face to face" due to the extensive use of smartphones. They are also known to feel more lonely and left out.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.careerplanner.com/Career-Articles/Generations.cfm|title=The Generations - Which Generation are You?|first=MTR at CareerPlanner.com|last=Inc.|website=www.careerplanner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey of U.S. teenagers from an advertising agency J. Walter Thomson claims that the majority of teenagers are concerned about how their posting will be perceived by people or their friends. 72% of respondents said they were using social media on a daily basis, and 82% said they thought carefully about what they post on social media. Moreover, 43% said they had regrets about previous posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=J. Walter Thompson|title=CONSUMER INSIGHTS, J.

Jason Dorsey, who runs the Center for Generational Kinetics, stated in a TEDxHouston talk that this generation begins after 1996 to present. He stressed notable differences in the way that Millennials and Generation Z consume technology, in terms of smartphone usage at an earlier age. 18% of Generation Z thinks that it is okay for a 13-year-old to have a smartphone compared with earlier generations that say 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jasondorsey.com/tedx-talk-igen-gen-z/|title=Jason Dorsey TEDx Talk On Generation After Millennials: iGen Gen Z|website=Jason Dorsey|language=en-US|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=What do we know about the generation after millennials? {{!}} Jason Dorsey {{!}} TEDxHouston|date=18 November 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f16o9Q0XGE|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dorsey|first=Jason|date=2016|title=iGen Tech Disruption|url=http://genhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/iGen-Gen-Z-Tech-Disruption-Research-White-Paper-c-2016-Center-for-Generational-Kinetics.pdf|journal=Center for Generational Kinetics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of technology gave mobility and immediacy to Generation Z's consumption habits. The on-demand economy, defined as "the economic activity created by technology companies that fulfill consumer demand via the immediate provisioning of goods and service",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mike|first1=Jaconi|title=The 'On-Demand Economy' Is Revolutionizing Consumer Behavior|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-on-demand-economy-2014-7|website=Tech Insider|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has made changes in the way goods or services are delivered to consumers. Only the generation that grows up in the center of this transformation period will establish themselves as an immediacy demanding consumer.

Research conducted in 2017 reports that the social media usage patterns of this generation may be associated with loneliness, anxiety, and fragility and that girls may be more affected than boys by social media. According to 2018 CDC reports, girls are disproportionately affected by the negative aspects of social media than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2015. Youth Risk Behavior Survey Data. Available at: cdc.gov/yrbs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the University of Essex analyzed data from 10,000 families, from 2010-2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Booker|first=Cara L.|last2=Kelly|first2=Yvonne J.|last3=Sacker|first3=Amanda|date=2018-03-20|title=Gender differences in the associations between age trends of social media interaction and well-being among 10-15&amp;nbsp;year olds in the UK |journal=BMC Public Health|volume=18|issue=1|page=321|doi=10.1186/s12889-018-5220-4 |pmc=5859512|pmid=29554883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each family, they examined children who had grown from 10-15 during these years, and assessed their mental health utilizing two perspectives; happiness and well-being throughout social, familial, and educational perspectives. At age 10, 10% of female subjects reported social media use, while this was only true for 7% of the male subjects.  By age 15, this variation jumped to 53% for girls, and 41% for boys. This percentage influx may explain why more girls reported to experience cyberbullying, decreased self-esteem, and emotional instability, more than their male counterparts.

Other researchers hypothesize that girls are more affected by social media usage because of ''how'' they use it. In a study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2015, researchers discovered that while 78% girls reported to making a friend through social media, only 52% of boys could say the same.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/28/men-catch-up-with-women-on-overall-social-media-use/|title=Men catch up with women on overall social media use|date=2015-08-28|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, boys are not explicitly less affected by this statistic. They also found that 57% of boys claimed to make friends through video gaming, while this was only true for 13% of girls.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Another Pew Research Center survey conducted in April 2015, reported that women are more likely to use Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram than men. In counterpoint, men were more likely to utilize online forums, e-chat groups, and Reddit than women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Cyberbullying is more common now than among Millennials, the previous generation. It's more common among girls, 22% compared to 10% for boys. This results in young girls feeling more vulnerable to being excluded and undermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://childmind.org/report/2017-childrens-mental-health-report/smartphones-social-media/|title=Smartphones and Social Media - Child Mind Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Twenge |first1=Jean |date=22 August 2017 |title=IGen: Why Today's Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy--and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood--and What That Means for the Rest of Us |url= |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and culture==
===Music===
According to Girls Gen Z Digital media company Sweety High's 2018 Gen Z Music Consumption &amp; Spending Report, [[Spotify]] ranked first for music listening among Gen Z, [[terrestrial radio]] ranked second, while [[YouTube]] was reported to be the preferred platform for music discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hodak |first1=Brittany |title=New Study Spotlights Gen Z's Unique Music Consumption Habits |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brittanyhodak/2018/03/06/new-study-spotlights-gen-zs-unique-music-consumption-habits/#9c217042d09b |accessdate=6 March 2018 |work=Forbes |publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube contains music from  all musical genres and time periods, allowing Gen Z access to a wide variety of music which would not have easily been available to teens who came of age in the era of [[top 40 radio]] or [[MTV]]. Additionally, [[Soundcloud]] and [[Bandcamp]] allow Gen Z access to music from artists who are not yet signed to a music label.  According to [[Medium (website)|Medium]], teens are regularly consuming [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[hip-hop]] as well as [[country music|country]] subgenres and "the buzz around [[K-Pop]], [[trap music]] and [[bedroom pop]] bears witness to this musical awakening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lopez Rivera |first1=Salvador |title=Mac DeMarco &amp; Gen Z: Why The Indie Singer Is Conquering a Generation |url=https://medium.com/@salvadorlopz/mac-demarco-gen-z-why-the-indie-singer-is-conquering-a-generation-ae81f32d2094 |website=medium.com |publisher=Medium |accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
According to a [[Northeastern University]] Survey, 81% of Generation Z believes obtaining a college degree is necessary in achieving career goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 'Generation Z' is entrepreneurial, wants to chart its own future {{!}} news @ Northeastern|url = http://www.northeastern.edu/news/2014/11/generation-z-survey/|website = www.northeastern.edu|accessdate = 10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Generation Z enters high school, and they start preparing for college, a primary concern is paying for a college education without acquiring debt. Students report working hard in high school in hopes of earning scholarships and the hope that parents will pay the college costs not covered by scholarships. Students also report interest in [[ROTC]] programs as a means of covering college costs.&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{cite web |last=Hawkins |first=B. Denise |title = Here Comes Generation Z.

One third plan to rely on grants and scholarships and one quarter hope that their parents will cover the bulk of college costs. While the cost of attending college is incredibly high for most Gen Zers, according to ''NeaToday'', 65% say the benefits of graduating college exceed the costs.&lt;ref name="Hawkins" /&gt;

"Generation Z" is revolutionizing the educational system in many aspects. Thanks in part to a rise in the popularity of entrepreneurship and advancements in technology, high schools and colleges across the globe are including entrepreneurship in their curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northeastern.edu/news/2014/11/generation-z-survey/|title=‘Generation Z’ is entrepreneurial, wants to chart its own future – news @ Northeastern|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents of Generation Z might have the image of their child's first business being a lemonade stand or car wash. While these are great first businesses, Generation Z now has access to social media platforms, website builders, 3D printers, and drop shipping platforms which provides them with additional opportunities to start a business at a young age.

A 2017 survey produced by [[MTV]] and the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] found that 72% of Americans aged 15 to 24 held unfavorable views of President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alex|last1=Vandermaas-Peeler|first2=Daniel|last2=Cox|first3=Molly|last3=Fisch-Friedman|first4=Robert P.|last4=Jones|url=https://www.prri.org/research/mtv-culture-and-religion/|title=Diversity, Division, Discrimination: The State of Young America {{!}} MTV/PRRI Report|date=10 January 2018|accessdate=18 March 2018|publisher=[[Public Religion Research Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eugene|last=Scott|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/11/the-state-of-america-according-to-generation-z/|title=The state of America, according to Generation Z|date=11 January 2018|accessdate=18 March 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Hispanic Heritage Foundation]], U.S. members of Generation Z tend to be more [[conservative]] than Millennials. According to a survey of 83,298 Gen Z-aged students (defined here as those aged 14 to 18 in 2016) in the United States done by My College Options and the Hispanic Heritage Foundation in September and October 2016, 32% of participants supported Donald Trump, while 22% supported [[Hillary Clinton]] with 31% choosing to not vote in the election. The results were heavily divided along racial lines with White and Native American students favoring Trump by a 33-point and 20 point margin respectively, and Black and Hispanic students favoring Clinton by a 40-point and 22 point margin respectively. Asian students were more divided, favoring Clinton by a 10-point margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hispanicheritage.org/50000-generation-z-high-school-students-identify-republican/|title=50k 'Gen Z' Students Identify as Republican – Hispanic Heritage Foundation|website=hispanicheritage.org|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tijerino|first1=Antonio|title=Trumping the Super Youth Vote Too|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumping-the-super-youth-vote-too_us_58a219a7e4b0cd37efcfebc9|accessdate=21 August 2017|issue=13 February 2017|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in a 2016 mock election of upper elementary, middle, and high school students conducted by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]], Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump among the students, with Clinton receiving 46% of the vote, Donald Trump receiving 41%, and other candidates receiving 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=America’s Youth Have Spoken: Hillary Clinton Is Generation Z’s Choice for President|url=http://www.hmhco.com/media-center/press-releases/2016/october/one-vote-2016-results|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Varkey Foundation]] and [[Populus Ltd|Populus]] conducted an international study examining the attitudes of Generation Z in twenty countries. Majorities of those surveyed supported [[same-sex marriage]], [[transgender rights]] and [[gender equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sally|last=Weale|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/08/uk-second-japan-young-people-poor-mental-wellbeing|title=UK second only to Japan for young people's poor mental wellbeing|date=8 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.varkeyfoundation.org/sites/default/files/Global%20Young%20People%20Report%20%28digital%29%20NEW%20%281%29.pdf|publisher=[[Varkey Foundation]]|date=February 2017|title=Generation Z: Global Citizenship Survey|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goldman Sachs]] analysts Robert Boroujerdi and Christopher Wolf describe Generation Z as "more conservative, more money-oriented, more entrepreneurial and pragmatic about money compared with Millennials".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-chart-of-the-generations-and-gen-z-2015-12|title=Goldman Sachs chart of the generations|publisher=Business Insider|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2016 survey published from ''The Gild'', a global brand consultancy, British Gen Zers, defined here as those born 2001 and onwards, are more conservative than Millennials, Gen Xers and Baby Boomers with respect to marijuana legalization, [[transgender]] issues and same sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marcomm.news/gen-z-is-the-most-conservative-generation-since-those-born-before-1945/|title=Gen Z is the most conservative generation since those born before 1945|date=22 October 2016|publisher=Marketing Communication News|accessdate=22 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022215519/http://www.marcomm.news/gen-z-is-the-most-conservative-generation-since-those-born-before-1945/|archivedate=22 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted in 2015 the Center for Generational Kinetics found that American Generation Zers, defined here as those born 1996 and onwards, are less optimistic about the state of the US economy than their generation predecessors, Millennials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genhq.com/igen-gen-z-stance-on-politics-infographic/|title=Infographic: Gen Z Voter and Political Views Election 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[March for Our Lives]], a 2018 [[Demonstration (protest)|demonstration]] following the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]] was  described by [[CNBC]] as an indicator of the political power of Generation Z. Journalist [[Arick Wierson]] stated "politicians from both major parties should take note".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wierson|first1=Arick|title=March for our Lives gun control rally only hints at the political power of Generation Z|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/23/march-for-our-lives-gun-control-rally-only-hints-at-the-political-power-of-generation-z.html|accessdate=24 March 2018|publisher=CNBC|date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A piece titled: ''Dear [[National Rifle Association]]: We Won’t Let You Win, From, Teenagers'' published in March 2018 in ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes Generation Z as the generation after Millennials who will "not forget the elected officials who turned their backs on their duty to protect children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anapol|first1=Avery |title=NJ student march organizers pen op-ed to NRA We Wont Let You Win|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/378333-nj-student-march-organizers-pen-op-ed-to-nra-we-wont-let-you-win|accessdate=24 March 2018|publisher=The Hill|date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dear National Rifle Association: We Won’t Let You Win.

== Employment prospects ==
According to Hal Brotheim in ''Introducing Generation Z'', they will be better future employees.&lt;ref name=Brotheim&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brotheim|first1=Hal|title=Introducing Generation Z|date=2014|publisher=American Jail Association.|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the skills needed to take advantage of advanced technologies, they will be significantly more helpful to the typical company in today's high tech world.&lt;ref name=Brotheim /&gt; Brotheim argues that their valuable characteristics are their acceptance of new ideas and a different conception of freedom from the previous generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=5 Reasons Why Millennial Leaders Need Performance Feedback|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlyfries/2017/09/25/5-reasons-why-millennial-leaders-need-performance-feedback/|accessdate=28 September 2017|date = 22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the technological proficiency they possess, members of Generation Z actually prefer person-to-person contact as opposed to online interaction. As a result of the social media and technology they are accustomed to, Generation Z is well prepared for a global business environment.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Make Way for Generation Z|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/jobs/make-way-for-generation-z.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 28 March 2015|access-date = 22 December 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Alexandra|last = Levit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important note to point out is Generation Z no longer wants just a job: they seek more than that. They want a feeling of fulfillment and excitement in their job that helps move the world forward.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt; Generation Z is eager to be involved in their community and their futures. Before college, Generation Z is already out in their world searching how to take advantage of relevant professional opportunities that will give them experience for the future.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Image:Turkey ancient region map phrygia.gif|thumb|200px|'''Phrygia''' in '''yellow''', the area '''Gordoservon''' was located in]]

In records from [[Bithynia]] in the year 680, the city of '''Gordoservon''' or '''Gordoserbon''' ({{lang-el|Γορδόσερβον}}; [[Proto-Slavic]]: *''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/gordъ|Gordŭ]] [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/sьrbъ|Sĭrbŭ]]''; [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Гордосервон/Gordoservon, Гордосербон/Gordoserbon, Србоград/Srbograd, Град Срба/Grad Srba'' – "City of Serbs") was a [[Byzantine]] city inhabited by [[Serbs]]. The name is derived from the Serbs that [[Asia Minor Slavs|resettled in Asia Minor]] (in ca 649&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Serbian Studies|author=North American Society for Serbian Studies|date=1995|issue=v. 9-10|publisher=North American Society for Serbian Studies|issn=0742-3330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXVpAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 667&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yugoslavs: the history of the Yugoslavs and their states to the creation of Yugoslavia|author=Kostelski, Z.|date=1952|publisher=Philosophical Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuswAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by Byzantine Emperor [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] (641–668), who came from the areas "around the river [[Vardar]]". A "Bishop of Gordoservon" named Isidore is mentioned in 680/681, and the fact that this town was an episcopal seat gives ground to the thesis that it had a large Serbian population. The Serbs were recruited in large numbers into the [[Byzantine army]] especially under [[Justinian II]] in the 680s, until the defection of a 30,000-strong Serbian contingent led to the disastrous loss of the [[Battle of Sebastopolis]] in 692/693.

Around the year 1200&amp;nbsp;AD this city is mentioned as '''Servochoria''' ({{lang-el|Σερβοχώρια}}, "Serbian habitations"). The city was situated where the [[Phrygia]]n kingdom once had been.

'''Henut Taui''', or '''Henuttaui''', '''Henuttawy''' (''[[floruit|fl.]]'' ca 1000 BCE) was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian priestess during the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|21st Dynasty]] whose remains were [[Mummy#The Egyptian mummies|mummified]]. She is mainly known for being one of the so-called "cocaine mummies".

==Background==
Little to nothing is known about her life. She was a priestess and chantress in the [[temple of Amun]] at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and after her death her body was embalmed and buried in the [[Deir el-Bahari]] necropolis.&lt;br&gt;
After the discovery of her tomb, her mummy became a property of the [[king of Bavaria]] (likely [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig I]]), who later donated it to the [[Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst]] of [[Munich]], where it is still located today (ÄS 57).&lt;ref name=rice&gt;Rice, M., ''Who is who in Ancient Egypt'', 1999 (2004), Routledge, London, {{ISBN|0-203-44328-4}}, pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[coffin]], once located at the [[National Archaeology Museum (Lisbon)|National Archaeology Museum of Lisbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Daressy, G., op. cit., p. 19 (see A 136).&lt;/ref&gt; is now in Munich too.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, B. &amp; Moss, R., ''Topographical bibliography of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic texts, reliefs and paintings. I. The Theban necropolis, part 2''. 2nd edition, Oxford University Press 1964, p. 639.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==
{{see also|Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories#Claims of Egyptian coca and tobacco}}
In 1992, German [[toxicologist]] Svetlana Balabanova discovered traces of [[cocaine]], [[hashish]] and [[nicotine]] on Henut Taui's hair as well as on the hair of several others mummies of the museum&lt;ref&gt;Balabanova, S. et al. (1992), "First Identification of Drugs in Egyptian Mummies", ''Naturwissenschaften'' 79, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; which is significant,&lt;ref name=rice/&gt; in that the only source for cocaine and nicotine had been considered to be the [[coca]] and [[tobacco]] plants native to the Americas, and were not thought to have been present in Africa until after [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] voyaged to America.&lt;ref name="Curseof"&gt;"Curse of the Cocaine Mummies" written and directed by Sarah Marris. (Producers: Hilary Lawson, Maureen Lemire and narrated by Hilary Kilberg). A TVF Production for Channel Four in association with the Discovery Channel, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This result was interpreted by theorists and supporters of contacts between [[pre-Columbian]] people and ancient Egyptians, as a proof for their claims. Nevertheless, two successive analysis on other groups of Egyptian mummies and human remains, failed to fully [[Reproducibility|reproduce]] Balabanova's results, showing in fact positive results only for nicotine.&lt;ref name=Rosalie&gt;Counsell, David J. "Intoxicants in Ancient Egypt? Opium, nymphea, coca, and tobacco", in David, Rosalie (ed), ''Egyptian mummies and modern science'', Cambridge University Press 2008, pp. 211-15. {{ISBN|978-0-511-37705-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Curseof"/&gt;

After these experiments, even assuming that cocaine was actually found on mummies, it is possible that this could be a [[contamination]] occurred after the discovery. The same argument can be applied to nicotine but, in addition, various plants other than tobacco are a source of nicotine and two of these, ''[[Withania somnifera]]'' and ''[[Apium graveolens]]'', were known and used by ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref name=Rosalie/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2124">'''Jean Alexandre Buchon''' (21 May 1791 – 29 August 1849) was a [[France|French]] scholar born at [[Menetou-Salon]] (Cher).

Buchon was an ardent [[Liberalism|Liberal]] and took an active part in party struggles under the [[French Restoration|Restoration]], while throwing himself into the historical regeneration then taking place.

{{EB1911 poster|Buchon, Jean Alexandre}}
During 1822 and the succeeding years he travelled about Europe in search of materials for his ''Collection des chroniques nationales françaises écrites en langue vulgaire, du XIe au XVIe siècle'' (4 vols, 1824–1829).

After the [[July Revolution|revolution of 1830]] he founded the ''Pantheon littéraire'', in which he published a ''Choix d'ouvrages mystiques'' (1843), a ''Choix de monuments primitifs de l'église chrêtienne'' (1837), a ''Choix des historiens grecs'' (1837), a collection of ''Chroniques trangres relatives aux expeditions françaises pendant le XIII siècle'' (1840), and, most important of all, a ''Choix de chroniques et mémoires sur l'histoire de France'' (1836–1841).

His travels in southern [[Italy]] and in the East had put him upon the track of the medieval French settlements in those regions, and to this subject he devoted several important works:

*''Recherches et matriaux pour servir d'une histoire de la domination française dans les provinces de membres de l'empire grec'' (1840)
*''Nouvelles recherches historiques sur la principaute française de More et ses hautes baronnies'' (2 vols, 1843–1844)
*''Histoire des conquètes et de l'établissement des Français dans les états de l'ancienne Grèce sous es Villehardouin'' (1846, unfinished)

None of his publications can be described as thoroughly scholarly but they have been of great service to history, and those concerning the East have an especial value of original research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6006">'''Josiah Ober''' is an American historian of ancient Greece and [[classics|classical]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. He is [[Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis|Tsakopoulos]]-[[Markos Kounalakis|Kounalakis]] Professor in honor of [[Constantine Mitsotakis]], and professor of classics and political science, at [[Stanford University]].  His teaching and research links ancient Greek history and philosophy with modern political theory and practice.

==Career==

Ober was educated at the [[University of Minnesota]] (B.A., major in history, 1975) and the [[University of Michigan]] (Ph.D., Department of History, 1980).

He was a professor of ancient history at [[Montana State University - Bozeman|Montana State University]] (1980–1990), and then at [[Princeton University]] (1990–2006).

He has received fellowships from numerous institutions, including the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (1989–90) and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (1997). He delivered the 2002-2003 [[Sigmund H. Danziger, Jr. Memorial Lecture in the Humanities]] at the University of Chicago.

Ober was a student of the distinguished American ancient Greek historian [[Chester Starr]], and has been the teacher of many scholars, such as the classicist John Ma, ancient Greek historian Emily Mackil, and the political theorist Ryan Balot.

His early work has been criticized by scholars such as [[Mogens Herman Hansen]] for overemphasizing the ideological aspect of [[Athenian democracy]] against its institutional dimension,&lt;ref&gt;Described definitively (though not exclusively) by Hansen in his ''The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes: Structure, Principles, and Ideology'', University of Oklahoma Press: New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and his more recent writing has been accused by [[P.J. Rhodes]] of abandoning scholarly impartiality in favour of democratic advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Ancient Democracy and Modern Ideology'', Duckworth: London, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In a long-form review of ''The Rise and Fall of Classical Greece'' for the [[New Left Review]], the classicist Peter Rose concluded that Ober had produced 'an eccentric, at times intriguing, but deeply flawed work of history, which ultimately tells us more about the ideology of the Stanford classics department than it does about ancient Greece'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rose, 'Secrets of the Ancients', New Left Review 103, January-February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On the whole, however, Ober's work has been well received.  For example, Paul Cartledge has called ''Mass and Elite in Democratic Athens'' 'a seminal work',&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Times Higher Education Supplement''.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jennifer Roberts has called ''Political Dissent in Democratic Athens'' 'a major contribution to a dialogue of enormous import'.&lt;ref&gt;In her review of that book in ''The American Journal of Philology'' 121 (2000), 482.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Ober draws on empirical evidence about the ancient world in the service of normative political theory, and in so doing sheds light not just on Athens but on the creation and operation of democratic institutions", writes professor of politics [[Melissa Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://themonkeycage.org/2009/03/20/josiah_obers_democracy_and_kno/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danielle Allen]], classicist and political theorist, also praised Ober's "Democracy and Knowledge' in ''The New Republic'' (2008).

'''Karl''' or '''Carl Richard Lepsius''' (23 December 1810{{nbsp}}&amp;ndash; 10 July 1884) was a pioneering [[Prussia]]n [[Egyptologist]] and [[linguistics|linguist]] and pioneer of [[modern archaeology]].

==Background==
He was born in [[Naumburg|Naumburg an der Saale]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] (Germany), the third son of Friedericke Glaser and Peter Carl Lepsius (1775–1853), Naumburg County Commissioner. Karl Richard's grandfather was Johann August Lepsius (1745–1801), the mayor of [[Naumburg (Saale)|Naumburg upon Saale]].

==Early life==
He studied Greek and Roman [[archaeology]] at the [[University of Leipzig]] (1829&amp;ndash;1830), the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|George Augustus University of Göttingen]] (1830&amp;ndash;1832), and the  [[Frederick William University of Berlin]] (1832&amp;ndash;1833). After receiving his doctorate following his dissertation ''De tabulis Eugubinis'' in 1833, he travelled to [[Paris]], where he attended lectures by the French classicist [[Jean Letronne]], an early disciple of [[Jean-François Champollion]] and his work on the [[decipherment]] of the [[Egyptian language]], visited Egyptian collections all over Europe and studied [[lithography]] and [[engraving]].

==Work==

After the death of Champollion, Lepsius made a systematic study of the French scholar's ''[[Grammaire égyptienne]]'', which had been published posthumously in 1836 but had yet to be widely accepted. In that year, Lepsius travelled to [[Tuscany]] to meet with [[Ippolito Rosellini]], who had led a joint expedition to Egypt with Champollion in 1828-1829. In a series of letters to Rosellini, Lepsius expanded on Champollion's explanation of the use of alphabetic signs in [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] writing, emphasizing (''contra'' Champollion) that [[vowel]]s were not written.

In 1842, Lepsius was commissioned (at the recommendation of the minister of instruction, Johann Eichhorn, and the scientists [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Christian Charles Josias Bunsen]]) by King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederich Wilhelm IV]] of [[Prussia]] to lead an expedition to [[Egypt]] and the [[Sudan]] to explore and record the remains of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian civilization. The Prussian expedition was modelled after the earlier Napoleonic mission, with surveyors, draftsmen, and other specialists.{{sfn|Peck|2001|p=289}}  The mission reached [[Giza]] in November 1842 and spent six months making some of the first scientific studies of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] of Giza, [[Abusir]], [[Saqqara]], and [[Dahshur]].  They discovered 67 pyramids recorded in the pioneering [[Lepsius list of pyramids]] and more than 130 tombs of noblemen in the area.{{sfn|Peck|2001|p=289}}  While at the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], Lepsius inscribed a ''[[graffiti|graffito]]'' written in Egyptian hieroglyphs that honours Friedrich Wilhelm IV above the pyramid's original entrance; it is still visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catchpenny.org/gpglyph.html|title=GP Hieroglyphics}} (photos and translation)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843 he visited [[Naqa]] and copied some of the inscriptions and representations of the temple standing there.&lt;ref name="Bradt"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clammer, Paul|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lvVao2vWnxUC&amp;dq=Naqa+humboldt|title=Sudan|publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]]|year=2005|pages=128–131 | isbn=978-1-84162-114-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working south, stopping for extended periods at important Middle Egyptian sites, such as [[Beni Hasan]] and [[Dayr al-Barsha]], Lepsius reached as far south as [[Khartoum]], and then traveling up the [[Blue Nile]] to the region about [[Sennar]].  After exploring various sites in Upper and Lower [[Nubia]], the expedition worked back north, reaching [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] on November 2, 1844, where they spent four months studying the western bank of the Nile (such as the [[Ramesseum]], [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]], the [[Valley of the Kings]], etc.) and another three on the east bank at  the temples of [[Karnak]] and [[Luxor]], attempting to record as much as possible. Afterwards they stopped at [[Coptos]], the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], and sites in the [[Nile Delta|Egyptian Delta]], such as [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]], before returning to Europe in 1846.

[[File:Lepsius-Projekt tw 1-1-52.jpg|thumb|right|Plates of [[El-Lahun]] and [[Tura (Egypt)|Tura]] from ''Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien'']]
The chief result of this expedition was the publication of ''Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien'' (''Monuments from Egypt and [[Ethiopia]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edoc3.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/lepsius/index.html|title=ULB Halle: Lepsius}}&lt;/ref&gt; a massive twelve volume ''compendia'' of nearly 900 plates of ancient Egyptian inscriptions, as well as accompanying commentary and descriptions. These plans, maps, and drawings of temple and tomb walls remained the chief source of information for Western scholars well into the 20th century, and are useful even today as they are often the sole record of monuments that have since been destroyed or reburied.  For example, he described a "Headless Pyramid" that was subsequently lost until May 2008, when a team led by [[Zahi Hawass]] removed a 25-foot-high sand dune to re-discover the superstructure (base) of a pyramid believed to belong to King [[Menkauhor Kaiu|Menkauhor]].

Upon his return to Europe in 1845, he married Elisabeth Klein in 1846 and was appointed as a professor of Egyptology at Berlin University in the same year, and the co-director of the [[Ägyptisches Museum]] in 1855; after the death of [[Giuseppe Passalacqua]] in 1865, he was director of the museum.  In 1866 Lepsius returned to Egypt, where he discovered the ''[[Decree of Canopus]]'' at [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]], an inscription closely related to the [[Rosetta Stone]], which was likewise written in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ([[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] and [[Demotic Egyptian|demotic]]) and [[Greek language|Greek]].

Lepsius was president of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome from 1867&amp;ndash;1880, and from 1873 until his death in 1884, the head of the [[Royal Library at Berlin]]. He was the editor of the ''Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde'', a fundamental scientific journal for the new field of [[Egyptology]], which remains in print to this day. While at the editorial helm, Lepsius commissioned [[typographer]] Ferdinand Theinhardt (on behalf of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]) to cut the first hieroglyphic [[typeface]], the so-called Theinhardt font, which remains in use today.

Lepsius published widely in the field of Egyptology, and is considered the father of the modern scientific discipline of Egyptology, assuming a role that Champollion might have achieved had he not died so young. Much of his work is fundamental to the field. Indeed, Lepsius even coined the phrase ''Totenbuch'' ("[[Book of the Dead]]"). He was also a leader in the field of African linguistics, though his ideas are now mainly considered to be outdated. Based on his work in the ancient Egyptian language, and his field work in the Sudan, Lepsius  developed a [[Standard Alphabet by Lepsius|Standard Alphabet]] for [[Transliteration|transliterating]] [[African Languages]]; it was published 1855 and revised in 1863. His 1880 ''Nubische Grammatik mit einer Einleitung über die Völker und Sprachen Afrika's'' contains a sketch of African peoples and a classification of African languages, as well as a grammar of the [[Nubian languages]].

==Family==
On 5 July 1846, he married Elisabeth Klein, (1828–1899), daughter of the composer [[Bernhard Klein]] and great-granddaughter of [[Friedrich Nicolai]]. They had six children, including the geologist and Rector of the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]] G. Richard Lepsius (1851–1915), the chemist and director of the Chemical Factory Griesheim Bernhard Lepsius (1854–1934), the portrait painter and member of the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] (as of 1916) [[Reinhold Lepsius]] (1857–1929) and the youngest son [[Johannes Lepsius]], Protestant theologian, humanist and Orientalist.

Lovell-Smith was born at [[Riccarton, New Zealand|Riccarton]], in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, in 1886. She was the third daughter of ten children born to Mary Jane (Jennie) Cumberworth, a former teacher, and her husband, William Sidney Smith, a printer. Both her parents were good friends of [[Kate Sheppard]], a leading New Zealand [[suffragist]], and Lovell-Smith was given "Kate" as her middle name in honour of Sheppard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ngataonga.org.nz/blog/nz-history/it-was-quite-an-exciting-time-election-recollections-by-first-time-women-voters-of-1893/|title=Recollections by first-time women voters of 1893 – Gauge|website=www.ngataonga.org.nz|language=en-US|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovell-Smith attended Riccarton School for her primary school education and was home-schooled as a teenager.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lovell-Smith joined the family printing business, Smith and Anthony Limited, when she was 17 years old. She began as a [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] operator and was later the manager of the retail stationery section.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She joined the Christchurch branch of the [[National Council of Women of New Zealand]] and became secretary in 1918, a position she held until 1927, when she became dominion secretary. In 1930, she attended the quinquennial conference of the [[International Council of Women]] in Vienna, Austria. On her return to New Zealand, Lovell-Smith joined the [[YWCA]] and was appointed general secretary of the [[Timaru]] branch in 1932. In 1937, she moved to [[Dunedin]] and became the general secretary of the Dunedin YWCA, and from 1945 to 1947 she was general secretary for the [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] YWCA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1947, she returned to live in Christchurch and continued her community work: in November 1949 she was made founding president of the [[Soroptimist Club]] of Christchurch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siwellington.org/uploads/4/4/6/8/44688695/information_and_history_s_i_wellington_-_75th_anniversary_booklet.pdf|title=Background and early history of Soroptimist International of Wellington|last=|first=|date=November 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also joined the local women’s unemployment committee, the Canterbury Women’s Club, the [[United Nations Association of New Zealand]] and CORSO. In the 1960s, she edited the journal of the New Zealand branch of the Pan-Pacific and South-East Asia Women’s Association.

She was president of the branch from 1951 to 1955, and in 1956 was appointed a dominion life member. She continued to attend National Council of Women meetings until over the age of 80.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lovell-Smith was also a writer and editor. From 1952 until 1960, she was assistant editor of the National Council of Women’s ''New Zealand Women in Council''; she wrote a history of the Christchurch YWCA, published in 1961, and a history of the Christchurch branch of the National Council of Women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hdl.handle.net/10182/1410|title=Women and Recreation in Aotearoa/New Zealand – an annotated bibliography|last=Simpson|first=Clare|date=February 1991|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lillian Faderman''' (born July 18, 1940) is an [[United States|American]] [[History|historian]] whose books on lesbian history and LGBT history have earned critical praise and awards. ''The New York Times'' named three of her books on its "Notable Books of the Year" list. In addition, ''The Guardian'' named her book, ''Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers,'' one of the Top 10 Books of Radical History.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lillianfaderman.net/|title=Lillian Faderman|website=www.lillianfaderman.net|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Faderman was raised by her mother, Mary, and her aunt, Rae. In 1914, her mother emigrated from a [[shtetl]] in [[Latvia]] to [[New York City|New York]], planning eventually to send for the rest of the family. Her aunt Rae came in 1923, but the rest of the family was killed during [[Hitler]]'s extermination of [[European Jews]], and Mary blamed herself for not being able to rescue them. Her guilt contributed to a serious [[mental illness]] that would profoundly affect her daughter.&lt;ref name="ADVOCATE"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marler |first=Regina |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2003_Feb_18/ai_97726506 |title=Naked History |publisher=The Advocate |date=February 18, 2003 |accessdate=2007-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208181015/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2003_Feb_18/ai_97726506 |archivedate=February 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary and Ray, Faderman's mother and aunt, worked in the [[Clothing industry|garment industry]] for very little money. Lillian was her mother's third pregnancy; her mother (unmarried) aborted the first two pregnancies at Lillian's biological father's request, but insisted on bearing and raising the third. Mary married when Lillian was a teenager and died in 1979, continuing to have a profound influence on her daughter’s life.

==Coming out==
The family moved to [[Los Angeles]] where, with her mother’s encouragement, Lillian took acting classes. She began modeling as a teenager, discovered the [[gay bar]] scene, and eventually met her first girlfriend. Before she graduated from [[high school]], she married a gay man much older than herself—a marriage that lasted less than a year.

==Scholarship==
Faderman studied first at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and later at [[UCLA]]. She was a professor of English at [[California State University, Fresno]] and a visiting professor at [[UCLA]]. She retired in 2007.

==Private life==
She lives with her [[domestic partner|partner]] of forty years (as of 2012), Phyllis Irwin. She has one son, Avrom, who earned a PhD from [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Alexandra J.

Below is the list of '''ancient settlements in Turkey'''. There are innumerable ruins of ancient settlements spread all over the country. While some ruins date back to [[Neolithic]] times, most of them were settlements of [[Hittite Empire|Hittites]], [[Phrygia]]ns, [[Lydians]], [[Ionians]], [[Urartians]], and so on.

== List of settlements ==

In the table below, only the settlements which have articles in this encyclopaedia are shown, with the exception of the following: 
*A few ancient settlements are still in use ([[Adana]], [[Amasya]], [[Ankara]], [[İstanbul]], [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] etc.) These settlements are not included in the list unless separate articles for the ancient sites exist.
*Some ancient settlements which were well documented are known by name, but so far they have not been unearthed and their exact locations are obscure.( For example; [[Washukanni]], the capital of [[Mittani]].)

Politically [[anarchist]], Leier's books have mostly reflected on [[British Columbia]]'s rich history of labour radicalism.  His first book, ''Where the Fraser River Flows: The Industrial Workers of the World in British Columbia'' (1990) deals with the famous syndicalist, working class rebels, while his second, ''Red Flags and Red Tape: The Making of a Labour Bureaucracy'' (University of Toronto Press) deals with the institutionalization of a non-revolutionary labour movement. In ''Rebel Life: The Life and Times of Robert Gosden, Revolutionary, Mystic, Labour Spy'' (1999), Leier examines the life of an [[Industrial Workers of the World]] member (or "Wobbly") turned police labour spy. His fourth book, ''Bakunin: The Creative Passion'' is a biography and political chronicle of the 19th century Russian anarchist, [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and is being published in paperback by Seven Stories Press.

As part of the Graphic History Collective, he helped produce May Day: A Graphic History of Protest," available through the SFU History Department.

A former folk singer, Leier is also known for bringing a [[banjo]] to his history classes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6511">'''Maurice De Wulf''' (1867–1947), a Belgian [[Thomist]] philosopher, professor of philosophy at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]], was one of the pioneers of the [[historiography]] of [[medieval philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Steenberghen, Fernand Van. [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/phlou_0035-3841_1948_num_46_12_4159 "Maurice De Wulf, Historien de la Philosophie Médiévale,"]  ''Revue Philosophique de Louvain,'' Vol. 46(12), 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''History of Medieval Philosophy'' appeared first in 1900 and was followed by many other editions and translations, one them being available today online.

==Life and work==
During the 1920s he taught at [[Harvard]] and his  ''Philosophy and Civilization in the Middle Ages'' was published at Princeton in 1922.

Very early it was noted that "In his ''Histoire de la Philosophie Médievale'', Mr. de Wulf departs from the common view which identifies Scholasticism with Mediaeval philosophy, and discovers in the Middle Ages two antithetical currents: Scholasticism proper, represented by [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]], Albert the Great, etc.; and anti-Scholasticism, of which [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|Scotus Erigena]] is the father, and which is continued by the Catharists, the Albigenses and the Pantheistic schools. Mr. de Wulf's view on this point has not met with a ready acceptance. It has been rejected, among others, by Elie Blanc and [[François Picavet|Picavet]]. Mr. de Wulf, however, still holds the same opinion, and has defended it again in his Introduction à  la Philosophie Neo scolastique."&lt;ref&gt;Perrier J. L., [https://archive.org/stream/revivalofscholas00perrrich#page/n9/mode/2up The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century], New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1909

Maurice De Wulf was a close friend of [[Cardinal Mercier]]. The "De Wulf-Mansion Centre for Ancient and Medieval Philosophy" was founded (1956) at the [[Institute_of_Philosophy,_University_of_Leuven|Institute of Philosophy in Leuven]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5622">'''Nikephoros Bryennios''' (or '''Nicephorus Bryennius; '''[[Greek language|Greek]]: Νικηφόρος Βρυέννιος, ''Nikēphoros Bryennios; ''1062–1137) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] general, statesman and [[historian]]. He was born at Orestias ([[Orestiada]], [[Adrianople]]) in the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology
 By William George Smith [https://books.google.com/books?id=1qMYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA514&amp;dq=Orestias++Macedonia Google Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
His [[Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder|father]] (or possibly grandfather), of the same name, the governor of the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Dyrrhachium]], had revolted against the feeble [[Michael VII]], but had been defeated by the future Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] and was blinded. The son, who was distinguished for his learning, personal beauty, and engaging qualities, gained the favour of Alexios I and the hand of his daughter [[Anna Komnene]], receiving the titles of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and ''[[panhypersebastos]]'' (one of the new dignities introduced by Alexios).

Bryennios successfully defended the [[walls of Constantinople]] against the attacks of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} during the [[First Crusade]] (1097); conducted the peace negotiations between Alexios and Prince [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] (the [[Treaty of Devol]], 1108); and played an important part in the defeat of [[Melikshah]], the [[Sultanate of Rûm|Seljuq sultan of Rûm]], at the [[Battle of Philomelion]] (1117).

After the death of Alexios, he refused to enter into the conspiracy set afoot by his mother-in-law [[Irene Doukaina]] and his wife Anna to depose [[John II Komnenos]], the son of Alexios, and raise him to the throne. His wife attributed his refusal to cowardice, but it seems from certain passages in his own work that he really regarded it as a crime to revolt against the rightful heir; the only reproach that can be brought against him is that he did not nip the conspiracy in the bud. He was on very friendly terms with the new emperor, John II, whom he accompanied on his [[Syria]]n campaign (1137), but was forced by illness to return to Constantinople, where he died in the same year.

==Family==
By his wife Anna Komnene, the ''kaisar'' Nikephoros Bryennios had several children, including:
# Alexios Bryennios Komnenos, ''[[megas doux]]'', {{circa|1102}}–c. 1161/1167
# John Doukas, c. 1103–after 1173
# Eirene Doukaina, c. 1105–?
# Maria Bryennaina Komnene, c. 1107–?

==Writings==
At the suggestion of his mother-in-law, he wrote a history ("Material for a History", {{lang-el|Ὕλη Ἱστορίας or Ὕλη Ἱστοριῶν}}) of the period from 1057 to 1081, from the victory of [[Isaac I Komnenos]] over [[Michael VI]] to the dethronement of [[Nicephorus III|Nikephoros III Botaneiates]] by Alexios I. The work has been described as a family chronicle rather than a history, the object of which was the glorification of the house of [[Comnenus|Komnenos]]. Part of the introduction is probably a later addition.

In addition to information derived from older contemporaries (such as his father and father-in-law), Bryennios made use of the works of [[Michael Psellos]], [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Michael Attaliates|Michael Attaleiates]]. As might be expected, his views are biased by personal considerations and his intimacy with the royal family, which at the same time, however, afforded him unusual facilities for obtaining material. His model was [[Xenophon]], whom he has imitated with a tolerable measure of success; he abstained from an excessive use of [[simile]] and [[metaphor]], and his style is concise and simple.

He died in 1137 before finishing the work. His wife Anna, at the age of 55,&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Tracy|title=Anna Comnena|url=http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/heroine5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; took it upon herself to finish the work, calling the completed work the ''[[Alexiad]]'', today the main source of Byzantine political history from the end of the 11th century to the beginning of the 12th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Frankopan, Introduction to the ''Alexiad'', x–xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orlando Martins''' (8 December 1899 – 25 September 1985) was a pioneering Nigerian film and stage actor. In the late 1940s, he was one of England's most prominent and leading [[Black people|black]] actors,&lt;ref&gt;Harry Levette, "This is Hollywood". ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', 10 September 1949, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a poll conducted in 1947, he was listed among England's top 15 favourite actors.&lt;ref&gt;Al Monroe, "Swinging the News," ''Chicago Defender'', 18 October 1947, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Martins was born in [[Lagos]], Nigeria, to a civil servant father. He was related to the Benjamin Epega family. In 1913 he was enrolled in [[Eko Boys High School]] but dropped out.&lt;ref name=Yoruba365&gt;[http://studiomulero.aroundmaryland.com/orlando-martins-hollywoods-first-yoruba-actor/ "Orlando Martins, Hollywood’s first Yoruba Actor"], Yoruba 365, 12 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]] he served as a stoker on the [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|RMS ''Mauretania'']] to avenge German cruelty to his family. Following the end of the war, he moved to London; on arrival in 1919 he had no source of income and had to look for ways to earn money. Around the same time, the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] was looking for [[Supernumerary actor|"supers"]] at the rate of three shillings per day. Martins joined the theatre and from there took on various theatre jobs to survive. In 1923, [[John Sanger|Sanger]]'s Circus wanted to have someone to display [[pythons]], Martins took the part starting his performing career in the circus. He also worked as a wrestler (known as "Black Butcher Johnson").&lt;ref name=BourneBBF&gt;[[Stephen Bourne (writer)|Stephen Bourne]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=YYaryaqLfd4C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=orlando+martins+black+in+the+british+frame&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y6yxCIbLC-&amp;sig=D9i6EklnCpYRip_zCZl14gOplDA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8r4_UYb-Ce2S0QWN64HYDQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=orlando%20martins%20black%20in%20the%20british%20frame&amp;f=false ''Black in the British Frame: The Black Experience in British Film and Television''], London: Continuum, 2001; chapter 7, "Robert Adams and Orlando Martins: Men of Two Worlds", pp. 76–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1920, Martins was an extra acting with the [[Diaghilev]] ballet company, and was on the tour with the British company of ''[[Show Boat]]'' as a professional singer. He was an extra in silent films, having made his debut in ''[[If Youth But Knew]]'' (1926).&lt;ref name=BourneBBF /&gt;
In the 1930s he went into acting on the London stage,playing [[Boukman]] in ''[[Toussaint L'Ouverture]]'', a 1936 drama by [[C. L. R. James]] that starred the legendary [[Paul Robeson]],&lt;ref&gt;C. L. R. James, Christian Høgsbjerg, Laurent Dubois, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SCAI6lgHuMgC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=%22orlando+martins%22+stevedore&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kJAlxI471H&amp;sig=0Me7W5OhO6ws34G5yzMPw7ekVT4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiN8dTD1KDMAhUKuBoKHa7TC2MQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22orlando%20martins%22%20stevedore&amp;f=false ''Toussaint Louverture: The Story of the Only Successful Slave Revolt in History; A Play in Three Acts''], [[Duke University Press]], 2012, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; with whom Martins had featured in the 1935 film ''[[Sanders of the River]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Orlando Jones," AFI Catalog.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the war, Martins had films roles in ''[[The Man from Morocco]]'' (1945) and in ''[[Men of Two Worlds]]'' (1946), alongside [[Robert Adams (actor)|Robert Adams]], becoming a sought-after character actor who was described by Peter Noble in 1948 as "a tall, powerful figure of a man with a deep bass voice, friendly, hospitable and with a grand sense of humour."&lt;ref name=BourneBBF /&gt; Noble went on to say of Martins: "He is keenly interested in the foundation of a Negro Theatre in London. As he points out: 'If this ever comes into being it will mean not only that Negro talent in every theatre can be shown to the world, but a continuity of employment for this talent which is now going sadly to waste.'"&lt;ref&gt;Peter Noble, ''The Negro In Films'', Skelton Robinson, 1948, p. 178; quoted in Bourne (2001), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

He appears in the 1949 film ''[[The Hasty Heart]]'' (starring [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Patricia Neal]]) playing the African warrior Blossom, which role Martins also undertook in the stage production.&lt;ref name=Yoruba365 /&gt; In the 1950s he made other appearances on the London stage, including in adaptations of ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'' ([[Trafalgar Square Theatre]], 1954), and ''[[The Member of the Wedding]]'' ([[Royal Court Theatre]], 1957), before returning to Lagos in 1959.&lt;ref name=Yoruba365 /&gt; He subsequently took roles in such films as ''[[Killers of Kilimanjaro]]'' (1960), ''[[Call Me Bwana]]'' (1963), ''[[Mister Moses]]'' (1965), and ''[[Kongi's Harvest (film)|Kongi's Harvest]]'' (1970, [[Wole Soyinka]]'s adaptation of his [[Kongi's Harvest|play of the same name]]).

Martins died in 1985 at the age of 85 in Lagos, where he was buried at [[Ikoyi Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=BourneBBF /&gt;

*''Ontology: The Theory of Being'' (1912)

The only book review that [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] ever published, in 1913, was a scathing review of Coffey's ''The Science of Logic''.&lt;ref name="Kerr2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Descombes2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Descombes|title=The Institutions of Meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ScruAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146|date=11 March 2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-41997-1|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wittgenstein1913"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: P.

In his 1903 article ''The Hexahemeron and Science'', Coffey sought to find a middle ground in conflict between natural sciences and the Catholic Church, seeing fault on both sides.&lt;ref name="Privilege2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Privilege|title=Michael Logue and the Catholic Church in Ireland, 1879–1925|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9TJCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64|date=12 February 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-9132-2|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5718">'''Political stagnation''', '''decline''', or '''decadence''' is a condition in which a nation, empire, [[political party]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ze'ev Sternhell]], ''The Founding Myths of Israel'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2009, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; or alliance experiences adverse conditions, ineffective leadership, hesitation, stalemate, or loss of identity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marta Latek]], ''EU-NATO partnership in stagnation'', Briefing Library, European Parliament, 4th September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders may be unable to provide: [[social cohesion]],&lt;ref&gt;Metin Heper, Ahmet Evin, ''State, Democracy and the Military: Turkey in the 1980's'', De Gruyter, 1988, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; an ideological programme,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C.

The era may be marked by unstable coalitions and policy compromises,&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Shalal]], "German Social Democrats Face Pressure over Coalition Talks", Reuters, 22 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; discontinuity of purpose, frequent changes of government, corruption, and denial.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Schenker]], ''Lebanon's Stagnation'', [[The Washington Institute]], 19 December 2012,&lt;/ref&gt;  Conventional politics being seen to fail, there may be an increase in scapegoating, victimization, rioting, rebellion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Abbas Alnasrawi]], ''Arab Nationalism, Oil, and the Political Economy of Dependency'',  Greenwood Publishing, 1991, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; terrorism, attempted [[coup d'etat|coups d'etat]],&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]] editorial: "Ankara's Shame", 21 April 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; assassinations, or other revenge missions. Leaders may see a foreign war as a way out of difficulties, as in the case of [[Austro-Hungary]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Martel]], ''The Myth that Changed the World'', Oxford University Press, 2014, prologue.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==

[[Ibn Khaldun]] observed periods, following 'expansion to the limit', when 'the habit of subservience' generated 'lies, ruses and deceit', and possibly a 'split in the dynasty'.&lt;ref&gt;Muqadimmah, Routledge, 2001, p255&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Kennedy]], 'Great powers in relative decline instinctively respond by spending more on 'security' and thereby…compound their long-term dilemma.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kennedy]], [[The Rise and Fall of The Great Powers]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of an [[ideocracy]], Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn see self-destruction as a factor in ideological stagnation. The ideocracy may split into 'warring camps'. It may be ended by a military coup, as in [[Peronist]] [[Argentina]]. There may be a popular rebellion. The economy may stagnate, as demands exceed ability. There may be external attacks by other states which fear the spread of the ideology,&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'' p149-53&lt;/ref&gt; A further possibility is peaceful erosion. A new generation matures which is less fervent and more tolerant of pluralism. Technological developments and artistic expression (for example, the plays of [[Vaclav Havel]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]) erode faith in the ideology. The leadership become a less-effective self-serving, careerist elite.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslaw Piekalkiewicz and Alfred Penn, ''The Politics of Ideocracy'' p154-61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

According to Bruno S. Sergi,&lt;ref&gt;'Misinterpreting Modern Russia', Bloomsbury, 2011, chapter nine&lt;/ref&gt; Russia experienced 'transformative' leadership under [[Peter the Great]], [[Catherine the Great]], [[Tsar Alexander II]], [[Lenin]] and [[Gorbachev]], but stagnation followed in each case. The USSR is said to have suffered stagnation between the early 1970s and its collapse from 1989 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Katz, ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves'', St Martin's Press, 1997, p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iran]] under [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] stagnated between 1945-1949 when it failed to deal with the communist threat.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Roger Louis]], ''The British Empire in the Middle East, 1945-1951'', Oxford University Press, 1984, chapter three&lt;/ref&gt; His son and successor [[Mohammad Reza Shah]] experienced, according to Andrew Scott Cooper, 'economic slowdown, corruption, youth rebellion, a revolutionary underclass, and pressure for reform'. The Shah relied on his [[White revolution]], repression, and the oil boom, but these all failed to keep his regime in power.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Scott Cooper, ''The Fall of Heaven: the Pahlavis and the final days of Iran'', Henry Holt, 2016, p214&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Callaghan]] and [[Steve Fielding]]&lt;ref&gt;''Interpreting The Labour Party'', [[Manchester University Press]], 2003, p 151&lt;/ref&gt; say that postwar Britain suffered from 'pluralistic stagnation' between 1945–1979 when both parties endorsed the corporatist consensus.

In [[Israel]] adherence to the original socialist ideology,&lt;ref&gt;[[Yakir Plesner]], 'The Political Economy of Israel', [[Middle East Quarterly]], March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and fading hopes for a [[two-state solution]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Dahlia Scheindlin]], 'Israelis now face a fateful choice as hopes for a two=state solution fade', [[The Guardian]], 1/1/2017&lt;/ref&gt; are factors causing stagnation according to commentators.

The '''Pre-Columbian period in Venezuela''' refers to the period before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] in the 16th century, known as the [[Pre-Columbian era]]. It covers the history of what are now known as the [[Indigenous peoples in Venezuela|indigenous peoples of Venezuela]].

[[Archeologist]]s have discovered evidence of the earliest known inhabitants of the Venezuelan area in the form of [[leaf]]-shaped [[Lithic flake|flake]] [[tool]]s, together with [[Cutting|chopping]] and [[Plane (tool)|plano]]&amp;ndash;[[wikt:convex|convex]] [[scraper (archaeology)|scraping]] implements exposed on the high riverine terraces  of the [[Pedregal River]] in western Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Kipfer_2000_91"&gt;
{{Cite book|last=Kipfer|first=Barbara Ann|year=2000

|location=New York|isbn=0-306-46158-7|page=91
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Late Pleistocene]] hunting artifacts, including [[spear]] tips, come from a similar site in northwestern Venezuela known as ''El Jobo''. According to [[radiocarbon dating]], these date from 13,000 to 7000 BC.&lt;ref name="Kipfer_2000_172"&gt;
Kipfer 2000, p. 172.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taima-Taima]], yellow Muaco and El Jobo in Falcón are some of the sites that have yielded archeological material from these times.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Helaine; Isbell, William (Eds.) (2008): Handbook of South American Archaeology  1st ed. 2008. Corr. 2nd printing, XXVI, 1192 p. 430 .{{ISBN|978-0-387-74906-8}}. Pg 433-434&lt;/ref&gt; These groups co-existed with megafauna like [[Megatherium|megatherium]], [[Glyptodontidae|glyptodonts]] and [[toxodon]]ts.

Archaeologists identify a Meso-Indian period from 7000-5000 B.C.to 1000 A.C. In this period, hunters and gatherers of megafauna started to turn to other food sources and established the first tribal structures.

Beginning around 1000 A.C. archaeologists speak of the Neo-Indian period, which ends with the European Conquest and Colony period.

[[File:palafito.jpg|left|thumb|190px|A [[palafito]] like the ones seen by [[Amerigo Vespucci]]]]It is not known how many people lived in Venezuela before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Conquest]]; it may have been around a million people,&lt;ref name=Wunder/&gt; and in addition to today's peoples included groups such as the [[Arawak]]s, [[Kalina people|Caribs]], and [[Timoto-cuicas]]. The number was much reduced after the Conquest, mainly through the spread of new diseases from Europe.&lt;ref name=Wunder&gt;Wunder, Sven (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=n2nQ0A8BmCYC&amp;pg=PA130 Oil wealth and the fate of the forest: a comparative study of eight tropical countries]'', [[Routledge]]. p130.&lt;/ref&gt; There were two main north-south axes of pre-Columbian population, producing [[maize]] in the west and [[manioc]] in the east.&lt;ref name=Wunder/&gt; Large parts of the [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|llanos]] plains were cultivated through a combination of [[slash and burn]] and permanent settled agriculture.&lt;ref name=Wunder/&gt; The indigenous peoples of Venezuela had already encountered crude [[oil]]s and asphalts that seeped up through the ground to the surface.  Known to the locals as ''mene'', the thick, black liquid was primarily used for medicinal purposes, as an illumination source, and for the caulking of canoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Chronology of Venezuelan Oil | year=1969 | publisher=Purnell and Sons LTD | author=Anibal Martinez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century when [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] began in Venezuelan territory, the population of several [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] such as the [[Mariches]] (descendants of the [[Kalina people|Caribes]]) declined. Native [[cacique]]s (leaders) such as [[Guaicaipuro]] (c. 1530–1568) and [[Tamanaco]] (died 1573) attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them. The founder of [[Caracas]], [[Diego de Losada]], ultimately put Tamanaco to death.&lt;ref name="UNE"&gt;

'''The Australian Ballet''' is the largest [[classical ballet]] company in Australia. It was founded by [[J. C. Williamson]] Theatres Ltd. and the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust]] in 1962, with the English-born dancer, teacher, repetiteur and director [[Peggy van Praagh|Dame Peggy van Praagh]] as founding artistic director. Today, it is recognised as one of the world's major international ballet companies.

==History==
The roots of the Australian Ballet can be found in the [[Edouard Borovansky#Borovansky Ballet|Borovansky Ballet]], a company founded in 1940 by the [[Czech people|Czech]] dancer [[Edouard Borovansky]]. Borovansky had been a dancer in the touring ballet company of the famous [[Russia]]n ballerina [[Anna Pavlova]] and, after visiting Australia on tour with the Covent Garden Russian Ballet, he decided to remain in Australia, establishing a ballet school in [[Melbourne]] in 1939, out of which he developed a performance group which became the Borovansky Ballet. The company was supported and funded by J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd from 1944. Following Borovansky's death in 1959, the English dancer and administrator [[Peggy van Praagh|Dame Peggy van Praagh]] was invited to become artistic director of the company. J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd decided to disband the Borovansky Ballet in 1961.

In 1961, J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd and the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust]] received federal subsidies towards the establishment of a national ballet company. These organisations established the Australian Ballet Foundation to assist with the establishment of a new company, which in 1962 became the Australian Ballet. Peggy van Praagh, who had been kept on a retainer by J. C. Williamson Theatres Ltd through the intervening year between the disbanding of the Borovansky Ballet and the establishment of the Australian Ballet, was invited to become the founding artistic director of the company. The majority of the dancers employed by the fledgling company were drawn from former members of the Borovansky Ballet.

The first performance by the Australian Ballet was [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', staged at [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney]] on 2 November 1962. The principal dancers in the first season were [[Kathleen Gorham]], [[Marilyn Jones]] and [[Garth Welch]]. Van Praagh also invited the Royal Ballet's Ray Powell to temporarily became the company's first ballet master, with Leon Kellaway (brother of [[Cecil Kellaway]]), a former dancer with the Covent Garden Russian Ballet, as the company's first ballet teacher. In later years [[Sir]] [[Robert Helpmann]], Marilyn Jones and [[Maina Gielgud]] made major contributions as Artistic Directors of the Australian Ballet.

In 1964 van Praagh established the [[Australian Ballet School]], which was formed specially to train dancers for the company and remains the company's associate school to this day. Dame Margaret Scott was the founding director of the school, followed by [[Gailene Stock]] [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]], [[Marilyn Rowe]] [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], and now Lisa Pavane, all three former company principal artists.

==Present==
Today the company is based in [[Melbourne]]; its [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]] headquarters is the Primrose Potter Australian Ballet Centre, named after its long term supporter [[Primrose Potter|Lady (Primrose) Potter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianballet.com.au/watch_listen/photo_galleries/lady_primrose_potter Australian Ballet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320111617/http://www.australianballet.com.au/watch_listen/photo_galleries/lady_primrose_potter |date=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianballet.com.au/about_us/corporate_information/australian_ballet_centre Australian Ballet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421131342/http://www.australianballet.com.au/about_us/corporate_information/australian_ballet_centre |date=21 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company regularly tours to mainland state capital cities within Australia, with lengthy seasons in Melbourne at the [[The Arts Centre (Melbourne)|State Theatre]] (accompanied by [[Orchestra Victoria]]) and in [[Sydney]] at the [[Sydney Opera House]] accompanied by the [[Australian Opera &amp; Ballet Orchestra]]. Other regular venues are the Lyric Theatre at the [[Queensland Performing Arts Centre]] in [[Brisbane]], and the Adelaide Festival Centre in [[Adelaide]]. The company also tours internationally, and performs annually in an intimate outdoor setting on [[Hamilton Island (Queensland)|Hamilton Island]].&lt;ref name="qualia"/&gt;

The Australian Ballet works in close cooperation with the [[Australian Ballet School]], of which many of the company's dancers are graduates. Giving approximately 200 performances a year, the Australian Ballet claims to be the busiest ballet company in the world. With a vast repertoire which includes the major classical and heritage works as well as contemporary productions, it follows its artistic vision of "Caring for Tradition, Daring to be Different". Each year, the company also presents an extensive national education programme, run by Colin Peasley a former Principal Dancer with the company, to further inspire and educate its audiences. Its Dance Education Ensemble visits more than eighty primary schools per year to introduce young pupils to classical ballet and other types of dance.&lt;ref name="Mulready-2012"/&gt;

Box office sales, derived from its strong and loyal audience base, are the foundation of the company's income stream. The Australian Ballet also receives funding from the [[Government of Australia|Australian]], [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] and [[Government of New South Wales|New South Wales]] governments, corporate sponsors, private donors and bequests.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The company's current artistic director is [[David McAllister (dancer)|David McAllister]] [[Order of Australia|AM]], who was a principal dancer until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecultureconcept.com/the-australian-ballet-%E2%80%93-legendary-dance-liaisons|title=The Australian Ballet – Legendary Dance Liaisons|work=The Culture Concept Circle|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's previous artistic directors were: [[Ross Stretton]] (1996–2001); [[Maina Gielgud]] (1983–96); [[Marilyn Jones]] (1979–82); Anne Woolliams (1976–77); [[Robert Helpmann|Sir Robert Helpmann]] (1965–76) and the founding artistic director, Dame Peggy van Praagh (1962–74; 1978).{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The most recent appointment to the position of executive director (July 2013) is Libby Christie, former Managing Director of the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]]. Her predecessor was Valerie Wilder, who succeeded Richard Evans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The Music Director and chief conductor of The Australian Ballet since 2003 has been [[Nicolette Fraillon]], the world's only woman chief conductor of a ballet company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/nicolette-fraillon-calls-out-sexism-in-classical-music-world/7493936 Jeremy Story Carter, "Australian Ballet music director calls out sexism in classical music world", ABC Radio National, 13 June 2016].

== Book summary ==

Sand began his work by looking for research studies about forcible exile of Jews from the area now bordered by modern Israel, and its surrounding regions. He was astonished that he could find no such literature, he says, given that the expulsion of Jews from the region is viewed as a constitutive event in [[Jewish history]]. The conclusion he came to from his subsequent investigation is that the expulsion simply did not happen, that no one exiled the Jewish people from the region, and that the [[Jewish diaspora]] is essentially a modern invention. He accounts for the appearance of [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|millions of Jews around the Mediterranean]] and elsewhere as something that came about primarily through the [[Proselytes|religious conversion of local people]], saying that Judaism, contrary to popular opinion, was very much a "converting religion" in former times. He holds that mass conversions were first brought about by the [[Hasmonean]]s under the influence of [[Hellenization|Hellenism]], and continued until [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christianity rose to dominance in the fourth century CE]].&lt;ref name="Ilani" /&gt;

===Jewish origins===

Sand argues that it is likely that the ancestry of most contemporary Jews stems mainly from outside the [[Land of Israel]] and that a "nation-race" of Jews with a common origin never existed, and that just as most Christians and Muslims are the progeny of converted people, not of the first Christians and Muslims, Jews are also descended from converts. According to Sand, Judaism was originally, like its two cousins, a [[Proselytism|proselytising]] religion, and mass conversions to Judaism occurred among the [[Khazars]] in the Caucasus, [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes in North Africa, and in the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] of the Arabian Peninsula.

According to Sand, the original Jews living in Israel, contrary to popular belief, were not exiled by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] following the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]].&lt;ref name="Ilani" /&gt; The Romans permitted most Jews to remain in the country. Rather, the story of the exile was a myth promoted by early Christians to recruit Jews to the new faith. They portrayed that event as a divine punishment imposed on the Jews for having [[Rejection of Jesus|rejected the Christian gospel]]. Sand writes that "Christians wanted later generations of Jews to believe that their ancestors had been exiled as a punishment from God."&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt; Following the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest of Palestine]] in the 7th century, many local Jews converted to [[Islam]] and were assimilated among the Arab conquerors. Sand concludes that these converts are the ancestors of the contemporary [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]].&lt;ref name="Segev" /&gt;

===Jewish peoplehood===

Sand's explanation of the birth of the "myth" of a Jewish people as a group with a common, ethnic origin has been summarized as follows: "[a]t a certain stage in the 19th century intellectuals of Jewish origin in Germany, influenced by the folk character of [[German nationalism]], took upon themselves the task of inventing a people "retrospectively," out of a thirst to create a modern Jewish people. From historian [[Heinrich Graetz]] on, Jewish historians began to draw the history of Judaism as the history of a nation that had been a kingdom, became a wandering people and ultimately turned around and went back to its birthplace."&lt;ref name="Ilani" /&gt;

In this, Sand writes, they were similar to other nationalist movements in Europe at the time that sought the reassurance of a [[Golden Age]] in their past to prove they have existed as a separate people since the beginnings of history. Jewish people found theirs in what he calls "the mythical Kingdom of [[David]]". Before this invention, he says, Jews thought of themselves as Jews because they [[Judaism|shared a common religion]], not a common ethnic background.&lt;ref name="Ilani" /&gt;

===Return from exile, Zionism===

Sand believes that the idea of Jews being obliged to return from exile to the [[Promised Land]] was alien to Judaism before the birth of [[Zionism]], and that the holy places were seen as places to long for, not to be lived in. On the contrary, for 2,000 years Jews stayed away from Jerusalem because their religion forbade them from returning until the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] came. According to Sand, the ancestry of Central and Eastern European Jews stems heavily from mediæval Turkic [[Khazars]] who were converted to [[Judaism]], a theory which was popularized in a book written by [[Arthur Koestler]] in 1976.&lt;ref name = "Goldstein" /&gt;

===Overall intent of the book===

Sand explained during a newspaper interview his reasons for writing the book: "I wrote the book for a double purpose. First, as an Israeli, to democratise the state; to make it a real republic. Second, I wrote the book against Jewish essentialism."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Shlomo Sand: an enemy of the Jewish people? [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/17/shlomo-sand-judaism-israel-jewish]" Retrieved 2011-01-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sand explained in the same interview that what he means by 'Jewish [[essentialism]]' is, in the words of the interviewer, "the tendency in modern Judaism to make shared ethnicity the basis for faith."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; "That is dangerous and it nourishes antisemitism. I am trying to normalise the Jewish presence in history and contemporary life," Sand said.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

==Reception==
Sand's book has provoked a range of responses from different points of view.

===As a work of history===
Writing in [[The Financial Times]], British historian [[Tony Judt]] commented, "Shlomo Sand has written a remarkable book. In cool, scholarly prose he has, quite simply, normalized Jewish history." He states that he is untroubled by the book's historical perspective, and that "Sand – for example in his emphasis upon the conversions and ethnic mixing that characterise the Jews in earlier times – is telling us nothing we do not already know."&lt;ref name=Judt20091207&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a commentary published in ''[[Haaretz]]'', [[Israel Bartal]], dean of the humanities faculty of the [[Hebrew University]], writes that Sand's claims about Zionist and contemporary Israeli historiography are baseless, calling the work "bizarre and incoherent," and that Sand's "…treatment of Jewish sources is embarrassing and humiliating."&lt;ref name=Bartal/&gt; According to Bartal, "No historian of the Jewish national movement has ever really believed that the origins of the Jews are ethnically and biologically 'pure'." Bartal writes that Sand applies academically marginal positions to the entire body of Jewish historiography and, in doing so, "denies the existence of the central positions in Jewish historical scholarship." Sand, for example, does not mention the fact that, from 2000 onwards, a team of scholars from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem labored on the production of a three-volume study on the history of the Jews of Russia.&lt;ref name=kulik /&gt; He adds that "the kind of political intervention Sand is talking about, namely, a deliberate program designed to make Israelis forget the true biological origins of the Jews of Poland and Russia or a directive for the promotion of the story of the Jews' exile from their homeland is pure fantasy."&lt;ref name = "Bartal" /&gt;

In a review, [[Washington Post]] journalist [[David Finkel]] writes that the book's chapter on 'Mythistory' is "where Sand fully hits his stride. It is not so much Jewish history but rather historiography that's decisive ..." Finkel writes that [[Israel Bartal|Bartal]] "disputes little of Sands’ history but focuses on his historiography," and suggests, "doesn’t all this precisely prove Sand’s point? The professional intellectuals ... have no need for crude myths. Yet this does not prevent every Israeli government, right, center or 'left', through which many of these same intellectuals may rotate as ministers, advisors or spokespersons, from justifying land grabs, settlements and demolition of Palestinian homes all over 'Greater Jerusalem' under the banner of 'the eternal capital of the Jewish people.'"&lt;ref&gt;Myths of the Exile and Return: The History of History, David Finkel, May–June 2010. [http://www.solidarity-us.org/current/node/2805]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critic of the book has called it, in part, a recycled version of ''[[The Thirteenth Tribe]]'', another book with a controversial thesis on the genesis of the Jewish people published in 1976 by  [[Arthur Koestler]]. "'The Thirteenth Tribe' was received coolly by critics, and Mr. Sand's repackaging of its central argument has not fared much better," commented Evan R. Goldstein.&lt;ref name = "Goldstein" /&gt;  There is not enough known about the 13th century demography of Eastern European Jews to credibly make as bold a claim as Sand's.&lt;ref name="Goldstein" /&gt;

Historian [[Anita Shapira]] criticizes Sand for regularly "grab(bing) at the most unorthodox theory" in a field and then stretching it "to the outer limits of logic and beyond" during Sand's survey of three thousand years of history.&lt;ref name="Shapira" /&gt; Shapira says that the Sand's political program makes the book an attempt to "drag history into a topical argument, and with the help of misrepresentations and half-truths to adapt it to the needs of a political discussion."&lt;ref name="Shapira" /&gt;

[[Carlo Strenger]] writes that Sand's book is "not a pure work of history" and argues that, "in fact, it has a clearly stated political agenda. ... It might come as a surprise to some who have not read the book that Sand's goal is to preserve Israel as a democracy with a Jewish character based on a Jewish majority."&lt;ref name=Strenger&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlo Strenge|title=Shlomo Sand's 'The Invention of the Jewish People' is a success for Israel|url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/strenger-than-fiction/shlomo-sand-s-the-invention-of-the-jewish-people-is-a-success-for-israel-1.3247|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Shaul Stampfer]], "even though it's a wonderful story", the mass conversion of Khazars to Judaism never took place.&lt;ref name = "Haatz Stampfer"&gt;{{Cite news |last = Aderet |first = Ofer |date = 26 June 2014 |title = Jews are not descended from Khazars, Hebrew University historian says |url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/1.601287 |work = haaretz.com |accessdate= 1 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Daniel Lazare the Invention of Jewish people is  "messy polemic – helter-skelter, tendentious and ill-informed". Accoriding to Lazare, Sand "rightly insists on the relevance of the ancient past to contemporary politics, but his distortions are an obstacle to a full understanding of the modern Israeli-Palestinian predicament."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n12/daniel-lazare/a-diverse-collection-of-peoples&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Michael Berkowitz]] from [[University College London]] wrote "With a little critical distance, it is possible to criticize this book as a far cry from a ‘real’ work of scholarship.  It is flimsy, haphazardly built, slap-dash. There is no foundation in archival research, and Sand does not seem to have fully read (or understood) many of the secondary works on which his thesis relies.  He apparently has never heard of [[Aviel Roshwald]] and [[George Mosse]], who are among the first names that should spring to mind in any consideration of Jews and nationalism... Perhaps the fundamental problem with this book, which also applies to the above-mentioned works of Goldhagen, Piterberg, and Mayer, is that the thesis runs way ahead of the supposedly dispassionate investigation (despite Sand’s protest to the contrary), and therefore the book assumes the character more of a legal brief than a scholarly monograph". Berkowitz criticized it as "a far cry from a ‘real’ work of scholarship" and "plodding and dull."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/973|title=The Invention of the Jewish People book review|last=Berkowitz|first=Michael|date=October 2010|work=Revies in History|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an argument about Jewish identity===
Writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[Hillel Halkin]] calls assertions made in the book&lt;!-- what assertion? --&gt; "the exact opposite of the truth" and goes on to say that "Believing Jews throughout the ages have never doubted for a moment that they belonged to an am yisra'el, a people of Israel—nor, in modern times, have non-believing Jews with strong Jewish identities. It is precisely this that constitutes such an identity. Far from inventing Jewish peoplehood, Zionism was a modern re-conceptualization of it that was based on its long-standing prior existence."&lt;ref&gt;Indecent Proposal, Hillel Halkin, Jan. 9, 2010, ''The New Republic'', [The Invention of the Jewish People. [http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/indecent-proposal]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Israeli historian [[Tom Segev]] writes that Sand's book "is intended to promote the idea that Israel should be a 'state of all its citizens' – Jews, Arabs and others – in contrast to its declared identity as a '[[Jewish and democratic state|Jewish and democratic]]' state."&lt;ref name="Segev" /&gt; Segev adds that the book includes "numerous facts and insights that many Israelis will be astonished to read for the first time".&lt;ref name="Segev"/&gt;

British historian [[Simon Schama]], reviewing the book in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', argues that Sand misunderstands Jews in the diaspora, specifically, that he thinks that "the [[Khazars]], the [[central Asian]] kingdom which, around the 10th century, converted to [[Judaism]] have been excised from the master narrative because of the embarrassing implication that present day Jews might be descended from [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] converts."&lt;ref name = "Schama" /&gt; Schama states that, on the contrary, when he was a child, "the Khazars were known by every Jewish girl and boy in my neck of [[Golders Green]]ery and further flung parts of the diaspora, and celebrated rather than evaded."&lt;ref name = "Schama" /&gt; Schama adds that "Sand's sense of grievance against the myths on which the exclusively Jewish right to full Israeli immigration is grounded is one that many who want to see a more liberal and secular Israel wholeheartedly share. But his book prosecutes these aims through a sensationalist assertion that somehow, the truth about Jewish culture and history, especially the 'exile which never happened,' has been suppressed in the interests of racially pure demands of Zionist orthodoxy. This, to put it mildly, is a stretch."&lt;ref name = "Schama" /&gt;

Sand responded to Schama's critique on his website by summarising the methodology Schama had used: "One of the most effective techniques adopted to ridicule or marginalize one’s ideological opponents is to create a caricatured and extreme version of their thesis. Some Zionist historians have become past masters with such methods and Simon Schama seems to want to emulate them in his review of my book."&lt;ref name = "SandResponse" /&gt;

British historian [[Max Hastings]], in his review for the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', writes that the book "represents, at the very least, a formidable polemic against claims that Israel has a moral right to define itself as an explicitly and exclusively Jewish society, in which non-Jews, such as Palestino-Israelis, are culturally and politically marginalised." He adds that Sand "rightly deplores the eagerness of fanatics to insist upon the historical truth of events convenient to modern politics, in defiance of evidence or probability... Yet Sand, whose title is foolishly provocative, displays a lack of compassion for the Jewish predicament." Hastings continues, stating that "It is possible to accept his view that there is no common genetic link either between the world's Jews or to the ancient tribes of Israel, while also trusting the evidence of one's own senses that there are remarkable common Jewish characteristics — indeed, a Jewish genius — that cannot be explained merely by religion." Hastings states that "Sand produces some formidable arguments about what Jews may not be, but he fails to explain what it is they are." Hastings concludes that Sand's book "serves notice on Zionist traditionalists: if an Israeli historian can display such plausible doubts about important aspects of the Israeli legend, any Arabs hostile to the state of Israel can exploit a fertile field indeed."&lt;ref name = "Hastings"/&gt;

[[Center for Advanced Judaic Studies|Steven Weitzman]], himself the author of a recent analysis of the topic which dismisses many of the key traditional accounts of Jewish origins, critiques Sand's idea of a deliberate 'invention' of Jewish identity, while arguing that Sand’s method has similarities to  mainstream scholarship. For Weitzman, Sand has just replaced one origin theory with another, whereas, for Weitzman, the question of Jewish origins is to an extent indeterminate (‘unresolvable’).&lt;ref&gt;Steven Weitzman [https://books.google.com/books?id=P_uhDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320  ''The Origin of the Jews: The Quest for Roots in a Rootless Age.''], Princeton University Press, 2017 pp.206-207,320&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up  exchange with [[Shmuel Rosner]] he adds that his criticism of Sand applies equally to versions of the origin stories produced by the right. Making a comparison already voiced elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.i24news.tv/fr/actu/israel/148619-170623-un-livre-vide-sur-l-histoire-du-peuple-palestinien-meilleure-vente-sur-amazon 'Un livre vide sur "l'histoire du peuple palestinien", meilleure vente sur Amazon,'] [[i24news]] 24 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; he compares Sand's book to [[Assaf Voll]]'s [[A History of the Palestinian People]], 122 blank pages, stating Sand's argument is the reverse of Voll's, with the former attempting to disprove Jewish origins, and the latter, doing the same for Palestinians, each undermining an adversary's national claim.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Roser, Steven Weitzman, [http://jewishjournal.com/rosnersdomain/221214/origins-jews-exchange-part-2-gaps-jewish-public-scholars/ 'The Origins of the Jews exchange, part 2: On the gaps between the Jewish public and the scholars,'], [[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]],  5 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an argument about the position of "Jewish history" in Israeli universities===
According to Ilani, most of Sand's book deals with the question of where the Jews come from, rather than questions of modern Jewish nationalism and the modern invention — according to Sand — of the Jewish people."&lt;ref name="Ilani" /&gt; Therefore, some historians of Judaism have stated that Sand is dealing with subjects about which he has no understanding, and that he bases his book on work that he is incapable of reading in the original languages.&lt;ref name="Ilani" /&gt;

Sand admits that he is "a historian of France and Europe, and not of the ancient period…"&lt;ref name="Ilani" /&gt; and that he has "been criticized in Israel for writing about Jewish history when European history is my specialty. But a book like this needed a historian who is familiar with the standard concepts of historical inquiry used by academia in the rest of the world."&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt; This cannot be found in university history departments in Israel, because of their isolated nature. This isolation, Sand states, dates to a decision in the 1930s to separate history into two disciplines: general history and Jewish history. Jewish history was assumed to need its own field of study because Jewish experience was considered unique.

"There is no Jewish department of politics or sociology at the universities. Only history is taught this way, and it has allowed specialists in Jewish history to live in a very insular and conservative world where they are not touched by modern developments in historical research."&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt;

===Genetic evidence===
{{see|Genetic studies of Jewish origins|Khazar theory of Ashkenazi ancestry}}
 
Sand's book has occasionally been mentioned in the press in the context of studies in Jewish population genetics. 
This has been the case in June 2010, as the popular press reported on two studies in this field, 
(Atzmon et al.,  ''American Journal of Human Genetics'' and Beha et al., ''Nature'').

Thus, ''[[Newsweek]]'' mentions Sand's book as having "revived" debate on the [[Khazars|Khazar]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Begley"&gt;{{cite web

and the ''[[New York Times]]'' said the studies "refute the suggestion made last year by the historian Shlomo Sand in his book ''The Invention of the Jewish People'' that Jews have no common origin but are a miscellany of people in Europe and Central Asia who converted to Judaism at various times."&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;{{cite news

Michael Balter, reviewing the study in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', says the following:
{{blockquote|… Shlomo Sand of Tel Aviv University in Israel argues in his book ''The Invention of the Jewish People,'' translated into English last year, that most modern Jews do not descend from the ancient Land of Israel but from groups that took on Jewish identities long afterward.
Nevertheless, the study by [[Harry Ostrer|Ostrer]]'s group concluded that all three Jewish groups—Middle Eastern, Sephardic, and Ashkenazi—share genomewide genetic markers that distinguish them from other worldwide populations.&lt;ref name="science"/&gt;}}

Geneticist [[Harry Ostrer]] presented findings that were generally viewed as disproving Sand's notion that the Jewish people is an ex-post invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legacy: A Genetic History of the Jewish People|last=Ostrer|first=Harry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780195379617|location=Oxford|pages=210, 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/99494/a-case-for-genetic-jewishness|title=Review: Geneticist Harry Ostrer’s ‘Legacy’ Finds a Biological Basis for Jewishness|last=Oransky|first=Oransky|date=2012-05-15|website=Tablet Magazine|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ostrer said, "I would hope that these observations would put the idea that Jewishness is just a cultural construct to rest."  Balter's article further cites Noah Rosenberg of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, as saying that although the study "does not appear to support" the Khazar hypothesis, it "doesn't entirely eliminate it either."&lt;ref name="science"/&gt;

Shlomo Sand has contested the claim that his book has been contradicted by recent genetic research published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' journal and the ''[[American Journal of Human Genetics]]''. In a new afterword for the paperback edition of ''The Invention of the Jewish People'', Sand writes:

{{blockquote|This attempt to justify Zionism through genetics is reminiscent of the procedures of late nineteenth-century anthropologists who very scientifically set out to discover the specific characteristics of Europeans. As of today, no study based on anonymous DNA samples has succeeded in identifying a genetic marker specific to Jews, and it is not likely that any study ever will. It is a bitter irony to see the descendants of [[Holocaust]] survivors set out to find a biological Jewish identity: Hitler would certainly have been very pleased! And it is all the more repulsive that this kind of research should be conducted in a state that has waged for years a declared policy of "Judaization of the country" in which even today a Jew is not allowed to marry a non-Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://inventionofthejewishpeople.com/2010/06/new-york-times-on-sand-and-jewish-origins/#more-641| title = New York Times on Sand and Jewish Origins| author = Sand, Shlomo| date = 2010-06-10| accessdate = 2010-07-05| publisher = inventionofthejewishpeople.com| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100715134446/http://inventionofthejewishpeople.com/2010/06/new-york-times-on-sand-and-jewish-origins/#more-641| archivedate = 2010-07-15| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another study on European Jewish population genetics was published in 2012 (Elhaik et al.).
According to his study's conclusions, European Jews derive from Caucasus and Mesopotamian populations.&lt;ref name="gbe.oxfordjournals.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aderet |first=Ofer |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/the-jewish-people-s-ultimate-treasure-hunt.premium-1.490539 |title=The Jewish people's ultimate treasure hunt - Israel News &amp;#124; Haaretz Daily Newspaper |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2012-12-28 |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eran Elhaik1,2 |url=http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/12/14/gbe.evs119.short?rss=1 |title=The Missing Link of Jewish European Ancestry: Contrasting the Rhineland and the Khazarian Hypotheses |publisher=Gbe.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the publication of Elhaik's study, ''Haaretz'' reported comments by Sand, who took Elhaik's paper as a vindication of his ideas and seized the opportunity to criticize again "geneticists looking for Jewish genes", expressing the suspicion that the findings of prior geneticists may have been "adapted" for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;"Some people, historians and even scientists, turn a blind eye to the truth. Once to say Jews were a race was anti-Semitic, now to say they're not a race is anti-Semitic. It's crazy how history plays with us." Shlomo Sand cited Danielle Venton, [http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/75.full9 'Highlight: Out of Khazaria—Evidence for “Jewish Genome” Lacking,'] in ''Genome Biology and Evolution,'' Vol.5, Issue 1, 2013 pp.75-6.&lt;/ref&gt; 
As in historical research so in genetics, he argues: "It is very easy to showcase certain findings while marginalizing others and to present your study as scholarly research."&lt;ref&gt;Ofer Aderet, [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/the-jewish-people-s-ultimate-treasure-hunt.premium-1.490539 'The Jewish people's ultimate treasure hunt,'] at ''[[Haaretz]]'', 28 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some geneticists conducting studies in Jewish genetics have challenged Elhaik's methods. Michael Hammer, a geneticist at the University of Arizona, called one of Elhaik's underlying assumptions "unrealistic",  reasoning that Armenians have Middle Eastern roots, which, he says, is why they appeared to be genetically related to Ashkenazi Jews in Elhaik’s study. And described Elhaik and other proponents of the Khazarian hypothesis as "outlier folks ... who have a minority view that's not supported scientifically."&lt;ref name=rubin&gt;Rita Rubin, [http://forward.com/news/israel/175912/jews-a-race-genetic-theory-comes-under-fierce-atta/?p=all 'Jews a Race' Genetic Theory Comes Under Fierce Attack by DNA Expert,']. ''[[The Forward]]'', 7 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Feldman]], a geneticist at Stanford University and director of its Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies, agrees: "If you take all of the careful genetic population analysis that has been done over the last 15 years, ... there's no doubt about the common Middle Eastern origin" of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name=rubin/&gt; [[Dan Graur]], professor of molecular evolution at the University of Houston and Elihak's doctoral supervisor, called Elhaik's conclusion that Ashkenazi Jews originated in the Caucasus region and not the Middle East "a very honest estimate" and said Elhaik "writes more provocatively than may be needed, but it's his style."&lt;ref name=rubin/&gt;

'''Tiit Aleksejev''' (born 6 July 1968) is an [[Estonia]]n novelist and playwright.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euprizeliterature.eu/node/79 Profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202055536/http://www.euprizeliterature.eu/node/79 |date=2014-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleksejev was born in [[Kohtla-Järve]]. He studied history at the [[University of Tartu]], and served as a diplomat in France and Belgium.

His [[debut novel]] was a thriller called ''Valge kuningriik'' (''The White Kingdom'', 2006). It won the [[Betti Alver Prize]] for best first novel. His second novel was a work of historical fiction, set in the time of the [[First Crusade]]. This novel called ''Palveränd'' (''The Pilgrimage'', 2008) won the [[EU Prize for Literature]] and was translated into several languages subsequently (e.g. Italian, Hungarian, and Finnish). In 2011, he published a third novel ''Kindel linn'' (''Stronghold''). ''Palveränd'' and ''Kindel linn'' are the first and second part of what is to become a trilogy.

His first play ''Leegionärid'' (''Legionaries''), about the fallen soldiers of the [[Estonian Legion]], appeared in 2010 and premiered in 2013 in [[Rakvere]]. It received the [[Virumaa Literary Award]] in 2011. Another historical play, ''Kuningad'' (''Kings'') was published in 2014 and is about the murder of the four Estonian kings during the [[St. George's Night Uprising]] (1343).

Aleksejev lives in [[Tallinn]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7632">'''Transmodernism''' is a philosophical and cultural movement which was founded by [[Argentina|Argentinian]]-[[Mexico|Mexican]] [[philosopher]] [[Enrique Dussel]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Cole, Mike. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PqIUx9uOMTAC&amp;dq=transmodernism&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions] Psychology Press, 2008, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; A critic of postmodernism, he instead refers to himself as a transmodernist and wrote a series of [[essay]]s criticising the postmodern theory and advocating a transmodern way of thinking. Transmodernism is a development in thought following the periodisation of [[postmodernism]]; as a movement, it also develops from [[modernism]], and, in turn, critiques modernity and postmodernity,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; viewing them as the end of modernism. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmodernism is influenced by a great deal of philosophical movements. Its emphasis on [[spirituality]] can be said to have been influenced by the many [[esoteric]] movements during the [[Renaissance]]. Transmodernism is also highly influenced by [[transcendentalism]] and idealises different figures from mid-19th century [[United States]], most notably [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Transmodernism also seems to be related to different aspects of [[Marxism|Marxist]] philosophy, having much common ground with dissident [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[liberation theology]].&lt;ref name="Cole, Mike 2008, p. 69"&gt;Cole, Mike. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PqIUx9uOMTAC&amp;dq=transmodernism&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions] Psychology Press, 2008, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophies==
Transmodernism's philosophical views contain elements of both modernism and postmodernism; it has been heralded as "new modernism" and admires [[avant-garde art|avant-garde styles]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Words and Music: Camus, Beckett, Cage, Gould|author=Weagel, D.F.|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433108365|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FcguzJ0VxC8C|page=9|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It bases much of its core beliefs on the [[Integral Theory]], those of creating a synthesis of "pre-modern", "modern" and "postmodern" realities.

In transmodernism, there is a place for both tradition and modernity, and it seeks as a movement to re-vitalise and modernise tradition rather than destroy or replace it. The honouring and reverence of antiquity and traditional lifestyles is very important in transmodernism, unlike modernism or postmodernism. Transmodernism criticises [[pessimism]], [[nihilism]], [[relativism]] and the [[counter-Enlightenment]], yet embracing, all to a limited extent, [[optimism]], [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]], [[foundationalism]] and [[universalism]]. It has an [[analogy|analogical]] way of thinking,&lt;ref name="Cole, Mike 2008, p. 69"/&gt; viewing things from the outside rather than the inside. 

==Movement==
As a movement, transmodernism puts a strong emphasis on [[spirituality]], alternative religions and [[transpersonal psychology]]. Unlike its postmodern counterpart, it disagrees with the secularisation of society, putting an emphasis on religion, and it criticises the rejection of worldviews as false or of no importance. Transmodernism places a strong emphasis on [[xenophily]] and [[globalism]], promoting the importance of different cultures and cultural appreciation. It seeks for a worldview on cultural affairs, and is anti-[[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] and anti-[[imperialism|imperialist]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;  

[[Environmentalism]], [[sustainability]] and ecology are important aspects of the transmodern theory; not only does transmodernism embrace environmental protection, yet it also stresses the importance of neighbourhood life, building communities as well as order and cleanliness. It accepts [[technological change]], yet only when its aim is that of improving life or human conditions.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Research in the Social Scientific Study of Religion.v.10|author1=Greer, J.M.|author2=Moberg, D.O.|date=2001|publisher=JAI Press|isbn=9780762304837|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QOa_6HNsp_EC|page=68|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent aspects of transmodernism are those of democracy and listening to the [[poverty|poor]] and [[suffering]]. 

Transmodernism in addition takes strong stances on [[feminism]], health care, family [[life]] and [[Intimate relationship|relationship]]s, promoting the emancipation of women and [[women's rights|female rights]], yet also promoting several traditional moral and ethical family values; the importance of the family is particularly stressed.

==Leading figures==
Today, whilst transmodernism still remains a minor philosophical movement in comparison to postmodernism, and is relatively new to the Northern Hemisphere, it has a large set of leading figures and philosophers. Enrique Dussel, its founder, is indeed an important philosophical figure. [[Ken Wilber]], the inventor of Integral Theory, argues from a [[transpersonal]] point of view, [[Paul Gilroy]], a cultural theorist, has also "enthusiastically endorsed" transmodern thinking,&lt;ref name="Cole, Mike 2008, p. 69"/&gt; and [[Ziauddin Sardar]], an [[Islam]]ic scholar, is a critic of postmodernism and in many cases adopts a transmodernist way of thinking. 

Several essays and works arguing from a transmodernist point of view have been published throughout the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrea|last=Mura|title=The Symbolic Scenarios of Islamism: A Study in Islamic Political Thought|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JXu1CwAAQBAJ|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Man wearing trenchcoat.jpg|right|thumb|Man wearing a trenchcoat.]]
A '''trench coat''' or '''trenchcoat''' is a [[raincoat]] made of [[waterproof]] heavy-duty [[cotton]] [[gabardine]] [[drill (fabric)|drill]], [[leather]], or [[poplin]].&lt;ref name="Foulkes 2007"&gt;{{cite book | last = Foulkes| first = Nick| title= The Trench Book | year=2007 | publisher= Assouline | isbn = 2759401634}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally has a removable [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] [[lining (sewing)|lining]], [[raglan sleeves]], and the classic versions come in various lengths ranging from just above the ankles (the longest) to above the knee (the shortest).&lt;ref name="Foulkes 2007"/&gt; It was originally an item of clothing for Army officers (developed before the war but adapted for use in the [[Trench#Military_engineering|trenches]] of the [[First World War]], hence its name) and shows this influence in its styling.

Traditionally this garment is [[double-breasted]] with 10 front buttons, has wide lapels, a storm flap and pockets that button-close.&lt;ref name="Foulkes 2007"/&gt; The coat is belted at the waist with a self-belt, as well as having straps around the wrists that also buckle (to keep water from running down the forearm when using binoculars in the rain). The coat often has shoulder straps that button-close; those were a functional feature in a military context. The traditional color of a trench coat was [[khaki]], although newer versions come in many colors.

==History==

[[Image:WWITrenchcoat.jpeg|left|thumb|[[British Army]] officer in the First World War.]]

The trench coat was developed as an alternative to the heavy [[serge (fabric)|serge]] [[greatcoat]]s worn by [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] soldiers in the [[First World War]]. Invention of the trench coat is claimed by two British luxury clothing manufacturers, [[Burberry]] and [[Aquascutum]], with Aquascutum's claim dating back to the 1850s. [[Thomas Burberry]] invented [[gabardine]] fabric in 1879 and submitted a design for an Army officer's raincoat to the [[United Kingdom]] [[War Office]] in 1901.&lt;ref name=burberry&gt;{{Cite news

The trench coat became an optional item of dress in the British Army, and was obtained by private purchase by officers and Warrant Officers Class I who were under no obligation to own them.&lt;ref name=officers&gt;{{Cite news

During the First World War, the design of the trench coat was modified to include [[shoulder strap]]s and [[D-ring]]s. The shoulder straps were for the attachment of epaulettes or other rank insignia; There is a popular myth that the D-ring was for the attachment of hand grenades.  The ring was originally for attaching map cases and swords or other equipment to the belt. This latter pattern was dubbed ''"trench coat"'' by the soldiers in the front line. Many trench coats had large pockets for maps and cleverly placed flaps and vents to deal with the odour associated with earlier rubber coats. A range of waterproof coats were designed and sold during wartime that incorporated War Office requirements with traditional aspects of leisurewear. What became known as the ‘trench coat’ combined the features of a military waterproof cape and the regulation greatcoat designed for British officers.&lt;ref name=Designhistory&gt;{{Cite news

During the [[Second World War]], officers of the [[United Kingdom]] continued to use the trench coat on the battlefield in inclement weather. Other nations also developed trench coat style jackets, notably the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and other armies of continental Europe such as [[Belgium]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (and are often seen in war zone photographs in the 1939-40 era, even worn by troops on the attack), although as the war progressed, in the field shorter "field jackets" became more popular, including garments such as the [[Denison smock]] used by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[commando]]s, [[paratrooper]]s, and [[sniper]]s and the [[M-1941 Field Jacket|M1941]]/[[U.S. Army M-1943 Uniform|M1943]] field jackets used by the [[United States Army|US Army]]. These garments were shorter and more practical than the trench coat, and as such they allowed the wearer to be more mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hilton | first = Frank | title= The Paras | year=1983 | publisher= British Broadcasting Corporation | isbn = 0-563-20099-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical trench coat is a ten-buttoned, double-breasted long coat made with tan, black, khaki, or beige fabric. Trench coats often have cuff straps, [[raglan sleeve]]s, [[shoulder strap]]s and a belt. The trench coat was typically worn as a [[windbreaker]] or as a rain jacket, and not for protection from the cold in winter or snowy conditions (although many come with removable wool liners for additional warmth, they are usually not as warm as an overcoat).  Period advertisements from World War I reveal that the trench coat was sized to wear over the British Warm, to offer water protection when the temperature was cold enough to require the heavier coat, which explains the traditionally generous sizing of trench coats; however, makers in recent years have resized trench coats downwards to conform more closely to overcoat sizing, as the two coats, trench and overcoat, would rarely if at all be worn together today. &lt;ref name=sizing&gt;{{Cite news

Trench coats have remained fashionable in the decades following [[World War II]]. Their original role as part of an army officer's uniform lent the trench coat a businesslike respectability, although many prefer to tie the belt in front (rather than use the buckle) to project a more casual look than strict military dress. [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s [[Rick Blaine]] from ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoldenera.net/hat_Bogart_Casablanca.html|title= Bogart-Casablanca|publisher=The Golden Era|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Sellers]]' [[Inspector Clouseau]] wore the trench coat in the public eye. Often, a [[fedora]] or an [[ushanka]] (during colder weather) was also worn. In the 1960s, radical intellectuals wore trench coats over black [[turtleneck sweater]]s, while some [[Mod (subculture)|Mods]] wore trench coats as fashionable overcoats, as an alternative to the [[fishtail parka]] or [[crombie (clothing)|crombie]].{{citation needed|reason=Could not quickly find corroboration on these details|date=February 2015}} [[streaking|Streaker]]s and [[Exhibitionism|flashers]] often prefer trench coats since they conceal the wearer's lack of undergarments and can be opened quickly when the exhibitionist is ready to expose him or herself.

While similar, the [[Heavy metal fashion|heavy metal]] and [[Goth fashion]] trend of black oilcloth [[Duster (clothing)|dusters]] are usually (incorrectly) referred to as trench coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metaleater.com/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=3232|title=Heavy Metal Fashion Returns|publisher=METALEATER|date=2006-03-24|accessdate=2008-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017042542/http://www.metaleater.com/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=3232|archive-date=2006-10-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early media reports of the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]] initially associated the perpetrators ([[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]]) with members of the "[[Trenchcoat Mafia]]", a group of outcasts who allegedly wore conspicuous black Australian oilcloth dusters. In the copycat [[W. R. Myers High School shooting]] days later, it was rumored the shooter had worn a trench coat. In the wake of these incidents, many public schools in the US forbade students from wearing trench coats, both because of their cultural associations and on the grounds that they could be used to conceal weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0423cc.htm|title=The Denver Post Online - Columbine - Tragedy and Recovery|website=extras.denverpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/04/20/columbine.irpt/index.html?_s=PM:US|title=Nothing the same after Columbine, say students, teachers - CNN.com|first=By  Rachel Rodriguez and Christina Zdanowicz|last=CNN|website=edition.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 557''', adopted unanimously on 28 November 1984, considered a report by the [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] regarding the [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force]]. The Council noted its efforts to establish a durable and just peace in the Middle East but also expressed its concern over the prevailing state of tension in the area.

The resolution decided to call upon the parties concerned to immediately implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|Resolution 338]] (1973), it renewed the mandate of the Observer Force for another six months until 31 May 1985 and requested that the Secretary-General submit a report on the situation at the end of that period.

Voigts, B. Schaff &amp;M. Pietrzak-Franger (Eds.). Reflecting on Darwin. Farnham, London: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a variety of approaches that extend the theory of [[Darwinism]] beyond its original domain of [[biological evolution]] on Earth. Universal Darwinism aims to formulate a generalized version of the mechanisms of [[Genetic diversity|variation]], [[natural selection|selection]] and [[heredity]] proposed by [[Charles Darwin]], so that they can apply to explain [[Evolution (disambiguation)|evolution]] in a wide variety of other domains, including [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[culture]], [[medicine]], [[computer science]] and [[physics]].

==Basic mechanisms==
At the most fundamental level, [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] states that organisms evolve and [[Adaptation|adapt]] to their environment by an iterative process.  This process can be conceived as an [[evolutionary algorithm]] that searches the space of possible forms (the [[fitness landscape]]) for the ones that are best adapted. The process has three components:

* [[Genetic diversity|variation]] of a given form or template. This is usually (but not necessarily) considered to be blind or random, and happens typically by [[mutation]] or [[genetic recombination|recombination]].
* [[Selection (biology)|selection]] of the [[fitness (biology)|fittest]] variants, i.e. those that are best suited to survive and reproduce in their given environment. The unfit variants are eliminated.
* [[heredity]] or retention, meaning that the features of the fit variants are retained and passed on, e.g. in offspring.

After those fit variants are retained, they can again undergo variation, either directly or in their offspring, starting a new round of the [[iteration]]. The overall mechanism is similar to the problem-solving procedures of [[trial-and-error]] or generate-and-test: evolution can be seen as searching for the best solution for the problem  of how to survive and reproduce by generating new trials, testing how well they perform, eliminating the failures, and retaining the successes.

The generalization made in "universal" Darwinism is to replace "organism" by any recognizable pattern, phenomenon, or system. The first requirement is that the pattern can "survive" (maintain, be retained) long enough or "reproduce" (replicate, be copied) sufficiently frequently so as not to disappear immediately. This is the heredity component: the information in the pattern must be retained or passed on. The second requirement is that during survival and reproduction variation (small changes in the pattern) can occur. The final requirement is that there  is a selective "preference" so that certain variants tend to survive or reproduce "better" than others. If these conditions are met, then, by the logic of natural selection, the pattern will evolve towards more adapted forms.

Examples of patterns that have been postulated to undergo variation and selection, and thus adaptation, are [[genes]], ideas ([[memes]]), theories, technologies, [[neurons]] and their connections, words, computer programs, firms, [[antibodies]], institutions, law and judicial systems, quantum states and even whole universes.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John (2009).

&lt;/ref&gt; but was still lacking the concept of natural selection. Darwin himself, together with subsequent 19th century thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[James Mark Baldwin]] and [[William James]], was quick to apply the idea of selection to other domains, such as language, psychology, society, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, G. M. (2005). Generalizing Darwinism to social evolution: Some early attempts. Journal of economic issues, 899–914&lt;/ref&gt; However, this evolutionary tradition was largely banned from the social sciences in the beginning of the 20th century, in part because of the bad reputation of [[social Darwinism]], an attempt to use Darwinism to justify social inequality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Starting in the 1950s, [[Donald T. Campbell]] was one of  the first and most influential authors to revive the tradition, and to formulate a generalized Darwinian [[algorithm]] directly applicable to phenomena outside of biology.&lt;ref&gt;Gontier, N. (2006). Evolutionary Epistemology. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. http://www.iep.utm.edu/evo-epis/&lt;/ref&gt; In this, he was inspired by [[William Ross Ashby]]'s view of [[self-organization]] and intelligence as fundamental processes of selection.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. T. (1960). Blind variation and selective retention in creative thought as in other knowledge processes. Psychological Review, 67(6), 380–400.&lt;/ref&gt; His aim was to explain the development of [[science]] and other forms of [[knowledge]] by focusing on the variation and selection of ideas and theories, thus laying the basis for the domain of [[evolutionary epistemology]]. In the 1990s, Campbell's formulation of the mechanism of "blind-variation-and-selective-retention" (BVSR) was further developed and extended to other domains under the labels of "universal selection theory"&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. T. (1990). Epistemological roles for selection theory. Evolution, cognition, and realism: Studies in evolutionary epistemology, 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; or "universal selectionism"&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, G. M.

[[Richard Dawkins]] may have first coined the term "universal Darwinism" in 1983 to describe his conjecture that any possible life forms existing outside the solar system would evolve by natural selection just as they do on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, R. (1983) Universal Darwinism. In: Evolution from molecules to man, ed. D.&amp;nbsp;S. Bendall. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This conjecture was also presented in 1983 in a paper entitled “The Darwinian Dynamic” that dealt with the evolution of order in living systems and certain nonliving physical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RA, Vemulapalli GK. (1983) The Darwinian Dynamic. Quarterly Review of Biology 58, 185-207.  {{jstor|2828805}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was suggested “that ‘life’, wherever it might exist in the universe, evolves according to the same dynamical law” termed the Darwinian dynamic.  [[Henry Plotkin]] in his 1997 book&lt;ref&gt;Plotkin, H. C. (1997). Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Darwin machines]] makes the link between universal Darwinism and Campbell's evolutionary epistemology. [[Susan Blackmore]], in her 1999 book ''[[The Meme Machine]]'', devotes a chapter titled 'Universal Darwinism' to a discussion of the applicability of the Darwinian process to a wide range of scientific subject matters.

The philosopher of mind [[Daniel Dennett]], in his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', developed the idea of a Darwinian process, involving variation, selection and retention, as a generic algorithm that is substrate-neutral and could be applied to many fields of knowledge outside of biology. He described the idea of natural selection as a "universal acid" that cannot be contained in any vessel, as it seeps through the walls and spreads ever further, touching and transforming ever more domains. He notes in particular the field of [[memetics]] in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C. (2005), Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Touchstone Press, New York. pp. 352&amp;ndash;360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In agreement with Dennett's prediction, over the past decades the Darwinian perspective has spread ever more widely, in particular across the [[social sciences]] as the foundation for numerous schools of study including [[memetics]], [[evolutionary economics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[evolutionary anthropology]], [[neural Darwinism]], and [[evolutionary linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Oudeyer, P.-Y. and Kaplan, F. (2007) [http://www.pyoudeyer.com/oudeyer-kaplan-cp07.pdf Language Evolution as a Darwinian Process: Computational Studies]. Cognitive Processing, 8(1):21&amp;ndash;35&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have postulated Darwinian processes as operating at the foundations of physics, cosmology and chemistry via the theories of [[quantum Darwinism]],&lt;ref&gt;

Author D. B. Kelley has formulated one of the most all-encompassing approaches to Universal Darwinism. In his 2013 book ''The Origin of Everything'', he holds that [[natural selection]] involves not the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life, as shown by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], but the preservation of favored systems in contention for existence. The fundamental mechanism behind all such stability and evolution is therefore what Kelley calls "[[survival of the fittest]] systems."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origin of Everything via Universal Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Systems in Contention for Existence|last=Kelley|first=D. B.|publisher=Woodhollow Press|year=2013|isbn=0985462507|location=Newbury, Ohio|pages=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because all systems are cyclical, the Darwinian processes of [[iteration]], variation and [[Natural selection|selection]] are operative not only among species but among all natural phenomena both large-scale and small. Kelley thus maintains that, since the [[Big Bang]] especially, the [[universe]] has evolved from a highly chaotic state to one that is now highly ordered with many stable phenomena, naturally selected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==Examples of universal Darwinist theories==
The following approaches can all be seen as exemplifying a generalization of Darwinian ideas outside of their original domain of biology. These "Darwinian extensions" can be grouped in two categories, depending on whether they discuss implications of biological (genetic) evolution in other disciplines (e.g. medicine or psychology), or discuss processes of variation and selection of entities other than genes (e.g. computer programs, firms or ideas). However, there is no strict separation possible, since most of these approaches (e.g. in sociology, psychology and linguistics) consider both genetic and non-genetic (e.g. cultural) aspects of evolution, as well as the interactions between them (see e.g. [[gene-culture coevolution]]).

The British statesman [[Winston Churchill]] was a [[Winston Churchill as writer|prolific writer throughout his life]], and many of his works were historical. His better-known historical works include: ''[[Marlborough: His Life and Times]]'', ''[[The World Crisis]]'' (a history of [[World War I]]), ''[[The Second World War (Churchill)|The Second World War]]'', and ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]''. Churchill was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1953 for "his mastery of historical and biographical description".

==Churchill's view of history==
Churchill was an exponent of the view that the British and American people had a unique greatness and destiny and that [[Whig_history|all British history should be seen as progress towards fulfilling that destiny]]. This belief inspired his political career as well as his historical writing. 

Although Churchill was not a trained historian, the influences on his historical thought and prose style, were likely [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]]'s history of the [[English Civil War]], [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall]]'' and [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s ''History of England''.

Churchill's historical works fall into three categories: family history, autobiography and narrative history.

===Family history===
The first category comprises his works of family history: the biography of his father, ''[[Lord Randolph Churchill]]'' in two volumes (1906), and of that of his great ancestor, ''[[Marlborough: His Life and Times]]'' in four volumes (1933–38).

===Autobiography===
The second category is Churchill's autobiographical works, including his early journalistic compilations ''The Story of the Malakand Field Force'' (1898), ''The River War'' (1899), ''London to Ladysmith via Pretoria'' (1900) and ''Ian Hamilton's March'' (1900). These latter two were issued in a re-edited form as ''My Early Life'' (1930). All of these books contain  information about Britain's imperial wars in India, Sudan and South Africa. The works on South Africa contain elements of self-promotion, since Churchill was a candidate for Parliament in 1900.

These four books were republished as ''Frontiers and Wars: His Four Early Books Covering His Life As Soldier and War Correspondent'', New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc., 1962.

===Narrative history===
Churchill's reputation as a writer, however, rests on his multi-volume works of narrative history: ''[[The World Crisis]]'' (six volumes, 1923–31), and of ''[[The Second World War (Churchill)|The Second World War]]'' (six volumes, 1948–53), and his ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'' (four volumes, 1956–58, much of which had been written as journalism in the 1930s). These are among the longest works of history ever published: ''The Second World War'' runs to more than two million words.

Churchill's histories of the two world wars were based on the author's status as a central participant in both stories. Although both are memoirs as well as histories, Churchill was careful to broaden their scope to include events in which he played no part—the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, for example. Inevitably, however, Churchill placed Britain, and therefore himself, at the centre of his narrative. [[Arthur Balfour]] described ''The World Crisis'' as "Winston's brilliant autobiography, disguised as a history of the universe." In any case he had far fewer documentary sources for matters not involving Britain.

==Access to documents==
As a Cabinet minister for part of the First World War and as Prime Minister for nearly all of the Second, Churchill had unique access to official documents, military plans, official secrets and correspondence between world leaders. After the First War, when there were few rules governing these documents, Churchill simply took many of them with him when he left office, and used them freely in his books, particularly for'' [[The World Crisis]]''. This was done by other wartime ministers such as [[David Lloyd George]], but, following the First World War, stricter rules were put in place regarding Cabinet documents. 

''[[The World Crisis]]'' began as a response to [[Reginald Baliol Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]]'s attack on his reputation in his memoirs, but it soon broadened out into a general multi-volume history. The volumes are a mix of military history, written with Churchill's usual narrative flair, diplomatic and political history, portraits of other political and military figures, and personal memoir, written in a colourful manner. 

When he resumed office in 1939, Churchill fully intended to write a history of the war then beginning. He said several times: "I will leave judgements on this matter to history—but I will be one of the historians." To circumvent the rules against the use of official documents, he took the precaution throughout the war of having a weekly summary of correspondence, minutes, memoranda and other documents printed in galleys and headed "Prime Minister's personal minutes". As well, Churchill actually wrote or dictated a number of letters and memoranda with the specific intention of placing his views on the record for later use as a historian.

==Controversy==
This all became a source of great controversy when ''The Second World War'' began appearing in 1948. Churchill was not an academic historian, he was a politician, and was in fact Leader of the Opposition, still intending to return to office. By what right, it was asked, did he have access to Cabinet, military and diplomatic records which were denied to other historians? 

What was unknown at the time was that Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] agreed to allow him (or rather his research assistants) free access to all documents, provided that (a) no official secrets were revealed (b) the documents were not used for party political purposes and (c) the typescript was vetted by the Cabinet Secretary, [[Norman Brook|Sir Norman Brook]]. Brook took a close interest in the books and rewrote some sections himself to ensure that nothing was said which might harm British interests or embarrass the government. Churchill's history thus became a semi-official one.

'''Yevdokiya Nagrodskaya''' ({{lang-rus|Евдокия Нагродская}}; 1866–1930), was a Russian novelist in [[fin-de-siècle]] [[Russia]] whose first novel was titled ''[[The Wrath of Dionysus]]''. Her [[debut novel]] was published in 1910 and explored the theme of her perception of "sexual identity and gender roles" of men and women in Russia. It was very popular in pre-revolutionary Russia among the middle-class people and was controversial.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=21056|title=The Wrath of Dionysus|website=Indiana University Press|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was so popular that it was reprinted 10 times and translated into [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]]. It was also made into a silent movie with erotic content.&lt;ref name=New&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/19970811/24140-a-new-view-of-russia.html|title=A New View of Russia|accessdate=22 April 2016|publisher= Publishersweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Nagrodskai︠a︡|McReynolds|1997|p=review}}

''The Wrath of Dionysus'' was translated into English only in 1997 at the initiative of [[Louise McReynolds]], a professor of history, in particular of Russian culture, at the [[University of Hawaii]]. It was published by the Indiana University Press&lt;ref name=New/&gt; and co-won the [[Heldt Prize]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
==Life==
Yevdokiya Nagrodskaya was born as Evdokiia Apollonovna Golovacheva in Russia in 1866. Her mother was [[Avdotya Panaeva]], a writer of fiction and memoirs who co-edited the journal ''[[Sovremennik]]'' (1848–63), and her father was [[Apollon Golovachev]], a journalist. 

She was later married and migrated to France after the publication of her novels. Later her novels were not popular in Russia.&lt;ref name="High"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591306914.html|title=Nagródskaia, Evdokiia (1866–1930)|publisher=Highbeam.com|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nagrodskaya died in 1930.&lt;ref name="High" /&gt;

== ''The Wrath of Dionysus'' ==
In 1910, Nagrodskaya published her first novel, ''The Wrath of Dionysus.'' The book was described by Russia scholar [[Laura Engelstein]] as "boulevard fiction" in ''The Keys to Happiness: Sex and the Search for Modernity in Fin-de-Siècle Russia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Keys to Happiness: Sex and the Search for Modernity in Fin-de-siècle Russia|last=Engelstein|first=Laura|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Libertinage in Russian Culture and Literature,'' Alexei Lalo stated that "[Nagródskaia] may have felt the need to represent the continuum of heterosexual and homosexual love and shifting gender identity more completely and insightfully than her contemporaries Zinovieva-Annibal or Verbitskaya did" and described the novel as "a more modern—and modernizing—literary phenomenon that many diverse researchers ... have taken it to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Libertinage in Russian Culture and Literature|last=Lalo|first=Alexei|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wrath of Dionysus'' was highly popular and became a bestseller. After its success, she published more novels such as ''The Bronze Door'', ''The River of Times'', and ''The White Colonnade''.&lt;ref name="New" /&gt;{{Sfn|Nagrodskai︠a︡|McReynolds|1997|p=review}} 

''The Wrath of Dionysus'' was published in English in 1997 and was translated by Louise McReynolds, who said, "The Wrath of Dionysus is a rich blend of early cultural politics and explorations of sexual identity." She presents in this novel, set in [[Caucasus]], in the 20th-century middle-class Russia riddled with muddled conceptions about sex, her perception of gender difference by stating that [[effeminate]] men who show deep affection to their children are [[homosexual]], and women who are masculine in nature with independent thinking are [[lesbian]]; but both derive sexual pleasure from each other.&lt;ref name="Kalfus"&gt;{{Cite web|last= Kalfus|first= Ken|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/12/14/bib/971214.rv115927.html|title= The Wrath Of Dionysus|date= 14 December 1997|accessdate=22 April 2016|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English edition of the novel was reviewed by the ''[[Midwest Book Review]]'', who described it as an "outstanding edition," and by the ''[[Library Journal]]'', who said that it was "highly recommended for collections of Slavic literature as well as popular fiction."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote, "The themes of The Wrath of Dionysus sound so contemporary that it may surprise readers to find them in a Russian novel published more than 80 years ago."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ''[[Kirkus Reviews|Kirkus Review]]'' described the book as "well-known throughout Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/evdokia-nagrodskaia/the-wrath-of-dionysus/|title=THE WRATH OF DIONYSUS by Evdokia Nagrodskaia {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|website=Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
