      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4365">In [[geometry]], an '''affine plane''' is a two-dimensional [[affine space]]. Typical examples of affine planes are
*[[Euclidean plane]]s, which are affine planes over the [[real number|reals]], equipped with a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], the [[Euclidean distance]]. In other words, an affine plane over the reals is a Euclidean plane in which one has "forgotten" the metric (that is, one does not talk of lengths nor of angle measures). 
* [[Vector space]]s of dimension two, in which the [[zero vector]] is not considered as different from the other elements
* For every [[field (mathematics)|field]] or [[division ring]] ''F'', the set ''F''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the pairs of elements of ''F''
* The result of removing any single line (and all the points on this line) from any [[projective plane#Affine planes|projective plane]]
All the affine planes defined over a field are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. More precisely, the choice of an [[affine coordinate system]] (or, in the real case, a [[Cartesian coordinate system]]) for an affine plane ''P'' over a field ''F'' induces an isomorphism of affine planes between ''P'' and ''F''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

In the more general situation, where the affine planes are not defined over a field, they will in general not be isomorphic. Two affine planes arising from the same [[Non-Desarguesian plane|non-Desarguesian projective plane]] by the removal of different lines may not be isomorphic.

There are two ways to formally define affine planes, which are equivalent for affine planes over a field. The first one consists in defining an affine plane as a set on which a vector space of dimension two [[group action|acts simply transitively]]. Intuitively, this means that an affine plane is a vector space of dimension two in which one has "forgotten" where the origin is. In [[incidence geometry]], an [[affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine plane]] is defined as an abstract system of points and lines satisfying a system of axioms.

In the applications of mathematics, there are often situations where an affine plane without the Euclidean metric is used instead of the Euclidean plane. For example, in a [[Graph of a function|graph]], which can be drawn on paper, and in which the position of a particle is plotted against time, the Euclidean metric is not adequate for its interpretation, since the distances between its points or the measures of the angles between its lines have, in general, no physical importance (in the affine plane the axes can use different units, which are not comparable, and the measures also vary with different units and scales&lt;ref&gt;See also the books of [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]], "Gaussian Self-Affinity and Fractals", of [[Howard Levi|Levi]], "Foundations of Geometry and Trigonometry", and of [[Isaak Yaglom|Yaglom]], "A Simple Non-Euclidean Geometry and its Physical Basis".&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Bamberg|author2=Shlomo Sternberg|author2-link=Shlomo Sternberg|title=A Course in Mathematics for Students of Physics|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WgZ3Ia0SPE8C&amp;pg=PA1|date=1991|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-40649-9|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Levi|author-link=Howard Levi|title=Topics in Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-NUAAAAYAAJ|date=1975|publisher=R.

'''''At the Abyss: An Insider's History of the Cold War''''' ({{ISBN|0-89141-821-0}}) is an autobiographical book about [[Thomas C. Reed]]'s experience at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] through his time as an advisor to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. It reveals new details about the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[Farewell Dossier]], and other facets of the [[Cold War]].

==Sabotage allegations==
In the book, Reed stated the United States added a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] to gas pipeline control software that the Soviet Union obtained from a company in Canada.&lt;ref name="The New York Times; October 26, 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/science/27trojan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=science&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Cyberwar: Old Trick Threatens the Newest Weapons|work=The New York Times|date=October 26, 2009|access-date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Reed, when the components were deployed on a [[Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhgorod pipeline|Trans-Siberian gas pipeline]], the Trojan horse led to a huge explosion.&lt;ref name="The New York Times; October 26, 2009"/&gt; He wrote: "The pipeline software that was to run the pumps, turbines and valves was programmed to go haywire, to reset pump speeds and valve settings to produce pressures far beyond those acceptable to the pipeline joints and welds. The result was the most monumental non-nuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space."&lt;ref name="The New York Times; October 26, 2009"/&gt;

A report in the ''[[Moscow Times]]'' quoted KGB veteran Vasily Pchelintsev as saying that there was a natural gas pipeline explosion in 1982, but it was near [[Tobolsk]] on a pipeline connecting the [[Urengoy gas field]] to the city of [[Chelyabinsk]], and it was caused by poor construction rather than sabotage; according to Pchelintsev's account, no one was killed in the explosion and the damage was repaired within one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anatoly |last=Medetsky |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/kgb-veteran-denies-cia-caused-82-blast/232261.html |title=KGB Veteran Denies CIA Caused '82 Blast|newspaper=Moscow Times |date=March 18, 2004 |access-date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed's account has also not been corroborated by intelligence agencies in the United States.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Business; October 10, 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hesseldahl  |first1=Arik |last2=Kharif  |first2=Olga |date=October 10, 2014 |title=Cyber Crime and Information Warfare: A 30-Year History |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/ss/10/10/1014_cyber_attacks/1.htm |newspaper=Bloomberg Business |page=2 |access-date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point of criticism of the sabotage allegations is that, according to Prof. V.D. Zakhmatov, an explosion safety expert who has overseen the safety measures on many of the Soviet oil and gas pipelines built in the Eighties,&lt;ref name="Zakhmatov"&gt;{{cite web|title=An explosion, which… wasn't|url=http://ogas.kiev.ua/perspective/vzryv-kotorogo-ne-bylo-581|work=[[OGAS]] memorial site|accessdate=July 19, 2016|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the described timeframe Soviet Union simply didn't practice [[SCADA|digital control]] of its pipeline system. Most of the control was manual, and whatever [[automation]] was used utilized the [[Analog device|analog control system]]s, most of which worked through [[pneumatics]].&lt;ref name="Zakhmatov"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
According to a review in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'': "The writing is sometimes discursive if seldom dull, and some areas have already been adequately covered by others. But the book deserves quite high marks for how much it pulls together, as well as offering a viewpoint on the Cold War not nearly sufficiently well-represented in the public literature: that neither the U.S. nor Soviet sciences were dominated by stereotypical, bomb-happy maniacs."&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|title=At the Abyss: An Insider's History of the Cold War |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-89141-821-4|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=May 27, 2016|date=February 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biocomposite''' ({{em|bio}} from Greek ''''''alive'''''')  is a [[composite material]] formed by a [[Matrix (chemical analysis)|matrix]] ([[resin]]) and a reinforcement of [[natural fibers]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fazeli|first1=M.|last2=Florez|first2=J.|last3=Simão|first3=R.|title=Improvement in adhesion of cellulose fibers to the thermoplastic starch matrix by plasma treatment modification|journal=Composites Part B: Engineering|date=9 November 2018|volume=163|doi=10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.11.048|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359836818327793}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These kind of materials often mimic the structure of the living materials involved in the process keeping the strengthening properties of the matrix that was used, but always providing biocompatibility.
The matrix phase is formed by [[polymers]] derived from [[renewable]] and nonrenewable resources. The matrix is important to protect the fibers from [[environmental degradation]] and mechanical damage, to hold the fibers together and to transfer the loads on it. In addition, biofibers are the principal components of biocomposites, which are derived from biological origins, for example fibers from [[crops]] ([[cotton]], [[flax]] or [[hemp]]), recycled [[wood]], waste [[paper]], crop processing byproducts or regenerated [[cellulose fiber]] (viscose/rayon). 
The interest in biocomposites is rapidly growing in terms of industrial applications ([[automobiles]], [[railway coach]], [[aerospace]], [[military]] applications, [[construction]], and [[packaging]]) and fundamental research, due to its great benefits (renewable, cheap, [[recyclable]], and [[biodegradable]]). Biocomposites can be used alone, or as a complement to standard materials, such as carbon fiber. Advocates of biocomposites state that use of these materials improve health and safety in their production, are lighter in weight, have a visual appeal similar to that of wood, and are environmentally superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are natural fiber composites environmentally superior to glass fiber reinforced composites?|url=https://www.msu.edu/user/satish/CompositsesA-final%20published.pdf|website=Michigan State University|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=They may be sustainable, but how good are flax and jute for the engineer?|url=http://www.materialsforengineering.co.uk/engineering-materials-features/they-may-be-sustainable-but-how-good-are-flax-and-jute-for-the-engineer/52093/|website=Engineering Materials|publisher=Findlay Media|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bio-composites update: Beyond eco-branding|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/biocomposites-update-beyond-eco-branding|website=Composites World|publisher=Gardner Business Media, Inc.|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biocomposites Guide|url=https://netcomposites.com/guide-tools/tools/biocomposites-guide/|website=NetComposites|publisher=NetComposites Ltd|accessdate=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fazeli|first1=M.|last2=Keley|first2=M.|last3=Biazar|first3=E.|title=Preparation and characterization of starch-based composite films reinforced by cellulose nanofibers|journal=international Journal of Biological Macromolecules|date=2 May 2018|volume=116|doi=10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.04.186|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813018308754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[Image:VeluweTreeTrunk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Wood fibers are used to produce bicomposites]]

The differential for this class of composites is that they are biodegradable and pollute the environment less which is a concern for many scientists and engineers to minimize the environmental impact of the production of a composite. They are a renewable source, cheap, and in certain cases completely recyclable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are natural fiber composites environmentally superior to glass fiber reinforced composites?|url=https://www.msu.edu/user/satish/CompositsesA-final%20published.pdf|website=Michigan State University|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One advantage of natural fibers is their low density, which results in a higher tensile strength and stiffness than glass fibers, besides of its lower manufacturing costs. As such, biocomposites could be a viable ecological alternative to carbon, glass, and man-made fiber composites. Natural fibers have a hollow structure, which gives insulation against noise and heat. It is a class of materials that can be easily processed, and thus, they are suited to a wide range of applications, such as packaging, building (roof structure, bridge, window, door, green kitchen), automobiles, aerospace, military applications, electronics, consumer products and medical industry (prosthetic, bone plate, orthodontic archwire, total hip replacement, and composite screws and pins).

==Classification==

Biocomposites are divided into non-wood fibers and [[wood]] fibers, all of which present [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]]. The non-wood fibers (natural fibers) are more attractive for the industry due to the physical and mechanical properties which they present. Also, these fibers are relatively long fibers, and present high cellulose content, which delivers a high tensile strength, and degree of cellulose crystallinity, whereas natural fibers have some disadvantages because they have [[hydroxyl]] groups (OH) in the fiber that can attract water molecules, and thus, the fiber might swell. This results in voids at the interface of the composite, which will affect the mechanical properties and loss in dimensional stability. The wood fibers have this name because almost than 60% of its mass is wood elements. It presents softwood fibers (long and flexible) and hardwood fibers (shorter and stiffer), and has low degree of cellulose crystallinity.

The natural fibers are divided into straw [[fibers]], [[bast fibre|bast]], [[leaf]], [[seed]] or [[fruit]], and [[grass]] fibers. The fibers most widely used in the industry are [[flax]], [[jute]], [[hemp]], [[kenaf]], [[sisal]] and [[coir]]. The straw fibers could be found in many parts of the world, and it is an example of a low-cost reinforcement for biocomposites. The wood fibers could be recycled or non-recycled. Thus, many polymers as [[polyethylene]] (PE), [[polypropylene]] (PP), and [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) are being used in wood composites industries.

==Flax applications==

Flax linen composites work well for applications seeking a lighter weight alternative to other materials, most notably, applications in automotive interior components and sports equipment. For automotive interiors, Composites Evolution has performed prototype testing for the Land Rover Defender and the Jaguar XF, with the Defender's flax composite 60% lighter than the production counterpart at the same stiffness, and the XF's flax composite part 35% lighter than the production component at the same stiffness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lightweight Stiff Door Module|url=http://www.compositesevolution.com/case-studies/lightweight-stiff-door-module/|website=Composites Evolution|publisher=Composites Evolution|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sports equipment, Ergon Bikes produced a concept saddle that won first place among 439 entries in the Accessories category at the Eurobike 2012, a major bicycling industry trade show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ergon Bike Ergonomics flax saddle is acclaimed by the whole bike industry|url=http://www.playnaturallysmart.org/2012/08/30/ergon-bike-ergonomics-flax-saddle-is-acclaimed-by-the-whole-bike-industry/|website=Play Naturally Smart|publisher=Bcomp|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; VE Paddles has produce a boat paddle blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flax composite paddle by VE Paddles using Bcomp's flax composite|url=http://www.jeccomposites.com/news/composites-news/flax-composite-paddle-ve-paddles-using-bcomps-flax-composite|website=JEC Composites|publisher=The Center for Promotion of Composites|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flaxland Canoes has developed a canoe that has a covering of flax linen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Composites Evolution Showcase Biotex Flax Canoe|url=https://netcomposites.com/news/2011/september/20/composites-evolution-showcase-biotex-flax-canoe/|website=NetComposites|publisher=NetComposites|accessdate=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magine Snowboards has developed a snowboard that incorporates flax linen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biocomposite snowboard using Biotex flax fabric|url=http://www.jeccomposites.com/news/composites-news/biocomposite-snowboard-using-biotex-flax-fabric|website=JEC Composites|publisher=The Center for Promotion of Composite|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samsara Surfboards has produced a flax linen surfboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsara 'eco surfboard' features Biotex flax fibre|url=http://www.materialstoday.com/carbon-fiber/news/samsara-eco-surfboard-features-biotex-flax-fibre/|website=Materials Today|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idris Ski's Lynx won an ISPO Award in 2013 for the Lynx ski&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Idris Skis - Lynx - ISPO Award Winner 2013|url=http://award.ispo.com/en/Winner-2013/Products/Ski/Ski-off-Piste/Idris-Skis/|website=ISPO|publisher=ISPO|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flax linen composites also work for applications for which the look, feel, or sound of wood is desired, but without susceptibility to warping. Applications include furniture and musical instruments. In furniture, a team at Sheffield Hallam University designed a cabinet with entirely sustainable materials, including flax linen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lightweight Stiff Door Module|url=http://www.shu.ac.uk/mediacentre/biodegradable-cabinet-new-approach-sustainability|website=Sheffield Hallam University|publisher=Sheffield Hallam University|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In musical instruments, [[Blackbird Guitars]] has produced a ukulele made with flax linen that has won a number of design awards in the composites industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackbird launches plant fiber-based composite musical instrument|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/news/blackbird-launches-plant-fiber-based-composite-musical-instrument|website=Composites World|publisher=Gardner Business Media|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check Out the Competition: Visit the Awards Pavilion at The Composites And Advanced Material Expo (CAMX)|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/ace-and-camx-awards-nominees-announced|website=Composites World|publisher=Gardner Business Media|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highlights from JEC Americas|url=http://www.compositesworld.com/blog/post/highlights-from-jec-americas|website=Composites World|publisher=Gardner Business Media|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 IDSA IDEA Award - Bronze - Entertainment - Blackbird Clara Ukulele|url=http://www.idsa.org/awards/idea/entertainment/blackbird-clara-ukulele|publisher=Industrial Designers Society of America|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a guitar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=And Now, the Linen Guitar|url=http://www.oaklandmagazine.com/And-Now-the-Linen-Guitar/|website=Oakland Magazine|publisher=Telegraph Media|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green composites ===

Green composites are classified as a biocomposite combined by natural fibers with [[biodegradable]] resins. They are called green composites mainly because of their degradable and sustainable properties, which can be easily disposed without harming the environment. Because of their durability, green composites are mainly used to increase the life cycle of products with short life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fazeli|first1=M.|last2=Florez|first2=J.|last3=Simão|first3=R.|title=Improvement in adhesion of cellulose fibers to the thermoplastic starch matrix by plasma treatment modification|journal=Composites Part B: Engineering|date=9 November 2018|volume=163|doi=10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.11.048|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359836818327793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrid composites ===

Another class of biocomposite is called 'hybrid biocomposite', which is based on different types of fibers into a single matrix. The fibers can be synthetic or natural, and can be randomly combined to generate the hybrid composites&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Its functionality depends directly on the balance between the good and bad properties of each individual material used. Besides, with the use of a composite that has two more types of fibers in the hybrid composite, one fiber can stand on the other one when it is blocked. 
The properties of this biocomposite depends directly on the fibers counting their content, length, arrangement, and also the bonding to the matrix. In particular, the strength of the hybrid composite depends on the failure strain of the individual fibers.

== Processing ==

[[Image:Compounding-en.png|thumb|upright=1.4| Compounding process, biocomposite materials based
on thermoplastic polymers such as polypropylene and polyethylene are processed by compounding and
extrusion.]]
The production of biocomposites uses techniques that are used to manufacture plastics or composites materials. These techniques include:

* [[Machine press]];
* [[Filament winding]];
* [[Pultrusion]];
* [[Extrusion]] (most widely used, principally for green biocomposite);
* [[Injection molding]];
* [[Compression molding]];
* [[Resin transfer molding]];
* [[Sheet moulding compound]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6701">A '''biogas upgrader''' is a facility that is used to concentrate the [[methane]] in [[biogas]] to [[natural gas]] standards. The system removes [[carbon dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulphide]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgc.se/dokument/Evaluation.pdf EVALUATION OF UPGRADING TECHNIQUES FOR BIOGAS, Margareta Persson, October 2003, School of Environmental Engineering, Lund University]&lt;/ref&gt; [[water]] and contaminants from the biogas. One technique for doing this uses [[amine gas treating]]. This purified biogas is also called [[biomethane]]. It can be used interchangeably with natural gas.

Raw biogas produced from digestion is roughly 60% methane and 29% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with trace elements of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S; it is not high quality enough to be used as fuel gas for machinery. The corrosive nature of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S alone is enough to destroy the internals of a plant.

The solution is the use of biogas upgrading or purification processes whereby contaminants in the raw biogas stream are absorbed or scrubbed, leaving more methane per unit volume of gas. There are four main methods of upgrading: water washing, [[pressure swing adsorption]], [[Selexol|selexol adsorbtion]], and [[amine gas treating]].

== Water washing ==

The most prevalent method is water washing whereby high pressure gas flows into a column in which the carbon dioxide and other trace elements are scrubbed by cascading water running counter-flow to the gas. This arrangement can deliver 98% methane with manufacturers guaranteeing maximum 2% methane loss in the system. It takes roughly between 3% and 6% of the total energy output in gas to run a biogas upgrading system

== Pressure Swing Adsorption ==

A typical PSA system for biogas will have four stages, one each for water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zafar|first=Salman|title=PSA System for Biogas Upgradation|url=http://www.bioenergyconsult.com/psa-system-for-biogas-upgradation/|publisher=Energy Consult|accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gas to be upgraded enters each vessel, is compressed to a high pressure whereby the gas to be removed is adsorbed on to the surface of the adsorbent, and is then decompressed allowing the methane to leave.  The adsorbent is then regenerated.  For oxygen, molecular sieve is used, for nitrogen a zeolite, for carbon dioxide and water a zeolite or activated carbon.

== Selexol ==

In the [[Selexol]] process (now licensed by UOP LLC), the Selexol solvent dissolves (absorbs) the acid gases from the feed gas at relatively high pressure, usually 300 to 2000 psia (2.07 to 13.8 MPa). The rich solvent containing the acid gases is then let down in pressure and/or steam stripped to release and recover the acid gases. The Selexol process can operate selectively to recover [[hydrogen sulfide]] and carbon dioxide as separate streams, so that the hydrogen sulfide can be sent to either a Claus unit for conversion to elemental sulfur or to a WSA Process unit for conversion to sulfuric acid while, at the same time, the carbon dioxide can be sequestered or used for enhanced oil recovery.

Selexol is a physical solvent, unlike amine based acid gas removal solvents that rely on a chemical reaction with the acid gases. Since no chemical reactions are involved, Selexol usually requires less energy than the amine based processes. However, at feed gas pressures below about 300 psia(2.07 MPa), the Selexol solvent capacity (in amount of acid gas absorbed per volume of solvent) is reduced and the amine based processes will usually be superior.

==Amine gas treater==

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S or both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be removed with this technology.

The chemistry involved in the amine treating of such gases varies somewhat with the particular amine being used. For one of the more common amines, monoethanolamine (MEA) denoted as '''''RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''''', the chemistry may be expressed as:

:RNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S &lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; RNH{{su|p=+|b=3}} + SH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

A typical amine gas treating process includes an '''absorber''' unit and a '''regenerator''' unit .  In the absorber, the downflowing amine solution absorbs H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the upflowing sour gas to produce a gas stream  free of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide as a product and an amine solution rich in the absorbed acid gases.  The resultant "rich" amine is then routed into the regenerator (a stripper with a [[reboiler]]) to produce regenerated or "lean" amine that is recycled for reuse in the absorber. The stripped overhead gas from the regenerator is concentrated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Objectives and variants ==
{{ Main article|biomethane }}
[[File:Biogas pipes.JPG|thumb|biogas and natural gas pipelines]]

A distinction can be drawn between the basic treatment of  raw biogas, which is necessary for example for use in a biogas [[Cogeneration|CHP]] plant, and the more elaborate treatment needed to obtain [[natural gas]] quality ([[biomethane]]).
The above table shows the composition of raw biogas after primary treatment and biomethane. The fractions of crude biogas can vary greatly, depending on substrate, plant design, and other factors. The nature of the biomethane is adapted to the corresponding qualities of natural gas.

Biogas is used mostly directly in a [[biogas plant|biogas]] [[cogeneration plant]]. This requires desulfurization and drying in order to avoid [[corrosion]] in the CHP. To be able to feed biogas into the [[natural gas network]] or for fuel use,  a more comprehensive treatment is necessary.  In addition to drying and desulfurization the [[carbon dioxide]] must be removed and chemical conditioning to obtain properties meeting the specifications for natural gas. This biomethane can be injected into the natural gas network and converted to electricity and heat through CHP at a place where the heat can be used, such as a  swimming pool, which has a year-round high heat demand.

Use of the natural gas 'grid' also permits retail customers to purchase a certain proportion of biomethane gas in their gas supply contracts

[[File:World ocean map.gif|right|thumb|240px|Maps exhibiting the world's oceanic waters. A continuous body of water encircling the [[Earth]], the [[World Ocean|world (global) ocean]] is divided into a number of principal areas. Five oceanic divisions are usually recognized: [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]], and [[Southern Ocean|Southern]]; the last two listed are sometimes consolidated into the first three.|alt=Rotating series of maps showing alternate divisions of the oceans]]

The '''borders of the oceans''' are the limits of the [[Earth]]'s [[ocean]]ic waters. The definition and number of oceans can vary depending on the adopted criteria.

==Overview==
Though generally described as several separate oceans, the world's oceanic waters constitute one global, interconnected body of salt water sometimes referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;" {{cite|date=2002|title=Ocean|work=The Columbia Encyclopedia|publisher=Columbia University Press|place=New York|url=http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126035624/http://www.answers.com/topic/ocean#Columbia_Encyclopedia_d|archivedate=26 January 2011|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;{{cite|title=Distribution of land and water on the planet|work=UN Atlas of the Oceans|url=http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html|archivedate=31 May 2008|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept of a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria. The principal divisions (in descending order of area) are the: [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Southern Ocean|Southern (Antarctic) Ocean]], and [[Arctic Ocean]]. Smaller regions of the oceans are called [[sea]]s, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s, [[strait]]s, and other names.

Geologically, an ocean is an area of [[oceanic crust]] covered by water. Oceanic crust is the thin layer of solidified volcanic [[basalt]] that covers the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. [[Continental crust]] is thicker but less dense. From this perspective, the Earth has three oceans: the World Ocean, the [[Caspian Sea]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and the [[Black Sea]]. The latter two were formed by the collision of [[Cimmerian plate|Cimmeria]] with [[Laurasia]]. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] is at times a discrete ocean, because [[plate tectonics|tectonic plate movement]] has repeatedly broken its connection to the World Ocean through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. The Black Sea is connected to the Mediterranean through the [[Bosporus]], but the Bosporus is a natural [[canal]] cut through continental rock some 7,000 years ago, rather than a piece of oceanic sea floor like the Strait of Gibraltar.

Despite their names, some smaller landlocked "seas" are ''not'' connected with the World Ocean, such as the [[Caspian Sea]] (which is nevertheless, geologically, itself a full-fledged ocean—see above) and numerous [[salt lake]]s such as the [[Aral Sea]].

A complete hierarchy showing which seas belong to which oceans, according to the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) and for the whole planet, is available at the European Marine Gazetteer website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marbef.org/data/gazetteer.php?p=browser European Marine Gazetteer browser], MarBEF Data System - European Marine Gazetteer&lt;/ref&gt;  See also the [[list of seas]] article for the seas included in each ocean area. Also note there are many varying definitions of the world's seas and no single authority.

==Arctic Ocean==
The [[Arctic Ocean]] covers much of the Arctic and washes upon northern [[North America]] and [[Eurasia]] and is sometimes considered a [[sea]] or [[estuary]] of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marinebio.org/oceans/ The Ocean], The MarineBio Conservation Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/33188/Arctic-Ocean Arctic Ocean], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) defines the limits of the Arctic Ocean (excluding the seas it contains) as follows:&lt;ref name="iho-ohi.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::''Between West Spitzbergen and [[Nordaustlandet|North East Land]]'' — the parallel of [[80th parallel north|lat. 80°N]].

::''From Cape Leigh Smith to [[Cape Kohlsaat]]'' — the Northern limit of [[Barents Sea|Barentsz Sea]] {{sic}}.&lt;ref group="Ar"&gt;Defined by IHO as "Cape Leigh Smith across the Islands Bolshoy Ostrov (Great Island) &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Storøya]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Gilles &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Kvitøya]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and [[Victoria Island (Russian Arctic)|Victoria]]; [[Cape Mary Harmsworth]] (Southwestern extremity of [[Alexandra Land]]) along the northern coasts of [[Franz Josef Land|Franz-Josef Land]] as far as Cape Kohlsaat ({{Coord|81|14|N|65|10|E|display=inline}})".&lt;/ref&gt;

::''From [[Cape Kohlsaat]] to [[Arctic Cape|Cape Molotov]]'' — the Northern limit of [[Kara Sea]].&lt;ref group="Ar"&gt;Defined by IHO as "Cape Kohlsaat to Cape Molotov ({{Coord|81|16|N|93|43|E|display=inline}}) (Northern extremity of [[Severnaya Zemlya]] on [[Komsomolets Island]])".&lt;/ref&gt;

::''From Cape Molotov to the Northern extremity of [[Kotelny/Faddeyevsky Island|Kotelni Island]]'' — the Northern limit of [[Laptev Sea]].&lt;ref group="Ar"&gt;Defined by IHO as "A line joining Cape Molotov to the Northern extremity of [[Kotelny/Faddeyevsky Island|Kotelni Island]] ({{Coord|76|10|N|138|50|E|display=inline}})".&lt;/ref&gt;

::''From the Northern extremity of Kotelni Island to the Northern point of [[Wrangel Island]]'' — the Northern limit of [[East Siberian Sea]].&lt;ref group="Ar"&gt;Defined by IHO as "A line from the Northernmost point of Wrangel Island (179°30'W) to the Northern sides of the [[De Long Islands]] (including [[Henrietta Island|Henrietta]] and [[Jeannette Island]]s) and [[Bennett Island]], thence to the Northern extremity of Kotelni Island".&lt;/ref&gt;

::''From the Northern point of Wrangel Island to [[Point Barrow]]'' — the Northern limit of [[Chukchi Sea|Chuckchi Sea]] {{sic}}.&lt;ref group="Ar"&gt;Defined by IHO as "A line from Point Barrow, [[Alaska]] ({{Coord|71|20|N|156|20|W|display=inline}}) to the Northernmost point of Wrangel Island (179°30'W)".&lt;/ref&gt;

::''From Point Barrow to Cape Land's End on [[Prince Patrick Island]]'' — the Northern limit of [[Beaufort Sea]],&lt;ref group="Ar"&gt;Defined by IHO as "A line from Point Barrow, Alaska, to Lands End, Prince Patrick Island ({{Coord|76|16|N|124|08|W|display=inline}})".&lt;/ref&gt; through the Northwest coast of Prince Patrick Island to Cape Leopold M'Clintock, thence to Cape Murray ([[Brook Island]]) and along the Northwest coast to the extreme Northerly point; to Cape Mackay ([[Borden Island]]); through the Northwesterly coast of Borden Island to Cape Malloch, to Cape Isachsen ([[Ellef Ringnes Island]]); to the Northwest point of [[Meighen Island]] to [[Cape Stallworthy]] ([[Axel Heiberg Island]]) to Cape Colgate the extreme West point of [[Ellesmere Island]]; through the North shore of Ellesmere Island to [[Cape Columbia]] thence a line to [[Cape Morris Jesup]] ([[Greenland]]).

Note that these definitions exclude any marginal waterbodies that are separately defined by the IHO (such as the [[Kara Sea]] and [[East Siberian Sea]]), though these are usually considered to be part of the Arctic Ocean.

The CIA defines the limits of the [[Arctic Ocean]] differently, as depicted in the map comparing its definition to the IHO's definition.

Note that these definitions exclude any marginal waterbodies that are separately defined by the IHO (such as the [[Bay of Biscay]] and [[Gulf of Guinea]]), though these are usually considered to be part of the Atlantic Ocean.

In its 2002 draft, the IHO redefined the Atlantic Ocean, moving its southern limit to 60°S, with the waters south of that line identified as the [[Southern Ocean]].

The boundary of the Indian Ocean is a constitutional issue for Australia. The Imperial South Australia Colonisation Act, 1834, which established and defined the Colony of South Australia defined South Australia’s southern limit as being the “Southern Ocean.”   This definition was carried through to Australian constitutional law upon the Federation of Australia in 1901.

The 3rd edition, currently in force, of the [[International Hydrographic Organization]]'s (IHO) ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'' defines the limits of the North Pacific Ocean (excluding the seas it contains) as follows:&lt;ref name="iho-ohi.net"/&gt;

::''On the Southwest.'' The Northeastern limit of the [[East Indian Archipelago]] from the [[Equator]] to [[Luzon|Luzon Island]].

===South Pacific===

The 3rd edition, currently in force, of the [[International Hydrographic Organization]]'s (IHO) ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'' defines the limits of the South Pacific Ocean (excluding the seas it contains) as follows:&lt;ref name="iho-ohi.net"/&gt;

::''On the West.'' From [[South East Cape|Southeast Cape]], the Southern point of [[Tasmania]], down the meridian of 146°55'E to the [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]].

(These limits have not yet been officially accepted by [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].)

::''On the South.'' The [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]].

Note that these definitions exclude any marginal waterbodies that are separately defined by the IHO (such as the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and [[Coral Sea]]), though these are usually considered to be part of the Pacific Ocean.

In its 2002 draft, the IHO redefined the Pacific Ocean, moving its southern limit to 60°S, with the waters south of that line identified as the [[Southern Ocean]]. This new definition has not yet been ratified (and, in addition, a reservation was lodged in 2003 by Australia.)&lt;ref name="Darby"/&gt; While the name "Southern Ocean" is frequently used, some geographic authorities such as the 10th edition of the World Atlas from the U.S. [[National Geographic Society]] generally show the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans continuing to Antarctica.  If and when adopted, the 2002 definition would be published in the 4th edition of ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'', re-instituting the 2nd edition's "Southern Ocean", omitted from the 3rd edition.

The [[Southern Ocean]] contains the waters that surround [[Antarctica]] and sometimes is considered an extension of Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans.&lt;ref name="iho-ohi.net"/&gt;

In 1928, the first edition of the [[International Hydrographic Organization]]'s (IHO) ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'' publication included the Southern Ocean around Antarctica.  The Southern Ocean was delineated by land-based limits - the continent of Antarctica to the south, and the continents of South America, Africa, and Australia plus [[Broughton Island, New Zealand]] in the north. The detailed land-limits used were [[Cape Horn]] in South America, [[Cape Agulhas]] in Africa, the southern coast of Australia from [[Cape Leeuwin]], Western Australia, to [[South East Cape]], Tasmania, via the western edge of the water body of [[Bass Strait]], and then Broughton Island before returning to Cape Horn.&lt;ref name=NAOO1928&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/map00340.htm |title=Map accompanying first edition of IHO Publication Limits of Oceans and Seas, Special Publication 23 |website=NOAA Photo Library |publisher= [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern limits of the Southern Ocean were moved southwards in the IHO's 1937 second edition of the ''Limits of Oceans and Seas''.  The Southern Ocean then extended from Antarctica northwards to latitude 40° south between [[Cape Agulhas]] in Africa (long. 20° east) and [[Cape Leeuwin]] in Western Australia (long. 115° east), and extended to latitude 55° south between [[Auckland Island]] of New Zealand (long. 165° or 166° east) and [[Cape Horn]] in South America (long. 67° west).&lt;!-- delineators observed from 1937 map and not obtained from written IHO description with 1937 edition, which should be sought and checked too --&gt;&lt;ref name=NAOO1937&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/map00341.htm |title=Map accompanying second edition of IHO Publication Limits of Oceans and Seas, Special Publication 23 |website=NOAA Photo Library |publisher= [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southern Ocean did not appear in the 1953 third edition because "...''the northern limits ... are difficult to lay down owing to their seasonal change ... Hydrographic Offices who issue separate publications dealing with this area are therefore left to decide their own northern limits. (Great Britain uses the Latitude of 55° South)''". Instead, in the IHO 1953 publication, the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans were extended southward, the Indian and Pacific Oceans (which had not previously touched pre 1953, as per the first and second editions) now abutted at the meridian of [[South East Cape]], and the southern limits of the [[Great Australian Bight]] and the [[Tasman Sea]] were moved northwards.&lt;ref name="IHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IHO readdressed the question of the Southern Ocean in a survey in 2000. Of its 68 member nations, 28 responded, and all responding members except [[Argentina]] agreed to redefine the ocean, reflecting the importance placed by oceanographers on ocean currents. The proposal for the name ''Southern Ocean'' won 18 votes, beating the alternative ''Antarctic Ocean''. Half of the votes supported a definition of the ocean's northern limit at [[60th parallel south|60°S]] (with no land interruptions at this latitude), with the other 14 votes cast for other definitions, mostly [[50th parallel south|50°S]], but a few for as far north as [[35th parallel south|35°S]].

The 4th edition of ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'' has yet to be published due to 'areas of concern' by several countries relating to various naming issues around the world. The IHB circulated a new draft of the 4th edition of the publication in August 2002, however there were still various changes, 60 seas were added or renamed from the 3rd edition, and even the name of the publication was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.khoa.go.kr/eng/kcom/cnt/selectContentsPage.do?cntId=31060303 |title=IHO Special Publication 23 |publisher=Korean Hydrographic and Oceanographic Administration |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reservation had also been lodged by Australia regarding the Southern Ocean limits.&lt;ref name="Darby"/&gt; Effectively, the 3rd edition (which did not delineate the Southern Ocean leaving delineation to local hydrographic offices) has yet to be superseded and IHO documents declare that it remains "currently in force."

Despite this, the 4th edition definition has ''de facto'' usage by many organisations, scientists and nations - even at times by IHO committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.iho.int/mtg_docs/rhc/HCA/HCA3/HCA3-6.3B_Report_on_IBCSO.pdf|last=Schenke|first=Hans Werner|title=Proposal for the preparation of a new International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean| conference= Third HCA Meeting, 8–10 September 2003| booktitle=IHO International Hydrographic Committee on Antarctica (HCA)|conferenceurl=http://www.iho.int/mtg_docs/rhc/HCA/HCA3/HCA3docs_list.htm |date=September 2003 |location=Monaco | publisher=[[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO)|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nations' hydrographic offices have defined their own boundaries; the United Kingdom used the [[55th parallel south|55°S parallel]] for example.&lt;ref name="IHO"/&gt;

Other sources, such as the [[National Geographic Society]], show the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] Oceans as extending to Antarctica, although articles on the National Geographic web site have begun to reference the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name=nationalgeographic&gt;{{cite web| url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/tag/southern-ocean/| title= Southern Ocean - News Watch|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], [[Cartography|cartographic]] authorities defined the Southern Ocean as including the entire body of water between Antarctica and the south coasts of Australia and [[New Zealand]]. This delineation is basically the same as the original (first) edition of the IHO publication and effectively the same as the second edition. In the second edition, the [[Great Australian Bight]] was defined as the only geographical entity between the Australian coast and the Southern Ocean. Coastal maps of [[Tasmania]] and [[South Australia]] label the sea areas as ''Southern Ocean'',&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{citation|url=http://www.hydro.gov.au/webapps/jsp/charts/charts.jsp?chart=Aus343&amp;subchart=0 |title=Chart Aus343: Australia South Coast - South Australia - Whidbey Isles to Cape Du Couedic |publisher=Australian Hydrographic Service |date=10 April 2015|accessdate=2017-05-24 }}, {{citation|url=http://www.hydro.gov.au/webapps/jsp/charts/charts.jsp?chart=Aus792&amp;subchart=0 |title=Chart Aus792: Australia - Tasmania - Trial Harbour to Low Rocky Point |publisher=Australian Hydrographic Service |date=18 July 2008 |accessdate=11 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cape Leeuwin]] in [[Western Australia]] is described as the point where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/00104%20Cape%20Leeuwin%28P-AD%29.PDF |title=- Assessment Documentation for Cape Leeuwin Lighthouse |page=11 |work=Register of Heritage Places |date=13 May 2005 |accessdate=13 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825214915/http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/00104%20Cape%20Leeuwin%28P-AD%29.PDF# |archive-date=25 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''carbanion''' is an [[anion]] in which [[carbon]] is trivalent (forms three bonds) and bears a formal negative charge in at least one significant mesomeric contributor (resonance form).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/C00804.html|title=IUPAC Gold Book - carbanion|website=goldbook.iupac.org|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absent π delocalization, carbanions assume a trigonal pyramidal, bent, or linear geometry when the carbanionic carbon is bound to three (e.g., methyl anion), two (e.g., phenyl anion), or one (e.g., acetylide anion) substituents, respectively. Formally, a carbanion is the [[conjugate base]] of a '''carbon acid''':  

:R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH + B&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;''' + HB

where B stands for the base. Carbanions have a concentration of electron density at the negatively charged carbon, which, in most cases, reacts efficiently with a variety of [[Electrophile|electrophiles]] of varying strengths, including [[Carbonyl group|carbonyl groups]], halogenating reagents (e.g., [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]] and [[Iodine|diiodine]]), and [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory|proton donors]].  A carbanion is one of several [[reactive intermediate]]s in [[organic chemistry]]. In organic synthesis, [[organolithium reagent]]s and [[Grignard reagents]] are commonly regarded as carbanions. This is a convenient approximation, although these species are almost always multinuclear clusters containing polar covalent bonds rather than true carbanions.

==Trends and occurrence==
Carbanions are typically [[nucleophilic]] and basic. The basicity and nucleophilicity of carbanions are determined by the substituents on carbon. These include
#The [[inductive effect]]. Electronegative atoms adjacent to the charge will stabilize the charge;
#The extent of [[Conjugated system|conjugation]] of the anion. [[Resonance (chemistry)|Resonance effects]] can stabilize the anion. This is especially true when the anion is stabilized as a result of [[aromaticity]].

Geometry also affects the [[orbital hybridization]] of the charge-bearing carbanion. The greater the s-character of the charge-bearing atom, the more stable the anion.

Organometallic reagents like [[butyllithium]] (hexameric cluster, [BuLi]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[methylmagnesium bromide]] (ether complex, MeMgBr(OEt)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are often referred to as "carbanions," at least in a [[retrosynthetic analysis|retrosynthetic]] sense. However, they are really clusters or complexes containing a polar covalent bond, though with electron density heavily polarized toward the carbon atom. In fact, true carbanions without stabilizing substituents are not available in the condensed phase, and these species must be studied in the gas phase.

For some time, it was not known whether simple alkyl anions could exist as free species; many theoretical studies predicted that even methanide anion CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; should be an unbound species (i.e., the [[electron affinity]] of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;• was predicted to be negative). Such a species would decompose immediately by spontaneous ejection of an electron and would therefore be too fleeting to observe directly by mass spectrometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marynick|first=Dennis S.|last2=Dixon|first2=David A.|date=1977|title=Electron Affinity of the Methyl Radical: Structures of CH3 and CH3 -|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=74|issue=2|pages=410–413|bibcode=1977PNAS...74..410M|doi=10.1073/pnas.74.2.410|jstor=66197|pmc=392297|pmid=16592384}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1978, methyl anion was unambiguously synthesized by subjecting ketene to electric discharge, and the electron affinity (EA) of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;• was determined by photoelectron spectroscopy to be +1.8 kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The structure of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; was found to be pyramidal with a 1.3 kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; inversion barrier, while CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;• was determined to be planar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellison|first=G.

However, relatively modest stabilizing effects can render them bound.  For example, cyclopropyl and cubyl anions are bound due to increased s character of the lone pair orbital, while neopentyl and phenethyl anion are also bound, as a result of negative hyperconjugation of the lone pair with the β-substituent (n&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; → σ*&lt;sub&gt;C-C&lt;/sub&gt;).  The same holds true for anions with benzylic and allylic stabilization. Gas-phase carbanions that are sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and sp hybridized are much more strongly stabilized and are often prepared directly by gas-phase deprotonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55939535|title=The encyclopedia of mass spectrometry|last=Blanksby|first=S.

In the condensed phase only carbanions that are sufficiently stabilized by delocalization have been isolated as truly ionic species. In 1984, Olmstead and [[Philip Power|Power]] presented the lithium [[crown ether]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of the triphenylmethanide carbanion from triphenylmethane, [[n-butyllithium]] and [[crown ether|12-crown-4]] (which forms a stable complex with lithium cations) at low temperatures:&lt;ref&gt;''The isolation and X-ray structures of lithium crown ether salts of the free phenyl carbanions [CHPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and [CPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'' Marilyn M.

Adding [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] to [[triphenylmethane]] (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; in DMSO of CHPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 30.6) in [[THF]] at low temperatures followed by [[crown ether|12-crown-4]] results in a red solution and the salt complex [Li(12-crown-4)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[CPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; precipitates at −20&amp;nbsp;°C. The central C–C [[bond length]]s are 145&amp;nbsp;pm with the phenyl ring propellered at an average angle of 31.2°. This propeller shape is less pronounced with a tetramethylammonium counterion.

One tool for the detection of carbanions in solution is [[proton NMR]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Simple and Convenient Method for Generation and NMR Observation of Stable Carbanions.'' Hamid S. Kasmai Journal of Chemical Education • Vol. 76 No. 6 June '''1999'''&lt;/ref&gt; A spectrum of [[cyclopentadiene]] in DMSO shows four vinylic protons at 6.5 ppm and two [[methylene bridge]] protons at 3 ppm whereas the [[cyclopentadienyl]] anion has a single resonance at 5.50 ppm.  The use of &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li NMR has provided structural and reactivity data for a variety of organolithium species.

==Carbon acids==
Any compound containing hydrogen can, in principle, undergo deprotonation to form its conjugate base. A compound is a '''''carbon acid''''' if deprotonation results in loss of a proton from a carbon atom. Compared to compounds typically considered to be acids (e.g., [[mineral acid]]s like nitric acid, or [[carboxylic acid]]s like acetic acid), carbon acids are typically many orders of magnitude weaker, although exceptions exist (see below).  For example, [[benzene]] is not an acid in the classical [[Arrhenius acid|Arrhenius]] sense, since its aqueous solutions are neutral.  Nevertheless, it is very weak [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory|Brønsted acid]] with an estimated [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of 49 which may undergo deprotonation in the presence of a superbase like the [[Schlosser's base|Lochmann–Schlosser base]] (''n''-BuLi:KO''t''-Bu).  As conjugate acid-base pairs, the factors that determine the relative stability of carbanions also determine the ordering of the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values of the corresponding carbon acids.  Furthermore, p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values allow the prediction of whether a proton transfer process will be thermodynamically favorable: In order for the deprotonation of an acidic species HA with base B&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; to be thermodynamically favorable (''K'' &gt; 1), the relationship p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(BH) &gt; p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(AH) must hold.

These values below are p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values determined in DMSO, which has a broader useful range (~0 to ~35) than values determined in water (~0 to ~15) and better reflect the basicity of the carbanions in typical organic solvents.  Values below less than 0 or greater than 35 are indirectly estimated; hence, the numerical accuracy of these values is limited.  Aqueous p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values are also commonly encountered in the literature, particularly in the context of biochemistry and enzymology. Moreover, aqueous values are often given in introductory organic chemistry textbooks for pedagogical reasons, although the issue of solvent dependence is often glossed over.  In general, p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values in water and organic solvent diverge significantly when the anion is capable of hydrogen bonding.  For instance, in the case of water, the values differ dramatically:  p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; in water of water = 15.7, while p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; in DMSO of water = 31.4,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evans.rc.fas.harvard.edu/pdf/evans_pKa_table.pdf|title=Chem 206 pKa Table|last=Evans|first=D.

On the other hand, for cyclopentadiene, the numerical values are comparable: p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;aq&lt;/sup&gt;(Cp-H) = 15, while p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;DMSO&lt;/sup&gt;(Cp-H) = 18.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''&lt;small&gt;Note that acetic acid, ammonia, aniline, ethanol, and hydrogen chloride are not carbon acids, but are common acids shown for comparison.&lt;/small&gt;'''''

As indicated by the examples above, acidity increases (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; decreases) when the negative charge is delocalized. This effect occurs when the substituents on the carbanion are unsaturated and/or electronegative.  Although carbon acids are generally thought of as acids that are much weaker than "classical" Brønsted acids like acetic acid or phenol, the cumulative (additive) effect of several electron accepting substituents can lead to acids that are as strong or stronger than the inorganic mineral acids.  For example, trinitromethane (HC(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), tricyanomethane (HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), pentacyanocyclopentadiene (HC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), and fulminic acid (HCNO) are all strong acids with aqueous p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values that indicate complete or nearly complete proton transfer to water.  Triflidic acid, with three strongly electron withdrawing triflyl groups, has an estimated p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; well below –10.  On the other end of the scale, hydrocarbons bearing only alkyl groups are thought to have p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values in the range of 55 to 65.  The range of acid dissociation constants for carbon acids thus spans over 70 orders of magnitude.

The acidity of the α-hydrogen in carbonyl compounds crucially these compounds to participate in synthetically important C–C bond-forming reactions including the [[aldol reaction]] and [[Michael reaction|Michael addition]].

==Chiral carbanions==
With the [[molecular geometry]] for a carbanion described as a [[trigonal pyramid (chemistry)|trigonal pyramid]] the question is whether or not carbanions can display [[chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], because if the activation barrier for inversion of this geometry is too low any attempt at introducing chirality will end in [[racemization]], similar to the [[nitrogen inversion]]. However, solid evidence exists that carbanions can indeed be chiral for example in research carried out with certain [[organolithium]] compounds.

The first ever evidence for the existence of chiral organolithium compounds was obtained in 1950. Reaction of chiral 2-iodooctane with sec-butyllithium in [[petroleum ether]] at −70&amp;nbsp;°C followed by reaction with [[dry ice]] yielded mostly racemic [[butyric acid|2-methylbutyric acid]] but also an amount of [[optically active]] 2-methyloctanoic acid which could only have formed from likewise optical active 2-methylheptyllithium with the carbon atom linked to lithium the carbanion:&lt;ref&gt;''FORMATION OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE 1-METHYLHEPTYLLITHIUM'' Robert L. Letsinger [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]; '''1950'''; 72(10) pp 4842 - 4842; {{DOI|10.1021/ja01166a538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChiralcarbanionsI.png|center|400px|optically active organolithium]]

On heating the reaction to 0&amp;nbsp;°C the optical activity is lost. More evidence followed in the 1960s. A reaction of the [[cis isomer]] of 2-methylcyclopropyl bromide with sec-butyllithium again followed by [[carboxylation]] with dry ice yielded cis-2-methylcyclopropylcarboxylic acid. The formation of the trans isomer would have indicated that the intermediate carbanion was unstable.&lt;ref&gt;''The Configurational Stability of cis- and trans-2-Methylcyclopropyllithium and Some Observations on the Stereochemistry of their Reactions with Bromine and Carbon Dioxide'' Douglas E.

The '''catty''', '''kati''' or '''jin''' (commonly in China) , symbol '''斤''', is a traditional Chinese unit of [[mass]] used across [[East Asia|East]] and Southeast Asia, notably for weighing food and other groceries in some [[wet markets]], [[street markets]], and shops.  Related units include the [[picul]], equal to 100 catties, and the [[tael]] (also spelled ''tahil'', in [[Malay language|Malay]]/[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), which is {{frac|16}} of a catty.  A [[stone (Chinese mass)|stone]] is a former unit used in Hong Kong equal to 120 catties and a ''gwan'' (鈞) is 30 catties.  Catty or ''kati'' is still used in South East Asia as a unit of measurement in some contexts especially by the significant [[Overseas Chinese]] populations of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore.

The catty is traditionally equivalent to around 1⅓ [[pound avoirdupois]], formalised as 604.78982 [[gram]]s in Hong Kong,&lt;ref name = "hk_law"&gt;{{cite web|title = Weights and Measures Ordinance |work = The Law of Hong Kong | url = http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/4ed2ff0cf02f2fd9c82564760077af3c?OpenDocument }}&lt;/ref&gt; 604.79&amp;nbsp;grams in Malaysia&lt;ref name="my_law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Weights and Measures Act 1972 |work=Laws of Malaysia |url=http://www.kpdnkk.gov.my/akta-timbang-dan-sukat-1972 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201182503/http://www.kpdnkk.gov.my/akta-timbang-dan-sukat-1972 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 604.8 grams in Singapore.&lt;ref name = "sg_law"&gt;{{cite web|title = Weights and Measures Act | url = http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?&amp;actno=Reved-349&amp;date=latest&amp;method=p}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, the weight has been rounded to 600&amp;nbsp;grams (Taiwan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2001/appendix6.htm Weights and Measures in Use in Taiwan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229224604/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2001/appendix6.htm# |date=2010-12-29 }} from the ''Republic of China Yearbook'' – Taiwan 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;, Japan, Korea&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mfds.go.kr/eng/eng/download.do;jsessionid=FooH3taRfU3x5etkddZGD12OQSgkSRs8P3a9LjjW29D1vmaV9cFcs50iIxHiHG3y?boardCode=17840&amp;boardSeq=70932&amp;fileSeq=2 Regulation on Approval and Notification of Herbal (crude)Medicinal Preparations, Etc.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Thailand).

'''''Cedrus''''' (common English name '''cedar''') is a genus of [[conifer]]ous [[tree]]s in the plant family [[Pinaceae]] (subfamily Abietoideae).  They are [[native plant|native]] to the mountains of the western [[Himalayas]] and the [[Mediterranean region]], occurring at altitudes of 1,500–3,200&amp;nbsp;m in the Himalayas and 1,000–2,200&amp;nbsp;m in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=farjon&gt;Farjon, A. (1990). ''Pinaceae. Drawings and Descriptions of the Genera''. Koeltz Scientific Books {{ISBN|3-87429-298-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Cedrus atlantica2.jpg|left|thumb|Foliage of Atlas cedar]]
''Cedrus'' trees can grow up to 30–40&amp;nbsp;m (occasionally 60&amp;nbsp;m) tall with spicy-resinous scented [[wood]], thick ridged or square-cracked [[Bark (botany)|bark]], and broad, level branches.  The shoots are dimorphic, with long shoots, which form the framework of the branches, and short shoots, which carry most of the leaves.  The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[evergreen]] and needle-like, 8–60&amp;nbsp;mm long, arranged in an open spiral [[phyllotaxis]] on long shoots, and in dense spiral clusters of 15–45 together on short shoots; they vary from bright grass-green to dark green to strongly glaucous pale blue-green, depending on the thickness of the white wax layer which protects the leaves from desiccation.  The [[Conifer cone|seed cones]] are barrel-shaped, 6–12&amp;nbsp;cm long and 3–8&amp;nbsp;cm broad, green maturing grey-brown, and, as in [[Fir|''Abies'']], disintegrate at maturity to release the winged [[seed]]s.  The seeds are 10–15&amp;nbsp;mm long, with a 20–30&amp;nbsp;mm wing; as in ''Abies'', the seeds have two or three resin blisters, containing an unpleasant-tasting [[resin]], thought to be a defence against [[squirrel]] predation.  Cone maturation takes one year, with pollination in autumn and the seeds maturing the same time a year later.  The [[pollen]] cones are slender ovoid, 3–8&amp;nbsp;cm long, produced in late summer, and shedding pollen in autumn.&lt;ref name=farjon/&gt;&lt;ref name=idsy&gt;Frankis, M. &amp; Lauria, F. (1994).  The maturation and dispersal of cedar cones and seeds. ''International Dendrology Society Yearbook'' 1993: 43&amp;ndash;46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Cedars share a very similar cone structure with the [[fir]]s (''Abies'') and were traditionally thought to be most closely related to them, but molecular evidence supports a basal position in the family.&lt;ref name=Liston&gt;Liston A., D.S.

** ''C. l. stenocoma'': Turkish cedar, mountains of southwest Turkey, leaves glaucous blue-green, 8–25&amp;nbsp;mm

==Ecology==
Cedars are adapted to mountainous climates; in the Mediterranean, they receive winter precipitation, mainly as snow, and summer drought, while in the western Himalaya, they receive primarily summer monsoon rainfall.&lt;ref name=farjon/&gt;

Cedars are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including [[pine processionary]] and [[turnip moth]] (recorded on deodar cedar).

==Uses==
[[File:Cedrus atlantica-Glauca-Bonsai.jpg|right|thumb|Glaucous ''Cedrus atlantica'' trained as a [[bonsai]]]]
[[File:Cedrus wood.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Cedar wood has a woody, slightly sweet scent, and a distinctive colour and grain.]]

Cedars are very popular [[ornamental tree]]s, widely used in [[horticulture]] in [[temperate]] [[climate]]s where winter temperatures do not fall below about −25&amp;nbsp;°C.  The Turkish cedar is slightly hardier, to −30&amp;nbsp;°C or just below.  Extensive mortality of planted specimens can occur in severe winters where temperatures do drop lower.&lt;ref name=odum&gt;Ødum, S. (1985).  Report on frost damage to trees in Denmark after the severe 1981/82 and 1984/85 winters.  Hørsholm Arboretum, Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt;  Areas with successful long-term cultivation include the entire Mediterranean region, western Europe north to the British Isles, southern Australia and New Zealand, and southern and western North America.

Cedar wood and cedar oil are known to be a natural repellent to moths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burfield|first1=Tony|title=Cedarwood Oils|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~nodice/new/magazine/cedar/cedar.htm|website=www.users.globalnet.co.uk|accessdate=24 August 2016|date=September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence cedar is a popular lining for modern-day [[hope chest|cedar chests]] and closets in which [[woolen]]s are stored. This specific use of cedar is mentioned in ''[[The Iliad]]'' (Book 24), referring to the cedar-roofed or lined storage chamber where Priam goes to fetch treasures to be used as ransom. However, the species typically used for cedar chests and closets in North America is ''[[Juniperus virginiana]]'', which is different from the true cedars (note also common confusion with ''Thuja'' spp. below). Cedar is also commonly used to make [[shoe trees]] as it can absorb moisture and deodorise.

Many species of cedar trees are suitable for training as bonsai. They work well with many styles, including formal and informal upright, slanting, and cascading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walston|first1=Brent|title=Cedars for Bonsai|url=https://www.evergreengardenworks.com/cedars.htm|website=evergreengardenworks.com|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, species of the genus ''[[Thuja]]'', such as [[western red cedar]], are commonly&amp;nbsp;— though mistakenly&amp;nbsp;— confused with genuine cedar, as is ''J. virginiana'', typically known as red cedar or eastern red cedar. While some naturalized species of cedar (''Cedrus'', the true cedars) can be found in the Americas, no species is native.

--&gt;

==Etymology==
Both the Latin word ''cedrus'' and the generic name ''cedrus'' are derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] κέδρος ''kédros''.  Ancient Greek and Latin used the same word, ''kédros'' and ''cedrus'', respectively, for different species of plants now classified in the genera ''Cedrus'' and ''Juniperus'' ([[juniper]]).  Species of both genera are native to the area where Greek language and culture originated, though as the word ''kédros'' does not seem to be derived from any of the languages of the [[Middle East]], it has been suggested the word may originally have applied to Greek species of juniper and was later adopted for species now classified in the genus ''Cedrus'' because of the similarity of their aromatic woods.&lt;ref&gt;Meiggs, R. 1982.  Trees and Timber in the Ancient Mediterranean World.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name was similarly applied to [[citron]] and the word [[citrus]] is derived from the same root.&lt;ref name=andrews&gt;Andrews, A. C.  1961.  Acclimatization of citrus fruits in the Mediterranean region.  ''Agricultural History'' 35: 35&amp;ndash;46.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as a loan word in English, cedar had become fixed to its [[bible|biblical]] sense of ''Cedrus'' by the time of its first recorded usage in [[Anno Domini|AD]]&amp;nbsp;1000.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "cedar" has more recently (since about 1700&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;) been applied to many other trees (such as [[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]]; in some cases the botanical name alludes to this usage, such as the genus ''[[Calocedrus]]'' (meaning "beautiful cedar"), also known as incense cedar).  Such usage is regarded by some authorities &lt;ref name=kelsey&gt;Kelsey, H. P., &amp; Dayton, W. A. (1942). ''Standardized Plant Names'', second edition. American Joint Committee on Horticultural Nomenclature. Horace McFarland Company, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; as a misapplication of the name to be discouraged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1563">A '''Centre of Endemism''' is an area in which the ranges of restricted-range species overlap,&lt;ref&gt;(Hall and Moreau, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; or a localised area which has a high occurrence of [[Endemism|endemic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, N. Institute of Conservation and Natural History of the Soutpansberg, Herbarium Soutpansbergensis.&lt;/ref&gt; Centres of endemism may overlap with [[biodiversity hotspots]] which are biogeographic regions characterized both by high levels of plant endemism ''and by serious levels of habitat loss''. The exact delineation of centres of endemism is difficult and some overlap with one another. Centres of endemism are high [[conservation priority]] areas.

==Examples of Centres of Endemism==

'''Tanzania'''

A local centre of endemism is focussed on an area of lowland forests around the plateaux inland of Lindi in SE Tanzania, with between 40 and 91 species of vascular plants which are not found elseware.&lt;ref&gt;(G. Philip Clarke 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southern Africa'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3383">''' Crown flash''' is a rarely observed [[weather]] phenomenon involving "The brightening of a thunderhead crown followed by the appearance of aurora-like streamers emanating into the clear atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corliss|first1=William|title=Lightning, Auroras, Nocturnal Lights, and Related Luminous Phenomena: A Catalog of Geophysical Anomalies|date=1982|isbn=978-0915554096}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[hypothesis]] for why the phenomenon occurs is that sunlight is reflecting off or [[Refraction|refracting]] through tiny ice crystals above the crown of a [[cumulonimbus cloud]]. These ice crystals are aligned by the strong [[electro-magnetic field|electro-magnetic]] effects around the cloud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vonnegut|first1=B|title=Orientation of Ice Crystals in the electric field of a Thunderstorm|journal=Weather|date=1965|volume=20|issue=10|pages=310–312|url=http://amasci.com/amateur/vonngt_1965.txt|doi=10.1002/j.1477-8696.1965.tb02740.x|bibcode = 1965Wthr...20..310V }}&lt;/ref&gt; so the effect may appear as a tall streamer, pillar of light, or resemble a massive flash of a [[searchlight]] / [[flashlight]] beam. When the electro-magnetic field is disturbed by electrical [[Lightning#Electrification|charging]] or discharges ([[lightning]] flashes) within the cloud, the ice crystals are re-orientated causing the light pattern to shift, at times very rapidly and appearing to 'dance' in a strikingly mechanical fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forgetomori.com/2011/science/a-new-natural-phenomenon-crown-flash/|accessdate=2015-09-03|title=A New Natural Phenomenon - Crown Flash}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect may also sometimes be known as a "leaping sundog". As with [[sundog]]s, the observer would have to be in a specific position to see the effect, which is not a self-generated light such as seen in a lightning strike or [[aurora]], but rather a changing reflection/refraction of the sunlight.

Mentioned in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=Maurice E.|last2=Gall|first2=John C.|last3=Vonnegut|first3=Bernard|title=Meteorological Phenomenon called Crown Flash|journal=Nature|date=1971|volume=231|issue=5300|page=258|doi=10.1038/231258a0|bibcode = 1971Natur.231Q.258G|pmid=16062656}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a letter to Nature slightly earlier in the same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=Maurice E|last2=Gall|first2=John C|title=Possible Newly Recognized Meteorological Phenomenon called Crown Flash|journal=Nature|date=1971|volume=229|pages=184–185|doi=10.1038/229184b0|bibcode = 1971Natur.229..184G|pmid=16059137}}&lt;/ref&gt; this [[phenomenon]] is regarded as rare and not well documented. Starting in 2009 several [[YouTube]] videos have since emerged that appear to document this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube Playlist of Crown Flashes by upload date|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwpZXX1s8mYFAqSwULeotcPI-84JKW9jk|accessdate=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diethyl ether''', or simply '''ether''', is an [[organic compound]] in the [[ether]] class with the formula {{chem|({{chem|C|2|H|5}})|2|O}}, sometimes abbreviated as {{chem|Et|2|O|}} (see [[Skeletal formula#Pseudoelement symbols| Pseudoelement symbols]]).  It is a colorless, highly [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[flammable liquid]]. It is commonly used as a [[solvent]] in laboratories and as a [[starting fluid]] for some engines. It was formerly used as a [[general anesthetic]], until non-flammable drugs were developed, such as [[halothane]]. It has been used as a [[recreational drug]] to cause [[Inhalant abuse#Administration and effects|intoxication]].

== Production ==
Most diethyl ether is produced as a byproduct of the vapor-phase [[Hydration reaction|hydration]] of [[ethylene]] to make [[ethanol]]. This process uses solid-supported [[phosphoric acid]] [[Catalysis|catalysts]] and can be adjusted to make more ether if the need arises.&lt;ref name="kirk"/&gt; Vapor-phase [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of ethanol over some [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] catalysts can give diethyl ether yields of up to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethyl Ether, Chem. Economics Handbook |year=1991 |publisher=SRI International |location=Menlo Park, Calif |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diethyl ether can be prepared both in laboratories and on an industrial scale by the acid ether synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Julius Berend|title=A Class-book of Organic Chemistry, Volume 1|year=1920|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|location=London|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jyZIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=the+structure+of+ethyl+alcohol+cohen+julius+diethyl+ether&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fA2qUselPM_koATuhoCgAw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20structure%20of%20ethyl%20alcohol%20cohen%20julius%20diethyl%20ether&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethanol]] is mixed with a strong acid, typically [[sulfuric acid]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The acid [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociates]] in the aqueous environment producing [[hydronium]] ions, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. A hydrogen ion [[Protonation|protonates]] the [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] oxygen atom of the [[ethanol]], giving the ethanol molecule a positive charge:

:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

A [[nucleophilic]] oxygen atom of unprotonated ethanol [[Single displacement reaction|displaces]] a water molecule from the protonated ([[electrophilic]]) ethanol molecule, producing water, a hydrogen ion and diethyl ether.
: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

This reaction must be carried out at temperatures lower than 150&amp;nbsp;°C in order to ensure that an elimination product ([[ethylene]]) is not a product of the reaction. At higher temperatures, ethanol will dehydrate to form ethylene. The reaction to make diethyl ether is reversible, so eventually an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between reactants and products is achieved. Getting a good yield of ether requires that ether be distilled out of the reaction mixture before it reverts to ethanol, taking advantage of [[Le Chatelier's principle]].

Another reaction that can be used for the preparation of ethers is the [[Williamson ether synthesis]], in which an [[alkoxide]] (produced by dissolving an [[alkali metal]] in the alcohol to be used) performs a [[nucleophilic substitution]] upon an [[alkyl halide]].

== Uses ==
It is particularly important as a solvent in the production of cellulose plastics such as [[cellulose acetate]].&lt;ref name="kirk"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

=== Fuel ===
Diethyl ether has a high [[cetane number]] of 85–96 and is used as a [[starting fluid]], in combination with petroleum distillates for gasoline and Diesel engines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valvoline.com/pages/products/product_detail.asp?product=38&amp;section=402 | title = Extra Strength Starting Fluid: How it Works | publisher = Valvovine | accessdate=2007-09-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222427/http://www.valvoline.com/pages/products/product_detail.asp?product=38&amp;section=402 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of its high volatility and low [[flash point]]. Ether starting fluid is sold and used in countries with cold climates, as it can help with cold starting an engine at sub-zero temperatures. For the same reason it is also used as a component of the fuel mixture for [[carbureted compression ignition model engine]]s. In this way diethyl ether is very similar to one of its precursors, [[ethanol]].

=== Laboratory uses ===
Diethyl ether is a common laboratory [[protic solvent|aprotic solvent]]. It has limited [[solubility]] in [[Water (molecule)|water]] (6.05&amp;nbsp;g/100&amp;nbsp;ml at 25&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=merckindex/&gt;) and dissolves 1.5&amp;nbsp;g/100&amp;nbsp;g (1.0&amp;nbsp;g/100&amp;nbsp;ml) water at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="water_in_ether"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, coupled with its high volatility, makes it ideal for use as the non-polar solvent in  [[liquid-liquid extraction]]. When used with an aqueous solution, the diethyl ether layer is on top as it has a lower [[density]] than the water. It is also a common solvent for the [[Grignard reaction]] in addition to other reactions involving organometallic reagents. Due to its application in the manufacturing of illicit substances, it is listed in the Table II precursor under the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] as well as substances such as [[acetone]], [[toluene]] and [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/red.pdf Microsoft Word - RedListE2007.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227224025/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/red.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anesthetic use ===
[[File:Ether monument-Boston.JPG|thumb|300px|left|Panel from monument in Boston commemorating Morton's demonstration of ether's anesthetic use.]]
[[William T. G. Morton]] participated in a public demonstration of ether anesthesia on October 16, 1846 at the [[Ether Dome]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  However, [[Crawford Williamson Long]], M.D., is now known to have demonstrated its use privately as a [[general anesthetic]] in surgery to officials in Georgia, as early as March 30, 1842, and  Long publicly demonstrated ether's use as a surgical anesthetic on six occasions before the Boston demonstration.&lt;ref name=hill&gt;Hill, John W. and Kolb, Doris K. ''Chemistry for changing times: 10th edition''. Page 257. Pearson: Prentice Hall.  Upper saddle river, New Jersey.  2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newgeorgiaencylcopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/science-medicine/crawford-long-1815-1878 | title=Crawford Long (1815-1878) | publisher=University of Georgia Press | work=New Georgia Encyclopedia | date=May 14, 2004 | accessdate=February 13, 2015 | author=Madden, M.

''Treatment of Uterine Haemorrhage''. Provincial Medicine and Surgical Journal. Vol. 1, No. 6 (Nov. 7, 1840), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Diethyl ether largely supplanted the use  of [[chloroform]] as a general anesthetic due to ether's more favorable [[therapeutic index]], that is, a greater difference between an effective dose and a potentially toxic dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Calderone, F.A. | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | year = 1935 | volume = 55 | issue= 1 | pages = 24–39 | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/reprint/55/1/24.pdf | title = STUDIES ON ETHER DOSAGE AFTER PRE-ANESTHETIC MEDICATION WITH NARCOTICS (BARBITURATES, MAGNESIUM SULPHATE AND MORPHINE)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Diethyl ether depresses the [[myocardium]] and increases tracheobronchial secretions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ether and its effects in Anesthesia |url=http://anesthesiageneral.com/ether-effects/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diethyl ether could also be mixed with other anesthetic agents such as [[chloroform]] to make [[C.E. mixture]], or chloroform and [[Ethanol|alcohol]] to make [[A.C.E. mixture]]. In the 21st century, ether is rarely used.  The use of flammable ether was displaced by nonflammable fluorinated hydrocarbon anesthetics. [[Halothane]] was the first such anesthetic developed and other currently used inhaled anesthetics, such as isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane, are halogenated ethers.&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;Morgan, G. Edward, Jr. et al. "Clinical Anesthesiology" 3rd Ed, p. 3.  New York: Mc Graw-Hill.  2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Diethyl ether was found to have undesirable side effects, such as post-anesthetic nausea and vomiting.  Modern anesthetic agents reduce these side effects.&lt;ref name=hill/&gt;

Prior to 2005 it was on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]] for use as an anesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Essential Medicines WHO Model List (revised April 2003)|location=Geneva, Switzerland|publisher=World Health Organization|website=apps.who.int|date=April 2003|accessdate=6 September 2017|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/68168/1/a80290.pdf|edition=13th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Essential Medicines WHO Model List (revised March 2005)|location=Geneva, Switzerland|publisher=World Health Organization|website=apps.who.int|date=March 2005|accessdate=6 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050805200129/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2005/a87017.pdf|archive-date=5 August 2005|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2005/a87017.pdf|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical use ===
Ether was once used in pharmaceutical formulations. A mixture of alcohol and ether, one part of diethyl ether and three parts of ethanol, was known as [[Compound spirit of ether|"Spirit of ether"]], Hoffman's [[Anodyne]] or Hoffman's Drops. In the United States this concoction was removed from the [[United States Pharmacopeia|Pharmacopeia]] at some point prior to June 1917,&lt;ref&gt;The National druggist, Volume 47, June 1917, pp.220&lt;/ref&gt; as a study published by [[William Procter, Jr.]] in the ''American Journal of Pharmacy'' as early as 1852 showed that there were differences in formulation to be found between commercial manufacturers, between international [[pharmacopoeia]], and from Hoffman’s original recipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Procter, Jr.|first=William|date=1852|title="On Hoffman’s Anodyne Liquor"|url=https://recipes.hypotheses.org/tag/hoffmans-anodyne#_ftnref1|journal=American Journal of Pharmacy|volume=28|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recreational use ===
{{See also|Ether addiction}}
The anesthetic and intoxicating effects of ether have made it a recreational drug. Diethyl ether in anesthetic dosage is an inhalant which has a long history of recreational use. One disadvantage is the high flammability, especially in conjunction with oxygen. One advantage is a well-defined margin between therapeutic and toxic doses, which means one would lose consciousness before dangerous levels of dissolved ether in blood would be reached. With a strong, dense smell, ether causes irritation to respiratory mucosa and is uncomfortable to breathe, and in overdose triggering salivation, vomiting, coughing or spasms. In concentrations of 3–5% in air, an anesthetic effect can slowly be achieved in 15–20 minutes of breathing approximately 15–20&amp;nbsp;ml of ether, depending on body weight and physical condition. Ether causes a very long excitation stage prior to blacking out.

In the 19th century and early 20th century ether drinking was popular among Polish peasants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Safety and stability ==
Diethyl ether is extremely flammable and may form explosive vapour/air mixtures.&lt;ref name=msds01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/safetyclass/SDS/GHS-Et2O.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113221658/http://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/safetyclass/SDS/GHS-Et2O.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ether is heavier than air it can collect low to the ground and the vapour may travel considerable distances to ignition sources, which does not need to be an open flame, but may be a hot plate, steam pipe, heater etc.{{r|msds01}} Vapour may be ignited by the static electricity which can build up when ether is being poured from one vessel into another. The autoignition temperature of diethyl ether is {{convert|160|C|F}}. A common practice in chemical labs is to use steam (thus limiting the temperature to {{convert|100|C|F}} ) when ether must be heated or distilled. The diffusion of diethyl ether in air is {{nowrap|9.18 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s}} (298 K, 101.325 kPa).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Ether is sensitive to light and air, tending to form explosive [[diethyl ether peroxide|peroxides]].{{r|msds01}}  Ether peroxides have a higher boiling point than ether and are contact explosives when dry.{{r|msds01}} Commercial diethyl ether is typically supplied with trace amounts of the [[antioxidant]] [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT), which reduces the formation of peroxides.  Storage over [[sodium hydroxide]] precipitates the intermediate ether hydroperoxides. Water and peroxides can be removed by either distillation from [[sodium]] and [[benzophenone]], or by passing through a column of [[activated alumina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=W. L. F.

== Description ==
Early simulations modelled the transmission system with banks of [[analog computer]]s linked by scaled-down representations of the interconnecting lines. The operator would simulate the operation of circuit breakers by physically operating their miniature replicas. As transmission systems grew in size and complexity, they could no longer be adequately represented in this manner, and computerised simulations came to the fore.

A modern DTS combines or simulates the following elements:&lt;ref name="elec_eng"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

* An [[energy management system]] (EMS): a computer system for controlling a [[power grid]]. The EMS enables remote operation of electrical equipment, such as [[circuit breaker]]s or [[transformer]]s. It also receives information transmitted back to an electricity control centre, such as the status of equipment or notification of alarms. The [[user interface]] typically displays the state of the transmission system on computerised [[one-line diagram]]s with controllable points for simulated operation of plant such as [[circuit breaker]]s or [[tap (transformer)|transformer tap-changers]].
* A [[SCADA]] (Supervisory control and data acquisition) system, which provides collection and assimilation of data from [[Electrical substation|substations]] and transmits operator instructions back to the same plant.
* A [[power flow study|load-flow study]] to calculate power flows and voltages on the transmission system and to model its responses to disturbances such as line trips, [[relay]] action, and [[electrical generator|generator]]-[[electrical load|demand]] mismatch. The model will normally extend to the limits of the system operator's region of interest, and include representations of plant such as [[power transmission lines|lines]], [[electrical generator|generators]], [[transformer]]s, [[circuit breaker]]s and [[capacitor]]s. Optionally the (sub)transient behaviour of the system can also be modelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The system may additionally provide facilities for modelling and optimising the [[economic dispatch]] of generating units. Any generation's dynamic characteristics and limits, in particular its [[voltage regulation]], maximum generation, and [[Slew rate|rate of change of output]] are usually incorporated.

== Operation ==
A DTS is frequently purchased by a customer (such as a [[transmission system operator]]) at the same time and from the same manufacturer as an [[energy management system]], and is usually designed to mimic it as closely as possible. Operational scenarios are created on the DTS to represent the operator's transmission system under a variety of conditions.&lt;ref name="elec_eng"/&gt; These may represent normal operating conditions, or be specially designed to test the student's responses to adverse circumstances, such as frequent line trips during severe weather. The DTS is administered by a team of instructors, who select scenarios and simulate operational events, monitoring the trainee's actions in response.&lt;ref name=clark&gt;

| title = Fourth International Conference on Power System Control and Management
| year = 1996
| pages =  586–591}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenarios may also represent circumstances that the system operator hopes never occur, such as complete [[power blackout|system shut-down]], and allow it to develop strategies for restoration of service (known as [[black start]]).&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;

Deficiencies in operator training were identified as a contributory cause of the [[2003 North American blackout]], a factor similarly connected to earlier power failures. The joint US-Canadian task force investigating the incident recommended mandatory periods of simulation time for operators, and validation of the models against actual system characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| title = Final Report on the August 14th Blackout
| year = 2004
| url = https://reports.energy.gov/BlackoutFinal-Web.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To enable the training simulator to respond as realistically as possible to the student's actions, the power flow study at its heart must run on a frequent time basis, such as every few seconds. The simulation may model electrical networks consisting of many thousands of nodes and containing several hundred generating units.

The station normally has one, or more of the following parts:
* [[Heat exchanger]] - to split primary and secondary side of the system
* [[Control valve]] - to regulate the flow through the heat exchanger
* Differential pressure controller - to balance the network and improve working conditions of control valve
* Strainer - to remove particles that could block heat exchanger or control valve
* Shut off valve - to stop the flow on primary side in case of service or emergency
* [[Heat meter]] - to measure energy consumption and allocate costs
* Temperature controller - to control temperature on secondary side by regulating the flow on primary side
* Temperature sensor - to sense flow and return temperatures required for temperature control 

In addition, a district heating substation may also include:
* Pump
* Safety valve
* [[Manometer]]
* [[Non-return valve]]

All elementary particles are—depending on their ''[[spin (physics)|spin]]''—either [[boson]]s or [[fermion]]s. These are differentiated via the [[spin–statistics theorem]] of [[quantum statistics]].

== Common elementary particles ==
{{main | Cosmic abundance of elements }}

According to the current models of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|big bang nucleosynthesis]], the primordial composition of visible matter of the universe should be about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium-4 (in mass). Neutrons are made up of one up and two down quarks, while protons are made of two up and one down quark. Since the other common elementary particles (such as electrons, neutrinos, or weak bosons) are so light or so rare when compared to atomic nuclei, we can neglect their mass contribution to the observable universe's total mass. Therefore, one can conclude that most of the visible mass of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, which, like all [[baryon]]s, in turn consist of up quarks and down quarks.

Some estimates imply that there are roughly {{10^|80}} baryons (almost entirely protons and neutrons) in the observable universe.&lt;ref name="heile"&gt;

== Standard Model ==
{{main|Standard Model}}
The Standard Model of particle physics contains 12 flavors of elementary [[fermion]]s, plus their corresponding [[antiparticle]]s, as well as elementary bosons that mediate the forces and the [[Higgs boson]], which was reported on July 4, 2012, as having been likely detected by the two main experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] ([[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]]). However, the Standard Model is widely considered to be a provisional theory rather than a truly fundamental one, since it is not known if it is compatible with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]]. There may be hypothetical elementary particles not described by the Standard Model, such as the [[graviton]], the particle that would carry the [[gravity|gravitational force]], and [[superpartner|sparticle]]s, [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] partners of the ordinary particles.

=== Fundamental fermions ===
{{main|Fermion}}

The 12&amp;nbsp;fundamental fermions are divided into 3&amp;nbsp;[[generation (particle physics)|generations]] of 4&amp;nbsp;particles each. Half of the fermions are [[lepton]]s, three of which have an electric charge of &amp;minus;1, called the electron ({{Subatomic particle|electron-}}), the [[muon]] ({{Subatomic particle|muon-}}), and the [[tau (particle)|tau]] ({{Subatomic particle|tau-}}), the other three leptons are [[neutrino]]s ({{Subatomic particle|electron neutrino}}, {{Subatomic particle|muon neutrino}}, {{Subatomic particle|tau neutrino}}), which are the only elementary fermions with no electric or color charge. The remaining six particles are [[quark]]s (discussed below).

====Mass====
The following table lists current measured masses and mass estimates for all the fermions, using the same scale of measure: [[Electronvolt|millions of electron-volts (MeV)]]. For example, the most accurately known quark mass is of the top quark ({{Subatomic particle|top quark}}) at 172.7&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|GeV]]/c² or 172&amp;nbsp;700&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|MeV]]/c², estimated using the [[On-shell scheme]].

Estimates of the values of quark masses depend on the version of [[quantum chromodynamics]] used to describe quark interactions. Quarks are always confined in an envelope of [[gluons]] which confer vastly greater mass to the [[mesons]] and [[baryons]] where quarks occur, so values for quark masses cannot be measured directly. Since their masses are so small compared to the effective mass of the surrounding gluons, slight differences in the calculation make large differences in the masses.

==== Antiparticles ====
{{main|Antimatter}}

There are also 12&amp;nbsp;fundamental fermionic antiparticles that correspond to these 12&amp;nbsp;particles.  For example, the [[antielectron]] (positron) ''{{Subatomic particle|antielectron}}'' is the electron's antiparticle and has an electric charge of +1.

==== Quarks ====
{{main|Quark}}

Isolated quarks and antiquarks have never been detected, a fact explained by [[Colour confinement|confinement]]. Every quark carries one of three [[color charge]]s of the [[strong interaction]]; antiquarks similarly carry anticolor. Color-charged particles interact via [[gluon]] exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via [[photon]] exchange. However, gluons are themselves color-charged, resulting in an amplification of the strong force as color-charged particles are separated. Unlike the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]], which diminishes as charged particles separate, color-charged particles feel increasing force.

However, color-charged particles may combine to form color neutral [[composite particle]]s called [[hadron]]s. A quark may pair up with an antiquark: the quark has a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor. The color and anticolor cancel out, forming a color neutral [[meson]]. Alternatively, three quarks can exist together, one quark being "red", another "blue", another "green". These three colored quarks together form a color-neutral [[baryon]]. Symmetrically, three antiquarks with the colors "antired", "antiblue" and "antigreen" can form a color-neutral [[antibaryon]].

Quarks also carry fractional [[electric charge]]s, but, since they are confined within hadrons whose charges are all integral, fractional charges have never been isolated. Note that quarks have electric charges of either +{{2/3}} or −{{1/3}}, whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges of either −{{2/3}} or +{{1/3}}.

Evidence for the existence of quarks comes from [[deep inelastic scattering]]: firing [[electron]]s at [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to determine the distribution of charge within [[nucleon]]s (which are baryons). If the charge is uniform, the [[electric field]] around the proton should be uniform and the electron should scatter elastically. Low-energy electrons do scatter in this way, but, above a particular energy, the protons deflect some electrons through large angles. The recoiling electron has much less energy and a [[jet (particle physics)|jet of particles]] is emitted. This inelastic scattering suggests that the charge in the proton is not uniform but split among smaller charged particles: quarks.

=== Fundamental bosons ===
{{main|Boson}}

In the Standard Model, vector ([[spin (physics)|spin]]-1) bosons ([[gluon]]s, [[photon]]s, and the [[W and Z bosons]]) mediate forces, whereas the [[Higgs boson]] (spin-0) is responsible for the intrinsic [[mass]] of particles. Bosons differ from fermions in the fact that multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state ([[Pauli exclusion principle]]). Also, bosons can be either elementary, like photons, or a combination, like [[meson]]s. The spin of bosons are integers instead of half integers.

==== Gluons ====
{{main|Gluon}}

Gluons mediate the [[strong interaction]], which join quarks and thereby form [[hadron]]s, which are either [[baryon]]s (three quarks) or [[meson]]s (one quark and one antiquark).  Protons and neutrons are baryons, joined by gluons to form the [[atomic nucleus]].  Like quarks, gluons exhibit [[color charge|color]] and anticolor—unrelated to the concept of visual color—sometimes in combinations, altogether eight variations of gluons.

==== Electroweak bosons ====
{{main|W and Z bosons|Photon}}

There are three [[weak gauge boson]]s: ''W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''; these mediate the [[weak interaction]]. The W bosons are known for their mediation in nuclear decay. The ''W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'' converts a neutron into a proton then decay into an electron and electron antineutrino pair. The ''Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;'' does not convert charge but rather changes momentum and is the only mechanism for elastically scattering neutrinos. The weak gauge bosons were discovered due to momentum change in electrons from neutrino-Z exchange. The massless [[photon]] mediates the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. These four gauge bosons form the electroweak interaction among elementary particles.

==== Higgs boson ====
{{main|Higgs boson}}

Although the weak and electromagnetic forces appear quite different to us at everyday energies, the two forces are theorized to unify as a single [[electroweak force]] at high energies. This prediction was clearly confirmed by measurements of cross-sections for high-energy electron-proton scattering at the [[Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage|HERA]] collider at [[DESY]].  The differences at low energies is a consequence of the high masses of the ''W'' and ''Z'' bosons, which in turn are a consequence of the [[Higgs mechanism]]. Through the process of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], the Higgs selects a special direction in electroweak space that causes three electroweak particles to become very heavy (the weak bosons) and one to remain massless (the photon). On 4 July 2012, after many years of experimentally searching for evidence of its existence, the [[Higgs boson]] was announced to have been observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. [[Peter Higgs]] who first posited the existence of the Higgs boson was present at the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[statistical significance]] of this discovery was reported as 5-sigma, which implies a certainty of roughly 99.99994%. In particle physics, this is the level of significance required to officially label experimental observations as a [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]. Research into the properties of the newly discovered particle continues.

==== Graviton ====

{{main|Graviton}}

The [[graviton]] is a hypothetical elementary spin-2 particle proposed to mediate gravitation. While it remains undiscovered due to [[Graviton#Experimental observation|the difficulty inherent in its detection]], it is sometimes included in tables of elementary particles.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"/&gt; The conventional graviton is massless, although there exist models containing massive [[Kaluza–Klein theory|Kaluza–Klein]] gravitons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0910.1535|bibcode = 2010PhLB..682..446C|title = Massless versus Kaluza-Klein gravitons at the LHC|journal = Physics Letters B|volume = 682|issue = 4–5|pages = 446–449|last1 = Calmet|first1 = Xavier|last2 = De Aquino|first2 = Priscila|last3 = Rizzo|first3 = Thomas G.|year = 2010|doi = 10.1016/j.physletb.2009.11.045|hdl = 2078/31706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beyond the Standard Model ==

Although experimental evidence overwhelmingly confirms the predictions derived from the [[Standard Model]], some of its parameters were added arbitrarily, not determined by a particular explanation, which remain mysteries, for instance the [[hierarchy problem]]. Theories [[beyond the Standard Model]] attempt to resolve these shortcomings.

=== Grand unification ===
{{main|Grand Unified Theory}}

One extension of the Standard Model attempts to combine the [[electroweak interaction]] with the [[strong interaction]] into a single 'grand unified theory' (GUT). Such a force would be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] into the three forces by a [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs-like mechanism]]. The most dramatic prediction of grand unification is the existence of [[X and Y bosons]], which cause [[proton decay]]. However, the non-observation of proton decay at the [[Super-Kamiokande]] neutrino observatory rules out the simplest GUTs, including SU(5) and SO(10).

=== Supersymmetry ===
{{main|Supersymmetry}}

Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. These symmetries exchange [[fermion]]ic particles with [[boson]]ic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of [[supersymmetric particle]]s, abbreviated as ''[[sparticle]]s'', which include the [[slepton]]s, [[squark]]s, [[neutralino]]s, and [[chargino]]s. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose [[spin (physics)|spin]] differs by {{1/2}} from the ordinary particle. Due to the [[supersymmetry breaking|breaking of supersymmetry]], the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing [[particle collider]]s would not be powerful enough to produce them. However, some physicists believe that sparticles will be detected by the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].

=== String theory ===
{{main|String theory}}

String theory is a model of physics where all "particles" that make up [[matter]] are composed of strings (measuring at the Planck length) that exist in an 11-dimensional (according to [[M-theory]], the leading version) or 12-dimensional (according to [[F-theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Cumrun Vafa. "Evidence for F-theory." ''Nucl.Phys.'' '''B'''469: 403-418,1996
[[DOI:10.1016/0550-3213(96)00172-1]]. [[arXiv]]: [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9602022 hep-th/9602022]&lt;/ref&gt;) universe.  These strings vibrate at different frequencies that determine mass, electric charge, color charge, and spin.  A string can be open (a line) or closed in a loop (a one-dimensional sphere, like a circle).  As a string moves through space it sweeps out something called a ''[[world line#World lines as a tool to describe events|world sheet]]''.  String theory predicts 1- to 10-branes (a 1-[[Membrane (M-theory)|brane]] being a string and a 10-brane being a 10-dimensional object) that prevent tears in the "fabric" of space using the [[uncertainty principle]] (e.g., the electron orbiting a hydrogen atom has the probability, albeit small, that it could be anywhere else in the universe at any given moment).

String theory proposes that our universe is merely a 4-brane, inside which exist the 3 space dimensions and the 1 time dimension that we observe.  The remaining 7 theoretical dimensions either are very tiny and curled up (and too small to be macroscopically accessible) or simply do not/cannot exist in our universe (because they exist in a grander scheme called the "[[multiverse]]" outside our known universe).

Some predictions of the string theory include existence of extremely massive counterparts of ordinary particles due to vibrational excitations of the fundamental string and existence of a massless spin-2 particle behaving like the [[graviton]].

=== Technicolor ===
{{main|Technicolor (physics)}}

Technicolor theories try to modify the Standard Model in a minimal way by introducing a new QCD-like interaction. This means one adds a new theory of so-called Techniquarks, interacting via so called Technigluons. The main idea is that the Higgs-Boson is not an elementary particle but a bound state of these objects.

=== Preon theory ===
{{main|Preon}}

According to preon theory there are one or more orders of particles more fundamental than those (or most of those) found in the Standard Model. The most fundamental of these are normally called preons, which is derived from "pre-quarks". In essence, preon theory tries to do for the Standard Model what the Standard Model did for the [[particle zoo]] that came before it. Most models assume that almost everything in the Standard Model can be explained in terms of three to half a dozen more fundamental particles and the rules that govern their interactions. Interest in preons has waned since the simplest models were experimentally ruled out in the 1980s.

=== Acceleron theory ===
Accelerons are the hypothetical [[subatomic particle]]s that integrally link the newfound mass of the [[neutrino]] to the [[dark energy]] conjectured to be accelerating the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref name=acceleron/&gt;

In theory, neutrinos are influenced by a new force resulting from their interactions with accelerons. Dark energy results as the universe tries to pull neutrinos apart.&lt;ref name=acceleron&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="699">'''FluoroPOSS''' (Fluorinated Polyhedral Oligomeric [[Silsesquioxane]]s) is a synthetic [[microfiber]] with very low surface energy, which makes it oil-repellent. Mixed with an ordinary [[polymer]], it forms a material which can be applied to other materials such as [[metal]], [[glass]], [[plastic]], [[plant fibers]] or [[leaves]]. The application process is called [[electrospinning]].

FluoroPOSS has been developed at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).

  Stuart Read, Saras Sarasvathy, Nick Dew, Robert Wiltbank, Anne-Valerie Ohlsson p204 "Consider one of the first fellows, Fábio Luiz de Oliveira Rosa. Saddened by the exodus of farmers to cities in his native Brazil, Rosa developed a cheap way to ."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Rosa attended the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, where he graduated with a degree in agronomic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;“Fabio Rosa.” 2004. The Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship. Retrieved on 5 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, after leaving school, Rosa was invited by a classmate to visit the [[Palmares do Sul]] area of the southern Brazilian state, [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. Unbeknownst to Rosa at the time, his colleague's father, Ney Azevedo, was the current mayor of Palmares and in speaking with Rosa during this visit, Azevedo was so impressed that he offered him the position of secretary of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 21. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533476-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural electrification in Palmares do Sul===
Seeking ways to improve life in the region, Rosa interviewed residents who noted the ongoing economic pressure driving rural flight from Palmares. Rosa saw that high water costs were a significant impediment for local rice farmers and that lowering these costs could improve productivity and wealth. To address the high water costs, Rosa suggested expanding rural electrification to allow more farmers to drop their own wells for irrigation rather than paying exorbitant fees for water rights held by others.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 23. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533476-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, 70 percent of rural residents in Palmares were without electricity.&lt;ref&gt;“Fabio Rosa.” 2004. The Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship. Retrieved on 5 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosa favored expanding access to electricity through an inexpensive mono-phase electrification system developed by Professor Ennio Amaral of the local Federal Technical School of Pelotas.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 22-23. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533476-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of mono-phase technology reduced the costs for distributing electricity to each of these rural households from $7,000 to $400.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, David. 2003. “Fabio Rosa: Making the Sun Shine for All.” Changemakers.net. Retrieved on 5 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this system, Rosa instituted a successful pilot project that took place between 1984 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;“Fábio Luiz de Oliveira Rosa.” 1989. Ashoka. Retrieved on 5 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, a new mayor of Palmares was elected, who ended the program.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 29. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533476-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro Luz===
In 1989, Rosa was named a fellow by [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public]] and using the organization's stipend, he continued his efforts to expand rural electrification. In 1990, along with colleague Ricardo de Souza Mello, Rosa began work on Pro Luz (Project Light) to expand the Palmares model throughout Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 31. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533476-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The program proved successful and the Brazilian government was receptive, even offering a dedicated line of credit for rural electrification programs. However, in 1992, Brazilian economic troubles led the government to reduce social spending on these types of projects. The repeated difficulties Rosa faced working through government led him to focus future efforts through private organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 31. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533476-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===S.T.A.===
In 1992, Rosa established Sistemas de Tecnologia Agroelectro (STA) to popularize [[solar energy]]. He recognized that the critical barrier to the adoption of solar energy was its high cost. Thus, he worked to make it attractive by pairing it with [[electric fencing]], which could help address Brazil's problems with [[overgrazing]]. Within several years STA had installed 700 solar powered fencing systems and Rosa "had gained national recognition as a leader in the delivery of low-cost solar energy".&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 32. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533476-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
Rosa left STA in 2001 to expand his work with a non-profit he established called the Instituto Para O Desenvolvimento De Energias Alternativas E Da Auto Sustentabilidade (IDEAAS). IDEAAS was designed to take the basic STA framework and apply it as a nonprofit model in lower income areas.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 37. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533476-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through market research and consultation with various experts, Rosa designed two enterprises using solar technology that could work through STA and IDEAAS, respectively: The Sun Shines for All and The Quiron Project.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 38. {{ISBN|978-0-19-533476-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;    The Sun Shines for All is a for-profit solar energy venture administered through STA that leases comprehensive electrification packages including solar kits and outlets to those without access to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;Mugica, Yerina. 2004. “Distributed Solar Energy in Brazil: Fabio Rosa’s Approach to Social Entrepreneurship.” University of North Carolina, Kenan-Flagler Business School. Retrieved on 5 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Quiron Project is a non-profit run through IDEEAS that is designed to improve the well-being of the rural poor in an environmentally responsible manner through solar electrification, improved agricultural management, and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Mugica, Yerina. 2004. “Distributed Solar Energy in Brazil: Fabio Rosa’s Approach to Social Entrepreneurship.” University of North Carolina, Kenan-Flagler Business School.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">In [[supersymmetry]], a '''gluino''' (symbol {{SubatomicParticle|Gluino}}) is  the hypothetical [[supersymmetric partner]] of a [[gluon]]. Should they exist, gluinos are expected by supersymmetry theorists to be [[pair production|pair produced]] in [[particle accelerator]]s such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lincoln|first1=Don|title=Supersymmetric glue: the search for gluinos|url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/supersymmetric-glue-search-gluinos|website=[[CERN]]|publisher=cms.web.cern.ch|accessdate=28 April 2016|date=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In supersymmetric theories, gluinos are [[Majorana fermion]]s and interact via the [[strong interaction|strong force]] as a color octet.&lt;ref&gt;As there are 8 gluons of different [[Colour charge|color]] combinations, there are 8 gluinos of different color combinations, too.&lt;/ref&gt; Gluinos have a [[lepton]] number 0, [[baryon]] number 0, and [[Spin (physics)|spin]] 1/2.

In models of supersymmetry that conserve [[R-parity]], gluinos decay via the strong interaction to a [[squark]] and a [[quark]], provided that an appropriate mass relation is satisfied.
The squark subsequently decays to another quark and the lightest supersymmetric particle, [[Lightest Supersymmetric Particle|LSP]] (which leaves the detector unseen).  This means that a typical signal for a gluino at a hadron collider would be four [[jet (particle physics)|jet]]s plus [[missing energy]].

However, if gluinos are lighter than squarks, 3-body decay of a gluino to a [[neutralino]] and a quark antiquark pair is kinematically accessible through an off-shell squark.

In [[theoretical physics]], the hypothetical particle called the '''graviscalar''' or '''radion''' emerges as an excitation of general relativity's [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], i.e. [[gravitational field]], but is indistinguishable from a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] in four dimensions, as shown in [[Kaluza–Klein theory]]. The [[scalar field]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; comes from a component of the metric tensor &lt;math&gt;g_{55}&lt;/math&gt; where the figure 5 labels an additional [[Five-dimensional space|fifth dimension]].  The only variations in the scalar field represent variations in the size of the extra dimension.  Also, in models with multiple extra dimensions, there exist several such particles.  Moreover, in theories with [[extended supersymmetry]], a graviscalar is usually a [[superpartner]] of the [[graviton]] that behaves as a particle with [[spin (physics)|spin]] 0.  This concept closely relates to the gauged [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs model]]s.

A '''great ellipse''' is an [[ellipse]] passing through two [[point (geometry)|points]] on a [[spheroid]] and having the same [[center (geometry)|center]] as that of the spheroid. Equivalently, it is an ellipse on the [[surface (geometry)|surface]] of a spheroid and centered on the [[origin (geometry)|origin]], or the curve formed by intersecting the spheroid by a plane through its center.&lt;ref&gt;

For points that are separated by less than about a quarter of the [[circumference of the earth]], about &lt;math&gt;10\,000\,\mathrm{km}&lt;/math&gt;, the length of the great ellipse connecting the points is close (within one part in 500,000) to the [[geodesics on an ellipsoid|geodesic distance]].&lt;ref&gt;

The great ellipse therefore is sometimes proposed as a suitable route for marine navigation, although for no extra computational effort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbertson|first1=Charles|title=Earth Section Paths|journal=Navigation|date=Spring 2012|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1-7|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/navi.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the more accurate [[Earth section paths |normal section]] may be computed.

== Introduction ==

Assume that the spheroid, an ellipsoid of revolution, has an equatorial radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and polar semi-axis &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Define the flattening &lt;math&gt;f=(a-b)/a&lt;/math&gt;, the eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e=\sqrt{f(2-f)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the second eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e'=e/(1-f)&lt;/math&gt;. Consider two points: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; at (geographic) latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; and longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; at latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi_2&lt;/math&gt; and longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt;. The connecting great ellipse (from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;) has length &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt; and has [[azimuth]]s &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt; at the two endpoints.

There are various ways to map an ellipsoid into a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in such a way as to map the great ellipse into a great circle, allowing the methods of [[great-circle navigation]] to be used:
* The ellipsoid can be stretched in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation; this maps a point of latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; on the ellipsoid to a point on the sphere with latitude &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, the [[latitude#parametric latitude|parametric latitude]].
* A point on the ellipsoid can mapped radially onto the sphere along the line connecting it with the center of the ellipsoid; this maps a point of latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; on the ellipsoid to a point on the sphere with latitude &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the [[latitude#geocentric latitude|geocentric latitude]].
* The ellipsoid can be stretched into a prolate ellipsoid with polar semi-axis &lt;math&gt;a^2/b&lt;/math&gt; and then mapped radially onto the sphere; this preserves the latitude&amp;mdash;the latitude on the sphere is &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, the [[latitude#geographic latitude|geographic latitude]].

The last method gives an easy way to generate a succession of way-points on the great ellipse connecting two known points &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Solve for the great circle between &lt;math&gt;(\phi_1,\lambda_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\phi_2,\lambda_2)&lt;/math&gt; and find the [[Great-circle navigation#Finding way-points|way-points on the great circle]]. These map into way-points on the corresponding great ellipse.

== Mapping the great ellipse to a great circle ==

If distances and headings are needed, it is simplest to use the first of the mappings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| ref = harv| doi = 10.2478/v10156-011-0040-9| title = Solutions to the direct and inverse navigation problems on the great ellipse| journal = Journal of Geodetic Science| volume = 2| issue = 3| year = 2012c| pages = 200&amp;ndash;205| last1 = Sjöberg | first1 = L. E.| bibcode = 2012JGeoS...2..200S}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In detail, the mapping is as follows (this description is taken from &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|ref = harv |year = 2014
|title = Great ellipses
|last = Karney |first = C. F. F.

|postscript = . From the documentation of GeographicLib 1.38.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;):

* The geographic latitude &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; on the ellipsoid maps to the parametric latitude &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; on the sphere, where&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;a\tan\beta = b\tan\phi.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* The longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is unchanged.
* The azimuth &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; on the ellipsoid maps to an azimuth &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; on the sphere where&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tan\alpha &amp;= \frac{\tan\gamma}{\sqrt{1-e^2\cos^2\beta}}, \\
\tan\gamma &amp;= \frac{\tan\alpha}{\sqrt{1+e'^2\cos^2\phi}},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;and the quadrants of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are the same.
* Positions on the great circle of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are parametrized by arc length &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; measured from the northward crossing of the equator. The great ellipse has a semi-axes &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \sqrt{1 - e^2\cos^2\gamma_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; is the great-circle azimuth at the northward equator crossing, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the parametric angle on the ellipse.

(A similar mapping to an auxiliary sphere is carried out in the solution of [[geodesics on an ellipsoid]]. The differences are that the azimuth &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is conserved in the mapping, while the longitude &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; maps to a "spherical" longitude &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. The equivalent ellipse used for distance calculations has semi-axes &lt;math&gt;b \sqrt{1 + e'^2\cos^2\alpha_0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.)

== Geodesic problems ==
The "indirect" (or "inverse problem") is the determination of &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;, given the positions of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

The "direct problem", is the determination of the position of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;, given &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt;.

Both the inverse and direct geodetic problems for the great ellipse may be solved by using the method in [[Earth section paths]], and setting &lt;math&gt;{V_0}&lt;/math&gt; = the position vector of A. 

=== Historical methods ===
The inverse problem is solved by computing &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_2&lt;/math&gt; and solving for the [[great-circle navigation|great-circle]] between &lt;math&gt;(\beta_1,\lambda_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\beta_2,\lambda_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
The spherical azimuths are relabeled as &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (from &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;). Thus &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; and the spherical azimuths at the equator and at &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. The azimuths of the endpoints of great ellipse, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;, are computed from &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt;.
The semi-axes of the great ellipse can be found using the value of &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Also determined as part of the solution of the great circle problem are the arc lengths, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{01}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{02}&lt;/math&gt;, measured from the equator crossing to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. The distance &lt;math&gt;s_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is found by computing the length of a portion of perimeter of the ellipse using the formula giving the [[meridian arc#Series in terms of the parametric latitude|meridian arc in terms the parametric latitude]]. In applying this formula, use the semi-axes for the great ellipse (instead of for the meridian) and substitute &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{01}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{02}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

The solution of the "direct problem", can be similarly be found (this requires, in addition, the [[Meridian arc#The inverse meridian problem for the ellipsoid|inverse meridian distance formula]]). This also enables way-points (e.g., a series of equally spaced intermediate points) to be found in the solution of the inverse problem.

'''Großwelzheim Nuclear Power Plant''', ({{lang-de|Kernkraftwerk Großwelzheim, HDR}}), was an experimental [[nuclear power plant]] consisting of one 25 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] reactor in Großwelzheim, a district of [[Karlstein am Main]].

The prototype [[boiling water reactor]], designed to produce superheated steam was under construction from 1965 to 1969, and was first connected to the power grid on October 14th, 1969. The reactor could not be run at full capacity due to structural defects in the [[Nuclear fuel|fuel elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe: [http://www-proxy2.fzk.de/fzk/groups/s/documents/internetdokument/id_053468.pdf Der Rückbau des Heißdampfreaktors (HDR) in Karlstein am Main] (PDF; 323&amp;nbsp;kB), accessed  April 23, 2013}}{{Dead link |date=January 2018|fix-attempted yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the reactor was switched off about a year and a half later on April 20, 1970.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/PRIS/CountryStatistics/ReactorDetails.aspx?current=134|title=PRIS - Reactor Details|website=www.iaea.org|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wappen_Karlstein_am_Main.svg|left|Karlstein am Main coat of arms.|thumb|214x214px]]

After the decommissioning in 1983, the plant was used for reactor safety tests until dismantling was completed in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Karlsruhe Institute of Technology: [http://www.kit.edu/downloads/Lexikon_zur_Kernenergie_2011.pdf Lexikon zur Kernenergie, Stichwort "HDR"] (PDF; 7,6&amp;nbsp;MB), Accessed January 1, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

The site also included the [[Kahl Nuclear Power Plant]], the first nuclear reactor to be built in Germany, as well as the first to be shut down. This makes the site the first in Germany where two reactors have been dismantled. 

When the community of [[Karlstein am Main]] was created in 1975, an atomic symbol was included in the municipal coat of arms, due to the two reactors present in the newly formed town.

'''Gulpur Hydropower Plant (GHPP)''' is an under construction, [[run-of-the-river]] [[hydroelectric]] generation project located on [[Poonch River]], a major tributary of [[Jhelum River]] near [[Gulpur]] in [[Kotli District]] of [[Azad Kashmir]], [[Pakistan]]. The site is about 167&amp;nbsp;km from Federal Capital [[Islamabad]] and {{convert|285|km}} from [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]'s Provincial Capital [[Lahore]] and is approachable directly from [[Islamabad]] and [[Lahore]] by a two-lane, all weather paved, partly mountainous road. The location of the Project is about 28&amp;nbsp;km upstream of [[Mangla Dam]] Reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mira-power.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Gulpur Hydropower Project is a [[run-of-the-river]] project designed for the generation of {{convert|100|MW}} consisting of two [[Kaplan-type]] turbine units with average energy output of 436 Gwh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mira-power.com/our-project/project-location/&lt;/ref&gt; Gulpur Hydropower Project is a part of least-cost energy generation plan, being executed by [[WAPDA]] to harness the indigenous hydropower resources of the country. [[WAPDA]] awarded the contract to MIRA Power Limited, a subsidiary of Korean company KOSEP, an independent power producer (IPP) being developed in private sector on BOOT basis (Build, Own, Operate and Transfer) under [[Government of Pakistan]] Policy for Power Generation Projects 2002 as adopted in [[Azad Kashmir|Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir]]. The project has the capability of generating an average annual energy of 465 GWh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mira-power.com/our-project/project-description/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and construction==
Gulpur Hydropower Project is the third independent hydropower project in [[Pakistan]]. Korean company has also been awarded other contracts to build hydropower plants in the country on BOOT basis i.e. under construction 150 MW [[Patrind Hydropower Plant]] and 100MW [[Kotli Hydropower Project]].

The sponsor of the project is [[Korean South East Power Company]] along with [[Daelim Industrial Co., Ltd.]] and [[Lotte Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd.]]. The Construction of the Project has been awarded to a joint venture between Daelim and Lotte.

Construction of Gulpur Hydropower Plant commenced in September 2014 and the project is expected to be completed in early 2019. The total cost of the project is about PKR 34 billion. Gulpur Hydropower Project is part of the least-cost energy generation plan of the [[Government of Pakistan]]. It is being executed on priority basis to harness indigenous hydropower resources to improve the ratio of hydel electricity in the national grid and help provide relief to the consumers.

On its completion, Gulpur Hydropower project will generate about 465 Gwh of inexpensive electricity annually to earn revenue of about Rs 1 billion. Being an environment friendly hydropower project, it will help reduce dependence on expensive thermal power, thereby saving foreign exchange amounting to $36 million (equivalent to Rs 3 billion) to the country. According to estimation, Gulpur hydropower project will add about Rs 10 billion per annum to the national economy through socio-economic uplift in the country caused by the project. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing the loan to Mira Power, run by three Korean companies, which will build and operate a 102MW hydropower plant.

Their distribution network for solar products covers over 1.000 distributors and wholesalers, across over 30 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enfsolar.com/directory/component/1501/ibc-solar&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products and projects==
[[File:Solar power plant Buckendorf Fränkische Schweiz.jpg|thumb|250px|''Jura Solarpark'' (43 MWp) in [[Weismain]]-Buckendorf, [[Franconian Jura]]]]
IBC Solar markets modules and components of renowned manufacturers and also distributes its own product line through domestic retail partners. While a big part of its business is generated through a network of local installation partners, the company also specializes in the planning and implementation of photovoltaic systems for large commercial clients, as well as subsequent monitoring of the systems.

For example, the company has installed a PV power station with a peak output of 13.2 Megawatt in Spain near Alicante, which has been producing electricity since 2008. This project was conducted together with the electricity provider [[Enercoop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altnergy.com/new_19_12_2008.asp IBC Solar and Enercoop Build a 13 Megawatt Solar Power Plant in Crevillente, Spain, Alternative Energy, December 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Greenpeace Energy]], a German green energy utility provider, IBC Solar planned and implemented one of the largest PV roof systems in the world on the Stuttgart trade fair center (Messe Stuttgart).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibc-solar.de/EN/pressedetail+M5d6358cd007.html New Trade Fair Complex Stuttgart: IBC Solar installs one of the largest solar roof systems in the world, company press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperations and partnerships==
IBC Solar AG has long term contracts with solar cell manufactures as well as solar panel suppliers. On a test field near the company headquarters, the company tests the long term efficiency and reliability of the modules and inverters in its portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikz-energy.de/solar-production-technology/single-view/article/quality-matters.html Quality matters, IHKZ Energy, September 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the findings from its long term testing, IBC SOLAR has defined criteria for modules and inverters with manufactures and markets these product under their own brand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarserver.de/branche/i_regelungstechnik-e.html International Control Engineering Companies, Solarserver.de ]&lt;/ref&gt;

IBC Solar’s international business has been supported by the German energy agency’s solar roof program. By providing German companies with the opportunity to show their expertise in beacon projects in international markets, dena supports the market entry of German companies. Companies interested in international projects have to apply for one of the projects the energy agency award each year. As part of the solar roof program, IBC SOLAR has installed photovoltaic systems on the roofs of the German school in Rome Lisbon.,&lt;ref&gt;http://en.dsj.co.za/export/download/dsj_pdfs/aftercare/Dena_Information.pdf Dena information on solar roof program for entering foreign markets, PDF&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan in Bangalore  In 2008 IBC solar has entered into partnership with Indian company Refex Energy to explore opportunities in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.german-info.com/press_shownews.php?pid=615 Sunny side up - Max Mueller Bhavan Bangalore gets a solar roof, German Information Center, New Delhi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Storey is one of the most cited researchers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Storey&lt;/ref&gt; Storey's research includes studies of [[enzyme]] properties, [[gene expression]], protein [[phosphorylation]], and cellular [[signal transduction]] mechanisms to seek out the basic principles of how organisms endure and flourish under extreme conditions. He is particularly known within the field of [[cryobiology]] for his studies of animals that can survive freezing, especially the frozen "frog-sicles" (''[[Rana sylvatica]]'') that have made his work popular with multiple TV shows and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

These turtles are unique as they are the only reptiles, and highest vertebrate life form, known to tolerate prolonged natural freezing of extracellular body fluids during winter hibernation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=282428|title=Hatchling turtles survive freezing during winter hibernation|year=1988|volume=85|issue=21|pmid=3186730|last1=Storey|first1=KB|last2=Storey|first2=JM|last3=Brooks|first3=SP|last4=Churchill|first4=TA|last5=Brooks|first5=RJ|pages=8350–4|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|doi=10.1073/pnas.85.21.8350}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advances may aid the development of organ cryopreservation technology.&lt;ref name=Chairs/&gt;  A second area of his research is [[metabolic rate depression]] - understanding the mechanisms by which some animals can sharply reduce their [[metabolism]] and enter a state of hypometabolism or [[torpor]] that allows them to survive over the long term under difficult environmental stresses. His studies have identified molecular mechanisms that underlie metabolic arrest across phylogeny and that support phenomena including mammalian [[hibernation]], [[estivation]], and [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]] and [[ischemia]] tolerance. Control mechanisms include [[transcription factor]] changes that alter gene expression, and reversible phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes by [[protein kinases]] and [[protein phosphatases]]. These studies across multiple species also hold key applications for medical science, particularly for preservation technologies that aim to extend the survival time of excised organs in cold or frozen storage.&lt;ref name=Chairs/&gt; Additional applications include insights into [[hyperglycemia]] in [[metabolic syndrome]] and [[diabetes]],&lt;ref&gt;http://sandrablakeslee.com/articles/ice_age_diabetes_may05.php&lt;/ref&gt; and anoxic and ischemic damage caused by [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/050523/23hibernate.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030064650/http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/050523/23hibernate.htm# |archive-date=2008-10-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Storey's lab has created several web based programs freely available for [https://www.kenstoreylab.com/research-tools/ data management, data plotting, and micro RNA analysis].

'''Landau theory''' in [[physics]] is a theory that [[Lev Landau]] introduced in an attempt to formulate a general theory of continuous (i.e., second-order) [[phase transition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ujp.bitp.kiev.ua/files/journals/53/si/53SI08p.pdf Landau L.D., Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 7, pp. 19–32 (1937)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214124950/http://www.ujp.bitp.kiev.ua/files/journals/53/si/53SI08p.pdf |date=2015-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mean-field formulation (no long-range correlation)==
{{main|Mean field theory}}

Landau was motivated to suggest that the free energy of any system should obey two conditions:

*It is analytic.
*It obeys the symmetry of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].

Given these two conditions, one can write down (in the vicinity of the critical temperature, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) a phenomenological expression for the free energy as a [[Taylor expansion]] in the [[Phase transitions#Order parameters|order parameter]].

===Ising model example===

For example, the [[Ising model]] free energy in the vicinity of the phase transition may be written as the following, where the variable &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is the coarse-grained field of spins, known as the [[Phase transition#Order parameters|order parameter]] or the total magnetization.

:&lt;math&gt; F = a + r\Psi^2 + s\Psi^4 + H\Psi + ... \,&lt;/math&gt;

We can truncate the free energy to the 4th power in &lt;math&gt; \Psi &lt;/math&gt; without losing the physics of the phase transition, but in general, there are higher order terms present.
For the system to be thermodynamically stable, the coefficient of the highest even power of the order parameter must be positive. In this case, we find that &lt;math&gt; s&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;, such that the free energy is bounded.
 
The phase transition occurs at some critical temperature &lt;math&gt; T_c &lt;/math&gt;. Noticing that the minimum in the free energy changes from &lt;math&gt; \Psi=0 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \Psi\neq0 &lt;/math&gt; when the parameter &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; changes sign, we can write the parameter &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; as a function of temperature as such:

:&lt;math&gt;r = r_0 (T - T_c) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; r_0 &lt;/math&gt; is some temperature independent constant.
The constant &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; can be safely taken to be zero because it is simply a constant shift in the free energy, which has no effect on the physics of the phase transition.

The Ising model theory of Landau first raised the order parameter to prominence. Note that the Ising model exhibits the following discrete symmetry:  If every spin in the model is flipped, such that &lt;math&gt; {S_i} \rightarrow {-S_i} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; S_i &lt;/math&gt; is the value of the &lt;math&gt; i^{th} &lt;/math&gt; spin, the Hamiltonian (and consequently the free energy) remains unchanged for zero external field &lt;math&gt; (H=0) &lt;/math&gt;.  This symmetry is reflected in the even powers of &lt;math&gt; \Psi &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt;.

===Applications===

Landau theory has been extraordinarily useful.  While the exact values of the parameters &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; were unknown, [[critical exponent]]s could still be calculated with ease, and only depend on the original assumptions of symmetry and analyticity.  For the Ising model case, the equilibrium magnetization &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; assumes the following value below the critical temperature &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi = \pm \sqrt{\frac{-r_0 (T - T_c)}{2s}}. &lt;/math&gt;

At the time, it was known experimentally that the liquid–gas coexistence curve and the ferromagnet magnetization curve both exhibited a scaling relation of the form &lt;math&gt; |T - T_c|^{\beta} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; was mysteriously the same for both systems.  This is the phenomenon of [[Phase transition|universality]].  It was also known that simple liquid–gas models are exactly mappable to simple magnetic models, which implied that the two systems possess the same symmetries.  It then followed from Landau theory why these two apparently disparate systems should have the same critical exponents, despite having different microscopic parameters.  It is now known that the phenomenon of [[Phase transition|universality]] arises for other reasons (see [[Renormalization group]]).  In fact, Landau theory predicts the incorrect critical exponents for the Ising and liquid–gas systems.

The great virtue of Landau theory is that it makes specific predictions for what kind of non-analytic behavior one should see when the underlying free energy is analytic. Then, all the non-analyticity at the critical point, the critical exponents, are because the ''equilibrium value'' of the order parameter changes non-analytically, as a square root, whenever the free energy loses its unique minimum.

The extension of Landau theory to include fluctuations in the order parameter shows that Landau theory is only strictly valid near the critical points of ordinary systems with spatial dimensions higher than 4. This is the [[upper critical dimension]], and it can be much higher than four in more finely tuned phase transition. In [[Mukhamel]]'s analysis of the isotropic Lifschitz point, the critical dimension is 8. This is because Landau theory is a [[mean field theory]], and does not include long-range correlations.

This theory does not explain non-analyticity at the critical point, but when applied to [[superfluidity|superfluid]] and superconductor phase transition, Landau's theory provided inspiration for another theory, the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]] of [[superconductivity]].

==Including long-range correlations==
Consider the Ising model free energy above. Assume that the order parameter &lt;math&gt;\Psi &lt;/math&gt; and external magnetic field, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, may have spatial variations. Now, the free energy of the system can be assumed to take the following modified form:

:&lt;math&gt; F :=  \int d^D x \ \left( a(T) + r(T) \psi^2(x) + s(T) \psi^4(x) \ + f(T) (\nabla \psi(x))^2 \ +h(x) \psi(x)\ \ + \mathcal{O}(\psi^6 ; (\nabla \psi)^4) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the total ''spatial'' dimensionality. So,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \psi(x) \rangle := \frac{\text{Tr}\ \psi(x) {\rm e}^{-\beta H}}{Z} &lt;/math&gt;

Assume that, for a ''localized'' external magnetic perturbation &lt;math&gt; h(x) \rightarrow 0 + h_0 \delta(x) &lt;/math&gt;, the order parameter takes the form &lt;math&gt; \psi(x) \rightarrow \psi_0 + \phi(x) &lt;/math&gt;. Then,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\delta \langle \psi(x) \rangle}{\delta h(0)} = \frac{\phi(x)}{h_0} = \beta \left ( \langle \psi(x) \psi(0) \rangle - \langle \psi(x) \rangle \langle \psi(0) \rangle \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the fluctuation &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; in the order parameter corresponds to the order-order correlation. Hence, neglecting this fluctuation (like in the earlier mean-field approach) corresponds to neglecting the order-order correlation, which diverges near the critical point.

One can also solve &lt;ref&gt;"Equilibrium Statistical Physics" by Michael Plischke, Birger Bergersen, Section 3.10, 3rd ed&lt;/ref&gt; for &lt;math&gt; \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, from which the scaling exponent, &lt;math&gt; \nu &lt;/math&gt;, for correlation length &lt;math&gt; \xi \sim (T-T_c)^{-\nu} &lt;/math&gt; can deduced. From these, the [[Ginzburg criterion]] for the [[upper critical dimension]] for the validity of the Ising mean-field Landau theory (the one without long-range correlation) can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt; D \ge 2 + 2 \frac{\beta}{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

In our current Ising model, mean-field Landau theory gives &lt;math&gt;\beta = 1/2 = \nu &lt;/math&gt; and so, it (the Ising mean-field Landau theory) is valid only for spatial dimensionality greater than or equal to 4 (at the marginal values of &lt;math&gt;D=4&lt;/math&gt;, there are small corrections to the exponents). This modified version of mean-field Landau theory is sometimes also referred to as the Landau-Ginzburg theory of Ising phase transitions. As a clarification, there is also a [[Landau-Ginzburg theory]] specific to superconductivity phase transition, which also includes fluctuations.

[[File:PAGASA Philippine Area of Responsibility - en.svg|thumb|240px|The Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) for tropical cyclone warnings]]
Since 1963, there have been three agencies who have named [[tropical cyclones]] within the [[Pacific Ocean|north western Pacific Ocean]] which has often resulted in a cyclone having two names. From 1945 to 2000 the US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center assigned names to tropical cyclones before the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA), took over the naming of tropical cyclones in 2000. Both agencies assigned names to tropical cyclones when they intensified into a tropical storm. Since 1963 the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA) has assigned local names to a tropical cyclone should it move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it. All three agencies that have assigned names to tropical cyclones within the Western Pacific have retired the names of significant tropical cyclones, with PAGASA retiring names if a cyclone has caused at least {{ntsp|1000000000||₱}} in damage and or have caused at least 300&amp;nbsp;deaths within the Philippines. Since 1963 the naming lists have been revised in 1979, 1985, 2001 and 2005 for various reasons including to help minimize confusion in the historical records and to remove the names that might have negative associations with real persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68aXCr9UW?url=http://web.archive.org/web/19981203133120/http://pdx.rpnet.com/pagasa/naming.htm |title=Naming of Tropical Cyclones |publisher=Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration |accessdate=June 21, 2012 |url=http://pdx.rpnet.com/pagasa/naming.htm |archivedate=June 21, 2012 |date=December 3, 1998 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gloria"&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Glenda’ originally ‘Gloria’ |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20060726-11787/%91Glenda%92_originally_%91Gloria%92 |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |author=Rivera, Blanche |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CcLRh88s?url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20060726-11787/%91Glenda%92_originally_%91Gloria%92 |archivedate=December 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this list all information with regards to intensity is taken from while the system was in the Philippine area of responsibility and is thus taken from PAGASA's archives, rather than the JTWC or JMA's archives.

[[File:SMB1495J SMRT Buses MAN NL323F.jpg|thumb|MAN NL323F operated by (Singapore) [[SMRT Buses]], [[SBS Transit]],[[Go-Ahead Singapore|Go-ahead]], and [[Tower Transit Singapore|Tower Transit]]. Bodied by [[MAN Truck &amp; Bus|MAN]] and built by [[Gemilang Coachworks]] of [[Johor]], [[Malaysia]].]]
The '''MAN NLxx3F''' is a series of [[Low-floor bus|low-floor]] [[single-decker bus|single-decker]] [[city bus]] chassis between 10.5 to 12.0 metres length,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporate.man.eu/man/media/en/content_medien/doc/global_corporate_website_1/produkte_und_services_1/man_bus_chassis_de.pdf MAN Bus chassis] ''MAN Truck &amp; Bus''&lt;/ref&gt; offered by [[MAN Truck &amp; Bus|MAN]] since 1998, with internal code ''A22''. They are based on the integral low-floor [[MAN Lion's City|MAN NLxx3 Lion's City]] (A21). Available versions since launch include NL223F, NL233F, NL243F, NL263F, NL273F, NL283F, NL313F and NL323F. [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] and [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]] versions are also available, with NL313F CNG being the most powerful.

==Operators==

===United Kingdom===
[[Wrightbus]] initially developed a bodywork for the MAN NL273F, called the [[Wright Meridian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wrightbus to body MAN A22 for new Meridian |url=http://www.busandcoach.com/newspage.aspx?id=704&amp;categoryid=0 |publisher=Busandcoach.com |date=6 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405195324/http://www.busandcoach.com/newspage.aspx?id=704&amp;categoryid=0 |archivedate=5 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first MAN chassis to be bodied by [[Wrightbus]]. A Meridian demonstrator was launched at the Coach &amp; Bus Live 2007, which entered service with [[Whitelaws]]. [[Regal Busways]], [[Reading Buses#Newbury Buses|Newbury Buses]] and [[Diamond Bus North West]] each operate an handful of [[Wright Meridian]]-bodied NL273Fs across the [[United Kingdom]]. It can only have 1 door (front entrance).

===Spain===
[[EMT Madrid]] of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] received a total of 84 [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]]-powered NL313F CNGs in 2008. They were bodied by Castrosua and Burillo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dynetek AGM 2008 |url=http://www.dynetek.com/pdf/AGMPresentation2009.pdf |publisher=Dynetek |date=23 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425112301/http://www.dynetek.com/pdf/AGMPresentation2009.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, five 10.4m NL283Fs and one [[Tata Hispano|Hispano]] Area-bodied NL283F began operating in [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[Buñol]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transporte Urbano de Santiago (Tussa), Santiago de Compostela |url=http://www.stadtbus2.de/nachrichten/n_archiv_ab_e.htm |publisher=stadtbus.de Bus Magazine |date=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transvía adquiere un Area y dos Inteas de Tata Hispano sobre bastidores de MAN y VDL |url=http://www.nexotur.com/nexobus/transvia/adquiere/area/dos/inteas/tata/hispano/bastidores/man/vdl/42237/ |publisher=Nexotur |date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===

[[File:Man Lion’s City NL323F 320HP in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|MAN NL323F operated by [[Egged (company)|Egged]] on the Temple Mount in [[Jerusalem, Israel]]]]
[[Dan Bus Company]] and [[Egged (company)|Egged]] operate a fleet of NL323Fs in [[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Haifa]].

===Singapore===
[[SMRT Buses]] of [[Singapore]] received a 12.0m [[MCV Evolution]]-bodied NL323F demonstrator in 2010 for evaluation, registered as SMB138Y. Following a successful trial, [[SMRT Buses]] placed a follow-up order of 200 buses through [[ST Kinetics]], the largest order of NL323Fs at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=More buses added to 'enhance commuting' |url=http://motoring.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20111003-302923.html |publisher=[[AsiaOne]] |date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SMRT unveils new fleet of buses |url=http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC111001-0000486/SMRT-unveils-new-fleet-of-buses |publisher=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |date=1 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005164346/http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC111001-0000486/SMRT-unveils-new-fleet-of-buses |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These production batch buses were bodied under licence by [[Gemilang Coachworks]] with the bodywork design based on the [[MAN Lion's City|MAN Lion's City Hybrid]], and entered service on 2 October 2011. In 2013, SMRT Buses placed an additional order for 202 buses with similar specifications as the first batch of buses, with minor differences in the seating configuration for later buses. A further order of 332 buses was made in 2014, with largely similar specifications as the earlier buses. 

As part of the [[Bus Contracting Model (Singapore)|Bus Contracting Model (BCM)]], some of the buses were transferred to [[Tower Transit Singapore]] and SBS Transit under the Bulim bus package and Seletar Bus Package respectively. These buses were repainted into the lush green livery. The last 26 buses to be registered from the order of 332 buses were also painted into the lush green livery prior to entering service.

In October 2016, a MAN NL323F concept bus with 3 doors was exhibited at the Singapore International Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE). Marketed as the MAN Lion's City SD 3Dr, it features a modified bodywork design based on the MAN Lion's City Hybrid, built to a low-entry configuration under licence by Gemilang Coachworks. The bus was later painted into the lush green livery and began a 6-month trial service with SMRT Buses from 19 June 2017, starting on bus service 190.

On 27 May 2018, a new service, ''Express 851e'', was launched. New MAN NL323Fs, with an emission standard of Euro VI entered service. Registered from SG1749E onwards &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://landtransportguru.net/man-nl323f-euro-6-first-production-batch/|title=MAN NL323F (Euro 6) – First Production Batch {{!}} Land Transport Guru|date=2018-05-23|work=Land Transport Guru|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, they had LTA specifications, such as Passenger Information Display LCD screens, charging ports between pairs of seats and new seat colours. These are known as the MAN A22 Euro VI, which were delivered to [[SBS Transit]], [[SMRT Buses]] and [[Go-Ahead Singapore]]. The buses came with updated MAN Lion's City SD bodywork by Gemilang Coachworks and were painted in the lush green livery under the Bus Contracting Model.

===South Korea===
[[File:Gimpo1002-MAN.jpg|thumb|MAN NL313F with [[:es:Castrosua City Versus|Castrosua City Versus]] bodywork operated by [[:ko:김포운수|Gimpo Trans Co.]] in [[South Korea]]]]
In March 2017, MAN exhibited a 12.0m [[:es:Castrosua|Castrosua]] [[:es:Castrosua City Versus|City Versus]] bodied MAN NL313F CNG concept bus with 3 doors at the 11th [[Seoul Motor Show]]. It was marketed as the MAN Lion's City CNG, despite featuring Castrosua bodywork, which has a different design with the integral [[MAN Lion's City]]'s body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MAN steps on the gas in South Korea |url=https://www.mantruckandbus.com/en/press/press-overview/MAN-steps-on-the-gas-in-South-Korea-293376.html |publisher=MAN Truck &amp; Bus |date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gimpo Trans Co. received the first delivery of NL313F CNG and began service on [[Gimpo]] City bus route 1002 in November 2017.

== Biography ==

M. A. Pai. born on 5 October 1931 in the south Indian state of [[Karnataka]], did his graduate studies in electrical engineering at the [[University of Madras]] and after completing the course in 1953, started his career as an electrical engineer at the Electric Supply Department of [[Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport]], then known as Bombay Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking.&lt;ref name="Indian fellow" /&gt; After a service of 4 years, he moved to the US in 1957 where he completed his master's degree in electrical engineering (MS) at [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1958 and continued at the institution to secure a PhD in 1961.&lt;ref name="Register - University of California"&gt;{{cite book|title=Register - University of California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA6-PA52|year=1958|publisher=University of California Press|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he joined the university as an assistant professor at [[University of California, Berkeley]]  (1961–62) before taking up Professorship at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) in 1962.&lt;ref name="Faculty profile on University of California"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://smartgrid.ucla.edu/about_people_af.html |title=Faculty profile on University of California |date=2016 |publisher=University of California Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; At UCLA, he had the opportunity to work with [[Eliahu I. Jury]], a [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal|Rufus Oldenburger laureate]] on [[discrete time]] systems, and in 1963 he returned to India to join the Electrical Engineering department of the [[Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur]] as an assistant professor.&lt;ref name="List of Retired Faculty"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/dofa/data/alpha-faculty.pdf |title=List of Retired Faculty |date=2016 |publisher=IIT Kanpur}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served the institute till 1981 during which period he held the positions of an associate professor from 1966 to 1969 and a professor thereafter till he went back to the US as a visiting professor at [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="Authors"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6730699/ |title=Authors |date=2016 |publisher=IEEE Xplore}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a stint as a consultant to the [[Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited]] from 1971 to 1979. After two years of service as a visiting faculty at Illinois, he became a regular professor in 1983 and served out his academic career to superannuate in 2003.&lt;ref name="Faculty profile on University of Illinois" /&gt; In between, he also served as a visiting professor at the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] and [[Iowa State University]] and visited India on a [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]]-[[UNDP]] program at [[Central Power Research Institute]]. Post-retirement, Illinois University made him an emeritus professor.&lt;ref name="About the author"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=ZKzf_VtJfYcC&amp;pg=PP4&amp;lpg=PP4&amp;dq=M+A+Pai+national+academy+of+sciences+India&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_TaKTPNtIq&amp;sig=AzNtW3S2JVQAAiruP9f4rfdhfOk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtoIfUyrzRAhUZMlAKHfNjANMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=M%20A%20Pai%20national%20academy%20of%20sciences%20India&amp;f=false |title=About the author |date=2016 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also serves as a consultant to [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]], advising them on ''Model Reduction and Dynamic Security of Power System''.&lt;ref name="Faculty profile on University of California" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
Pai's early researches were based on power system stability, security and model reduction and his work on ''Model Reduction of Large-Scale Power Systems'' has been reported to be of significance to field of power systems.&lt;ref name="About the author" /&gt; He is known to have introduced [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's method]] in researches on power system stability and energy functions.&lt;ref name="Indian fellow" /&gt; Introduction of computer applications in power systems is another of his contributions and a power system software he has developed is in use with several power distribution networks.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize Winners"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csirhrdg.res.in/ssb.pdf | title=Handbook of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize Winners | publisher=Council of Scientific and Industrial Research | date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he worked on [[Smart Grid]], [[Microgrid]] and [[Renewable Energy]] and how they could be integrated into the main [[electrical grid]] of a power system;&lt;ref name="Faculty profile on University of California" /&gt; earlier, at IIT Kanpur, he encouraged research on ''Control and Power''. He has also contributed in the field of industrial consultancy and has served as a member of the editorial boards of Power and Energy series of [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]].&lt;ref name="Faculty profile on University of California" /&gt;

In 1963, Pai was selected to join IIT Kanpur as one of the earliest member of the Electrical Engineering faculty. Under the guidance of economist John Kenneth Galbraith, IIT Kanpur became the first institute in India to offer Computer science education. The earliest computer courses were started at IIT Kanpur in August 1963 on an IBM 1620 system, which was flown from Princeton to Kanpur. The initiative for computer education came from the Electrical engineering department. An intense outreach program in Computer Education was established during his time at IIT Kanpur. It was during his years at IIT Kanpur, Pai published his first book, ''Computer Techniques in Power System Analysis''.&lt;ref name="Pai1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. A.

A '''motor control center''' ('''MCC''') is an assembly to control some or all [[electric motor]]s in a central location. It consists of multiple enclosed sections having a common power bus and with each section containing a combination starter, which in turn consists of [[Motor soft starter|motor starter]], [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s or [[circuit breaker]], and power [[disconnector|disconnect]].&lt;ref name="eep"&gt;{{cite web|title=Siemens Basics of Motor control centers|url=http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/res/Siemens-Basics-of-Motor-control-centers.pdf|website=electrical-engineering-portal.com|publisher=EEP - Electrical Engineering Portal|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A motor control center can also include push buttons, indicator lights, [[variable-frequency drive]]s, [[programmable logic controller]]s, and metering equipment. It may be combined with the electrical service entrance for the building.

MCC's are typically found in large commercial or industrial buildings where there are many electric motors that need to be controlled from a central location,&lt;ref name="eep"/&gt; such as a [[mechanical room]] or [[electrical room]].

==Voltage ranges==
Motor control centers are usually used for low voltage [[three-phase]] alternating current motors from 208 V to 600 V. Medium-voltage motor control centers are made for large motors running at 2300 V to around 15000 V, using vacuum contactors for switching and with separate compartments for power switching and control.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Smeaton (ed) Switchgear and Control Handbook 3rd Ed., Mc Graw Hill, New York 1997 {{ISBN|0-07-058451-6}}, chapter 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Motor control centers have been used since 1950 by the automobile manufacturing industry which used large numbers of electric motors. Today they are used in many industrial and commercial applications. Where very dusty or corrosive processes are used, the motor control center may be installed in a separate air-conditioned room, but often an MCC will be on the factory floor adjacent to the machinery controlled.

==Components==
A motor control center consists of one or more vertical metal cabinet sections with power bus and provision for plug-in mounting of individual motor controllers. Very large controllers may be bolted in place but smaller controllers can be unplugged from the cabinet for testing or maintenance. Each motor controller contains a contactor or a solid-state motor controller, overload relays to protect the  motor, fuses or a circuit breaker to provide short-circuit protection, and a disconnecting switch to isolate the motor circuit. Three-phase power enters each controller through separable connectors. The motor is wired to terminals in the controller. Motor control centers provide wire ways for field control and power cables.

==Specifications==
Each motor controller in an MCC can be specified with a range of options such as separate control transformers, pilot lamps, control switches, extra control terminal blocks, various types of thermal or solid-state overload protection relays, or various classes of power fuses or types of circuit breakers. A motor control center can either be supplied ready for the customer to connect all field wiring, or can be an engineered assembly with internal control and interlocking wiring to a central control terminal panel board or programmable controller.

==Fire protection==
Motor control centers usually sit on floors, which are often required to have a [[fire-resistance rating]]. [[Firestop]]s  may be required for cables that penetrate fire-rated floors and walls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5493">The '''Ocean Grazer''' is a conceptual energy collection platform, projected to house several [[renewable energy]] generation modules, including [[Wave power|wave energy]], [[solar energy]] and [[Wind power|wind energy]]. The development of the Ocean Grazer platform has been carried out by the [[University of Groningen]] in [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/ape/ocean-grazer-project|title=Ocean Grazer project {{!}} Advanced Production Engineering {{!}} Research {{!}} University of Groningen|website=www.rug.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the platform is currently on its version 3.0&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceangrazer.com/|title=Ocean Grazer 3.0 - Offshore renewable energy: Wind, Wave, and Storage|website=Ocean Grazer 3.0|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; centering on the [[modular design]] as opposed to the massiveness of the platform, as in the previous concepts. The majority of the harvested energy for all concepts is to be delivered by a [[Wave Energy Converter|wave energy converter]] that uses the motion of [[ocean surface wave]]s to generate [[electrical energy]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-01|title=Mechanical design and modeling of a single-piston pump for the novel power take-off system of a wave energy converter|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148116303780|journal=Renewable Energy|language=en|volume=96|pages=531–547|doi=10.1016/j.renene.2016.04.076|issn=0960-1481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wave energy converter operation ==
The operating principle of the Ocean Grazer wave energy converter is to store [[potential energy]] by creating a [[hydraulic head]], due to the differences in [[pressure]] between two [[reservoir]]s. All three concepts rely on this principle to function. The hydraulic head is created by circulating internal fluid from the lower to the upper reservoir via a novel hydro-mechanical [[Power take-off|power take off system]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; composed of distributed and coupled [[Buoy|floaters]]. Each floater is linked to a separate [[Piston|multi-piston]] [[pump]]ing system, consisting of differently sized pistons that regulate the amount of pumped fluid and that can be adapted to the surface wave conditions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-01|title=Investigating the adaptability of the multi-pump multi-piston power take-off system for a novel wave energy converter|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096014811730349X|journal=Renewable Energy|language=en|volume=111|pages=598–610|doi=10.1016/j.renene.2017.04.042|issn=0960-1481}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Check valve]] systems are needed to minimize the back flow when the pistons return to their resting position.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-07-01|title=Towards Ocean Grazer’s Modular Power Take-Off System Modeling:a Port-Hamiltonian Approach|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896317332160|journal=IFAC-PapersOnLine|language=en|volume=50|issue=1|pages=15663–15669|doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.2397|issn=2405-8963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, similar to a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plant]], once enough fluid has been stored in the upper reservoir it can be circulated through a [[Turbine|turbine system]] to generate electrical energy.

== Potential ==
There are advantages in using a device like the Ocean Grazer wave energy converter, such as:
* Renewable, clean energy production from ocean surface waves.
* The adaptability of the device with respect to the incoming wave conditions, granted by the different pumping settings in the power take off system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The storage capabilities offered by the device, allowing to generate electrical energy with a controllable output as in hydroelectric plants.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qBINDgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=info:jVutRXPdc5EJ:scholar.google.com&amp;ots=y6U1bJKlkI&amp;sig=FiyaeTI3Y_ZYNfV6cdc28ccALOs&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Progress in Renewable Energies Offshore: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Renewable Energies Offshore (RENEW2016), Lisbon, Portugal, 24-26 October 2016|last=Soares|first=C.

* The [[modular design]] and [[scalability]] (concept 2.0 onward).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
There are also disadvantages in using a device like the Ocean Grazer wave energy converter, namely:
* The installation, manufacture and production are difficult and expensive. 
* The connection to the [[Electrical grid|electricity grid]] is still an open problem, a suitable solution to deliver the generated electrical energy needs to be developed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* The moving parts, pumping systems and turbine systems in the device can create [[noise pollution]] and disrupt the habitat of different marine species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233973506|title=Ocean wave energy : current status and future prepectives [i.e. perspectives]|date=2008|publisher=Springer|others=Cruz, João.|isbn=9783540748946|location=Berlin|oclc=233973506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1842">The '''Organization for Tropical Studies''' is a network of [[ecology|ecological]] [[research station]]s in [[Costa Rica]] and South Africa in 1963.  OTS is run by a non-profit consortium of 63 [[universities]], based in the [[United States]], [[Australia]], South Africa and [[Latin America]] .  The North American Office is located at [[Duke University]], in [[Durham, North Carolina]].  OTS offers a variety of courses in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]] for high school, university, and graduate students.  Most of the coursework and research conducted at OTS stations focuses on [[tropical ecology]], and the three research stations are located in distinct [[ecozones]].

Along with [[Cocha Cashu Biological Station]] and the [[Manu Learning Centre]] in [[Peru]], and the [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]] on [[Barro Colorado Island]] in [[Panama]], the OTS research stations in general (and La Selva in particular) provide some of the most important and productive sites of [[original research]] on [[neotropical]] ecology.

OTS research stations in Costa Rica:
*[[La Selva Biological Station]]: lowland [[tropical rainforest]]
*[[Palo Verde Biological Station]]: [[tropical dry forest]]
*[[Las Cruces Biological Station]]: [[montane rainforest]] (including higher elevation [[cloud forest]]) and site of the Wilson Botanical Garden
OTS research station in South Africa:

[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Space Shuttle]] was launched with the help of two solid-fuel boosters known as [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|SRBs]]]]

A '''solid-propellant rocket''' or '''solid rocket''' is a [[rocket]] with a [[rocket engine]] that uses [[Rocket propellant#Solid propellants|solid propellants]] ([[fuel]]/[[oxidizer]]). The earliest rockets were solid-fuel rockets powered by [[gunpowder]]; they were used in warfare by the [[China|Chinese]], [[India]]ns, [[Mongol]]s and [[Persian people|Persians]], as early as the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;chapters 1–2, ''Blazing the trail: the early history of spacecraft and rocketry'', Mike Gruntman, AIAA, 2004, {{ISBN|1-56347-705-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All rockets used some form of solid or powdered [[propellant]] up until the 20th century, when [[liquid-propellant rocket]]s offered more efficient and controllable alternatives. Solid rockets are still used today in military armaments world-wide, [[model rocket]]s and on larger applications for their simplicity and reliability.

Since solid-fuel rockets can remain in storage for long periods, and then reliably launch on short notice, they have been frequently used in military applications such as [[missile]]s.  The lower performance of solid propellants (as compared to liquids) does not favor their use as primary propulsion in modern medium-to-large launch vehicles customarily used to orbit commercial satellites and launch major space probes. Solids are, however, frequently used as strap-on boosters to increase payload capacity or as spin-stabilized add-on upper stages when higher-than-normal velocities are required. Solid rockets are used as light launch vehicles for [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) payloads under 2 tons or escape payloads up to {{convert|1100|lb|kg|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LADEE/main&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/LockMart_And_ATK_Athena_Launch_Vehicles_Selected_As_A_NASA_Launch_Services_Provider_999.html|title=LockMart And ATK Athena Launch Vehicles Selected As A NASA Launch Services Provider|website=www.space-travel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts==
[[File:Solid-Fuel Rocket Diagram.svg|thumb|A simplified diagram of a solid-fuel rocket.&lt;br&gt;
1. A solid [[Rocket_propellant#Solid_propellants|fuel-oxidizer mixture]] (propellant) is packed into the rocket, with a cylindrical hole in the middle.&lt;br&gt;
2. An [[Pyrotechnic initiator|igniter]] combusts the surface of the propellant.&lt;br&gt;
3. The cylindrical hole in the propellant acts as a [[combustion chamber]].&lt;br&gt;
4. The hot exhaust is choked at the throat, which, among other things, dictates the amount of thrust produced.&lt;br&gt;
5. Exhaust exits the rocket.]]
A simple solid [[rocket motor]] consists of a casing, [[De Laval nozzle|nozzle]], grain ([[propellant charge]]), and [[igniter]].

The solid grain mass [[combustion|burns]] in a predictable fashion to produce exhaust gases. The [[propelling nozzle|nozzle]] dimensions are calculated to maintain a design [[Rocket engine#Combustion chamber|chamber]] pressure, while producing [[thrust]] from the exhaust gases.

Once ignited, a simple solid rocket motor cannot be shut off, because it contains all the ingredients necessary for combustion within the chamber in which they are burned. More advanced solid rocket motors can not only be [[throttle]]d but also be extinguished&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US8336287B1/en|title=Solid propellant rocket motor having self-extinguishing propellant grain and systems therefrom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then re-ignited by controlling the nozzle geometry or through the use of vent ports.  Also, [[pulsed rocket motors]] that burn in segments and that can be ignited upon command are available.

Modern designs may also include a steerable nozzle for guidance, [[avionics]], recovery hardware ([[parachute]]s), [[self-destruct]] mechanisms, [[Auxiliary power unit|APUs]], controllable tactical motors, controllable divert and [[attitude control]] motors, and thermal management materials.

==History==
The medieval [[Song dynasty]] Chinese invented a very primitive form of solid-propellant rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Space Science in China |last= Hu |first=Wen-Rui |year=1997 |isbn= 978-9056990237 |publication-date=August 20, 1997 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations and descriptions in the 14th century Chinese military treatise  ''[[Huolongjing]]'' by the Ming dynasty military writer and philosopher [[Jiao Yu]] confirm that the Chinese in 1232 used proto solid propellant rockets then known as "[[fire arrows]]" to drive back the Mongols during the [[Siege of Kaifeng (1234)|Siege of Kaifeng]].&lt;ref name="Greatrix 2012 1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Powered Flight: The Engineering of Aerospace Propulsion |last=Greatrix |first= David R.  |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |isbn=978-1447124849 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nielsen 1997 2–4"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Blast Off!: Rocketry for Elementary and Middle School Students P |last= Nielsen  |first= Leona |publisher= Libraries Unlimited  |year=1997 |isbn= 978-1563084386 |pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each arrow took a primitive form of a simple, solid-propellant rocket tube that was filled with gunpowder. One open end allowed the gas to escape and was attached to a long stick that acted as a guidance system for flight direction control.&lt;ref name="Nielsen 1997 2–4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greatrix 2012 1"/&gt;

Modern castable composite solid rocket motors were invented by the American aerospace engineer [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|Jack Parsons]] at [[Caltech]] in 1942 when he replaced double base propellant with roofing [[asphalt]] and [[potassium perchlorate]]. This made possible slow-burning rocket motors of adequate size and with sufficient shelf-life for [[JATO|jet-assisted take off]] applications. [[Charles Bartley]], employed at JPL (Caltech), substituted curable [[synthetic rubber]] for the gooey asphalt, creating a flexible but geometrically stable load-bearing propellant grain that bonded securely to the motor casing.  This made possible much larger solid rocket motors. Atlantic Research Corporation significantly boosted composite propellant I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; in 1954 by increasing the amount of powdered aluminium in the propellant to as much as 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= M.

The largest solid rocket motors ever built were Aerojet's three {{convert|260|in|m|order=flip|adj=on|sigfig=3}} monolithic solid motors cast in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20000033816.pdf|title = The 260 - The Largest Solid Rocket Motor Ever Tested|date = June 1999|accessdate = July 24, 2014|website = nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motors 260 SL-1 and SL-2 were {{convert|261|in|m|order=flip|sigfig=3}} in diameter,  {{convert|80|ft|8|in|m|order=flip}} long, weighed {{convert|1,858,300|lb|kg|order=flip}} and had a maximum thrust of {{convert|3.5|e6lbf|MN|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Burn duration was two minutes. The nozzle throat was large enough to walk through standing up.  The motor was capable of serving as a 1-to-1 replacement for the 8-engine Saturn I liquid-propellant first stage but was never used as such. Motor 260 SL-3 was of similar length and weight but had a maximum thrust of {{convert|5.4|e6lbf|MN|order=flip|abbr=on}} thrust and a shorter duration.

==Design==
Design begins with the total [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] required, which determines the fuel/oxidizer mass. Grain geometry and chemistry are then chosen to satisfy the required motor characteristics.

The following are chosen or solved simultaneously. The results are exact dimensions for grain, nozzle, and case geometries:
* The grain burns at a predictable rate, given its surface area and chamber pressure.
* The chamber pressure is determined by the nozzle orifice diameter and grain burn rate.
* Allowable chamber pressure is a function of casing design.
* The length of burn time is determined by the grain "web thickness".

The grain may or may not be bonded to the casing. Case-bonded motors are more difficult to design, since the deformation of the case and the grain under flight must be compatible.

Common modes of failure in solid rocket motors include fracture of the grain, failure of case bonding, and air pockets in the grain.  All of these produce an instantaneous increase in burn surface area and a corresponding increase in exhaust gas production rate and pressure, which may rupture the casing.

Another failure mode is casing [[seal (mechanical)|seal]] failure.  Seals are required in casings that have to be opened to load the grain. Once a seal fails, hot gas will erode the escape path and result in failure. This was the cause of the [[STS-51-L|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]].

==Grain geometry==
Solid rocket fuel [[deflagrates]] from the surface of exposed propellant in the combustion chamber. In this fashion, the geometry of the propellant inside the rocket motor plays an important role in the overall motor performance. As the surface of the propellant burns, the shape evolves (a subject of study in internal ballistics), most often changing the propellant surface area exposed to the combustion gases. Since the propellant volume is equal to the [[cross sectional area]] &lt;math&gt;A_s&lt;/math&gt; times the fuel length, the [[volumetric]] propellant consumption rate is the cross section area times the linear burn rate &lt;math&gt;\dot{b}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[instantaneous]] [[mass flow rate]] of combustion gases generated is equal to the volumetric rate times the fuel density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{m} = \rho \cdot A_s \cdot \dot{b}&lt;/math&gt;

Several geometric configurations are often used depending on the application and desired [[thrust curve]]:
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:circ ex.jpg|Circular bore simulation
Image:cslot ex.jpg|C-slot simulation
Image:moon ex.jpg|Moon burner simulation
Image:fino ex.jpg|5-point finocyl simulation
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* Circular bore: if in [[BATES]] configuration, produces progressive-regressive thrust curve.
* End burner: propellant burns from one axial end to other producing steady long burn, though has thermal difficulties, center of gravity (CG) shift.
* C-slot: propellant with large wedge cut out of side (along axial direction), producing fairly long regressive thrust, though has thermal difficulties and asymmetric CG characteristics.
* Moon burner: off-center circular bore produces progressive-regressive long burn, though has slight asymmetric CG characteristics
* Finocyl: usually a 5- or 6-legged star-like shape that can produce very level thrust, with a bit quicker burn than circular bore due to increased surface area.

==Casing==
The casing may be constructed from a range of materials.  Cardboard is used for small [[black powder]] model motors, whereas aluminium is used for larger composite-fuel hobby motors.  Steel was used for the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|space shuttle boosters]].  Filament-wound [[Graphite-Epoxy Motor|graphite epoxy casings]] are used for high-performance motors.

The casing must be designed to withstand the pressure and resulting stresses of the rocket motor, possibly at elevated temperature. For design, the casing is considered a [[pressure vessel]].

To protect the casing from corrosive hot gases, a sacrificial thermal liner on the inside of the casing is often implemented, which [[ablate]]s to prolong the life of the motor casing.

==Nozzle==
{{main|Rocket engine nozzle}}
A [[De Laval nozzle|convergent-divergent]] design accelerates the exhaust gas out of the nozzle to produce thrust. The nozzle must be constructed from a material that can withstand the heat of the combustion gas flow. Often, heat-resistant carbon-based materials are used, such as amorphous [[graphite]] or [[carbon-carbon]].

Some designs include directional control of the exhaust.  This can be accomplished by gimballing the nozzle, as in the Space Shuttle SRBs, by the use of jet vanes in the exhaust as in the [[V-2]] rocket, or by liquid injection thrust vectoring (LITV).

An early [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] first stage used a single motor with four [[gimbal]]led nozzles to provide pitch, yaw, and roll control.

LITV consists of injecting a liquid into the exhaust stream after the nozzle throat.  The liquid then vaporizes, and in most cases chemically reacts, adding mass flow to one side of the exhaust stream and thus providing a control moment.  For example, the [[Titan III]]C solid boosters injected [[nitrogen tetroxide]] for LITV; the tanks can be seen on the sides of the rocket between the main center stage and the boosters.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sutton, George P. | title=Rocket Propulsion Elements | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley-Interscience | date=2000 | isbn=0-471-32642-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|117,000|lb|kg|order=flip|adj=on}} Castor 120 first stage has a propellant mass fraction of 92.23% while the {{convert|31,000|lb|kg|order=flip|adj=on}} Castor 30 upper stage developed for Orbital Science's Taurus II COTS (International Space Station resupply) launch vehicle has a 91.3% propellant fraction with 2.9% graphite epoxy motor casing, 2.4% nozzle, igniter and thrust vector actuator, and 3.4% non-motor hardware including such things as payload mount, interstage adapter, cable raceway, instrumentation, etc. Castor 120 and Castor 30 are {{convert|93|and|92|in|m|2|order=flip}} in diameter, respectively, and serve as stages on the Athena IC and IIC commercial launch vehicles.  A four-stage Athena II using Castor 120s as both first and second stages became the first commercially developed launch vehicle to launch a lunar probe (''Lunar Prospector'') in 1998.

Solid rockets can provide high thrust for relatively low cost. For this reason, solids have been used as initial stages in rockets (for example the [[Space Shuttle]]), while reserving high specific impulse engines, especially less massive hydrogen-fueled engines, for higher stages. In addition, solid rockets have a long history as the final boost stage for satellites due to their simplicity, reliability, compactness and reasonably high [[Propellant mass fraction|mass fraction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/props/solid.htm Solid&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020105224630/http://www.astronautix.com/props/solid.htm |date=2002-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A spin-stabilized solid rocket motor is sometimes added when extra velocity is required, such as for a mission to a comet or the outer solar system, because a spinner does not require a guidance system (on the newly added stage). Thiokol's extensive family of mostly titanium-cased ''Star'' space motors has been widely used, especially on Delta launch vehicles and as spin-stabilized upper stages to launch satellites from the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle. ''Star'' motors have propellant fractions as high as 94.6% but add-on structures and equipment reduce the operating mass fraction by 2% or more.

Higher performing solid rocket propellants are used in large strategic missiles (as opposed to commercial launch vehicles). [[HMX]], C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a nitramine with greater energy than ammonium perchlorate, was used in the propellant of the Peacekeeper ICBM and is the main ingredient in NEPE-75 propellant used in the Trident II D-5 Fleet Ballistic Missile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/d-5-features.htm|title=Trident II D-5 Fleet Ballistic Missile FBM / SLBM - United States|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of explosive hazard that the higher energy military solid propellants containing HMX are not used in commercial launch vehicles except when the LV is an adapted ballistic missile already containing HMX propellant (Minotaur IV and V based on the retired Peacekeeper ICBMs).&lt;ref&gt;''Minotaur IV User's Guide, Release 1.0'', Orbital Sciences Corp., January 2005, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The Naval Air Weapons Station at China Lake, California, developed a new compound, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, called simply [[CL-20]] (China Lake compound &lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;20). Compared to HMX, CL-20 has 14% more energy per mass, 20% more energy per volume, and a higher oxygen-to-fuel ratio.&lt;ref name="navair.navy.mil"&gt;http://www.navair.navy.mil/techTrans/index.cfm?map=local.ccms.view.aB&amp;doc=crada.13{{dead link|date= October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the motivations for development of these very high [[energy density]] military solid propellants is to achieve mid-course exo-atmospheric ABM capability from missiles small enough to fit in existing ship-based below-deck vertical launch tubes and air-mobile truck-mounted launch tubes. CL-20 propellant compliant with Congress' 2004 insensitive munitions (IM) law has been demonstrated and may, as its cost comes down, be suitable for use in commercial launch vehicles, with a very significant increase in performance compared with the currently favored APCP solid propellants. With a specific impulse of 309 s already demonstrated by Peacekeeper's second stage using HMX propellant, the higher energy of CL-20 propellant can be expected to increase specific impulse to around 320 s in similar ICBM or launch vehicle upper stage applications, without the explosive hazard of HMX.&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Black, ''The Evolution of ROCKET TECHNOLOGY'', pp. 92-94, Native Planter, SLC, 2012, payloadz.com under ''ebook/History''&lt;/ref&gt;

An attractive attribute for military use is the ability for solid rocket propellant to remain loaded in the rocket for long durations and then be reliably launched at a moment's notice.

== Propellant families ==

=== Black powder (gunpowder) propellants ===
[[Gunpowder|Black powder]] (gunpowder) is composed of [[charcoal]] (fuel), [[potassium nitrate]] (oxidizer), and [[sulfur]] (fuel and catalyst). It is one of the oldest [[pyrotechnic]] compositions with application to rocketry. In modern times, black powder finds use in low-power model rockets (such as [[Estes Industries|Estes]] and Quest rockets),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket_Motors/Estes_Motors|title=Model Rocketry Resources and Components|accessdate=16 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asp-rocketry.com/ecommerce/Quest-Black-Powder-Model-Rocket-Engines.cfm?cat_id=88|title=Quest Black Powder Model Rocket Engines|accessdate=16 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is cheap and fairly easy to produce. The fuel grain is typically a mixture of pressed fine powder (into a solid, hard slug), with a burn rate that is highly dependent upon exact composition and operating conditions. The performance or [[specific impulse]] of black powder is low, around 80&amp;nbsp;seconds. The grain is sensitive to fracture and, therefore, catastrophic failure. Black powder does not typically find use in motors above {{convert|40|N|lbf|abbr=off}}.

=== Zinc–sulfur (ZS) propellants ===
Composed of powdered [[zinc]] metal and powdered sulfur (oxidizer), ZS or "micrograin" is another pressed propellant that does not find any practical application outside specialized amateur rocketry circles due to its poor performance (as most ZS burns outside the combustion chamber) and fast linear burn rates on the order of 2&amp;nbsp;m/s. ZS is most often employed as a novelty propellant as the rocket accelerates extremely quickly leaving a spectacular large orange fireball behind it.

=== "Candy" propellants ===
In general, [[rocket candy]] propellants are an oxidizer (typically potassium nitrate) and a sugar fuel (typically [[dextrose]], [[sorbitol]], or [[sucrose]]) that are cast into shape by gently melting the propellant constituents together and pouring or packing the [[amorphous]] [[colloid]] into a mold. Candy propellants generate a low-medium specific impulse of roughly 130&amp;nbsp;s and, thus, are used primarily by amateur and experimental rocketeers.

=== Double-base (DB) propellants ===
DB propellants are composed of two [[monopropellant]] fuel components where one typically acts as a high-energy (yet unstable) monopropellant and the other acts as a lower-energy stabilizing (and gelling) monopropellant. In typical circumstances, [[nitroglycerin]] is dissolved in a [[nitrocellulose]] gel and solidified with additives. DB propellants are implemented in applications where minimal smoke is required yet medium-high performance (I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; of roughly 235&amp;nbsp;s) is required. The addition of metal fuels (such as [[aluminium]]) can increase the performance (around 250&amp;nbsp;s), though [[metal oxide]] [[nucleation]] in the exhaust can turn the smoke opaque.

=== Composite propellants ===
A powdered oxidizer and powdered metal fuel are intimately mixed and immobilized with a rubbery binder (that also acts as a fuel). Composite propellants are often either [[ammonium nitrate]]-based (ANCP) or [[ammonium perchlorate]]-based (APCP). Ammonium nitrate composite propellant often uses [[magnesium]] and/or aluminium as fuel and delivers medium performance (I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; of about 210&amp;nbsp;s) whereas [[ammonium perchlorate composite propellant]] often uses aluminium fuel and delivers high performance (vacuum I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; up to 296&amp;nbsp;s with a single piece nozzle or 304&amp;nbsp;s with a high area ratio telescoping nozzle).&lt;ref name="spaceandtech.com"/&gt; Aluminium is used as fuel because it has a reasonable specific energy density, a high volumetric energy density, and is difficult to ignite accidentally. Composite propellants are cast, and retain their shape after the rubber binder, such as [[Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene]] (HTPB), [[cross-links]] (solidifies) with the aid of a curative additive. Because of its high performance, moderate ease of manufacturing, and moderate cost, APCP finds widespread use in space rockets, military rockets, hobby and amateur rockets, whereas cheaper and less efficient ANCP finds use in amateur rocketry and [[gas generator]]s. [[Ammonium dinitramide]], NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is being considered as a 1-to-1 chlorine-free substitute for ammonium perchlorate in composite propellants. Unlike ammonium nitrate, ADN can be substituted for AP without a loss in motor performance.

Polyurethane-bound aluminium-APCP solid fuel was used in the submarine launched [[Polaris missile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/slbm/a-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; APCP used in the space shuttle [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters|Solid Rocket Boosters]] consisted of ammonium perchlorate (oxidizer, 69.6% by weight), aluminium (fuel, 16%), iron oxide (a catalyst, 0.4%), polybutadiene acrylonitrile (PBAN) polymer (a non-urethane rubber binder that held the mixture together and acted as secondary fuel, 12.04%), and an epoxy [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] agent (1.96%).&lt;ref name="sts-newsref-srb"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/srb.html | title = Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters | publisher = NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="returntoflight-system-SRB"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/returntoflight/system/system_SRB.html | title = Solid Rocket Boosters | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It developed a specific impulse of 242 seconds (2.37&amp;nbsp;km/s) at sea level or 268 seconds (2.63&amp;nbsp;km/s) in a vacuum.  The 2005-2009 [[Constellation Program]] was to use a similar PBAN-bound APCP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NASA Tests Engine With an Uncertain Future |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/science/space/31rocket.html?hpw |work=[[New York Times]] |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-31 | first=Kenneth | last=Chang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a group succeeded in creating a propellant of [[water]] and nanoaluminium ([[ALICE (propellant)|ALICE]]).

=== High-energy composite (HEC) propellants ===
Typical HEC propellants start with a standard composite propellant mixture (such as APCP) and add a high-energy explosive to the mix. This extra component usually is in the form of small crystals of [[RDX]] or [[HMX]], both of which have higher energy than ammonium perchlorate. Despite a modest increase in specific impulse, implementation is limited due to the increased hazards of the high-explosive additives.

=== Composite modified double base propellants ===
Composite modified double base propellants start with a nitrocellulose/nitroglycerin double base propellant as a binder and add solids (typically [[ammonium perchlorate]] (AP) and powdered [[aluminium]]) normally used in composite propellants. The ammonium perchlorate makes up the oxygen deficit introduced by using [[nitrocellulose]], improving the overall specific impulse. The aluminium improves specific impulse as well as combustion stability. High performing propellants such as [[NEPE-75]] used to fuel the [[UGM-133 Trident II#Design|Trident II]] D-5, [[SLBM]] replace most of the AP with [[polyethylene glycol]]-bound [[HMX]], further increasing specific impulse. The mixing of composite and double base propellant ingredients has become so common as to blur the functional definition of double base propellants.

=== Minimum-signature (''smokeless'') propellants ===
One of the most active areas of solid propellant research is the development of high-energy, minimum-signature propellant using C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; [[Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane|CL-20 nitroamine]] ([[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake|China Lake]] compound #20), which has 14% higher energy per mass and 20% higher energy density than HMX. The new propellant has been successfully developed and tested in tactical rocket motors. The propellant is non-polluting: acid-free, solid particulates-free, and lead-free.  It is also smokeless and has only a faint shock diamond pattern that is visible in the otherwise transparent exhaust. Without the bright flame and dense smoke trail produced by the burning of aluminized propellants, these smokeless propellants all but eliminate the risk of giving away the positions from which the missiles are fired. The new CL-20 propellant is shock-insensitive (hazard class 1.3) as opposed to current HMX smokeless propellants which are highly detonable (hazard class 1.1). CL-20 is considered a major breakthrough in solid rocket propellant technology but has yet to see widespread use because costs remain high.&lt;ref name="navair.navy.mil"/&gt;

=== Electric solid propellants ===
Electric solid propellants (ESPs) are a family of high performance [[plastisol]] solid propellants that can be ignited and throttled by the application of electric current. Unlike conventional rocket motor propellants that are difficult to control and extinguish, ESPs can be ignited reliably at precise intervals and durations. It requires no moving parts and the propellant is insensitive to flames or electrical sparks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2013-4168|title=Electrical Solid Propellants: A Safe, Micro to Macro Propulsion Technology|first1=Wayne N.|last1=Sawka|first2=Michael|last2=McPherson|date=12 July 2013|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|doi=10.2514/6.2013-4168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hobby and amateur rocketry==
Solid propellant rocket motors can be bought for use in [[model rocket]]ry; they are normally small cylinders of black powder fuel with an integral [[nozzle]] and sometimes a small charge that is set off when the propellant is exhausted after a time delay.  This charge can be used to trigger a [[camera]], or deploy a [[parachute]]. Without this charge and delay, the motor may ignite a second [[multistage rocket|stage]] (black powder only).

In mid- and [[high-power rocketry]], commercially made APCP motors are widely used. They can be designed as either single-use or reloadables. These motors are available in impulse ranges from "D" to "O", from several manufacturers. They are manufactured in standardized diameters, and varying lengths depending on required impulse. Standard motor diameters are 13, 18, 24, 29, 38, 54, 75, 98, and 150 millimeters. Different propellant formulations are available to produce different thrust profiles, as well as "special effects" such as colored flames, smoke trails, or large quantities of sparks (produced by adding [[titanium]] sponge to the mix).

Solid fuel is also used for some upper stages, particularly the [[Star 37]] (sometimes referred to as the "Burner" upper stage) and the [[Star 48]] (sometimes referred to as the "[[Payload Assist Module]]", or PAM), both manufactured originally by [[Thiokol]], and today by [[Orbital ATK]]. They are used to lift large payloads to intended orbits (such as the [[Global Positioning System]] satellites), or smaller payloads to interplanetary—or even interstellar—trajectories. Another solid-fuel upper stage, used by the [[Space Shuttle]] and the [[Titan IV]], was the [[Boeing]]-manufactured [[Inertial Upper Stage]] (IUS).

In [[chemistry]], the '''square antiprismatic molecular geometry''' describes the shape of compounds where eight atoms, groups of atoms, or [[ligand]]s are arranged around a central atom, defining the vertices of a [[square antiprism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aspects of the Stereochemistry of Eight-Coordination|pages=179–249|author=D.

Like with other high coordination numbers, eight-coordinate compounds are often distorted from idealized geometries, as illustrated by the structure of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TaF&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.  In this case, with the small Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, [[lattice energy|lattice forces]] are strong.  With the diatomic cation NO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the lattice forces are weaker, such as in (NO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;XeF&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, which crystallizes with a more idealized square antiprismatic geometry.

'''''Stonehenge in its landscape: Twentieth century excavations''''' by Rosamund M. J. Cleal, Karen E. Walker and Rebecca Montague is an archaeological report on [[Stonehenge]] published in 1995.  It presented the results of a two-year intensive study of all the known records of the various excavations at Stonehenge in the twentieth century, including a rephasing of the development of the monument.

Unlike popular books on the subject, ''Stonehenge in its landscape'' details the complex archaeological [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphy]] of the site. It has been described as "an essential reference work for the specialist".&lt;ref&gt;Case 1997, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

In 1993, both the setting and the presentation of Stonehenge was described as "a national disgrace" by the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Public Accounts Committee. The criticisms were several: two major roads ran close to the monument, one of which cut the processional [[Avenue (archaeology)|Avenue]]; a large car park lay nearby; the pedestrian access to the monument was via a shabby underpass, and the visitor facilities were very limited, with no visitor centre.  In addition, there was no proper plan of the monument.&lt;ref&gt;Chippindale 1995, 865&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentation of the site was in a similarly poor state. Professor [[Richard J. C. Atkinson]] had published a partial account of the site in 1956, and this had been revised in 1979, but after nearly 90 years of archaeological investigations at the monument there was still no definitive publication presenting the complex [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphy]] and the finds recovered from the site.&lt;ref&gt;Case 1997, 161-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 English Heritage commissioned [[Wessex Archaeology]] to prepare such a volume.  The work involved detailed study of all available site records, including plans, photographs, site notebooks, letters and other documentary sources, as well as analysis of all the finds from the site, and a new suite of [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] for the monument. The volume aimed to relate the site to its local landscape.

==Contents==

The volume is split into four parts.  Part 1 deals with the geography and history of Stonehenge, including previous work at the site, and the site in its modern setting.  Part 2, entitled ''Stonehenge, the monument in its setting'' tackles the [[Mesolithic]] and earlier [[Neolithic]] evidence from the site, and then moves on to describe the development of the monument, including the three major phases of development, and the post-[[Bronze Age]] use of the site.  Part 3 deals with the artefacts and ecofacts (environmental data), and Part 4 is the discussion section.

The analysis showed that Atkinson's phasing of the monument no longer held, and a new scheme was set out:

*'''Phase 1, c.2950-2900 BC'''
**Construction of ditch, inner bank, outer counterscarp bank
**Construction of [[Aubrey Holes]] (interpreted as a ring of posts)
**Primary fill accumulated in the ditch, and an organic layer over it
*'''Phase 2, c.2900-2400 BC'''
**Secondary ditch fill accumulated, including some deliberate backfill
**Post settings within the earthwork from the centre towards the southern entrance; also in the northeast entrance
**Towards the end of the phase, cremations put in the partially filled Aubrey Holes and the upper ditch, and on and just inside the inner bank
*'''Phase 3, c.2550-1600 BC'''
**3i: Bluestones set up in the Q and R Holes and then dismantled
**3ii: Construction of the sarsen circle and the trilithons.  Possibly coeval with 3iii
**3iii: Construction of another bluestone setting which included bluestone trilithons. Possibly coeval with 3ii
**3iv: Rearranged bluestones then set in a circle and oval
**3v: The oval later rearranged to form a bluestone horseshoe
**3vi: Digging of Y and Z Holes to take stones (presumed bluestones) but these were left unfilled
The Avenue was also constructed during Phase 3.&lt;ref&gt;Cleal, Walker and Montague 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==

The book was launched at the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in London on 5 October 1995.  One reviewer wryly noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If this book were a new car - such is its importance - it would have descended from the clouds amidst lasers, escorted by angelic supermodels.  Instead, it was launched at the Society of Antiquaries with tea and biscuits.  Such is the world.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts 1996, 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewers described the monograph as "a massive achievement", "fundamental" and "one of the more important British archaeological publications this century". The original edition had a print run of just 800 copies;&lt;ref&gt;Whittle 1996, 463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North 1996, 592&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case 1997, 161&lt;/ref&gt; the volume was reprinted in 2006.

==Overview==
CYRQ Energy, a [[United States]]-based energy and technology company, has carried out feasibility studies for a geothermal power station at the project site. The results of those studies support the development of an economically viable power station, with capacity of 330 megawatts.&lt;ref name="1R"/&gt;

The power station, to be developed in phases, will start with capacity of 75 megawatts. subsequent phases will raise output to 330 megawatts. The energy from this power station is expected to be sold to [[Kenya Power and Lighting Company]], under a 25 year power purchase agreement.&lt;ref name="1R"/&gt;

==Timetable and funding==
As of October 2018, the station owner/developers have submitted requests to install the power station at the development site. When those requests are approved, construction of the first phase is expected to follow and take an estimated three to four years. Later phases of the development would then follow. The entire development is estimated to cost KSh30 billion (US$3 billion), financed through equity and debt.&lt;ref name="1R"/&gt;

==Ownership==
The power station is owned by the company that is developing it; CYRQ Energy,&lt;ref name="1R"/&gt; headquartered in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].&lt;ref name="4R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=29 October 2018 | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7337534 |title=Company Overview of Cyrq Energy, Inc. | date=29 October 2018 |publisher=[[Bloomberg.com]] | author=Bloomberg LP |location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''tip-speed ratio''', X, or '''TSR''' for [[wind turbine]]s is the ratio between the tangential speed of the tip of a blade and the actual [[speed]] of the wind, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. The tip-speed ratio is related to efficiency, with the optimum varying with blade design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind Turbine Tip Speed Ratio {{!}} REUK.co.uk|url=http://www.reuk.co.uk/wordpress/wind/wind-turbine-tip-speed-ratio/|website=www.reuk.co.uk|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher tip speeds result in higher noise levels and require stronger blades due to large [[centrifugal force]]s.

:: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{\mbox{Tip speed of blade}}{\mbox{Wind speed}}&lt;/math&gt;

The tip speed of the blade can be calculated as &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; times R, where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the rotor rotational speed in radians/second, and R is the rotor radius in meters. Therefore, we can also write:

:: &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{\omega\text{R}}{v}&lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the wind speed specified in meters/second.

== Cp - λ curves ==
The power coefficient, &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is a quantity that expresses what fraction of the power in the wind is being extracted by the wind turbine. It is generally assumed to be a function of both tip-speed ratio and pitch angle. Below is a plot of the variation of the power coefficient with variations in the tip-speed ratio when the pitch is held constant:

[[File:Cplambdadiagram.jpg|500px|center]]

=== The case for variable speed wind turbines ===
Originally, wind turbines were fixed speed. This has the benefit that the rotor speed in the generator is constant, thus the frequency of the AC Voltage is fixed. This allows the wind turbine to be directly connected to a transmission system. However, from the figure above, we can see that the power coefficient is a function of the tip-speed ratio. By extension, the efficiency of the wind turbine is a function of the tip-speed ratio.

Ideally, one would like to have a turbine operating at the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; at all wind speeds. This means that as the wind speed changes, the rotor speed must change to such that &lt;math&gt;C_p = C_{p~max}&lt;/math&gt;. A wind turbine with a variable rotor speed is called a [[variable speed wind turbine]]. Whilst this does mean that the wind turbine operates at or close to &lt;math&gt;C_{p~max}&lt;/math&gt; for a range of wind speeds, the frequency of the AC voltage generator will not be constant. This can be seen in the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;
N = \frac{120f}{P}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the rotor angular speed, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the AC voltage generated in the stator windings, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the number of poles in the [[Alternator|generator]] inside the nacelle. That is, direct connection to a [[Electric power transmission|transmission system]] for a variable speed is not permissible. What is required is a power converter which converts the signal generated by the turbine generator into DC and then converts that signal to an AC signal with the grid/transmission system frequency.

=== The case against variable speed wind turbines ===
As already mentioned, variable speed wind turbines cannot be directly connected to a transmission system. One of the drawbacks of this is that the inertia of the transmission system is reduced as more variable speed wind turbines are put online. This can result in more significant drops in the transmission system's voltage frequency in the event of the loss of a generating unit. Furthermore, variable speed wind turbines require power electronics, which increases the complexity of the turbine and introduces new sources of failures. It has also been suggested that additional energy capture achieved by comparing a variable speed wind turbine to a fixed speed wind turbine is approximately 2%.&lt;ref&gt;Dependence of performance of variable speed wind
turbines on the turbulence, dynamics and control, Leithead&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''underweight''' person is a person whose [[body weight]] is considered too low to be healthy. Underweight people have a [[body mass index]] (BMI) of under 18.5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/risk.htm |publisher=National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a weight 15% to 20% below that normal for their age and [[Human height|height]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahan|first=L. Kathleen|title=Krause's Food, Nutrition &amp; Diet Therapy, 10th Ed.|year=2000|publisher=W.B. Saunders Co.|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A person may be underweight due to [[genetics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/body-shape-is-down-to-genes/695697/|title=Body Shape 'Is Down to Genes'|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070904122434.htm|title='Skinny Gene' Exists

Being underweight is associated with certain medical conditions, including [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.diabetes.co.uk/symptoms/unexplained-weight-loss.html|title=Unexplained Weight Loss - Reasons, Symptoms &amp; Causes|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hyperthyroidism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Milas|first=Kresimira|title=Hyperthyroidism Symptoms - Signs and symptoms caused by excessive amounts of thyroid hormones|url=http://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/hyperthyroidism/hyperthyroidism-symptoms|publisher=Endocrine Web|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signs and Symptoms of Cancer|url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerBasics/signs-and-symptoms-of-cancer|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hira|first=S. K.|author2=H. L. Dupont |author3=D. N. Lanjewar |author4=Y. N. Dholakia |title=Severe weight loss: the predominant clinical presentation of tuberculosis in patients with HIV infection in India.|journal=National Medical Journal of India|year=1998|volume=11|issue=6|pages=256–258|pmid=10083790}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with [[gastroenterology|gastrointestinal]] or [[liver]] problems may be unable to absorb nutrients adequately. People with certain eating disorders can also be underweight due to lack of nutrients/over exercise.

==Problems==

Underweight might be secondary to or symptomatic of an underlying disease.  Unexplained weight loss may require professional medical diagnosis.

Underweight can also be a primary causative condition.  Severely underweight individuals may have poor physical [[Endurance|stamina]] and a weak [[immune system]], leaving them open to [[infection]]. According to Robert E. Black of the [[Johns Hopkins School of Public Health]] (JHSPH), "Underweight status ... and micronutrient deficiencies also cause decreases in immune and non-immune host defenses, and should be classified as underlying causes of death if followed by infectious diseases that are the terminal associated causes."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Black |first1=Robert E. |last2=Morris |first2=Saul S. |last3= Bryce |first3= Jennifer |title=Where and Why are 10 Million Children Dying Every Year? |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=361 |pages=2226–34 |date=28 June 2003 |pmid=12842379 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13779-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
People who are malnutrative underweight raise special concerns, as not only gross caloric intake may be inadequate, but also intake and absorption of other vital nutrients, especially essential [[amino acid]]s and micro-nutrients such as [[vitamin]]s and minerals.

In women, being severely underweight as a result of an eating disorder, or due to excessive strenuous exercise can result in [[amenorrhea]] (absence of menstruation),&lt;ref&gt;http://contemporaryobgyn.modernmedicine.com/%5Bnode-source-domain-raw%5D/news/modernmedicine/modern-medicine-now/amenorrhea-caused-extremes-body-mas?page=full&lt;/ref&gt; [[infertility]] and, if gestational weight gain is too low, possible complications during [[pregnancy]].  

Malnourishment can also cause [[anemia]] and hair loss. &lt;!-- ref to eMedicine.com was simply to medical dictionary definition for Amenorrhea, deleted (main article should cover it) --&gt;

Being underweight is an established&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18221845 |year=2008 |author1=Gjesdal |first2=JI |first3=GE |first4=JG |first5=GS |title=Impact of lean mass and fat mass on bone mineral density: the Hordaland Health Study |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=191–200 |doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2007.11.002 |journal=Maturitas |last2=Halse |last3=Eide |last4=Brun |last5=Tell}}&lt;/ref&gt; risk factor for [[osteoporosis]], even for young people. This is seen in individuals suffering from the female athlete triad, when disordered eating or excessive exercise cause amenorrhea, hormone changes during an ovulation leads to loss of bone mineral density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8013041 |year=1994 |author1=Nattiv |first2=R |first3=B |first4=KK |title=The female athlete triad.

Although being underweight has been reported to increase mortality at rates comparable to that seen in morbidly obese people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=6585126 |year=1984 |author1=Waaler HT. |title=Height, weight and mortality. The Norwegian experience |issue=679 |pages=1–56 |doi=10.1111/j.0954-6820.1984.tb12901.x |journal=Acta Med Scand Suppl |volume=215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the effect is much less drastic when restricted to non-smokers with no history of disease,&lt;ref name="Body Weight and Mortality:What is the optimum weight for a longer life?"&gt;[http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/hliving/BMIwords.html Body Weight and Mortality:What is the optimum weight for a longer life?].&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that smoking and disease-related weight loss are the leading causes of the observed effect.

== Treatment ==

===Diet===
Underweight individuals may be advised to gain weight by increasing [[calorie (food)|calorie]] intake. This can be done by eating a sufficient volume of sufficiently calorie-dense foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/underweight/AN00597|title=Underweight? See how to add pounds healthfully|author=Zeratsky, Katherine|date=23 August 2011|work=Nutrition and healthy eating|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body weight may also be increased through the consumption of liquid nutritional supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/gain_healthy_parent.html|title=Healthy Weight Gain|publisher=Children's Hospital Boston, Center for Young Women's Health|accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[nutritional supplements]] may be recommended for individuals with insufficient vitamin or mineral intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nutrition.about.com/od/tryingtogainweight/a/gainehalthyweig.htm|title=Gain Weight and Be Healthy

===Exercise===
Another way for underweight people to gain weight is by exercising. [[Muscle hypertrophy]] increases body mass. Weight lifting exercises are effective in helping to improve muscle tone as well as helping with weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menshealth.com/cda/advicedetail.do?site=mensHealth&amp;channel=best.life&amp;conitem=3d084d5dfcf53010VgnVCM100000cfe793cd____&amp;expertId=1c74f5b65fa53010VgnVCM100000cfe793cd____|title=Men's Health|publisher=Men's Health|accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weight lifting has also been shown to improve bone mineral density,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gleeson|first=Peggy|author2=Elizabeth J. Protas |author3=Adrian D. Leblanc |author4=Victor S. Schneider |author5=Harlan J. Evans |title=Effects of weight lifting on bone mineral density in premenopausal women|journal=Journal of Bone and Mineral Research|date=February 1990|volume=5|issue=2|pages=153–158|doi=10.1002/jbmr.5650050208|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbmr.5650050208/abstract|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which underweight people have an increased risk of deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coin|first=A. |author2=G.

Exercise itself is [[Catabolism|catabolic]], which results in a brief reduction in mass. The gain in weight that can result of it comes from the [[anabolic]] overcompensation when the body recovers and overcompensates via muscle [[hypertrophy]]. This can happen by an increase in the muscle proteins, or through enhanced storage of [[glycogen]] in muscles. Exercise can help stimulate a person's appetite if they are not inclined to eat.

===Appetite stimulants===
{{main|Orexigenic}}
Certain drugs may increase appetite either as their primary effect or as a side effect. Antidepressants, such as [[mirtazapine]] or [[amitriptyline]], and antipsychotics, particularly [[chlorpromazine]]  and [[haloperidol]], as well as [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (found in [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]), all present an increase in appetite as a side effect. In states where it is approved, [[medicinal cannabis]] may be prescribed for severe appetite loss, such as that caused by [[cancer]], [[AIDS]], or severe levels of persistent [[anxiety]]. Other drugs or supplements which may increase appetite include [[antihistamine]]s (such as [[diphenhydramine]], [[promethazine]] or [[cyproheptadine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ppul.20265 | volume=40 | title=Long-term trial of cyproheptadine as an appetite stimulant in cystic fibrosis | year=2005 | journal=Pediatric Pulmonology | pages=251–256 | last1 = Homnick | first1 = Douglas N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[B vitamin]] supplements (such as [[vitamin B12]] and [[B vitamins|vitamin B-complex]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10098">[[File:Weather Station at Feilding Waste Water Treatment Plant.JPG|thumb|240px|An anemometer is commonly used to measure wind speed.]]

'''Wind speed''', or wind [[flow velocity]], is a fundamental [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] quantity caused by air moving from [[high-pressure area|high]] to [[low-pressure area|low pressure]], usually due to changes in temperature. Note that wind direction is usually almost parallel to [[isobar (meteorology)|isobars]] (and not perpendicular, as one might expect), due to [[Earth's rotation]].

Wind speed affects [[weather forecasting]], [[aviation]] and [[maritime transport|maritime]] operations, [[construction]] projects, growth and [[metabolism]] rate of many plant species, and countless other implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |year=2010 |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |entry=Abiotic factor |title=Encyclopedia of Earth |editors=Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland |publisher=[[National Council for Science and the Environment]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608071757/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |archive-date=2013-06-08 |location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wind]] speed is now commonly measured with an [[anemometer]], but can also be classified using the older [[Beaufort scale]], which is based on personal observation of specifically defined wind effects.

==Factors affecting wind speed==
Wind speed is affected by a number of factors and situations, operating on varying scales (from micro to macro scales). These include the pressure gradient, Rossby waves and [[jet stream]]s, and local weather conditions. There are also links to be found between wind speed and [[wind direction]], notably with the pressure gradient and terrain conditions.

'''Pressure gradient''' is a term to describe the difference in air pressure between two points in the atmosphere or on the surface of the Earth. It is vital to wind speed, because the greater the difference in pressure, the faster the wind flows (from the high to low pressure) to balance out the variation. The pressure gradient, when combined with the [[Coriolis effect]] and [[friction]], also influences [[wind direction]].

'''[[Rossby wave]]s''' are strong winds in the upper [[troposphere]]. These operate on a global scale and move from West to East (hence being known as [[Westerlies]]). The Rossby waves are themselves a different wind speed from what we experience in the lower [[troposphere]].

'''Local weather conditions''' play a key role in influencing wind speed, as the formation of [[hurricanes]], [[monsoon]]s and [[cyclones]] as freak weather conditions can drastically affect the flow velocity of the wind.

==Highest speed==
[[File:The Big Wind Anemometer.JPG|thumb|upright|The original anemometer that measured The Big Wind in 1934 at Mount Washington Observatory]]

The fastest wind speed not related to [[tornado]]es ever recorded was during the passage of Tropical [[Cyclone Olivia]] on 10 April 1996: an [[automatic weather station]] on [[Barrow Island (Western Australia)|Barrow Island]], [[Australia]], registered a maximum wind gust of 408&amp;nbsp;km/h (220&amp;nbsp;kn; 253&amp;nbsp;mph; 113&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/new-world-record-wind-gust|publisher=World Meteorological Association|title=World record wind gust|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wind gust was evaluated by the WMO Evaluation Panel who found that the anemometer was mechanically sound and the gust was within statistical probability and ratified the measurement in 2010. The anemometer was mounted 10 m above ground level (and thus 64 m above sea level). During the cyclone, several extreme gusts of greater than 300&amp;nbsp;km/h (160&amp;nbsp;kn; 83&amp;nbsp;m/s) were recorded, with a maximum 5-minute mean speed of 176&amp;nbsp;km/h (95&amp;nbsp;kn; 110&amp;nbsp;mph; 49&amp;nbsp;m/s), the extreme gust factor was in the order of 2.27–2.75 times the mean wind speed. The pattern and scales of the gusts suggest that a [[mesovortex]] was embedded in the already strong [[eyewall]] of the cyclone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/amoj/docs/2012/courtney_hres.pdf|title=Documentation and verification of the world extreme wind gust record: 113.3 m s–1 on Barrow Island, Australia, during passage of tropical cyclone Olivia|publisher=Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The now second highest surface wind speed ever officially recorded is 372&amp;nbsp;km/h (231&amp;nbsp;mph; 103&amp;nbsp;m/s) at the [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)]] Observatory: 6,288&amp;nbsp;ft (1917&amp;nbsp;m) above sea level in the US on 12 April 1934, using a heated anemometer. The anemometer, specifically designed for use on Mount Washington was later tested by the US [[National Weather Service|National Weather Bureau]] and confirmed to be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountwashington.org/about/visitor/recordwind.php|accessdate=26 January 2010|title=The story of the world record wind|publisher=Mount Washington Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind speeds within certain atmospheric phenomena (such as [[tornado]]es) may greatly exceed these values but have never been accurately measured. Directly measuring these tornadic winds is rarely done as the violent wind would destroy the instruments. A method of estimating speed is to use [[Doppler on Wheels]] to sense the wind speeds remotely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Massive Okla. tornado had windspeed up to 200 mph|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/massive-okla-tornado-had-windspeed-up-to-200-mph/|accessdate=17 May 2014|newspaper=CBS News|date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, using this method, the figure of 486&amp;nbsp;km/h (302&amp;nbsp;mph; 135&amp;nbsp;m/s) during the [[1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado]] in [[Oklahoma]] on 3 May 1999 is often quoted as the highest-recorded surface wind speed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#History|title=Historical Tornadoes|publisher=National Weather Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; although another figure of {{Convert|512|km/h|mph}} has also been quoted for the same tornado.&lt;ref name=worldrecordacademy&gt;{{cite news|title=Highest surface wind speed-Tropical Cyclone Olivia sets world record|url=http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/weather/highest_surface_wind_speed_Tropical_Cyclone_Olivia_sets_world_record_101519.htm|accessdate=17 May 2014|newspaper=World Record Academy|date=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another number used by the Center for Severe Weather Research for that measurement is {{convert|486|+/-|32|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wurman|first=Joshua|authorlink=Joshua Wurman|title=Doppler On Wheels|publisher=Center for Severe Weather Research|year=2007|url=http://www.cswr.org/dow/DOW.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sZWvfQp8?url=http://www.cswr.org/dow/DOW.htm|archivedate=2010-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, speeds measured by Doppler radar are not considered official records.&lt;ref name=worldrecordacademy/&gt;

== Measurement ==
{{see also|Anemometer}}
[[File:Anemometer-Animation.gif|thumb|Modern day anemometer used to capture wind speed.]]

An anemometer is one of the tools used to measure wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciese.org/curriculum/weatherproj2/en/docs/anemometer.shtml|title=Make and Use an Anemometer to measure Wind Speed|last=Koen|first=Joshua|website=www.ciese.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A device consisting of a vertical pillar and three or four concave cups, the anemometer captures the horizontal movement of air particles (wind speed). 

Another tool used to measure wind velocity includes a GPS combined with pitot tube. A fluid flow velocity tool, the [[Pitot tube]] is primarily used to determine the air velocity of an aircraft.

==Design of structures==
{{main|Wind engineering}}
[[File:Anemometer_on_stage_set.JPG|thumb|right|Anemometer on an outdoor stage set, to measure wind speed]]

Wind speed is a common factor in the design of structures and buildings around the world. It is often the governing factor in the required lateral strength of a structure's design.

In the United States, the wind speed used in design is often referred to as a "3-second gust" which is the highest sustained gust over a 3-second period having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50 (ASCE 7-05).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreascience.or.kr/journal/AboutJournal.jsp?kojic=KJKHCF|title=Wind and Structures |website=Korea Science|language=ko|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design wind speed is accepted by most building codes in the United States and often governs the lateral design of buildings and structures.

In Canada, reference wind pressures are used in design and are based on the "mean hourly" wind speed having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50. The reference wind pressure (q) is calculated in Pascals using the following equation: q=(1/2)pV² where p is the air density in kg/m³ and V is wind speed in m/s.&lt;ref&gt;NBC 2005 Structural Commentaries - Part 4 of Div. B, Comm. I&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, wind speeds have been reported with a variety of averaging times (such as fastest mile, 3-second gust, 1-minute and mean hourly) which designers may have to take into account. To convert wind speeds from one averaging time to another, the Durst Curve was developed which defines the relation between probable maximum wind speed averaged over t seconds, V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, and mean wind speed over one hour V&lt;sub&gt;3600&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;ASCE 7-05 commentary Figure C6-4, ASCE 7-10 C26.5-1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Windflow Technology''' is a company based in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand known for its unique [[wind turbine]] gearbox design.

It was listed on the [[New Zealand Stock Exchange]] on 2 December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nzx.com/markets/NZSX/WTL| title=Windflow Technology Limited Ordinary Shares (WTL)| publisher=New Zealand Stock Exchange| accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, [[Mercury Energy|Mighty River Power]] purchased a 19.95% share of Windflow Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nzx.com/markets/NZAX/WTL/announcements/4729464| title=Mighty River Power Buys Into Windflow Technology| publisher=Market announcement, Windflow Technology| date=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

The operation of a Windflow Technology turbine installed at Gebbies Pass near Christchurch encountered opposition from local residents who raised concerns about noise. The neighbouring valley was very sheltered, and therefore had very little background sound. Because of this, Windflow offered to comply with low sound levels of 30 dBA, 10 dBA lower than the District Council's usual requirement of 40 dBA. However, sound levels were at 35 dBA, so Windflow modified the gearbox, which reduced the turbine's sound. Sound levels were again measured and this time be within the requirement of its [[resource consent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Windflow Technology set up New Zealand Windfarms to own and run the [[Te Rere Hau Wind Farm]] near [[Palmerston North]]. Initially, this was wholly owned but now has been completely sold off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windflow.co.nz/pdf-folder/Financial-Reporting/Half%20year%20Dec%202010.pdf Windflow Interim Report to 31 December 2010], Market Announcement, Windflow Technology, 11 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The company achieved ISO 9001:2000 certification for the design and production of its Windflow 500 wind turbine in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windflow.co.nz/news/media-releases/2008/windflow-technology-gains-iso/ Windflow Technology Gains ISO], press release, Windflow Technology, 27 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, the Windflow 500 gained Class 1A of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) design standard IEC 61400-1 (edition 3) through [[Lloyd's Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In March 2012, the company signed a licensing agreement with a subsidiary of large US company General Dynamics (GD Satcom)who will manufacture and sell the Windflow designed 500&amp;nbsp;kW turbines to customers in North and South America, Africa and U.S. territories and military bases worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.windflow.co.nz/news/media-releases/2012/windflow-technology-and-general-dynamics-satcom-technologies-sign-licensing-agreement-for-development-and-marketing-of-turbine-technologies&lt;/ref&gt;  GD Energy Solutions is promoting the original Class 1 500&amp;nbsp;kW turbine as the GD33-500 and a newly developed Class 2 500&amp;nbsp;kW turbine as the GD45-500.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gdenergysolutions.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Windflow Technology installed a 500&amp;nbsp;kW turbine on the windy island of Orkney, its first exported turbine which is expected to generate over GBP350,000 per year (through the UK Feed-In Tariff which is 17.5 p/kWh for 500&amp;nbsp;kW turbines).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.windflow.co.uk/links-and-news/windflow-turbine-generates-revenue-in-scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

Windflow UK has wrapped up installation of its 100th 500&amp;nbsp;kW wind turbine.  The twin-bladed machine, which was designed and manufactured in New Zealand by parent company Windflow Technology Ltd, was erected at New Holland Farm on the Orkney mainland in Scotland. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://renews.biz/77742/windflow-notches-a-century&lt;/ref&gt;

For four years, the North Harris Trust has been working with Windflow Technology Ltd, who manufacture a unique two-bladed machine that can deal with the turbulent wind conditions found amongst the North Harris hills. The first of three machines arrived from New Zealand in late 2014 and was lifted into place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.north-harris.org/2014/12/a-long-trip-from-new-zealand-ends-in-the-harris-hills/&lt;/ref&gt;

1 May 2015, Windflow Technology Ltd announced the installation and first operation of the prototype 45-500 wind turbine at a site in Mitchell County, Texas USA. The turbine was installed to supply power for the Mitchell County Desalination Plant, which will supplement water supplies to areas in the County not covered by municipal water utilities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nzx.com/companies/WTL/announcements/2637&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost of ownership==
Life cycle cost analysis by ZEV customers indicate that it costs approximately 60% less to drive a ZEV than to drive a gasoline fueled scooter of equal performance and cost to the ZEV electric if the bike is driven to the point of battery replacement. These customers report full costs not including depreciation of 12 cents/mile.{{Better source|date=January 2014}}&lt;ref name=mmdpressrelease&gt;{{citation|title=ZEV Delivers the ZEV10 LRC (225 km/140 m range) Fast Electric Motor Scooter|work=Press release|date=April 8, 2013|publisher=Z Electric Vehicle Corp.|url=http://www.mmdnewswire.com/zev-fast-electric-motor-scooter-129736.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel costs on test bikes show fuel costs run about $.0127/mile or about $127 per 10,000 miles in the Ohio/WV/Pa area of the USA.
