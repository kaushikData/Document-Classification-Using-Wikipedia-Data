It is a bacterial process occurring in the presence of oxygen. Bacteria rapidly consume organic matter and convert it into [[carbon dioxide]], water and a range of lower molecular weight organic compounds. As there is no new supply of organic material from sewage, the [[activated sludge]] biota begin to die and are used as food by [[saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]] bacteria. This stage of the process is known as ''endogenous respiration'' and it is process that reduces the solid concentration in the sludge.

==Process==
Aerobic digestion is typically used in an activated sludge treatment plant. Waste activated sludge and primary sludge are combined, where appropriate, and passed to a thickener where the solids content is increased. This substantially reduces the volume that is required to be treated in the digester.The process is usually run as a batch process with more than one digester tank in operation at any one time.&lt;ref name="creek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fultoncountyga.gov/solids-treatment/aerobic-digestion-of-sludge|title=Aerobic digestion of sludge|publisher=Johns Creek Environmental Campus|access-date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Air is pumped through the tank and the contents are stirred to keep the contents fully mixed. Carbon dioxide, waste air and small quantities of other gases including [[hydrogen sulfide]] are given off. These waste gases require treatment to reduce odours in works close to housing or capable of generating public nuisance.&lt;ref name="creek"/&gt; The digestion is continued until the percentage of degradable solids is reduced to between 20% and 10% depending on local conditions&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; 
Where non sewage waste is being processed, organic waste such as food, cardboard and horticultural waste can be significantly reduced in volume leaving an output that can be used as soil improver or biomass fuel.

==Advantages==
Because the aerobic digestion occurs much faster than [[anaerobic digestion]], the capital costs of aerobic digestion are lower.

The process is usually run at ambient temperature and the process is much less complex than anaerobic digestion and is easier to manage.

==Disadvantages==
The operating costs are typically much greater for aerobic digestion than for anaerobic digestion because of energy used by the blowers, pumps and motors needed to add oxygen to the process. However, recent technological advances include non-electrically aerated filter systems that use natural air currents for the aeration instead of electrically operated machinery.

The digested sludge is relatively low in residual energy and although it can be dried and incinerated to produce heat, the energy yield is very much lower than that produced by anaerobic digestion

==ATADs==
Autothermal Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion (ATAD) is a [[Sewage sludge treatment|faecal sludge treatment]] design concept that uses the nutrients in the sludge and the metabolic heat of the bacteria to create high temperatures in the aerobic digester. This gradually shifts the microbial community towards [[Thermophile|termophilic]] at temperatures typically at 55 degree Celsius or above. While the higher aeration requirements of ATADs further increase energy use and potential smell nuisance, the increased temperature makes the resulting [[biosolids]] much safer for re-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Layden|first1=Noreen M.|title=Autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD) — Part I: Review of origins, design, and process operation|journal=Journal of Environmental Engineering and Science|date=November 2007|volume= 6|issue= 6|doi=10.1139/S07-015|url=http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/10.1139/S07-015|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agile architecture''' means how enterprise / system / [[Software architect|software architects]] apply architectural practice in [[agile software development]]. A number of commentators have identified a tension between traditional software architecture and agile methods along the axis of adaptation (leaving architectural decisions until the last possible moment) versus anticipation (planning in advance). (Kruchten, 2010 )&lt;ref&gt;Kruchten, P. (2010). Software Architecture and Agile Software
Development — A Clash of Two Cultures? Proceedings of the 32nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterman, Nobel and Allan (2015) &lt;ref&gt;Waterman, Nobel and Allan. (2015). How Much Up-Front? A Grounded Theory of Agile Architecture. In Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt; explored the tensions between spending too little time designing an up-front architecture, increasing risk, and spending too much time, negatively impacting of the delivery of value to the customer. They identify six forces that can affect agile architecture: Requirements instability, technical risk, early value, team culture, customer agility and experience. These forces may be addressed by six strategies: Respond to change, address risk, emergent architecture, big design up front and use [[Enterprise architecture framework|framework]]s and template architectures.

Several attempts have been made to specify what makes up an agile approach to architecture. According to the [[Scaled Agile Framework|SAFe]] framework, the principles of agile [[architecture]] are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scalingsoftwareagility.wordpress.com/2008/07/10/agile-architecture-%e2%80%93-the-whitepaper-now-on-line/|title=Agile Architecture – The Whitepaper Now On Line|last=Leffingwell|first=Dean|date=2008-07-10|website=Scaling Software Agility|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Design emerges. [[Architecture]] is a collaboration. (intentional architecture)
# The bigger the system, the longer the runway (architectural runway)
# Build the simplest architecture that can possibly work (established design principles)
# When in doubt, code or model it out (spikes, prototype, domain and use case models)
# They build it, they test it (design for testability)
# There is no monopoly on innovation (teams, hackathons) - Facebook's Like button was conceived as part of a hackathon
# Implement architectural flow (architectural epics and the portfolio kanban) - the portfolio Kanban goes through [[funnel]], review, analysis, portfolio backlog and implementing

* Evolutionary collaboration over [[blueprint|blueprinting]]
* Communication over perfection
* Active stakeholder participation
* Enterprise architects are active participants on development teams
* Enablement over inspection (exemplars)
* High level models (the more complex, the more abstract)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="115578">'''Ancestral reconstruction''' (also known as '''''Character Mapping''''' or '''''Character Optimization''''') is the extrapolation back in time from measured characteristics of individuals (or populations) to their [[Common descent|common ancestors]].  It is an important application of [[phylogenetics]], the reconstruction and study of the [[evolution]]ary relationships among individuals, populations or [[species]] to their ancestors. In the context of [[evolutionary biology]], ancestral reconstruction can be used to recover different kinds of ancestral character states of organisms that lived millions of years ago.&lt;ref name=Omland1999 /&gt; These states include the [[Nucleic acid sequence|genetic sequence]] ([[ancestral sequence reconstruction]]), the [[Peptide sequence|amino acid sequence]] of a [[protein]], the composition of a [[genome]] (e.g., gene order), a measurable characteristic of an organism ([[phenotype]]), and the [[species distribution|geographic range]] of an ancestral population or species (ancestral range reconstruction). This is desirable because it allows us to examine parts of [[phylogenetic tree]]s corresponding to the distant past, clarifying the evolutionary history of the species in the tree. Since modern [[genetic sequence]]s are essentially a variation of ancient ones, access to ancient sequences may identify other variations and organisms which could have arisen from those sequences.&lt;ref name=CaiPei2004 /&gt; In addition to genetic sequences, one might attempt to track the changing of one character trait to another, such as fins turning to legs.

Non-biological applications include the reconstruction of the vocabulary or phonemes of [[ancient language]]s,&lt;ref name=PlatnickCameron1977 /&gt; and cultural characteristics of ancient societies such as oral traditions&lt;ref name=BentleyTehrani2013 /&gt; or marriage practices.&lt;ref name=MichalakWalker2011 /&gt;

Ancestral reconstruction relies on a sufficiently realistic [[statistical model|statistical]] [[Substitution model|model of evolution]] to accurately recover ancestral states. These models use the genetic information already obtained through methods such as [[phylogenetics]] to determine the route that [[evolution]] has taken and when evolutionary events occurred.&lt;ref name=Brooks1999 /&gt; No matter how well the model approximates the actual evolutionary history, however, one's ability to accurately reconstruct an ancestor deteriorates with increasing evolutionary time between that ancestor and its observed descendants. Additionally, more realistic models of evolution are inevitably more complex and difficult to calculate.  Progress in the field of ancestral reconstruction has relied heavily on the [[Moore's law|exponential growth of computing power]] and the concomitant development of efficient [[Algorithm|computational algorithms]] (e.g., a [[dynamic programming]] algorithm for the joint [[maximum likelihood]] reconstruction of ancestral sequences.&lt;ref name=PupkoPe2000 /&gt;) Methods of ancestral reconstruction are often applied to a given [[Phylogeny|phylogenetic tree]] that has already been inferred from the same data.  While convenient, this approach has the disadvantage that its results are contingent on the accuracy of a single phylogenetic tree.  In contrast, some researchers &lt;ref name=PagelMeade2004 /&gt; advocate a more computationally intensive [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] approach that accounts for uncertainty in tree reconstruction by evaluating ancestral reconstructions over many trees.

==History==

The concept of ancestral reconstruction is often credited to [[Emile Zuckerkandl]] and [[Linus Pauling]].  Motivated by the development of techniques for determining the [[Peptide sequence|primary (amino acid) sequence]] of proteins by [[Frederick Sanger]] in 1955,&lt;ref name=SangerThompson1955 /&gt; Zuckerkandl and Pauling postulated&lt;ref name=PaulingZuckerkandl1963 /&gt; that such sequences could be used to infer not only the [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] relating the observed protein sequences, but also the ancestral protein sequence at the earliest point (root) of this tree.  However, the idea of reconstructing ancestors from measurable biological characteristics had already been developing in the field of [[cladistics]], one of the precursors of modern phylogenetics.  Cladistic methods, which appeared as early as 1901, infer the evolutionary relationships of species on the basis of the distribution of shared characteristics, of which some are inferred to be descended from common ancestors. Furthermore, [[Theodoseus Dobzhansky]] and [[Alfred Sturtevant]] articulated the principles of ancestral reconstruction in a phylogenetic context in 1938, when inferring the evolutionary history of [[chromosomal inversion]]s in ''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]''.&lt;ref name=DobzhanskySturtevant1937 /&gt;

Thus, ancestral reconstruction has its roots in several disciplines. Today, computational methods for ancestral reconstruction continue to be extended and applied in a diversity of settings, so that ancestral states are being inferred not only for biological characteristics and the molecular sequences, but also for the structure &lt;ref name=HarmsThornton2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WilliamsPollock2006 /&gt; or [[Catalyst|catalytic]] properties &lt;ref name=Ronquist2004 /&gt; of ancient versus modern [[protein]]s, the geographic location of populations and species ([[phylogeography]])&lt;ref name=ReeSmith2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=FraserLemey2009 /&gt; and the higher-order structure of genomes.&lt;ref name=WattersonEwens1982 /&gt; One of the most prominent examples is tracing the evolution that took place from ape to man {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

==Methods and algorithms==

Any attempt at ancestral reconstruction begins with a [[phylogeny]].  In general, a phylogeny is a tree-based [[hypothesis]] about the order in which populations (referred to as [[Taxon|taxa]]) are related by descent from common ancestors.  Observed taxa are represented by the ''tips'' or ''terminal nodes'' of the tree that are progressively connected by branches to their common ancestors, which are represented by the branching points of the tree that are usually referred to as the ''ancestral'' or ''internal nodes''.  Eventually, all lineages converge to the [[most recent common ancestor]] of the entire sample of taxa.  In the context of ancestral reconstruction, a phylogeny is often treated as though it were a known quantity (with Bayesian approaches being an important exception).  Because there can be an enormous number of phylogenies that are nearly equally effective at explaining the data, reducing the subset of phylogenies supported by the data to a single representative, or point estimate, can be a convenient and sometimes necessary simplifying assumption.

Ancestral reconstruction can be thought of as the direct result of applying a hypothetical model of evolution to a given phylogeny.  When the model contains one or more free parameters, the overall objective is to estimate these parameters on the basis of measured characteristics among the observed taxa (sequences) that descended from common ancestors.  [[Occam's razor|Parsimony]] is an important exception to this paradigm: though it has been shown that there are circumstances under which it is the maximum likelihood estimator,&lt;ref name=TuffleySteel1997 /&gt; at its core, it is simply based on the heuristic that changes in character state are rare, without attempting to quantify that rarity.

There are three different classes of method for ancestral reconstruction. In chronological order of discovery, these are [[maximum parsimony]], [[maximum likelihood]], and [[Bayesian Inference]]. Maximum parsimony considers all evolutionary events equally likely; maximum likelihood accounts for the differing likelihood of certain classes of event; and Bayeisan inference relates the conditional probability of an event to the likelihood of the tree, as well as the amount of uncertainty that is associated with that tree. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood yield a single most probable outcome, whereas Bayesian inference accounts for uncertainties in the data and yields a sample of possible trees.

===Maximum parsimony===
{{main|Maximum Parsimony}}

Parsimony, known colloquially as "[[Occam's razor]]", refers to the principle of selecting the simplest of competing hypotheses.  In the context of ancestral reconstruction, parsimony endeavours to find the distribution of ancestral states within a given tree which minimizes the total number of character state changes that would be necessary to explain the states observed at the tips of the tree.  This method of [[maximum parsimony]]&lt;ref name=SwoffordMaddison1987 /&gt; is one of the earliest formalized algorithms for reconstructing ancestral states, as well as one of the simplest.&lt;ref name=WilliamsPollock2006 /&gt;

Maximum parsimony can be implemented by one of several algorithms.  One of the earliest examples is [[Walter M. Fitch|Fitch's method]],&lt;ref name=Fitch1971 /&gt; which assigns ancestral character states by parsimony via two traversals of a rooted [[binary tree]]. The first stage is a [[Tree traversal#Post-order 2|post-order traversal]] that proceeds from the tips toward the root of a tree by visiting descendant (child) nodes before their parents.  Initially, we are determining the set of possible character states ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the ''i''-th ancestor based on the observed character states of its descendants.  Each assignment is the [[Intersection (set theory)|set intersection]] of the character states of the ancestor's descendants; if the intersection is the empty set, then it is the [[Union (set theory)|set union]].  In the latter case, it is implied that a character state change has occurred between the ancestor and one of its two immediate descendants. Each such event counts towards the algorithm's cost function, which may be used to discriminate among alternative trees on the basis of maximum parsimony.  Next, a [[Tree traversal#Pre-order 2|pre-order traversal]] of the tree is performed, proceeding from the root towards the tips. Character states are then assigned to each descendant based on which character states it shares with its parent. Since the root has no parent node, one may be required to select a character state arbitrarily, specifically when more than one possible state has been reconstructed at the root.

For example, consider a phylogeny recovered for a genus of plants containing 6 species A - F (Figure 1), where each plant is pollinated by either a "bee", "hummingbird" or "wind". One obvious question is what the pollinators at deeper nodes were in the phylogeny of this genus of plants. Under maximum parsimony, an ancestral state reconstruction for this clade reveals that "hummingbird" is the most parsimonious ancestral state for the lower clade (plants D, E, F), that the ancestral states for the nodes in the top clade (plants A, B, C) are equivocal and that both "hummingbird" or "bee" pollinators are equally plausible for the pollination state at the root of the phylogeny. Supposing we have strong evidence from the fossil record that the root state is "hummingbird". Resolution of the root to "hummingbird" would yield the pattern of ancestral state reconstruction depicted by the symbols at the nodes (Figure 1) with the state requiring the fewest number of changes circled.

[[File:Parsimony.Anc.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 1. Phylogeny of a hypothetical genus of plants with pollination states of either "bees", "hummingbirds" or "wind" denoted by pictures at the tips. Pollination state nodes in the phylogenetic tree inferred under maximum parsimony are coloured on the branches leading into them (yellow represents "bee" pollination, red representing "hummingbird" pollination, and black representing "wind" pollination, dual coloured branches are equally parsimonious for the two states coloured). Assignment of "hummingbird" as the root state (because of prior knowledge from the fossil record) leads to the pattern of ancestral states represented by symbols at the nodes of the phylogeny, the state requiring the fewest number of changes to give rise to the pattern observed at the tips is circled at each node.]]

Parsimony methods are intuitively appealing and highly efficient, such that they are still used in some cases to seed maximum likelihood optimization algorithms with an initial phylogeny.&lt;ref name=Stamatakis2006 /&gt; However, the underlying assumption that evolution attained a certain end result as fast as possible is inaccurate. Natural selection and evolution do not work towards a goal, they simply select for or against randomly occurring genetic changes. Parsimony methods impose six general assumptions: that the phylogenetic tree you are using is correct, that you have all of the relevant data, in which no mistakes were made in coding, that all branches of the phylogenetic tree are equally likely to change, that the rate of evolution is slow, and that the chance of losing or gaining a characteristic is the same.&lt;ref name=Omland1999 /&gt; In reality, assumptions are often violated, leading to several issues:

# ''Variation in rates of evolution.''  Fitch's method assumes that changes between all character states are equally likely to occur; thus, any change incurs the same cost for a given tree.  This assumption is often unrealistic and can limit the accuracy of such methods.&lt;ref name=PagelMeade2004 /&gt; For example, [[Transition (genetics)|transitions]] tend to occur more often than [[transversion]]s in the evolution of nucleic acids. This assumption can be relaxed by assigning differential costs to specific character state changes, resulting in a weighted parsimony algorithm.&lt;ref name=Sankoff1975 /&gt;
# ''Rapid evolution.'' The upshot of the "minimum evolution" heuristic underlying such methods is that such methods assume that changes are ''rare'', and thus are inappropriate in cases where change is the norm rather than the exception.&lt;ref name=SchluterPrice1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Felsenstein1973 /&gt;  
# ''Variation in time among lineages.''  Parsimony methods implicitly assume that the same amount of evolutionary time has passed along every branch of the tree. Thus, they do not account for variation in branch lengths in the tree, which are often used to quantify the passage of evolutionary or chronological time.  This limitation makes the technique liable to infer that one change occurred on a very short branch rather than multiple changes occurring on a very long branch, for example.&lt;ref name=CunninghamOmland1998 /&gt;  In addition, it is possible that some branches of the tree could be experiencing higher selection and change rates than others, perhaps due to changing environmental factors. Some periods of time may represent more rapid evolution than others, when this happens parsimony becomes inaccurate.&lt;ref name=Schluter1999 /&gt; This shortcoming is addressed by model-based methods (both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods) that infer the stochastic process of evolution as it unfolds along each branch of a tree.&lt;ref name=LiSteel2008 /&gt;
# ''Statistical justification.''  Without a statistical model underlying the method, its estimates do not have well-defined uncertainties.&lt;ref name=SchluterPrice1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CunninghamOmland1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Felsenstein1985 /&gt;
# ''Convergent evolution.'' When considering a single character state, parsimony will automatically assume that two organisms that share that characteristic will be more closely related than those who don’t. For example, just because dogs and apes have fur does not mean that they are more closely related than apes are to humans.

===Maximum likelihood===

[[Maximum likelihood]] (ML) methods of ancestral state reconstruction treat the character states at internal nodes of the tree as parameters, and attempt to find the parameter values that maximize the probability of the data (the observed character states) given the hypothesis (a model of evolution and a phylogeny relating the observed sequences or taxa). In other words, this method assumes that the ancestral states are those which are statistically most likely, given the observed phenotypes. Some of the earliest ML approaches to ancestral reconstruction were developed in the context of [[molecular evolution|genetic sequence evolution]];&lt;ref name=YangKumarNei1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=KoshiGoldstein1996 /&gt; similar models were also developed for the analogous case of discrete character evolution.&lt;ref name=Pagel1999 /&gt;

The use of a model of evolution accounts for the fact that not all events are equally likely to happen. For example, a [[transition (genetics)|transition]], which is a type of point mutation from one purine to another, or from one pyrimidine to another is much more likely to happen than a [[transversion]], which is the chance of a purine being switched to a pyrimidine, or vice versa. These differences are not captured by maximum parsimony. However, just because some events are more likely than others does not mean that they always happen.  We know that throughout evolutionary history there have been times when there was a large gap between what was most likely to happen, and what actually occurred. When this is the case, maximum parsimony may actually be more accurate because it is more willing to make large, unlikely leaps than maximum likelihood is. Maximum likelihood has been shown to be quite reliable in reconstructing character states, but it does not do as good of a job at giving accurate estimations of the stability of proteins. Maximum likelihood always overestimates the stability of proteins, which makes sense since it assumes that the proteins that were made and used were the most stable and optimal.&lt;ref name=WilliamsPollock2006 /&gt; The merits of maximum likelihood have been subject to debate, with some having concluded that maximum likelihood test represents a good medium between accuracy and speed.&lt;ref name=GuindonGascuel2003 /&gt; However, other studies have complained that maximum likelihood takes too much time and computational power to be useful in some scenarios.&lt;ref name=DoornikOoms2003 /&gt;

These approaches employ the same probabilistic framework as used to infer the phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name=Felsenstein1981 /&gt; In brief, the evolution of a genetic sequence is modelled by a time-reversible continuous time [[Models of DNA evolution#DNA evolution as a continuous-time Markov chain|Markov process]]. In the simplest of these, all characters undergo independent state transitions (such as nucleotide substitutions) at a constant rate over time. This basic model is frequently extended to allow different rates on each branch of the tree. In reality, mutation rates may also vary over time (due, for example, to environmental changes); this can be modelled by allowing the rate parameters to evolve along the tree, at the expense of having an increased number of parameters. A model defines transition probabilities from states ''i'' to ''j'' along a branch of length ''t'' (in units of evolutionary time). The likelihood of a phylogeny is computed from a nested sum of transition probabilities that corresponds to the hierarchical structure of the proposed tree.  At each node, the likelihood of its descendants is summed over all possible ancestral character states at that node:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
L_x = \sum_{S_x\in \Omega}  P(S_x) \left(\sum_{S_y\in \Omega} P(S_y | S_x, t_{xy}) L_y \sum_{S_z\in \Omega} P(S_z | S_x, t_{xz}) L_z\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where we are computing the likelihood of the [[Tree (data structure)#Terminology|subtree]] rooted at node ''x'' with direct descendants ''y'' and ''z'', &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the character state of the ''i''-th node, &lt;math&gt;t_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the branch length (evolutionary time) between nodes ''i'' and ''j'', and &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all possible character states (for example, the nucleotides A, C, G, and T).&lt;ref name=Felsenstein1981 /&gt; Thus, the objective of ancestral reconstruction is to find the assignment to &lt;math&gt;S_x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' internal nodes that maximizes the likelihood of the observed data for a given tree.

==== Marginal and joint likelihood ====

Rather than compute the overall likelihood for alternative trees, the problem for ancestral reconstruction is to find the combination of character states at each ancestral node with the highest marginal maximum likelihood.  Generally speaking, there are two approaches to this problem.  First, one can assign the most likely character state to each ancestor independently of the reconstruction of all other ancestral states.  This approach is referred to as ''marginal reconstruction''.  It is akin to summing over all combinations of ancestral states at all of the other nodes of the tree (including the root node), other than those for which data is available. Second, one may instead attempt to find the joint combination of ancestral character states throughout the tree which jointly maximizes the likelihood of the data.  Thus, this approach is referred to as joint reconstruction.&lt;ref name=YangKumarNei1995 /&gt;  Not surprisingly, joint reconstruction is more [[Computational complexity theory|computationally complex]] than marginal reconstruction. Nevertheless, efficient algorithms for joint reconstruction have been developed with a time complexity that is generally linear with the number of observed taxa or sequences.&lt;ref name=PupkoPe2000/&gt;

ML-based methods of ancestral reconstruction tend to provide greater accuracy than MP methods in the presence of variation in rates of evolution among characters (or across sites in a genome).&lt;ref name=EyreWalker1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PupkoPeer2002 /&gt;  However, these methods are not yet able to accommodate variation in rates of evolution over time, otherwise known as [[heterotachy]].  If the rate of evolution for a specific character accelerates on a branch of the phylogeny, then the amount of evolution that has occurred on that branch will be underestimated for a given length of the branch and assuming a constant rate of evolution for that character. In addition to that, it is difficult to distinguish heterotachy from variation among characters in rates of evolution.&lt;ref name=GruenheitLockhart2008 /&gt;

Since ML (unlike maximum parsimony) requires the investigator to specify a model of evolution, its accuracy may be affected by the use of a grossly incorrect model (model misspecification).  Furthermore, ML can only provide a single reconstruction of character states (what is often referred to as a "point estimate") &amp;mdash; when the likelihood surface is highly non-convex, comprising multiple peaks (local optima), then a single point estimate cannot provide an adequate representation, and a Bayesian approach may be more suitable.

===Bayesian inference===

[[Bayesian inference]] uses the likelihood of observed data to update the investigator's belief, or [[Prior probability|prior distribution]], to yield the [[Posterior probability|posterior distribution]]. In the context of ancestral reconstruction, the objective is to infer the posterior probabilities of ancestral character states at each internal node of a given tree. Moreover, one can integrate these probabilities over the posterior distributions over the parameters of the evolutionary model and the space of all possible trees. This can be expressed as an application of [[Bayes' theorem]]:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P(S | D, \theta) &amp;= \frac{ P(D|S,\theta) P(S|\theta) }{ P(D|\theta) }\\
 &amp; \propto P(D|S,\theta) P(S|\theta) P(\theta)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where ''S'' represents the ancestral states, ''D'' corresponds to the observed data, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; represents both the evolutionary model and the phylogenetic tree.  &lt;math&gt;P(D|S,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the likelihood of the observed data which can be computed by [[Felsenstein's tree-pruning algorithm|Felsenstein's pruning algorithm]] as given above.  &lt;math&gt;P(S|\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the prior probability of the ancestral states for a given model and tree. Finally, &lt;math&gt;P(D|\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of the data for a given model and tree, integrated over all possible ancestral states.

Bayesian inference is the method that many have argued is the most accurate.&lt;ref name=PagelMeade2004 /&gt; In general, Bayesian statistical methods allow investigators to combine pre-existing information with new hypothesis. In the case of evolution, it combines the likelihood of the data observed with the likelihood that the events happened in the order they did, while recognizing the potential for error and uncertainty. Overall, it is the most accurate method for reconstructing ancestral genetic sequences, as well as protein stability.&lt;ref name=CunninghamOmland1998 /&gt; Unlike the other two methods, Bayesian inference yields a distribution of possible trees, allowing for more accurate and easily interpretable estimates of the variance of possible outcomes.&lt;ref name=HuelsenbeckRonquist2001 /&gt;

We have given two formulations above to emphasize the two different applications of Bayes' theorem, which we discuss in the following section.

==== Empirical and hierarchical Bayes ====

One of the first implementations of a Bayesian approach to ancestral sequence reconstruction was developed by Yang and colleagues,&lt;ref name=YangKumarNei1995 /&gt; where the maximum likelihood estimates of the evolutionary model and tree, respectively, were used to define the prior distributions. Thus, their approach is an example of an [[empirical Bayes method]] to compute the posterior probabilities of ancestral character states; this method was first implemented in the software package PAML.&lt;ref name=Yang1997 /&gt; In terms of the above Bayesian rule formulation, the empirical Bayes method fixes &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; to the empirical estimates of the model and tree obtained from the data, effectively dropping &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; from the posterior likelihood, and prior terms of the formula.  Moreover, Yang and colleagues&lt;ref name=YangKumarNei1995 /&gt; used the empirical distribution of site patterns (i.e., assignments of nucleotides to tips of the tree) in their alignment of observed nucleotide sequences in the denominator in place of exhaustively computing &lt;math&gt;P(D)&lt;/math&gt; over all possible values of ''S'' given &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.  Computationally, the empirical Bayes method is akin to the maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral states except that, rather than searching for the ML assignment of states based on their respective probability distributions at each internal node, the probability distributions themselves are reported directly.

[[Empirical Bayes method]]s for ancestral reconstruction require the investigator to assume that the evolutionary model parameters and tree are known without error.  When the size or complexity of the data makes this an unrealistic assumption, it may be more prudent to adopt the fully hierarchical Bayesian approach and infer the joint posterior distribution over the ancestral character states, model, and tree.&lt;ref name=HuelsenbeckBollback2001 /&gt; Huelsenbeck and Bollback first proposed&lt;ref name=HuelsenbeckBollback2001 /&gt; a hierarchical Bayes method to ancestral reconstruction by using [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) methods to sample ancestral sequences from this joint posterior distribution. A similar approach was also used to reconstruct the evolution of symbiosis with algae in fungal species ([[lichen]]ization).&lt;ref name=LutzoniPagel2001 /&gt; For example, the [[Metropolis hastings|Metropolis-Hastings algorithm]] for MCMC explores the joint posterior distribution by accepting or rejecting parameter assignments on the basis of the ratio of posterior probabilities.

Put simply, the empirical Bayes approach calculates the probabilities of various ancestral states for a specific tree and model of evolution.  By expressing the reconstruction of ancestral states as a set of probabilities, one can directly quantify the uncertainty for assigning any particular state to an ancestor.  On the other hand, the hierarchical Bayes approach averages these probabilities over all possible trees and models of evolution, in proportion to how likely these trees and models are, given the data that has been observed.

Whether the hierarchical Bayes method confers a substantial advantage in practice remains controversial, however.&lt;ref name=HansonSmithKolaczkowski2010 /&gt; Moreover, this fully Bayesian approach is limited to analyzing relatively small numbers of sequences or taxa because the space of [[Phylogenetic tree#Bifurcating tree|all possible trees]] rapidly becomes too vast, making it computationally infeasible for [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|chain samples]] to converge in a reasonable amount of time.

===Calibration===

Ancestral reconstruction can be informed by the observed states in historical samples of known age, such as fossils or archival specimens. Since the accuracy of ancestral reconstruction generally decays with increasing time, the use of such specimens provides data that are closer to the ancestors being reconstructed and will most likely improve the analysis, especially when rates of character change vary through time. This concept has been validated by an experimental evolutionary study in which replicate populations of [[T7 phage|bacteriophage T7]] were propagated to generate an artificial phylogeny.&lt;ref name=HillisBull1992 /&gt; In revisiting these experimental data, Oakley and Cunningham&lt;ref name=OakleyCunningham2000 /&gt; found that maximum parsimony methods were unable to accurately reconstruct the known ancestral state of a continuous character ([[Viral plaque|plaque size]]); these results were verified by computer simulation.  This failure of ancestral reconstruction was attributed to a directional bias in the evolution of plaque size (from large to small plaque diameters) that required the inclusion of "fossilized" samples to address.

Studies of both mammalian carnivores&lt;ref name=FinarelliFlynn2006 /&gt; and fishes&lt;ref name=AlbertJohnson2009 /&gt; have demonstrated that without incorporating fossil data, the reconstructed estimates of ancestral body sizes are unrealistically large.  Moreover, Graham Slater and colleagues showed&lt;ref name=SlaterHarmon2012 /&gt; using [[Caniformia|caniform carnivorans]] that incorporating fossil data into prior distributions improved both the Bayesian inference of ancestral states and evolutionary model selection, relative to analyses using only contemporaneous data.

==Models==

Many models have been developed to estimate ancestral states of discrete and continuous characters from extant descendants.&lt;ref name=WebsterPurvis2002 /&gt; Such models assume that the evolution of a trait through time may be modelled as a stochastic process.  For discrete-valued traits (such as "pollinator type"), this process is typically taken to be a [[Markov chain]]; for continuous-valued traits (such as "[[brain size]]"), the process is frequently taken to be a [[Brownian motion]] or an [[Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process]].  Using this model as the basis for statistical inference, one can now use [[maximum likelihood]] methods or [[Bayesian inference]] to estimate the ancestral states.

===Discrete-state models===

Suppose the trait in question may fall into one of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; states, labelled &lt;math&gt;1,\ldots, k&lt;/math&gt;.  The typical means of modelling evolution of this trait is via a continuous-time Markov chain, which may be briefly described as follows (cf. Figure 2).  Each state has associated to it rates of transition to all of the other states. The trait is modelled as stepping between the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; states; when it reaches a given state, it starts an exponential "clock" for each of the other states that it can step to.  It then "races" the clocks against each other, and it takes a step towards the state whose clock is the first to ring.  In such a model, the parameters are the transition rates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = \{q_{ij}: 1\leq i, j\leq k, i\not= j\}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be estimated using, for example, maximum likelihood methods, where one maximizes over the set of all possible configurations of states of the ancestral nodes. [[File:MC2State.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 2.  A general two-state Markov chain representing the rate of jumps from allele a to allele A. The different types of jumps are allowed to have different rates.]]

In order to recover the state of a given ancestral node in the phylogeny (call this node &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) by maximum likelihood, the procedure is: find the maximum likelihood estimate &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt;; then compute the likelihood of each possible state for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; conditioning on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} = \hat{\mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt;; finally, choose the ancestral state which maximizes this.&lt;ref name=SchluterPrice1997 /&gt;  One may also use this substitution model as the basis for a Bayesian inference procedure, which would consider the posterior belief in the state of an ancestral node given some user-chosen prior.

Because such models may have as many as &lt;math&gt;k(k-1)&lt;/math&gt; parameters, overfitting may be an issue.  Some common choices that reduce the parameter space are:

* ''Markov &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-state 1 parameter model'' (Figure 3): this   model is the reverse-in-time &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-state counterpart of the [[Models of DNA evolution#JC69 model .28Jukes and Cantor.2C 1969.29.5B1.5D|Jukes-Cantor]] model.  In this model, all transitions have the same rate &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, regardless of their start and end states.  Some transitions may be disallowed by declaring that their rates are simply 0; this may be the case, for example, if certain states cannot be reached from other states in a single transition. [[File:kState1Param.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 3.  Example of a four-state 1-parameter Markov chain model. Note that in this diagram, transitions between states A and D have been disallowed; it is conventional to not draw the arrow rather than to draw it with a rate of 0.]]
* ''Asymmetrical Markov &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-state 2 parameter model'' (Figure   4): in this model, the state space is ordered (so that, for example, state 1 is smaller than state 2, which is smaller than state 3), and transitions may only occur between adjacent states.  This model contains two parameters &lt;math&gt;q_\mbox{inc}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_\mbox{dec}&lt;/math&gt;: one for the rate of increase of state (e.g. 0 to 1, 1 to 2, etc.), and one for the rate of decrease in state (e.g. from 2 to 1, 1 to 0, etc.). [[File:Asymmetrical5State.png|300px|thumb|right|Figure 4.  Graphical representation of an asymmetrical five-state 2-parameter Markov chain model.]]

==== Example: Binary state speciation and extinction model ====

The binary state speciation and extinction model&lt;ref name=MaddisonMidford2007 /&gt; (BiSSE) is a discrete-space model that does not directly follow the framework of those mentioned above.  It allows estimation of ancestral binary character states jointly with [[diversification rates]] associated with different character states; it may also be straightforwardly extended to a more general multiple-discrete-state model.  In its most basic form, this model involves six parameters: two speciation rates (one each for lineages in states 0 and 1); similarly, two extinction rates; and two rates of character change.  This model allows for hypothesis testing on the rates of speciation/extinction/character change, at the cost of increasing the number of parameters.

===Continuous-state models===

In the case where the trait instead takes non-discrete values, one must instead turn to a model where the trait evolves as some continuous process.  Inference of ancestral states by maximum likelihood (or by Bayesian methods) would proceed as above, but with the likelihoods of transitions in state between adjacent nodes given by some other continuous probability distribution.

Plots of 200 trajectories of each of: Brownian motion with drift &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; (black); Ornstein-Uhlenbeck with &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = -4&lt;/math&gt; (green); and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck with &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = -40&lt;/math&gt; (orange).]]

* ''Brownian motion'': in this case, if nodes &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and   &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are adjacent in the phylogeny (say &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the ancestor of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) and separated by a branch of length &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the likelihood of a transition from &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; being in state &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; being in state &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is given by a Gaussian density with mean &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 t&lt;/math&gt;In this case, there is only one parameter (&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;), and the model assumes that the trait evolves freely without a bias toward increase or decrease, and that the rate of change is constant throughout the branches of the phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name="Martins1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martins | first1 = Emilia P | year = 1994 | title = 'Estimating the rate of phenotypic evolution from comparative data. | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 144 | issue = | pages = 193–209 | doi=10.1086/285670}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process'': in brief, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a continuous stochastic process that behaves like a Brownian motion, but attracted toward some central value, where the strength of the attraction increases with the distance from that value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felsenstein | first1 = J | year = 1988 | title = Phylogenies and quantitative characters | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 445–471 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.19.1.445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garland | first1 = T.

Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.&lt;/ref&gt; This is useful for modelling scenarios where the trait is subject to ''stabilizing'' selection around a certain value (say &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;). Under this model, the above-described transition of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; being in state &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; being in state &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; would have a likelihood defined by the transition density of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with two parameters: &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the variance of the driving Brownian motion, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the strength of its attraction to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  As &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the process is less and less constrained by its attraction to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and the process becomes a Brownian motion.  Because of this, the models may be nested, and log-likelihood ratio tests discerning which of the two models is appropriate may be carried out.&lt;ref name="Martins1994"/&gt;
* ''Stable models of continuous character evolution:''&lt;ref name=ElliotMooers2014 /&gt; though Brownian motion is appealing and tractable as a model of continuous evolution, it does not permit non-neutrality in its basic form, nor does it provide for any variation in the rate of evolution over time.  Instead, one may use a [[stable process]], one whose values at fixed times are distributed as [[stable distribution]]s, to model the evolution of traits.  Stable processes, roughly speaking, behave as Brownian motions that also incorporate discontinuous jumps.  This allows to appropriately model scenarios in which short bursts of fast trait evolution are expected.  In this setting, maximum likelihood methods are poorly suited due to a rugged likelihood surface and because the likelihood may be made arbitrarily large, so Bayesian methods are more appropriate.&lt;ref name=ElliotMooers2014 /&gt;

==Applications==

===Character evolution===

'''Ancestral reconstruction''' is widely used to infer the ecological, phenotypic, or biogeographic traits associated with ancestral nodes in a phylogenetic tree.  It should be noted that all methods of ancestral trait reconstructions have pitfalls, as they use mathematical models to predict how traits have changed with large amounts of missing data. This missing data includes the states of extinct species, the relative rates of evolutionary changes, knowledge of initial character states, and the accuracy of phylogenetic trees. In all cases where ancestral trait reconstruction is used, findings should be justified with an examination of the biological data that supports model based conclusions. Griffith O.W. ''et al.''&lt;ref name=GriffithBlackburn2015 /&gt;

Ancestral reconstruction allows for the study of evolutionary pathways, [[selection (biology)|adaptive selection]], and functional divergence of the evolutionary past. For a review of biological and computational techniques of ancestral reconstruction see Chang ''et al.''.&lt;ref name=ChangUgalde2005 /&gt; For criticism of ancestral reconstruction computation methods see Williams P.D. ''et al.''.&lt;ref name=WilliamsPollock2006 /&gt;

====Behavior and life history evolution====

In horned [[lizards]] (genus ''[[Phrynosoma]]''), [[viviparity]] (live birth) has evolved multiple times, based on ancestral reconstruction methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hodges | first1 = W. L. | year = 2004 | title = Evolution of viviparity in horned lizards (''Phrynosoma''): testing the cold-climate hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 1230–1237 | doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2004.00770.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Diet reconstruction in Galapagos finches=====

Both phylogenetic and character data are available for the radiation of [[finch]]es inhabiting the [[Galapagos Islands]]. These data allow testing of hypotheses concerning the timing and ordering of character state changes through time via ancestral state reconstruction. During the dry season, the diets of the 13 species of [[Darwin's Finches|Galapagos finches]] may be assorted into three broad diet categories, first those that consume grain-like foods are considered "[[Seed predation|granivores]]", those that ingest arthropods are termed "[[insectivore]]s" and those that consume vegetation are classified as "[[folivore]]s".&lt;ref name=SchluterPrice1997 /&gt; Dietary ancestral state reconstruction using maximum parsimony recover 2 major shifts from an insectivorous state: one to granivory, and one to folivory. Maximum-likelihood ancestral state reconstruction recovers broadly similar results, with one significant difference: the common ancestor of the tree finch (''[[Camarhynchus]]'') and ground finch (''[[Geospiza]]'') clades are most likely granivorous rather than insectivorous (as judged by parsimony). In this case, this difference between ancestral states returned by maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood likely occurs as a result of the fact that ML estimates consider branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name=SchluterPrice1997 /&gt;

====Morphological and physiological character evolution====

[[Phrynosomatidae|Phrynosomatid]] lizards show remarkable morphological diversity, including in the relative muscle [[Skeletal muscle|fiber type]] composition in their hindlimb [[muscles]].  Ancestor reconstruction based on squared-change parsimony (equivalent to maximum likelihood under [[Brownian motion]] character evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maddison | first1 = W. P. | year = 1991 | title = Squared-change parsimony reconstructions of ancestral states for continuous-valued characters on a phylogenetic tree | url = | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 304–314 | doi=10.1093/sysbio/40.3.304}}&lt;/ref&gt;) indicates that [[horned lizard]]s, one of the three main subclades of the lineage, have undergone a major evolutionary increase in the proportion of fast-oxidative glycolytic fibers in their iliofibularis muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonine | first1 = K. E. | year = 2005 | title = Muscle fiber-type variation in lizards (Squamata) and phylogenetic reconstruction of hypothesized ancestral states | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 208 | issue = | pages = 4529–4547 | doi=10.1242/jeb.01903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mammalian body mass=====

In an analysis of the body mass of 1,679 [[Placentalia|placental mammal]] species comparing stable models of continuous character evolution to [[Brownian motion]] models, Elliot and Mooers&lt;ref name=ElliotMooers2014 /&gt; showed that the evolutionary process describing mammalian body mass evolution is best characterized by a [[Stable distribution|stable model]] of continuous character evolution, which accommodates rare changes of large magnitude. Under a stable model, ancestral mammals retained a low body mass through early diversification, with large increases in body mass coincident with the origin of several Orders of large body massed species (e.g. ungulates). By contrast, simulation under a Brownian motion model recovered a less realistic, order of magnitude larger body mass among ancestral mammals, requiring significant reductions in body size prior to the evolution of Orders exhibiting small body size (e.g. [[Rodent]]ia). Thus stable models recover a more realistic picture of mammalian body mass evolution by permitting large transformations to occur on a small subset of branches.&lt;ref name=ElliotMooers2014 /&gt;

=====Correlated character evolution=====

[[Phylogenetic comparative methods]] (inferences drawn through comparison of related taxa) are often used to identify biological characteristics that do not evolve independently, which can reveal an underlying dependence.  For example, the evolution of the shape of a finch's beak may be associated with its foraging behaviour. However, it is not advisable to search for these associations by the direct comparison of measurements or genetic sequences because these observations are not independent because of their descent from common ancestors. For discrete characters, this problem was first addressed in the framework of maximum parsimony by evaluating whether two characters tended to undergo a change on the same branches of the tree.&lt;ref name=Ridley1983 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Maddison1990 /&gt; [[Joseph Felsenstein|Felsenstein]] identified this problem for continuous character evolution and proposed a solution similar to ancestral reconstruction, in which the phylogenetic structure of the data was accommodated statistically by directing the analysis through computation of "independent contrasts" between nodes of the tree related by non-overlapping branches.&lt;ref name=Felsenstein1985 /&gt;

====Molecular evolution====

On a molecular level, [[Amino acid|amino acid residues]] at different locations of a protein may evolve non-independently because they have a direct physicochemical interaction, or indirectly by their interactions with a common substrate or through long-range interactions in the protein structure.  Conversely, the folded structure of a protein could potentially be inferred from the distribution of residue interactions.&lt;ref name=GobelSander1994 /&gt; One of the earliest applications of ancestral reconstruction, to predict the [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure of a protein]] through residue contacts, was published by Shindyalov and colleagues.&lt;ref name=ShindyalovKolchanov1994 /&gt; Phylogenies relating 67 different protein families were generated by a distance-based clustering method ([[UPGMA|unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean]], UPGMA), and ancestral sequences were reconstructed by parsimony. The authors reported a weak but significant tendency for [[Coevolution|co-evolving]] pairs of residues to be co-located in the known three-dimensional structure of the proteins.

The reconstruction of ancient proteins and DNA sequences has only recently become a significant scientific endeavour. The developments of extensive genomic sequence databases in conjunction with advances in biotechnology and phylogenetic inference methods have made ancestral reconstruction cheap, fast, and scientifically practical. This concept has been applied to identify co-evolving residues in protein sequences using more advanced methods for the reconstruction of phylogenies and ancestral sequences. For example, ancestral reconstruction has been used to identify co-evolving residues in proteins encoded by RNA virus genomes, particularly in HIV.&lt;ref name=KorberFarber1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shapiro2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PoonLewis2007 /&gt;

Ancestral [[protein]] and [[DNA]] reconstruction allows for the recreation of protein and DNA evolution in the laboratory so that it can be studied directly.&lt;ref name=ChangUgalde2005 /&gt; With respect to proteins, this allows for the investigation of the evolution of present-day molecular structure and function. Additionally, ancestral protein reconstruction can lead to the discoveries of new biochemical functions that have been lost in modern proteins.&lt;ref name=JermannOpitz1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SadqideAlba2009 /&gt; It also allows insights into the biology and ecology of extinct organisms.&lt;ref name=ChangJonsson2002 /&gt; Although the majority of ancestral reconstructions have dealt with proteins, it has also been used to test evolutionary mechanisms at the level of bacterial genomes&lt;ref name=ZhangZhang2003 /&gt; and primate gene sequences.&lt;ref name=Krishnan2004 /&gt;

=====Vaccine design=====

RNA viruses such as the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) evolve at an extremely rapid rate, orders of magnitude faster than mammals or birds. For these organisms, ancestral reconstruction can be applied on a much shorter time scale; for example, in order to reconstruct the global or regional progenitor of an [[epidemic]] that has spanned decades rather than millions of years.  A team around Brian Gaschen proposed&lt;ref name=Gaschen2002 /&gt; that such reconstructed strains be used as targets for [[vaccine]] design efforts, as opposed to sequences isolated from patients in the present day. Because HIV is extremely diverse, a vaccine designed to work on one patient's viral population might not work for a different patient, because the evolutionary distance between these two viruses may be large. However, their most recent common ancestor is closer to each of the two viruses than they are to each other. Thus, a vaccine designed for a common ancestor could have a better chance of being effective for a larger proportion of circulating strains. Another team took this idea further by developing a center-of-tree reconstruction method to produce a sequence whose total evolutionary distance to contemporary strains is as small as possible.&lt;ref name=RollandJensen2007 /&gt; Strictly speaking, this method was not ''ancestral'' reconstruction, as the center-of-tree (COT) sequence does not necessarily represent a sequence that has ever existed in the evolutionary history of the virus. However, Rolland and colleagues did find that, in the case of HIV, the COT virus was functional when synthesized. Similar experiments with synthetic ancestral sequences obtained by maximum likelihood reconstruction have likewise shown that these ancestors are both functional and immunogenic,&lt;ref name=KotheLi2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DoriaRoseLearn2005 /&gt; lending some credibility to these methods.  Furthermore, ancestral reconstruction can potentially be used to infer the genetic sequence of the transmitted HIV variants that have gone on to establish the next infection, with the objective of identifying distinguishing characteristics of these variants (as a non-random selection of the transmitted population of viruses) that may be targeted for vaccine design.&lt;ref name=McCloskeyLiang2014 /&gt;

=====Genome rearrangements=====

Rather than inferring the ancestral DNA sequence, one may be interested in the larger-scale molecular structure and content of an ancestral genome. This problem is often approached in a combinatorial framework, by modelling genomes as [[permutation]]s of genes or homologous regions. Various operations are allowed on these permutations, such as an [[Chromosomal inversion|inversion]] (a segment of the permutation is reversed in-place), [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion]] (a segment is removed), [[Transposable element|transposition]] (a segment is removed from one part of the permutation and spliced in somewhere else), or gain of genetic content through [[Homologous recombination|recombination]], [[Gene duplication|duplication]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]]. The "genome rearrangement problem", first posed by Watterson and colleagues,&lt;ref name= WattersonEwens1982 /&gt; asks: given two genomes (permutations) and a set of allowable operations, what is the shortest sequence of operations that will transform one genome into the other?  A generalization of this problem applicable to ancestral reconstruction is the "multiple genome rearrangement problem":&lt;ref name=BorquePevzner2002 /&gt; given a set of genomes and a set of allowable operations, find (i) a binary tree with the given genomes as its leaves, and (ii) an assignment of genomes to the internal nodes of the tree, such that the total number of operations across the whole tree is minimized.  This approach is similar to parsimony, except that the tree is inferred along with the ancestral sequences.  Unfortunately, even the single genome rearrangement problem is [[NP-hard]],&lt;ref name=EvenGoldreich1981 /&gt; although it has received much attention in mathematics and computer science (for a review, see Fertin and colleagues&lt;ref name=FertinLabarre2009 /&gt;).

The reconstruction of ancestral genomes is also called [[karyotype]] reconstruction. Chromosome painting is currently the main experimental technique.&lt;ref name=Wienberg2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Froenicke2006 /&gt; Recently, researchers have developed computational methods to reconstruct the ancestral karyotype by taking advantage of [[comparative genomics]].&lt;ref name=Murphy2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MaZhang2006 /&gt; Furthermore, comparative genomics and ancestral genome reconstruction has been applied to identify ancient horizontal gene transfer events at the last common ancestor of a lineage (e.g. ''Candidatus'' Accumulibacter phosphatis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oyserman|first=Ben O.|last2=Moya|first2=Francisco|last3=Lawson|first3=Christopher E.|last4=Garcia|first4=Antonio L.|last5=Vogt|first5=Mark|last6=Heffernen|first6=Mitchell|last7=Noguera|first7=Daniel R.|last8=McMahon|first8=Katherine D.|date=2016-04-29|title=Ancestral genome reconstruction identifies the evolutionary basis for trait acquisition in polyphosphate accumulating bacteria|url=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ismej201667a.html|journal=The ISME Journal|language=en|doi=10.1038/ismej.2016.67|issn=1751-7370|volume=10|pages=2931–2945|pmc=5148189}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to identify the evolutionary basis for trait acquisition.

====Spatial applications====

=====Migration=====

Ancestral reconstruction is not limited to biological traits.  Spatial location is also a trait, and ancestral reconstruction methods can infer the locations of ancestors of the individuals under consideration.  Such techniques were used by Lemey and colleagues&lt;ref name= FraserLemey2009 /&gt; to geographically trace the ancestors of 192 [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|Avian influenza A-H5N1]] strains sampled from twenty localities in Europe and Asia, and for 101 [[rabies virus]] sequences sampled across twelve African countries.

Treating locations as discrete states (countries, cities, etc.) allows for the application of the discrete-state models described above. However, unlike in a model where the state space for the trait is small, there may be many locations, and transitions between certain pairs of states may rarely or never occur; for example, migration between distant locales may never happen directly if air travel between the two places does not exist, so such migrations must pass through intermediate locales first.  This means that there could be many parameters in the model which are zero or close to zero.  To this end, Lemey and colleagues used a Bayesian procedure to not only estimate the parameters and ancestral states, but also to select which migration parameters are not zero; their work suggests that this procedure does lead to more efficient use of the data.  They also explore the use of prior distributions that incorporate geographical structure or hypotheses about migration dynamics, finding that those they considered had little effect on the findings.

Using this analysis, the team around Lemey found that the most likely hub of diffusion of A-H5N1 is [[Guangdong]], with [[Hong Kong]] also receiving posterior support.  Further, their results support the hypothesis of long-standing presence of African rabies in [[West Africa]].

=====Species ranges=====

Inferring historical [[Biogeography|biogeographic]] patterns often requires reconstructing ancestral ranges of species on phylogenetic trees.&lt;ref name=ClarkRee2008 /&gt; For instance, a well-resolved phylogeny of plant species in the genus ''[[Cyrtandra (plant)|Cyrtandra]]''&lt;ref name=ClarkRee2008 /&gt; was used together with information of their geographic ranges to compare four methods of ancestral range reconstruction. The team compared Fitch parsimony,&lt;ref name=Fitch1971 /&gt; (FP; parsimony) stochastic mapping&lt;ref name=HuelsenbeckNielsen2003 /&gt; (SM; maximum likelihood), [[Vicariance|dispersal-vicariance]] analysis&lt;ref name=Ronquist1996 /&gt; (DIVA; parsimony), and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis&lt;ref name=ReeSmith2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ReeMoore2005 /&gt; (DEC; maximum-likelihood).  Results indicated that both parsimony methods performed poorly, which was likely due to the fact that parsimony methods do not consider branch lengths. Both maximum-likelihood methods performed better; however, DEC analyses that additionally allow incorporation of geological priors gave more realistic inferences about range evolution in ''Cyrtandra'' relative to other methods.&lt;ref name=ClarkRee2008 /&gt;

Another maximum likelihood method recovers the phylogeographic history of a gene&lt;ref name=LemmonLemmon2008 /&gt; by reconstructing the ancestral locations of the sampled taxa.  This method assumes a spatially explicit random walk model of migration to reconstruct ancestral locations given the geographic coordinates of the individuals represented by the tips of the phylogenetic tree. When applied to a phylogenetic tree of chorus frogs [[Upland chorus frog|''Pseudacris feriarum'']], this method recovered recent northward expansion, higher per-generation dispersal distance in the recently colonized region, a non-central ancestral location, and directional migration.&lt;ref name=LemmonLemmon2008 /&gt;

[[File:flies.png|500px|thumb|right|Figure 6. Phylogeny of 7 regional strains of Drosophila pseudoobscura, as inferred by [[Alfred Sturtevant|Sturtevant]] and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]].&lt;ref name=SturtevantDobzhansky1936 /&gt; Displayed sequences do not correspond to the original paper, but were derived from the notation in the authors' companion paper&lt;ref name=DobzhanskySturtevant1937 /&gt; as follows: A (63A-65B), B (65C-68D), C (69A-70A), D (70B-70D), E (71A-71B), F (71A-73C), G (74A-74C), H (75A-75C), I (76A-76B), J (76C-77B), K (78A-79D), L (80A-81D). Inversions inferred by the authors are highlighted in blue along branches.]]

The first consideration of the multiple genome rearrangement problem, long before its formalization in terms of permutations, was presented by Sturtevant and Dobzhansky in 1936.&lt;ref name=SturtevantDobzhansky1936 /&gt; They examined genomes of several strains of [[Drosophila pseudoobscura|fruit fly]] from different geographic locations, and observed that one configuration, which they called "standard", was the most common throughout all the studied areas. Remarkably, they also noticed that four different strains could be obtained from the standard sequence by a single inversion, and two others could be related by a second inversion. This allowed them to hypothesize a phylogeny for the sequences, and to infer that the standard sequence was probably also the ancestral one.

====Linguistic Evolution====

Reconstructions of the words and phenomes of ancient [[proto-language]]s such as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] have been performed based on the observed analogues in present-day languages. Typically, these analyses are carried out manually using the "comparative method".&lt;ref name=Campbell1998 /&gt; First, words from different languages with a common etymology ([[cognate]]s) are identified in the contemporary languages under study, analogous to the identification of [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthologous]] biological sequences. Second, correspondences between individual sounds in the cognates are identified, a step similar to biological [[sequence alignment]], although performed manually. Finally, likely ancestral sounds are hypothesised by manual inspection and various heuristics (such as the fact that most languages have both [[Nasal vowel|nasal and non-nasal vowels]]).&lt;ref name= Campbell1998 /&gt;

==Software==

There are many software packages available which can perform ancestral state reconstruction.  Generally, these software packages have been developed and maintained through the efforts of scientists in related fields and released under [[free software license]]s.  The following table is not meant to be a comprehensive itemization of all available packages, but provides a representative sample of the extensive variety of packages that implement methods of ancestral reconstruction with different strengths and features.

=== Package descriptions ===

==== Molecular evolution ====

The majority of these software packages are designed for analyzing genetic sequence data.  For example, PAML&lt;ref name=Yang2007 /&gt; is a collection of programs for the phylogenetic analysis of DNA and protein sequence alignments by maximum likelihood. Ancestral reconstruction can be performed using the ''codeml'' program.  In addition, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150307220356/http://markov.uoregon.edu/software/lazarus/ LAZARUS] is a collection of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scripts that wrap the ancestral reconstruction functions of PAML for batch processing and greater ease-of-use. [http://hyphy.org/w/index.php/Main_Page HyPhy], [http://mesquiteproject.org/Mesquite_Folder/docs/mesquite/manual.html Mesquite], and [http://www.megasoftware.net/ MEGA] are also software packages for the phylogenetic analysis of sequence data, but are designed to be more modular and customizable.  HyPhy&lt;ref name=PondFrost2004 /&gt; implements a joint maximum likelihood method of ancestral sequence reconstruction&lt;ref name=PupkoPe2000 /&gt; that can be readily adapted to reconstructing a more generalized range of discrete ancestral character states such as geographic locations by specifying a customized model in its batch language.  Mesquite&lt;ref name=Maddison2015 /&gt; provides ancestral state reconstruction methods for both discrete and continuous characters using both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods.  It also provides several visualization tools for interpreting the results of ancestral reconstruction.  MEGA&lt;ref name=TamuraStecher2013 /&gt; is a modular system, too, but places greater emphasis on ease-of-use than customization of analyses.  As of version 5, MEGA allows the user to reconstruct ancestral states using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and empirical Bayes methods.&lt;ref name=TamuraStecher2013 /&gt;

The Bayesian analysis of genetic sequences may confer greater robustness to model misspecification.  MrBayes&lt;ref name=RonquistHuelsenbeck2003 /&gt; allows inference of ancestral states at ancestral nodes using the full hierarchical Bayesian approach.  The PREQUEL program distributed in the PHAST package&lt;ref name=HubiszPollard2010 /&gt; performs comparative evolutionary genomics using ancestral sequence reconstruction. SIMMAP&lt;ref name=Bollback2006 /&gt;  stochastically maps mutations on phylogenies. BayesTraits&lt;ref name=Pagel1999 /&gt; analyses discrete or continuous characters in a Bayesian framework to evaluate models of evolution, reconstruct ancestral states, and detect correlated evolution between pairs of traits.

==== Other character types ====

&lt;!-- References are done up to here, but it keeps crashing when I try to paste stuff in. --&gt;

Other software packages are more oriented towards the analysis of qualitative and quantitative traits ([[phenotype]]s).  For example, the ''ape'' package&lt;ref name=Paradis2012 /&gt; in the statistical computing environment [[R (programming language)|R]] also provides methods for ancestral state reconstruction for both discrete and continuous characters through the [http://www.r-phylo.org/wiki/HowTo/Ancestral_State_Reconstruction ''ace''] function, including maximum likelihood.  (Note that ''ace'' performs reconstruction by computing scaled conditional likelihoods instead of the marginal or joint likelihoods used by other maximum likelihood-based methods for ancestral reconstruction, which may adversely affect the accuracy of reconstruction at nodes other than the root [https://web.archive.org/web/20151208065712/https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-phylo/2013-March/002584.html].) Phyrex implements a maximum parsimony-based algorithm to reconstruct ancestral gene expression profiles, in addition to a maximum likelihood method for reconstructing ancestral genetic sequences (by wrapping around the baseml function in PAML).&lt;ref name=RossnesEidhammer2005 /&gt;

Several software packages also reconstruct [[phylogeography]].  BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees&lt;ref name=DrummondSuchard2012 /&gt;) provides tools for reconstructing ancestral geographic locations from observed sequences annotated with location data using Bayesian [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|MCMC]] sampling methods.  Diversitree&lt;ref name=FitzJohn2012 /&gt; is an R package providing methods for ancestral state reconstruction under Mk2 (a [[Continuous-time Markov chain|continuous time Markov model]] of binary character evolution.&lt;ref name=Pagel1994 /&gt;) and BiSSE (Binary State Speciation and Extinction) models.  Lagrange performs analyses on reconstruction of geographic range evolution on phylogenetic trees.&lt;ref name=ReeSmith2008 /&gt;  Phylomapper&lt;ref name=LemmonLemmon2008 /&gt; is a statistical framework for estimating historical patterns of gene flow and ancestral geographic locations.  RASP&lt;ref name=YuHarris2010 /&gt; infers ancestral states using statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis, Lagrange, Bayes-Lagrange, BayArea and BBM methods.  VIP&lt;ref name=AriasSzumik2011 /&gt; infers historical biogeography by examining disjunct geographic distributions.

Genome rearrangements provide valuable information in [[comparative genomics]] between species. ANGES&lt;ref name=JonesRajaraman2012 /&gt; compares extant related genomes through ancestral reconstruction of genetic markers. BADGER&lt;ref name=LargetKadane2005 /&gt; uses a Bayesian approach to examining the history of gene rearrangement.  Count&lt;ref name=Csuos2010 /&gt; reconstructs the evolution of the size of gene families.  EREM&lt;ref name=CarmelWolf2010 /&gt; analyses the gain and loss of genetic features encoded by binary characters.  PARANA&lt;ref name=PatroSefer2012 /&gt; performs parsimony based inference of ancestral biological networks that represent gene loss and duplication.

==== Web applications ====

Finally, there are several web-server based applications that allow investigators to use maximum likelihood methods for ancestral reconstruction of different character types without having to install any software.  For example, Ancestors&lt;ref name=DialloMakarenkov2009 /&gt; is web-server for ancestral genome reconstruction by the identification and arrangement of [[Synteny|syntenic]] regions.  FastML&lt;ref name=AshkenazyPenn2012 /&gt; is a web-server for probabilistic reconstruction of ancestral sequences by maximum likelihood that uses a gap character model for reconstructing [[indel]] variation.  MLGO&lt;ref name=HuLin2014 /&gt; is a web-server for maximum likelihood gene order analysis.

==Future directions==

The development and application of computational algorithms for ancestral reconstruction continues to be an active area of research across disciplines.  For example, the reconstruction of sequence insertions and deletions (indels) has lagged behind the more straightforward application of substitution models.  Bouchard-Côté and Jordan recently described a new model (the Poisson Indel Process&lt;ref name=BouchardCoteJordan2012 /&gt;) which represents an important advance on the archetypal Thorne-Kishino-Felsenstein model of indel evolution.&lt;ref name=ThorneKishino1991 /&gt; In addition, the field is being driven forward by rapid advances in the area of [[DNA sequencing#Next-generation methods|next-generation sequencing]] technology, where sequences are generated from millions of nucleic acid templates by extensive parallelization of sequencing reactions in a custom apparatus. These advances have made it possible to generate a [[Deep sequencing|"deep" snapshot]] of the genetic composition of a rapidly evolving population, such as RNA viruses&lt;ref name=FraserPoon2012 /&gt; or tumour cells,&lt;ref name=BeerenwinkelSchwarz2014 /&gt; in a relatively short amount of time.  At the same time, the massive amount of data and platform-specific sequencing error profiles has created new bioinformatic challenges for processing these data for ancestral sequence reconstruction.

'''Attorney misconduct''' is unethical or illegal conduct by an attorney.  Attorney Misconduct may include: [[conflict of interest]], over billing, refusing to represent a client for political or professional motives, false or misleading statements, hiding evidence, abandoning a client, failing to disclose all relevant facts, arguing a position while neglecting to disclose prior law which might counter the argument, and'' in some instances'' having sex with a client.

The advent of electronic record keeping and "e-discovery" has also resulted in a record number of attorney sanctions for a range of abuses from failure to produce to the leaking of sealed documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.findlaw.com/strategist/2011/01/attorney-e-discovery-sanctions-at-all-time-high.html Attorney E-Discovery Sanctions At All-Time High], FindLaw blog, January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a case highlighting such abuses, in 2007 plaintiff's in a pharmaceutical lawsuit were found to conspire with attorneys and journalists to publicize protected discovery documents defying a judge's [[protective order]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlf.org/upload/042707womeldorf.pdf When conspirators defy protective orders], Washington Legal Foundation, April 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Durham County, North Carolina prosecutor, [[Mike Nifong]], gained national infamy for a pattern of '''attorney misconduct''' related to the [[2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal]].

[[Legal malpractice]] is a separate concept such as when an attorney fails to adequately, professionally, competently, or zealously represent a client.  While malpractice and misconduct may often be found in the same matter, they are separate concepts and need not both exist.

==Codification of rules and enforcement==

The [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) has established model rules of professional conduct expected of attorneys, which most states in the U.S. have incorporated as part of their state laws.  Each state issues its own set of rules governing the ethical rules and the related enforcement of those rules, generally through their state [[bar association]]s.  As the state bar organizations and their enforcement mechanisms are composed of lawyers who set the rules, the regulation of attorney ethics is [[Industry self-regulation|self regulated and self policed]].  The self-regulation of any industry by its economic participants poses an inherent [[conflict of interest]] between the professional objectives of the members of the profession and those for whom the regulation would protect.  Some academic researchers and industry pundits have asserted that attorney discipline in the U.S. is ineffective,&lt;ref&gt;Leslie C. Levin, The Emperor's Clothes and Other Tales About the Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline Sanctions, 48 American University Law Review 1 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paula A. Monopoli, Legal Ethics and Practical Politics: Musings on the Public Perception of Lawyer Discipline, 10 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 423, 425 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and favors lawyers and law firms.&lt;ref&gt;William T. Gallagher, "Ideologies of Professionalism and the Politics of Self-Regulation in the California State Bar," 22 Pepp. L. Rev. 485, 490-491.(1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual lawyers or their firms may be cited for misconduct by a judge in the originating proceedings or by a corresponding state bar.

An '''aurora''' (plural: '''auroras''' or '''aurorae'''),{{efn|The name "auroras"  is now the more common plural of "aurora", however ''aurorae'' is the original Latin plural and is often used by scientists; in some contexts, aurora is an uncountable noun, multiple sightings being referred to as "the aurora".

Modern style guides recommend that the names of [[meteorological phenomena]], such as aurora borealis, be uncapitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html#Anchor-37516 |title=University of Minnesota Style Manual |publisher=.umn.edu |date=18 July 2007 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722101345/http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html#Anchor-37516 |archivedate=22 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} sometimes referred to as '''polar lights''', '''northern lights''' (aurora borealis) or '''southern lights''' (aurora australis), is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the [[polar regions of Earth|high-latitude regions]] (around the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]]).

Auroras are produced when the [[magnetosphere]] is sufficiently disturbed by the [[solar wind]] that the trajectories of [[charged particle]]s in both solar wind and [[Van Allen belt|magnetospheric plasma]], mainly in the form of [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s, precipitate them into the upper atmosphere ([[thermosphere]]/[[exosphere]]) due to [[Earth's magnetic field]], where their energy is lost.

The resulting [[ionization]] and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying color and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident [[hydrogen]] atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auspace.athabascau.ca/handle/2149/518 |title=Simultaneous ground and satellite observations of an isolated proton arc at sub-auroral latitudes |publisher=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=2007 |accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "aurora" comes from the Latin word for "dawn, morning light", since auroras were formerly thought to be the first light of dawn.

==Occurrence of terrestrial auroras==
Most auroras occur in a band known as the "auroral zone",&lt;ref name="feldstein86"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feldstein |first=Y. I. |year=2011 |title=A Quarter Century with the Auroral Oval |journal=EOS |volume=67 |issue=40 |page=761 |doi=10.1029/EO067i040p00761-02 |bibcode=1986EOSTr..67..761F }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is typically 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the [[geomagnetic pole]]s at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a dark sky. A region that currently displays an aurora is called the "auroral oval", a band displaced towards the night side of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gLwCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Occurrence+of+terrestrial+auroras#v=onepage&amp;q=Occurrence%20of%20terrestrial%20auroras|title=Illustrated Glossary for Solar and Solar-Terrestrial Physics|last=Bruzek|first=A.|last2=Durrant|first2=C. J.|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789401012454|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. [[Elias Loomis]] (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881)&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, Hermann (1881). "Das Polarlicht."&lt;/ref&gt; and S. Tromholt (1882)&lt;ref&gt;Tromholt, S. (1882) Om nordlysets perioder/Sur les périodes de l'aurore boréale, l'annuaire 1880, Inst. Météorol. Danois, Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt; in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone. Day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=SpaceWeather |url=http://www.spaceweather.com/ |title=Current Auroral Oval |accessdate=19 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern [[latitude]]s, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The former term was coined by [[Galileo]] in 1619, from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Aurora (mythology)|goddess of the dawn]] and the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the north wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1029/HG002p0011 |chapter=An historical footnote on the origin of 'aurora borealis' |title=History of Geophysics: Volume 2 |journal=History of Geophysics: Volume 2.

L. |isbn=978-0-87590-276-0|bibcode = 1986HGeo....2...11S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the southern lights, has features  almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jastp.2006.05.026 |title=Auroral conjugacy studies based on global imaging |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=249 |year=2007 |last1=Østgaard |first1=N. |last2=Mende |first2=S.

M. |bibcode=2007JASTP..69..249O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aurora Australis is visible from high southern latitudes in [[Antarctica]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]].

A [[geomagnetic storm]] causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, and bring the aurora to lower latitudes. The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval")&lt;ref name="feldstein86" /&gt; is slightly different, being centered about 3–5° nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic pole]] in question is in between the observer and the [[Sun]]. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called [[magnetic midnight]].

Auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead, but from farther away, they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frey |first=H. U. |year=2007 |title=Localized aurora beyond the auroral oval |doi=10.1029/2005RG000174 |journal=Rev.

Auroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone, when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval. Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the 11-year [[sunspot|sunspot cycle]] or during the three years after the peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stamper |first1=J. |first2=M. |last2=Lockwood |first3=M.

An aurora may appear overhead as a "corona" of rays, radiating from a distant and apparent central location, which results from [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]].
An electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B. This angle is known as the "pitch angle" of the particle. The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius. The pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere. Thus, it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90° before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there. Other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes.
Other types of auroras have been observed from space, e.g."poleward arcs" stretching sunward across the polar cap, the related "theta aurora",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1029/2003GL017914 |title=Observations of non-conjugate theta aurora |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=30 |issue=21 |pages=2125 |year=2003 |last1=Østgaard |first1=N. |bibcode=2003GeoRL..30.2125O }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "dayside arcs" near noon. These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood. Other interesting effects occur such as flickering aurora, "black aurora" and subvisual red arcs. In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the ones that close through the Earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely.

The altitudes where auroral emissions occur were revealed by Carl Størmer and his colleagues, who used cameras to triangulate more than 12,000 auroras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Størmer |first1=Carl |title=Frequency of 12,330 measured heights of aurora from southern Norway in the years 1911–1944 |journal=Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity |year=1946 |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=501–504 |doi=10.1029/te051i004p00501 |bibcode=1946TeMAE..51..501S }}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that most of the light is produced between 90 and 150&amp;nbsp;km above the ground, while extending at times to more than 1000&amp;nbsp;km.
Images of auroras are significantly more common today than in the past due to the increase in the use of [[digital camera]]s that have high enough sensitivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/ |title=News and information about meteor showers, solar flares, auroras, and near-Earth asteroids |publisher=SpaceWeather.com |accessdate=5 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100804164127/http://spaceweather.com//| archivedate= 4 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties. Due to the different color spectra present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable. Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of a film can be very important. Longer exposures superimpose rapidly changing features, and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display. Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.

[[David Malin]] pioneered multiple exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography, recombining the images in the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidmalin.com/index.html |title=Astronomical photographs from David Malin Images |publisher=davidmalin.com |accessdate=3 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For scientific research, proxies are often used, such as ultraviolet, and color-correction to simulate the appearance to humans.

===Visual forms and colors===
Auroras frequently appear either as a diffuse glow or as "curtains" that extend approximately in the east–west direction. At some times, they form "quiet arcs"; at others, they evolve and change constantly. These are called "active aurora".

The most distinctive and brightest are the curtain-like auroral arcs. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. ''In situ'' particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or break up into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the discrete auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00585-997-0943-z |title=Magnetospheric source region of discrete auroras inferred from their relationship with isotropy boundaries of energetic particles |journal=Annales Geophysicae |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=943 |year=1997 |last1=Yahnin |first1=A.

The diffuse aurora, though, is a relatively featureless glow sometimes close to the limit of visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6826(96)00113-7 |title=Polar cap arcs: A review |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |volume=59 |issue=10 |pages=1087 |year=1997 |last1=Zhu |first1=L. |last2=Schunk |first2=R. W. |last3=Sojka |first3=J. J. |bibcode=1997JASTP..59.1087Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be distinguished from moonlit clouds because stars can be seen undiminished through the glow. Diffuse auroras are often composed of patches whose brightness exhibits regular or near-regular pulsations. The pulsation period can be typically many seconds, so is not always obvious. Often there black aurora i.e. narrow regions in diffuse aurora with reduced luminosity. A typical auroral display consists of these forms appearing in the above order throughout the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=A |first=Brekke |last2=A |first2=Egeland |title=The Northern Lights |date=1994 |publisher=Grøndahl and Dreyer, Oslo |isbn=978-82-504-2105-9 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Red''': At the highest altitudes, excited atomic oxygen emits at 630&amp;nbsp;nm (red); low concentration of atoms and lower sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this color visible only under more intense solar activity. The low number of oxygen atoms and their gradually diminishing concentration is responsible for the faint appearance of the top parts of the "curtains". Scarlet, crimson, and carmine are the most often-seen hues of red for the auroras.
* '''Green''': At lower altitudes, the more frequent collisions suppress the 630-nm (red) mode: rather the 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm emission (green) dominates. Fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common. The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to high stability of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength. (Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.) The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100&amp;nbsp;km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains. Both the 557.7 and 630.0&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths correspond to [[forbidden transition]]s of atomic oxygen, slow mechanism that is responsible for the graduality (0.7&amp;nbsp;s and 107&amp;nbsp;s respectively) of flaring and fading.
* '''Blue''': At yet lower altitudes, atomic oxygen is uncommon, and molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen take over in producing visible light emission, radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum, with 428&amp;nbsp;nm (blue) being dominant. Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the "curtains", show up at the highest levels of solar activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows to the Universe – Auroral colors and spectra|url=http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Magnetosphere/tour/tour_earth_magnetosphere_09.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones.
* '''Ultraviolet''': Ultraviolet radiation from auroras (within the optical window but not visible to virtually all humans) has been observed with the requisite equipment. Ultraviolet auroras have also been seen on Mars,&lt;ref name="sci-news.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-news.com/space/science-nasas-maven-ultraviolet-aurora-mars-02614.html|title=NASA's MAVEN Orbiter Detects Ultraviolet Aurora on Mars &amp;#124; Space Exploration &amp;#124; Sci-News.com|publisher=sci-news.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter and Saturn.
* '''Infrared''': Infrared radiation, in wavelengths that are within the optical window, is also part of many auroras.&lt;ref name="sci-news.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dapep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dapep.org/DAPT/EM-Wiki/aurora-borealis.html|title=Aurora Borealis|publisher=dapep.org|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Yellow''' and '''pink''' are [[Additive colour|a mix]] of red and green or blue. Other shades of red, as well as orange, may be seen on rare occasions; yellow-green is moderately common. As red, green, and blue are the primary colours of additive synthesis of colours, in theory, practically any colour might be possible, but the ones mentioned in this article comprise a virtually exhaustive list.

===Other auroral radiation===
In addition, the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150&amp;nbsp;kHz known as [[auroral kilometric radiation]] (AKR), discovered in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gurnett |first1=D.A. |title=The Earth as a radio source |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1974 |volume=79 |issue=79 |page=4227 |bibcode=1974JGR....79.4227G |doi=10.1029/JA079i028p04227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ionospheric absorption makes AKR only observable from space. X-ray emissions, originating from the particles associated with auroras, have also been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=K.A. |title=Balloon observations of X-rays in the auroral zone |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1960 |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=551–564 |doi=10.1029/jz065i002p00551 |bibcode=1960JGR....65..551A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aurora noise ===
Aurora [[noise]], similar to a hissing, or crackling noise, begins about {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the Earth's surface and is caused by charged particles in an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night. The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer, creating the noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/auroras-sounds-noises-explained-earth-space-astronomy|title=Auroras Make Weird Noises, and Now We Know Why|date=2016-06-27|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elec.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2016-06-22/|title=News: Acoustics researcher finds explanation for auroral sounds|date=2016-06-21|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of auroras==
A full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete, but the basic cause involves the interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the [[Earth's magnetosphere]]. The varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes, but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.
# A quiescent solar wind flowing past the Earth's magnetosphere steadily interacts with it and can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are 'open', as opposed to being 'closed' in the opposite hemisphere, and provide diffusion through the [[bow shock]]. It can also cause particles already trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt|radiation belts]] to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted. In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic"), and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the [[ionosphere]]. Such replacement of "hot" electrons by "cold" ones is in complete accord with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]]. The complete process, which also generates an electric ring current around the Earth, is uncertain.
# Geomagnetic disturbance from an enhanced [[solar wind]] causes distortions of the [[magnetosphere|magnetotail]] ("magnetic substorms"). These 'substorms' tend to occur after prolonged spells (hours) during which the interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component. This leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth. As a result, the solar wind moves [[magnetic flux]] (tubes of magnetic field lines, 'locked' together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side. Ultimately some tail plasma can separate ("[[magnetic reconnection]]"); some blobs ("[[plasmoid]]s") are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight ("unloading process"). A geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing enhancement of the "ring current". Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone. 
#: [[File:Moon and Aurora.jpg|thumb|Moon and Aurora]]
# Acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which is believed to predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle in the direction of the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased, and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energising processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.
[[Image:Aurora australis 20050911.jpg|right|thumb|Aurora australis (11 September 2005) as captured by NASA's [[IMAGE]] satellite, digitally overlaid onto ''[[The Blue Marble]]'' composite image.
[[:Image:Aurora Australis.gif|An animation]] created using the same satellite data is also available]]
The details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones, and temporarily magnetically trapped, particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burch |first1=J L |editor1-last=Akasofu S-I and Y Kamide |title=The solar wind and the Earth |date=1987 |publisher=D. Reidel |isbn=978-90-277-2471-7 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2016 more than fifty [[citizen science]] observations (under the aegis of Aurorasaurus) observed a heretofore unknown type of aurora which was dubbed "[[Steve (atmospheric phenomenon)|STEVE]]" (a reference to the animated film [[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]] in which one of the characters randomly names a previously unknown creature "Steve"); subsequent reportage went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]], and STEVE remains under active scientific investigation.&lt;ref name="STEVE"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.aurorasaurus.org/?p=449 |title=7 Things to Know About "STEVE" |date=2017-03-14 |website=Aurorasaurus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auroral particles===
The immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McIlwain |first1=C E |title=Direct Measurement of Particles Producing Visible Auroras |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1960 |volume=65 |issue=9 |page=2727 |doi=10.1029/JZ065i009p02727 |bibcode=1960JGR....65.2727M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000&amp;nbsp;km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA093iA07p07441 |title=Determination of auroral electrostatic potentials using high- and low-altitude particle distributions |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=93 |issue=A7 |pages=7441 |year=1988 |last1=Reiff |first1=P.

A. |last8=Friedman |first8=M. A. |bibcode=1988JGR....93.7441R }}&lt;/ref&gt; These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.
Electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/215045a0 |title=Evidence for Velocity Dispersion in Auroral Electrons |journal=Nature |volume=215 |issue=5096 |pages=45 |year=1967 |last1=Bryant |first1=D.

D. |bibcode=1967Natur.215...45B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.

=== Auroras and the atmosphere ===
Auroras result from emissions of [[photon]]s in the Earth's upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], above {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}}, from [[ionized]] [[nitrogen]] atoms regaining an electron, and [[oxygen]] atoms and [[nitrogen]] based molecules returning from an [[excited state]] to [[ground state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ultraviolet Waves|url=http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127004149/http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html|archivedate=27 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere. Both incoming electrons and protons may be involved. Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:
;[[oxygen]] emissions: green or orange-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.
;[[nitrogen]] emissions: blue or red; blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.&lt;!-- atoms? not molecules? --&gt;
Oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take three quarters of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission. Because the highest atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually even green light emissions are prevented.
This is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/red, then finally nitrogen blue/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything. Green is the most common color. Then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.

===Auroras and the ionosphere===
Bright auroras are generally associated with [[Birkeland current]]s (Schield et al., 1969;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA074i001p00247 |last1=Schield |first1=M. A. |last2=Freeman |first2=J. W. |last3=Dessler |first3=A. J. |year=1969 |title=A Source for Field-Aligned Currents at Auroral Latitudes |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=247–256 |bibcode=1969JGR....74..247S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zmuda and Armstrong, 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA078i028p06802 |last1=Armstrong |first1=J. C. |last2=Zmuda |first2=A. J. |year=1973 |title=Triaxial magnetic measurements of field-aligned currents at 800 kilometers in the auroral region: Initial results |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=78 |issue=28 |pages=6802–6807 |bibcode=1973JGR....78.6802A}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which flow down into the ionosphere on one side of the pole and out on the other. In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125&amp;nbsp;km); the rest ("region 2") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the "partial ring current" carried by magnetically trapped plasma. The ionosphere is an [[Ohm's law|ohmic conductor]], so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms. In another interpretation the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.

Ionospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary [[Hall current]] flow. By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral [[electrojet]]. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity. [[Kristian Birkeland]]&lt;ref name="NAPE"&gt;{{cite book |last=Birkeland |first=Kristian |title=The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902–1903 |date=1908 |publisher=H. Aschehoug &amp; Co. |location=New York: Christiania (Oslo) |page=720 |url=https://archive.org/details/norwegianaurorap01chririch}} out-of-print, full text online&lt;/ref&gt; deduced that the currents flowed in the east–west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named "auroral electrojets" (see also [[Birkeland current]]s).

==Interaction of the solar wind with Earth==
The Earth is constantly immersed in the [[solar wind]], a rarefied flow of hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the Sun's outermost layer, the [[corona]]. The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400&amp;nbsp;km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT). During [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storms]], in particular, flows can be several times faster; the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) may also be much stronger. [[Joan Feynman]] deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19770051690|title=
On the high correlation between long-term averages of solar wind speed and geomagnetic activity|author1=Crooker, N. U. |author2=Feynman, J. |author3=Gosling, J. T. |date=1 May 1977|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her work resulted from data collected by the [[Explorer 33]] spacecraft.
The solar wind and magnetosphere consist of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It is well known (since [[Michael Faraday]]'s work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts ''across'' (or is cut ''by''), rather than ''along'', the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the ''direction'' of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. [[Dynamo]]s make use of this basic process ("the [[dynamo theory|dynamo effect]]"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.
The IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the [[sunspot]]s, and its [[magnetism|field lines (lines of force)]] are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the [[Eugene Parker|Parker spiral]]. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge ("limb") of the visible Sun at any time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html Alaska.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220050940/http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html |date=20 December 2006 }}, Solar wind forecast from a [[University of Alaska]] website&lt;/ref&gt;
The solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as [[magnetic reconnection]]. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the [[north magnetic pole]] and [[south magnetic pole]].

Auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when [[coronal mass ejections]] increase the intensity of the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905165404/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 September 2005 |title=NASA – NASA and World Book |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetosphere===
Earth's [[magnetosphere]] is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on the Earth's magnetic field. This forms an obstacle to the flow, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000&amp;nbsp;km (11 Earth radii or Re),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shue |first1=J.-H |first2=J.

The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth, is typically 190,000&amp;nbsp;km (30 Re), and on the night side a long "magnetotail" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (&gt; 200 Re).
The high latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyons |first1=L.

In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.
On 26 February 2008, [[THEMIS]] probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of [[magnetospheric substorm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html |title=NASA – THEMIS Satellites Discover What Triggers Eruptions of the Northern Lights |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043044/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html| archivedate= 29 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon, measured events suggesting a [[magnetic reconnection]] event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1160495 |title=Tail Reconnection Triggering Substorm Onset |year=2008 |last1=Angelopoulos |first1=V. |last2=McFadden |first2=J.

[[Geomagnetic storm]]s that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the [[equinox]]es. It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation, changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.

==Auroral particle acceleration==
The electrons responsible for the brightest forms of aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere. In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bryant |first1=Duncan |title=Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond |date=1998 |publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing Ltd |location=Bristol &amp; Philadelphia |isbn=978-0750305334 |url=https://www.crcpress.com/Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond/Bryant/9780750305334 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.
The increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector). This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionisation, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light. Acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.

One early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop.&lt;ref name="Evidence for the low altitude acceleration of auroral particles"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=D S |title=Hot Plasma in the Magnetosphere |date=1975 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York and London |isbn=978-0306337000 |pages=319–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; No mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equi-potential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible. Fundamentally, [[Poisson's equation]] indicates that there can be no configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop.  Inexplicably though, some authors&lt;ref&gt;Boström, Rolf "Observations of weak double layers on auroral field lines" (1992) IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science ({{ISSN|0093-3813}}), vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 756–763&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ergun, R. E., et al. "Parallel electric fields in the upward current region of the aurora: Indirect and direct observations" (2002) Physics of Plasmas, Volume 9, Issue 9, pp. 3685–3694&lt;/ref&gt; still invoke quasi-static parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons, citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact.  In another example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carlson |first1=C.W., R.F.Pfaff and J.G.Watzin |title=The Fast Auroral SnapshoT (FAST) mission |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |date=June 1998 |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=2013–2016|bibcode = 1998GeoRL..25.2013C |doi = 10.1029/98GL01592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is little justification given for saying 'FAST observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured electric potentials and the '''ion beam''' energies...., leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of '''auroral particle''' acceleration'.

Another theory is based on acceleration by Landau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Landau_Lev.html|website=history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |title=Lev Davidovich Landau}}&lt;/ref&gt; resonance in the turbulent electric fields of the acceleration region.

[[Image:Aurora Borealis.jpg|thumb|left|The aurora borealis as viewed from the International Space Station|ISS [[Expedition 6]] team, [[Lake Manicouagan]] is visible to the bottom left]]
Other mechanisms have also been proposed, in particular, [[Alfvén waves]], wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by [[Hannes Alfvén]] (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space. The question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.
{{Wikinews|Aurora Borealis caused by electrical space tornadoes}}
Other processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned. Auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 keV, and are stopped higher up, near 200&amp;nbsp;km. Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen, so that often such auroras are red. On the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20–30 keV, suggesting they might be an "overflow" along magnetic field lines of the copious "ring current" ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.
Some O+ ions ("conics") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora. These ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines. They therefore start at their "mirror points" and can travel only upward. As they do so, the "mirror effect" transforms their directions of motion, from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it, which gradually narrows down, becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker.

==Auroral events of historical significance==
The discovery of a 1770 Japanese [[diary]] in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient Japanese capital of [[Kyoto]] suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the [[Carrington event]], which affected telegraph networks.&lt;ref name="1770 Japanese diary"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/aurora-kyoto-1770-painting-science-magnetic-storm |title=1770 Kyoto Diary |last=Frost |first=Natasha |date=2017-10-04 |website=Atlas Obscura |access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm |journal=Space Weather |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1314–1320 |date=2017-09-17 |doi = 10.1002/2017SW001690|last1 = Kataoka|first1 = Ryuho|last2=Iwahashi |first2=Kiyomi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auroras that resulted from the "[[Solar storm of 1859|great geomagnetic storm]]" on both 28 August and 2 September 1859, however, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history. In a paper to the [[Royal Society]] on 21 November 1861, Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording [[magnetograph]] at the [[Kew Observatory]] and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Carrington]]-Hodgson flare event when he observed that, "It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken ''in the act''."&lt;ref name="BSp1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stewart |first=Balfour |jstor=111936 |title=On the Great Magnetic Disturbance of 28 August to 7 September 1859, as Recorded by Photography at the Kew Observatory |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=11 |date=1860–1862 |pages=407–10 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1860.0086}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense Carrington-Hodgson white light [[solar flare]] on 1 September 1859, produced auroras, so widespread and extraordinarily bright, that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia. It was reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that in [[Boston]] on Friday 2 September 1859 the aurora was "so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the [[light]]".&lt;ref name="ADVSR1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.asr.2005.12.021 |title=Eyewitness reports of the great auroral storm of 1859 |journal=Advances in Space Research |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=145–54 |last1=Green |first1=J |last2=Boardsen |first2=S |last3=Odenwald |first3=S |last4=Humble |first4=J |last5=Pazamickas |first5=K |bibcode=2006AdSpR..38..145G}}&lt;/ref&gt; One o'clock EST time on Friday 2 September, would have been 6:00 GMT and the self-recording [[magnetograph]] at the [[Kew Observatory]] was recording the [[geomagnetic storm]], which was then one hour old, at its full intensity. Between 1859 and 1862, [[Elias Loomis]] published a series of nine papers on the [[Elias Loomis#Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859|Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859]] in the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'' where he collected worldwide reports of the auroral event.

That aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense [[coronal mass ejection]]s in history. It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked. This insight was made possible not only due to scientific [[magnetometer]] measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the {{convert|125000|mi|km}} of [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm. Some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient [[geomagnetically induced current]] from the [[electromagnetic field]] to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off. The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between [[Boston]] and [[Portland, Maine]], on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the ''Boston Traveler'':

{{Quotation|'''Boston operator (to Portland operator):''' "Please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland operator:''' "Will do so. It is now disconnected."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?"&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland:''' "Better than with our batteries on. – Current comes and goes gradually."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland:''' "Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?"&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "Yes. Go ahead."}}

The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.&lt;ref name="ADVSR1" /&gt; Such events led to the general conclusion that

{{Quotation|The effect of the aurorae on the electric telegraph is generally to increase or diminish the electric current generated in working the wires. Sometimes it entirely neutralizes them, so that, in effect, no fluid is discoverable in them. The aurora borealis seems to be composed of a mass of electric matter, resembling in every respect, that generated by the electric galvanic battery. The currents from it change coming on the wires, and then disappear: the mass of the aurora rolls from the horizon to the zenith.&lt;ref&gt;''The British Colonist'', Vol. 2 No. 56, 19 October 1859, p. 1, accessed online at [http://britishcolonist.ca/display.php?issue=18591019&amp;pages=001,&amp;terms=aurora BritishColonist.ca]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831112729/http://britishcolonist.ca/display.php?issue=18591019&amp;pages=001%2C&amp;terms=aurora |date=31 August 2009 }}, on 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical theories, superstition and mythology==
An aurora was described by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[explorer]] [[Pytheas]] in the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Macleod, ''Explorers: Great Tales of Adventure and Endurance'', p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] wrote about auroras in the first book of his ''[[Naturales Quaestiones]]'', classifying them, for instance as ''pithaei'' ('barrel-like'); ''chasmata'' ('chasm'); ''pogoniae'' ('bearded'); ''cyparissae'' ('like [[cypress]] trees'), and describing their manifold colors. He wrote about whether they were above or below the [[clouds]], and recalled that under [[Tiberius]], an aurora formed above the port city of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army, stationed nearby for fire duty, galloped to the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, J.,[https://archive.org/stream/physicalsciencei00seneiala#page/38/mode/2up ''Physical Science in the time of Nero''] p.39-41, London, Macmillan, (1910), accessed online on 1 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that [[Pliny the Elder]] depicted the aurora borealis in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', when he refers to ''trabes'', ''chasma'', 'falling red flames' and 'daylight in the night'.&lt;ref&gt;Bostock, J. and Riley, H.T., ''The Natural History of Pliny: Volume II'', London, Bohn (1855), accessed online at [https://archive.org/stream/naturalhistoryof11855plin#page/62/mode/2up/search/aurora], on 1 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aurora australis.jpg|thumb|The Aboriginal Australians associated auroras (which are mainly low on the horizon and predominantly red) with fire.]]
In the traditions of [[Aboriginal Australians]], the Aurora Australis is commonly associated with fire. For example, the [[Gunditjmara people]] of western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] called auroras ''puae buae'' ('ashes'), while the [[Gunai people]] of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as [[Wildfire|bushfires]] in the spirit world. The [[Diyari|Dieri]] people of [[South Australia]] say that an auroral display is ''kootchee'', an evil spirit creating a large fire. Similarly, the [[Ngarrindjeri|Ngarrindjeri people]] of South Australia refer to auroras seen over [[Kangaroo Island]] as the campfires of spirits in the 'Land of the Dead'. Aboriginal people in southwest [[Queensland]] believe the auroras to be the fires of the ''Oola Pikka'', ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras. Sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamacher |first=D.W. |title=Aurorae in Australian Aboriginal Traditions |journal=Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage |year=2013 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=207–219 |url=http://www.narit.or.th/en/files/2013JAHHvol16/2013JAHH...16..207H.pdf |arxiv=1309.3367 |bibcode=2013JAHH...16..207H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bulfinch's Mythology]]'' relates that in [[Norse mythology]], the armour of the [[Valkyrie|Valkyrior]] "sheds a strange flickering light, which flashes up over the northern skies, making what Men call the 'aurora borealis', or 'Northern Lights' ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mythome.org/bxxxviii.html |title=Bullfinch's Mythology |publisher=Mythome.org |date=10 February 1996 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214105537/http://www.mythome.org/bxxxviii.html |archivedate=14 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be no evidence in [[Old Norse literature]] to substantiate this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/njordrljos.htm |title=The Aurora Borealis and the Vikings |publisher=Vikinganswerlady.com |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Old Norse account of ''norðrljós'' is found in the Norwegian chronicle ''[[Konungs Skuggsjá]]'' from AD 1230. The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from [[Greenland]], and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires; that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side; or that [[glacier]]s could store energy so that they eventually became [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irf.se/norrsken/Norrsken_history.html |title=Norrsken history |publisher=Irf.se |date=12 November 2003 |accessdate=26 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721215920/http://www.irf.se/norrsken/Norrsken_history.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1740s [[Benjamin Franklin]] theorized in his paper ''Aurora Borealis, Suppositions and Conjectures towards forming an Hypothesis for its Explanation'' that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air:&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N. (ed.)

Observations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the Swedish city of [[Uppsala]] by [[Anders Celsius]] and [[Olof Hiorter]]. In 1741, Hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuations with an aurora being observed overhead. This evidence helped to support their theory that 'magnetic storms' are responsible for such compass fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;J. Oschman (2016), ''Energy Medicine: The Scientific Basis'' (Elsevier, Edinburgh) p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] myths surround the spectacle. The European explorer [[Samuel Hearne]] traveled with [[Chipewyan|Chipewyan Dene]] in 1771 and recorded their views on the ''ed-thin'' ('caribou'). According to Hearne, the Dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when [[caribou]] fur is stroked. They believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.&lt;ref&gt;Hearne, Samuel (1958). ''A Journey to the Northern Ocean: A journey from Prince of Wales' Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean in the years 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772''. Richard Glover (ed.). Toronto: The MacMillan Company of Canada. pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night after the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The [[Confederate Army]] took this as a sign that God was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south. The painting ''[[Aurora Borealis (painting)|Aurora Borealis]]'' by [[Frederic Edwin Church]] is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=4806|title=''Aurora Borealis'' at the American Art Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid 19th-century British source says auroras were a rare occurrence before the 18th-century.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.II'', (1847), London, Charles Knight, p.496&lt;/ref&gt; It quotes [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] as saying that before the aurora of 1716, no such phenomenon had been recorded for more than 80 years, and none of any consequence since 1574. It says no appearance is recorded in the [[French Academy of Sciences|''Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences'']] between 1666 and 1716. And that one aurora recorded in ''Berlin Miscellany'' for 1797 was called a very rare event. One observed in 1723 at [[Bologna]] was stated to be the first ever seen there. [[Anders Celsius|Celsius]] (1733) states the oldest residents of [[Uppsala]] thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. The period between approximately 1645 to 1715 corresponds to the [[Maunder minimum]] in sunspot activity.

It was the Norwegian scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] who, in the early 1900s, laid the foundation for our current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras.

==Non-terrestrial auroras==

{{see also|Magnetosphere of Jupiter#Aurorae}}
Both [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] have magnetic fields that are stronger than Earth's (Jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts. Auroras have been observed on both gas planets, most clearly using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], as well as on [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name="esa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMLQ71DU8E_index_0.html |title=ESA Portal – Mars Express discovers auroras on Mars |publisher=Esa.int |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auroras on the gas giants seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind. In addition, however, Jupiter's moons, especially [[Io (moon)|Io]], are powerful sources of auroras on Jupiter. These arise from electric currents along field lines ("field aligned currents"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active [[volcanism]] and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, auroras over Io, Europa and Ganymede have all been observed.

Auroras have also been observed on [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Venus has no magnetic field and so Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet. A Venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere.

An aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard [[Mars Express]]. The aurora was located at [[Terra Cimmeria]], in the region of 177° East, 52° South. The total size of the emission region was about 30&amp;nbsp;km across, and possibly about 8&amp;nbsp;km high. By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from [[Mars Global Surveyor]], scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.&lt;ref name="esa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=18 February 2006 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/mars_express_aurorae.html?1722006 |title=Mars Express Finds Auroras on Mars |publisher=Universe Today |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ever [[Extra-solar object|extra-solar]] auroras were discovered in July 2015 over the [[brown dwarf]] star [[LSR J1835+3259]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/monstrous-aurora-detected-beyond-our-solar-system-150729.htm |title=Monstrous Aurora Detected Beyond our Solar System |last1=O'Neill |first1=Ian |date=29 July 2015 |website=news.discovery.com |publisher=Discovery |access-date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/30087-alien-auroras-found-beyond-solar-system.html |title=First Alien Auroras Found, Are 1 Million Times Brighter Than Any On Earth |last1=Q.

==History==
Bangladesh National Nutrition Council was established in 1975 on the orders of the [[President of Bangladesh]]. Since 1998 the council observes National Nutrition Week every year at national, district, and upazila level. The council publishes a journal twice every year called the South Asian Journal of Nutrition. The council also helps plan nutritional nutrient programs for relevant seventeen ministries.&lt;ref name="nnv"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mahmud|first1=Iffat|last2=Mbuya|first2=Nkosinathi|title=Water, Sanitation, Hygiene, and Nutrition in Bangladesh: Can Building Toilets Affect Children's Growth?|date=2015|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=9781464806995|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlz1CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Bangladesh+National+Nutrition+Council&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SaoRQ1IYK9&amp;sig=e3lcptxCj6gO99S3LjSU7IEwWIA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKho3S_orYAhUJkeAKHZKmBSgQ6AEIlQEwFw#v=onepage&amp;q=Bangladesh%20National%20Nutrition%20Council&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 with the help of the World Bank it carried out a national nutritional survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Per head daily intake declined by 250 calories in 32 yrs|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news/per-head-daily-intake-declined-by-250-calories-in-32-yrs|accessdate=15 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=1 August 1997|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10605">A '''cell bank''' is a facility that stores cells of specific [[genome]] for the purpose of future use in a product or medicinal needs. They often contain expansive amounts of [[Cellular material|base cell material]] that can be utilized for various projects. Cell banks can be used to generate detailed characterizations of cell lines and can also help mitigate [[Cell culture#Cell line cross-contamination|cross-contamination]] of a [[cell line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Novel vaccination strategies |last=Kaufmann |first=Stefan H.E. |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]] |location= |isbn= |page=283 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eH950PyUQYC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=%22cell+bank%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8LNETqSkFMnd0QH4g7SOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cell%20bank%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing cell banks also reduces the cost of cell culture processes, providing a cost-efficient alternative to keeping cells in culture constantly. Cell banks are commonly used within fields including stem cell research and pharmaceuticals, with [[cryopreservation]] being the traditional method of keeping cellular material intact.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harel|first=Adrian|date=2013-02-13|title=Cryopreservation and Cell Banking for Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Based Therapies|url=http://la-press.com/cryopreservation-and-cell-banking-for-autologous-mesenchymal-stem-cell-article-a3541|journal=Cell &amp; Tissue Transplantation &amp; Therapy|language=en|volume=2013|issue=5|doi=10.4137/CTTT.S11249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell banks also effectively reduce the frequency of a cell sample diversifying from natural cell divisions over time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atcc.org/~/media/PDFs/Technical%20Bulletins/tb03.ashx "Cryogenic Storage of Animal Cells"]. 2010. Retrieved March 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage ==
Before putting the donated cell lines into storage, they are first [[Cell proliferation|proliferated]] and multiplied into a large number of identical cells before being stored in a number of [[Vial|cryovials]].  Along with the cells, cryoprotection agents are also added to the vials to protect the cells from rupturing from ice crystals during the freezing process. 10% DMSO solution is a common cryoprotection agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Rosa|first=Alfredo|last2=De Francesco|first2=Francesco|last3=Tirino|first3=Virginia|last4=Ferraro|first4=Giuseppe A.|last5=Desiderio|first5=Vincenzo|last6=Paino|first6=Francesca|last7=Pirozzi|first7=Giuseppe|last8=D'Andrea|first8=Francesco|last9=Papaccio|first9=Gianpaolo|date=2009-03-02|title=A New Method for Cryopreserving Adipose-Derived Stem Cells: An Attractive and Suitable Large-Scale and Long-Term Cell Banking Technology|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ten.tec.2008.0674|journal=Tissue Engineering Part C: Methods|volume=15|issue=4|pages=659–667|doi=10.1089/ten.tec.2008.0674|issn=1937-3384}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cryovials are then placed into a tray, labeled with the cell line's genetic data, and placed into cryogenic freezers. The freezers contain nitrogen in either liquid or vapor form, and the cells are frozen at a rate of -1 to -3 degrees Celsius per minute until a temperature of -196 degrees Celsius is reached.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Behme"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiUBBra9ebUC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22cell+bank%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8LNETqSkFMnd0QH4g7SOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cell%20bank%22&amp;f=false|title=Manufacturing of pharmaceutical proteins: from technology to economy|last=Behme|first=Stefan|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=|page=|pages=46–47|authorlink=|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a temperature of -196 degrees Celsius, metabolic processes within the cells are significantly slowed to stop all cell growth, thus preserving the cell line, which is especially useful when the cell line has a limited number of cell divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cell Banking (MCB, WCB, Cryopreservation)|first1=Alex|last1=Fanelli|url=http://www.cellbanking.net/frequently-asked-questions/|access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells can be stored for an extended amount of time in this state, reducing the rate of degradation of cellular material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Freezing==
The general freezing process for mammalian cells involves suspending a small density of the cells of interest in a solution of cryopreservation agents in a cryovial and freezing the cells to a temperature of -196 degrees Celsius. A slow freezing rate is important to maintaining the health of the cell culture. Freezing the cells at a rate of -1 to -3 degrees Celsius per minute is generally acceptable in maintaining cell culture health.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;7.1-7.4." Fundamental Techniques in Cell Culture Laboratory Handbook – 2nd Edition. N.p.: Health Protection Agency, n.d. 20-23''. Public Health England.'' Web. 24 Jan. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Freezing too quickly risks damaging the cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cryopreservation: Technologies, Applications and Risks/Outcomes|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/17981/3/Coopman%20final%20with%20refs.pdf|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|pages=91-108|last1=Coopman|first1=K|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a freezing rate of -5 degrees Celsius per minute, significant decreases of the thawed cell culture is observed. Even more pronounced decreases in cell culture health is observed at faster freezing rates, to the point that the cell culture cannot maintain a cell density.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thirumala|first=Sreedhar|last2=Goebel|first2=W. Scott|last3=Woods|first3=Erik J.|date=2013-05-01|title=Manufacturing and banking of mesenchymal stem cells|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1517/14712598.2013.763925|journal=Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy|volume=13|issue=5|pages=673–691|doi=10.1517/14712598.2013.763925|issn=1471-2598|pmid=23339745}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cryopreservation agents is also key to the freezing process. A common cryoprotection agent used is 10% solution of DMSO, which acts to protect the cells from the rupturing caused by ice crystals during freezing and during thawing. DMSO has been observed agent to be toxic to cells, and requires dilution after the cells are thawed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Thawing==
Rapid thaws are recommend in bringing the cells out of cryopreservation and starting up their normal metabolic processes. Minimizing the exposure of the cryovial and its contents to room, or ambient temperatures is important. Rapid thaws are important to prevent the contents of the vial from melting and refreezing rapidly, which could cause ice crystals to form rupture the cells in the vial. Thaws can be performed in a few minutes within a water bath at a temperature around 37&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Experimentation has shown that a slower thaw in a controlled environment such as an incubator can be also be used to safely thaw cryofrozen cells.Thawing in an incubator avoids the risk of contamination involved in thawing in a water bath, however takes a significantly longer amount of time and resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Post thaw, the cells need to be transferred from the cryovial into another vessel and resuspended in media. By diluting the concentration of the cryoprotection agent present, negative effects such as toxicity from the cryprotection agents on metabolically active cells can be mitigated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
Originally, scientists kept collections of cellular material for their own use, but not for the scientific community at large. The first person accredited with making a cell bank for widespread use was Kral, a [[Czechoslovakian]] scientist who created his cell bank collection in the late 1890s.&lt;ref name="Hug"&gt;{{cite book |title=Translational Stem Cell Research: Issues Beyond the Debate on the Moral Status of the Human Embryo |last=Hug |first=Kristina |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=225–237 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=955hap0emMUC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22cell+bank%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ggdLTqqoNar-sQKYsNSJDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cell%20bank%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are a large number of "culture collections and bioresource centers" that serve an individual part of the process of [[bioengineering]]. Some examples of these include the [[World Federation for Culture Collections]] and the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories.&lt;ref name="Hug"/&gt; In January 2003, the [[UK Stem Cell Bank]] was established to serve as a central unit for specimen collection and human testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stem Cell Wars: Inside Stories from the Frontlines |last=Herold |first=Eve |authorlink= |author2=Daley, George |year=2007 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location= |isbn= |page=205 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBQgMTqIseQC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22stem+cell+bank%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IzRLTsSTDqKqsALH76i3CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22stem%20cell%20bank%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Stem Cell Bank was established in October 2005 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in order to serve as a repository specifically for stem cell lines. It currently hosts 13 of the 21 stem cell lines that exist in the world and are listed on the Stem Cell Registry hosted by the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of stem cell research, Volume 2 |last=Svendsen |first=Clive |authorlink= |author2=Ebert, Allison D. |year=2008 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=369–370 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UhvtbMmxXeAC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=%22stem+cell+bank%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IzRLTsSTDqKqsALH76i3CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22stem%20cell%20bank%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the [[World Health Organization]] established a reference cell bank to provide a resource for the development of vaccines and other biological medicines. Another reference cell bank was established by the World Health Organization in 2007 as a result of stability issues with [[MRC-5]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/WHO_reference_cell_banks/en/|title=WHO {{!}} WHO Reference Cell Banks (RCBs)|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2250">In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], '''computable analysis''' is the study of [[mathematical analysis]] from the perspective of [[computability theory]]. It is concerned with the parts of [[real analysis]] and [[functional analysis]] that can be carried out in a [[computability theory|computable]] manner.  The field is closely related to [[constructive analysis]] and [[numerical analysis]].
==Basic constructions==
===Computable real numbers===
{{main|Computable number}}
[[Computable numbers]] are the [[real numbers]] that can be computed to within any desired precision by a finite, terminating [[algorithm]]. They are also known as the '''recursive numbers''' or the '''computable reals'''.
===Computable real functions===
{{main|Computable real function}}
A [[function (mathematics)|function]]  &lt;math&gt;f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is ''sequentially computable'' if, for every computable [[sequence]]  &lt;math&gt;\{x_i\}_{i=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; of [[real number]]s, the sequence &lt;math&gt;\{f(x_i) \}_{i=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is also [[computable real number|computable]]. 
== Basic results ==
The [[computable real number]]s form a [[real closed field]] (Weihrauch 2000, p. 180).  The [[equality (mathematics)|equality relation]] on computable real numbers is not computable, but for unequal computable real numbers the [[order relation]] is computable.

[[Computable real function]]s map computable real numbers to computable real numbers. The [[function composition|composition]] of computable real functions is again computable. Every computable real function is [[continuous function|continuous]] (Weihrauch 2000, p. 6).

[[File:AR1520 and Shimmering Coronal Loops.ogv|thumb|Coronal loops.]]
[[File:Gradient Sun.ogv|thumb|Watch this movie to see how coronal loops on the Sun next to the more fuzzy areas in the lower solar atmosphere provide a dazzling show.]]

[[File:4k video of the Sun's surface activity.ogv|thumb|This 4k video allows us a high-definition look at the complexity of activity occurring on the surface our parent star, the Sun. Coronal loops — linking areas of opposite magnetic polarity in the photosphere — enormous solar prominences and sunspots are all to be seen here.]]

'''Coronal loops''' form the basic structure of the lower [[corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]] of the [[Sun]]. These highly structured loops are a direct consequence of the twisted solar [[magnetic flux]] within the solar body. The population of coronal loops can be directly linked with the [[solar cycle]]; it is for this reason coronal loops are often found with [[sunspots]] at their footpoints. The upwelling magnetic flux pushes through the [[photosphere]], exposing a cooler plasma in footpoints. This plasma is cooler because of the magnetic field radially directed which stop the convective process in these regions. Then heat can't be transported toward the surface by convection, and the contrast between the photosphere and this cooler plasma gives the impression of dark spots, or sunspots.

==Physical features==
[[Image:Twistedflux.png|thumb|A diagram showing the evolution of the solar magnetic flux over one solar cycle.]]
[[Image:Cartoonloops.png|thumb|Diagram of the low [[corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]], where many scales of coronal loops can be observed.]]

A coronal loop is magnetic [[flux]] fixed at both ends, threading through the solar body, protruding into the solar atmosphere. They are ideal structures to observe when trying to understand the transfer of energy from the solar body, through the transition region and into the corona.

Many scales of coronal loops exist, neighbouring open flux tubes that give way to the [[solar wind]] and reach far into the corona and heliosphere. Anchored in the photosphere (a rigid, [[magnetohydrodynamics|line-tied]], anchor is assumed where the high-β, external plasma holds the loop footpoints in place), coronal loops project through the [[chromosphere]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]], extending high into the [[corona]].

Also, coronal loops have a wide variety of temperatures along their lengths. Loops existing at temperatures below 1&amp;nbsp;MK are generally known as cool loops, those existing at around 1&amp;nbsp;MK are known as warm loops, and those beyond 1&amp;nbsp;MK are known as hot loops. Naturally, these different categories radiate at different wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Location===
Coronal loops populate both active and quiet regions of the solar surface. Active regions on the solar surface take up small areas but produce the majority of activity and are often the source of flares and [[Coronal Mass Ejection]]s due to the [[Magnetic reconnection|intense magnetic field]] present. Active regions produce 82% of the total coronal heating energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The quiet Sun makes up the rest of the solar surface. The quiet Sun, although less active than active regions, is awash with [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] processes and [[transient astronomical event|transient]] events (bright points, [[nanoflares]] and jets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule, the quiet Sun exists in regions of closed magnetic structures, and active regions are highly dynamic sources of explosive events. It is important to note that observations suggest the whole corona is massively populated by open and closed magnetic fieldlines.

===Coronal loops and the coronal heating problem===
[[Image:Energyfig.png|thumb|A modelled example of a quiescent coronal loop (energy contributions).]]

A closed fieldline does not constitute a coronal loop; however, closed flux must be ''filled with plasma'' before it can be called a coronal loop. With this in mind, it becomes clear that coronal loops are a rarity on the solar surface, as the majority of closed-flux structures are empty. This means the mechanism that heats the corona and injects chromospheric plasma into the closed magnetic flux is highly localised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi = 10.1086/172927
| bibcode=1993ApJ...412..375L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism behind plasma filling, dynamic flows and coronal heating remains a mystery. The mechanism(s) must be stable enough to continue to feed the corona with chromospheric plasma and powerful enough to accelerate and therefore heat the plasma from 6000&amp;nbsp;K to well over 1&amp;nbsp;MK over the short distance from the chromosphere and transition region to the corona. This is the very reason coronal loops are targeted for intense study. They are anchored to the photosphere, are fed by chromospheric plasma, protrude into the transition region and exist at coronal temperatures after undergoing intensive heating.

The idea that the coronal heating problem is solely down to some coronal heating mechanism is misleading. Firstly, the plasma filling over-dense loops is drained directly from the chromosphere. There is no coronal mechanism known that can compress coronal plasma and feed it into coronal loops at coronal altitudes. Secondly, observations of coronal upflows point to a chromospheric source of plasma. The plasma is therefore chromospheric in origin; there must be consideration of this when looking into coronal heating mechanisms. This is a ''chromospheric energization'' and ''coronal heating phenomenon'' possibly linked through a common mechanism.

==History of observations==

===1946–1975===
Many strides have been made by ground-based telescopes (such as the [[Mauna Loa Solar Observatory]], MLSO, in [[Hawaii]]) and [[eclipse]] observations of the corona, but to escape the obscuring effect of the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere, space-based observations have become a necessary evolution for solar physics. Beginning with the short (seven-minute) [[Aerobee (rocket)|Aerobee]] rocket flights in 1946 and 1952, [[spectrogram]]s measured solar EUV and [[Lyman alpha|Lyman-α]] emissions. Basic [[X-ray]] observations were attained by 1960 using such rockets. The [[Skylark (rocket)|British Skylark rocket]] missions from 1959 to 1978 also returned mainly X-ray [[spectrometer]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

During the period of 1962–1975, the satellite series [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] (OSO-1 to OSO-8) were able to gain extended EUV and X-ray spectrometer observations. Then, in 1973, [[Skylab]] was launched and began a new multi-wavelength campaign that typified future observatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A wealth of data was accumulated across the whole range of emission.

===1991–present day===
[[Image:Tracemosaic.jpg|thumb|Full-disk mosaic of the million-degree [[Sun]] by [[TRACE]].]]

The solar community was rocked by the launch of ''[[Yohkoh]]'' (Solar A) from [[Kagoshima Space Centre]] in August 1991. It was lost on 14 December 2001 due to battery failure but revolutionised X-ray observations in its decade of operations. ''Yohkoh'' (or ''Sunbeam'') orbited the Earth in an [[elliptical]] [[orbit]], observing X-ray and [[Gamma ray|γ-ray]] emissions from solar phenomena such as solar flares. ''Yohkoh'' carried four instruments. The Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS), the Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS), the Soft X-Ray Telescope ([[Yohkoh|SXT]]) and the Hard X-Ray Telescope (HXT) were operated by a consortium of scientists from Japan, the USA and the UK. Of particular interest is the [[Yohkoh|SXT]] instrument for observing X-ray-emitting coronal loops.

The SXT instrument observed X-rays in the 0.25–4.0&amp;nbsp;[[SI units|keV]] range, resolving solar features to 2.5 arc seconds with a temporal resolution of 0.5–2 seconds. SXT was sensitive to plasma in the 2–4&amp;nbsp;MK temperature range, making it an ideal observational platform to compare with data collected from [[TRACE]] coronal loops radiating in the EUV wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | volume = 188
  | pages = 1–9
  | year = 2002
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major step in solar physics came at the launch of the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) in December 1995 from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in [[Florida]], USA. SOHO originally had an operational lifetime of two years. The mission was extended to March 2007 due to its resounding success, allowing SOHO to observe a complete 11-year solar cycle. SOHO continually faces the Sun holding a slow orbit around the First [[Lagrangian Point]] (L1), where the gravitational balance between the Sun and Earth provides a stable position for SOHO to orbit. SOHO is continually eclipsing the Sun from the Earth at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometres.

SOHO is managed by scientists from the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and NASA. Containing more instruments than both TRACE and Yohkoh, this large solar mission was designed to look at the chain from the solar interior, the solar corona to the solar wind. SOHO has 12 instruments on board, including the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS), the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT), the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) and the UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS), which are all used extensively in the study of the transition region and corona.

The EIT instrument is used extensively in coronal loop observations. EIT images the transition region through to the inner corona by utilising four band passes, 171&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeIX, 195&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXII, 284&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXV and 304&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;HeII, each corresponding to different EUV temperatures, probing the [[chromospheric network]] to the lower corona.

The [[TRACE|Transition Region And Coronal Explorer]] ([[TRACE]]) was launched in April 1998 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] as part of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Small Explorer (SMEX) project. The small orbiting instrument has a 30×160&amp;nbsp;cm, 8.66&amp;nbsp;m focal length Cassegrain telescope with a 1200×1200px CCD detector. The timing of the launch was planned to coincide with the rising phase of the solar maximum. Observations of the transition region and lower corona could then be carried out in conjunction with SOHO to give an unprecedented view of the solar environment during this exciting phase of the solar cycle.

Due to the high spatial (1 arc second) and temporal resolution (1–5 seconds), TRACE has been able to capture highly detailed images of coronal structures, whilst SOHO provides the global (lower resolution) picture of the Sun. This campaign demonstrates the observatory's ability to track the evolution of steady-state (or [[wikt:quiescent|quiescent]]) coronal loops. TRACE utilizes filters that are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in the 171&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeIX, 195&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXII, 284&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;FeXV, 1216&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;HI, 1550&amp;nbsp;Å&amp;nbsp;CIV and 1600&amp;nbsp;Å range. Of particular interest are the 171&amp;nbsp;Å, 195&amp;nbsp;Å and 284&amp;nbsp;Å band passes, as they are sensitive to the radiation emitted by quiescent coronal loops.

==Dynamic flows==
[[Image:SOLAR-B artists concept.jpg|thumb|The new solar observatory ''[[Hinode]]'' (Solar-B), launched September 2006, will observe the magnetic structure of the corona.]]

All of the above space missions have been highly successful in observing strong plasma flows and highly dynamic processes in coronal loops. For example, SUMER observations suggest flow velocities of 5–16&amp;nbsp;km/s in the solar disk, and other
joint SUMER/TRACE observations detect flows of 15–40&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Hen chicken.jpg|thumb|An adult bird which has been beak-trimmed as a chick]]
'''Debeaking''' is the partial removal of the [[beak]] of [[poultry]], especially [[chicken|layer hens]] and [[domesticated turkey|turkeys]] although it may also be performed on [[quail]] and [[ducks]]. Most commonly, the beak is shortened permanently, although regrowth can occur. The trimmed lower beak is somewhat longer than the upper beak.

Beak trimming is most common in egg-laying strains of chickens.  In some countries, such as the United States, turkeys routinely have their beaks trimmed. In the UK, only 10% of turkeys are beak trimmed.&lt;ref name="FAWC turkeys"&gt;[http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports/turkeys/turkr025.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Beak trimming is a preventive measure to reduce damage caused by injurious pecking such as [[Cannibalism in poultry|cannibalism]], [[feather pecking]] and [[vent pecking]], and thereby improve livability.&lt;ref name="Hester and Shea-Moore, (2003)" /&gt;  Commercial broiler chickens are not routinely beak trimmed as they reach slaughter weight at approximately 6 weeks of age, i.e. before injurious pecking usually begins.  However, broiler breeding stock may be trimmed to prevent damage during mating.&lt;ref name="Gentle and McKeegan, (2007)"&gt;Gentle, M.J. and McKeegan, D.E.F., (2007). Evaluation of the effects of infrared beak trimming in broiler breeder chicks. Veterinary Record, 160: 145–148&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries, beak trimming is done as a last resort where alternatives are considered not to be possible or appropriate.

Opponents of beak trimming state that the practice reduces problem pecking by minor amounts compared to the trauma, injury, and harm done to the entire flock by beak trimming. Reduction is in single digit percentiles, whereas improvement of conditions especially in layer colonies will cease problematic behavior entirely.&lt;ref name="niedr" /&gt;{{dubious|date=May 2017}}{{better citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Beak trimming has been banned in Switzerland since 1992 and has been phased out in Germany in 2017.&lt;ref name="niedr"&gt;[http://www.ml.niedersachsen.de/portal/live.php?navigation_id=1810&amp;article_id=126928&amp;_psmand=7 Ab 2017 bleibt der Schnabel jetzt bundesweit dran!]&lt;/ref&gt;

In close confinement, [[Cannibalism in poultry|cannibalism]], feather pecking and aggression are common among turkeys, [[duck]]s, [[pheasant]]s, [[quail]], and chickens of many breeds (including both heritage breeds and modern [[Sex link|hybrids]]) kept for eggs. The tendency to cannibalism and feather pecking varies among different strains of chickens, but does not manifest itself consistently. Some flocks of the same breed may be entirely free from cannibalism, while others, under the same management, may have a serious outbreak.  Mortalities, mainly due to cannibalism, can be up to 15% in egg laying flocks housed in aviaries,&lt;ref name="Hill, (1986)"&gt;Hill, J.A., (1986).

Because egg laying strains of chickens can be kept in smaller group sizes in caged systems, cannibalism is reduced&lt;ref name="Appleby and Hughes, (1991)"&gt;Appleby, M.C. and Hughes B.O., (1991). Welfare of laying hens in cages and alternative systems: Environmental, physical and behavioural aspects.

Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica Section A-Animal Science,  45: 191-203&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a lowered trend in mortality as compared to non-cage systems.  Cannibalism among flocks is highly variable and when it is not problematic, then mortalities among production systems are similar.&lt;ref name="Appleby and Hughes, (1991)" /&gt;

== History ==
Beak trimming was developed at the Ohio Experiment Station in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Kennard, (1937)"&gt;Kennard, D.C. (1937). ''Chicken Vices''. 184. Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station. 22: 33-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original technique was temporary, cutting approximately 6&amp;nbsp;mm (1/4 inch) off the beak. It was thought that the tip of the beak had no blood supply and presumably no sensation. The procedure was performed by hand with a sharp knife, either when deaths due to cannibalism became excessive, or when the problem was anticipated because of a history of cannibalism in the particular strain of chicken.

Cannibalism is a serious management problem dating back to the periods before intensive housing of poultry became popular. Poultry books written before [[corporate farming|vertical integration of the poultry industry]] describe the abnormal pecking of poultry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chicks and adult birds' picking at each other until blood shows and then destroying one another by further picking is a source of great loss in many flocks, especially when kept in confinement .... The recommendation of the Ohio Experiment Station of cutting back the tip of the upper beak has been found to be effective until the beak grows out again.&lt;ref name="Jull, (1938)"&gt;Jull, M.A., (1938). ''Poultry Husbandry'', 2nd Edition. McGraw Hill, New York., page 346.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cannibalism has two peaks in the life of a chicken; during the brooding period and at the onset of egg laying. The point-of-lay cannibalism is generally the most damaging and gets most of the attention. The temporary beak trimming developed at the Ohio Experiment Station assumed that cannibalism was a phase, and that blunting the beak temporarily would be adequate.

===Current methods and guidelines===
In recent years, the aim has been to develop more permanent beak trimming (although repeat trimming may be required), using  electrically heated blades in a beak trimming machine, to provide a self-cauterizing cut.  There are currently (2012) four widely used methods of beak trimming: hot blade, cold blade (including [[scissors]] or [[secateurs]]), electrical (the Bio-beaker) and [[infrared]].  The latter two methods usually remove only the tip of the beak and do not leave an open wound, therefore they may offer improvements in welfare. Other approaches such as the use of lasers, freeze drying and chemical retardation have been investigated but are not in widespread use.&lt;ref name="AVMA2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/LiteratureReviews/Documents/beak_trimming_bgnd.pdf|title=AVMA Literature review on the welfare implications of beaktrimming|year=2010|author=AVMA|accessdate=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The infrared method directs a strong source of heat into the inner tissue of the beak and after a few weeks, the tip of the upper and lower beak dies and drops off making the beak shorter with blunt tips.  The Bio-beaker, which uses an electric current to burn a small hole in the upper beak, is the preferred method for trimming the beaks of turkeys.&lt;ref name="Glatz, (2005)"&gt;Glatz, P.C., (2005). ''Poultry Welfare Issues: Beak Trimming.'' Nottingham University Press, Nottingham, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) wrote regarding beak trimming of turkeys that cold cutting was the most accurate method, but that substantial re-growth of the beak occurred; although the Bio-beaker limited beak re-growth, it was less accurate.  It was considered that the hot cut was the most distressing procedure for turkeys.&lt;ref name="FAWC turkeys"/&gt;

In the UK, beak trimming of layer hens normally occurs at 1-day of age at the same time as the chick is being sexed and vaccinated.

USA's [[United Egg Producers|UEP]] guidelines suggest that in egg laying strains of chickens, the length of the upper beak distal from the nostrils that remains following trimming, should be 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;United Egg Producers Animal Husbandry Guidelines for U.S. Egg Laying Flocks, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK, the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] stated: "The accepted procedure is to remove not more than one third of the upper and lower beaks or not more than one third of the upper beak only" but went on to recommend: "Where beak trimming is carried out, it should, wherever possible, be restricted to beak tipping; that is the blunting of the beak to remove the sharp point which can be the cause of the most severe damage to other birds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fawc.org.uk/pdf/beak-trimming.pdf|title=FAWC opinion on beak trimming, 2007|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}

===Australia===
Beak trimming is banned in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. It is currently debated in parliament whether debeaking should be banned in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal law in the spotlight: Victoria's factory farming bill|url=https://www.voiceless.org.au/content/animal-law-spotlight-victorias-factory-farming-bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal law in the spotlight: NSW battery hen bill|url=https://www.voiceless.org.au/content/animal-law-spotlight-nsw-battery-hen-bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
Beak trimming was used in Denmark until 2014 when it was phased out and made illegal.&lt;ref name="Status of beak trimming in EU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Status of beak trimming in EU|url= http://www.lf.dk/~/media/lf/for-medlemmer/sektioner-og-udvalg/erhvervsfjerkraesektionen/kongres-2016/ana%C3%ABlle-laravoire.pdf?la=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden, Finland and Norway===
Beak trimming is illegal in these countries.&lt;ref name="Status of beak trimming in EU"/&gt;

===Germany===
Agriculture Minister [[Christian Meyer (politician)|Christian Meyer]] announced that Germany would phase out beak trimming by 2017 due to animal welfare concerns.&lt;ref name="niedr"/&gt;

==Costs and benefits==

===Costs===
The costs of beak trimming relate primarily to welfare concerns.  These include acute stress, and acute, possibly chronic, [[pain]] following trimming. A bird’s ability to consume food is impaired following beak trimming because of the new beak shape and pain.  Most studies report reduced body weights and feed intake following beak trimming, however, by sexual maturity or peak egg production, growth rates are usually normal.&lt;ref name="Hester and Shea-Moore, (2003)"&gt;Hester, P.Y. and Shea-Moore, M., (2003). Beak trimming egg-laying strains of chickens. World’s Poultry Science Journal, 59: 458-474&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gustafson et al., (2007)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lagana et al., (2011)" /&gt;  Weight losses were reduced in chicks that were beak trimmed by infrared compared with chicks trimmed by a hot-blade.&lt;ref name="Marchant-Forde and Cheng, (2011)"&gt;Marchant-Forde, R.M. and Cheng, H.W., (2011).

Whether beak trimming causes pain is a hotly debated concern.  It is a complex issue as it may involve acute and/or chronic pain, and depends on the age it is performed, the method of trimming and the length of beak that is removed.
Beak trimming in the poultry industry usually occurs without [[anaesthetic]] at 1-day of age or when the chicks are very young, but can occur at a later age if an outbreak of feather pecking occurs, and in some cases, birds may be beak trimmed on repeated occasions. Beak trimming is not permitted in the UK on meat chickens that are aged over 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Defra|title=Guidance on keeping of Chickens|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69382/pb13545-meat-chickens.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Acute pain =====
The beak is a complex, functional organ with an extensive nervous supply including [[nociceptors]] that sense pain and noxious stimuli.&lt;ref name="Breward, (1984)"&gt;Breward, J., (1984).  Cutaneous nociceptors in the chicken beak. Proceedings of the Journal of Physiology, London 346: 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentle, (1992)"&gt;Gentle, M.J., (1992). Pain in birds. Animal Welfare, 1: 235-247&lt;/ref&gt;  These would almost certainly be stimulated during beak trimming, indicating strongly that acute pain would be experienced. Behavioural evidence of pain after beak trimming in layer hen chicks has been based on the observed reduction in pecking behavior, reduced activity and social behavior, and increased sleep duration.&lt;ref name="Gentle et al., (1982)"&gt;Gentle M.J., Hughes B.O. and Hubrecht R.C., (1982). The effect of beak-trimming on food-intake, feeding behaviour and body weight in adult hens. Applied Animal Ethology, 8: 147–157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duncan et al., (1989)"&gt;Duncan I.J.H., Slee G.S., Seawright E. and Breward J., (1989). Behavioural consequences of partial beak amputation (beak trimming) in poultry. British Poultry Science, 30: 479–488&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentle et al., (1991)"&gt;Gentle M.J., Hunter L.N. and Waddington D., (1991).

Behavioural and anatomical consequences of two beak trimming methods in 1- and 10-d-old domestic chicks. British Poultry Science, 38: 453-463&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Japanese quail]], beak-trimming by cauterization caused lower body weights and feed intake in the period just after beak trimming.&lt;ref name="Lagana et al., (2011)"&gt;Lagana, C., Pizzolante, C.C., Togashi, C.K., Kakimoto, S.K., Saldanha, E.S.P.B. and Alvares, V., (2011).  Beak trimming method and drinking system and their effect on the performance and egg quality of Japanese quails. Revista Brasileira de Zootecnia-Brazilian Journal of Animal Science, 40: 1217-1221&lt;/ref&gt;  Beak trimmed [[Muscovy ducks]] spent less time engaging in beak-related behaviours (preening, feeding, drinking, exploratory pecking) and more time resting than non-trimmed ducks in the days immediately post-trim. These differences disappeared by 1 week post-trim. At 1 week post-trim the trimmed ducks weighed less than non-trimmed ducks, but this difference disappeared by 2 weeks post-trim.&lt;ref name="Gustafson et al., (2007)"&gt;Gustafson, L.A., Cheng, H.W., Garner, J.P., Pajor, E.A. and Mench, J.A., (2007). Effects of bill-trimming Muscovy ducks on behavior, body weight gain, and bill morphopathology.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 103: 59-74&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, however, unclear if the above changes in behaviour arise from pain or from a loss of sensitivity in the beak.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Gentle, (1995)"&gt;Hughes, B.O. and Gentle, M.J., (1995). Beak trimming in poultry: Its implications for welfare. World’s Poultry Science Journal, 51: 51–61&lt;/ref&gt;  Pecking force has been found to decrease after beak trimming in adult hens&lt;ref name="Freire et al., (2008)"&gt;Freire, R., Glatz, P. and Hinch, G., (2008). Self-administration of an analgesic does not alleviate pain in beak trimmed chickens. Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Science, 21: 443–448&lt;/ref&gt; possibly indicating that hens are protecting a painful area from further stimulation. However, pecking force did not differ between chicks with or without minor beak-trims at 2 to 9 days of age, suggesting that chicks with minor beak-trims do not experience pain from the beak.&lt;ref name="Friere et al., (2011)"&gt;Freire, R., Eastwood, M.A. and Joyce, M., (2011).  Minor beak trimming in chickens leads to loss of mechanoreception and magnetoreception.  Journal Animal Science, 89: 1201-1206&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Chronic pain=====
Severe beak trimming, or beak trimming birds at an older age is thought to cause chronic pain.  Following beak trimming of older or adult hens, the nociceptors in the beak stump show abnormal patterns of neural discharge, which indicate acute pain.&lt;ref name="Breward, (1984)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Breward, (1985)"&gt;Breward, J., (1985). ''An Electrophysiological Investigation of the Effects of Beak Trimming in the Domestic Fowl (''Gallus gallus domesticus'')''. Ph.D. thesis, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentle, (1986)"&gt;Gentle, M.J., (1986).  Beak trimming in poultry.

Neuroma formation and abnormal afferent nerve discharges after partial break amputation (beak trimming) in poultry.  Experientia, 41: 1132-1134. {{doi|10.1007/BF01951693}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neuromas]], tangled masses of swollen regenerating axon sprouts,&lt;ref name="Devor and Rappaport, (1990)"&gt;Devor, M. and Rappaport, Z.H., (1990). ''Pain Syndromes in Neurology''., edited by H.L. Fields, Butterworths, London, p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt; are found in the healed stumps of birds beak trimmed at 5 weeks of age or older and in severely beak trimmed birds.&lt;ref name="Lunam et al., (1996)"&gt;Lunam, C.A., Glatz, P.C. and Hsu, Y-J., (1996). The absence of neuromas in beaks of adult hens after conservative trimming at hatch. Australian Veterinary Journal, 74: 46-49&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuromas have been associated with [[phantom pain]] in human amputees and have therefore been linked to chronic pain in beak trimmed birds.  If beak trimming is severe because of improper procedure or done in older birds, the neuromas will persist which suggests that beak trimmed older birds experience [[chronic pain]], although this has been debated.&lt;ref name="Kuenzel, (2007)"&gt;Kuenzel, W.J. (2001).  Neurobiological basis of sensory perception: welfare implications of beak trimming. Poultry Science, 86: 1273-1282&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
{{Main article|Feather pecking}}
The benefits of beak trimming are mainly welfare advantages for birds kept in close confinement, some of which directly relate to increases (or reduced decreases) in production.  These include reduced feather pecking and cannibalism, better feathering (though they find it hard to preen with shortened beaks, which means they are not cleaning themselves well), less fearfulness and nervousness, less chronic stress, and decreased mortality.&lt;ref name="Hester and Shea-Moore, (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lambton et al., (2010)"&gt;Lambton, S.L., Knowles, T.G., Yorke, C. and Nicol, C.J., (2010).  The risk factors affecting the development of gentle and severe feather pecking in loose housed laying hens.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 123: 32–42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
A range of options have been proposed as possible alternatives to beak trimming including modifying the genetics of domesticated poultry to reduce cannibalistic tendencies. For confined housing where light control is possible, lowering light intensity so that birds cannot see each other as easily reduces antagonistic encounters and aggressive behaviour. Enrichment devices, introduced at an early age, such as simple objects hung in a habitat, can reduce aggressive behavior. Dividing the population into smaller group sizes reduces cannibalism. Proper body weight management that avoids underweight pullets reduces the probability of underweight pullets with uterine prolapse that leads to [[Vent pecking|cloacal cannibalism]].&lt;ref name="Glatz, (2005)" /&gt;

[[Image:Ephebe (5th cent. B.C.) - Museo Archeologico Regionale - Agrigento - Italy 2015.JPG|thumb|225px|The ''Agrigento Ephebe'', a [[severe style]] Greek sculpture of the 5th century BCE in the museum of [[Agrigento]], Sicily.]]
'''''Ephebos''''' (ἔφηβος) (often in the plural '''''epheboi'''''), also anglicised as '''''ephebe''''' (plural: '''''ephebes''''') or archaically '''''ephebus''''' (plural: '''''ephebi'''''), is a [[Greek language|Greek]] term for a male [[adolescent]], or for a social status reserved for that age, in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]].

==History==
===Greece===
[[Image:Kouros' Head, Acropolis' museum, Athens.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Blond Kouros's Head of the Acropolis]] museum in [[Athens]].]]
Though the word can simply refer to the adolescent age of young men of training age, its main use is for the members, exclusively from that age group, of an official institution (''ephebeia'') that saw to building them into citizens, but especially training them as soldiers, sometimes already sent into the field; the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city state]] (''[[polis]]'') mainly depended, as the [[Roman republic]] before [[Gaius Marius]]' reform, on its militia of citizens for defense.

In regards to Greek mythology, the ephebe was a young man or initiate, around the ages of 17 to 18, who was put through a period of isolation from his prior community, usually the world of his mother, where he was a child in the community. The ephebe would need to hunt, rely on his senses, on aggression, stealth, and trickery to survive. At the end of the initiation, the ephebe was reincorporated back into society as a man. The idea was that if the community was ever threatened, its men would have these skills needed to protect it.

===Rome===
In Rome, where the elite (mainly [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]) were often sent to Greece or received Greek teachers, the Greek word was adopted in the [[Latin]]ate form ''ephebus'' (plural ''ephebi''), and fixed at the 16 to 20 age bracket.

==Sculpture==
In [[Ancient Greek sculpture]], an '''ephebe''' is a sculptural type depicting a nude ''ephebos'' ([[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] examples of the type are also often known as the [[kouros]] type, or kouroi in the plural). This typological name often occurs in the form "the ''{{var|X}} Ephebe''", where {{var|X}} is the collection to which the object belongs or belonged, or the site on which it was found (e.g. the ''Agrigento Ephebe'').

'''''Every Valley''''' is a studio album by British [[art rock]] band [[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]]. The group's third original album, it is a [[concept album]] which focuses on a topic of [[modern history]], much like the band's previous work. The album's story depicts the history of the [[Mining in Wales|mining industry in Wales]], more specifically chronicling the rise and decline of the country's [[Coal industry in Wales|coal industry]]. The band's lead songwriter, J Willgoose, Esq., described the album's premise as an allegory for today's "abandoned and neglected communities across the western world", which have led to a "malignant, cynical and calculating brand of politics."

''Every Valley'' was recorded [[in situ]] in the former [[steelworks]] town of [[Ebbw Vale]], in [[South Wales]]. The band made use of a defunct hall formerly used as a convention space by the town's local workers' institute for the album's recording. It also features guest appearances by Welsh musicians [[James Dean Bradfield]] and [[Lisa Jên|Lisa Jên Brown]], Scottish singer Tracyanne Campbell (of [[Camera Obscura (band)|Camera Obscura]]) and English band [[Haiku Salut]], as well as the [[Beaufort Male Choir]]. The album was released by [[PIAS Recordings]] on 7 July 2017.

''Every Valley'' has been described as "a story of industrial decline", by the band's lead writer J. Willgoose Esq. in a post on social media blog site [[Tumblr]].&lt;ref name="clashmusic-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Robin|title=Public Service Broadcasting Announce New Album 'Every Valley'|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/public-service-broadcasting-announce-new-album-every-valley|website=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|publisher=Music Republic Ltd|accessdate=20 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320121924/http://www.clashmusic.com/news/public-service-broadcasting-announce-new-album-every-valley|archivedate=20 March 2017|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album begins in the "golden age" of the [[Mining in Wales|mining industry in Wales]], and documents the industry's progress, decline, and its aftermath, with the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|nationwide miners' strike]] playing a crucial role in the album's story.&lt;ref name="clashmusic-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diy-1"/&gt; While Willgoose and his family has no involvement in Wales' mining industry, he cited "the romanticism of the valleys and their geography", and his interest in the country's history with mining, as inspirations for the creation of ''Every Valley''.&lt;ref name="diy-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Will|title=Public Service Broadcasting announce new album ‘Every Valley’|url=http://diymag.com/2017/03/20/public-service-broadcasting-new-album-every-valley-progress-listen|website=[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]|publisher=Sonic Media Group|accessdate=20 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320122140/http://diymag.com/2017/03/20/public-service-broadcasting-new-album-every-valley-progress-listen|archivedate=20 March 2017|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary political themes were also a driver for the album's development, with Willgoose stating that the decline of the Welsh mining industry was "a story reflected in abandoned and neglected communities across the western world, and one which has led to the resurgence of a particularly malignant, cynical and calculating brand of politics."&lt;ref name="diy-1"/&gt;

"Progress", the fourth track on ''Every Valley'', was inspired by the sound of [[Kraftwerk]], with its bass line and use of a [[vocoder]] drawing parallels to the tropes of the German [[electronic music|electronic]] group.&lt;ref name="npr-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boilen|first1=Bob|authorlink1=Bob Boilen|title=How Public Service Broadcasting Tells The Future Using The Past|url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/522182626/how-public-service-broadcasting-tells-the-future-using-the-past|website=[[NPR|National Public Radio]]|publisher=[[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]|accessdate=3 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403224954/http://www.npr.org/event/music/522182626/how-public-service-broadcasting-tells-the-future-using-the-past|archivedate=3 April 2017|date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song, which appeared on a single prior to the release of the album, was intended by Willgoose as a message that "progress will win in the end", using samples of 1950s documentaries on the progress of technology in the mining industry, and a chorus stating "I believe in progress".&lt;ref name="diy-2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Will|title=Public Service Broadcasting announce their return with ‘Progress’|url=http://diymag.com/2017/03/09/public-service-broadcasting-new-single-progress-2017-listen|website=[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]|publisher=Sonic Media Group|accessdate=20 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320130403/http://diymag.com/2017/03/09/public-service-broadcasting-new-single-progress-2017-listen|archivedate=20 March 2017|date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willgoose also affirmed that the song continued the band's motto of "celebrating human achievements, innovation and resilience, even in the face of overwhelming odds", combating his fear that people thought of his band as purely nostalgia-based. He also affirmed that "Progress" is "an attempt to state that more explicitly, especially at a time when certain regressive elements seem determined to take us back to some non-existent, halcyon 1950s era."&lt;ref name="diy-2"/&gt;

==Recording==
[[File:Ash Grove, Ebbw Vale - geograph.org.uk - 1125148.jpg|thumb|View of the defunct [[Ebbw Vale Steelworks|steelworks factory]] near [[Ebbw Vale]], where the band recorded ''Every Valley''.]]
Immersing themselves in the album's theme, the band traveled to [[Ebbw Vale]], [[Wales]], a former [[Ebbw Vale Steelworks|steelworks town]], where they recorded ''Every Valley'' in the lecture hall of a defunct workers' institute. J. Willgoose Esq. wrote of the idea to record in Ebbw Vale, "it seemed important to record in the valleys, as I wanted this album to feel connected to the area it was written about in ways our previous albums hadn’t been. I wanted the album to have a rich, earthy, full sound, and to carry some of the lilt and lyricism of the language itself."&lt;ref name="clashmusic-1"/&gt; To assist and inform the record's production, the band conducted interviews with local townspeople in Ebbw Vale about their histories with the mining industry in the region, of which some were recorded and appear on the album itself.&lt;ref name="npr-1"/&gt;

Four featured artists appear on ''Every Valley'', including two of Willgoose's idols – [[James Dean Bradfield]], known for his role as the frontman of Welsh [[alternative rock]] band [[Manic Street Preachers]], and Tracyanne Campbell, the lead singer and guitarist for Scottish [[indie pop]] band [[Camera Obscura (band)|Camera Obscura]]. They appear on "Turn No More" and "Progress" respectively.&lt;ref name="npr-1"/&gt; The album also features Welsh actress and singer [[Lisa Jên|Lisa Jen Brown]], of [[Welsh language]] folk band [[9 Bach]], on "You + Me", and the English [[post rock]] band [[Haiku Salut]] on "They Gave Me a Lamp".&lt;ref name="npr-1"/&gt; ''Every Valley'' marks the first Public Service Broadcasting record to contain vocals by its frontman, J. Willgoose Esq..

==Promotion==
The announcement of the album's release was shortly preceded by the release of "Progress", one of the album's tracks, on a [[single (music)|single]] of the same name on 9 March 2017.&lt;ref name="clashmusic-2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Robin|title=Listen: Public Service Broadcasting – 'Progress'|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/listen-public-service-broadcasting-progress|website=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|publisher=Music Republic Ltd|accessdate=20 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320130159/http://www.clashmusic.com/news/listen-public-service-broadcasting-progress|archivedate=20 March 2017|date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diy-2"/&gt; ''Every Valley'' was officially unveiled by the band on 20 March, through an announcement video uploaded onto the band's social media pages that detailed the album's title and a release date of 7 July 2017.&lt;ref name="clashmusic-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diy-1"/&gt; Two weeks later, on 3 April, the album was put up for pre-order on their website and through various retailers. The album's full track list and featured artists were also revealed on the day.&lt;ref name="npr-1"/&gt; The album will be released on [[compact disc]], [[Music download|digital download]] and [[LP record|LP vinyl]] formats, along with a limited edition clear vinyl format.&lt;ref name="banquetrecords-gb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Service Broadcasting – Every Valley|url=https://www.banquetrecords.com/public-service-broadcasting/every-valley/PIASR970CDX|website=[[Banquet Records]]|accessdate=3 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403223017/https://www.banquetrecords.com/public-service-broadcasting/every-valley/PIASR970CDX|archivedate=3 April 2017|date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A music video for "Progress" was also released on 3 April. The video, which pays a homage to the signature surrealism of the music videos of [[Kraftwerk]], features the band surveying the musical progress of cloned versions of themselves, with scientists in [[white coat]] also observing and recording notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]]|date=3 April 2017|title=Public Service Broadcasting – Progress |medium=video|language=English|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ZbdGBAqZQ|access-date=3 April 2017|publisher=[[Vevo]], [[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willgoose stated about the video, "the song itself nods quite heavily to Kraftwerk, we also thought it'd be nice to make the video a similarly respectful doff of the cap in their direction."&lt;ref name="npr-1"/&gt; Prior to the release of the album, two shows by the band, billed as "Every Valley Live", will be played at the Ebbw Vale Institute on 8 and 9 June, staged to preview and promote the album's release. The concerts will be preceded themselves by a previously-announced show at the [[Electric Ballroom]], in [[London]], [[England]], on 31 May.&lt;ref name="stereobard-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Laura|title=Public Service Broadcasting Confirm Summer Release For New Album 'Every Valley'|url=http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/206048/9|website=Stereoboard|publisher=Eyedigit Limited|accessdate=20 March 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170320130044/http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/206048/9|archivedate=20 March 2017|date=20 March 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food composition data (FCD)''' are detailed sets of information on the nutritionally important components of foods and provide values for energy and nutrients including protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins and minerals and for other important food components such as fibre. The data are presented in [[food composition database]]s (FCDBs).

In the [[UK]], FCD is listed in tables known as The Chemical Composition of Foods, McCance and Widdowson (1940)&lt;ref name="McCance RA 1940"&gt;McCance RA &amp; Widdowson EM (1940) The Chemical Composition of Foods, Medical Research Council Special Report Series No. 235. His Majesty’s Stationery Office: London.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the first edition the authors stated that:

‘A knowledge of the chemical composition of foods is the first essential in the dietary treatment of disease or in any quantitative study of human nutrition’.

This demonstrates the main reason for establishing FCD at that time. To this day, food composition studies remain central to nutrition research into the role of food components and their interactions in health and disease. However, due to increasing levels of sophistication and complexity in nutrition science, there is a greater demand for complete, current and reliable FCD, together with information on a wider range of food components, including bioactive compounds.&lt;ref name="Church"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Church | first1 = S | year = 2009 | title = Food composition explained. EuroFIR Synthesis report No. 7 | url = | journal = Nutrition Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 250–272 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-3010.2009.01775.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FCD are important in many fields including clinical practice, research, nutrition policy, public health and education, and the food manufacturing industry and is used in a variety of ways including: national programmes for the assessment of diet and nutritional status at a population level (e.g. epidemiological researchers assessing diets at a population level); development of therapeutic diets (e.g. to treat obesity, diabetes, nutritional deficiencies, food allergy and intolerance) and institutional diets (e.g. schools, hospitals, prisons, day-care centres) and nutrition labelling of processed foods.&lt;ref name="Church" /&gt;

The earliest food composition tables were based solely on chemical analyses of food samples, which were mostly undertaken specifically for the tables. However, as the food supply has evolved, and with the increasing demand for nutritional and related components, it has become more difficult for compilers to rely only on chemical analysis when compiling FCDBs. For example, in the UK the third edition of The Composition of Foods&lt;ref&gt;McCance RA &amp; Widdowson EM (1960) The Composition of Foods, 3rd edn., Medical Research Council Special Report Series No. 297. Her Majesty’s Stationery Office: London.&lt;/ref&gt; presented data on vitamin content of foods. However, due to the amount of information already available and in order to avoid the need to analyse every food for every vitamin, values from the scientific literature were included, although the tables are still predominately based on analytical data. Nowadays, food composition databases tend to be compiled using a variety of methods, including:

==Chemical analysis==
Chemical analysis of food samples carried out in analytical laboratories is typically the preferred method for creating FCD. The food samples are carefully chosen using a defined sampling plan to ensure that they are representative of the foods being consumed in a country. This includes accounting for factors that could affect the nutrient content of a food as purchased (e.g. region and/or country of origin, season, brand, fortification) or as consumed (e.g. storage, preparation and cooking methods). If necessary, further preparation and cooking takes place prior to the analysis using appropriate analytical methods and often appropriate samples of foods are combined rather than taking averages of individually analysed food samples. Ideally, the methods used for analysis should have been shown to be reliable and reproducible, i.e. those recommended by organisation such as the [[AOAC International|Association of Official Analytical Chemists]] (AOAC)  or the [[International Organisation for Standardisation]] (ISO).

==Imputing and calculating values from data already within the database==
It is not feasible to determine FCD using chemical analysis for every nutrient in every food type due to insufficient resources. Therefore, compilers of FCDB use other approaches to determine the required FCD within a FCDB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schakel | first1 = SF | last2 = Buzzard | first2 = IM | last3 = Gebhardt | first3 = SE | year = 1997 | title = Procedures for estimating nutrient values for food composition databases | url = | journal = Journal of Food Composition and Analysis | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 102–14 | doi=10.1006/jfca.1997.0527}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, to estimate values for a cooked food values for a raw food or dish can often be used, together with information on likely weight (or yield) gain/loss and nutrient changes (e.g. vitamin losses) due to cooking.

==Estimating FCD values from other sources==
Another approach commonly used by FCD compilers is to ‘borrow’ or ‘adopt’ nutrient values that were originally generated by another organisation. Possible sources for borrowed data: are FCD from other countries, nutrient analyses from scientific literature or manufacturers’ data (e.g. from food labels). Compilers will need to evaluate the data in terms of both data quality and applicability of foods before incorporating it from any of these sources into their FCDBs. For example, fortification values can differ between countries so a fortified breakfast cereal for one country’s FCD might not be appropriate for another country.

==Data evaluation and quality==
An important step for both new analytical FCD and for values borrowed from other sources is for the compiler to evaluate the quality of the data before it can be added into FCDBs. Basic evaluation, where feasible, should be considered such as comparing the values to similar foods from other sources and checking whether the sums of the values equate to ~100% e.g. sum of water, protein, fat, carbohydrate and dietary fibre. In addition, a range of data quality measures need to be undertaken relating to the food identity and sampling and analytical aspects. For example, the USA has developed a multi-nutrient data quality evaluation system for which five evaluation categories are used including: sampling plan, number of samples, sample handling, analytical method and analytical quality control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holden | first1 = JM | last2 = Bhagwat | first2 = SA | last3 = Patterson | first3 = KY | year = 2002 | title = Development of a multinutrient data quality evaluation system | url = | journal = Journal of Food Composition and Analysis | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 339–48 | doi=10.1006/jfca.2002.1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings for each category are combined to give a ‘Quality Index’ and a confidence code indicating to users the level of confidence for each value. In Europe, [[European Food Information Resource Network|EuroFIR]] is currently developing a data quality evaluation system for European data based on the USA’s version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westenbrink | first1 = S | last2 = Oseredczuk | first2 = M | last3 = Castenheira | first3 = I | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Food composition databases: the EuroFIR approach to develop tools to assure the quality of the data compilation process | url = | journal = Food Chemistry | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 759–67 | doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.05.112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food composition dataset==
Food composition datasets (FCDBs) or food composition tables are resources that provide detailed food composition data (FCD) on the nutritionally important components of foods. FCDBs provide values for [[energy]] and [[nutrient]]s including [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]], [[vitamin]]s and [[Dietary mineral|mineral]]s and for other important food components such as [[fibre]].

Before computer technology, these resources existed in printed tables with the oldest tables dating back to the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Atwater"&gt;Atwater WO &amp; Woods CD (1896) The chemical composition of American food materials. US Office of Experiment Stations, Experiment Stations Bulletin 28. Government Printing Office: Washington, DC. Available at: http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=9447&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[UK]], FCD are listed in tables known as The Chemical Composition of Foods, [[Robert McCance|McCance]] and [[Elsie Widdowson|Widdowson]] (1940).&lt;ref&gt;FSA (2002) McCance and Widdowson’s The Composition of Foods, 6th Summary Edition. Cambridge: Royal Society of Chemistry.&lt;/ref&gt;   FCDBs have become available online on the internet, for example, the [[USDA]] Dataset in the States, the  Japanese food composition dataset and a number of  European food composition datasets. Foods from these national FCDBs can be identified by [[International Food Code (IFC)]].

FCDBs differ in both the data that is available and in the amount of data that is held. For example, some FCDBs have values for individual [[amino acid]]s and/or vitamin fractions (e.g. individual [[carotenoid]]s, such as [[lycopene]] and [[lutein]]). Some specialised datasets are also available e.g. [[bioactive compound]]s are included in the [[European Food Information Resource Network|EuroFIR]] eBASIS dataset, in the US [[isoflavone]] dataset&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwat S, Haytowitz DB &amp; Holden JM (2008) U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service (USDA) dataset for the Isoflavone Content of Selected Foods, Release 2.0. Nutrient Data. Available at: http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/isoflav/Isoflav_R2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and in the French [[Phenol-Explorer]] dataset.&lt;ref&gt;Neveu V, Perez-Jiménez J, Vos F, Crespy V et al (2010) Phenol-Explorer: an online comprehensive dataset on polyphenol contents in foods. dataset, {{DOI|10.1093/dataset/bap024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the 2009 version of the Swiss FCDB contains 935 foods, while the recent version of the [[USDA]] FCDB includes over 7,500 foods. Some datasets include a wider range of processed foods, composite dishes and recipes as well as foods prepared and cooked in different ways. For example, in the UK FCDB bacon rashers are included as raw, dry-fried, grilled, grilled crispy or microwaved.

The data are estimations.
* Variability in the composition of foods between countries, owing to, for example, season, cultivar or variety, brand, fortification levels
* Incomplete coverage of foods or [[nutrient]]s leading to missing values
* Age of data (limited resources mean that, inevitably, some values are not current)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Church | first1 = S | year = 2009 | title = Food composition explained. [[European Food Information Resource Network|EuroFIR]] Synthesis report No. 7 | url = | journal = Nutrition Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 250–272 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-3010.2009.01775.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection process===
FCDBs are usually created using a variety of methods including (see Food composition data):
* Chemical analysis of food samples carried out in analytical laboratories
* Imputing and calculating values from data already within the dataset
* Estimating values from other sources, including manufacturers food labels, scientific literature and FCDBs from other countries.

===History===
Some of the earliest work related to detecting adulterated foods and finding the active components of medicinal herbs.

Food composition tables in the format known today were  published towards the end of the 19th century although, some tables on the chemical composition of mineral waters were assembled by [[Morveau]] as early as 1780.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colombani | first1 = PC | year = 2011 | title = On the origins of food composition tables | doi = 10.1016/j.jfca.2010.09.007 | journal = J Food Compos Anal | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 732–737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1896,  tables from the USA were published, incorporating nearly 2600 analyses of a wide range of foods including the main food groups, as well as some processed foods. Values for foods were presented as ‘refuse’, water, protein, fats, carbohydrates, ash, and ‘fuel value’.&lt;ref name="Atwater" /&gt;

The first UK tables, known as McCance and Widdowson’s The Composition of Foods, were published in 1940.&lt;ref name="McCance RA 1940"/&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) published tables for international use and initially intended these for the assessment of food availability at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;Chatfield C (1949) Food composition tables for international use. FAO Nutritional Study No 3. FAO UN: Washington, DC. Available at: http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5557e/x5557e00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
A list of International FCDBs can be found on the [http://frida.fooddata.dk/otherdb.php National Food Institute - Technical University of Denmark's] (DTU) website.

==Documentation==
The documentation of FCD is an important process of compiling FCDBs because it enables the user to assess the quality of the data and whether the food and values are appropriate for the user’s intended purpose. Moreover, documentation is valuable to the compilers, both to update the FCDB and to validate decisions made during compilation. With systems generally now being computerised, it is much easier to make documentation available. 
For example, the French national database&lt;ref&gt;Agence française de Sécurite Sanitaire des aliments (AFSSA) / Centre d’information sur la qualité des aliments (CIQUAL) (2008) French food composition table version 2008. Available at: http://www.afssa.fr/TableCIQUAL/&lt;/ref&gt; provides information, where possible, on minimum and maximum values found from the different data sources used, the number of samples used to determine the selected value, a reference code corresponding to data sources for a given value, and a confidence code characterising the quality of the given value. [[European Food Information Resource Network|EuroFIR]] has developed a framework for the documentation of FCD, which forms the basis of a new European standard for the interchange and harmonisation of FCD across Europe.

The external funding ratio was 75 percent. 49,8 percent of the budget came from industrial revenues, 13 percent from federal and state contract research, and 6,5 percent from funds provided by the European Union. Around 270 employees and 140 students worked at the institute in 2015.

==History==
=== Establishment of the institute ===
The founding phase of the [[Heinrich Hertz|Heinrich Hertz Institute]] began on August 1, 1927 with the written intention of the Study Society for Oscillation Research to establish an institute for the research on electrical and acoustic oscillation at the Technical University of Berlin. Members of this society were the [[Reichspost|German Reichspost]], the Prussian Ministry of Science, Art and National Education, the [[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]], the [[Technical University of Berlin|Technische Hochschule zu Berlin]], the large corporations of the electrical industry, and the [[Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik|German Electrical Engineering Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freunde.hhi.de/html/historisches.html History of the Heinrich-Hertz Institute] – www.freunde.hhi.de, as of January 31,2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effectively, the institute was founded on February 23, 1928 as Heinrich Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research. The opening took place in 1930 in Berlin-Charlottenburg, Franklinstrasse 1, with the 4 departments: High-Frequency Engineering, Telecommunications and Telegraph Technology, Acoustics and Mechanics. Research focused on radio and television technology, room acoustics and electronic music among other things. 
The institute was reorganized in 1936 and the name Heinrich Hertz was wiped out from its designation in the course of [[Nazism|National Socialist]] [[Purge|"cleansing"]] in the interest of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].

=== Post World War II ===
After the institute building was entirely destroyed in 1945, the Heinrich Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research was newly founded in the same year by Gustav Leithäuser with the former department structure. During the time of the currency reform and [[Berlin Blockade]] in 1950, the institute was split into an eastern section ([[Berlin-Adlershof]]) and a western section ([[Berlin-Charlottenburg]], Jebensstrasse 1). In 1968 the institute moved into the new building at Einsteinufer 37 in Berlin.

=== Institute with state and federal participation ===
The institute was renamed to Heinrich-Hertz-Institut for Nachrichtentechnik Berlin GmbH (Heinrich-Hertz Institute for Communication Technology) in 1975 with the state of [[Berlin]] and the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] as shareholders. Realignment of the entire HHI research profile by Horst Ohnsorge. Systematic work on current problems of modern communication technology. Vision of a universal broadband communication network on a fiber optics basis. 5 specialist departments: General Principles; System Structures; Image and Sound; Relaying and Transmission; Planning. Support for optical communication engineering as a key technology at HHI in the 1980s. Restructuring of the institute with formation of two divisions: Communication Systems with the departments of Relaying and Transmission, Signal Processing and Terminal Equipment, Economic and Social Sciences Accompanying Research, and Human Engineering, and the division: Integrated Optics.

In the 1990s research focused on the following fields: Photonic networks, electronic imaging technology for multimedia, mobile broadband systems, and integrated optics.

=== Transition to the Fraunhofer Society ===
The institute became part of the [[Fraunhofer Society]] in 2003 and received today’s name, Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, HHI. The institute has been cooperating with the neighboring [[Technical University of Berlin]] for decades.

A data transmission system was successfully developed in 2006 with a never-before-seen speed of 2560 [[Gb/s]], which means transmitting a data volume corresponding to the content of 60 [[DVD]]s takes one second. What’s more, a breakthrough was achieved in video compression making it possible to store motion pictures in the high-resolution [[High-definition television|HDTV]] format with 2 million pixels per image on DVD.

On November 10, 2016 scientists of the Fraunhofer HHI established a bidirectional 1.7 [[Terabit|Tbit]]/s [[Free-space optical communication|free-space optical communications]] link over the air. The eye-safe optical beam transmission was transmitted over a distance of 380 meters. Eye-safe operation through 380-m air was successfully demonstrated at a total antenna output power of less than 10 [[Milliwatt|mW]]. The signals in both directions consisted of 40 wavelength channels of 43 Gbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/press-media/news/2016/2x17-terabits-eye-safe-optical-link-demonstrated-over-380-meters-at-fraunhofer-hhi.html 2x1.7-Terabit/s eye-safe optical link demonstrated over 380 meters at Fraunhofer HHI] – hhi.fraunhofer.de, February 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55560">This is a glossary of some of the terms used in [[phytopathology]].

Phytopathology is the study of plant diseases.  It is a multi-disciplinary science since prerequisites for disease development are the presence of a susceptible host species, a pathogen and the appropriate environmental conditions.  This is known as the [[glossary of phytopathology#disease triangle|disease triangle]].  Because of this interaction, the terminology used in phytopathology often comes from other disciplines including those dealing with the host species ([[Botany| botany / plant science]], [[plant physiology]]), the pathogen ([[Bacteria|bacteriology]], [[mycology]], [[Nematodes|nematology]], [[virology]]), the environment and disease management practices ([[agronomy]], [[soil science]], [[meteorology]], [[environmental science]], [[ecology]], [[plant breeding]], [[pesticides]], [[entomology]]), and areas of study that apply to both the host and pathogen ([[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[molecular genetics]]).  The result is that most phytopathological glossary include terms from these other disciplines in addition to terms ([[glossary of phytopathology#disease incidence|disease incidence]], [[glossary of phytopathology#horizontal resistance|horizontal resistance]], [[glossary of phytopathology#gene-for-gene hypothesis|gene-for-gene relationship]], [[glossary of phytopathology#blast|blast]], [[glossary of phytopathology#scab|scab]] and so on) that are specific to, or which have a unique meaning in phytopathology. This glossary is no exception. However, for the sake of brevity, it has, for the most part, restricted terms from other disciplines to those that pertain to the pathogen.  At some point, these terms should be moved to other glossaries (e.g. [[glossary of mycology]], [[glossary of nematology]], and so on).

The collection's abbreviation of "'''HHA'''" can be used to identify individual works by Handel, for example Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' can be referred to as "HHA i/17" (with the Roman numeral "i" designating "series 1").&lt;ref name="Grove 2001 p.785"/&gt; For practical use, the HHA numbering of Handel's works has been superseded by the [[Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] numbering system.

Published by the George Frideric Handel Society, a major new edition comprising approximately 128 volumes is being released. It is expected to be completed by 2023 in the following configuration:

'''Hydrogen darkening''' is a physical degradation of the [[Glass#Optical properties|optical properties]] of [[glass]]. Free hydrogen atoms are able to bind to the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[silica]] glass compound forming [[hydroxyl]] (OH)—a chemical compound that interferes with the passage of light through the glass.

The problem is particularly relevant to [[fiber optic cable]]s—particularly in oil and gas wells where fiber optic cables are used for [[distributed temperature sensing]]. Hydrogen can be present due to the [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of [[hydrocarbon]]s in the well.  The darkening of the fiber can distort the DTS reading and possibly render the DTS system inoperable due to the [[optical loss budget]] being exceeded.

To prevent this, coatings such as [[carbon]] are applied to the fiber, and hydrogen capturing gels are used to buffer the fiber, and other proprietary techniques may be used to prevent hydrogen atoms from reaching the glass fiber via the [[cable sheath]].

[[File:Csöves villámfeszítő.png|thumb|Jedlik's tubular voltage generator]]
An '''impulse generator''' is an electrical apparatus which produces very short high-voltage or high-current surges. Such devices can be classified into two types: impulse voltage generators and impulse current generators. High impulse voltages are used to test the strength of electric power equipment against lightning and switching surges. Also, steep-front impulse voltages are sometimes used in nuclear physics experiments. High impulse currents are needed not only for tests on equipment such as lightning arresters and fuses but also for many other technical applications such as lasers, thermonuclear fusion, and plasma devices.

== Jedlik's tubular voltage generator ==

In 1863 Hungarian physicist [[Ányos Jedlik]] discovered the possibility of voltage multiplication and in 1868 demonstrated it with a "tubular voltage generator", which was successfully displayed at the [[Vienna World Exposition]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no162/020.html |title=Innovators and Innovations |last=Sipka |first=László |date=Summer 2001 |accessdate=August 23, 2010 |issue=162 |volume=XLII |journal=Hungarian Quarterly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615095831/http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no162/020.html |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an early form of the impulse generators now applied in nuclear research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 2nd| publisher = Vista Books| isbn = 0962842206| last = Sisa| first = Stephen| title = The spirit of Hungary: a panorama of Hungarian history and culture| page = 308 |  location = Morristown, N.J| date = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury of the World Exhibition of 1873 in Vienna awarded his voltage multiplying condenser of [[Cascade connection (capacitors)|cascade connection]] with prize "For Development". Through this condenser, Jedlik framed the principle of surge generator of cascaded connection. (The Cascade connection was another important invention of Ányos Jedlik.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institutoideal.org/conteudo_eng.php?&amp;sys=biblioteca_eng&amp;arquivo=1&amp;artigo=94&amp;ano=2008 |title=Instituto IDEAL [English&amp;#93; |publisher=Instituto IDEAL [English] |date= |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322223457/http://www.institutoideal.org/conteudo_eng.php?&amp;sys=biblioteca_eng&amp;arquivo=1&amp;artigo=94&amp;ano=2008 |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellotrade.com/energosolar/electronic-engineering.html |title=Electronic Engineering Manufacturer &amp; Wholesale Supplier From Hungary - Energosolar |publisher=Hellotrade.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marx generator ==
One form is the [[Marx generator]], after E. Marx who first proposed it in 1923. This consists of multiple capacitors that are first charged in parallel through charging resistors by a high-voltage, direct-current source and then connected in series and discharged through a test object by a simultaneous spark-over of the spark gaps. The impulse current generator comprises many capacitors that are also charged in parallel by a high-voltage, low-current, direct-current source, but it is discharged in parallel through resistances, inductances, and a test object by a spark gap.

'''Information processing''' is the change (processing) of [[information]] in any manner detectable by an [[observation|observer]].  As such, it is a  process that ''describes'' everything that happens (changes) in the [[universe]], from the falling of a rock (a change in position) to the printing of a text file from a digital computer system. In the latter case, an [[information processor]] is changing the [[content format|form]] of presentation of that text file.
Information processing may  more specifically be defined in terms used by, [[Claude E. Shannon]] as the conversion of latent information into manifest information (McGonigle &amp; Mastrian, 2011). Latent and manifest information is defined through the terms of equivocation (remaining uncertainty, what value the sender has chosen), dissipation (uncertainty of the sender what the receiver has received), and transformation (saved effort of questioning – equivocation minus dissipation) (Denning and Bell, 2012).

==In cognitive psychology==
Within the field of [[cognitive psychology]], information processing is an approach to the goal of understanding human thinking in relation to how they process the same kind of information as computers (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1963).  It arose in the 1940s and 1950s, after World War II (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). The approach treats [[cognition]] as essentially [[Computing|computational]] in nature, with ''mind'' being the ''software'' and the brain being the ''hardware''. The information processing approach in psychology is closely allied to the [[computational theory of mind]] in philosophy; it is also related, though not identical, to [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] in psychology and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] in philosophy (Horst, 2011).

===Two types===
Information processing  may  be '''vertical''' or '''horizontal''', either of which  may be '''centralized''' or [[decentralized]] ('''distributed'''). The [[horizontal distributed processing]] approach of the mid-1980s became popular under the name [[connectionism]]. The connectionist network is made up of different nodes, and it works by a "priming effect," and this happens when a "prime node activates a connected node" (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). But "unlike in semantic networks, it is not a single node that has a specific meaning, but rather the knowledge is represented in a combination of differently activated nodes"(Goldstein, as cited in Sternberg, 2012).

===Models and theories===
There are several proposed models or theories that describe the way in which we process information.
Every individual has different information overload point with same information load, because individuals have different information-processing capacity (Eppler and Mengis, 2004)

====Sternberg's triarchic theory of intelligence====
Sternberg's [[Triarchic theory of intelligence|theory of intelligence]] is made up of three different components: creative, analytical, and practical abilities (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). Creativeness is the ability to have new original ideas, and being analytical can help a person decide whether the idea is a good one or not. "Practical abilities are used to implement the ideas and persuade others of their value" (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012 p.&amp;nbsp;21). In the middle of Sternberg's theory is cognition and with that is information processing. In Sternberg's theory, he says that information processing is made up of three different parts, metacomponents, performance components, and knowledge-acquisition components (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). These processes move from higher-order executive functions to lower order functions. Metacomponents are used for planning and evaluating problems, while performance components follow the orders of the metacomponents, and the knowledge-acquisition component learns how to solve the problems (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). This theory in action can be explained by working on an art project. First is a decision about what to draw, then a plan and a sketch. During this process there is simultaneous monitoring of the process, and whether it is producing the desired accomplishment. All these steps fall under the metacomponent processing, and the performance component is the art. The knowledge-acquisition portion is the learning or improving drawing skills.

====Information processing model: the working memory====
According to thefreedictionary.com, the definition of information processing is "the sciences concerned with gathering, manipulating, storing, retrieving, and classifying recorded information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/information+processing | title=Definition of information processing | work=The Free Dictionary | accessdate=July 26, 2016 |year=2012|publisher= Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests that for information to be firmly implanted in memory, it must pass through three stages of mental processing; sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. An example of this is the working memory model.  This includes the central executive, phonologic loop, episodic buffer,visuospatial sketchpad, verbal information, long term memory, and visual information (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012).  The central executive is like the secretary of the brain.  It decides what needs attention and how to respond.The central executive then leads to three different subsections.  The first is phonological storage, subvocal rehearsal, and the phonological loop.  These sections work together to understand words, put the information into memory, and then hold the memory.  The result is verbal information storage.  The next subsection is the visuospatial sketchpad which works to store visual images.  The storage capacity is brief but leads to understanding of visual stimuli.  Finally, there is an episodic buffer.  This section is capable of taking information and putting it into long-term memory.  It is also able to take information from the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad, combining them with long-term memory to make "a unitary episodic representation (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012).  
In order for these to work, the sensory register takes in via the five senses: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and taste. These are all present since birth and are able to handle simultaneous processing (e.g., food – taste it, smell it, see it). In general, learning benefits occur when there is a developed process of pattern recognition. The sensory register has a large capacity and its behavioral response is very short (1–3 seconds). 
Within this model, sensory store and short term memory or working memory has limited capacity. Sensory store is able to hold very limited amounts of information for very limited amounts of time.  This phenomenon is very similar to having a picture taken with a flash.  For a few brief moments after the flash goes off, the flash it seems to still be there.  However, it is soon gone and there is no way to know it was there (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). Short term memory holds information for slightly longer periods of time, but still has a limited capacity. According to Linden (2007), "The capacity of STM had initially been estimated at "seven plus or minus two" items (Miller 1956), which fits the observation from neuropsychological testing that the average digit span of healthy adults is about seven (Cowan and others 2005). However, it emerged that these numbers of items can only be retained if they are grouped into so-called chunks, using perceptual or conceptual associations between individual stimuli." Its duration is of 5–20 seconds before it is out of the subject's mind. This occurs often with names of people newly introduced to. Images or information based on meaning are stored here as well, but it decays without rehearsal or repetition of such information. 
On the other hand, long-term memory has a potentially unlimited capacity (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012) and its duration is as good as indefinite. Although sometimes it is difficult to access, it encompasses everything learned until this point in time. One might become forgetful or feel as if the information is on the [[tip of the tongue]].

====Cognitive development theory====
Another approach to viewing the ways in which information is processed in humans was suggested by [[Jean Piaget]] in what is called the ''Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory'' (Presnell, 1999). Piaget developed his model based on development and growth. He identified four different stages between different age brackets characterized by the type of information and by a distinctive thought process. The four stages are: the sensorimotor (from birth to 2 years), preoperational (2–6 years), concrete operational (6–11 years), and formal operational periods (11 years and older). During the sensorimotor stage, newborns and toddlers rely on their senses for information processing to which they respond with reflexes. In the preoperational stage, children learn through imitation and remain unable to take other people's point of view. The concrete operational stage is characterized by the developing ability to use logic and to consider multiple factors to solve a problem. The last stage is the formal operational, in which preadolescents and adolescents begin to understand abstract concepts and to develop the ability to create arguments and counter arguments.

Furthermore, adolescence is characterized by a series of changes in the biological, cognitive, and social realms. In the cognitive area, it is worth noting that the brain's prefrontal cortex as well as the limbic system undergoes important changes. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is active when engaged in complicated cognitive activities such as planning, generating goals and strategies, intuitive decision-making, and [[metacognition]] (thinking about thinking). This is consistent with Piaget's last stage of formal operations (McLeod, 2010). The prefrontal cortex becomes complete between adolescence and early adulthood. The limbic system is the part of the brain that modulates reward sensitivity based on changes in the levels of neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine) and emotions.

In short, cognitive abilities vary according to our development and stages in life. It is at the adult stage that we are better able to be better planners, process and comprehend abstract concepts, and evaluate risks and benefits more aptly than an adolescent or child would be able to.

==In computing==
In computing, '''information processing''' broadly refers to the use of algorithms to transform data—the defining activity of computers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dictionary of Computing | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=9780192800466 | edition=4th | first=Valerie | last=Illingworth | series=Oxford Paperback Reference | page=241|date=11 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, a broad computing professional organization is known as the International Federation for Information Processing ([[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]]). It is essentially synonymous with the terms [[data processing]] or [[computation]], although with a more general connotation.&lt;ref name="Ralston2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Ralston|title=Encyclopedia of computer science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQ9LAQAAIAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Nature Pub.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11886">The '''insulin index''' of a food represents how much it elevates the concentration of [[insulin]] in the blood during the two-hour period after the food is ingested. The index is similar to the [[glycemic index]] (GI) and [[glycemic load]] (GL), but rather than relying on [[blood glucose]] levels, the Insulin Index is based upon blood insulin levels. The Insulin Index represents a comparison of food portions with equal overall caloric content (250 kcal or 1000 kJ), while GI represents a comparison of portions with equal digestible carbohydrate content (typically 50 g) and the GL represents portions of a typical serving size for various foods. The Insulin Index can be more useful than either the glycemic index or the glycemic load because certain foods (e.g., lean meats and proteins) cause an insulin response despite there being no [[carbohydrate]]s present, and some foods cause a disproportionate insulin response relative to their carbohydrate load.

Holt et al.&lt;ref name=Holt1997/&gt; have noted that the glucose and insulin scores of most foods are highly correlated,&lt;ref name="Cure for Diabetes"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gabriel |last=Cousens |title=There Is a Cure for Diabetes: The Tree of Life 21-Day+ Program |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aTatu9P_XwC&amp;pg=PT144 |year=2008 |publisher=North Atlantic Books |isbn=978-1-55643-691-8 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; but high-protein foods and bakery products that are rich in fat and refined carbohydrates "elicit insulin responses that were disproportionately higher than their glycemic responses." They also conclude that insulin indices may be useful for dietary management and avoidance of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia.

==Explanation of Index==
The Insulin Index is not the same as a glycemic index (GI), which is based exclusively on the digestible carbohydrate content of a food, and represents a comparison of foods in amounts with equal digestible carbohydrate content (typically 50 g). The insulin index compares foods in amounts with equal overall caloric content (250 kcal or 1000 kJ). Insulin indexes are scaled relative to white bread, while glycemic index scores nowadays are usually scaled with respect to pure glucose, although in the past white bread has been a reference point for GI measurements as well.
In the chart below, glycemic and insulin scores show the increase in the blood concentration of each. A higher [[satiety]] score indicates how much less was eaten from a buffet after participants ate the listed food.

{{Reflist|group=n}}

Glucose (glycemic) and insulin scores were determined by feeding 1000 kilojoules (239 kilocalories) of the food to the participants and recording the area under the glucose/insulin curve for 120 minutes then dividing by the area under the glucose/insulin curve for white bread.  The result being that all scores are relative to [[white bread]]. The satiety score was determined by comparing how satiated participants felt within two hours after being fed a fixed number of calories (240 kilocalories) of a particular food while blindfolded (to ensure food appearance was not a factor), then dividing that number by how satiated the participants felt after eating white bread.
White bread serves as the baseline of 100. In other words, foods scoring higher than 100 are more satisfying than white bread and those under 100 are less satisfying. The satiety score was negatively correlated to the amount eaten by participants at a subsequent buffet.

± indicate uncertainty in the data.  For example 60 ± 12 means that there's a 95% chance the score is between 60-12 (48) and 60+12 (72), 60 being the highest probability assuming a bell curve.  In practice this means that if two foods have large uncertainty and have values close together then you don't really know which score is the higher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7000">'''Intersubjective verifiability''' is the capacity of a concept to be readily and accurately communicated between different individuals ("[[intersubjectivity|intersubjectively]]"), and to be [[reproducibility|reproduced]] under varying circumstances for the purposes of verification. It is a core principle of [[empiricism|empirical]], [[science|scientific]] investigation.&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;''Philosophy of Mind.'' Jaegwon Kim. 2005. Westview Press, p. 75.  ({{ISBN|0813342694}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;
''Verstehen: The Uses of Understanding in the Social Sciences.'' Michael Martin. 2000. Transaction Publishers, p. 64 ({{ISBN|1560004169}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ferment&gt;''Knowledge in Ferment:  Dilemmas in Science, Scholarship and Society.'' Adriaan in ’t Groen, Henk Jan de Jonge,
Eduard Klasen, Hilje Papma, and Piet van Slooten, Eds. 2007. Leiden University Press, p. 265 ({{ISBN|9789087280178}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are areas of belief that do not consistently employ intersubjective verifiability (e.g., many [[religion|religious]] claims), intersubjective verifiability is a near-universal way of arbitrating [[truth]] claims used by people everywhere. In its basic form, it can be found in colloquial expressions, e.g., "[[:wikt:from Missouri|I'm from Missouri. Show me!]]" or "[[:wikt:Seeing is believing|Seeing is believing]]". The scientific principle of replication of findings by investigators other than those that first reported the phenomenon is simply a more highly structured form of the universal principle of intersubjective verifiability.

==Subjective experience==
Each individual is a [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], and must [[subjectivity|subjective]]ly [[experience]] the physical world. Each subject has a different perspective and point of view on various aspects of the world. However, by sharing their comparable experiences intersubjectively, individuals may gain an increasingly similar understanding of the world. In this way, many different subjective experiences can come together to form intersubjective ones that are less likely to be prone to individual bias or gaps in knowledge.

While specific internal experiences are not intersubjectively verifiable, the existence of thematic patterns of internal experience can be intersubjectively verified.  For example, whether or not people are telling what they believe to be the truth when they make claims can only be known by the claimants.  However, we can intersubjectively verify that people almost universally experience discomfort (hunger) when they haven't had enough to eat.  We generally have only a crude ability to compare (measure) internal experiences.

==Congruence and incongruence==
When an external, public [[phenomenon]] is experienced and carefully described (in words or measurements) by one individual, other individuals can see if their experiences of the phenomenon "fit" the description. If they do, a sense of [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] between one subject and another occurs. This is the basis for a definition of what is true that is agreed upon by the involved parties. If the description does not fit the experience of one or more of the parties involved, incongruence occurs instead.

Incongruent contradictions between the experience and descriptions of different individuals can be caused by a number of factors. One common source of incongruence is the inconsistent use of language in the descriptions people use, such as the same words being used differently. Such [[semantics|semantic]] problems require more careful development and use of language.

Incongruence also arises from a failure to describe the phenomena well. In these cases, further development of the description, [[model (abstract)|model]], or [[theory]] used to refer to the phenomena is required.

A third form of incongruence arises when the descriptions do not conform to consensual (i.e., intersubjectively verifiable) experience, such as when the descriptions are faulty, incorrect, wrong, or inaccurate, and need to be replaced by more accurate descriptions, models, or theories.

==Versus belief based on faith==
{{Main|Science and religion}}

The contradiction between the truths derived from intersubjective verification and beliefs based on faith or on [[appeal to authority]] (e.g., many religious beliefs) forms the basis for the [[conflict between religion and science]].&lt;ref name=rel&amp;sci&gt;''The Marriage of Sense and Soul:  Integrating Science and Religion.'' Ken Wilbur. 1998. Random House ({{ISBN|0375500545}})&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been attempts to bring the two into congruence, and the modern, cutting edge of science, especially in [[physics]], seems to many observers to lend itself to a melding of religious experience and intersubjective verification of beliefs.  Some scientists have described religious worldviews—generally of a [[mystical]] nature—consistent with their understanding of science:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle ...

Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind ...

The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. The religion which is based on experience, which refuses dogmatism ...

There remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion. ([[Albert Einstein]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other scientists, who are committed to basing belief on intersubjective verification, have called for or predicted the development of a religion consistent with science.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A religion old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science, might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths. Sooner or later, such a religion will emerge. ([[Carl Sagan]], [[Pale Blue Dot]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evolutionary epic is probably the best myth we will ever have ...
The true evolutionary epic, retold as poetry, is as intrinsically ennobling as any religious epic. ([[Edward O. Wilson]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Responding to this apparent overlap between cutting edge science and mystical experience, in recent years, there have been overt efforts to formulate religious belief systems that are built on truth claims based upon intersubjective verifiability, e.g. [[Anthroposophy]], [[Yoism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yoism.org Yoism YOism site]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1368">'''Judenporzellan''' (literally "Jewish Porcelain") is a designation for inferior [[porcelain]] produced by the [[Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin|Royal Porcelain Factory]] owned by [[Frederick the Great]] in the late 18th century. In order to increase business, he decreed in 1769 that a tax on Jews in the form of coerced purchases from his factory would be levied on Jews in order to obtain marriage, death, business and other certificates and permits (Glueck 1998). Some accounts claim that the twenty porcelain monkeys belonging to the heirs of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] (1729–1786) are Judenporzellan (Hartmann 2006), although some authorities doubt the authenticity of these family stories based on chronology and provenance—at least one of the monkeys is of [[Meissen]] manufacture (Todd 2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2919">A '''Lady Literate in Arts''' ('''LLA''') qualification was offered by the [[University of St Andrews]] in Scotland for more than a decade before women were allowed to graduate in the same way as men, and it became popular as a kind of [[external degree]] for women who had studied through correspondence, or by attendance at non-university classes. In terms of academic standard, it was equivalent to the [[Master of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=N. Kemp|title=The Scots Philosophical Club|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|date=1950|volume=1|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.2307/2216495|jstor=2216495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1892 women were not admitted to [[Scottish universities]] and the LLA was the nearest qualification to a degree which was open to women in the country, although the [[University of Edinburgh]] offered certificates recognising achievement in classes organised by the [[Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women]], and in [[Glasgow]] [[University of Glasgow|Queen Margaret College]] was offering a university-equivalent education and awards. To obtain an LLA candidates had to pass examinations at a university-approved centre, which might be in Scotland or outwith the country.

Even after 1892, the LLA continued to be popular with women who wanted to study for an [[arts degree]] without needing to attend one particular institution for three or four years. Thousands of women received an LLA before it was discontinued in the 1930s.

[[William Angus Knight]] (1836–1916), Professor of [[Moral Philosophy]] at St Andrews between 1876 and 1903, was a supporter of [[female education]] and the main force behind the university's introduction of the LLA degree.

[[Helen Bannerman]], the children's writer, and suffragette [[Margaret Nevinson]] both had LLAs, as did the wartime nursing "heroine", [[Violetta Thurstan]].

[[File:Datuk shrine Pulau Pangkor 2007 006.jpg|thumb|250px|Shrine of Panglima Hijau, a ''Datuk'' or (in Malaysian Chinese) ''[[Na Tuk Kong]]'', a [[tutelary deity|god of the place]] on [[Pangkor Island]].]]

'''Malaysian folk religion''' refers to the [[animism|animistic]] and [[polytheism|polytheistic]] beliefs and practices that are still held by many in the [[Islam]]ic-majority country of [[Malaysia]]. Malaysian folk faith is practiced either openly or covertly depending on the type of rituals performed. 

Some forms of belief are not recognised by the government as a religion for statistical purposes although such practices are not outlawed. There is a deep interaction between the [[Chinese folk religion]] of the large [[Malaysian Chinese]] population, and the indigenous Malaysian folk religion.

==Overview==
{{see also|Datuk Keramat}}
[[File:Poh-San-Teng-2290.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Poh San Teng Temple]] is the oldest temple dedicated to the [[Hakka people|Hakka]]n ancestral figure of [[Tua Pek Kong]], reputedly one of the first settlers of [[Penang]]; it was built in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amazingmelaka.com/2011/12/sam-po-keng-temple/|title=Sam Po Keng Temple|work=AmazingMelaka.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are different types of Malaysian folk religion practised throughout the country. [[shamanism|Shamanic]] performances are held by people known as ''[[dukun]]s'', otherwise also known as ''dukun'' or ''pawang''. Most [[Orang Asli]] (indigenous people) are [[animism|animists]] and believe in spirits residing in certain objects. However, some have recently converted to mainstream religions due to state-sponsored Muslim [[dawah]] or [[evangelism]] by Christian missionaries.

In [[Indonesia]], indigenous religions are also practised by various [[Borneo|Bornean]] tribal groups. [[Chinese Indonesians]] generally practice folk religion, which is also animistic in nature. The word ''bomoh'' has been used throughout the country to describe any person with knowledge or power to perform certain spiritual rituals including traditional healing, and as a substitute for the word "shaman". Generally speaking, Indonesians have deep [[superstition|superstitious]] beliefs, especially more so in the rural areas.

==History==
[[File:Da Bogong Temple Kusu Island.JPG|thumb|[[Tua Pek Kong]] Temple on [[Kusu Island]], [[Singapore]].]]
Historically, before the arrival and spread of [[Islam]] in the 15th century, and the spread of [[Christianity]] from the 19th century, the inhabitants in the land were either [[Hindu]] or practiced indigenous faiths. In the peninsula, widespread [[Islamization]] is said to have begun in 1409 after [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] became [[Sultanate of Malacca|Sultan of Malacca]] and converted to [[Islam]] after marrying a princess from the [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate]]. Since then, other Sultanates in the Malay peninsula have adopted Islam. Also since then, and continuing after the independence of Malaysia, Islam played a central role in Malaysian society.

Similarly in East Malaysia, folk religion was widespread prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries from Europe. The practice of [[headhunting]] was quite common in these societies.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Susan, [http://www.seasite.niu.edu/crossroads/russell/headhunting.htm "Head-hunting in Southeast Asia"], ''Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Northern Illinois University''. Accessed 15 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sabah]], the [[Kadazan-Dusun]]s worshipped [[Kinoingan]], a rice deity, and celebrate [[Kaamatan]], the harvest festival, every year. During Kaamatan, there are certain rituals which has to be carried out by the high priestesses known as ''[[bobohizan]]s'' (or ''bobolian'' in the Bundu-Liwan dialect of [[Dusun language|Dusun]]). Today, most Kadazan-Dusuns have adopted Christianity, but some still celebrate Kaamatan. However, the number of bobohizans has tremendously dropped and this role is on the brink of extinction.&lt;ref name=dailyexpress&gt;[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=29782 "Set up knowledge academy on traditional healing: Pairin  "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234850/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=29782 |date=26 September 2007 }}, ''Daily Express'', 6 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Sarawak]], it has been said that the animism practised by the [[Iban people|Ibans]] and other related groups is the most developed, elaborated, and intellectualised in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Cavendish, Richard]], [[Man, Myth &amp; Magic (encyclopedia)|"Man, Myth &amp; Magic: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural (vol. 3)"]], New York: Marshall Cavendish Corp. (1970); [http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_29.html pg. 312]. Accessed 13 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Folk religious practice in East Malaysia is related to the religion of [[Kaharingan]] in [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]], which has been recognised as an official religion by the Indonesian government. However, the rituals involved are not entirely similar with variations depending on the ethnic subgroups which practices it.

==Shamanism and traditional healing==
{{main|Bomoh|Dukun|Pawang}}
The shamans ''bomohs'' or [[witch doctor]]s still practice their craft in Malaysia. The bomoh practice by Malays have been [[syncretism|integrated]] into Islam and is not forbidden.&lt;ref name=islamonline&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/english/Science/2002/10/article16.shtml "Malaysian Bomoh Practitioners: a Dying Breed"], ''Islam Online''. Accessed 12 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as [[traditional medicine|traditional healers]] and sometimes serve as an alternative to conventional modern medicine. However, the practice has sometimes been viewed negatively by Malaysian society as in some instances bomohs have the power to cast spells (jampi) and have used them on other people with ill effects. The number practitioners of bomohs has also dropped.&lt;ref name="islamonline" /&gt;

The bobohizans of Sabah are also shamans and are traditional healers. They also act as a [[mediumship|medium]] to communicate with spirits and play an important role in the rituals involved during Kaamatan, a harvest festival celebration of the [[Kadazan-Dusun]].

Recently there has been suggestions for the need and importance to preserve the practice of bomohs and other shamans as traditional healers and to complement or substitute conventional modern medicine.&lt;ref name="dailyexpress" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/printable.php?id=184419 "Bomoh And Malays Are Inseparable, Says Don"], ''Bernama'', 8 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysian Chinese Gods==
{{main|Na Tuk Kong|Tua Pek Kong|}}
[[File:Pagoda of Tua Pek Kong Temple.JPG|thumb|A pagoda of [[Tua Pek Kong Temple, Sibu]].]]
'''Tua Pek Kong''' ({{zh|c=大伯公|p=Dàbó Gōng}}, [[Hakka]]: Thai phak koong, [[Hokkien]]: Tuā-peh-kong, {{lang-ms|Topekong}}. lit. "grand uncle") is one of the pantheon of [[Shenism in Southeast Asia|Malaysian Chinese deities]]. He is believed to have arrived in [[Penang]] 40 years before [[Francis Light]] in 1746. 

Tua Pek Kong is said to have been a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] named Zhang Li ({{zh|c=张理}}). His [[Sumatra]]-bound boat was struck by wind and accidentally landed on [[Penang]] off Malaysia, which at that time had only 50 inhabitants. After his death, the local people began worshipping him and built the Tua Pek Kong temple there. Today Tua Pek Kong is worshipped by Malaysian Chinese throughout the country.

==Chinese folk religion==
{{Further|Shenism in Southeast Asia}}
Today most of the Chinese population in Malaysia are [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]], while the rest are [[Confucianism|Confucianist]], [[Daoism|Taoist]], Christians, and a small number of Muslims and Hindus. Most Chinese Malaysians still adhere to Chinese folk religion or [[veneration of the dead]] in tandem with mainstream religious practices. 

Some have stopped practising this religion after adopting a mainstream religion which prohibits animism or [[idolatry]]. As is the case in [[China]], the practice of this religion is not documented by the government for statistics purpose. Thus the number of followers in Malaysia can only be estimated.

[[image:Halichondria and Eribulin.jpg|thumb|''Halichondria'' produces the [[eribulin]] ('''Halaven''') precursor [[halichondrin B]]]]
For many years, traditional Western [[pharmacognosy]] focused on the investigation and identification of medically important plants and animals in the terrestrial environment, although many marine organisms were used in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]].  With the development of the open-circuit self-contained underwater breathing apparatus or [[Aqua-lung|SCUBA]] in the 1940s, some chemists turned to more pioneering work looking for new medicines in the marine environment.  In the United States, the road has been long for the first FDA approval of a drug directly from the sea, but in 2004, the approval of [[ziconotide]] isolated from a marine cone snail has paved the way for other marine-derived compounds moving through clinical trials.

With 79% of the earth’s surface covered by water, research into the chemistry of marine organisms is relatively unexplored and represents a vast resource for new medicines to combat major diseases such as [[cancer]], [[AIDS]] or [[malaria]].  Research typically focuses on sessile organisms or slow moving animals because of their inherent need for chemical defenses.  Standard research involves an extraction of the organism in a suitable solvent followed by either an assay of this crude extract for a particular disease target or a rationally guided isolation of new chemical compounds using standard [[chromatography]] techniques. 
Definition :- Marine Pharmacognosy is a sub branch of pharmacognosy which is mainly concerned with the naturally occurring substances of medicinal value from marine.generally the drugs are obtained from the marine species of bacteria,virus,algae,fungi and sponges,etc.

== Marine organisms as sources of natural products ==
Over 70% of the earth's surface is covered by oceans which contain 95% of the earth's biosphere.&lt;ref name=10.3390md201014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jimeno|first=J.|author2=Faircloth, G. |author3=Sousa-Faro, JM Fernández |author4=Scheuer, P. |author5=Rinehart, K. |title=New Marine Derived Anticancer Therapeutics ─ A Journey from the Sea to Clinical Trials|journal=Marine Drugs|year=2004|volume=2|issue=1|pages=14–29|doi=10.3390/md201014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was over 3500 million years ago that organisms first appeared in the sea. Over time, they have evolved many different mechanisms to survive the various harsh environments which include extreme temperatures, salinity, pressure,different levels of aeration and radiation, overcoming effects of mutation, and combating infection, fouling and overgrowth by other organisms.&lt;ref name=10.3390md201014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=10.1039B808743A&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skropeta|first=Danielle|title=Deep-Sea Natural Products|journal=Natural Product Reports|date=1 January 2008|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1131–66|doi=10.1039/B808743A|pmid=19030606|issn=0265-0568|url=https://works.bepress.com/skropeta/26/download/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations to survive the different environments could be by physical or chemical adaptation. Organisms with no apparent physical defense, like [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms, are believed to have evolved chemical defenses to protect themselves.&lt;ref name=10.3390md201014 /&gt; It is also believed that the compounds would have to be extremely potent due to the dilution effect of seawater. This has been described to be analogues to pheromones but with the purpose of repelling instead of attracting.&lt;ref name=pmid15332835 /&gt;  As well, predators have evolved chemical weapons in order to paralyze or kill prey. ''[[Conus magus]]'' is an example of a cone snail that has a poisoned harpoon-like projectile which it uses to paralyze prey like small fish.&lt;ref name=pmid12821301&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haefner|first=B|title=Drugs From the Deep: Marine Natural Products as Drug Candidates.|journal=Drug Discovery Today|date=Jun 15, 2003|volume=8|issue=12|pages=536–44|doi=10.1016/S1359-6446(03)02713-2|pmid=12821301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organisms, like the [[Viperfish]], are believed to attract small fish or prey by using its [[photophore]].&lt;ref name=Viperfish&gt;{{cite web|title=Creature of the Deep Sea|url=http://www.seasky.org/deep-sea/viperfish.html|publisher=Sea and Sky|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different marine organisms have been explored for bioactive compounds. Some vertebrate animals include fish, sharks and snakes. Some examples of invertebrates are sponges, coelenterates, tunicates, echinoderms, corals, algae, molluscs and bryozoans. Some microorganisms include bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name=pmid19903164&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=C |author2=Hsu, CH |author3=Wen, ZH |author4=Lin, CS|title=Anticancer drugs discovery and development from marine organism.|journal=Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry|year=2009|volume=9|issue=16|pages=1536–45|pmid=19903164|doi=10.2174/156802609789909803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==True Producer==
There is an ongoing debate on what organisms are the actual true producers of some compounds. About 40% of the biomass of sponges can be from microorganisms. It's not surprising that some compounds may actually be produced by symbiotic microorganisms rather than the host.

==Biological Diversity in Marine Environments==
Marine environments are considered more biologically diverse than terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=pmid12821301 /&gt;&lt;ref name=meps311179&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=JE|author2=Stachowicz, JJ|title=Why biodiversity is important to oceanography: potential roles of genetic, species, and trophic diversity in pelagic ecosystem processes|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|date=13 April 2006|volume=311|pages=179–189|doi=10.3354/meps311179|bibcode=2006MEPS..311..179D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-two different animal phyla are represented in the oceans of the 33 recognized phyla. Fifteen different phyla are represented only in marine environments, while only 1 is exclusively terrestrial.  Marine phyla also contain functionally unique organisms such as filter feeders and sessile organisms which have no terrestrial counterpart. Also, marine autotrophs are more diverse than their terrestrial counterparts. Marine autotrophs are believed to stem from at least 8 ancient clades while terrestrial organisms mainly stem from one clade, [[Embryophyte|Embyrophyta]].&lt;ref name=meps311179 /&gt; Marine environments may contain over 80% of the world's plant and animal species.&lt;ref name=pmid19903164 /&gt; The diversity of coral reefs can be extraordinary with species diversity reaching 1000 species per meter squared. The greatest marine tropical biodiversity is reported to be in the Indo-Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=Thakur2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thakur|first=N.L|author2=Thakur, A.N. |author3=Müller, W.E.G. |title=Marine Natural Products in Drug Discovery|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3e5f/84815d9c1a490c63e71027538abdd5da0096.pdf|journal=Natural Product Radiance|year=2005|volume=4|issue=6|pages=471–477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample Collection Technological Requirements==
Collecting marine samples can range from very simple and inexpensive to very complicated expensive. Samples from near or on shores are readily accessible via [[beach combing]], [[wading]] or [[snorkeling]].&lt;ref name=pmid15332835&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newman|first=David J.|author2=Cragg, Gordon M.|title=Marine Natural Products and Related Compounds in Clinical and Advanced Preclinical Trials|journal=Journal of Natural Products|date=1 August 2004|volume=67|issue=8|pages=1216–1238|doi=10.1021/np040031y|pmid=15332835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid10412202&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munro|first=M|title=The Discovery and Development of Marine Compounds with Pharmaceutical Potential|journal=Journal of Biotechnology|date=30 April 1999|volume=70|issue=1-3|pages=15–25|doi=10.1016/S0168-1656(99)00052-8|pmid=10412202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sample collection from deep water can be completed via [[dredging]] however, this is a very invasive technique which destroys the local habitat, does not allow for repeated sampling from the same location and compromises sample integrity. [[Box corer|Corers]] can be used for sediment sample collection from deep locations quickly, easily and inexpensively. [[SCUBA diving]] was introduced in the 1940s however,&lt;ref name=pmid15332835 /&gt;  it was not widely used  until it became popular in the 1970s. SCUBA diving is limited in the duration that divers can spend underwater when conducted from the surface. If prolonged dives were necessary, an underwater laboratory could be used. [[Aquarius (laboratory)|Aquarius]] is the only underwater laboratory dedicated to marine science.&lt;ref name=Aquarius&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aquarius Underwater Laboratory: America's "Inner Space" Station|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/diving/aquarius/aquarius.html|publisher=Ocean Explorer|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For sample collection from depths that cannot be achieved by SCUBA diving, [[submersible]]s may be used. Sample collection by submersibles can be extremely expensive with costs for a submersible, support ship, technicians and support staff ranging between $10,000 to $45,000 per day.&lt;ref name=Rates&gt;{{cite web|title=Ship Rates|url=http://www.mbari.org/dmo/ship_rates.htm|publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical Compound Isolation==
For the isolation of biologically active compounds from organisms, several different steps need to be completed. The different steps required to obtain a biologically active compound are: [[Extraction (chemistry)|Extraction]], [[Chromatography|chromatographic purification]], dereplication, [[structure elucidation]] and [[bioassay]] testing. The steps do not have to follow that particular order and many steps may be completed simultaneously. In the first step, the sample may be [[Trituration|triturated]] and [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extracted]] with a suitable solvent or [[Maceration (food)|macerated]]. Some solvents used are [[methanol]]:[[chloroform]], [[ethanol]], [[acetonitrile]], or others.  The purpose is to remove organic compounds that have a medium polarity which are considered more [[Druglikeness|"drug-like"]]. Ideally,polar compounds like [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, [[peptide]]s, [[Carbohydrate|sugars]] as well as very non-polar compounds like [[lipid]]s are left behind to simplify chromatography since they are not generally considered "drug-like".  Drying of the sample could be completed before extraction by [[Freeze-drying|lyophilisation]] to remove any excess water and therefore limit the amount of highly polar compounds extracted.

The next step depends on the methodology of individual laboratories. Bioassay-guided fractionation is a common method to find biologically active compounds. This involves testing the crude extract or preliminary fractions from chromatography in an assay or multiple assays, determining what fractions or crude extracts show activity in the specific assays, and further fractionating the active fractions or extracts. This step is than repeated where the new fractions are tested and the active fractions are further fractionated. This continues until the fraction only contains one compound. Dereplication is ideally performed as early as possible to determine if the active compound has been previously reported in order to prevent "rediscovering" a compound. This can be performed using [[Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|Liquid Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry]] (LC-MS) data or [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]] (NMR) data obtained in the biological assay-guided process and than comparing the information to that found in databases of previously reported compounds.

Structure elucidation is performed by using NMR data obtained of the compound and High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HR-MS) Data. [[Tandem mass spectrometry|Tandem Mass Spectrometry]] can also be useful, especially for large molecules like [[glycolipid]]s, [[protein]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s or [[peptide]]s. Completed characterization for publication purposes may require [[Infrared Spectroscopy|Infrared (IR)]], [[Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis)]], [[specific rotation]] and [[melting point]] data. Obtaining a [[crystal structure]] via [[X-ray crystallography]] can greatly accelerate and simplify structure elucidation however, obtaining crystals can be quite difficult.

There are many different bioassays available for testing. There are [[anticarcinogen|anticancer]], [[antimicrobial]], [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]], [[anti-inflammatory]], [[antiparasitic]], [[Hypolipidemic agent|anticholesterolemic]], and many other differ assays. For [[MTT assay]] and [[cytosol]]ic [[Lactate dehydrogenase|Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)]] release are common [[cytotoxicity]] or [[viability assay|cell viability assays]].

==Supply Issue==
A common problem that plagues drug development is obtaining a sustainable supply of the compound. Compounds isolated from invertebrates can be difficult to obtain in sufficient quantity for clinical trials. Synthesis is an alternate source of the compound of interest if the compound is simple otherwise, it is generally not a viable alternative. Aqua culture is another alternative if the organism is readily grown otherwise, it may not be good sustainable source of a compound. Also, the small quantity the compound is usually found in from organisms makes this alternative even more expensive. For example, ET-743 can be isolated from the tunicate ''Ecteinascidia turbinata'' with a yield of 2 g per ton.&lt;ref name=pmid15332835 /&gt;  This would require thousands of tons of tunicate to be grown and extracted to produce the kilograms of ET-743 that would be required for the treatment of thousands of people. Some success has been had in producing compounds of interest from microorganisms. Microorganisms can be used as a sustainable source for the production of compounds of interest. They can also be used for the production of intermediates so that semisynthesis can be used to produce the final compound. This has been achieved for ET-743 with the production of the intermediate Safracin B from ''Pseudomonas fluoresens'' and the subsequent semisynthesis into ET-743. This is currently the industrial production method for the production of Yondelis.&lt;ref name=DOI101039&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cuevas|first=Carmen|author2=Francesch, Andrés|title=Development of Yondelis® (trabectedin, ET-743). A semisynthetic process solves the supply problem|journal=Natural Product Reports|date=1 January 2009|volume=26|issue=3|pages=322|doi=10.1039/b808331m}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12892">'''Microbial inoculants''' also known as '''soil inoculants''' are agricultural amendments that use beneficial [[endophytes]] (microbes) to promote plant health. Many of the microbes involved form symbiotic relationships with the target crops where both parties benefit ([[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]). While microbial inoculants are applied to improve plant nutrition, they can also be used to promote plant growth by stimulating plant hormone production (Bashan &amp; Holguin, 1997; Sullivan, 2001).

Research into the benefits of inoculants in agriculture extends beyond their capacity as [[biofertilizer]]s. Microbial inoculants can induce [[systemic acquired resistance]] (SAR) of crop species to several common crop diseases (provides resistance against pathogens). So far SAR has been demonstrated for powdery mildew (''Blumeria graminis'' f. sp. ''hordei'', Heitefuss, 2001), take-all (''Gaeumannomyces graminis'' var. ''tritici'', Khaosaad ''et al.'', 2007), leaf spot (''Pseudomonas syringae'', Ramos Solano ''et al.'', 2008) and root rot (''[[Fusarium]] culmorum'', Waller ''et al.'' 2005).
&lt;!--*Freeing up soil nutrients for plant use.

*Acting as [[antagonistic organisms]] against plant pathogens.--&gt;

==Bacterial==

===Rhizobacterial inoculants===
The [[rhizobacteria]] commonly applied as inoculants include nitrogen-fixers and phosphate-solubilisers which enhance the availability of the macronutrients nitrogen and phosphorus to the host plant. Such bacteria are commonly referred to as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR).

====Nitrogen-fixing bacteria====
The most commonly applied rhizobacteria are ''[[Rhizobium]]'' and closely related genera. ''Rhizobium'' are [[nitrogen-fixing]] bacteria that form symbiotic associations within nodules on the roots of [[legumes]]. This increases host nitrogen nutrition and is important to the cultivation of soybeans, chickpeas  and many other leguminous crops. For non-leguminous crops, ''Azospirillum'' has been demonstrated to be beneficial in some cases for nitrogen fixation and plant nutrition (Bashan &amp; Holguin, 1997).

For cereal crops, diazotrophic rhizobacteria have increased plant growth,&lt;ref&gt;Galal, Y. G. M., El-Ghandour, I. A., Osman, M. E. &amp; Abdel Raouf, A. M. N. (2003), The e ffect of inoculation by mycorrhizae and rhizobium on the growth and yield of wheat in relation to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization as assessed by 15n techniques, Symbiosis, 34(2), 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt; grain yield (Caballero-Mellado ''et al.'', 1992), nitrogen and phosphorus uptake,&lt;ref&gt;Galal, Y. G. M., El-Ghandour, I. A., Osman, M. E. &amp; Abdel Raouf, A. M. N. (2003), The e ffect of inoculation by mycorrhizae and rhizobium on the growth and yield of wheat in relation to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization as assessed by 15n techniques, Symbiosis, 34(2), 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt; and nitrogen (Caballero-Mellado ''et al.'', 1992), phosphorus (Caballero-Mellado ''et al.'', 1992; Belimov ''et al.'', 1995) and potassium content (Caballero-Mellado ''et al.'', 1992). Rhizobacteria live in root nodes, and are associated with legumes.

====Phosphate-solubilising bacteria====
To improve phosphorus nutrition, the use of phosphate-solubilising bacteria (PSB) such as ''Agrobacterium radiobacter'' has also received attention (Belimov ''et al.'', 1995a; 1995b; Singh &amp; Kapoor, 1999). As the name suggests, PSB are free-living bacteria that break down inorganic soil phosphates to simpler forms that enable uptake by plants.

==Fungal inoculants==
Several different fungal inoculants (typically referred to as [[mycorrhizae]]) have been explored for their benefits to plant nutrition. Fungal inoculation has been observed to
benefit plant success and improve soil quality. The most commonly investigated fungi for this purpose are the [[arbuscular mycorrhizae]] (AM or AMF). [[Ectomycorrhizae]] are often symbiotic with coniferous species. Other [[endophytic]] fungi, such as ''Piriformis indica'' can also be beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, F., Achatz, B., Baltruschat, H., Fodor, J., Becker, K., Fischer, M., Heier, T., Hückelhoven, R., Neumann, C., von Wettstein, D. and Franken, P., 2005. The endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica reprograms barley to salt-stress tolerance, disease resistance, and higher yield. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102(38), pp.13386-13391.&lt;/ref&gt;
    
===Fungal partners===

Fungal inoculation alone can benefit host
plants. Inoculation paired with other amendments can further improve
conditions. Arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation combined with [[compost]] is a
common household amendment for personal gardens, agriculture, and nurseries. It
has been observed that this pairing can also promote microbial functions in
soils that have been affected by [[mining]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, J., Caravaca, F., Azcón, R., Díaz, G. and Roldán, A. (2015). The combination of compost addition and arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation produced positive and synergistic effects on the phytomanagement of a semiarid mine tailing. Science of the Total Environment, 514, pp.42-48.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain fungal partners do best in specific
[[ecotones]] or with certain crops. [[Arbuscular mycorrhizal]] inoculation paired with plant
growth promoting bacteria resulted in a higher yield and quicker maturation in
upland rice patties.&lt;ref&gt;Diedhiou, A., Mbaye, F., Mbodj, D., Faye, M., Pignoly, S., Ndoye, I., Djaman, K., Gaye, S., Kane, A., Laplaze, L., Manneh, B. and Champion, A. (2016). Field Trials Reveal Ecotype-Specific Responses to Mycorrhizal Inoculation in Rice. PLOS ONE, 11(12), p.e0167014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maize growth improved after an amendment of
arbuscular mycorrhizae and [[biochar]]. This amendment can also decrease
[[cadmium]] uptake by crops.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, L., Li, J., Yue, F., Yan, X., Wang, F., Bloszies, S. and Wang, Y. (2018). Effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation and biochar amendment on maize growth, cadmium uptake and soil cadmium speciation in Cd-contaminated soil. Chemosphere, 194, pp.495-503.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===

The effects of mycorrhizal inoculation include increased nutrient uptake and [[seedling]] establishment. Other effects
include increases in [[salinity]] tolerance,&lt;ref&gt;Hirrel, M.C. and Gerdemann, J.W., 1980. Improved Growth of Onion and Bell Pepper in Saline Soils by Two Vesicular-Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi 1. Soil Science Society of America Journal, 44(3), pp.654-655.&lt;/ref&gt; drought tolerance,&lt;ref&gt;Ferrazzano, S. and Williamson, P. (2013). Benefits of mycorrhizal inoculation in reintroduction of endangered plant species under drought conditions. Journal of Arid Environments, 98, pp.123-125.&lt;/ref&gt; and resistance to trace metal toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;
Firmin, S., Labidi, S., Fontaine, J., Laruelle, F., Tisserant, B., Nsanganwimana, F., Pourrut, B., Dalpé, Y., Grandmougin, A., Douay, F., Shirali, P., Verdin, A. and Lounès-Hadj Sahraoui, A. (2015). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculation protects Miscanthus×giganteus against trace element toxicity in a highly metal-contaminated site. Science of the Total Environment, 527-528, pp.91-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inoculant usage===

Fungal inoculants can be used with or without additional amendments in private gardens, homesteads, agricultural production, native nurseries, and land restoration projects.

==Composite inoculants==
The combination of strains of Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria has been shown to benefit rice (''Oryza'', Nguyen ''et al.'' (2002)) and barley.&lt;ref&gt;Belimov, A. A., Kojemiakov, A. P. &amp; Chuvarliyeva, C. V. (1995a) Interaction between barley and mixed cultures of nitrogen fixing and phosphate-solubilising bacteria. Plant and Soil, 173, 29-37.&lt;/ref&gt; The main benefit from dual inoculants is increased plant nutrient uptake, from both soil and fertiliser (Bashan ''et al.'', 2004; Belimov ''et al.'' 1995a). Multiple strain inoculants have also been demonstrated to increase total nitrogenase activity compared to single strain inoculants, even when only one strain is diazotrophic (Lippi ''et al.'', 1992; Khammas &amp; Kaiser, 1992, Belimov ''et al.'' 1995a).

PGPR and arbuscular mycorrhizae in combination can be useful in increasing wheat growth in nutrient poor soil&lt;ref&gt;Singh, S. &amp; Kapoor, K. K. (1999) Inoculation with phosphate-solubilising microorganisms and a vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus improves dry matter yield and nutrient uptake by wheat grown in sandy soil. Biology and Fertility of Soils, 28, 139-144.&lt;/ref&gt; and improving nitrogen-extraction from fertilised soils.&lt;ref&gt;Galal, Y. G. M., El-Ghandour, I. A., Osman, M. E. &amp; Abdel Raouf, A. M. N. (2003), The effect of inoculation by mycorrhizae and rhizobium on the growth and yield of wheat in relation to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization as assessed by 15n techniques, Symbiosis, 34(2), 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt; In salinised soils, Rabie (2005) found that inoculating AM-infected ''Vicia faba'' plants with ''Azospirillum brasilense'' amplified the beneficial effects of AM inoculation.

'''Modern [[rhetoric]]''' has gone through many changes since the age of ancient Rome and Greece to fit the societal demands of the time.  [[Kenneth Burke]], who is largely credited for defining the notion of modern rhetoric, described modern rhetoric as, "Rooted in an essential function of language itself, a function that is wholly realistic, and is continually born anew; the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols."&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. A Rhetoric of Motives. London, England: University of California Press, Ltd, 1950. Print. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;   Burke’s theory of rhetoric directed attention to the division between classical and modern rhetoric.  The intervention of outside academic movements, such as structuralism, semiotics, and critical theory, made important contributions to a modern sense of rhetorical studies.

==Support and criticism==
Some critics disagree with a changing definition of rhetoric, including [[Brian Vickers]], who argued that modern rhetoric demeans classical rhetoric: "It first reduces its scope, and then applies it to purposes that it never dreamt of."&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, Brian. "The Atrophy of Modern Rhetoric, Vico to De Man." Rhetorica 6.1 (1988): 21-56. Web. 15 February 2010. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;   He also critiques Burke’s writing on modern rhetoric, saying it is, "A [rhetorical] system that rearranges the components of classical rhetoric so idiosyncratically as to be virtually unusable."&lt;ref&gt;Vickers 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
	Kenneth Burke was heavily influenced by modern social stratification and the way which symbols allow social unification and polarization, particularly in A Rhetoric of Motives.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Don. "Marxist Influences on the Rhetorical Theory of Kenneth Burke." Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric 7.4 (1974): 217-233. Web. 9 April 2010. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;   Burke sees these social changes as a social drama, acted out in rhetorical performance.  Burke also employs Freudian principles in his works on modern rhetoric. He highlights the importance of modern psychology, where identification of the audience plays a key role.  The principle of identification, as Burke explains, is the speaker appealing to the audience’s opinions and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Burke. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;   Identification is crucial for modern rhetorical study and the principal of [[constitutive rhetoric]].

==Other influences==
A significant event, deemed the "[[linguistic turn]]," drastically changed how modern rhetoric was theorized and practiced.  The linguistic turn linked different areas of study by their common concern for symbol-systems in shaping the way humans interpret the world and create meaning.  Interpreting the world and creating meaning is the basis for Richard E. Vatz's "Myth of the Rhetorical Situation," Philosophy and Rhetoric, Summer: 1973 and The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion, Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013.  This is a change from the traditional understanding of words being labels for ideas and concepts, to the notion of language constituting social reality.

The [[public sphere]] was studied by scholars such as [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Gerard A. Hauser]].  Jürgen Habermas described the public sphere as the sphere of private people coming together as a public that is accessible by all, to openly discuss the general rules governing society.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society. 2nd ed. The MIT Press, 1991. Print. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;   Gerard Hauser described the public sphere differently in terms of rhetoric.  Hauser explained it to be formed by the dialogue surrounding issues, emphasizing how the members of society that engage in the dialogue were the components of the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, Gerald. Vernacular Dialogue and the Rhetoricality of Public Opinion. Communication Monographs, 1998. Print. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;   The public sphere grows by attaining more members who will engage in the vernacular.  Hauser’s definition of the rhetorical public sphere still shares the notion of open debate and accessibility, assuming that the participants are actively engaged in the discourse.

==Conclusion==
Some scholars that support the notion of modern rhetoric offer normative models that differ from classical rhetoric.  Modern rhetorical study, some say, should stress two-way communication based on mutual trust and understanding to improve the speaker’s ability to persuade.&lt;ref&gt;Ede, Lisa, and [[Andrea Lunsford]]. "On Distinctions Between Classical and Modern Rhetoric." Educational Resources Information Center (1982): 1-29. Web. 17 February 2010. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   Acknowledging that all communication and symbols are rhetorical, scholars of the field also call for a continued expansion of the objects of study, in order to improve communicative practices and bring about more egalitarian speech.

==Description==
[[File:Etruscan chariot wheel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Close up on the wheel of the chariot.]]
The Monteleone chariot was part of a [[chariot burial]], containing the remains of two human corpses, along with two drinking cups. Measuring 131&amp;nbsp;cm in height and designed to be drawn by two horses, the chariot itself is constructed of wood covered with hammered bronze plates and carved ivory decoration. The bronze plates are decorated with Homeric iconography; the main panel depicts [[Achilles]] being handed his armor by his mother, [[Thetis]]. The chariot's frame and plating is additionally adorned with animals and mythological creatures, rendered in detail. The chariot's decorations would also have included inlaid amber and other exotic materials, but only the bronze and ivory decorations have survived. The chariot's wheels have nine [[spoke]]s (rather than the classical Greek four, the Egyptian six, or the Assyrian and Persian eight; excavated chariots from Celtic burials have up to twelve spokes).

Contemporary curators at the Museum had long suspected that the chariot's original 1903 reconstruction was not historically accurate. In 1989, under the direction of Italian archaeologist [[Adriana Emiliozzi]], the Metropolitan Museum began a five-year reexamination and restoration of the chariot. During the restoration, it was discovered that the chariot had in fact been originally assembled incorrectly; additionally, evidence was uncovered indicating that the chariot, previously thought to have seen little actual use, had in fact been involved in a serious accident at some point during its life.&lt;ref name=nytimes1&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=A More Precise Version of Your Chariot Awaits|publisher=The New York Times|date=2007-03-29|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/arts/design/29char.html?ex=1332820800&amp;en=accf307e2331452e&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly restored chariot's reinstallation was scheduled as part of the major renovations of the Metropolitan Museum's Greek and Roman galleries, opening to the public on April 20, 2007.

==History==
[[File:Bronze chariot inlaid with ivory MET DP137936.jpg|thumb|250px|Monteleone chariot]]
[[File:Bronze chariot inlaid with ivory MET DP137946.jpg|thumb|250px|]]
It was found in 1902 in [[Monteleone di Spoleto]], near [[Spoleto]] in the [[Provinces_of_Italy#Kingdom_of_Italy|province]] of [[Umbria]], by a farmer named Isidoro Vannozzi who inadvertently unearthed it while digging a wine cellar or basement barn. Its history from that time is the subject of controversy. According to some accounts, Vannozzi hid the chariot in his barn, concerned that the authorities might confiscate it, and later sold it to two Frenchmen in exchange for two cows. Another account, related by Vannozzi's son Giuseppe, holds that the chariot was immediately sold as scrap metal, and the proceeds from the sale used to buy roof tiles.&lt;ref name=nytimes2&gt;{{cite news|last=Povoledo|first=Elisabetta|title=Umbrian Umbrage: Send Back That Etruscan Chariot|publisher=The New York Times|date=2007-04-05|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/arts/design/05char.html?ex=1333425600&amp;en=2b186de026816a09&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing hands several times after its initial sale, the chariot was eventually purchased in Paris by [[J. P. Morgan]], who sent it to the Metropolitan Museum in 1903, where its first restoration took place.

Because the museum's acquisition of the chariot in 1903 predates by six years Italy's first laws restricting export of items that carry "cultural and artistic values," the chariot's sale was legal at the time of purchase, though debated by the contemporary press.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patrimoniosos1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Galli|first=Paola|title=Cultural assets for sale. A comment on the Italian Code for the cultural assets and landscape|date=2005-05-03|url=http://www.patrimoniosos.it/rsol.php?op=getintervento&amp;id=52|accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, the [[comune]] of Monteleone began a campaign aimed at recuperating the chariot from the Met; their efforts, however, did not receive the backing of the Italian government. The Metropolitan Museum has responded that the chariot was "purchased in good faith".&lt;ref name="nytimes2" /&gt;  A full-size copy was made in the mid-20th century, which is on display in Monteleone.

The '''National Institute for Biological Standards and Control''' ('''NIBSC''') is a global leader in the field of biological standardisation. It is a centre of the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)]]. It is responsible for developing and producing over 90% of the biological international standards in use around the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Institute is the UK's [[Official Medicines Control Laboratory]] (OMCL), responsible for independent regulatory testing of biological medicines within the framework of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nibsc.org/about_us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is also host to the UK Stem Cell Bank and a key UK research centre in the field of pandemic flu. It is situated just west of junction 23 of the [[M25 motorway|M25]]. Half of the building is in Ridge and the eastern half is in the parish of [[South Mimms]].

==History==
The NIBSC began work in May 1972. The National Biological Standards Board was formed in 1975 at the NIMR in [[Mill Hill]]. A site was selected and the new £25m building opened in 1987, although it was officially opened in 1988. It has 4,500 square metres of laboratories. NIBSC employs around 300 staff, 200 of whom are scientists.

In February 2008, it featured in a thirty-minute programme on [[BBC Radio 4]] in the ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/secretscience/ Secret Science]'' two-part series (the other programme was about the [[Health Protection Agency]]'s [[Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response]] at [[Porton Down]]).

In April 2009, NIBSC became centre of the UK [[Health Protection Agency|Health Protection Agency (HPA)]]. In April 2013, the NIBSC left the HPA and was merged with the UK’s [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)]].

==Function==
It produces over 90% of the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]'s International Standards for substances such as antibiotics, enzymes, [[Antibody|antibodies]] and hormones, and methods such as [[blood transfusion]]s. These standards form a vital part of global health efforts and pharmaceutical research, and over 10,000 standards a month are shipped worldwide. 
It is the UK's Official Medicines Control Laboratory.

==Facilities==
New buildings for the [http://www.ukstemcellbank.org.uk UK Stem Cell Bank] (which has been on the site [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=188865&amp;sectioncode=26 since] May 19, 2004 and was Europe's first stem cell bank) and [http://www.nibsc.org/flu_site/index.html Influenza Resource Centre] were built on the site in a £12m development by [[Morgan Sindall Group|Morgan Ashurst]] and opened in December 2009.

'''NeuroFocus, Inc.''' was an American multinational [[neuromarketing]] company that was acquired by Nielsen in May 2011. Since that acquisition, Nielsen has acquired additional neuroscience companies and named the consolidated business unit Nielsen [[Consumer neuroscience]].

==Corporate history==

===Founding===

Dr. A.K. Pradeep founded Neurofocus in 2005 in Berkeley, CA. He stated that he started NeuroFocus as a way to provide answers to his marketing clients who were frustrated by their inability to accurately predict consumer responses. According to Pradeep, his moment of inspiration arose from a conversation with a neuroscientist about his studies of the brains of patients with [[Attention Deficit Disorder]] or [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and those suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Pradeep said that it was due to this conversation that he realized the link between neuroscience and marketing. He postulated that when viewing a product, customers experience some of the same neurological effects that his neuroscientist neighbor studied.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Smith, Rick (September 2009). ‘‘The Leap: How 3 Simple Changes can Propel Your Career from Good to Great’’’. New York: Portfolio. pp.134-139. {{ISBN|978-1-59184-256-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing companies’ frustrations could therefore be addressed by referring to cognitive neuroscience’s technology and methodology. Neurological studies could help marketers discover if the customer would pay attention to and remember their product.

===Growth and Acquisition===
In February 2008, [[The Nielsen Company]] became a strategic investor in NeuroFocus. Also in 2008, NeuroFocus expanded internationally into Asia, and specifically into Korea and Japan. In March 2009, NeuroFocus ventured into Europe, acquiring its competitor, Neuroco.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neurofocus.com/news/neuroco.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Within that same year, NeuroFocus opened its European headquarters in London. NeuroFocus also established locations in Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Seoul, [[Bogotá]], New York, and Dallas. In March 2010, NeuroFocus announced the addition of [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Eric Kandel]] to NeuroFocus’ advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;http://neurofocus.com/pdfs/ERIC_KANDEL_RELEASE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

NeuroFocus’ premise was that it could provide key insights about customers that traditional marketing techniques could not. NeuroFocus utilized [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[eye tracking]], and [[biometrics]] such as [[galvanic skin response]] (GSR) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=80987&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain insights into customers’ conscious and [[subconscious]] feelings, emotions, and preferences.&lt;ref name="businesstodayegypt.com"&gt;http://www.businesstodayegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=8837&lt;/ref&gt;  NeuroFocus stated that these insights were more accurate than traditional [[focus group]] responses as they were gleaned directly from the brain and therefore uncontaminated by [[cognitive bias]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92768079&lt;/ref&gt; NeuroFocus also claimed that its methodology allowed it to access the subconscious desires that cannot be expressed by the consumer.&lt;ref name="businesstodayegypt.com"/&gt;

NeuroFocus claimed to provide its clients with a prediction of effectiveness through specific scores on the attention, emotion, and memory metrics as well as its derived metrics of novelty, awareness, and purchase intent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cablefax.com/cfp/cfp/just_in/37342.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/does-emotionally-powerful-programming-prime-advertising-effectiveness/&lt;/ref&gt; NeuroFocus reportedly determined these metrics based on the brain wave data collected while consumers viewed client products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/19/BUNF10MEPI.DTL&lt;/ref&gt;  NeuroFocus stated that it could address a client’s needs for insights into its brand, products, packaging, in-store marketing, and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neurofocus.com/pdfs/Insidethemind_DDi.pdf?vnu_content_id=1003783738 Display and Design Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrsa.com.au/index.cfm?a=detail&amp;eid=222&amp;id=4702&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, NeuroFocus announced that it had developed a 3D [[virtual reality simulation]] store research tool that would enable clients to test product designs and store layouts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.research-live.com/news/technology/neurofocus-goes-virtual-with-new-3d-store-research-tool/4002875.article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/breakthrough-3d-virtual-reality-based-in-store-research-neurofocus-introduces-n-matrix-3dtm-system-95604464.html&lt;/ref&gt; None of the metrics or methods used by NeuroFocus were available for peer review or replicability studies, arising some quiestioning about the actual meaning of their metrics.

NeuroFocus stated that it provided services to a growing number of [[Fortune 500]] companies,&lt;ref&gt;http://chiefmarketer.com/crm/1027-neuromarketing-loyalty-brain/&lt;/ref&gt; commissioning specialized on-site “Neurolabs” to those clients who desired a lab to perform constant testing tailored to their individual needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.research-live.com/news/technology/ae-television-networks-orders-neurolab/4002728.article&lt;/ref&gt;

NeuroFocus was acquired by Nielsen in May 2011. In 2013, two years post the acquisition by Nielsen, Dr. A.K. Pradeep assumed the role and title of Chief Provocateur of Nielsen. Pradeep resigned from the company on June 2, 2014. On May 27, 2015, Nielsen completed an acquisition of Innerscope Research and named the consolidated business unit Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience. Dr. Carl Marci was named Chief Neuroscientist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerdooley/2015/06/03/nielsen-doubles-down-on-neuro/#5145dff306cd&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Alchemy Institute''' was a research center that did pioneering investigation into [[organic agriculture]], [[aquaculture]], and [[bioshelter]] design between 1969 and 1991. It was founded by [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], Nancy Jack Todd, and William McLarney. Its purpose was to research human support systems of food, water, and shelter and to completely rethink how these systems were designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Alastair|title=Remembering Jay Baldwin, experimental geodesic dome champion - Archpaper.com|url=https://archpaper.com/2018/04/remembering-jay-baldwin/|accessdate=18 May 2018|work=archpaper.com|date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of the Institute==

The New Alchemy Institute was founded on a {{convert|12|acre|m2|adj=on}}, former dairy farm in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Hatchville]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Cape Cod]]. Their stated aim was to do research on behalf of the planet: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Among our major tasks is the creation of ecologically derived human support systems - [[renewable energy]], agriculture [[aquaculture]], housing and landscapes. The strategies we research emphasize a minimal reliance on [[fossil fuel]]s and operate on a scale accessible to individuals, families and small groups. It is our belief that ecological and social transformations must take place at the lowest functional levels of society if humankind is to direct its course towards a greener, saner world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our programs are geared to produce not riches, but rich and stable lives, independent of world fashion and the vagaries of international economics. The New Alchemists work at the lowest functional level of society on the premise that society, like the planet itself, can be no healthier than the components of which it is constructed. The urgency of our efforts is based on our belief that the industrial societies which now dominate the world are in the process of destroying it." (Fall 1970, Bulletin of the New Alchemists. [http://www.thegreencenter.net/newalchemy.html])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Areas of research==

===Bioshelters===

A [[bioshelter]] is a solar greenhouse that is managed as a self-contained [[ecosystem]].  The groupings of plants, animals, soil and insects are selected so that closed loops of life cycles, materials, water, and energy are created, and require minimal inputs from outside the system.  They emulate natural rhythms of growth and cycling of nutrients.

New Alchemy built several bioshelters:

* "The Ark" located at the property in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Hatchville, Massachusetts]], United States
* "The Ark" located at [[Little Pond, Prince Edward Island|Spry Point, Prince Edward Island]], Canada
* others

===Organic agriculture===
New Alchemy investigated the practices of organic agriculture for both field crops, and greenhouse growing. They researched intensive gardening, biological pest control, cover cropping, irrigation using fish pond water, perennial food crops, and tree crops.

===Aquaculture===
New Alchemy experimented with growing edible fish  in ponds in the bioshelters. The solar aquaculture ponds were  above-ground, translucent tanks. The fertile pond water was used for irrigating the crops in the greenhouses. This proved to be a successful way to raise edible fish, floating hydroponic crops, and irrigated greenhouse food crops.

==Ideological basis==
The scientists working at New Alchemy were determined to rethink how human support systems were designed. They looked to nature as the ultimate designer, using careful observation of natural cycles and processes as the template for creating truly sustainable systems.

==Publications==
The research conducted at New Alchemy was documented in a series of journals and technical bulletins.  A complete list is available at: [http://www.thegreencenter.net New Alchemy Institute]

The '''Parque Arqueológico do Solstício''' (Solstice Archaeological Park), referred to in academic sources as AP-CA-18, is an archaeological park located in [[Amapá]] state, [[Brazil]], near the city of [[Calçoene]]. It contains a [[megalith]]ic [[stone circle]], colloquially known as the '''Amazon Stonehenge''', consisting of 127 blocks of granite, each up to 4 meters tall, standing upright in a circle measuring over 30 meters in diameter at the bank of the Rego Grande river on a hilltop. Archaeologists believe that this site was built by indigenous peoples for astronomical, ceremonial, or burial purposes, and likely a combination. The function of this megalithic site is unknown, much like other sites such as [[Stonehenge]], a much older site in Great Britain.

==Discovery==
The first reports of the Rego Grande site are from naturalist [[Emilio Goeldi]] in the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}} Locals have called the site "Tropical Stonehenge" for some time. In 2005, archaeologists began excavation of the site after it was reported by a geologist during a socioeconomic study.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}}

==Findings==
Though the stones have not been submitted to dating techniques, [[carbon-dating]] of pottery sherds has placed the site at 500 – 2000 years old.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}} The origin of these granite blocks has yet to be studied as well. In certain Megalithic sites, such as Stonehenge in [[Wiltshire, England]], the blocks were moved to the site from some distance away. Archaeologists are not yet sure whether the Rego Grande site were also brought from elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}}

On the [[winter solstice]] of December 21, the [[shortest day]] of the year in the northern hemisphere, the shadow of one of the blocks disappears when the sun is directly above it.&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt; The rock seems to be placed at angle so that the shadow is possibly small throughout the day.&lt;ref name="wonderm"&gt;{{cite web

They believe the site was made by a sophisticated indigenous culture.&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt; One of the stones has a circular hole carved into it. During the winter solstice, the sun shines directly though this hole onto another rock for an extended amount of time,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} supporting the idea that Amazon Stonehenge was used as an astronomical site.

Apart from the circular hole the granite stones that make up Amazon Stonehenge appear irregularly shaped.  Whether this irregularity reflects primitive mining technology or holds clues regarding potential uses of the site has not yet been determined.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/world/americas/brazil-amazon-megaliths-stonehenge.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

During the excavations two large pits have been found, both approximately 1.5 – 2 meters deep and covered by large stone slabs. During excavation, shards of pottery, red clay, and ash from human remains were found. Three intact urns were found in a triangular formation at the bottom of one pit and more intact urns, as well as a few lids were found in the second. Remnants of cremated human remains have been found with these shards and in the urns, suggesting that these pits were either burial sites or that select human remains were buried here because they were significant. Shards of bowls and other pieces of pottery have been found in smaller pits near by. These bowls, lids, and urns have been found created in the shapes of animals and human-like figurines.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mongabay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite news

==Significance ==
Evidence has been found near the Rego Grande site and all over the Amazon to suggest that the indigenous people of the region lived in a complex societies that involved both agriculture and a close relationship with the natural environment around them.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}}

There are also several other megalithic sites in Brazil that follow the curves of the Rego Grande river. The fact that these Megalithic sites seem to follow such a pattern suggests that Amazon Stonehenge may have been used as either a ceremonial site and that its structure and cultural significance were shared amount different indigenous communities in pre-Columbian Brazil.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}}

Despite not knowing the exact use of the Rego Grande site, most scientist agree that it alludes to a pre-Columbian society that was much more complex than previously thought.{{Citation needed|date= December 2016}}

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7905">In [[linguistics]], especially within [[generative grammar]], '''phi features''' (denoted with the Greek letter [[Phi|φ]] 'phi') are the semantic features of [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]],  [[Grammatical gender|gender]], and [[Grammatical case|case]], as encoded in pronominal agreement with [[nouns]] and [[pronouns]] (the latter are said to consist only of phi-features, containing no lexical head). Several other features are included in the set of phi-features, such as the categorical features ±N (nominal) and ±V (verbal), which can be used to describe [[lexical category|lexical categories]] and case features.&lt;ref name="Kerstens, Johan"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cJagGHOlKDUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1 The syntax of number, person, and gender: a theory of phi-features], Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., 1993, p.2"&lt;/ref&gt;

Phi-features are often thought of as the "silent" features that exist on lexical heads (or, according to some theories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/885337994|title=The universal structure of categories : towards a formal typology|last=Martina,|first=Wiltschko,|isbn=9781316004159|location=Cambridge|oclc=885337994}}&lt;/ref&gt;, within the syntactic structure) that are understood for number, gender, person or reflexivity. Due to their silent nature, phi-features are often only understood if someone is a native speaker of a language, or if the translation includes a gloss of all these features. Many languages exhibit a [[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]] phenomenon which means that they rely on other lexical categories to determine the phi-features of the lexical heads.

== Predicate-Argument Agreement ==
[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/309976|title=Aspects of the theory of syntax|last=Noam.|first=Chomsky,|date=1965|publisher=M.I.T. Press|isbn=0262530074|location=Cambridge|oclc=309976}}&lt;/ref&gt; first proposed that the N node in a clause carries with it all the features to include person, number and gender. In [[English language|English]], we rely on nouns to determine the phi-features of a word, but other languages rely on inflections of the different parts of speech to determine person, number and gender of the nominal phrases to which they refer. Mainly '''verbs''' and '''adjectives''' are responsible for bearing inflections which signal the phi-features of a particular subject or object. Verbs appear to be responsible for carrying the most features and tend to carry person, number and gender agreements cross-linguistically for both subjects and objects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511619830|title=The Syntax of Agreement and Concord|last=Baker|first=Mark C.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511619830|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Adjectives also carry phi-features in some languages, they tend to agree in number and gender but rarely for person &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511619830|title=The Syntax of Agreement and Concord|last=Baker|first=Mark C.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511619830|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Person ===
In English, person agreement is understood in the pronoun or noun overtly, while the verb carries the agreement marker to agree with the person phi-features on the Noun. For English, there is only one verb agreement required for the third person singular in the present tense (usually -s), as seen in the table '''Person Agreement for WALK: English'''. 
{| class="wikitable"
|+Agreement for WALK: English
!PERSON

|'''1st'''
|I walk
|We walk
|-
|'''2nd'''
|You walk
|You (all) walk
|-
|'''3rd'''
|He/she/it '''''walks'''''
|They walk
|}
In a null-subject language such as [[Italian language|Italian]], however, subjects are not required (in fact, in many null subject languages, producing overt subjects is a sign of non-nativity). Therefore, Italian uses a different inflectional morphology for each pronominal that is based not the person features of the nominal subject it agrees with:

&lt;u&gt;- Camminare (''to walk''):&lt;/u&gt;
cammin'''o''' (''I walk)'', cammin'''iamo''' (''we walk'')

camm'''ini''' (''you walk''), cammin'''ate''' (''you all walk'')

cammi'''na''' (''he/she walks''), camm'''inano''' (''they walk'')
=== Number ===
In English, number agreement is not inflected on Verbs like they are in other languages. This is partly because English is a language that requires subjects and the subjects in English overtly express number. In English, number is a phi-feature that is understood on the noun. In terms of inflectional morphology, the most common in English is ''-s'' inflected on nouns that are plural:

- Duck'''s''', fridge'''s''', baseball'''s''', cup'''s''', book'''s''', mirror'''s''', car'''s''', building'''s''', clown'''s''', bridge'''s''', cream'''s'''....

Some cases of plurality in English require conjugation of the entire noun to express the phi-feature of plurality:

- M'''en''', wom'''en''', m'''ice''', t'''eeth'''....

Neither verbs nor adjectives are used to agree with the phi-features of the noun that they are agreeing with in English.
[[File:Feminine and Masculine inflections (singular) in Italian.png|alt=|thumb|419x419px|Bolded words are the inflected forms for gender in Italian.]]

=== Gender ===
English is a language that does not have gendered nominal phrases and pronouns (except in the case of proper names of nouns that are sentient beings who belong to a certain gender category) and does not have phi-feature agreement for gender. Many other languages of the world do have gendered nouns. [[German language|German]], for example, has three genders; feminine, masculine and neuter. Italian has two: feminine and masculine phi-features. For Italian, inflections on the '''adjectives''' and '''determiners''' are used for gender agreement within the pronominal phrase.

=== Case ===
Reflexivity is overt in English for every person:

my'''''self'',''' your'''''self'',''' him'''''self''''', your'''''selves''''', our'''''selves''''', them'''''selves'''''

In many languages, reflexivity is not overt for person. A prime example is apparent in [[French language|French]] ''se''. French ''se'' is used to express reflexivity for every expression of the third person. For this reason, some theories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Déchaine|first=Rose-Marie|last2=Wiltschko|first2=Martina|date=2017-03-23|title=A Formal Typology of Reflexives|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/10.1111/stul.12072|journal=Studia Linguistica|language=en|volume=71|issue=1-2|pages=60–106|doi=10.1111/stul.12072|issn=0039-3193}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that reflexive phi-features for languages such as French posit in a level on the syntactic structure that is silent, between the determiner and the noun.

X'-theory approaches categorical features in this way: when a head X selects its' complement to project to X', the XP that it projects to then is a combination of the head X and all of its' categorical features&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=1c4gAAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=categorical+features+syntax&amp;ots=qYelHsihQL&amp;sig=VE_cP6B_sgmIe9tTy8W7tYg7r1o#v=onepage&amp;q=categorical%20features%20syntax&amp;f=false|title=The Syntax of Number, Person and Gender: A Theory of Phi-Features|last=Kerstens|first=Johan|date=2012-06-25|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110869361|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, those being either nominal, verbal, adjectival or prepositional features.

The '''Principles and Practice of Engineering exam''' is the examination required for one to become a [[Professional engineer|Professional Engineer]] (PE) in the United States.  It is the second exam required, coming after the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]].  

Upon passing the PE exam and meeting other eligibility requirements, that vary by state, such as education and experience, an engineer can then become registered in their State to stamp and sign engineering drawings and calculations as a PE.  

While the PE itself is sufficient for most engineering fields, some states require a further certification for structural engineers.  These require the passing of the [[Structural I exam]] and/or the [[Structural II exam]].

The PE Exam is created and scored by the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (NCEES). NCEES is a national non-profit organization composed of engineering and surveying licensing boards representing all states and U.S. territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/About_NCEES.php] About NCEES&lt;/ref&gt;


==Exam format==
Exams are offered twice a year, once in April and once in October, and are discipline-specific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/Exams/Pages/Exam_schedule.php/] NCEES; Exam Schedule&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the Structural exam, each exam is eight hours long, consisting of two 4-hour sessions administered in a single day with a lunch break. There are 40 multiple-choice questions per session. Several disciplines require a common morning breadth exam which broadly covers the discipline and then a more detailed afternoon depth exam where the test taker selects a more detailed area of the discipline. Other disciplines essentially have morning and afternoon breadth exams.&lt;ref name=format&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/Exams/PE_exam.php] Exam formats&lt;/ref&gt;

The Structural exam is 16 hours long and administered over two days, with two 4-hour sessions and a lunch break per day. Morning breadth sessions consist of 40 multiple-choice questions, while the afternoon depth sessions require essay responses. An examinee must earn a passing score on both days' exams in order to pass overall, but need not obtain those scores during the same administration of the exam.

==Disciplines==

PE exams are offered for the following disciplines:
*Agricultural and Biological Engineering (new specifications for the April 2015 exam)
*Architectural
*Chemical
*Civil: Construction (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Civil: Geotechnical (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Civil: Structural (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Civil: Transportation (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Civil: Water Resources and Environmental (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Control Systems
*Electrical and Computer: Computer Engineering
*Electrical and Computer: Electrical and Electronics
*Electrical and Computer: Power
*Environmental
*Fire Protection
*Industrial
*Mechanical: HVAC and Refrigeration
*Mechanical: Mechanical Systems and Materials
*Mechanical: Thermal and Fluids Systems
*Metallurgical and Materials (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Mining and Mineral Processing
*Naval Architecture and Marine
*Nuclear
*Petroleum
*Software
*Structural&lt;ref name="NCEES PE"&gt;{{cite web|title=NCEES: PE Exam|url=http://ncees.org/exams/pe-exam/|website=NCEES|publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;(with design standards for the 2015 exams)

Unlike the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam, outside reference sources are allowed for the PE Exam. The general rule is that any such materials must be in some sort of permanent binding (book, three-ring, spiral, etc.); loose papers and notes are prohibited. No writing tools or scratch paper may be brought in, and only calculators specifically approved by NCEES may be used. Examinees are provided with mechanical pencils and may use the test booklet as scratch paper for solving problems.

==Pass rates==
The PE exam is a professional exam much like the examinations required for public accounting, law, and other professions for which protection of the public is of the utmost concern. Consequently exam candidates typically spend large amounts of time preparing for the exam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/exams/study_materials/] NCEES; Study Materials&lt;/ref&gt; Exam pass rates vary by discipline module and test date, for the April 2010 exam, the pass rates for first time test takers ranged from 85% (Naval Architecture) to 46% (Structural I). The pass rates for repeat test takers is considerably lower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/Exams/PE_exam.php] Recent Exam Pass Rates&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professional development''' is learning to earn or maintain professional [[credentials]] such as [[academic degrees]] to formal coursework, attending conferences, and [[informal learning]] opportunities situated in practice. It has been described as intensive and collaborative, ideally incorporating an evaluative stage.&lt;ref&gt;Speck, M. &amp; Knipe, C. (2005) ''Why can't we get it right? Designing high-quality professional development for standards-based schools''(2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press{{qn|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of approaches to professional development, including consultation, coaching, [[communities of practice]], lesson study, mentoring, reflective supervision and technical assistance.&lt;ref name="community.fpg.unc.edu"&gt;National Professional Development Center on Inclusion. (2008). [http://fpg.unc.edu/node/4611 "What do we mean by professional development in the early childhood field?"]. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina, FPG Child Development Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[University of Management and Technology (United States)|University of Management and Technology]] notes the use of the phrase "professional development" from 1857 onwards.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In the training of school staff in the United States, "[t]he need for professional development [...] came to the forefront in the 1960s".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
A wide variety of people, such as teachers, military officers and non-commissioned officers, health care professionals, lawyers, accountants and engineers engage in professional development. Individuals may participate in professional development because of an interest in lifelong learning, a sense of moral obligation, to maintain and improve professional competence, to enhance career progression, to keep abreast of new technology and practices, or to comply with professional regulatory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Golding, L. &amp; Gray, I. (2006).''Continuing professional development for clinical psychologists:A practical handbook''. The British Psychological Society. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasper, M. (2006).''Professional development, reflection, and decision-making''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American states have professional development requirements for school teachers. For example, Arkansas teachers must complete 60 hours of documented professional development activities annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Development and Renewal of Standard Teaching License|url=http://www.arkansased.org/teachers/prof_dev_renewal.html|website=ArkansasEd.org|publisher=Arkansas Department of Education|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430155048/http://arkansased.org/teachers/prof_dev_renewal.html|archivedate=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional development credits are named differently from state to state. For example, teachers: in Indiana are required to earn 90 Continuing Renewal Units (CRUs) per year;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teacher-world.com/certification/indiana-renewal.html |title=Indiana Certification Renewal &amp;#124; Find Out How to Renew Indiana Teaching Certificates on |publisher=Teacher-world.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Massachusetts, teachers need 150 Professional Development Points (PDPs);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doe.mass.edu/recert/qa.html |title=Recertification Q and A - Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education |publisher=Doe.mass.edu |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Georgia, must earn 10 Professional Learning Units (PLUs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachersprofessionallearningunits.com/ga-certification-resources.php |title=Georgia Teacher Certification Information - Georgia PLU's Resources Online - GA Teaching License Resources |publisher=Teachersprofessionallearningunits.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216171116/http://teachersprofessionallearningunits.com/ga-certification-resources.php |archivedate=2013-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American and Canadian nurses, as well as those in the United Kingdom, have to participate in formal and informal professional development (earning credit based on attendance of education that has been accredited by a regulatory agency) in order to maintain professional registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuing Competence|url=http://www.crnm.mb.ca/competence.php|website=College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531032351/http://www.crnm.mb.ca/competence.php|archivedate=31 May 2008|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuing Education|url=http://www.ndbon.org/education/continuing%20education/continuing%20education.shtml|website=North Dakota Board of Nursing|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207190359/http://www.ndbon.org/education/continuing%20education/continuing%20education.shtml|archivedate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/ |title=The Nursing and Midwifery Council &amp;#124; Nursing and Midwifery Council |publisher=Nmc-uk.org |date=2014-03-14 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional school==
A professional school is a graduate school level institution that prepares students for careers in specific fields. Some of the schools also offer undergraduate degrees in specific professions. Examples of this type of school include:
[[List of international architecture schools|Architecture school]], [[Business school]], [[Divinity school]], [[Engineering school]], [[Journalism school]], [[Law school]], [[Library school]], [[School of education|Education school]] ([[Normal school]]), [[Public policy school]] and [[Council on Social Work Education|Social work school]]. The field of healthcare has many professional schools including [[Medical school]], [[Chiropractic school]], [[Dental school]], [[Pharmacy school]], [[Physician Assistant|Physician Assistant school]], [[Physiotherapy|Physiotherapy school]], [[Podiatric medical school]], [[Public health#Schools of public health|Public health school]], [[Speech-Language Pathology]] School, [[Occupational therapy|Occupational therapy school]], [[Nursing school]], [[Veterinary school]] and [[List of optometry schools|Optometry school]].

==Approaches==
In a broad sense, professional development may include ''formal'' types of vocational education, typically post-secondary or poly-technical training leading to qualification or credential required to obtain or retain employment. Professional development may also come in the form of pre-service or in-service professional development programs. These programs may be formal, or informal, group or individualized. Individuals may pursue professional development independently, or programs may be offered by human resource departments. Professional development on the job may develop or enhance process skills, sometimes referred to as leadership skills, as well as task skills. Some examples for process skills are 'effectiveness skills', 'team functioning skills', and 'systems thinking skills'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garet|first1=M. S.|last2=Porter|first2=A. C|last3=Desimone|first3=L.|last4=Birman|first4=B. F|last5=Yoon|first5=K. S.|title=What Makes Professional Development Effective? Results From a National Sample of Teachers|journal=American Educational Research Journal|date=1 January 2001|volume=38|issue=4|pages=915–945|doi=10.3102/00028312038004915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connecting Coaches to Corporates|url=https://twofold.asia/|website=twofold.asia|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional development opportunities can range from a single workshop to a semester-long academic course, to services offered by a medley of different professional development providers and varying widely with respect to the philosophy, content, and format of the learning experiences.  Some examples of approaches to professional development include:&lt;ref name="community.fpg.unc.edu"/&gt;

*'''Case Study Method''' – The case method is a teaching approach that consists in presenting the students with a case, putting them in the role of a decision maker facing a problem {{Harv|Hammond|1976}} – See [[Case method]].
*'''Consultation''' – to assist an individual or group of individuals to clarify and address immediate concerns by following a systematic problem-solving process.
*'''Coaching''' – to enhance a person’s competencies in a specific skill area by providing a process of observation, reflection, and action.
*'''Communities of Practice''' – to improve professional practice by engaging in shared inquiry and learning with people who have a common goal
*'''Lesson Study''' – to solve practical dilemmas related to intervention or instruction through participation with other professionals in systematically examining practice
*'''Mentoring''' – to promote an individual's  awareness and refinement of his or her own professional development by providing and recommending structured opportunities for reflection and observation
*'''Reflective Supervision''' – to support, develop, and ultimately evaluate the performance of employees through a process of inquiry that encourages their understanding and articulation of the rationale for their own practices
*'''Technical Assistance''' – to assist individuals and their organization to improve by offering resources and information, supporting networking and change efforts.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work &lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that professional development opportunities for those both in and out of work, such as flexible learning opportunities at universities and adult learning programs, enable labor markets to adjust to the future of work.

==Initial==
Initial professional development (IPD) is defined as "a period of development during which an individual acquires a level of [[Skill|competence]] necessary in order to operate as an autonomous professional".&lt;ref&gt;The UK Initial Professional Development (IPD) Forum http://www.littlerichley.eclipse.co.uk/ukipdforum/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Professional associations]] may recognise the successful completion of IPD by the award of [[chartered (professional)|chartered]] or similar status. Examples of professional bodies that require IPD prior to the award of professional status are the [[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ima.org.uk/activities/professional/initial_professional_development_ipd.cfm.html |title=Initial Professional Development (IPD) |publisher=The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istructe.org/careers-and-development/professional-development/initial-professional-development |title=Initial Professional Development |publisher=The Institution of Structural Engineers |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/About-membership/Professional-development/About-IPD.aspx |title=Membership: About membership: Professional development: About IPD |publisher=[[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health|(IOSH)]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing==
Continuing professional development (CPD) or continuing professional education (CPE) is [[continuing education]] to maintain knowledge and skills. Most [[profession]]s have CPD obligations. Examples are the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rics.org/uk/about-rics/what-we-do/continuing-professional-development/ |title=About RCIS: What we do: Continuing professional development (CPD) |publisher=[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Academy of Financial Management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialanalyst.org/ce.html|title=GAFM ®  Certified Financial Analyst Certification  Risk Certified Financial Planner Books GAFM ® -  AFA Accredited Financial Analyst ® Certification - AMA Accredited Management Accountant  ® - MMC Master Management Consultant ® Chartered Economist - Continuing Ed|website=www.financialanalyst.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; safety professionals with the [[International Institute of Risk &amp; Safety Management]] (IIRSM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iirsm.org/become_a_member/membership_levels |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927010130/http://www.iirsm.org/become_a_member/membership_levels |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]] (IOSH),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/About-membership/Professional-development/About-CPD.aspx |title=Membership: About membership: Professional development: About CPD |publisher=[[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health|(IOSH)]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and medical and legal professionals, who are subject to [[continuing medical education]] or [[continuing legal education]] requirements, which vary by jurisdiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9950">[[File:Mars rampart crater.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A rampart crater and its ejecta. This is classified as a multiple-layer ejecta crater]]
'''Rampart craters''' are a specific type of [[impact crater]] which are accompanied by distinctive [[fluid]]ized [[ejecta]] features found mainly on [[Mars]]. There is one example known on Earth, the [[Nördlinger Ries]] impact structure in Germany.&lt;ref name="SturmEtAl2013"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/41/5/531.abstract | title=The Ries impact, a double-layer rampart crater on Earth | first=Sebastian | last=Sturm | first2=Gerwin | last2=Wulf | first3=Dietmar | last3=Jung | first4=Thomas | last4=Kenkmann | journal=Geology | year=2013 | volume=41 | pages=531–534 | doi=10.1130/G33934.1| bibcode=2013Geo....41..531S }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rampart crater displays an ejecta with a low ridge along its edge.  Usually, rampart craters show a lobate outer margin, as if material moved along the surface, rather than flying up and down in a ballistic trajectory.  The flows sometimes are diverted around small obstacles, instead of falling on them.  The ejecta look as if they move as a mudflow.  Some of the shapes of Rampart craters can be duplicated by shooting projectiles into mud.  Although rampart craters can be found all over Mars, the smaller ones are only found in the high latitudes where ice is predicted to be close to the surface.  It seems that the impact has to be powerful enough to penetrate to the level of the subsurface ice.  Since ice is thought to be close to the surface in latitudes far from the equator, it does not take too strong of an impact to reach the ice level.&lt;ref name="Kieffer1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh H. Kieffer|title=Mars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoDvAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 March 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|isbn=978-0-8165-1257-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on images from the [[Viking program]] in the 1970s, it is generally accepted that rampart craters are evidence of ice or liquid water beneath the surface of Mars. The impact melts or boils the water in the subsurface producing a distinctive pattern of material surrounding the crater.

Ryan Schwegman described double layered ejecta (DLE) craters as showing two distinct layers of ejecta that appear to have been put in place as a mobile, ground-hugging flow. His measurements  suggest that ejecta mobility (the distance ejecta travels from the crater rim) typically goes up with increasing latitude and may reflect ice concentration.  That is the higher the latitude, the greater the ice content.  The  lobateness (curved shape of the perimeter of ejecta) usually goes down with increasing latitude. Furthermore, DLEs on sedimentary ground seem to display higher ejecta mobility than those on volcanic surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Schwegman, R.  2015.  MORPHOLOGY AND MORPHOMETRY OF DOUBLE LAYERED EJECTA CRATERS ON MARS.  The School of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies The University of Western Ontario London, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed discussion of various kinds of Martian craters, including double-layer ejecta craters (rampart craters) can be found in a 2014 paper by David Weiss and James Head &lt;ref&gt;Weiss, D., J. Head.  2014.  Ejecta mobility of layered ejecta craters on Mars:  Assessing the influence of snow and ice deposits.  Icarus:  233, 131–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Single-layered ejecta craters==

Single-layered ejecta craters are one type of rampart crater.  They have one ejecta lobe that extends 1 to 1.5 crater radii from the rim of the crater.  They have an average diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;km.  Although present at all latitudes, they are most common near the equator.  There average size increases the more distant from the equator.  It has been suggested that these types of craters are produced by impact into icy ground.  Specifically, it is an impact that does not go entirely through the icy layer.  The increase in size away from the equator is explained by a possible greater thickness in the icy layer away from the equator.&lt;ref&gt;Head, J., D. Weiss.   2017.  Evidence for stabilization of the ice-cemented crysphere in earlier martian history:  Implications for the current abundance of groundwater at depth on Mars.  Icarus:  288, 120–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double and multiple layered ejecta craters==
[[File:Ejectalayercratersfinal.jpg|thumb|Single-layer ejecta craters only penetrate into the icy upper layer, as shown on the left.  Multiple-layer ejecta craters go all the way through the icy layer and somewhat into the lower, ice-free layer (right).]]

Another type of rampart crater is called a double-layered ejecta (DLE) crater.  It displays two lobes of ejecta.  Related to these are (MLE) craters that have more than 2 or more layers of ejecta.   They are larger than single layered ejecta craters, having an average diameter of 22&amp;nbsp;km.  Their ejecta are about 2.2 radii from the crater rim. They are more concentrated near the equator (mostly between 40 degrees from the equator).  
[[File:Multiplelobecrater.jpg|thumb|left|Steinheim Crater which shows  more than one layer of ejecta. These are called double-layered ejecta craters.]]

Evidence leads researchers to believe that they result from an impact that goes through an icy layer and into a rocky layer.  There may be more of them closer to the equator because the icy layer is not as thick there; hence more impacts will penetrate all the way through the icy layer and into the rocky layer.  They are larger at all latitudes than single layer ejecta craters.  The icy layer has been called by different names:  cryosphere, permafrost, and ice-cemented cryosphere.
[[File:PIA10741 Possible Ice Below Phoenix.jpg|thumb|View underneath Phoenix lander towards south foot pad, showing patchy exposures of a bright surface that was later confirmed to be water ice, as predicted by theory and detected by [[Mars Odyssey]].]]
Researchers have analyzed the distribution of both of these craters to determine the thickness of an icy layer that may surround the total surface of Mars.  The depth of a crater has been found to be about one tenth of its diameter.  So by measuring the diameter, the depth can be easily found.   They mapped the position and size of all of these craters and then determined the maximum size of single-layered craters and the smallest size for multiple-layered craters  for each latitude.  Remember the single-layered ejecta crater does not penetrate the icy layer, but the multiple-layered does.  An average of those should give the thickness of the icy layer.  From such an analysis, they determined that the icy layer or cryosphere varies from about 1.3&amp;nbsp;km (equator) to 3.3&amp;nbsp;km (poles).  This represents a great deal of frozen water.  It would be equal to 200 meters of water spread over the entire planet, if one assumes 20% pore space.&lt;ref&gt;Head, J., D. Weiss.   2017.  Evidence for stabilization of the ice-cemented cryosphere in earlier martian history:  Implications for the current abundance of groundwater at depth on Mars.  Icarus:  288, 120–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phoenix lander confirmed the existence of large amounts of water ice in the northern regions of Mars.  This finding was predicted by theory and was measured from orbit by the Mars Odyssey instruments, so the idea that rampart crater size shows the depth to ice was confirmed by other space probes.  The image below from the Phoenix lander shows ice that was exposed by the descent engines.

They are normally small craters found in the far north or south parts of the planet

==Pancake Craters==
[[File:Pancake48.8n.jpg|thumb|A pancake crater. Note the flat top and lack of a visible rampart.]]
In the Mariner and Viking mission a type of crater was found that was called a "Pancake Crater."  It is similar to a rampart crater, but does not have a rampart.  The ejecta is flat along its whole area, like a pancake.  Under higher resolutions it resembles a double-layer crater that has degraded.  These craters are found in the same latitudes as double-layer craters (40–65 degrees).&lt;ref&gt;Mouginis-Mark, P.  1979. Martian fluidized crater morphology: Variations with crater size, latitude, altitude, and target material.  Journal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth:  84,  8011–8022.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that they are just the inner layer of a double-layer crater in which the outer, thin layer has eroded.&lt;ref&gt;Costard, F.  1989.  The spatial distributions of volatiles in the Martian hydrolithosphere, EARTH, MOON, AND PLANETS:  45, 265–290.&lt;/ref&gt;  Craters classified as pancakes in Viking images, turned out to be double-layer craters when seen at higher resolutions by later spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, N.  MARTIAN IMPACT CRATERS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR TARGET CHARACTERISTICS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kieffer, H.et al.  1992.  Mars.  University of Arizona Press, Tucson&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Tudományos Akadémia Nyelvtudományi Intézete}})  was created in 1949, is under supervision of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] since 1951. Its primary tasks include research in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] [[linguistics]], general, theoretical and applied linguistics, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] linguistics, and [[phonetics]], as well as the preparation of a comprehensive [[dictionary]] of the Hungarian language, and the maintenance of its archive materials. Other research projects investigate various aspects and different variants of Hungarian. Further tasks include the assembly of linguistic corpora and databases, and laying the linguistic groundwork for computational software and applications. The Institute also operates a public advice service on language and linguistics, prepares expert reports on relevant affairs on demand, and runs the Theoretical Linguistics Undergraduate and Doctoral Program jointly with [[Eötvös Loránd University]].

== Purpose ==

The Society exists to encourage interest in the history of architecture, to enable the exchange and discussion of ideas related to this. The Society has no official location and its activities cover the [[United Kingdom]]. The Society also represents the interests of UK architectural history to governmental and non-governmental bodies within the education and heritage fields. The Society specifically avoids conservation issues.

''[[Architectural History (journal)|Architectural History]]'' is the main journal of the society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications Publications: Architectural History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311062734/http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications |date=2011-03-11 }}, ''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is published each autumn and members of SAHBG receive a copy. There is also a newsletter for members.

== History ==

The foundation of the Society was prompted in 1955 by [[Turpin Bannister]] in discussion with [[Frank Jenkins (architect)|Frank Jenkins]], a British architect and scholar who worked with Bannister at the [[University of Illinois]] in the [[United States]]. Initially it was conceived as being a chapter of the American [[Society of Architectural Historians]] partly because Bannister had been a founder-member in 1940. However, it was decided in 1956 that the Society should be independent. The early members were mainly architects and teachers. The Chairmen of the first meetings were Bruce Allsopp and William A. Singleton, the latter affiliated with the [[York Institute of Architectural Study]].

The '''structural channel''', also known as a '''C-beam''' or '''Parallel Flange Channel''' (PFC), is a type of (usually [[structural steel]]) [[beam (structure)|beam]], used primarily in building construction and civil engineering.  Its cross section consists of a wide "web", usually but not always oriented vertically, and two "flanges" at the top and bottom of the web, only sticking out on one side of the web.  It is distinguished from [[I-beam]] or H-beam or W-beam type steel cross sections in that those have flanges on both sides of the web.&lt;ref&gt;Manual of Steel Construction, 8th Edition, 2nd revised printing, American Institute of Steel Construction, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__

==Usage==
[[File:L-U-Traeger.png|thumb|right|150px|Cross-section.]]
The structural channel is not used as much in construction as symmetrical beams, in part because its bending axis is not centered on the width of the flanges.  If a load is applied equally across its top, the beam will tend to twist away from the web.  This may not be a weak point or problem for a particular design, but is a factor to be considered.&lt;ref name=Gere&gt;Gere and Timoshenko, 1997, ''Mechanics of Materials'', PWS Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Channels or C-beams are often used where the flat, back side of the web can be mounted to another flat surface for maximum contact area.  They are also sometimes welded together back-to-back to form a non-standard I-beam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2831">In [[computational complexity theory]], '''Håstad's switching lemma''' is a key tool for proving lower bounds on the size of constant-depth [[Boolean circuits]].
Using the switching lemma, {{harvs|first=Johan|last=Håstad|authorlink=Johan Håstad|year=1987|txt}} showed that [[Boolean circuits]] of depth ''k'' in which only AND, OR, and NOT [[logic gate]]s are allowed require size

: &lt;math&gt;\exp\left(\Omega\left(n^{\frac{1}{k-1}}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

for computing the [[parity function]].

The switching lemma says that depth-2 circuits in which some fraction of the variables have been set randomly depend with high probability only on very few variables after the restriction. The name of the switching lemma stems from the following observation: Take an arbitrary formula in [[conjunctive normal form]], which is in particular a depth-2 circuit. Now the switching lemma guarantees that after setting some variables randomly, we end up with a Boolean function that depends only on few variables, i.e., it can be computed by a [[decision tree]] of some small depth &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. This allows us to write the restricted function as a small formula in [[disjunctive normal form]]. A formula in conjunctive normal form hit by a random restriction of the variables can therefore be "switched" to a small formula in disjunctive normal form.

The original proof of the switching lemma {{harv|Håstad|1987}} involves an argument with [[conditional probabilities]].
Arguably simpler proofs have been subsequently given by {{harvtxt|Razborov|1993}} and {{harvtxt|Beame|1994}}. For an introduction, see Chapter 14 in {{harvtxt|Arora|Barak|2009}}.

==Sequence curation==

Sequence curation at WormBase refers to the maintenance and annotation of the primary genomic sequence and a consensus gene set.

===Genome sequence===

Even though the ''C. elegans'' genome sequence is the most accurate and complete eukaryotic genome sequence, it has continually needed refinement as new evidence has been created. Many of these changes were single nucleotide insertions or deletions, however several large mis-assemblies have been uncovered. For example, in 2005 a 39 kb cosmid had to be inverted. Other improvements have come from comparing genomic DNA to cDNA sequences and analysis of RNASeq high-throughput data.  When differences between the genomic sequence and transcripts are identified, re-analysis of the original genomic data often leads to modifications of the genomic sequence. 
The changes in the genomic sequence pose difficulties when comparing chromosomal coordinates of data derived from different releases of WormBase. To aid these comparisons, a coordinate re-mapping  program and data are available from: 
http://wiki.wormbase.org/index.php/Converting_Coordinates_between_releases

===Gene structure models===

All the gene-sets of the WormBase species were initially generated by gene prediction programs. Gene prediction programs give a reasonable set of gene structures, but the best of them only predict about 80% of the complete gene structures correctly. They have difficulty predicting genes with unusual structures, as well as those with a weak translation start signal, weak splice sites or single exon genes. They can incorrectly predict a coding gene model where the gene is a pseudogene and they predict the isoforms of a gene poorly, if at all.

The gene models of ''C. elegans'', ''C. briggsae'', ''C. remanei'', and ''C. brenneri''  genes are manually curated. The majority of gene structure changes have been based on transcript data from large scale projects such as Yuji Kohara’s EST libraries, Mark Vidal’s Orfeome project (worfdb.dfci.harvard.edu/) Waterston and Hillier’s Illumina data and Makedonka Mitreva’s 454 data.  However, other data types (e.g. protein alignments, ''ab initio'' prediction programs, trans-splice leader sites, poly-A signals and addition sites, SAGE and [[TEC-RED]] transcript tags, mass-spectroscopic peptides, and conserved protein domains) are useful in refining the structures, especially where expression is low and so transcripts are not sufficiently available. When genes are conserved between the available nematode species, comparative analysis can also be very informative.

WormBase encourages researchers to inform them via the help-desk if they have evidence for an incorrect gene structure. Any cDNA or mRNA sequence evidence for the change should be submitted to EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ; this helps in the confirmation and evidence for the gene model as WormBase routinely retrieve sequence data from these public databases. This also makes the data public, allowing appropriate reference and acknowledgement to the researchers.

When any change is made to a CDS (or Pseudogene), the old gene model is preserved as a ‘history’ object. This will have a suffix name like: “AC3.5:wp119”, where ‘AC3.5’ is the name of the CDS and the ‘119’ refers to the database release in which the change was made. The reason for the change and the evidence for the change are added to the annotation of the CDS – these can be seen in the Visible/Remark section of the CDS’s ‘Tree Display’ section on the WormBase web site.

==Gene nomenclature==

===Genes===

In WormBase, a Gene is a region that is expressed or a region that has been expressed and is now a Pseudogene. Genes have unique identifiers like ‘WBGene00006415’. All C. elegans WormBase genes also have a Sequence Name, which is derived from the cosmid, fosmid or YAC clone on which they reside, for instance '''F38H4.7''', indicating it is on the cosmid ‘F38H4’, and there are at least 6 other genes on that cosmid. If a gene produces a protein that can be classified as a member of a family, the gene may also be assigned a '''CGC''' name like '''tag-30''' indicating that this is the 30th member of the '''tag''' gene family. Assignment of gene family names is controlled by WormBase &lt;ref name="Gene Nomenclature"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.wormbase.org/index.php/UserGuide:Nomenclature |title = WormBase Gene Nomenclature |publisher=[[Wormbase]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and requests for names should be made, before publication, via the form at: http://tazendra.caltech.edu/~azurebrd/cgi-bin/forms/gene_name.cgi

There are a few exceptions to this format, like the genes '''cln-3.1''', '''cln-3.2''', and '''cln-3.3''' which all are equally similar to the human gene '''CLN3'''.
Gene GCG names for non-elegans species in WormBase have the 3-letter species code prepended, like '''Cre-acl-5''', '''Cbr-acl-5''', '''Cbn-acl-5'''.

A gene can be a Pseudogene, or can express one or more non-coding RNA genes (ncRNA) or protein-coding sequences (CDS).

===Pseudogenes===

Pseudogenes are genes that do not produce a reasonable, functional transcript. They may be pseudogenes of coding genes or of non-coding RNA and may be whole or fragments of a gene and may or may not express a transcript. The boundary between what is considered a ''reasonable'' coding transcript is sometimes subjective as, in the absence of other evidence, the use of weak splice sites or short exons can often produce a putative, though unsatisfactory, model of a CDS. Pseudogenes and genes with a problematic structure are constantly under review in WormBase and new evidence is used to try to resolve their status.

===CDSs===

Coding Sequences (CDSs) are the only part of a Gene's structure that is manually curated in WormBase. The structure of the Gene and its transcripts are derived from the structure of their CDSs.

CDSs have a Sequence Name that is derived from the same Sequence Name as their parent Gene object, so the gene ‘F38H4.7’ has a CDS called ‘F38H4.7’. The CDS specifies coding exons in the gene from the START (Methionine) codon up to (and including) the STOP codon.

Any gene can code for multiple proteins as a result of alternative splicing. These isoforms have a name that is formed from the Sequence Name of the gene with a unique letter appended. In the case of the gene '''bli-4''' there are 6 known CDS isoforms, called K04F10.4a, K04F10.4b, K04F10.4c, K04F10.4d, K04F10.4e and K04F10.4f.

It is common to refer to isoforms in the literature using the CGC gene family name with a letter appended, for example '''pha-4a''', however this has no meaning within the WormBase database and searches for '''pha-4a''' in WormBase will not return anything. The correct name of this isoform is either the CDS/Transcript name: '''F38A6.1a''', or even better, the Protein name: '''WP:CE15998'''.

===Gene transcripts===

The transcripts of a gene in WormBase are automatically derived by mapping any available cDNA or mRNA alignments onto the CDS model. These gene transcripts will therefore often include the UTR exons surrounding the CDS. If there are no available cDNA or mRNA transcripts, then the gene transcripts will have exactly the same structure as the CDS that they are modelled on.

Gene transcripts are named after the Sequence Name of the CDS used to create them, for example, '''F38H4.7''' or '''K04F10.4a'''.

However if there is alternative splicing in the UTRs, which would not change the protein sequence, the alternatively spliced transcripts are named with a digit appended, for example: '''K04F10.4a.1''' and '''K04F10.4a.2'''. If there are no isoforms of the coding gene, for example '''AC3.5''', but there is alternative splicing in the UTRs, there will be multiple transcripts named '''AC3.5.1''' and '''AC3.5.2''', etc. If there are no alternate UTR transcripts the single coding_transcript is named the same as the CDS and does not have the .1 appended, as in the case of K04F10.4f.

===Operons===

Groups of genes which are co-transcribed as operons are curated as Operon objects. These have names like '''CEOP5460''' and are manually curated using evidence from the SL2 trans-spliced leader sequence sites.

===Non-coding RNA genes===

There are several classes of non-coding RNA gene classes in WormBase:

* [[tRNA]] genes are predicted by the program ‘tRNAscan-SE’.
* [[rRNA]] genes are predicted by homology with other species.
* [[snRNA]] genes are mainly imported from [[Rfam]].
* [[piRNA]] genes are from an analysis of the characteristic motif in these genes.
* [[miRNA]] genes have mainly been imported from [[miRBase]]. They have the primary transcript and the mature transcript marked up. The primary transcript will have a Sequence name like '''W09G3.10''' and the mature transcript will have a letter added to this name like '''W09G3.10a''' (and if there are alternative mature transcripts, '''W09G3.10b''', etc.).
* [[snoRNA]] genes are mainly imported from Rfam or from papers.
* ncRNA genes that have no obvious other function but which are obviously not protein-coding and are not pseudogenes are curated.  Many of these have conserved homology with genes in other species. A few of these are expressed on the reverse sense to protein-coding genes.

There is also one scRNA gene.

===Transposons===

Transposons are not classed as genes and so do not have a parent gene object. Their structure is curated as a Transposon_CDS object with a name like '''C29E6.6'''.

==Other species==

The non-elegans species in WormBase have genomes that have been assembled from sequencing technologies that do not involve sequencing cosmids or YACs. These species therefore do not have sequence names for CDSs and gene transcripts that are based on cosmid names. Instead they have unique alphanumeric identifiers constructed like the names in the table below.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; width: 200px; height: 200px;"
|+ Genes names
|-
! scope="col" | Species 
! scope="col" | Example Gene name
|-
| [[Caenorhabditis briggsae|C. briggsae]] || CBG00001
|-
| [[Caenorhabditis remanei|C. remanei]] ||  CRE00001
|-
| [[Caenorhabditis brenneri|C. brenneri]] ||  CBN00001
|-
| [[Caenorhabditis japonica|C. japonica]] || CJA00001
|-
| [[Pristionchus pacificus]] || PPA00001 
|}

===Proteins===

The protein products of gene are created by translating the CDS sequences. Each unique protein sequence is given a unique identifying name like '''WP:CE40440'''.  Examples of the protein identifier names for each species in WormBase is given in the table, below.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; width: 200px; height: 200px;"
|+ Genes names
|-
! scope="col" | Species 
! scope="col" | Example Protein name
|-
| C. elegans || WP:CE00001
|-
| C. briggsae || BP:CBP00001
|-
| C. remanei ||  RP:RP00001
|-
| C. brenneri ||  CN:CN00001
|-
| C. japonica || JA:JA00001
|-
| Pristionchus pacificus ||  PP:PP00001
|-
| [[Heterorhabditis bacteriophora]] || HB:HB00001
|-
| [[Brugia malayi]] || BM:BM00001
|-
| [[Meloidogyne hapla]] || MH:MH00001
|-
| [[Meloidogyne incognita]] || MI:MI00001
|-
| [[Haemonchus contortus]] || HC:HC00001
|}

It is possible for two CDS sequences from separate genes, within a species, to be identical and so it is possible to have identical proteins coded for by separate genes. When this happens, a single, unique identifying name is used for the protein even though it is produced by two genes.

==ParaSite==
[http://parasite.wormbase.org/ WormBase ParaSite] is a sub-portal for approximately 100 draft genomes of parasitic helminths ([[nematode]]s and [[platyhelminthes]]) developed at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] and [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;http://parasite.wormbase.org&lt;/ref&gt;  All genomes are assembled and annotated.
