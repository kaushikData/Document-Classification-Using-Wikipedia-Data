As a rule of thumb, the activating function is proportional to the second-order spatial derivative of the extracellular potential along the axon.

== Equations ==
In a compartment model of an axon, the activating function of compartment n, &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt;, is derived from the driving term of the external potential, or the equivalent injected current

&lt;math&gt;f_n=1/c\left( \frac{V^e_{n-1}-V^e_{n}}{R_{n-1}/2+R_{n}/2} + \frac{V^e_{n+1}-V^e_{n}}{R_{n+1}/2+R_{n}/2} + ... \right) &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane capacity, &lt;math&gt;V^e_n&lt;/math&gt; the extracellular voltage outside compartment &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; relative to the ground and &lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt; the axonal resistance of compartment &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

The activating function represents the rate of [[membrane potential]] change if the neuron is in resting state before the stimulation. Its physical dimensions are V/s or mV/ms. In other words, it represents the slope of the [[Membrane potential|membrane voltage]] at the beginning of the [[Electric stimulation|stimulation]].&lt;ref name=Rattay2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Rattay, F. |author2=Greenberg, R.J. |author3=Resatz, S.|title=Handbook of Neuroprosthetic Methods,|year=2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-1100-0|chapter=Neuron modeling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following McNeal's&lt;ref name=McNeal1976&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McNeal | first1 = D. R. | doi = 10.1109/TBME.1976.324593 | title = Analysis of a Model for Excitation of Myelinated Nerve | journal = IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering | issue = 4 | pages = 329–337 | year = 1976 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; simplifications for long fibers of an ideal internode membrane, with both membrane capacity and conductance assumed to be 0 the differential equation determining the [[membrane potential]] &lt;math&gt;V^m&lt;/math&gt; for each node is:

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dV^m_n}{dt}=\left[-i_{ion,n} + \frac{d\Delta x}{4\rho_i L} \cdot \left( \frac{V^m_{n-1}-2V^m_n+V^m_{n+1}}{\Delta x^2}+ \frac{V^e_{n-1}-2V^e_{n}+V^e_{n+1}}{\Delta x^2} \right) \right] / c
&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the constant fiber diameter, &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; the node-to-node distance, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; the node length &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt; the axomplasmatic resistivity, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the capacity and &lt;math&gt;i_{ion}&lt;/math&gt; the ionic currents. From this the activating function follows as:

&lt;math&gt;
f_n=\frac{d\Delta x}{4\rho_i Lc} \frac{V^e_{n-1}-2V^e_{n}+V^e_{n+1}}{\Delta x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;.

In this case the activating function is proportional to the second order spatial difference of the extracellular potential along the fibers. If &lt;math&gt;L = \Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta x \to 0&lt;/math&gt; then:

&lt;math&gt;
f=\frac{d}{4\rho_ic}\cdot\frac{\delta^2V^e}{\delta x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the second order spatial differential along the fiber.

== Interpretation ==
Positive values of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; suggest a  depolarization of the membrane potential and negative values a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential.

== History ==
Amadeus was originally created as a neutral [[global distribution system]] (GDS) by [[Air France]], [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]], [[Lufthansa]] and [[SAS Group|SAS]] in 1987 in order to connect providers' content with travel agencies and consumers in real time. The creation of Amadeus was intended to offer a European alternative to [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], an American GDS. The first Amadeus system was built from core reservation system code coming from System One, an American GDS that competed with Sabre but went bankrupt, and a copy of the Air France pricing engine. These systems were respectively running under [[IBM]] [[Transaction Processing Facility|TPF]] and [[Unisys]]. At the beginning of Amadeus, the Amadeus systems were functionally dedicated to airline reservation and centered on the [[Passenger Name Record|PNR]] (Passenger Name Record), the passenger's travel file. Throughout the years, the PNR was opened up to additional travel industries (hotels, rail, cars, cruises, ferries, insurance, etc.).

Although established initially as a private partnership, Amadeus went public in October 1999, becoming listed on the Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid stock exchanges. Progressively and in line with industry evolution, Amadeus diversified its operations by focusing on information technologies (IT) to deliver services spanning beyond sales and reservation functionalities, centred on streamlining the operational and distribution requirements of its customer base.

In 2000, Amadeus received an [[ISO 9000#2000 version|ISO 9001:2000]] quality certification – the first GDS company to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120730050616/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-70196815.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, the company has invested €1 billion in R&amp;D&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingtravelnews.com/news/article/amadeus-announcese-2009-financial-performance/ |title=Amadeus announcese 2009 financial performance &amp;#124; News |publisher=Breaking Travel News |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Amadeus's technology has increasingly embraced open systems which provide clients with more flexibility and features, as well as other benefits. {{As of|2010}}&lt;!-- Inserted with this edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amadeus_IT_Group&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=365617154 in June 2010, so it must be at least that old. --&gt;, 85% of its addsoftware portfolio was open system based and it expects by the end of 2016 to have fully migrated away from mainframe-based TPF software.&lt;ref name="TPF Migration"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gerry Smith|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7aoG--oPkM |title=Amadeus' Gerry Smith on leaving behind legacy systems|date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Amadeus was delisted from the Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid stock exchanges when [[BC Partners]] and [[Cinven]] bought their stake from three of the four founding airlines and the rest of the capital floated from institutional and minority shareholders. The transition from distribution system to technology provider was reflected by the change in its corporate name in 2006, when the company name was changed to Amadeus IT Group. In 2009, Amadeus invested about €257 million in R&amp;D.&lt;ref name="tnooz.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.tnooz.com/2010/03/23/news/amadeus-2009-results-top-line-summary/ |title=Amadeus 2009 results - top-line summary |publisher=Tnooz |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amadeus is again listed on the Spanish Stock Exchanges as of 29 April 2010 (AMS).

== Data centre ==
Amadeus has its own data centre in Erding, Germany. In 2010, the Erding complex processed ½ billion transactions per day, and handled, on average, {{formatnum:9000}} user data queries per second, with a system response time of less than 3 milliseconds and an average system uptime of 99.99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amadeus.com/amadeus/x144757.html |title=The Amadeus Data Centre in Figures - Travel Technology Solutions |publisher=Amadeus |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amadeus' global operations comprise not only the main site in Erding, Germany, but also two strategic operation centres in Miami, United States and Sydney, Australia, and local competency centres in Germany, Thailand, India, Poland, Colombia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.

== Overview of the company's business and activities ==

===Distribution===
Amadeus CRS is the largest GDS provider in the worldwide travel and tourism industry, with an estimated market share of 37% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amadeus-it-holding-plans-spain-ipo-for-2010-2010-03-23 |title=Amadeus IT Holding plans Spain IPO for 2010 |publisher=MarketWatch |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, over {{formatnum:90000}} travel agencies worldwide use the Amadeus system and {{formatnum:58000}} airline sales offices use it as their internal sales and reservations system. Amadeus gives access to bookable content from 435 airlines (including 60 low-cost carriers), 29 car rental companies (representing {{formatnum:36000}} car rental locations), 51 cruise lines and ferry operators, 280 hotel chains and {{formatnum:87000}} hotels, 200 tour operators, 103 rail operators and 116 travel insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amadeus.com/amadeus/x8452.xml |title=Figures - Travel Technology Solutions |publisher=Amadeus |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IT Solutions===
The principal service of this business area is the Amadeus Altéa Customer Management System&lt;ref&gt;http://www.traveldailynews.com/pages/show_page/36831--Amadeus-processes-record-number-of-airline-passengers-through-its-Altea-platform{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (CMS), a software suite which addresses airlines' sales and reservations, inventory management and departure control.

Unlike the carriers’ legacy IT systems, the Altéa platform is based on a common technical infrastructure and software. With Altéa, airlines outsource their IT operations onto a community platform which allows them to share information with both [[airline alliance]] and [[Codeshare agreement|code-share]] partners.

The Altéa suite presently consists of four main modules:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amadeus.com/airlineIT/index.html |title=Airline IT solutions and Consulting services &amp;#124; Amadeus Altea Suite |publisher=Amadeus.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altéa Reservation, providing booking, pricing and ticketing management through a single interface; Altéa Inventory, providing schedule and seat capacity management on a flight-by-flight basis; Altéa Departure Control, a [[departure control system]] software package; and Altéa e-commerce, a [[software suite]] for airline e-commerce sales and support.

In 2009, the number of passengers boarded by airlines using Amadeus Altéa was 238 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelagentcentral.com/airline-policies/amadeus-processes-record-airline-passengers-21237 |title=Altea CMS Air Travel Booking Platform Aids Sales |publisher=Travel Agent Central |date=2010-05-04 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amadeus is extending its IT solutions business with the ongoing development of similar systems for rail companies, hotel chains, airport operators and [[Aircraft ground handling|ground handling]] companies.

=== Contribution to open source projects ===
According to a May 2015 investigation, Amadeus has contributed to the [[Docker (software)|Docker]]  open source software project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2925484/application-virtualization/look-whos-helping-build-docker-besides-docker-itself.html |title=Look who's helping build Docker -- besides Docker itself |publisher=InfoWorld |date=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model and other business lines ==
The business model of Amadeus is booking fee or transaction based, which means that a fee is taken for each confirmed net booking made in the Amadeus CRS. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In late 1990s, a business division specialized in e-commerce was created.{{clarify|date=August 2016}}

In 2000, Amadeus was awarded the development of two new operational applications for [[British Airways]] and [[Qantas]]: the inventory management and the departure control systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackbeard.com/tpf/tpfscoop1.htm TPF Scoop Archives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183533/http://www.blackbeard.com/tpf/tpfscoop1.htm |date=March 3, 2016 }}. Blackbeard.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt; These products were outside of the core expertise domain of Amadeus and were built with the expertise of the airlines.

In March 2015, Amadeus announced that [[Blacklane]], a Berlin-based professional driver service available worldwide, would become their first fully integrated taxi and transfer solution provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cobbold|first1=Laura|last2=Parker|first2=Adam|title=A pick-me-up for travellers thanks to Blacklane and Amadeus|url=http://www.amadeus.com/web/amadeus/en_1A-corporate/Amadeus-Home/News-and-events/News/2015-03-05-Blacklane-and-Amadeus/1319560217161-Page-AMAD_DetailPpal?assetid=1319622216731&amp;assettype=PressRelease_C|website=Amadeus.com|publisher=Amadeus|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Authorize.Net''' is a United States-based [[payment gateway]] service provider allowing [[merchant]]s to accept [[credit card]] and [[e-check|electronic check]] payments through their [[website]] and over an [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) connection. Founded in 1996, Authorize.Net is now a subsidiary of [[Visa Inc.]] Its service permits customers to enter credit card and shipping information directly onto a web page, in contrast to some alternatives that require the customer to sign up for a payment service before performing a transaction.&lt;ref name=Arc17&gt;{{cite news | title=5 Tips To Make Digital Payments Easier For Ecommerce | first=Dan | last=Rowinski | date=June 28, 2017 | work=Arc | url=https://arc.applause.com/2017/06/28/digital-payments-ecommerce-best-pratices/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outages===
In September 2004, Authorize.Net's servers were hit by a [[Distributed Denial of Service]] (DDoS) attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,65039,00.html |title=Hack Attack Gums Up Authorize.Net |publisher=Wired.com |date=2004-09-21 |accessdate=2004-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040923104754/http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0%2C1377%2C65039%2C00.html |archivedate=2004-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DDoS attack lasted for over one week and caused a virtual shut down of the [[payment gateway]]'s service. The attackers demanded money from Authorize.net in exchange for stopping the attack.

On July 2, 2009, 11pm, the entire web infrastructure for Authorize.Net (main website, merchant gateway website, etc.) went offline and stayed down all morning July 3, 2009.&lt;ref name="fire2009"&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009415571_apwafisherplazafire1stldwritethru.html Fire disrupts stations at Seattle's Fisher Plaza] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706041326/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009415571_apwafisherplazafire1stldwritethru.html |date=July 6, 2009 }} Friday, July 3, 2009 at 9:42 AM, [[Seattle Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Fisher-Communications-Inc-NASDAQ-FSCI-1012899.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706181412/http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Fisher-Communications-Inc-NASDAQ-FSCI-1012899.html |archivedate=2009-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the over 200,000 merchants who use Authorize.Net payment gateway were able to process credit cards. Authorize.Net's phone numbers were closed July 3 because of the July 4th holiday as previously announced on their website (though the website was down at the time).&lt;ref&gt;https://account.authorize.net/UI/themes/MintAnnouncement.htm .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3504">An '''bronchial blocker''' (also called '''endobronchial blocker''') is a device which can be inserted down a [[tracheal tube]] after [[tracheal intubation]] so as to block off the right or left main [[bronchus]] of the [[lungs]] in order to be able to achieve a controlled one sided [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] of the lungs in [[thoracic surgery]]. The lung tissue distal to the obstruction will collapse, thus allowing the surgeon's view and access to relevant structures within the [[thoracic cavity]].

Bronchial blockers are used to achieve lung separation and one lung ventilation as an alternative to [[Double-lumen endotracheal tube|double-lumen endotrachealtubes]] (DLT) and are the method of choice in children and paediatric patients for whom even the smallest DLTs might be too big.&lt;ref name=Brodsky&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brodsky|first=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7601">'''Building performance''' is an attribute of a [[building]] that expresses how well that building carries out its functions. It may also relate to the [[performance]] of the building [[construction]] process. Categories of building performance are quality (how well the building fulfils its functions), [[resource]] saving (how much resource is needed to fulfil its functions) and [[workload]] capacity (how much the building can do). The performance of a building depends on the response of the building to an external [[structural load|load]] or shock. Building performance plays an important role in [[architecture]], [[building services engineering]], [[building code|building regulation]], [[architectural engineering]] and [[construction management]]. Prominent building performance aspects are [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[thermal comfort]], [[indoor air quality]] and [[daylighting]].

==Background==
{{cleanup rewrite|date=October 2016}}
Building performance has been of interest to humans from the very first shelters built to protect us from the weather, natural enemies and other dangers. Initially design and performance were managed by craftsmen who combined expertise in both domains. More formal approaches to building performance appeared in the 1970s and 1980s, with seminal works being the book on ''Building Performance''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Performance|last=Markus et al|first=|publisher=Applied Science Publishers LTD|year=1972|isbn=085334 542 2|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''CIB Report 64''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=CIB Report 64 - Working with the Performance Approach in Building|last=CIB Working Commission W60|first=|publisher=International Council for Building Research Studies and Documentation|year=1982|isbn=|location=Rotterdam|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Further progress on building performance studies took place in parallel with the development of building science as a discipline, and with the introduction of personal computing (especially computer simulation) in the field; for a good overview of the role of simulation in building design see the chapter by Augenbroe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The role of simulation in performance based building. In: Hensen and Lamberts (eds), Building performance simulation for design and operation.|last=Augenbroe|first=Godfried|publisher=Spon Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-415-47414-6|location=Abingdon, Oxon|pages=15-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A more general overview that also includes physical measurement, expert judgement and stakeholder evaluation is presented in the book ''Building Performance Analysis''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Performance Analysis|last=de Wilde|first=Pieter|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2018|isbn=9781119341925|location=Hoboken / Chichester|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== '''ASHRAE Performance Measurement Protocols''' ===
Although many buildings in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and elsewhere claim to be “green,” “low energy,” or “high performance,” it is rarely clear on what evidence or data these claims are based. Such claims cannot be credible without standardized performance measurement protocols that are applied consistently. If claims of superior building performance are to be believed, it is essential that a common set of measurements be used and the results reported against meaningful benchmarks. Such protocols are also needed to give usable feedback to building designers and operators when measured performance does not match design intent.  &lt;ref name="ASHRAE"&gt;https://www.ashrae.org/resources--publications/periodicals/ashrae-journal/features/measuring-commercial-building-performancel{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This article describes ASHRAE’s Performance Measurement Protocols for Commercial Buildings (PMP), which provides a standardized, consistent set of protocols, for a range of cost/accuracy, to facilitate the appropriate comparison of measured energy, water, and indoor environmental quality (thermal comfort, indoor air quality [IAQ], lighting, and acoustics) performance of commercial buildings, while maintaining acceptable levels of building service for the occupants. Benchmarks are included in the protocols to facilitate comparison to peer buildings or for self-reference over time (often before and after retrofit). A recent article describing just the acoustic performance measurement protocols in the PMP has been published in the ASHRAE Journal. 
The PMP is a collaborative effort of ASHRAE, the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), and the Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers (CIBSE). It began with a detailed evaluation of literature related to measured building performance that included databases, measurement techniques, M&amp;V protocols, and available instrumentation. A project committee representing several ASHRAE Technical Committees (TCs 7.6, 7.9, 4.7, and others) developed the content.

The protocols identify what to measure, how it is to be measured (instrumentation and spatial resolution), and how often it is to be measured for inclusion in the building’s operation and maintenance plan. For each of the six measure categories (energy, water, thermal comfort, IAQ, lighting, and acoustics), protocols are developed at three levels: low, medium and high cost and accuracy, providing a range of choices for levels of effort, detail, and rigor to characterize the building stock, and comparison to appropriate benchmarks.

For each measure category and each level, the following characteristics are described: 
* Objectives of the measurement. 
* Metrics to be used, including instrumentation and units of measure.  
* Performance evaluation and benchmarks. Estimates of initial and recurring costs are included. 
In the PMP, first the six measure categories are addressed at the basic level. This is followed by a presentation of the intermediate level protocols and then the advanced level protocols. However, here we will primarily discuss the basic level protocols, with only a brief description of higher levels; details of the intermediate and advanced levels are described in the PMP.  

Representative measures at each level were tested by applying them to the newly renovated ASHRAE Headquarters Building in Atlanta (facing page). Measurements were taken by the commissioning authority for the renovation during 2009 and 2010, after the renovated building was reoccupied and was undergoing post-occupancy commissioning. Occupant surveys were taken before and after the renovation to evaluate indoor environmental quality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1753">'''The Consciousness Industry''' is a term coined by author and theorist [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]], which identifies the mechanisms through which the human mind is reproduced as a social product. Foremost among these mechanisms are the institutions of [[mass media]] and [[education]]. According to Enzensberger, the mind industry does not produce anything specific; rather, its main business is to perpetuate the existing order of man's domination over man.

[[Hans Haacke]] elaborates on the consciousness industry as it applies to the arts in a wider system of production, distribution, and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Haacke, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Haacke specifically implicates museums as manufacturers of aesthetic perception that fail to acknowledge their intellectual, political, and [[moral authority]]: "rather than sponsoring intelligent, critical awareness, museums thus tend to foster appeasement."&lt;ref&gt;Haacke, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''DNA field-effect transistor (DNAFET)''' is a [[field-effect transistor]] which uses the field-effect due to the partial charges of [[DNA]] molecules to function as a [[biosensor]]. The structure of DNAFETs is similar to that of MOSFETs with the exception of the gate structure which, in DNAFETs, is replaced by a layer of immobilized ssDNA (single-stranded [[DNA]]) molecules which act as surface receptors. When complementary DNA strands hybridize to the receptors, the charge distribution near the surface changes, which in turn modulates current transport through the semiconductor [[transducer]].

Arrays of DNAFETs can be used for detecting [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (causing many hereditary diseases) and for [[DNA sequencing]]. Their main advantage compared to optical detection methods in common use today is that they do not require labeling of molecules. Furthermore, they work continuously and (near) real-time. DNAFETs are highly selective since only specific binding modulates charge transport.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1773">Historically, [[gas]]es (other than breathable [[air]]) in [[coal mine]]s in [[Great Britain|Britain]] were collectively known as '''"damps"'''. This comes from the [[Middle Low German]] word ''dampf'' (meaning "[[vapour]]"), and was in use by 1480.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Damps included:
* ''[[Afterdamp]]'', a mixture of gases ([[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen]] and others) produced following [[explosion]]s of firedamp or [[coal dust]]
* ''[[Blackdamp]]'', ''stythe'' or ''choke damp'',&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes spelt "choak-damp" in 19thC texts.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Suffocation|suffocating]] mixture of [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/115391 Notes of an Enquiry into the Nature and Physiological Action of Black-Damp, as Met with in Podmore Colliery, Staffordshire, and Lilleshall Colliery, Shropshire], [[John Scott Haldane|John Haldane]], [[Proceedings of the Royal Society of London]], Vol. 57, 1894 - 1895 (1894 - 1895), pp. 249-257&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Firedamp]]'', any mixture of [[flammable]] gases, principally [[methane]]
* ''[[Stinkdamp]]'', usually [[hydrogen sulfide]]; toxic and explosive, but easily detectable by the smell
* ''[[Whitedamp]]'', [[carbon monoxide]], highly dangerous due to being both [[toxic]] and [[explosive]] but having no warning smell.

The term ''damp'' also gives rise to [[wikt:damp_sheet|damp sheet]], a heavy curtain used to direct air currents and prevent the buildup of dangerous gases.

[[File:Dress formSerie1893.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dress forms of 1893]]

A '''dress form''' is a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] model of the [[torso]] used for fitting [[clothes|clothing]] that is being designed or [[sewing|sewed]].  When making a piece of clothing, it can be put on the dress form so one can see the fit and drape of the garment as it would appear on a body, and make adjustments or alterations. Dress forms come in all sizes and shapes for almost every article of clothing that can be made.  Dress forms in standard [[clothing sizes]] are used to make [[pattern (sewing)|patterns]], while adjustable dress forms allow garments to be tailored to fit a specific individual.

This is often colloquially referred to as a ''Judy'' for the female form and a ''James'' for the male.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

In a [[communications network]], a '''drop''' is the portion of a device directly connected to the internal station facilities, such as toward a [[telephone switchboard]], toward a [[switching center]], or toward a [[telephone exchange]]. A drop can also be a wire or cable from a pole or cable terminus to a building, in which case it may be referred to as a '''downlead'''. These cables may be reinforced to withstand the tension (due to gravity and weather) of an aerial drop (i.e., hanging in air), as in "messenger" type [[RG-6]] [[coaxial cable]], which is reinforced with a steel [[messenger wire]] along its length.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3684">An '''electronic centralised aircraft monitor''' (ECAM) is a system that monitors aircraft functions and relays them to the pilots. It also produces messages detailing failures and in certain cases, lists procedures to undertake to correct the problem.

==History==
ECAM is similar to another system, known as [[Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System]] (EICAS), used by [[Boeing]] and [[Embraer]], which displays data concerning aircraft systems and also failures. Airbus developed ECAM, such that it not only provided the features of EICAS, but also displayed corrective action to be taken by the pilot, as well as system limitations after the failures. Using a colour-coded scheme the pilots can instantly assess the situation and decide on the actions to be taken. It was designed to ease pilot stress in abnormal and emergency situations, by designing a paperless [[cockpit]] in which all the procedures are instantly available.

==System design==
ECAM is actually a series of systems designed to work in unison to display information to the pilots in a quick and effective manner. [[Sensor]]s placed throughout the aircraft, monitoring key parameters, feed their data into two System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDACs) which in turn process the data and feed it to two Flight Warning Computers (FWCs). The FWCs check for discrepancies in the data and then display the data on the ECAM displays through the three Display Management Computers (DMCs). In the event of a fault the FWCs generate the appropriate warning messages and sounds. More vital systems are routed directly through the FWCs such that failures in them can still be detected even with the loss of both SDACs. The whole system can continue to operate even with a failure of one SDAC and one FWC.

Failures are classed by importance ranging from level 1 failures to level 3 failures. In the event of simultaneous failures the most critical failure is displayed first. The warning hierarchy is as follows:

* Level 3 Failures: red warnings, situations that require immediate crew action and that place the flight in danger. For example, an engine fire or loss of cabin pressure. They are enunciated with a red master warning light, a warning (red) ECAM message and a continuous repetitive chime or a specific sound or a synthetic voice. The chime can be silenced by pressing the master warning push button.
* Level 2 Failures: amber cautions, failures that require crew attention but not immediate action. For example, air bleed failure or fuel fault. They have no direct consequence to flight safety and are shown to the crew through an amber master caution light, a caution (amber) ECAM message and a single chime.
* Level 1 Failures: Cautions, failures and faults that lead to a loss of system redundancy, they require monitoring but present no hazard. Examples include the loss of DMC3 when not in use. Level 1 failures are enunciated by a caution (amber) ECAM message only (no aural warning).

In addition to the three failure levels are following status messages:

* Advisory: System parameters' monitoring. It causes an automatic call of the relevant system page on the system display (S/D). The affected parameter pulses green.
* MEMO: Information: Recalls normal or automatic selection of functions which are temporarily used. It causes a green, amber, or magenta message on engine warning display (E/WD).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14075">In the electronics industry, '''embedded instrumentation''' refers to the integration of test and measurement instrumentation into semiconductor chips (or [[integrated circuit]] devices). Embedded instrumentation differs from [[embedded system]], which are electronic systems or subsystems that usually comprise the control portion of a larger electronic system. Instrumentation embedded into chips (embedded instrumentation) is employed in a variety of electronic test applications, including validating and testing chips themselves, validating, testing and debugging the circuit boards where these chips are deployed, and troubleshooting systems once they have been installed in the field.

A working group of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) that is developing a standard for accessing embedded instruments (the IEEE 1687 Internal JTAG standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IEEE Standards  Association |url=https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1687-2014.html |publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;) defines embedded instrumentation as follows:

''Any logic structure within a device whose purpose is [[Design for Test]] (DFT), Design-for-Debug (DFD), Design-for-Yield (DFY), Test… There exists the widespread use of embedded instrumentation (such as BIST ([[built-in self-test]]) Engines, Complex I/O Characterization and Calibration, Embedded Timing Instrumentation, etc.). ''&lt;ref name="IJTAG Standard web site"&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE 1687 IJTAG Standard Statement of Work|url=https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1687-2014.html|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=1 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

Dating back to as early as the 1990s, the electronics industry recognized that design validation, test and debug would be seriously impeded in the near future. Initially, the impetus behind this recognition and the subsequent development of solutions was the emergence of new semiconductor chip packages such as the [[ball grid array]] (BGA) which placed the device’s pins beneath the silicon die, making them inaccessible to physical contact with an instrument’s or a test system’s metal probes. At that time, most test instruments, such as the [[oscilloscope]] and logic analyzers in design, and [[in-circuit test]] (ICT) in volume manufacturing were external to the chips and circuit boards. They relied upon placing a probe on a chip or a circuit board to obtain test data. To overcome the disappearing access for test probes, instrumentation technology began to be embedded into semiconductors and onto printed circuit boards.

In recent years, this situation has been exacerbated by increasingly high-speed serial inter-chip connections (interconnects or buses) on circuit boards as well as by even more complex chip packaging technologies like [[system-on-a-chip]] (SOC), [[system-in-package]] (SIP) and [[package-on-package]] (POP). These and other developments are making instrumentation embedded into chips a necessity for design validation, test and debug processes.

== The Boundary Scan Standard (IEEE 1149.1 JTAG): The Enabling Technology for Embedded Instrumentation ==

Although it was not referred to as an embedded instrument at the time of its development, the IEEE 1149.1 [[Boundary Scan]] Standard &lt;ref name="Boundary Scan Standard doc"&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE 1149.1 Boundary-Scan Standard|url=http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/testtech/1149.1-1990_desc.html|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  can be seen as the first enabling technology for embedded instrumentation. (Boundary scan is also referred to as [[JTAG]], after the Joint Test Action Group which initially undertook its development before it came under the aegis of a working group of the IEEE. ‘JTAG’ is often used to designate the access port on a chip which conforms to the boundary-scan standard.) Some would consider the boundary-scan test process as a form of embedded instrumentation. Boundary scan involves embedding an instrumentation infrastructure into chips and onto circuit boards. This infrastructure can be utilized during design debug and first prototype board bring-up, volume manufacturing and field service to test and diagnose the structural integrity of electrical connections on circuit boards. In addition, the boundary scan infrastructure can also be applied to the programming of devices such as memories, [[complex programmable logic devices]] (CPLDs) and [[Field-programmable gate arrays]] (FPGAs) after they have been soldered to a circuit board.

== Related Standards ==

In the intervening years since the development of boundary-scan standard as a structural test technology, the embedded boundary-scan infrastructure in chips and on circuit boards has been appropriated for a number of related applications, including as an access method to the instrumentation inserted in chips. A later standard in the boundary-scan family, the IEEE 1149.6 Boundary-Scan Standard for Advanced Digital Networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE 1149.6 Boundary-Scan Standard for Advanced Digital Networks|url=http://electronics.ihs.com/document/abstract/CJESCBAAAAAAAAAA|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilizes the 1149.1 boundary-scan embedded instrumentation infrastructure but expands the types of chip-to-chip interconnects that can be tested. Whereas the 1149.1 standard defines a methodology for testing DC-coupled interconnects, the 1149.6 version of the boundary-scan standard extends the methodology to testing high-speed AC coupled and/or differential interconnects.

Another addition to the boundary-scan family of standards has been IEEE 1149.7, which defines a reduced pin-count interface and provides for enhanced software debug. In addition, IEEE 1149.7 is expected to be used in the testing of complex chips with multiple die stacked in one package.

A working group of the IEEE has also undertaken the development of a standard that specifically addresses embedded instrumentation. The official name of this standard is the IEEE 1687 Standard for Access and Control of Instrumentation Embedded within a Semiconductor Device, but it is commonly referred to as the Internal JTAG (IJTAG) standard.&lt;ref name="IJTAG standard"&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE 1687 IJTAG Standard for Embedded Instruments|url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1687/HW_Post_Vote_r7_BW.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the working group has been to define a technology for automating, accessing and analyzing the output of embedded instruments. Standardizing the interface to embedded instruments means that these instruments could come from any number of sources, but user interaction would be simplified since this would be based on an industry-accepted standard. The actual embedded instruments could be developed by any of several different types of groups, including chip suppliers, third-party providers, chip design tool vendors or in-house design groups. The availability of chips that conform to the IEEE 1687 standard would encourage the development of standards-based tools for interacting with and utilizing the instrumentation embedded in the chips. The IEEE 1687 standard is now a ratified standard.

== The emergence of embedded instrumentation ==

Embedded instrumentation can perform certain functions that external test and measurement technologies have difficulty with because they are external to the chip or circuit board being tested. Moreover, embedded instrumentation is often more efficient and adaptable, since it is software-based, unlike external hardware testers. In addition, embedded instrumentation is simply better suited to much of the computer and communications technologies that are emerging today.

Some of the more traditional test and measurement technologies are only able to measure performance and data flow at the [[input/output]] (I/O) point on a chip. The real challenge is for the instrument to gain visibility into the processing that is going on inside the core silicon itself. To do this, embedded instruments are needed between the I/O point on the perimeter of the chip and the processing core.

The following are some of the difficulties that traditional test and measurement instruments are running into as chips, circuit boards and systems continue to become faster, smaller and more complex.
*The signaling on high-speed serial buses like PCI Express, Fibre Channel 10-Gbit/s Ethernet, InfiniBand or Intel®’s QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) is very sensitive to capacitive coupling effects. As a result, placing a test pad on one of these buses to provide access to the test probes that external instruments such as oscilloscopes and in-circuit test systems rely on will disrupt the integrity of signals on the underlying bus. As a result, today’s best practices for designing circuit boards call for the elimination of test pads, which restricts the use of test probes. The alternative is embedded instruments which are able to test from the inside out.  
*Semiconductor vendors are incorporating [[signaling conditioning]] features such as pre-conditioning, [[pre-emphasis]] and [[equalization (communications)|equalization]] into their devices to help move signals at higher frequencies. Unfortunately, these techniques make it more difficult for traditional external instruments to take accurate measurements. 
*Sub-100 nanometer chip fabrication processes have dramatic effects on device-level parametric performance characteristics to the extent that traditional characterization and testing techniques are often ineffective at identifying problems. External instruments at the corners of a chip cannot see the variations across the chip. On-chip or embedded instruments can effectively monitor parametric characteristics such as thermal conditions, timing issues, clock propagation delays, power distribution and others.
*External instruments typically only measure signal integrity margins on one or a few high-speed serial lanes at a time. Embedded instrumentation technologies such as Intel’s IBIST&lt;ref name="Intel IBIST"&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel IBIST and QuickPath Interconnect|url=http://www.intel.com/technology/quickpath/introduction.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Interconnect Built-In Self Test) can test and measure all lanes on all buses concurrently. This makes the test more robust and more complete, and it reduces the amount of time required to validate the system.
*Embedded instrumentation can perform design validation, test and debug routines that external validation and test technologies cannot. An example of this would be Intel’s IBIST technology which can stress and thereby test high-speed I/O buses well beyond the capabilities of traditional testing techniques that are applied through an operating system.

== Embedded instrumentation applications ==

The applications for embedded instrumentation are extensive. At the level of circuit boards, two of the most prominent applications are design validation and non-intrusive board test.

===Chip and Circuit Board Design Validation===

Instruments are being embedded into chips and utilized to validate circuit board designs. This sort of design validation can make use of a variety of embedded instruments such as bit error rate test (BERT) engines, BIST) for logic devices, margining engines, memory BIST, memory test, random pattern generators and a complete [[logic analyzer]]. Deployed in design validation applications, these embedded instruments may function inside the chip or across on-board chip-to-chip interconnects to validate the performance and functionality of a circuit board design before it moves into volume production.

===Non-Intrusive Board Test===

Non-intrusive board test (NBT) employs embedded instrumentation to perform structural and electrical tests on circuit boards. In addition to boundary scan, other types of NBT methods include processor-controlled test (PCT) and FPGA-controlled test (FCT). See below for more on these methodologies.

=== Embedded instrumentation methodologies ===

As mentioned above, the IEEE 1149.1 Boundary-Scan Standard could be seen as the first enabler of embedded instrumentation and, as such, the first embedded instrumentation methodology. In addition to providing the infrastructure for accessing and operating embedded instruments, tests that utilize the boundary scan infrastructure can be applied to circuit boards to identify structural defects such as shorts and opens. Several other methodologies also apply tests that are initiated by embedded instruments. 
*High-speed I/O (HSIO):  In particular, Intel  Corporation has developed embedded instrumentation technology which it is placing in all of its advanced processors. This can be employed to validate signal integrity on the high-speed buses in the Intel® Architecture (IA).  
*Processor-controlled test (PCT): PCT takes advantage of the debug port on most processor chips and asserts test and diagnostic routines on other elements on the circuit board, such as devices and the chip-to-chip buses. 
*FPGA-controlled test (FCT):' Instruments are temporarily embedded into a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device on a circuit board to accomplish FCT tests. The types of tests performed will depend on the test functionality of the instruments embedded into the FPGA. Once the tests have been completed, the FCT embedded instruments can be removed and operating firmware loaded into the FPGA.

[[File:EBS Test Screen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Video slide used by [[KEYC-TV]] in [[Mankato, Minnesota]] to announce an EBS test, c. 1990.]]
The '''Emergency Broadcast System''' ('''EBS'''), occasionally called the '''Emergency Broadcasting System''' and sometimes called the '''Emergency Action Notification System (EANS)''', was an [[Emergency population warning|emergency warning system]] used in the [[United States]]. It replaced the previous [[CONELRAD]] system and was used from 1963 to 1997, at which point it was replaced by the [[Emergency Alert System]].

==Purpose==
"The system was established to provide the [[President of the United States]] with an expeditious method of communicating with the American public in the event of war, threat of war, or grave national crisis."&lt;ref name="lifesaving"&gt;{{Citation | title=Emergency Broadcast System: The Lifesaving Public Service Program | date=March 1978 | publisher= United States Defense Civil Preparedness Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emergency Broadcast System replaced [[CONELRAD]] on August 5, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= | first= | author-link= | title=City's Civil Defense Sirens Will Be Tested Tomorrow | newspaper=The New York Times | publication-place=New York, NY | volume= | issue= | date=October 5, 1963 | page=30 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, it was expanded for use during peacetime emergencies at the state and local levels.&lt;ref name="lifesaving"/&gt;

Although the system was never used for a national emergency, it was activated more than 20,000 times{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} between 1976 and 1996 to broadcast civil emergency messages and warnings of severe weather hazards.

== National Level EBS ==
An order to activate the EBS at the national level would have originated with the [[President of the United States|President]] and been relayed via the [[White House Communications Agency]] duty officer to one of two origination points – either the [[Aerospace Defense Command]] (ADC) or the Federal Preparedness Agency (FPA) – as the system stood in 1978. Participating telecommunications [[common carrier]]s, [[radio network|radio]] and [[television network]]s, the [[Associated Press]], and [[United Press International]] would receive and authenticate (by means of code words) an [[Emergency Action Notification]] (EAN) via an EAN teletypewriter network designed specifically for this purpose. These recipients would relay the EAN to their subscribers and affiliates.&lt;ref name="lifesaving"/&gt;

The release of the EAN by the Aerospace Defense Command or the Federal Preparedness Agency would initiate a process by which the common carriers would link otherwise independent networks such as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[NBC]] into a single national network from which even [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] could receive programming. "Broadcast stations would have used the two-tone Attention Signal on their assigned broadcast frequency to alert other broadcast stations to stand by for a message from the President."&lt;ref name="lifesaving"/&gt; The transmission of programming on a broadcast station's assigned frequency, and the fact that television networks/stations and FM radio stations could participate, distinguished EBS from CONELRAD. EBS radio stations would not necessarily transmit on 640 or 1240 on the AM dial, and FM radio and television would carry the same audio program as AM radio stations did.

==Activation procedure==
Actual activations originated with a primary station, which would transmit the {{Audio|Emergency broadcast system.ogg|Attention Signal}}. The Attention Signal most commonly associated with the system was a combination of the sine waves of 853 and 960 [[Hertz|Hz]]{{mdashb}}suited to attention due to its unpleasantness. Decoders at relay stations would sound an alarm, alerting station personnel to the incoming message. Then, each relay station would broadcast the alert tone and rebroadcast the emergency message from the primary station. The Attention Signal was developed in the mid-1960s.

A nationwide activation of the EBS was called an Emergency Action Notification (EAN), and was the only activation that stations were not allowed to ignore; the [[Federal Communications Commission]] made local civil emergencies,  weather advisories optional (except for stations that agreed to be the "primary" source of such messages).

To activate the EAN protocol, the [[Associated Press]] and [[United Press International]] [[wire service]]s would notify stations with a special message. It began with a full [[Bell character|line of X's, and a bell]] inside the [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] machine would sound ten times. To avoid abuse and mistakes, the message included a confirmation password which changed daily. Stations that subscribed to one of the wire services were not required to activate the EBS if the activation message did not have proper confirmation.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==False alarm of 1971==
A properly authenticated Emergency Action Notification was incorrectly sent to United States broadcast stations at 9:33&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] on February 20, 1971.&lt;ref name=conel&gt;{{cite web|title=Code Word "Hatefulness": The Great EBS Scare of 1971|url=http://conelrad.blogspot.com/2010/09/code-word-hatefulness-great-ebs-scare.html|publisher=CONELRAD Adjacent|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the usual time a weekly EAN test is performed, NORAD teletype operator W. S. Eberhardt had three tapes in front of him: a test tape, and two tapes indicating a real emergency, instructing the use of EAN Message #1, and #2, respectively. He inadvertently used the wrong tape, with codeword "HATEFULNESS". This message ordered stations to cease regular programming immediately, and begin an Emergency Action Notification using Message #1.&lt;ref&gt;(Timestamp to WCCO white card script instruction) {{Citation|last=2001scoop, W6LDS|title=1971 False Emergency Broadcast System EAN (Heard On WOWO-AM And WCCO-AM)|date=2012-09-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B1EAeh6H_I&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=384|accessdate=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016190942/http://ebstest.stlmedia.net/pix/ebsaccident1.jpg|title=EAN Teletype message (February 20, 1971 09:33 EST)|last=|first=|date=2014-10-16|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Message 1 states that regular programming has been interrupted at the request of the United States government, but is not specific about the cause.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ae5d.com/ebs.html|title=The EBS Authenticator Word List|website=www.ae5d.com|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cancellation message was sent at 9:59&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST, but it used an incorrect codeword.&lt;ref name="ebstest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121195955/http://ebstest.stlmedia.net/|title=The Great Accidental Test Broadcast of 1971|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cancellation message with the ''correct'' codeword, "IMPISH", was not sent until 10:13&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST&lt;ref name="ebstest" /&gt; After 40 minutes and six incorrect or improperly formatted cancellation messages, the accidental activation was officially terminated.

This [[false alarm]] demonstrated major flaws in the practical implementation of an EAN. Over 2,500 radio and television stations received the notification.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/38855312|title=Small Piece Of Tape Stirs U.S. Emotions|last=AP|first=|date=1971-02-21|work=The Lawton Constitution and Morning Press|access-date=2018-05-22|page=12A|at=|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stations ignored it (convinced it was false because it came at the time of a scheduled test) and continued with regular programming. Others cancelled the EAN prematurely, with or without an any coded indication that the alert was erroneous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Still other stations did not have EAN procedure documents readily accessible to them, so they had no indication of what to do at all.&lt;ref name="ebstest" /&gt; It is estimated that only 20% of the stations that received the activation followed the procedures completely.&lt;ref name="conel" /&gt; Several stations went off the air, as they were instructed to do. Recordings from stations that did not (and were not supposed to according to EAN procedures) include one from [[WOWO (AM)|WOWO]] in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], [http://historyofwowo.com/audio/WOWO-Bob%20SieversEBS_02-20-1971_scoped.mp3 for which a recording of the EAN activation exists]. Another recording of the EAN activation on [[WCCO (AM)|WCCO]] in [[Minneapolis]]/[[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] can be heard on [http://radiotapes.com/specialpostings.html RadioTapes.com].

This false alarm was sufficiently disruptive to move the FCC to temporarily suspend use and testing of Emergency Action Notifications (EANs) by codeword effective February 25, 1971. In the meantime, a national EBS activation (actual or test) would be routed through news service broadcast desks, then authenticated with the White House communications center, introducing a delay of approximately one minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/277872316|title=Automatic Takeover of News Services Suspended by FCC|last=AP|first=|date=1971-02-26|work=The News-Item|access-date=2018-05-22|page=8|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous investigations were launched, and several changes were made to the EBS. Among them, EAN Message #2, which contains specific language indicating an imminent attack,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; was eliminated. Another change was moving the tapes for genuine alerts away from the broadcasting machines to prevent them being mistaken for the weekly test tapes. After numerous safeguards were put in place, the FCC voted to resume automatic national activation of the EBS using EANs in mid-December, 1972, almost 20 months after they were suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/385761176|title=The Nation|last=|first=|date=1972-12-15|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-05-22|page=2|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== System uses ==
[[Image:WGN EBS EAN.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Video slide from a prerecorded announcement of the beginning of an EAN from [[WGN-TV]], [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], in 1985, during the period of the Emergency Broadcast System. This EAN announcement was never seen on the airwaves of WGN-TV itself, but was posted to [[YouTube]] in March 2017.]]
Though it was never used, the FCC's EBS plan involved detailed procedures for stations to follow during an EAN. It included precise scripts that announcers were to read at the outset of the emergency, as well as whenever detailed information was scarce. Among other things, citizens were instructed not to use the telephone, but rather continue listening to broadcast stations for information.

The initial scripted announcement was: "We interrupt this program. This is a national emergency. The President of the United States or his designated representative will appear shortly over the Emergency Broadcast System."

As official information began to emerge from various sources, non-primary stations were to broadcast it according to the following priority list:
* Messages from the [[President of the United States]]
* Statewide emergency information
* Local emergency information (for a station's operational area, i.e. evacuation and sheltering plans, and [[severe weather]])
* National programming and news (other than a presidential message)

A presidential message was always required to be aired live during an EAN. For other information, stations were to follow the priority list to decide what should be disseminated first. Lower priority official programming was to be recorded for the earliest available rebroadcast.

Participation in EAN emergency broadcasting was done with the "voluntary cooperation" of each station (as noted in the classic test announcement). Stations that were not prepared to be part of the national EBS network were classified as "non-participating" by the FCC. During an EAN, a non-participating station was required to advise listeners/viewers to tune elsewhere to find emergency bulletins. The station's transmitter would then be turned off. Non-participating stations had to remain off the air until the EAN was terminated. Under no circumstances could any broadcast station continue with normal programming during a national emergency.

==Testing the system==
Until the system was superseded, radio and television stations were required to perform a ''Weekly Transmission Test Of The Attention Signal and Test Script'' at random days and times between 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and local sunset. Stations were required to perform the test at least once a week, and were only exempt from doing so if they had activated the EBS for a state or local emergency, or participated in a coordinated state or local EBS test during the past week. Additionally, stations were required to log tests they received from each station they monitored for EBS messages. This served as an additional check, as these stations could expect to hear a weekly test from each source. Failure to receive a signal at least once a week meant that either the monitored station was having a problem transmitting the alert signal, or the monitoring station was having a problem receiving it.

===Original plan===
Early on, tests and activations were initiated in a similar way to CONELRAD tests. Primary stations would turn their transmitters off for five seconds, back on for five seconds, off for five seconds more, then would go back on air and transmit a 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz tone for 15 seconds to alert secondary stations. Television stations adhere to similar rules, but stations switch only their sound carriers off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic Emergency Broadcast System Plan|date=4 August 1967|publisher=Department of Defense|location=Washington, DC|page=33|edition=First Revision|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/80541666/Emergency-Broadcast-System-1967|accessdate=27 October 2017|quote=Sound carrier only for TV stations}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quick off-and-on became known to broadcast engineers as the "EBS Stress Test", as older transmitters would sometimes fail after the quick cycling on and off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldradio.com/current/bc_conel.htm Broadcast History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This became unnecessary as broadcast technology advanced and the two-tone alarm was developed.

===Later test pattern===
Beginning in 1976, the old CONELRAD signaling method (the "EBS Stress Test") was scrapped in favor of the following procedure:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmu.edu/wmra/eas/stuff/94-288.txt], ''FCC Report and Order 94-288, Paragraph II(4), Nov 10 1994, accessed August 15, 2011.''&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Normal programming was suspended, though tests were typically done during commercial breaks for continuity reasons. Television stations would transmit a video slide such as the one illustrated at the beginning of the article; numerous designs were available over the years. One of the following announcements was transmitted:

*"''This is a test. For the next sixty'' (or thirty) ''seconds, this station will conduct a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test.''"
*"(name of host station in a particular market) ''is conducting a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test.''" (mainly radio stations used this particular announcement)
*"''This is a test. (Name of Host Station) is conducting a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test."''
*"''This is a test. This station is conducting a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test."''
*"''This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test.''"
*"''The following is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System."''
*"''This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. Important information will follow this tone.''"

Alternatively, the name "Emergency Broadcasting System" could be used.

2. The Attention Signal was transmitted from the EBS encoder for 20 to 25 seconds. At the special request of the FCC, however, this step was occasionally (though rarely) skipped.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In mid-1995, a new rule was put in place that gave stations the option to transmit the attention signal for anywhere from eight to 25 seconds.

3. The announcement written below (depending on the variation) was transmitted. The first part read:
*"''This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. The broadcasters of your area in voluntary cooperation with the FCC and other authorities'' (or, in later years, "federal, state and local authorities") ''have developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an emergency.''"
*"''This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. Broadcasters, in cooperation with the FCC and other authorities'' (or, in later years, "federal, state and local authorities") ''have developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an emergency.''"

There were a number of variations for the second half of the statement. During the system's early days, stations other than the designated primary station for an operational area were required to shut down in the event of an emergency (reminiscent of the CONELRAD days), and the message was a variation of:
*"''If this had been an actual emergency, you would have been instructed to tune to one of the broadcast stations in your area.''"
*"''If this had been an actual emergency, you would have been instructed where to tune in your area for news and official information.''"

By the early 1980s, it was easier for stations to record and relay messages from a primary station, and the risk of hostile bombers using broadcast signals to navigate lessened due to the development of [[ICBM]]s. As a result, the requirement to shut down during an activation of the system was dropped, and the message became:
*"''If this had been an actual emergency, the Attention Signal you just heard would have been followed by official information, news, or instructions."

Some stations also listed  the types of emergencies that the EBS would be activated for (i.e., [[tornado warning]], [[flash flood warning]], [[hurricane warning]], or [[earthquake]]); the test conducted by [[WXYZ-TV]] made explicit reference to an attack on the United States as being a possible scenario for EBS activation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnsQTd7jrE&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, several television stations in the [[Los Angeles]] area had specific test scripts that emphasized earthquake preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlhnDUra4p8&lt;/ref&gt;

As the EBS was about to be replaced by its successor, the [[Emergency Alert System]], some stations used the following message:
*"''This station is testing its Emergency Broadcast System equipment. The EBS will soon be replaced with the Emergency Alert System; the EAS will provide timely emergency warnings.''"

4. The test concluded with one of the following phrases:
*"(Sponsoring station) ''serves'' (the name of operational area). ''This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System.''" 
* "Stations of the (name of the station [[public broadcasting]] network, for example: ''South Dakota Public Broadcasting Network'') ''serve all operational areas in'' (name of state). ''This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System.''" (used mostly by statewide [[public television]] and/or radio networks)
*"''This station serves the'' (name of operational area). ''This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System.''"
*"This station ''serves'' (the name of operational area). ''This concludes this Emergency Broadcast System Test.''" (mainly used by stations that used the ''This Station is testing its Emergency Broadcast System equipment'' variant)
*"''This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System serving the'' (name of operational area).''"
*"''This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System on'' (name of station).''"

These variations were heard in different parts of the country throughout the years depending on FCC regulations at the time, local preferences, and whether the specific station performing the test was a primary EBS station or not. The announcement text was mandated by the FCC. Stations had the option of either reading the test script live, or using recorded versions. [[WHEN (AM)|WHEN]] radio in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[WGR]] radio in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York both had a sung version of the most common script.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YRHAro1iTE&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a version done by Los Angeles-based Cheap Radio Thrills, as well as another by the comedy team of [[Bob and Ray]]. The FCC declared it illegal to sing the test message, or read it as a joke. However, it was acceptable to read it in another language (for example, [[French language|French]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), if a station broadcast in a language other than [[English language|English]]. Copies of the [[Emergency Action Notification|warning message script]] had a note saying that it was acceptable to broadcast in any other language, so long as it was broadcast in English as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ae5d.com/images/EBS-29zx.png The attack warning script has a note that says it can be read out in any language other than English, if it broadcasts in that language.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the post-test recorded announcement began with the phrase, "This has been a test of the Emergency Broadcast System...", followed by the here-in-above stated recitations.

=== Purpose of the test and cultural impact===
The purpose of the test was to allow the FCC and broadcasters to verify that EBS tone transmitters and decoders were functioning properly. In addition to the weekly test, test activations of the entire system were conducted periodically for many years. These tests showed that about 80% of broadcast outlets nationwide would carry emergency programming within a period of five minutes when the system was activated.

The weekly broadcasts of the EBS attention signal and test script made it a significant part of the American cultural fabric of its time, and became the subject of a great number of jokes and skits, such as the sung versions of the test script in the late 1970s. In addition, many people have testified to being frightened by the test patterns and attention signal as children.

==Criticism==
Although intended for the President to communicate with the American people in the event of a national emergency, many critics questioned whether the EBS would work in an actual emergency scenario. Curt Beckmann of [[WCCO-AM]] expressed his doubts about the system's effectiveness in a 1984 interview:

{{quote|I'll tell you why it probably wouldn't work, because if the President has a national emergency, he will call in the national radio and television networks, and presto, he will communicate with us. If those networks are somehow incapacitated, and he has to go to the EBS as a backup, it's inconceivable the rest of us will be up and running if the networks aren't up and running.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6Pi6jlpV64&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2990">During the mid-1980s the company '''FlowTex''' was established by [[Mandred Schmider]] and [[Klaus Kleiser]], two businessmen based in the South-Western state of [[Baden-Wuerttemberg]], with the purpose of constructing and operating machines for [[horizontal drilling]]. The business idea was profitable and successful as it allowed for the installation of cables and pipes without the need to dig up roads, which would have caused considerable traffic chaos and noise pollution. By the year 2000, the two men had sold more than 3,000 machines, each at around 1.5 million Deutsche Marks.&lt;ref name=FlowTex&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.facworld.com/FACworld.nsf/9d94750abebbb81985256804005d50ea/4c8dbb9a5d6eb56a85256ac5005a6e9f/$FILE/d&amp;oeurope.pdf| title=General Cologne Re: Loss and Litigation Report | author=General Cologne Re| publisher= General Cologne Re | date=August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandal==

What started as a legal business with a viable model soon turned into large-scale fraud; in reality, FlowTex had only produced 181 machines that were sold multiple times, with the certificates and identification plates manipulated according to the scam. At one point, the same machine was paraded at various different fake construction sites to potential investors during the same inspection; it later emerged that they had moved the machine from one location to another during lunch breaks.&lt;ref name=FlowTex/&gt; Over a period of ten years or so, they secured loans worth more than two billion Euros for non-existent drilling systems and the scam is widely tipped as Germany’s largest ever case of [[white-collar crime]].&lt;ref name=Crime&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.organized-crime.de/kvlECPRNL0309.pdf| title=Assessing Organized Crime: The Case of Germany | author=Klaus Von Lampe| publisher=ECPR Standing Group eNewsletter Organised Crime| date=September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentencing and Aftermath===

The scam was aided by a network of co-conspirators that included family, friends and employees of the firm, but ultimately it was Schmider and Kleiser who paid the largest price for their crimes; they were both arrested in February 2000 on suspicion of fraud and tax evasion, four years after the authorities were allegedly first tipped off about the fraudulent business practices.&lt;ref name=Crime/&gt; This apparent lack of determination to follow up on the leads was allegedly partly due to concerns that such investigations would jeopardise jobs and compromise leading politicians who had courted the FlowTex directors as model businessmen. Also suspicious was the fact that the tax inspector assigned to FlowTex was a tennis partner of one of the FlowTex directors. However, to date there have been no indications that the FlowTex management or any politicians tried to directly influence the proceedings.

'''Förster resonance energy transfer''' ('''FRET'''), '''fluorescence resonance energy transfer''' ('''FRET'''), '''resonance energy transfer''' ('''RET''') or '''electronic energy transfer''' ('''EET''') is a mechanism describing energy transfer between two light-sensitive molecules ([[chromophore]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ping-Chin |last1=Cheng |chapter=The Contrast Formation in Optical Microscopy |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2maxdEXFNoC&amp;pg=PA162 |pages=162–206 |editor1-last=Pawley |editor1-first=James B. |title=Handbook Of Biological Confocal Microscopy |date=2006 |publisher=Springer |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-387-25921-5 |edition=3rd |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-45524-2_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A donor chromophore, initially in its electronic excited state, may transfer energy to an acceptor chromophore through nonradiative [[dipole–dipole coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helms |first=Volkhard |chapter=Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Tavvybv5UwC&amp;pg=PA202 |title=Principles of Computational Cell Biology |date=2008 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |isbn=978-3-527-31555-0 |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of this energy transfer is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between donor and acceptor, making FRET extremely sensitive to small changes in distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Daniel C. |chapter=Applications of Spectrophotometry |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIgLJ1De_jwC&amp;pg=PA419 |title=Quantitative Chemical Analysis |date=2010 |publisher=W.

Measurements of FRET efficiency can be used to determine if two [[fluorophore]]s are within a certain distance of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zheng |first=Jie |chapter=Spectroscopy-Based Quantitative Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Analysis |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2k-T_1DPcwC&amp;pg=PA65 |title=Ion Channels: Methods and Protocols |series=Methods in Molecular Biology, Volume 337 |date=2006 |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |isbn=978-1-59745-095-9 |pages=65–77 |editor1-first=James D. |editor1-last=Stockand |editor2-first=Mark S. |editor2-last=Shapiro |doi=10.1385/1-59745-095-2:65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such measurements are used as a research tool in fields including biology and chemistry.

FRET is analogous to [[Near and far field|near-field]] [[Near field communication|communication]], in that the radius of interaction is much smaller than the [[Light|wavelength]] of light emitted. In the near-field region, the excited chromophore emits a [[virtual photon]] that is instantly absorbed by a receiving chromophore. These virtual photons are undetectable, since their existence violates the conservation of energy and momentum, and hence FRET is known as a ''radiationless'' mechanism. [[Quantum electrodynamics|Quantum electrodynamical]] calculations have been used to determine that radiationless (FRET) and [[radiative transfer|radiative energy transfer]] are the short- and long-range [[asymptote]]s of a single unified mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0301-0104(89)87019-3 |title=A unified theory of radiative and radiationless molecular energy transfer |date=1989 |last1=Andrews |first1=David L. |journal=Chemical Physics |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=195–201 |bibcode=1989CP....135..195A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/25/6/017 |title=Virtual photons, dipole fields and energy transfer: A quantum electrodynamical approach |year=2004 |last1=Andrews |first1=David L |last2=Bradshaw |first2=David S |journal=European Journal of Physics |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=845–858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[Image:Concept of FRET.png|thumb|300px|right|Cartoon diagram of the concept of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).]]

Förster resonance energy transfer is named after the German scientist [[Theodor Förster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/andp.19484370105 |title=Zwischenmolekulare Energiewanderung und Fluoreszenz |trans-title=Intermolecular energy migration and fluorescence |date=1948 |last1=Förster |first1=Theodor |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=437 |bibcode=1948AnP...437...55F |pages=55–75 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; When both chromophores are fluorescent, the term "fluorescence resonance energy transfer" is often used instead, although the energy is not actually transferred by [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]].&lt;ref name="Wiley-VCH"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Bernard |last1=Valeur |first2=Mario |last2=Berberan-Santos |chapter=Excitation Energy Transfer|title=Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications, 2nd ed. |date=2012 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |isbn=9783527328376 |pages=213–261 |doi=10.1002/9783527650002.ch8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympusfluoview.com/applications/fretintro.html FRET microscopy tutorial from Olympus] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120629220328/http://www.olympusfluoview.com/applications/fretintro.html |date=2012-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid an erroneous interpretation of the phenomenon that is always a nonradiative transfer of energy (even when occurring between two fluorescent chromophores), the name "Förster resonance energy transfer" is preferred to "fluorescence resonance energy transfer"; however, the latter enjoys common usage in scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Glossary of Terms Used in Photochemistry |edition=3rd |date=2007 |publisher=IUPAC |page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that FRET is not restricted to fluorescence. It can occur in connection with phosphorescence as well.&lt;ref name="Wiley-VCH"/&gt;

==Theoretical basis==
The FRET efficiency (&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;) is the [[quantum yield]] of the energy transfer transition, i.e. the fraction of energy transfer event occurring per donor excitation event:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moens|first=Pierre|title=Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer spectroscopy|url=http://www.anatomy.usyd.edu.au/mru/fret/abot.html#frete|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{k_\text{ET}}{k_f+k_\text{ET}+\sum{k_i}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_\text{ET}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of energy transfer, &lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt; the radiative decay rate, and the &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; are the rate constants of any other de-excitation pathways.&lt;ref name=SchaufeleDemarcoDay2005p72-94&gt;{{cite book |first1=Fred |last1=Schaufele |first2=Ignacio |last2=Demarco |first3=Richard N. |last3=Day |chapter=FRET Imaging in the Wide-Field Microscope |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0aawJ6sX-sC&amp;pg=PA72 |pages=72–94 |editor1-first=Ammasi |editor1-last=Periasamy |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Day |date=2005 |title=Molecular Imaging: FRET Microscopy and Spectroscopy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-517720-6 |doi=10.1016/B978-019517720-6.50013-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FRET efficiency depends on many physical parameters that can be grouped as 1) the distance between the donor and the acceptor (typically in the range of 1–10&amp;nbsp;nm), 2) the spectral overlap of the donor [[emission spectrum]] and the acceptor [[absorption spectrum]], and 3) the relative orientation of the donor emission [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] and the acceptor absorption dipole moment.

&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; depends on the donor-to-acceptor separation distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with an inverse 6th-power law due to the dipole-dipole coupling mechanism:
: &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{1+(r/R_0)^6}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; being the Förster distance of this pair of donor and acceptor, i.e. the distance at which the energy transfer efficiency is 50%.&lt;ref name=SchaufeleDemarcoDay2005p72-94/&gt;
The Förster distance depends on the overlap [[integral]] of the donor emission spectrum with the acceptor absorption spectrum and their mutual molecular orientation as expressed by the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Förster | first1 = Th. | title = Modern Quantum Chemistry.

where &lt;math&gt;Q_\text{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the fluorescence [[quantum yield]] of the donor in the absence of the acceptor, &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; is the dipole orientation factor, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]] of the medium, &lt;math&gt;N_\text{A}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Avogadro's number]], and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the spectral overlap integral calculated as

where &lt;math&gt;f_\text{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the donor emission spectrum, &lt;math&gt;\overline{f_\text{D}}&lt;/math&gt; is the donor emission spectrum normalized to an area of 1, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\text{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceptor [[molar extinction coefficient]] normally obtained from an absorption spectrum.&lt;ref name="Demchenko2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Demchenko |first=Alexander P. |chapter=Fluorescence Detection Techniques |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMARxPxkE7EC&amp;pg=PA65 |title=Introduction to Fluorescence Sensing |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-1-4020-9002-8 |pages=65–118 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9003-5_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The orientation factor ''κ'' is given by
: &lt;math&gt; \kappa = \hat\mu_\text{A} \cdot \hat\mu_\text{D} - 3 (\hat\mu_\text{D} \cdot \hat R) (\hat\mu_\text{A} \cdot \hat R), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the normalized transition dipole moment of the respective fluorophore, and &lt;math&gt;\hat R&lt;/math&gt; denotes the normalized inter-fluorophore displacement.
&lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; = 2/3 is often assumed. This value is obtained when both dyes are freely rotating and can be considered to be isotropically oriented during the excited state lifetime. If either dye is fixed or not free to rotate, then &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; = 2/3 will not be a valid assumption. In most cases, however, even modest reorientation of the dyes results in enough orientational averaging that &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; = 2/3 does not result in a large error in the estimated energy transfer distance due to the sixth-power dependence of &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt;. Even when &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; is quite different from 2/3, the error can be associated with a shift in &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt;, and thus determinations of changes in relative distance for a particular system are still valid. Fluorescent proteins do not reorient on a timescale that is faster than their fluorescence lifetime. In this case 0 ≤ &lt;math&gt;\kappa^2&lt;/math&gt; ≤ 4.&lt;ref name="Demchenko2008" /&gt;

The FRET efficiency relates to the quantum yield and the fluorescence lifetime of the donor molecule as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Irina |last1=Majoul |first2=Yiwei |last2=Jia |first3=Rainer |last3=Duden |chapter=Practical Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer or Molecular Nanobioscopy of Living Cells |pages=788–808 |editor-last=Pawley |editor1-first=James B. |title=Handbook Of Biological Confocal Microscopy |date=2006 |publisher=Springer |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-387-25921-5 |edition=3rd |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-45524-2_45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; E = 1 - \tau'_\text{D}/\tau_\text{D},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tau_\text{D}'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_\text{D}&lt;/math&gt; are the donor fluorescence lifetimes in the presence and absence of an acceptor respectively, or as
: &lt;math&gt; E = 1 - F_\text{D}'/F_\text{D},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_\text{D}'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_\text{D}&lt;/math&gt; are the donor fluorescence intensities with and without an acceptor respectively.

==Experimental confirmation of the Förster resonance energy transfer theory==
The inverse sixth-power distance dependence of Förster resonance energy transfer was experimentally confirmed by [[Meir Wilchek|Wilchek]], Edelhoch and Brand&lt;ref&gt;ISRAEL ''JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY'' Vol. 1. No. Sa. 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edelhoch | first1 = H. | last2 = Brand | first2 = L. | last3 = Wilchek | first3 = M. | year = 1967 | title = Fluorescence studies with tryptophyl peptides | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 547–559 | doi = 10.1021/bi00854a024 | pmid = 6047638 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using tryptophyl peptides. [[Lubert Stryer|Stryer]], [[Dick Haugland|Haugland]] and Yguerabide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Lakowicz |editor1-first=Joseph R.|title=Principles|date=1991|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York |isbn=978-0-306-43875-2|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; also experimentally demonstrated the theoretical dependence of Förster resonance energy transfer on the overlap integral by using a fused indolosteroid as a donor and a ketone as an acceptor. However, a lot of contradictions of special experiments with the theory was observed. The reason is that the theory has approximate character and gives overestimated distances of 50–100 ångströms.&lt;ref&gt;Vekshin N. L. Energy Transfer in Macromolecules, SPIE, 1997; Vekshin N. L. Photonics of Biopolymers, Springer, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods to measure FRET efficiency==
In fluorescence [[microscopy]], fluorescence [[confocal laser scanning microscopy]], as well as in [[molecular biology]], FRET is a useful tool to quantify molecular dynamics in [[biophysics]] and [[biochemistry]], such as [[protein]]-protein interactions, protein–[[DNA]] interactions, and protein conformational changes. For monitoring the complex formation between two molecules, one of them is labeled with a donor and the other with an acceptor.  The FRET efficiency is measured and used to identify interactions between the labeled complexes. There are several ways of measuring the FRET efficiency by monitoring changes in the fluorescence emitted by the donor or the acceptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Protocol |url=http://coil.bio.ed.ac.uk/Protocols/FRET.htm |publisher=Wellcome Trust |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717083912/http://coil.bio.ed.ac.uk/Protocols/FRET.htm |archivedate=July 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensitized emission===
One method of measuring FRET efficiency is to measure the variation in acceptor emission intensity.&lt;ref name=Clegg2009p1-57/&gt; When the donor and acceptor are in proximity (1–10&amp;nbsp;nm) due to the interaction of the two molecules, the acceptor emission will increase because of the [[intermolecular]] FRET from the donor to the acceptor. For monitoring protein conformational changes, the target protein is labeled with a donor and an acceptor at two loci. When a twist or bend of the protein brings the change in the distance or relative orientation of the donor and acceptor, FRET change is observed. If a molecular interaction or a protein conformational change is dependent on [[ligand]] binding, this FRET technique is applicable to fluorescent indicators for the ligand detection.

===Photobleaching FRET===
FRET efficiencies can also be inferred from the [[photobleaching]] rates of the donor in the presence and absence of an acceptor.&lt;ref name=Clegg2009p1-57/&gt; This method can be performed on most fluorescence microscopes; one simply shines the excitation light (of a frequency that will excite the donor but not the acceptor significantly) on specimens with and without the acceptor fluorophore and monitors the donor fluorescence (typically separated from acceptor fluorescence using a [[bandpass filter]]) over time. The timescale is that of photobleaching, which is seconds to minutes, with fluorescence in each curve being given by

:&lt;math&gt;\text{background} + \text{constant} \cdot e^{-\text{time}/\tau_\text{pb}},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau_\text{pb}&lt;/math&gt; is the photobleaching decay time constant and depends on whether the acceptor is present or not. Since photobleaching consists in the permanent inactivation of excited fluorophores, resonance energy transfer from an excited donor to an acceptor fluorophore prevents the photobleaching of that donor fluorophore, and thus high FRET efficiency leads to a longer photobleaching decay time constant:

:&lt;math&gt; E = 1 - \tau_\text{pb}/\tau_\text{pb}',&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau_\text{pb}'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_\text{pb}&lt;/math&gt; are the photobleaching decay time constants of the donor in the presence and in the absence of the acceptor respectively. (Notice that the fraction is the reciprocal of that used for lifetime measurements).

This technique was introduced by Jovin in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=János |last1=Szöllősi |first2=Denis R. |last2=Alexander |chapter=The Application of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer to the Investigation of Phosphatases |pages=203–24 |editor1-first=Susanne |editor1-last=Klumpp |editor2-first=Josef |editor2-last=Krieglstein |title=Protein Phosphatases |series=Methods in Enzymology, Volume 366 |date=2007 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-12-182269-9 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(03)66017-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use of an entire curve of points to extract the time constants can give it accuracy advantages over the other methods. Also, the fact that time measurements are over seconds rather than nanoseconds makes it easier than fluorescence lifetime measurements, and because photobleaching decay rates do not generally depend on donor concentration (unless acceptor saturation is an issue), the careful control of concentrations needed for intensity measurements is not needed. It is, however, important to keep the illumination the same for the with- and without-acceptor measurements, as photobleaching increases markedly with more intense incident light.

===Lifetime measurements===
FRET efficiency can also be determined from the change in the fluorescence [[Fluorescence#Lifetime|lifetime]] of the donor.&lt;ref name=Clegg2009p1-57/&gt; The lifetime of the donor will decrease in the presence of the acceptor. Lifetime measurements of the FRET-donor are used in [[fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy]] (FLIM).

==Fluorophores used for FRET==
[[File:Proteolytic cleavage of a Dual-GFP fusion FRET-pair.png|thumb|250px|If the linker is intact, excitation at the absorbance wavelength of CFP (414nm) causes emission by YFP (525nm) due to FRET. If the linker is cleaved by a protease, FRET is abolished and emission is at the CFP wavelength (475nm).]]

===CFP-YFP pairs===
One common pair fluorophores for biological use is a [[cyan fluorescent protein]] (CFP) – [[yellow fluorescent protein]] (YFP) pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Periasamy|first=Ammasi|title=Fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy: a mini review|journal=Journal of Biomedical Optics|date=July 2001|volume=6|issue=3|pages=287–291|doi=10.1117/1.1383063|pmid=11516318|bibcode = 2001JBO.....6..287P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are color variants of [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP). Labeling with organic fluorescent dyes requires purification, chemical modification, and intracellular injection of a host protein. GFP variants can be attached to a host protein by [[genetic engineering]] which can be more convenient. Additionally, a fusion of CFP and YFP linked by a [[protease]] cleavage sequence can be used as a cleavage assay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=AW|author2=Daugherty, PS|title=Evolutionary optimization of fluorescent proteins for intracellular FRET.|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=March 2005|volume=23|issue=3|pages=355–60|pmid=15696158|doi=10.1038/nbt1066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BRET===
A limitation of FRET is the requirement for external illumination to initiate the fluorescence transfer, which can lead to background noise in the results from direct excitation of the acceptor or to [[photobleaching]]. To avoid this drawback, [[bioluminescence]] resonance energy transfer (or '''BRET''') has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nicola |last1=Bevan |first2=Stephen |last2=Rees |chapter=Pharmaceutical Applications of GFP and RCFP |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8Y4zrEofpIC&amp;pg=PA361 |pages=361–90 |editor1-first=Martin |editor1-last=Chalfie |editor2-first=Steven R. |editor2-last=Kain |series=Methods of Biochemical Analysis, Volume 47 |title=Green Fluorescent Protein: Properties, Applications and Protocols |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-471-73682-0 |edition=2nd |doi=10.1002/0471739499.ch16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfleger|first=Kevin D G|last2=Eidne|first2=Karin A|title=Illuminating insights into protein-protein interactions using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nmeth841|journal=Nature Methods|volume=3|issue=3|pages=165–174|doi=10.1038/nmeth841|pmid=16489332|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique uses a bioluminescent [[luciferase]] (typically the luciferase from ''[[Renilla reniformis]]'') rather than CFP to produce an initial photon emission compatible with YFP. One drawback of BRET is the requirement to generate at least one fusion protein encoding luciferase, though some applications of FRET can be implemented with antibody-conjugated fluorophores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfleger|first=Kevin D. G.|last2=Eidne|first2=Karin A.|date=2005-02-01|title=Monitoring the formation of dynamic G-protein-coupled receptor–protein complexes in living cells|url=http://www.biochemj.org/content/385/3/625|journal=Biochemical Journal|language=en|volume=385|issue=3|pages=625–637|doi=10.1042/BJ20041361|issn=0264-6021|pmc=1134737|pmid=15504107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BRET has also been implemented using a different luciferase enzyme, engineered from the deep-sea shrimp ''Oplophorus gracilirostris''. This luciferase is smaller (19 kD) and brighter than the more commonly used luciferase from ''Renilla reniformis''.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mo|first=Xiu-Lei|last2=Luo|first2=Yin|last3=Ivanov|first3=Andrei A.|last4=Su|first4=Rina|last5=Havel|first5=Jonathan J.|last6=Li|first6=Zenggang|last7=Khuri|first7=Fadlo R.|last8=Du|first8=Yuhong|last9=Fu|first9=Haian|date=2015-11-16|title=Enabling systematic interrogation of protein-protein interactions in live cells with a versatile ultra-high-throughput biosensor platform|journal=Journal of Molecular Cell Biology|doi=10.1093/jmcb/mjv064|issn=1759-4685|pmid=26578655|pmc=4937889|volume=8|issue=3|pages=271–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robers|first=Matthew B.|last2=Dart|first2=Melanie L.|last3=Woodroofe|first3=Carolyn C.|last4=Zimprich|first4=Chad A.|last5=Kirkland|first5=Thomas A.|last6=Machleidt|first6=Thomas|last7=Kupcho|first7=Kevin R.|last8=Levin|first8=Sergiy|last9=Hartnett|first9=James R.|date=2015-01-01|title=Target engagement and drug residence time can be observed in living cells with BRET|journal=Nature Communications|volume=6|pages=10091|doi=10.1038/ncomms10091|issn=2041-1723|pmc=4686764|pmid=26631872|bibcode=2015NatCo...610091R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoddart|first=Leigh A.|last2=Johnstone|first2=Elizabeth K.

===Homo-FRET===

In general, "FRET" refers to situations where the donor and acceptor proteins (or "fluorophores") are of two different types. In many biological situations, however, researchers might need to examine the interactions between two, or more, proteins of the same type—or indeed the same protein with itself, for example if the protein folds or forms part of a polymer chain of proteins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(01)76265-0 |title=Homo-FRET Microscopy in Living Cells to Measure Monomer-Dimer Transition of GFP-Tagged Proteins |date=2001 |last1=Gautier |first1=I. |last2=Tramier |first2=M. |last3=Durieux |first3=C. |last4=Coppey |first4=J. |last5=Pansu |first5=R.B. |last6=Nicolas |first6=J.-C. |last7=Kemnitz |first7=K. |last8=Coppey-Moisan |first8=M. |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=80 |issue=6 |pages=3000–8 |pmid=11371472 |pmc=1301483|bibcode = 2001BpJ....80.3000G }}&lt;/ref&gt; or for other questions of quantification in biological cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2009.07.059 |title=Homo-FRET Imaging Enables Quantification of Protein Cluster Sizes with Subcellular Resolution |date=2009 |last1=Bader |first1=Arjen N. |last2=Hofman |first2=Erik G. |last3=Voortman |first3=Jarno |last4=Van Bergen En Henegouwen |first4=Paul M.P. |last5=Gerritsen |first5=Hans C. |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=97 |issue=9 |pages=2613–22 |pmid=19883605 |pmc=2770629|bibcode = 2009BpJ....97.2613B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obviously, spectral differences will not be the tool used to detect and measure FRET, as both the acceptor and donor protein emit light with the same wavelengths. Yet researchers can detect differences in the polarisation between the light which excites the fluorophores and the light which is emitted, in a technique called FRET anisotropy imaging; the level of quantified anisotropy (difference in polarisation between the excitation and emission beams) then becomes an indicative guide to how many FRET events have happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/b920242k |title=Fluorescence anisotropy: From single molecules to live cells |date=2010 |last1=Gradinaru |first1=Claudiu C. |last2=Marushchak |first2=Denys O. |last3=Samim |first3=Masood |last4=Krull |first4=Ulrich J. |journal=The Analyst |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=452–9 |pmid=20174695|bibcode = 2010Ana...135..452G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Biology===
FRET has been used to measure distance and detect molecular interactions in a number of systems and has applications in biology and chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakowicz|first=Joseph R.|title=Principles of fluorescence spectroscopy|date=1999|publisher=Kluwer Acad./Plenum Publ.|location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-306-46093-7|pages=374–443|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; FRET can be used to measure distances between domains in a single protein and therefore to provide information about protein conformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0959-440X(00)00249-9 |title=The use of FRET imaging microscopy to detect protein–protein interactions and protein conformational changes in vivo |date=2001 |last1=Truong |first1=Kevin |last2=Ikura |first2=Mitsuhiko |journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=573–8 |pmid=11785758}}&lt;/ref&gt; FRET can also detect interaction between proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0962-8924(98)01434-2 |title=Using GFP in FRET-based applications |date=1999 |last1=Pollok |first1=B |journal=Trends in Cell Biology |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=57–60 |pmid=10087619 |last2=Heim |first2=R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied in vivo, FRET has been used to detect the location and interactions of genes and cellular structures including [[integrins]] and membrane proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1083/jcb.200210140 |title=Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy imaging of live cell protein localizations |date=2003 |last1=Sekar |first1=R.

FRET and BRET are also the common tools in the study of [[Enzyme kinetics|biochemical reaction kinetics]] and [[molecular motors]].

The applications of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) have expanded tremendously in the last 25 years, and the technique has become a staple technique in many biological and biophysical fields. FRET can be used as spectroscopic ruler in various areas such as structural elucidation of biological molecules and their interactions in vitro assays, in vivo monitoring in cellular research, nucleic acid analysis, signal transduction, light harvesting and metallic nanomaterial etc. Based on the mechanism of FRET a variety of novel chemical sensors and biosensors have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frommer|first1=WB|last2=Davidson|first2=MW|last3=Campbell|first3=RE|title=Genetically encoded biosensors based on engineered fluorescent proteins.|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|date=October 2009|volume=38|issue=10|pages=2833–41|doi=10.1039/b907749a|pmid=19771330|pmc=3000468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry===
In the field of chemistry, this technique is growing very fast for monitoring the nanoparticle formation&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez‐Gaytan, Brenda L., et al. "Real‐Time Monitoring of Nanoparticle Formation by FRET Imaging." Angewandte Chemie 129.11 (2017): 2969-2972.&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly to see the protein interaction&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Sarah F., et al. "Quantitative analysis of multi‐protein interactions using FRET: Application to the SUMO pathway." Protein Science 17.4 (2008): 777-784.&lt;/ref&gt; and other many more applications.

==Other methods==
A different, but related, mechanism is [[Dexter electron transfer]].

An alternative method to detecting protein–protein proximity is the [[bimolecular fluorescence complementation]] (BiFC), where two parts of a fluorescent protein are each fused to other proteins. When these two parts meet, they form a fluorophore on a timescale of minutes or hours.&lt;ref name="pmid11983170"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(02)00496-3 |title=Visualization of Interactions among bZIP and Rel Family Proteins in Living Cells Using Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation |date=2002 |last1=Hu |first1=Chang-Deng |last2=Chinenov |first2=Yurii |last3=Kerppola |first3=Tom K. |journal=Molecular Cell |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=789–98 |pmid=11983170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="940">A '''gradient oven tester''' is a testing instrument which simulates the conditions of a [[Industrial oven|production oven]] in the lab.  It is used to test the baking and drying properties of liquid/powder [[coatings]], resins, plastics, etc. and can determine how these materials will react when placed under extreme stress from heat, but more importantly can determine the temperature needed for drying as well as how long it will take for these materials to dry and harden once applied.  The usage of the oven guarantees that these things are known prior to production which aids product consistency.

The gradient oven tester has a heating bank which has 45 heating elements each of which contain a [[Resistance thermometer |Pt-100]] temperature probe.  Each element is individually insulated which allows for the setting of different temperatures in two adjoining elements.

'''Herbert Bernard Callen''' (1919 – May 22, 1993) was an [[United States|American]] physicist best known as the author of the textbook ''[[Thermodynamics]] and an Introduction to Thermostatistics'', the most frequently cited thermodynamic reference in physics research literature.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} During [[World War II]] he was also called upon to undertake theoretical studies of the principles underpinning the effort to create the [[Nuclear weapon|atom bomb]]{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

A native of [[Philadelphia]], Herbert Callen received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from [[Temple University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lowermerionhistory.org/dev/?page_id=266 Callen, Herbert Bernard, Biographies, The Lower Merion Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; He married in 1945, as the war and his work for the [[Manhattan Project]] were coming to an end, and subsequently studied for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in physics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), receiving his degree in 1947. His graduate advisor was the eminent physicist [[László Tisza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Burstein, Elias|author2=Cohen, Michael|author3=Harris, A. Brooks|author4=Lubensky, Tom C.|title=Obituary: Herbert B. Callen|journal=Physics Today|date=August 1994|volume=47|issue=8|pages=74–75|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v47/i8/p74_s1?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.2808620|bibcode=1994PhT....47h..74B|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005024954/http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v47/i8/p74_s1?bypassSSO=1|archivedate=2013-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Callen joined the faculty of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] Department of Physics and, in 1984, received the [[Elliott Cresson Medal]] from the [[Franklin Institute]]. He was also the recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for the academic year 1972/1973,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gf.org/fellows/2167-herbert-b-callen Herbert B. Callen – John Simon Guggenheim Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005033802/http://www.gf.org/fellows/2167-herbert-b-callen |date=2013-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his distinguished career in physics was capped by induction into the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1990. Specialists consider that his most lasting contribution to physics remains the proof of Nyquist's  [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]], an extremely general result describing how a system's response to perturbations relates to its behavior at equilibrium; as well as his classic text on Thermodynamics, which was published in two editions, translated into many languages, and continues to be used at the graduate and undergraduate level in Thermodynamics courses around the world.

After battling [[Alzheimer's disease]] for eleven years, Herbert Callen died in the Philadelphia suburb of [[Merion, Pennsylvania|Merion]] at the age of 73. He and his wife, Sara Smith, had two children, Jed and Jill.

'''Horizon Discovery Group plc (LSE: HZD) ("Horizon")''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.horizondiscovery.com|title=Horizon Discovery Group plc|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a world-leading gene editing company that designs and engineers genetically modified cells and then applies them in research and clinical applications that advance human health.

Horizon builds human disease models and reagents derived from genetically-engineered cells that its customers use, or that are deployed on their behalf to: gain knowledge of the genetic drivers of disease; develop novel drugs or cell therapies targeted at these genetic drivers; and develop companion diagnostics that predict patient response in the clinic.  In this way they apply genetic knowledge to provide biological insights that translate to improved research and development outcomes for drug developers and treatment regimens that better serve patients.

Horizon has an international customer base of over 1,400 unique organisations across more than 50 countries, including major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic companies as well as leading academic research centers. The Group supplies its products and services into a range of markets, estimated to be worth over £29 billion in 2015.

Horizon is headquartered in Cambridge, UK, and is listed on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market under the ticker “HZD”.

==Gene Editing==
'''Gene editing''' is the process by which specific changes are made to the sequence of a gene within the context of a host cell. By editing the code of a patient-derived cell to introduce or repair a genetic change believed to drive disease, a patient’s disease can be reproduced in a laboratory setting, letting researchers ask important biological questions of potential drugs or cell therapies earlier in the drug discovery process.

Tremendous research efforts have gone into identifying and refining the tools used to generate engineered human cell lines. These fall into two categories based on their biological approach:
* '''Gene editing mediated through homologous recombination (e.g. rAAV)''', which takes advantage of a cell’s natural DNA repair mechanism through ‘DNA crossover events ‘to perform precise genome alterations through highly targeted insertions
* '''Gene editing mediated through double strand DNA break repair (e.g. CRISPR, ZFN)''', which generate a cut in DNA, after which a cell’s natural DNA repair mechanisms fix the break, during which errors can occur or modified sequence can be introduced
Each technology has its own features and strengths and it is these differences that make each best suited for addressing different gene-editing challenges.

Horizon has taken a ‘technology agnostic’ approach, developing deep experience and taking multiple licenses for rAAV, CRISPR and ZFNs, letting the company choose the right approach for any project.
* '''Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV)''' can be used in a genome editing platform that uses rAAV vectors to enable insertion, deletion or replacement of DNA sequences in a cell's genes. Horizon has an exclusive global license for research applications for this technology.
* '''Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs)''' are engineered DNA binding proteins that can be designed to bind to a wide variety of DNA sequences and function by introducing a double stranded break at a specified location in the genome. Horizon has licensed this technology from Sigma-Aldrich for use in custom ''in vitro'' and exclusively for ''in vivo'' gene-editing projects.
* '''CRISPR/Cas9''' is an RNA-guided gene-editing platform derived from ''Streptococcus pyogenes'' that makes use of an endonuclease (Cas9) and a synthetic guide RNA to introduce a double strand break at a specific location within the genome. Horizon has licensed IP from Harvard University, the Broad Institute and ERS Genomics with the goal of being able to ensure uninterrupted use of this technology to customers.
Through its gene editing platform, Horizon is able to alter genes in virtually any human or mammalian cell line. Based on this, Horizon now offers over 23,000 cell line pairs that accurately model the mutations found in genetically based diseases.

These ‘patients-in-a-test-tube’ are being used directly by customers, or by Horizon on their behalf, to identify the effect of individual or compound genetic mutations on drug activity, patient responsiveness, and resistance, which may lead to the successful prediction of which patient sub-groups will respond to currently available and future drug treatments.

Once built, engineered cells can also act as product manufacturing engines, yielding related cell and reagent products that can be used by customers as research tools or molecular diagnostic reference standards or as a means to generate advanced ''in vivo'' models, or even as factories for the manufacturing of protein-based therapeutics.

In this way, the cells power Horizon’s entire business of Products, Services and high value Research Biotech initiatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3023">A '''kitchenette''' is a small cooking area, which usually has a fridge and a microwave, but may have other appliances. In some [[motel]] and [[hotel]] rooms, [[studio apartment|small apartments]], college [[Dormitory|dormitories]], or office buildings, a kitchenette usually consists of a small [[refrigerator]], a [[microwave oven]] or [[hotplate]], and, less frequently, a [[sink]]. [[New York City]] [[building code]] defines a kitchenette as a [[kitchen]] of less than 7.4 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (80&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of [[floor]] space.&lt;ref name=NYCCode&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/downloads/pdf/cc_chapter12.pdf |author=Department of Buildings |title=Interior Environment |date= |publisher=New York City |accessdate=2007-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524063125/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/downloads/pdf/cc_chapter12.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cuisinette studio in Sherbrooke April 2010.jpg|thumb|Example of kitchenette located in a small studio apartment of [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]], [[Canada]].]]
==In hotels and motels==
Kitchenettes are a common feature in hotel and motel guest rooms and often contain a [[coffeemaker]], a bar refrigerator, commonly called a [[mini-bar]]. Some hotel kitchenettes have provisioned refrigerators that have an interior sensor feature used by management to monitor guest use of the refrigerator's contents and thus charge for the consumables, which typically include soda, beer, and liquor.

==In Britain==
In British English, the term kitchenette also refers to a small secondary kitchen in a house. Often it is found on the same floor as the children's bedrooms, and used by a [[nanny]] or [[au pair]] to prepare meals for children; the same feature can be found in hotels such as some in [[London]].
==Small apartment style==
The word ''kitchenette'' was also used to refer to a type of small apartment prevalent in African American communities in [[Chicago]] and New York City during the mid-twentieth century. Landlords often divided single-family homes or large apartment units into smaller units to house more families. Living conditions in these kitchenettes were often wretched; the author [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] described them as "our prison, our death sentence without a trial".&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Washington Ward and Robert Butler. "Kitchenettes". ''The Richard Wright Encyclopedia''. ABC-CLIO, 2008. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], a kitchenette (spelled "quitinete" {{IPA-pt|kitʃiˈnɛtʃi|}} in Brazilian Portuguese) is a very small apartment. It is composed of one room, one bathroom, and a kitchen, which is often in the same space as the room. It corresponds to the [[studio apartment]] in American culture (or a [[bedsit]] in the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]]).

'''Kongsberg Spacetec AS''' or '''KSPT''', prior to 1994 '''Spacetec A/S''', is a supplier of [[ground stations]] based in [[Tromsø]], [[Norway]]. It is owned by the [[Kongsberg Group]] and is part of its [[Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace]] division. The company is co-located with [[Kongsberg Satellite Services]] (KSAT) and [[Tromsø Satellite Station]] (TSS).

==History==
The company was established by some of the most experienced employees of Tromsø Satellite Station,&lt;ref name=jaklin&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacetec |last=Jaklin |first=Asbjørn |work=[[Nordlys]] |date=27 May 1992 |page=12 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been operating since 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Tjelmeland: 374&lt;/ref&gt; They originally established Drive Electronics in 1982, but it was bankrupt two years later. The company was re-established as Spacetec,&lt;ref name=jaklin /&gt; which was registered on 11 December 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proff.no/selskap/kongsberg-spacetec-as/troms%C3%B8/dataprogramvare-og-utvikling/Z0I5SK3Z/ |title=Kongsberg Spacetec AS |publisher=Proff |language=Norwegian |accessdate=28 October 2012 |archivedate=10 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66occPZHU?url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/hsr/HSR_35.pdf |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was established with a share capital of NOK&amp;nbsp;5 million or NOK&amp;nbsp;1,000 per share.&lt;ref name=johannessen&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacetec A/S overta |last=Johannessen |first=Bjørn E. |work=[[Nordlys]] |date=10 March 1994 |page=18 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Norsk Data]], Computas, Informasjonskontroll and Noratom, Spacetec established the joint venture Norspace to act as supplier to the [[European Space Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Norsk romfart |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=14 September 1985 |page=10 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1986, the company had eighteen employees. It received a state subsidy of NOK&amp;nbsp;6.25 million to finance its expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacetec i Tromsø får millionstøtte |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=7 April 1986 |page=10 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This resulted in a contract to deliver a ground station system to [[Esrange]] in [[Kiruna]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rombyen Tromsø |last=Jaklin |first=Asbjørn |work=[[Nordlys]] |date=10 September 1988 |page=36 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]] developed an application of [[synthetic-aperture radar]] for satellites at this was to be commercialized by Spacetec and Norsk Data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Norge inn i romalderen |last=Olsen |first=Claude R. |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=27 August 1988 |page=22 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1988 the company signed a contract to deliver equipment worth NOK&amp;nbsp;26 million to TSS in partnership with Norsk Data. This involved Spacetec designing a downlink and image processing software for [[ERS-1]] which needed to be capable of handling 100 [[megabits per second]]. The new ground station was to be completed in 1989 and operational by April 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Millionkontrakter |last=Vik |first=Kjetil |work=[[Nordlys]] |date=16 July 1988 |page=5 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1988, Norspace signed an agreement to deliver telemetry components for ESA's [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] module for the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Norspace sikrer romkontrakter |last=Olsen |first=Claude R. |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=12 January 1989 |page=2 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December Spacetec signed an agreement with ESA to develop a system to transfer satellite data from magnetic tapes to optical discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ingen sfæriske |last=Vik |first=Kjetil |work=[[Nordlys]] |date=22 December 1989 |page=3 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1989, Spacetec participated in a cooperation with TSS and the University of Tromsø in developing technology to send satellite images to customers in the course of minutes, rather than hours and days, through the use of broadband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Satellittbilder på rekordtid |last=Larsen |first=Rolf L. |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=29 December 1989 |page=22 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ten years of development, the [[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]] launched its CESAR [[supercomputer]], which was tailor-made for analysis of SAR images and had been developed in cooperation with Spacetec. It allowed for the analysis of a {{convert|100|by|100|km2|sp=us}} surface area in eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ND og FFI med superdatamaskin |last=Olsen |first=Claude R. |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=8 August 1990 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1990, Spacetec signed an agreement with ESA to develop and supply a simulator to test and verify the launching ramp of the [[Ariane 5]] rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ariane-kontrakt til Spacetec |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=2 November 1990 |page=2 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacetec cooperated with the [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]] to develop a processing system for the latter to utilize satellite data for meteorology. With two years of development, Spacetec planned to sell the technology to other users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Overvåker været fra rommet |last=Heimark |first=Kjell Gunnar |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=20 November 1990 |page=16 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 Spacetec signed an agreement with ESA to deliver telemetry systems to ERS-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacetec |last=Mogård |first=Lars Egil |work=[[Nordlys]] |date=16 October 1993 |page=7|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the company had 38 employees, of which 30 were engineers. It had a revenue of NOK&amp;nbsp;28 million and a net income of NOK&amp;nbsp;2.9 million. One sixth of the company was owned by various employees, while the remaining was owned by various industrial companies in Tromsø.&lt;ref name=jaklin /&gt; The largest were Odd Berg Gruppen (29 percent) and [[Sparebanken Nord-Norge]] (18 percent). Norsk Forsvarsteknologi (NFT) made an unsuccessful attempt to purchase Spacetec in December 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NFT trekker tilbud  |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=24 December 1993 |page=15 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a price of NOK&amp;nbsp;1300 per share. Negotiations with the main shareholders followed and by March NFT had bought the company at a price of NOK&amp;nbsp;1,550 per share, NOK&amp;nbsp;7.75 million in total.&lt;ref name=johannessen /&gt;

In August 1994, Spacetect signed a contract for parts of a new ground station in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacetec kontrakt |work=[[Nordlys]] |date=10 August 1994 |page=8 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1995, Spacetec started a cooperation with the French company [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] to develop systems for the [[European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NTF-selskap samarbeider med fransk selskap |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=29 September 1995 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, a subsidiary was established which would work with processing medical [[X-ray]] images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacetec med røntgen |work=[[Nordlys]] |last=Johanessen |first=Bjørn E. |date=22 November 1995 |page=8 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacetec participated with technology for the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Solens hemmeligheter skal avsløres |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Larsen |first=Rolf L. |date=24 November 1995 |page=11 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Norwegian Space Center]] started negotiations with [[NASA]] to provide a ground station for the [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS) in [[Longyearbyen]].&lt;ref&gt;Wormdal (2011): 38&lt;/ref&gt; [[Svalbard Satellite Station]] was established in 1997 and was owned by Kongsberg/Lockheed Martin Space Data Services, a joint venture between Kongsberg Spacetec and [[Lockheed Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nytt selskap for satellittdata |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=14 November 1997 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year Kongsberg Spacetec had a revenue of NOK&amp;nbsp;42 million and they announced that they would focus on receiving contracts in Asia and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacetec ser mot Østen og Svalbard |work=[[Nordlys]] |last=Mogård |first=Lars Egil |date=22 November 1997 |page=29 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1990s, Kongsberg Spacetec had a fairly stable revenue and an annual profit of between NOK&amp;nbsp;2 and 3 million. In 1997, Kongsberg moved ten employees working on a radar system to Tromsø and co-located them with Spacetec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacetec – et bedriftseventyr |work=[[Nordlys]] |last=Mathisen |first=Mona C. |date=26 February 1998 |page=10 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacetec experienced a major revenue increase from 1999 to 2002, to more than NOK&amp;nbsp;60 million. However, they were not able to increase their profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stor omsetningsøkning for Spacetec |work=[[Nordlys]] |last=Ballari |first=Aslak |date=16 July 2002 |page=12 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years development of new weather satellite technology, Spacetec won a contract worth NOK&amp;nbsp;50 million in September 2002 for [[Meteosat 8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kongsberg Spacetec fikk kontrakt  |work=[[Nordlys]] |last=Endresen |first=Rune |date=10 September 2002 |page=16 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, ownership and operations of the facility were consolidated and taken over by the newly created Kongsberg Satellite Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lokalstyre.no/getfile.aspx/document/epcx_id/597/epdd_id/731 |title=Delplan for Svalbard Satellittstasjon (SvalSat), Platåberget |publisher=[[Kongsberg Satellite Services]] |date=12 October 2005 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 April 2012 |archivedate=12 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66rpxoyE1?url=http://www.lokalstyre.no/getfile.aspx/document/epcx_id/597/epdd_id/731 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lockheed Martin was no longer interested in owning a share of the facility, and sold their shares. NSC and Kongsberg merged their interests in the new company, which also took over Tromsø Satellite Station.&lt;ref&gt;Wormdal (2011): 44&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, six antennas, between {{convert|9|and|13|m|sp=us}} in diameter, had been installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiaa.org/Spaceops2004Archive/downloads/papers/SPACE2004sp-template00188F.pdf |title=Interoperability reduces cost and risk at Svalbard Satellite Station |last=Skatteboe |first=R. |last2=Kjeldsen |first2=A.

The company cited a combination of reduced activity in ESA, a delay in the Meteosat program and a reduction in discounted wage taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacetec-kutt i Tromsø  |work=[[Nordlys]] |last=Endresen |first=Rune |date=12 April 2005 |page=5 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine people were laid off. Following this, there surfaced that there periodically had been poor cooperation between Spacetec and KSAT, as the latter had been in a period with rapid growth without the other following suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tidligere Spacetek-ansatte kritiserer ledere |work=[[Nordlys]] |last=Endresen |first=Rune |date=30 May 2005 |page=14 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacetec had its break-through with [[NASA]] in September 2006 when it signed an agreement to deliver twenty-two ground stations to [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in a contract worth NOK&amp;nbsp;19 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Skjøt blink hos Nasa |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |last=Heggelund |first=Trond |date=7 September 2006|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spacetec signed its first contract with a Russian organization in April 2007, when a contract for a ground station for Meteosat was signed with [[Hydrometeorological Centre of Russia]] with options for a further two stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mer solskinn for Spacetec |work=[[Bladet Tromsø]] |date=27 April 2007 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tromsø Centre for Remote Technology was established in February 2008 as a cooperation between Spacetec, KSAT, UiT and the [[Northern Research Institute]]. The goal of the project was to create closer ties between research and commercial activity within satellite communication technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Verden sett fra Tromsø |work=[[Bladet Tromsø]] |date=22 February 2008 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''Learn.com''' was a software company headquartered in [[Sunrise, Florida]]. Learn.com provided on-demand [[learning management]] and [[talent management]] software, and [[e-learning]] courses.

==History==
Learn.com was founded by Jim Riley and Patrick Toomey in January 1999 as a website that allowed anyone to create and publish [[e-learning]] courses or e-learning sites (called LearnCenters). Learn.com became an early example of a website containing [[open content]].

In September 2000, Learn.com introduced the first commercial version of its LearnCenter LMS, with assistance of co-founder JW Ray.

In June 2001, Learn.com client [[ECOT]] became the first electronic charter school in the nation to graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;Lager, B: "The Kids that ECOT Taught", page 250. EOS, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2002, Learn.com acquired Learn2 Corporation, a provider of e-learning content.

In June 2004, Learn.com acquired Mentor Communications, Inc.

In December 2005, Learn.com introduced LearnCenter X, the [[Human capital management|HCM]] industry's first integrated [[Talent management]] suite.

In September 2007, Learn.com introduced its WebRoom [[web conferencing]] product.

In June 2009, Learn.com introduced its Learn.com Personal Edition (LPE), a website that allows anyone to take courses and learn/improve skills or create and publish their own courses.

In October 2010, Learn.com was acquired by [[Taleo Corporation]] (NASDAQ: TLEO), a leader in the on-demand Talent Management market.  In April 2012, Taleo was in turn acquired by Oracle Corporation and Learn.com technology became the foundation for the Oracle Learn Cloud product.

==Awards==
In November 2009,&lt;ref&gt;Elearning! Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; announced that Learn.com was the first winner in their newly created Best Talent Management System (TMS) category. Learn.com also won top honors for its Learning Management System (LMS) in this readers' choice award and continued the trend of Best Enterprise LMS recognition for a record fourth year in a row as the company had won top honors in 2006 from Training Magazine.

In January 2008, Elearning! Magazine announced that their readers had voted the Learn.com LearnCenter platform as the Best LMS for 2007.&lt;ref name="2elearning.com"&gt;Elearning! Magazine: "Best of Elearning!

Magazine voters also gave top honors to Learn.com's Information Technology (IT) and Soft Skills content libraries.&lt;ref name="2elearning.com"/&gt; Learn.com LearnCenter was voted one of the Best Enterprise LMS for 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Elearning!

| Agilent A2051&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Razer used a lens with a magnification factor greater than that recommended by Agilent to obtain an effective 1000 DPI resolution from the 800 DPI A2051 sensor, giving a lower maximum tracking speed. As a result, users who preferred a lower sensitivity setting (requiring greater/faster physical movement of the mouse) found the Viper unusable.&lt;/ref&gt;

| Optical
| Agilent A3070/A3080&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Depending on date of manufacture. The A3070 sensor suffered from an issue known as pixel jitter compensation; one units worth (a single pixel in the context of a GUI desktop with a 1:1 mouse input/output ratio) of accurate movement was lost immediately after reversing the physical direction of travel of the Diamondback, resulting in the 'skipping' of the mouse pointer. This issue only occurred at high sensitivity settings, and could be largely negated with the use of a software fix (programmed by a helpful Razer user going by the name of "Atalan"), made available as a patch and in Razers drivers. Later runs of the Diamondback used the A3080 sensor which did not suffer from this issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an alphabetic list of achievements in [[science]] and [[technology]] made by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] during the 15,000 years that they have inhabited the [[Americas]].

{{Compact ToC|seealso=yes|nobreak=yes|side=yes|notes=yes|refs=yes|center=yes}}

==A==

[[File:Pulseras Nepohualtzintzin.jpg|thumb|An illustration of the Pre-Columbian abacus: the [[Nepohualtzintzin]]]]
* [[Abacus]] – the Aztec and Maya of Mesoamerica performed arithmetic operations using an abacus. It served as a more accurate and faster alternative to a written out solution or relying on memory alone. This Mesoamerican abacus, the [[Nepohualtzintzin]], has been dated by archaeologists to have had a presence in Mesoamerica from about A.D. 900-1,000, and possibly sooner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuevoleon.inea.gob.mx/MEVyT/Disco1/cursos/numyc/interface/main/recursos/revista/revista5.htm|title=The Prehispanic Computer? The Nepohualtzintzin|date=September 1986|work=Chispa Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Abstract art]] – abstract art was used by nearly all tribes and civilizations of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]. [[Tribal art|Indigenous art]] was believed to be primitive until the 1890s when it served as inspiration for the modern American abstract art movement. See also [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas]].

[[File:Cueva de las Jarillas.jpg|thumb|Adobe buildings at [[Cuarenta Casas]]]]
* [[Adobe]] – adobe was used by the peoples from South America, [[Mesoamerica]], and up to [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] tribes of the U.S. It is estimated that it was developed around the year 3000 BCE.
* [[Agave wine]] – is made from the same plant, [[Agave tequilana|blue agave]], as [[tequila]] but with a lower [[Alcohol by volume|alcohol content]].
* [[Almanacs]] – almanacs were invented independently by the [[Maya peoples]]. Their culture arose and they began using them around 3,500 years ago, while Europeans are known to have created written almanacs only after 1150 CE. Almanacs are books containing meteorological and astronomical information, which the Maya used in various aspects of their life.
* [[Alpaca]]s – the [[Andean civilizations]] were amongst the first to domesticate alpacas.
* [[American football]] – the [[Iroquois]] claim to have played football. While no specification is made as to whether this is meant to be American football or soccer. Soccer is said to have been invented in Asia.&lt;ref name="Froman, Frances 2014"&gt;Froman, Frances &amp; Keye, Alfred J. "English-Cayuga/Cayuga-English Dictionary" 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anesthetics]] – Indigenous peoples used [[coca]], [[peyote]], [[datura]] and other plants for partial or total loss of sensation or conscious during surgery. Western doctors had effective anesthetics only after the mid-19th century. Before this, they either had to perform surgery while the patient felt pain or knock the patient out.
* [[Apartment|Apartment blocks]] – the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] (Anasazi) and other tribes which once thrived in the present day Southwest of the US, developed complex multistory apartment complexes, some of which are still in use today. [[Pueblo]] communities in present-day [[New Mexico]] continue to reside in some of these ancient multistory apartment complexes which were constructed by their ancestors many centuries ago, even before the first apartments were built in the United States during the 18th century. [[Pueblo Bonito]], one of the seminal archaeological sites today is a example of this indigenous multistory apartment complex construction technology from the Anasazi and [[Hohokam]] time periods about a thousand years ago.
[[File:Nazca monkey.jpg|thumb|[[Nazca]] monkey]]
*Art to be viewed from space – the [[Nazca Lines]] were created by the ancient [[Nazca culture]] in modern-day [[Peru]]. The Nazca built these artworks, which could only be viewed from the sky or from space. It was as if the Nazca were building monuments, which only their gods could view from up in the sky. Some of these artworks, otherwise known as the Nazca Lines, could only be viewed from the sky and each one of these works of Nazca art spans several miles across in size and dimension in the [[Sechura Desert]].
* [[Aqueduct (water supply)|Aqueducts]] – the ancient Andean cultures such as [[Chimú culture|Chimu]] and the [[Moche culture|Moche]] lived in very dry environments. Yet, despite the dryness of the areas where they resided, they were able to thrive, build great cities, towns, and civilizations. This was largely due to farming in these dry regions, which these peoples engaged in and farming is largely dependent upon the availability of fresh water. Using extensive aqueducts, they were able to transport water from the rivers, mountain streams, and lakes to their fields and build the food base required for building great civilizations. The [[History of the Incas|Inca]] later expanded on these already constructed aqueducts and built even more complex and large aqueduct system in the [[Inca Empire]]. The Mesoamerican [[Aztecs]] also constructed complex aqueducts to bring water to their vast city of [[Tenochtitlan]].
* [[Aspirin]] – indigenous Americans have been using [[willow]] tree bark for thousands of years to reduce fever and pain as were the peoples of [[Assyria]], [[Sumer]], [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. When chemists analyzed willows in the last century, they discovered [[salicylic acid]], the basis of the modern drug aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starryskies.com/articles/dln/1-01/asprin.html|title=The Science of Asprin and Willows|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Spear-thrower|Atlatl]] – [[Paleo-Indians]] ([[Beringia]]n Diaspora) from over 11,500 years ago had developed a highly developed spear thrower in the form of the atlatl to hunt [[woolly mammoth]]s, [[Ground sloth|giant sloths]], [[mastodon]], [[muskox]] ([[euceratherium]]), [[Castoroides|giant beaver]], early [[Reindeer|caribou]], [[steppe bison]], [[saber-toothed cat]], and other [[Pleistocene]] animals. Using the atlatl, these ancient [[Paleo-Indians]] were able to traverse much of the Americas from [[Alaska]] down to [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]] and into South America, all the way down to [[Chile]] as they hunted and followed these Pleistocene [[megafauna]] within a short 3,000 year time period from about 14,500 years ago to about 11,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paleo-Indians]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Avocado]] – indigenous Americans were the first to domesticate and grow avocado.&lt;ref name="nrcs.usda.gov"&gt;https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs141p2_024206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== B ==

[[File:Mesoamerica - manopla and ball.jpg|thumb|Solid rubber ball]]
* [[Ball]]s, rubber – the [[Olmecs]] produced rubber balls around 1700 BCE. They were the first people to develop and [[Mesoamerican ballgame|play with rubber balls]] as well as manufacture other objects of rubber.
* [[Bean]]s – most commonly eaten beans today, were originally cultivated in the Americas by indigenous Americans. Beans ([[Phaseolus]]) along with [[Cucurbita|squash]] and [[maize]] formed the "Three Sister (crops)" which were grown by many [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] American cultures, tribes, nations, and civilizations.
* [[Calabash|Bottle gourd]]s – the [[Pre-Columbian Mexico|ancient Mexicans]] learned to first cultivate the bottle gourds around 8,000 BCE. Indigenous peoples raised bottle gourds for use as bowls, scoops, colanders, ladles, spoons, canteens, and dippers. Larger gourds were used as cooking vessels. The [[indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands]] hung bottle gourds on poles in their cornfields to serve as habitats for insect-eating birds (a form of biological pest control, which they developed). Indigenous Americans in northern Peru also used bottle gourds as floats for fishing nets.
* [[Bulletproof vest]] – while [[Kevlar]] and modern additions were invented by Europeans, the original bulletproof vest was accidentally invented by the Aztecs. It was made with a framework of cloth soaked in salt water, paper-mached into a thick vest and sun-dried. While intended to stop spears thrown by atlatl, the Spanish soon discovered that they also stopped musket shot. After defeating the Aztecs, most Europeans borrowed the idea, making metal armor a thing of the past. The only supposed downside was that they were itchy, hot, and uncomfortable to wear.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2015"&gt;Phillips, Charles "The Complete Illustrated History of the Aztec &amp; Maya: The Definitive Chronicle of the Ancient Peoples of Central America &amp; Mexico - Including the Aztec, Maya, Olmec, Mixtec, Toltec &amp; Zapotec" 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bunk bed]] – the Iroquoian [[Longhouses of the indigenous peoples of North America|longhouses]] housed several families together. The concept of bunk beds was developed by these [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples, since these longhouses included several bed combinations which featured one bed built on top of another akin to bunk beds in the modern era.

== C ==
[[File:Aztec calendar.svg|thumb|The [[Aztec Calendar Stone]]]]
* [[Calendar]]s – were developed by indigenous Americans throughout North America, Mesoamerica, and South America. They are known to have been in used since 600 BCE. Some calendars were so precise that by the 5th century BCE they were only 19 minutes off.
* [[Canal]]s –the Aztecs built great canals used for transporting food, cargo, and relaying people to the chinampas (floating gardens used for growing food) in their great metropolis of Tenochtitlan.
* [[Canoe]] – many indigenous nations including the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], [[Cree]], Iroquois, and others had developed many distinct forms, styles, and types of canoes over the millennia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Canoe]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cassava]] – the first cultivation of cassava.
* [[Causeway]] – the Aztecs built many giant causeways that connected the mainland to their capital city of Tenochtitlan located in the heart of the [[Aztec Empire]]. The causeways served as arteries used for transporting food, goods, people, prisoners, and wastes during the heyday of the Aztec Empire during the 14th century to the 16th century.
* [[Chaps]] – these appear to have been first used as a sort of leather armor to protect the legs from injury during guerrilla attacks by east coast native peoples. Some of these peoples ended up migrating to [[Texas]] shortly before the [[Texas Revolution]], where it appears that others discovered that wearing chaps over pants reduced chaffing on long horseback rides and it came to be adopted by US, Mexican and indigenous horse-riding cultures.
* [[Chewing gum]] – Native Americans in [[New England]] introduced the settlers to chewing gum made from the [[spruce]] tree. The [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], on the other hand, were the first people to use [[latex]] gum; better known to them as ''[[chicle]]''.

[[File:Chinampa.JPG|thumb|One of the few remaining chinampas at [[Xochimilco]]]]
* [[Chinampa]] – floating gardens which were highly productive areas used for farming and growing food, were constructed by the Aztecs to provide food and sustenance to their 250,000 inhabited city of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs used the chinampas in and around Tenochtitlan to grow corn, squash, beans, tomato, avocado, chill, peppers, and all others sorts of food products to feed the burgeoning population of their great metropolis.
* [[Chocolate]] – the [[Maya civilization]] were the first to drink cocoa. This tradition was later passed on to the Aztecs who called the beverage ''[[Aztec cuisine#Cacao|xocalatl]]''. Indigenous people in Mesoamerica introduced it to the Spanish and Portuguese, but they kept the beloved ''xocalatl'' from the rest of Europe for nearly a century.
* [[Chunkey]] – a Native American game where a person rolls a hoop covered in a leather strap framework and tries to hit it with spears or arrows. This may have inspired the sport of [[skeet shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;"Chumash Indians-Sports and Recreation". Retrieved 2008-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Maize|Corn (maize)]] – the domestication of maize, now cultivated throughout the world, is one of the most influential technological contributions of Mesoamericans.
* [[Compulsory education]] – the Aztec Triple Alliance, which ruled from 1428 to 1521, is considered to be the first state to implement a system of universal compulsory education.&lt;ref name="Soustelle2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Soustelle|title=Daily life of the Aztecs: on the eve of the Spanish Conquest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMrNE7uq-tMC|accessdate=27 November 2012|date=11 November 2002|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-42485-9|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia: [[Aztec#Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Corn beer]] – made in the Andes it is of [[Periodization of pre-Columbian Peru|pre-Incan]] origin from the [[Wari culture]].
* [[Cornmeal]] –
* [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] – Native Americans were the first to domesticate and grow cranberries.&lt;ref name="nrcs.usda.gov"/&gt;

== D ==

[[File:Dique Nezahualcóyotl primer mapa de Tenochtitlan.png|thumb|Detail of Nezahualcóyotl's dam to control water levels around [[Tenochtitlan]]]]

* [[Dam]]s – the Aztecs in Tenochtitlan constructed great dams during the heyday of the Aztec Empire. Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec empire, was first built on a small island that was located in the western section of [[Lake Texcoco]] in 1325 CE. The Aztecs created a large artificial island around the small island using a system that was similar to building the chinampas (floating gardens in the lake that was used to grow food for the cities' population). To provide drinking water to the cities' population of over a quarter of a million inhabitants, the Aztecs built a system of dams that separated the salty waters of the lake from the rainwater that was accumulated during periods of heavy rains. The Aztecs also used the dam to control the level of water in the lake and prevent their city from being flooded during times of heavy rains. To prevent flooding, the Aztecs constructed an inner system of channels that helped to control the water level and held the level steady during flooding and periods of intense rains. [[Hernán Cortés]]and the other Spanish [[conquistador]]s destroyed these engineering marvels that the Aztecs had developed during the previous 200 years.
* [[Dog breed]]s – [[Native American dogs]] believed to have been bred by indigenous Americans are the ''xochiocoyotl'' ([[coyote]]), ''xoloitzcuintli'' (known as xolo or [[Mexican Hairless Dog|Mexican hairless]]), [[Chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]], [[Peruvian Hairless Dog]], the [[Carolina Dog]], [[Canadian Eskimo Dog]], and the [[Alaskan Malamute]].

== E ==

[[File:Momias de Llullaillaco en la Provincia de Salta (Argentina).jpg|thumb|[[Children of Llullaillaco]] found at [[Llullaillaco]] in [[Salta Province]] (Argentina)]]

* [[Electroplating]] – the [[Moche culture|Moche]] independently developed electroplating technology without any [[Old World]] influences. The Moche used electricity derived from chemicals to [[Gilding|gild]] copper with a thin outer layer of gold. In order to start the electroplating process, the Moche first concocted a very corrosive and a highly acidic liquid solution in which they dissolved small traces of gold. The technique also involved copper, which was then inserted into the resulting acidic solution. The copper then acted both as a [[cathode]] and an [[anode]], and this generated the necessary electric current needed to start the electroplating process. The gold ions in the solution were attracted to the copper anode and cathode and formed a thin layer over the copper, giving the latter the appearance of a solid gold object, even though gold only coated the outermost layer of the copper object. The Moche then allowed the acidic solution to boil slowly, causing a very thin layer/coating of gold to permanently coat the copper anode and cathode. This advanced electroplating technique was developed during 500 CE by the Moche, a thousand years before Europeans invented the same process.

* [[Embalming]] – Egyptians are known for [[Mummy|mummificatio]]n, which began around 6000 BCE to 600 CE. In what is now Chile, however, the [[Chinchorro culture|Chinchorro peoples]] are known to have been [[Chinchorro mummies|embalming and mummifying]] their dead since around 5000 BCE. Embalming is using preservatives to prevent decay of the body. Many other indigenous American peoples further perfected the art of embalming and mummification including the skilled Moche peoples in present-day Peru.
* [[Ephedra]] – the Aztecs used ephedra in order to treat common colds. Unlike the Chinese version of the ephedra, the [[New World]] ephedra that was used by the indigenous Americans contained milder [[alkaloid]]s.

== F ==

[[File:Chuño.jpg|thumb|[[Chuño]], a freeze dried potato]] 
* [[Freeze-drying]] – the [[Andean civilizations]] learned to freeze dry potatoes ([[chuño]]) and other food items, so that the resultant dehydrated powder could be stored for years and then later transported across vast distances to feed countless hungry peoples. The Spanish conquistadors used this Andean invented freeze-drying technique to transport several tonnes of dehydrated potatoes across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] back to Europe to feed hungry Europeans.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/09/0914_040913_information_about_indians.html|title=16 Indian Innovations: From Popcorn to Parkas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== G ==
* [[Gold plating]] – the Moche dissolved gold using an [[alum]]/[[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]]/[[salt]] mixture which was then deposited onto copper vessels.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lechtman, "A Pre-Columbian Technique for Electrochemical Plating of Gold and Silver on Copper Objects," Journal of Metals 31 (1979): 154–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New perspectives on Moche Metallurgy: Techniques of Gilding Copper at Loma Negra, Northern Peru , Heather Lechtman, Antonieta Erlij, and Edward J. Barry [https://www.jstor.org/pss/280051 online abstract via ''www.jstor.org'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Green bean]] – this, as well as other varieties, were first farmed in South America and migrated to North America where it was adopted by Europeans.
* [[Guinea pig]]s – indigenous South Americans had domesticated the guinea pig as a food source around 9,000 to 6,000 BCE. The Inca people took guinea pig farming to new heights.
[[File:Two adult Guinea Pigs (Cavia porcellus).jpg|thumb|Two guinea pigs]]

==H==
* [[Hammock]]s – hammocks were commonly used in the [[Caribbean]], South and Central America at first contact with Europeans. The Spanish liked the comfortable way of sleeping and adopted them. Europeans eventually used them as the primary way of sleeping on ships.
* [[Harpoon]]s – the [[Inuit]] had developed the harpoon independent of any Old World influences, in order to hunt seals, walrus, and whales. The Inuit of West Greenland called the harpoon, maupok. Harpoons enabled the Inuit to hunt large [[marine mammal]]s from a distance in the [[umiak]] and [[kayak]] in the open [[Arctic Ocean]].
* [[Hominy]] – this is a specialized corn dish known by many North American native people. Today, it is most commonly seen in the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name="Chafe, Wallace L 2007"&gt;Chafe, Wallace L. "Handbook of the Seneca Language (North American Indian Languages Edition)" 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hockey]] – Both [[field hockey]] and [[ice hockey]] are based on a game called [[shinny]]. This indigenous [[stickball]] game was played throughout North America well before the European arrival.
* [[Horse breed]]s – [[Appaloosa]] and [[Pinto horse|Pinto]].

== I ==

[[File:Igloo inner.jpg|thumb|Inside an igloo]]
* [[Igloo]]s – built by the Inuit, igloos were constructed for many centuries as a form of protection and shelter to house people from the harsh [[Arctic]] weather. While the temperature outside an igloo may have been {{convert|-45|C}}, the temperature within an igloo was stable ranging from {{convert|-7|to|16|C}} when warmed by body heat. The Central Inuit people in [[Northern Canada]] (especially those, who lived around the [[Davis Strait]]), lined the inside living area of an igloo with animal skin and hides. This assisted in increasing the temperature within an igloo from around {{convert|2|C}} to {{convert|10|–|20|C}}, thereby insuring a more comfortable existence for the inhabitants of the igloo from the fierce cold outside. With the addition of a [[kudlik]] the temperature could be raised even more.
* [[Inca road system]]s – the Inca built one of the most extensive road systems in the ancient world. The Incas built upon the roads, which were originally constructed by previous Andean civilizations such as the [[Chimú culture|Chimu]], [[Nazca culture|Nazca]], [[Wari culture|Wari]], [[Moche culture|Moche]], and others. The Inca also further refined and expanded upon the earlier innovations and systems laid in place by previous Indigenous cultures. The Incan road system, at its peak, spanned over {{convert|20,000|mi|abbr=on}} and criss crossed mountains, rivers, deserts, rainforests, and plains. The road system connected the empire from the Andes mountain in [[Colombia]] all through [[Ecuador]], Peru, [[Bolivia]], northeastern [[Argentina]], and present-day northern Chile. The Inca roads were used to transport food, goods, people, and armies, while Inca officials frequently relayed messages using the roads across the vast stretches of the Inca Empire. In areas, where rivers blocked the directions of the roads, the Inca constructed elaborate and complex [[Inca rope bridge|rope bridges]].
* Inuit [[snow goggles]] – the Inuit made snow goggles which protected their eyes against the harsh winds in the Arctic regions of North America, long before sunglasses became available to modern Europeans.
[[File:Inuit Snow goggles from Alaska. Made from carved wood, 1880-1890CE (top) and Caribou antler 1000-1800 CE (bottom).jpg|thumb|Snow goggles]]
== J ==
* [[Jerky]] – indigenous Americans were the first to develop jerky from smoked buffalo meat.&lt;ref name="nrcs.usda.gov"/&gt;

== K ==
* [[Kayak]] – originally developed by the [[Inuit]], [[Yupik]], and [[Aleut]] to hunt on inland lakes, rivers and coastal waters of the [[Arctic Ocean]], [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], [[Bering Sea]] and [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific]] oceans

== L ==
[[File:Llama, peru, machu picchu.jpg|thumb|Llama overlooking Machu Pichu]]
* [[Lasso]] – the [[Lenape]] and early settlers allegedly record the use of the lasso as a sort of snare to trap large game. The Lenape eventually brought this to Texas, where it came to be implemented by the American and Mexican cowboy cultures.
* [[Lacrosse]] – lacrosse may have developed as early as 1100 CE among indigenous peoples on the North American continent.
* [[Llama]]s – Indigenous people from Peru domesticated llamas in around 5000 BCE.

== M ==
* [[Maize]] – first cultivated in present-day Mexico several thousand years ago, corn is currently the most cultivated grain in the world with the US being the largest cultivator of maize followed by mainland China. Over 700 million tons of maize are grown worldwide annually today in order to feed people and animals. In addition, [[ethanol]] extracted from corn is also used to fuel engines in millions of vehicles, thousands of planes, and other engines throughout the world.
* [[Manioc]] – Native Americans were the first peoples in the world to cultivate manioc.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;
* [[Maple syrup]] and [[maple sugar]] – indigenous Americans were the first to extract the sap from [[maple]] trees and convert the sap into maple syrup and maple sugar.&lt;ref name="nrcs.usda.gov"/&gt;
* [[Mathematics]] – the [[Olmecs]] and the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], who came after them, independently developed the concept of [[0|zero]] (independent of the ancient Hindus in India) in mathematics. The [[Pre-Columbian Mexico|ancient Mexicans]] also developed complex arithmetic functions and operations such as additions, subtractions, divisions, and multiplications. The development of mathematics by the Mexicans complemented and assisted them in making sense of the universe, cosmos, astronomy, architecture, and pre-Columbian calendars that were so essential in maintaining a connection between them and the gods and heavens.
* [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America]] – many pre-Columbian cultures, especially the Moche in the Andean regions were skilled metallurgists. Indigenous Americans mastered smelting, soldering, [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], electroplating, [[sintering]], alloying, low-wax [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]], and many other metallurgical techniques independent of any Old World influences. The Moche were skilled in hammering and shaping gold, silver, and copper into intricate ornamental objects, while the later Incas developed more utilitarian objects using these metals and alloys. Metallurgical techniques later diffused from the Andean region of South America to Colombia and then later to Mesoamerica, where local artists and metallurgists developed even more unique techniques using a wide range of material, including alloys of copper-silver, copper-arsenic, copper-tin and copper-arsenic-tin.
* [[Moccasin]]s – highly comfortable shoes used by indigenous Americans to travel vast distances. These shoes were often made of leather and were highly comfortable to wear. In addition, the moccasins could withstand the rugged terrain over which Native Americans traversed.

[[File:Chichen Itza 4.jpg|thumb|Maya observatory: [[El Caracol]]]]
* [[Observatories]], [[astronomical]] – Andean and Mesoamerican astronomers constructed towers to observe the movements of the planets and other astronomical features and events. Although culture groups throughout the world have observed the planets and stars and recorded their movements, the stone structures of the Mesoamerican and Andean culture groups are significant because they show the emphasis these early astronomers placed on making clear and accurate observations. In the U.S., the [[Anasazi]] built structures with windows aligned for the observation of celestial events. The most notable example of Maya astronomical observatories is [[Caracol]], in [[Chichén Itzá]]. In 1975, archaeoastronomers [[Anthony F. Aveni]] and [[Horst Hartung]] surveyed the site and suggested that ancient Maya astronomers used the structure to observe the planet Venus. The Maya, as well as other Mesoamerican culture groups, used Venus to set times for ceremonies and as a divination tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/188/4192/977.short | title=The Caracol Tower at Chichen Itza: An Ancient Astronomical Observatory? | author=Aveni, Anthony F., Gibbs, Sharon L., Hartung, Horst | journal=Science |date=June 1975  | volume=188 | issue=4192 | pages=977-985 | doi=10.1126/science.188.4192.977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Painting]] – Mayan paintings from the ancient era found in the archaeological sites, such as [[Cacaxtla]] and [[Bonampak]] are some of the most refined paintings ever to come out of the ancient Americas. Besides the Mayans, other indigenous civilizations were also known for their wall paintings including the Aztecs and the [[Navajo]], who developed the art of [[Sandpainting|sand painting]].

[[File:The Observation Tower.jpg|thumb|The palace observation tower at [[Palenque]]]]
* [[Palace]]s – indigenous American civilizations such as the Olmecs, Mayans, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], Aztecs, [[Mixtec]]s, Moche, [[Toltec]]s, Inca, [[Chimú culture|Chimú]], Nazca and many more built elaborate palaces. The Mayan palace in [[Palenque]] is one of the best examples of Mayan palace architecture there is.
* [[Parka]]s – the Inuit in the Arctic were the first peoples in the world to develop parkas. Parkas are great insulators, which protected the Inuit against the harsh Arctic winter. The pocket of air that was located within sewed caribou fur in a parka, protected a person against the brutal Arctic winter.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;
* [[Papaya]] – indigenous people residing around the [[Caribbean Sea]] and Mexico, such as the Mayans had been the first to domesticate and grow papayas.

* [[Petroleum]] – Native Americans in present-day [[Pennsylvania]], the Iroquois, lit petroleum, which seeped from underground to fire ceremonial fires. In addition, they also used petroleum to cover their bodies against insect bites and as a form of [[Petroleum jelly|jelly]] to prevent their skins from drying out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enopetroleum.com/oildiscoveries.html Early Native American Oil Discoveries]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Peyote]] – indigenous people realized the antibiotic property of peyote and used the extract to treat fevers and enhance the energy in their bodies and treatment as an anesthetic.
* [[Pineapple]] – indigenous people residing in what is now [[Brazil]] and the [[Paraná River]] valley of [[Paraguay]] were the first to cultivate the pineapple. From there, pineapple cultivation spread to Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean. Indigenous Americans used the pineapple as a source of food.
* [[Planned community|Planned city construction]] – ancient cities in Mexico such as [[Teotihuacan]] and the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]] incorporated planned city design including streets laid out in a grid pattern.
* [[Plumbing]] – the Maya have been found to be the earliest inventors of plumbing in Mesoamerica, with the earliest example of a pressurized water system being constructed in 750 A.D.—or earlier. This pressurized water system was located in the Maya site of [[Palenque]], where public baths and toilets were accessible to the residents of the ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.livescience.com/5959-ancient-mayans-fountains-toilets.html|title=Ancient Mayans Likely Had Fountains and Toilets|date=December 23, 2009|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Popcorn]] –
* [[Potato chip]]s – [[George Crum]], a [[African Americans|half-black]], half-Native American cook, was believed to have invented the potato chip, however that myth seems to be misleading. Crum's purported invention of potato chips became most firmly set after a 1973 advertising campaign by the St. Regis Paper Company, which manufactured packaging for chips. A large ad featuring Crum and his "story" was published in the national magazines, [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] and [[Time (magazine)|Time]]. It was in the latter 1970s that the variant of the story featuring [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] became popular because of the interest in his wealth and name, and evidence suggests the source was advertising agencies for the Potato Chip/Snack Food Association.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Crum]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1499968|title=Social and Economic Contexts of Folklore Variants: The Case of Potato Chip Legends|first1=William S.|last1=Fox|first2=Mae G.|last2=Banner|date=1 January 1983|publisher=|journal=Western Folklore|volume=42|issue=2|pages=114–126|doi=10.2307/1499968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Pot roast]] – in one of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] legends recorded in [[Lakota mythology]], the character [[Wohpe]] is seen creating a dish in exactly the same manner as we make pot roasts today—sealing a large chunk of meat and vegetables in a bag and steaming it in a pot.&lt;ref name="Jahner, Elaine A. 2006"&gt;Jahner, Elaine A. &amp; DeMallie, Raymond J. "Lakota Myth" 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Pottery]] – many indigenous American cultures and peoples independently invented and then developed [[Ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas|pottery in the Americas]] into fine works of art as well for utilitarian usage. The Moche and Mayans were some of the best potters from the ancient Americas, and their work still inspires awe amongst us for the level of artistry, creativity, and sophistication which such highly prized works of arts involved. The Navajos are also very skilled developers of pottery and their works in the present time are highly detailed and much prized. Many other indigenous American cultures also developed their own pottery styles during the ancient time periods and continued to refine their artwork into the modern era.
* [[Pulque]] – corn-based alcoholic beverage created in Mesoamerica sometimes called [[agave wine]]. Still popular in Mexico today.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2015"/&gt;
* [[Pumpkin]]s – indigenous Americans were the first to domesticate and grow pumpkins.&lt;ref name="nrcs.usda.gov"/&gt;
* [[Pyramid]]s – advanced civilizations in Mexico, such as the Toltecs, Olmecs, Zapotecs, Aztecs, Mayans, Mixtecs, developed their own myriad [[Mesoamerican pyramids|styles of pyramids]], usually [[step pyramid]], which served for ceremonial/religious and administrative functions. In Mesoamerica, the largest pyramid in the world—[[Great Pyramid of Cholula|The Great Pyramid of Cholula]]—began to be constructed by the inhabitants of [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] in the 3rd century BC. In the Andean regions, the Moches, and some ancient Peruvians also constructed gigantic pyramids as well without any influence from Old World civilizations.

== Q ==

[[File:Lanscape with Chenopodium quinoa Cachilaya Bolivia Lake Titicaca.JPG|thumb|[[Quinoa]] at [[Lake Titicaca]], [[Bolivia]]]]

* [[Quinoa]] – first grown and cultivated in the Andes. This is a food grain which the indigenous Americans first developed and the grain is considered to be one of the most nutritious items there is.
* [[Quinine]] – a muscle relaxant, which has been used for many centuries by the [[Quechua people]] in the Andes area of South America. The medicine was used by many Andean people to prevent shivering due to cold in the low-temperature areas in the high Andes mountains of Peru. The ancient Peruvians would mix the ground bark of [[cinchona]] trees with water to eliminate the bark's bitter taste, and then drink the resultant [[tonic water]] to soothe their nerves and senses.
* [[Quipu]] – quipus were developed by the ancient Andeans. Quipus mimic an accounting, record-keeping, and communication system that uses knots and strings in order to record valuable information related to population, economic data, food grain supplies, calendars, events, etc.

== R ==
* [[Natural rubber|Rubber]] – the  indigenous cultures of Mesoamerica were the first peoples in the world to extract the sap from [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber trees]] and then use it to make clothes, [[Mesoamerican rubber balls|rubber balls]] to be played in [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ceremonial ball games]], and many other utilitarian uses. Indigenous peoples, especially those who lived in the [[Amazon rainforest]] found many other uses for rubber. The science and technique of extracting sap from rubber trees and then using the sap to make goods made of rubber then spread to the high civilizations of the Andes and elsewhere in the Americas.
* Rubber [[balloon]]s – The [[Olmecs]] were the first people to use rubber balloons. Their civilization arose in BCE 1700 in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=QIFTVWJH3doC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;lpg=PA292&amp;dq=rubber+balloon+Olmec&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ye_EAh4QZ-&amp;sig=d9nHufgR7rYZVKNLzbBnx6VbyxY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi02eGpiqXdAhUGLK0KHfWaB6AQ6AEwEXoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rubber%20balloon%20Olmec&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of American Indian Contributions to the World]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reed boats]] – A [[Balsa (ship)|balsa]] was a boat that was constructed by pre-Columbian South Americans from woven reeds of [[Totora (plant)|totora]] bullrush. These reed boats varied in size from that of a small canoe used for navigation, transportation, and for small-scale fishing to large ships of up to {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} in length, which were used for war, transportation, bulk goods hauling, and transporting royalty and nobility. They are still used today on [[Lake Titicaca]] in Peru and Bolivia by the indigenous peoples living along the banks of the lake.

== S ==

[[File:Peace pipe.jpg|thumb|A [[Lakota people|Lakota]] (Sioux) ''[[chanunpa]]'' pipestem, without the pipe bowl]]

* [[Smoking pipe]] – indigenous Americans invented the smoking pipe and in particular the [[ceremonial pipe]] a type of [[tobacco pipe]]. This was an unknown concept to Europeans and the idea was adopted by them and was shortly thereafter brought to the Chinese.
* [[Snowshoe]]s – invented and then used first in the Americas by the indigenous tribes, which resided in the cold areas of North America in order to travel across a snow-laden landscape, especially during the long winter months, that gripped all of the region.
* [[Top|Spinning top]] – known from [[Mesoamerica]]n times. A device used as a toy and made out of wood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=QIFTVWJH3doC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;dq=spinning+tops+american+indian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ye_EAh5V0_&amp;sig=-2zOIFzweUju6yJTdfBVyNIeSBc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiLs96CkKXdAhUMP60KHRdIAqMQ6AEwG3oECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=spinning%20tops%20american%20indian&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of American Indian Contributions to the World]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Spruce beer]] – an beverage made using pine needles. Also called pine beer and nettle beer. Probably brewed originally by [[First Nations]] and predates Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Ebberts, Derek (9 March 2015). "To Brew or Not to Brew: A Brief History of Beer in Canada". Manitoba Historical Society. Manitoba Historical Society. Retrieved 28 January 2017. "Quebec was the geographic epicentre of the development and expansion of the brewing industry in Canada."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cucurbita|Squash]] – the people of southern Mexico were the first to grow squash. Squash along with maize (corn) and beans represented the three sister crops of the ancient Mesoamericans.
* [[Sundial]]s – the Inca and other pre-Columbian Americans constructed elaborate sundials for both ceremonial and religious purposes, but also for record keeping.
* [[Helianthus|Sunflower]] – indigenous Americans were the first peoples in the world to cultivate the [[Helianthus annuus|common sunflower]].&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;
* [[Suspension bridge]] – the ancient Mayans constructed a suspension bridge over the [[Usumacinta River]] in [[Yaxchilan]]. This [[Maya Bridge at Yaxchilan]] would have been one of the longest bridges in use in the ancient past. The bridge was constructed in the 7th century CE and was a very long suspension bridge with a relatively level pathway.
* [[Syringe]] – indigenous American [[Medicine man|medicine men]] used syringes and [[hypodermic needle]]s made from materials fashioned from hollow bird bones and animal bladders to inject medicine into sick patients and treat the illness of the patients, centuries before syringes were even invented in the West.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

== T ==
[[File:Nez-perce-couple-teepee-1900.jpg|thumb|Nez Perce tipi]]
* [[Tamale]]s – although largely associated with Mexico, records from the Iroquoian people show that they too made such a dish.&lt;ref name="Chafe, Wallace L 2007"/&gt;
* [[Tipi]] – a cone-shaped, portable dwelling popularized by [[Plains Indians]] (Native Americans and First Nations) of the [[Great Plains]] and the [[Canadian Prairies]]. Tipis were warm, durable and comfortable and could be easily broken down and packed. A settlement could be ready to move in about one hour.
* [[Tlingit Armor]] – The Tlingit armor is worn by coastal Indigenous Nation in Alaska and British Columbia. Tlingit warriors wore battle helmets depicting crest animals or ancestors, along with wooden visors, thick leather tunics, and body armor covered with wooden slats or coins. This battle attire combines technology, ingenuity, and symbolic power and protection.
* [[Tobacco]] – tobacco was used in the Americas for many centuries prior to the arrival of white Europeans. Consumed in high doses, tobacco can become highly hallucinogenic and was accordingly used by many indigenous peoples in the Americas to inspire dreams and dream time. Tobacco was also often consumed as a medicine amongst some tribes, although this was strictly practiced by experienced [[Shamanism|shamans]] and medicine men. Eastern tribes in the mainland US also traded tobacco as a trade item in exchange for food, clothing, beads, and salt and would often smoke tobacco during sacred and ritualized ceremonies using [[Ceremonial pipe|pipes]]. Tobacco was considered to be a gift from the gods and it was believed that the exhaled tobacco smoke generated from smoking a pipe would carry one's thoughts and prayers to the creator up above in the heavens.
* [[Toboggan]] – the [[Innu]] and the [[Cree]] nations of Canada developed a sled in the form of the toboggan. These sleds were used to transport people and cargo across the snow using dogs as draft animals. [[Sled dog]]s such as [[Husky|Huskies]] were used to pull the [[dog sled]] along the harsh Canadian winter snows.
* [[Toggling harpoon]] – first used by the [[Red Paint People]] of the North American east coast they were later used by the [[Thule people|Thule]].
* [[Tomato]] – indigenous Americans were the first peoples in the world to domesticate and then grow the tomato.The tomato was an essential ingredient that formed the basis of many indigenous foods including tamales, tostado, soups, and salads. Indigenous Mesoamericans were the first peoples in the world to cultivate the tomato several thousand years ago.
* [[Tortilla]]s – this staple food well known today was used throughout Mesoamerican and Southwestern US cultures. Although they were mainly made of corn, squash and [[amaranth]] were also popular. The tortillas were wrapped around different fillings such as avocado. Today this has resulted in the creation of the modern [[taco]], [[burrito]], and [[enchilada]].
* [[Tug of war]] – The [[Iroquois]] claim tug of war was once related to some sort of celebratory ritual they used to do.&lt;ref name="Froman, Frances 2014"/&gt; The [[Mohave people]] occasionally used tug-of-war matches as means of settling disputes.&lt;ref name="Native American Legal Traditions"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B5rR5ir_LmMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Homicide, Race, and Justice in the American West, 1880-1920], Page 133.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Turkey]] – Approximately 2,000 years ago, ancient Mesoamericans domesticated the turkey during the Late Preclassic period—from 300 B.C. to A.D. 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-08/uof-urd080812.php|title=UF researchers discover earliest use of Mexican turkeys by ancient Maya|date=August 8, 2012|work=EurekAlert!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U ==

[[Image:Inuit Ulu.JPG|thumb|An ulu in the western [[Arctic]] style]]
* [[Ulu]] – a multi-purpose knife normally used by [[Inuit]], [[Yupik]] and [[Aleut]] women

* [[Umbrella]]s – independent of the ancient Chinese (who had also invented the umbrellas on their own), the Mayans and the Incas had invented circular umbrellas, which were made from bird feathers.

== V ==
* [[Vanilla]] – the [[Totonac]] are believed to be the first to [[Vanilla extract|extract vanilla]] from the pods of vanilla orchids and use it as a special form of flavor.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;
* [[Vulcanization]] – the Olmec people of [[Veracruz]], Mexico treated the sap from rubber trees with chemicals and shaped the resulting rubber into a myriad of products such as balls, sandals, balloons, rubber syringes, etc. centuries before [[Charles Goodyear]] re-invented the process during the 19th century.

== W ==

* [[Water gun]] – some of the first water guns were more of a syringe-type device. The missionary [[Eugene Buechel]] recorded the Lakota peoples as making such toys for their children out of log rounds. However, whether or not they actually invented the device is up for debate.&lt;ref&gt;Buechel, Eugene &amp; Manhart S.J., Paul "Lakota Dictionary: Lakota-English / English-Lakota, New Comprehensive Edition" 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Whaling]] – indigenous peoples such as the [[Inuit]] have been whaling for many centuries using boats. Their [[Aboriginal whaling|whaling tradition]] in the Arctic region predates [[European colonization of the Americas]].

[[File:AztecWheeledToy.jpg|thumb|An [[Aztec]] toy dog on wheels]]
* [[Wheel and axle]] – it has been argued that indigenous Mesoamericans had invented the wheel. The oldest wheeled figure to have been uncovered, in Mesoamerica, is a crowned, dog-like figure in [[Tres Zapotes]], Veracruz, dated ca. 100-200 CE. However, the most common examples of the Mesoamerican wheel and axle are the excavated Aztec clay wheeled "toys".
* [[Whoopee cushion]] – Natives of the great plains were known to use animal bladders as whoopee cushions to play practical jokes on each other. They were so popular, a common [[Lakota mythology|Lakota myth]] actually depicts a sorcerer using an animal bladder to put a spell of flatulence on a girl who spurned him.&lt;ref name="Jahner, Elaine A. 2006"/&gt;
* [[Wigwam]] – A wigwam, wickiup or [[wetu]] is a domed room-dwelling formerly used by certain Native American and First Nations tribes, and still used for ceremonial purposes. The wigwam is not to be confused with the Plains tipi, which has a very different construction, structure, and use.
[[File:Apache Wickiup, Edward Curtis, 1903.jpg|thumb|[[Apache]] wickiup, by [[Edward S. Curtis]], 1903]]
* [[Writing system]] – Many indigenous American cultures, such as the Olmecs, Mayans, Aztecs, Zapotecs, and Toltecs had developed their own [[Mesoamerican writing systems|unique writing system]] independent of any Old World influences. Other native peoples to the north—mainly Algonquians—had organized pictographing that was close to evolving into a writing system, but was not yet there. The [[Mi'kmaq]] used a [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|hieroglyphic writing system]] prior to European arrival.

== Y ==
* [[Yam (vegetable)|Yam]] – indigenous Americans were the first peoples in the world to cultivate yams.&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;
* [[Yucca]] – indigenous Americans were the first peoples in the world to cultivate yucca.

== Z ==

[[File:Estela C de Tres Zapotes.jpg|thumb|The back of Stela C]]
* [[Zero]] – the [[Olmec]] independently invented the concept of zero. The second earliest found instance of the use of zero—in Mesoamerica—has been dated to 32 B.C. by the [[Epi-Olmec culture]]. This date has been arrived at based off the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]] date on Stela C at [[Tres Zapotes]]. The symbol used for "zero" is a shell glyph, which is seen on the stone carving. Although the Olmec didn't leave behind any statues or reliefs with a "zero" glyph, the use of the Long Count calender requires the knowledge of this concept since it's based off the [[Vigesimal]] number system, which the Olmec are credited to have created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Diehl |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Diehl |date=2005 |title=The Olmecs: America's First Civilization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of Indian Standard (IS) codes are available that are meant for virtually every aspect of civil engineering one can think of. During one’s professional life one normally uses only a handful of them depending on the nature of work they are involved in. Civil engineers engaged in construction activities of large projects usually have to refer to a good number of IS codes as such projects entail use of lots of assorted construction materials in many varieties of structures such as buildings, roads, steel structures, all sorts of foundations and what not.

A list of these codes can come in handy not only for them but also for construction-newbies, students, etc. The list provided below may not be a comprehensive one, yet it definitely includes some IS codes quite frequently used (while a few of them occasionally) by construction engineers. The description of the codes in the list may not be exactly the same as that written on the covers of the codes. Readers may add more such codes to this list and also point out slips if found in the given list.

'''Mobile enterprise asset management''' (or mobile EAM) refers to the mobile extension of work processes for maintenance, operations and repair of corporate or public-entity physical [[assets]], equipment, buildings and grounds. It involves management of [[work orders]] (planned, break/fix or service requests) via communication between a mobilized workforce and computer systems to maintain an organization’s facilities, structures and other assets.

The idea behind mobile EAM as a business practice is that it enables remote workers – employees who spend part or all of their time away from a central office – access to data from the organization’s computer [[application software]] for [[enterprise asset management]] (commonly referred to as an [[enterprise system]], EAM system or backend system), typically using a [[handheld]] or other mobile computer. This is to distinguish from the term [[mobile asset management]], which refers more broadly to the actual tools, instruments and containers organizations use to track and secure equipment and other such assets frequently on the move.

In the mobile EAM process, the organization eliminates a need for paper forms or other [[data reporting]] and communication methods ([[push-to-talk]] and radio) to move work order information to and from the point where the work is being performed.

While [[enterprise asset management]] encompasses the management of an organization’s entire asset portfolio across processes including equipment addition/ reduction, replacement, over-hauling, redundancy setup and maintenance budgets, mobile enterprise asset management is focused, by definition, strictly on the [[wireless]] automation of asset management data for such processes.

== Mobile EAM technology ==

When viewed and used on a handheld device, mobile work order applications provide details such as location, stepwise job plans, safety alerts, [[lock-outs]] and prior work history on the asset, giving a maintenance technician or other remote worker more detailed asset information as well as the ability to transmit work data to the organization’s enterprise system when completed – through a [[wireless network]], [[docking station]] or other synchronization method.

Using computer software to achieve standard mobile EAM practices, organizations often report such advantages as an increase in timely, accurate data flow between their remote workers and central management such as planners and schedulers, which thereby improves capital and labor allocation decision processes (including an ability to schedule more planned/[[preventive maintenance]] work).  
 
With the proliferation of [[smartphone]] and other mobile computing technologies, asset managers can expect an ever more tech-savvy workforce, lower costs in mobile devices and a higher propensity of feature-rich, workflow-specific mobile applications.

== Challenges ==
Nearly all challenges in mobile EAM practices can be traced to two factors: time and labor resources (including IT or [[information technology]] management) and investment costs.

Developing and implementing a mobile application architecture on the enterprise scale is not an easy undertaking by any means, as mobile applications are faced with a diversity of device [[operating systems]], output media (voice and data) and connectivity methods, contrasting with a PC ([[personal computer]]) environment where in most cases software requires relatively few, if major, updates and lower upfront costs. Organizations looking to implement mobile EAM applications often seek the help of [[technology consulting]] firms and spend months researching, planning and selecting an implementation strategy.

== Industries using mobile EAM ==
The use of [[mobile enterprise]] application platforms (MEAPs),&lt;ref name=gartner&gt;http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=172728&lt;/ref&gt; designed around [[service-oriented architecture]] principles for multiple [[systems integration]] and custom modification, and other forms of wireless computing technology for mobile EAM solutions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mobileenterprisemag.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=MultiPublishing&amp;mod=PublishingTitles&amp;mid=B4771C6F22F34E4CA3FFFDA61E0EA2C5&amp;tier=4&amp;id=CEFEEBFEA2484118849FC7820858E920&lt;/ref&gt; is growing rapidly, particularly in industries where physical assets form a significant cost proportion of organizations’ total assets. These industries can include:
 
* [[Facilities management]]
* [[Utilities]]
* [[Life sciences]]
* [[Government organizations]]
* [[Manufacturing]]
* [[Oil and gas industry]]
* [[Transportation industry]]

In such high-value asset scenarios, the asset lifecycle improvements introduced by the increase in enterprise data flow of mobile EAM processes can bring significant savings, particularly when part of an enterprise-wide capital and labor management strategy that integrates multiple systems in an [[enterprise architecture]] (EAM system, mobile EAM application, labor dispatch/[[Employee scheduling software|scheduling software]], [[GIS]], etc.).

== Market growth ==
In a 2009 study,&lt;ref name=gartner/&gt; market analyst [[Gartner]], Inc. forecasted, “for the MEAP and packaged mobile application market…we now expect market growth annually of 15 to 20% through 2013.” Gartner attributes this anticipated growth to enterprises’ increasing willingness (and ability) to extend decision-relevant information to employees, who are themselves increasingly mobile.

For EAM practices as a whole, this means that an increasing proportion of organizations in capital-intensive industry sectors (such as those above) are adopting mobile technology as an integral part of their enterprise asset management strategy – corresponding with an enterprise-wide emphasis on whole life planning, life cycle costing, planned and proactive maintenance and other industry [[best practices]].

[[File:Volvo and STAS trailer.JPG|thumb|Volvo FH12 with a STAS moving floor trailer]]
'''Moving floor''' is a [[hydraulics|hydraulically]]-driven moving-floor conveyance system for moving bulk material or [[pallet]]ized product, which can be used in a [[warehouse]], [[loading dock]] or [[semi-trailer]]. It automates and facilitates loading and unloading of palletized goods by eliminating the need for a [[forklift]] to enter the trailer. In a truck-based application, the system can quickly unload loose material without having to tip the trailer or tilt the floor as with other dumping systems.  In a bulk material application such as a waste facility, these systems can reduce double handling by allowing any vehicle to deliver material to the conveying floor and move heavy bulk materials to subsequent stages of a process.  For bagged waste, the system can also be combined with bag openers.

==How it works==
The moving floor is divided into three sets of narrow floor slats, with every third slat connected together, hydraulically powered to move forward and backward either in unison, or alternately. When all three sets move in unison, the load is moved upon them in the direction the operator wishes. Slat retraction (during which the load does not move) is accomplished by moving only one set of slats at a time. (The friction of the load on the two stationary sets of slats keeps the load from moving while a single set of slats alternately slides past.)

==Use in a trailer==

Optionally, the semi-trailer may include a movable front wall with a [[rubber]] flap at the bottom extending onto the floor, or simply a movable flap or tarp at the front of the trailer bed on which the material was loaded. During unloading of loose material, either of these will ensure that nothing is left behind, almost or completely eliminating having to sweep the floor.

It takes about 5 to 15 minutes to unload a full 13.6-metre trailer, taking less manpower, equipment and time than without the system. The operator can enter a narrow low [[gate]] and dump the load inside a building. With a conventional [[dump truck|tipper (or dump truck)]], that is often not possible. It is also possible to handle a full-width or full-length [[pallet]]s, without opening the sides of the trailer.

==Conveying pallets==
A similar system is designed specifically for moving pallets. It uses only two (rather than three) sets of slats; where one set raises the load just enough for the second set to retract. After the load-raiser lowers and retracts, then both sets move together to actually move the load. Load capacity is 30 tons and floor speed is up to 12 feet/minute.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">'''Nonel''' is a [[shock tube detonator]] designed to initiate explosions, generally for the purpose of [[demolition]] of buildings and for use in the blasting of rock in mines and quarries. Instead of electric wires, a hollow plastic tube delivers the firing impulse to the [[detonator]], making it immune to most of the hazards associated with stray electric current. It consists of a small diameter, three-layer plastic tube coated on the innermost wall with a reactive explosive compound, which, when ignited, propagates a low energy signal, similar to a dust explosion. The reaction travels at approximately 6,500&amp;nbsp;ft/s (2,000&amp;nbsp;m/s) along the length of the tubing with minimal disturbance outside of the tube. The design of nonel detonators incorporates patented technology, including the Cushion Disk (CD) and Delay Ignition Buffer (DIB) to provide reliability and accuracy in all blasting applications.

Nonel was invented by the Swedish company [[Nitro Nobel]] in the 1960s and 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dynonobel.com/&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of [[Per-Anders Persson]],&lt;ref name="NYT 1990"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/05/us/chronicle-102090.html New York Times, 1990-03-05]&lt;/ref&gt; and launched to the demolitions market in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ausimm.com/presentations/podoliak.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (Nitro Nobel became a part of [[Dyno Nobel]] after being sold to Norwegian [[Dyno Industrier AS]] in 1986.) Nonel is a [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of "non electric".&lt;ref&gt;http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Non-Electric+(firing+system+for+explosives)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8707">The '''open-circuit time constant method''' is an approximate analysis technique used in electronic circuit design to determine the corner frequency of [[complex circuit]]s. It also is known as the '''zero-value time constant technique'''. The method provides a quick evaluation, and identifies the largest contributions to time constants as a guide to the circuit improvements.

The basis of the method is the approximation that the corner frequency of the amplifier is determined by the term in the denominator of its transfer function that is linear in frequency. This approximation can be extremely inaccurate in some cases where a zero in the numerator is near in frequency.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The method also uses a simplified method for finding the term linear in frequency based upon summing the RC-products for each capacitor in the circuit, where the resistor R for a selected capacitor is the resistance found by inserting a test source at its site and setting all other capacitors to zero. Hence the name ''zero-value time constant technique''.

==Example: Simple RC network==
[[File:Open-circuit time constant.PNG|thumbnail|500px|Figure 1: Simple RC circuit and auxiliary circuits to find time constants]]
Figure 1 shows a simple RC low-pass filter. Its [[transfer function]] is found using [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's current law]] as follows. At the output,

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {V_1 - V_O } {R_2} = j\omega C_2 V_O \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage at the top of capacitor ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. At the center node:

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {V_S-V_1}{R_1} = j \omega C_1 V_1 + \frac {V_1-V_O} {R_2} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Combining these relations the transfer function is found to be:

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {V_O} {V_S} = \frac {1} {1 + j \omega \left(C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1 \right) +(j \omega )^2 C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2 } &lt;/math&gt;

The linear term in ''j''ω in this transfer function can be derived by the following method, which is an application of the open-circuit time constant method to this example.
# Set the signal source to zero.
# Select capacitor ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, replace it by a test voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, and replace ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by an open circuit. Then the resistance seen by the test voltage is found using the circuit in the middle panel of Figure 1 and is simply ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; =  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Form the product ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ( ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ).
# Select capacitor ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, replace it by a test voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, and replace ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by an open circuit. Then the resistance seen by the test voltage is found using the circuit in the right panel of Figure 1 and is simply ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Form the product ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Add these terms.

In effect, it is as though each capacitor charges and discharges through the resistance found in the circuit when the other capacitor is an open circuit.

The open circuit time constant procedure provides the linear term in ''j''ω regardless of how complex the RC network becomes. For a complex circuit, the procedure consists of following the above rules, going through all the  capacitors in the circuit. A more general derivation is found in Gray and Meyer.&lt;ref name=Gray-Meyer&gt;
{{cite book 
|author=Paul R. Gray, Hurst P J Lewis S H &amp; Meyer RG

|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0-471-32168-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

So far the result is general, but an approximation is introduced to make use of this result: the assumption is made that this linear term in ''j''ω determines the corner frequency of the circuit.

That assumption can be examined more closely using the example of Figure 1: suppose the time constants of this circuit are τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; that is:

::&lt;math&gt; \left( 1 + j \omega { \tau}_1) (1 +j \omega {\tau}_2 \right) = 1 + j \omega \left(C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1 \right) +(j \omega )^2 C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the coefficients of the linear and quadratic terms in ''j''ω, there results:

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 + \tau_2 = C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1  \ , &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 \tau_2 = C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2 \ . &lt;/math&gt;

One of the two time constants will be the longest; let it be τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Suppose for the moment that it is much larger than the other, τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, the approximations hold that:

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 + \tau_2 \approx \tau_1 \ , &lt;/math&gt;

and

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_2 = \frac {\tau_1 \tau_2 } { \tau_1} \approx \frac {\tau_1 \tau_2 } { \tau_1 + \tau_2 } \ . &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, substituting the RC-values:

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 \approx \hat { \tau_1} =\ \tau_1 + \tau_2  = C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1   \ , &lt;/math&gt;
and
::&lt;math&gt; \tau_2 \approx \hat { \tau_2} =\frac {\tau_1 \tau_2 } { \tau_1 + \tau_2 } = \frac {C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2} {C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where ( ^ ) denotes the approximate result. As an aside, notice that the circuit time constants both involve both capacitors; in other words, in general the circuit time constants are not decided by any single capacitor. Using these results, it is easy to explore how well the corner frequency (the 3&amp;nbsp;dB frequency) is given by

::&lt;math&gt; f_{3dB} = \frac {1} {2 \pi \hat{ \tau_1 }} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Open Circuit Time Constant Estimates.PNG|thumbnail|400px|Figure 2: Comparison of OCTC estimates with actual pole positions]]
as the parameters vary. Also, the exact transfer function can be compared with the approximate one, that is,

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {(1+j \omega \tau_1)(1 + j \omega \tau_2)}\ &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \ &lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp;  with  &amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt; \ &lt;/math&gt;   &lt;math&gt;\  \frac {1} {(1+j \omega \hat {\tau_1 })(1 + j \omega \hat { \tau_2} )} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Of course agreement is good when the assumption τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is accurate.

Figure 2 illustrates the approximation. The x-axis is the ratio τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a logarithmic scale. An increase in this variable means the higher pole is further above the corner frequency. The y-axis is the ratio of the OCTC (open-circuit time constant) estimate to the true time constant. For the lowest pole use curve T_1; this curve refers to the corner frequency; and for the higher pole use curve T_2.  The worst agreement is for τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the corner frequency is a factor of 2 too small. The higher pole is a factor of 2 too high (its time constant is half of the real value).

In all cases, the estimated corner frequency is closer than a factor of two from the real one, and always is ''conservative'' that is, lower than the real corner, so the actual circuit will behave better than predicted. However, the higher pole always is ''optimistic'', that is, predicts the high pole at a higher frequency than really is the case. To use these estimates for [[Step response#Control of overshoot|step response]] predictions, which depend upon the ratio of the two pole frequencies (see article on [[Pole splitting#Selection of CC|pole splitting]] for an example), Figure 2 suggests a fairly large ratio of τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is needed for accuracy because the errors in τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reinforce each other in the ratio τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The open-circuit time constant method focuses upon the corner frequency alone, but as seen above, estimates for higher poles also are possible.

Application of the open-circuit time constant method to a number of single transistor amplifier stages can be found in Pittet and Kandaswamy.&lt;ref name=Pittet&gt;

Other signals (such as sound or vibration) can be converted to voltages and displayed.

Oscilloscopes are used to observe the change of an electrical signal over time, such that voltage and time describe a shape which is continuously graphed against a calibrated scale. The observed [[waveform]] can be analyzed for such properties as [[amplitude]], [[frequency]], [[rise time]], time interval, [[distortion]] and others. Modern digital instruments may calculate and display these properties directly. Originally, calculation of these values required manually measuring the waveform against the scales built into the screen of the instrument.&lt;ref name=Kul03&gt;{{Citation

The oscilloscope can be adjusted so that repetitive signals can be observed as a continuous shape on the screen. A storage oscilloscope allows single events to be captured by the instrument and displayed for a relatively long time, allowing observation of events too fast to be directly perceptible.

Oscilloscopes are used in the sciences, medicine, engineering, automotive and the telecommunications industry. General-purpose instruments are used for maintenance of electronic equipment and laboratory work. Special-purpose oscilloscopes may be used for such purposes as analyzing an automotive ignition system or to display the waveform of the heartbeat as an [[electrocardiogram]].

Early oscilloscopes used [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs) as their display element (hence they were commonly referred to as CROs) and linear amplifiers for signal processing. Storage oscilloscopes used special storage CRTs to maintain a steady display of a single brief signal. CROs were later largely superseded by digital storage oscilloscopes (DSOs) with [[thin panel display]]s, fast [[analog-to-digital converter]]s and [[digital signal processors]]. DSOs without integrated displays (sometimes known as digitisers) are available at lower cost and use a general-purpose [[digital computer]] to process and display waveforms.

==Features and uses==
[[Image:WTPC Oscilloscope-1.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Basic Oscilloscope Front Panel Image.|Basic oscilloscope]]

===Description===
The basic oscilloscope, as shown in the illustration, is typically divided into four sections: the display, vertical controls, horizontal controls and trigger controls. The display is usually a [[Cathode Ray Tube|CRT]] (historically) or [[LCD]] panel which is laid out with both horizontal and vertical reference lines referred to as the graticule. [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays are additionally equipped with three controls: focus, intensity, and beam finder.

The vertical section controls the amplitude of the displayed signal. This section carries a Volts-per-Division (Volts/Div) selector knob, an AC/DC/Ground selector switch and the vertical (primary) input for the instrument. Additionally, this section is typically equipped with the vertical beam position knob.

The horizontal section controls the time base or "sweep" of the instrument. The primary control is the Seconds-per-Division (Sec/Div) selector switch. Also included is a horizontal input for plotting dual X-Y axis signals. The horizontal beam position knob is generally located in this section.

The trigger section controls the start event of the sweep. The trigger can be set to automatically restart after each sweep or it can be configured to respond to an internal or external event. The principal controls of this section will be the source and coupling selector switches. An external trigger input (EXT Input) and level adjustment will also be included.

In addition to the basic instrument, most oscilloscopes are supplied with a probe as shown. The probe will connect to any input on the instrument and typically has a resistor of ten times the oscilloscope's input impedance. This results in a .1&amp;nbsp;(‑10X) attenuation factor which helps to isolate the capacitive load presented by the probe cable from the signal being measured. Some probes have a switch allowing the operator to bypass the resistor when appropriate.&lt;ref name=Kul03/&gt;

====Size and portability====
Most modern oscilloscopes are lightweight, portable instruments that are compact enough to be easily carried by a single person. In addition to the portable units, the market offers a number of miniature battery-powered instruments for field service applications. Laboratory grade oscilloscopes, especially older units which use [[vacuum tube]]s, are generally bench-top devices or may be mounted into dedicated carts. Special-purpose oscilloscopes may be [[rack-mounted]] or permanently mounted into a custom instrument housing.

====Inputs====
The signal to be measured is fed to one of the input connectors, which is usually a coaxial connector such as a [[BNC connector|BNC]] or [[UHF connector|UHF type]]. [[Binding post]]s or [[banana plug]]s may be used for lower frequencies.
If the signal source has its own coaxial connector, then a simple [[coaxial cable]] is used; otherwise, a specialized cable called a "[[Test probe|scope probe]]", supplied with the oscilloscope, is used. In general, for routine use, an open wire test lead for connecting to the point being observed is not satisfactory, and a probe is generally necessary.
General-purpose oscilloscopes usually present an input impedance of 1 [[Ohm|megohm]] in parallel with a small but known capacitance such as 20 picofarads.&lt;ref&gt;The 20 picofarad value is typical for scope bandwidths around 100&amp;nbsp;MHz; for example, a 200&amp;nbsp;MHz Tektronix 7A26 input impedance is 1M and 22 pF. ({{Harvtxt|Tektronix|1983|p=271}}; see also {{Harvtxt|Tektronix|1998|p=503}}, "typical high Z 10X passive probe model".) Lower bandwidth scopes used higher capacitances; the 1&amp;nbsp;MHz Tektronix 7A22 input impedance is 1M and 47 pF. {{Harv|Tektronix|1983|pp=272–273}} Higher bandwidth scopes use smaller capacitances. The 500&amp;nbsp;MHz Tektronix TDS510A input impedance is 1M and 10 pF. {{Harv|Tektronix|1998|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the use of standard oscilloscope probes.&lt;ref&gt;Probes are designed for a specific input impedance. They have compensation adjustments with a limited range, so they often cannot be used on different input impedances.&lt;/ref&gt; Scopes for use with very high frequencies may have 50‑ohm inputs, which must be either connected directly to a 50‑ohm signal source or used with Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or active probes.

Less-frequently-used inputs include one (or two) for triggering the sweep, horizontal deflection for X‑Y mode displays, and trace brightening/darkening, sometimes called ''z'‑axis inputs.

====Probes====
{{Main|Test probe#Oscilloscope probes}}

Open wire test leads (flying leads) are likely to pick up interference, so they are not suitable for low level signals. Furthermore, the leads have a high inductance, so they are not suitable for high frequencies. Using a shielded cable (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;coaxial cable) is better for low level signals. Coaxial cable also has lower inductance, but it has higher capacitance: a typical 50&amp;nbsp;ohm cable has about 90&amp;nbsp;pF per meter. Consequently, a one-meter direct (1X) coaxial probe will load a circuit with a capacitance of about 110&amp;nbsp;pF and a resistance of 1&amp;nbsp;megohm.

To minimize loading, attenuator probes (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;10X probes) are used. A typical probe uses a 9&amp;nbsp;megohm series resistor shunted by a low-value capacitor to make an RC compensated divider with the cable capacitance and scope input. The RC time constants are adjusted to match. For example, the 9&amp;nbsp;megohm series resistor is shunted by a 12.2&amp;nbsp;pF capacitor for a time constant of 110&amp;nbsp;microseconds. The cable capacitance of 90&amp;nbsp;pF in parallel with the scope input of 20&amp;nbsp;pF and 1&amp;nbsp;megohm (total capacitance 110&amp;nbsp;pF) also gives a time constant of 110 microseconds. In practice, there will be an adjustment so the operator can precisely match the low frequency time constant (called compensating the probe). Matching the time constants makes the attenuation independent of frequency. At low frequencies (where the resistance of ''R'' is much less than the reactance of ''C''), the circuit looks like a resistive divider; at high frequencies (resistance much greater than reactance), the circuit looks like a capacitive divider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Wedlock|Roberge|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result is a frequency compensated probe for modest frequencies that presents a load of about 10&amp;nbsp;megohms shunted by 12&amp;nbsp;pF. Although such a probe is an improvement, it does not work when the time scale shrinks to several cable transit times (transit time is typically 5&amp;nbsp;ns). In that time frame, the cable looks like its characteristic impedance, and there will be reflections from the transmission line mismatch at the scope input and the probe that causes ringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kobbe|Polits|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern scope probe uses lossy low capacitance transmission lines and sophisticated frequency shaping networks to make the 10X probe perform well at several hundred megahertz. Consequently, there are other adjustments for completing the compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Tektronix|1983|p=426}}; Tek claims 300&amp;nbsp;MHz resistive coax at 30&amp;nbsp;pF per meter; schematic has 5 adjustments.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Zeidlhack|White|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probes with 10:1 attenuation are by far the most common; for large signals (and slightly-less capacitive loading), 100:1 probes may be used. There are also probes that contain switches to select 10:1 or direct (1:1) ratios, but this setting has significant capacitance (tens of pF) at the probe tip, because the whole cable's capacitance is now directly connected.

Most oscilloscopes allow for probe attenuation factors, displaying the effective sensitivity at the probe tip. Historically, some auto-sensing circuitry used indicator lamps behind translucent windows in the panel to illuminate different parts of the sensitivity scale. To do so, the probe connectors (modified BNCs) had an extra contact to define the probe's attenuation. (A certain value of resistor, connected to ground, "encodes" the attenuation.) Because probes wear out, and because the auto-sensing circuitry is not compatible between different makes of oscilloscope, auto-sensing probe scaling is not fool proof. Likewise, manually setting the probe attenuation is prone to user error and it is a common mistake to have the probe scaling set incorrectly; the resultant reading will then be wrong by a factor of 10.

There are special [[high voltage probe]]s which also form compensated attenuators with the oscilloscope input; the probe body is physically large, and some require partly filling a canister surrounding the series resistor with volatile liquid fluorocarbon to displace air. At the oscilloscope end is a box with several waveform-trimming adjustments. For safety, a barrier disc keeps one's fingers distant from the point being examined. Maximum voltage is in the low tens of kV. (Observing a high voltage ramp can create a staircase waveform with steps at different points every repetition, until the probe tip is in contact. Until then, a tiny arc charges the probe tip, and its capacitance holds the voltage (open circuit). As the voltage continues to climb, another tiny arc charges the tip further.)

There are also current probes, with cores that surround the conductor carrying current to be examined. One type has a hole for the conductor, and requires that the wire be passed through the hole; they are for semi-permanent or permanent mounting. However, other types, for testing, have a two-part core that permit them to be placed around a wire. Inside the probe, a coil wound around the core provides a current into an appropriate load, and the voltage across that load is proportional to current. However, this type of probe can sense AC, only.

A more-sophisticated probe includes a magnetic flux sensor ([[Hall effect]] sensor) in the magnetic circuit. The probe connects to an amplifier, which feeds (low frequency) current into the coil to cancel the sensed field; the magnitude of that current provides the low-frequency part of the current waveform, right down to DC. The coil still picks up high frequencies. There is a combining network akin to a loudspeaker crossover network.

===Front panel controls===

====Focus control====
This control adjusts CRT focus to obtain the sharpest, most-detailed trace. In practice, focus needs to be adjusted slightly when observing quite-different signals, which means that it needs to be an external control. The control varies the voltage applied to a focusing anode within the CRT. Flat-panel displays do not need focus adjustments and therefore do not include this control. 

====Intensity control====
This adjusts trace brightness. Slow traces on CRT oscilloscopes need less, and fast ones, especially if not often repeated, require more brightness. On flat panels, however, trace brightness is essentially independent of sweep speed, because the internal signal processing effectively synthesizes the display from the digitized data.

====Astigmatism====
Can also be called "Shape" or "spot shape". Adjusts the relative voltages on two of the CRT anodes such that a displayed spot changes from elliptical in one plane through a circular spot to an ellipse at 90 degrees to the first. This control may be absent from simpler oscilloscope designs or may even be an internal control. It is not necessary with flat panel displays.

====Beam finder====
Modern oscilloscopes have direct-coupled deflection amplifiers, which means the trace could be deflected off-screen. They also might have their beam blanked without the operator knowing it. To help in restoring a visible display, the beam finder circuit overrides any blanking and limits the beam deflected to the visible portion of the screen. Beam-finder circuits often distort the trace while activated.

====Graticule====
The graticule is a grid of squares that serve as reference marks for measuring the displayed trace. These markings, whether located directly on the screen or on a removable plastic filter, usually consist of a 1&amp;nbsp;cm grid with closer tick marks (often at 2&amp;nbsp;mm) on the centre vertical and horizontal axis. One expects to see ten major divisions across the screen; the number of vertical major divisions varies. Comparing the grid markings with the waveform permits one to measure both voltage (vertical axis) and time (horizontal axis). Frequency can also be determined by measuring the waveform period and calculating its reciprocal.

On old and lower-cost CRT oscilloscopes the graticule is a sheet of plastic, often with light-diffusing markings and concealed lamps at the edge of the graticule. The lamps had a brightness control. Higher-cost instruments have the graticule marked on the inside face of the CRT, to eliminate [[parallax error]]s; better ones also had adjustable edge illumination with diffusing markings. (Diffusing markings appear bright.) Digital oscilloscopes, however, generate the graticule markings on the display in the same way as the trace.

External graticules also protect the glass face of the CRT from accidental impact. Some CRT oscilloscopes with internal graticules have an unmarked tinted sheet plastic light filter to enhance trace contrast; this also serves to protect the faceplate of the CRT.

Accuracy and resolution of measurements using a graticule is relatively limited; better instruments sometimes have movable bright markers on the trace that permit internal circuits to make more refined measurements.

Both calibrated vertical sensitivity and calibrated horizontal time are set in 1 - 2 - 5 - 10 steps. This leads, however, to some awkward interpretations of minor divisions.

Digital oscilloscopes generate the graticule digitally, which means that the scale can vary, and accuracy of readings is much improved.

====Timebase controls====
[[File:CROtperdivisionincrease.gif|thumb|Computer Model of the impact of increasing the timebase time/division.]] These select the horizontal speed of the CRT's spot as it creates the trace; this process is commonly referred to as the sweep. In all but the least-costly modern oscilloscopes, the '''sweep speed''' is selectable and calibrated in units of time per major graticule division. Quite a wide range of sweep speeds is generally provided, from seconds to as fast as picoseconds (in the fastest) per division. Usually, a '''continuously-variable control''' (often a knob in front of the calibrated selector knob) offers uncalibrated speeds, typically slower than calibrated. This control provides a range somewhat greater than that of consecutive calibrated steps, making any speed available between the extremes.

====Holdoff control====
Found on some better analog oscilloscopes, this varies the time (holdoff) during which the sweep circuit ignores triggers. It provides a stable display of some repetitive events in which some triggers would create confusing displays. It is usually set to minimum, because a longer time decreases the number of sweeps per second, resulting in a dimmer trace. See [[#Holdoff|Holdoff]] for a more detailed description.

====Vertical sensitivity, coupling, and polarity controls====
To accommodate a wide range of input amplitudes, a switch selects '''calibrated sensitivity''' of the vertical deflection. Another control, often in front of the calibrated-selector knob, offers a '''continuously-variable sensitivity''' over a limited range from calibrated to less-sensitive settings.

Often the observed signal is offset by a steady component, and only the changes are of interest. A switch ('''AC''' position) connects a capacitor in series with the input that passes only the changes (provided that they are not too slow -- "slow" would mean visible). However, when the signal has a fixed offset of interest, or changes quite slowly, the input is connected directly ('''DC''' switch position). Most oscilloscopes offer the DC input option. For convenience, to see where zero volts input currently shows on the screen, many oscilloscopes have a third switch position ('''GND''') that disconnects the input and grounds it. Often, in this case, the user centers the trace with the Vertical Position control.

Better oscilloscopes have a '''polarity selector'''. Normally, a positive input moves the trace upward, but this permits inverting—positive deflects the trace downward.

====Horizontal sensitivity control====
This control is found only on more elaborate oscilloscopes; it offers adjustable sensitivity for external horizontal inputs. It is only active when the instrument is in X-Y mode, that is, when the internal horizontal sweep is not in use.

====Vertical position control====
[[File:CROyoffset.gif|thumb|Computer model of Vertical position Y offset varying in a sine way]] The vertical position control moves the whole displayed trace up and down. It is used to set the no-input trace exactly on the center line of the graticule, but also permits offsetting vertically by a limited amount. With direct coupling, adjustment of this control can compensate for a limited DC component of an input.

====Horizontal position control====
[[File:CROxoffset.gif|thumb|Computer model of Horizontal position control from X offset increasing]] The horizontal position control moves the display sidewise. It usually sets the left end of the trace at the left edge of the graticule, but it can displace the whole trace when desired. This control also moves the X-Y mode traces sidewise in some instruments, and can compensate for a limited DC component as for vertical position.

====Dual-trace controls====
''* (Please see Dual and Multiple-trace Oscilloscopes, below.)''

[[File:CROdual.gif|thumb|Dual-trace controls green trace = Y = 30*sin(0.1*t)+0.5 teal trace = Y = 30*sin(0.3*t)]] Each input channel usually has its own set of sensitivity, coupling, and position controls, although some four-trace oscilloscopes have only minimal controls for their third and fourth channels.

Dual-trace oscilloscopes have a '''mode switch''' to select either channel alone, both channels, or (in some) an X‑Y display, which uses the second channel for X deflection. When both channels are displayed, the type of '''channel switching''' can be selected on some oscilloscopes; on others, the type depends upon timebase setting. If manually selectable, channel switching can be free-running (asynchronous), or between consecutive sweeps. Some Philips dual-trace analog oscilloscopes had a fast analog multiplier, and provided a display of the product of the input channels.

Multiple-trace oscilloscopes have a switch for each channel to enable or disable display of that trace's signal.

====Delayed-sweep controls====
''* (Please see Delayed Sweep, below.)''

These include controls for the '''delayed-sweep timebase''', which is calibrated, and often also variable. The slowest speed is several steps faster than the slowest main sweep speed, although the fastest is generally the same. A calibrated multiturn '''delay time control''' offers wide range, high resolution delay settings; it spans the full duration of the main sweep, and its reading corresponds to graticule divisions (but with much finer precision). Its accuracy is also superior to that of the display.

A switch selects '''display modes''': Main sweep only, with a brightened region showing when the delayed sweep is advancing, delayed sweep only, or (on some) a combination mode.

Good CRT oscilloscopes include a '''delayed-sweep intensity control''', to allow for the dimmer trace of a much-faster delayed sweep that nevertheless occurs only once per main sweep. Such oscilloscopes also are likely to have a trace separation control for  multiplexed display of both the main and delayed sweeps together.

====Sweep trigger controls====
''* (Please see Triggered Sweep, below.)''

A switch selects the '''Trigger Source'''. It can be an external input, one of the vertical channels of a dual or multiple-trace oscilloscope, or the AC line (mains) frequency. Another switch enables or disables '''Auto''' trigger mode, or selects single sweep, if provided in the oscilloscope. Either a spring-return switch position or a pushbutton arms single sweeps.

A '''Level''' control varies the voltage on the waveform which generates a trigger, and the '''Slope''' switch selects positive-going or negative-going polarity at the selected trigger level.

===Basic types of sweep===

====Triggered sweep====
[[Image:Tektronix 465 Oscilloscope.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Type 465 [[Tektronix]] oscilloscope. This was a popular analog oscilloscope, portable, and is a representative example.]]
To display events with unchanging or slowly (visibly) changing waveforms, but occurring at times that may not be evenly spaced, modern oscilloscopes have triggered sweeps. Compared to simpler oscilloscopes with sweep oscillators that are always running, triggered-sweep oscilloscopes are markedly more versatile.

A triggered sweep starts at a selected point on the signal, providing a stable display. In this way, triggering allows the display of periodic signals such as sine waves and square waves, as well as nonperiodic signals such as single pulses, or pulses that do not recur at a fixed rate.

With triggered sweeps, the scope will blank the beam and start to reset the sweep circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme right side of the screen. For a period of time, called ''holdoff'', (extendable by a front-panel control on some better oscilloscopes), the sweep circuit resets completely and ignores triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next trigger starts a sweep. The trigger event is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold voltage (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going negative—trigger polarity).

In some cases, variable holdoff time can be really useful to make the sweep ignore interfering triggers that occur before the events to be observed. In the case of repetitive, but complex waveforms, variable holdoff can create a stable display that cannot otherwise be achieved.

====Holdoff====
''Trigger holdoff'' defines a certain period following a trigger during which the scope will not trigger again. This makes it easier to establish a stable view of a [[waveform]] with multiple edges which would otherwise cause another trigger.&lt;ref name=triggerholdoff&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=David|title=Oscilloscope Trigger Holdoff Tutorial|url=http://www.eevblog.com/2011/03/30/eevblog-159-oscilloscope-trigger-holdoff-tutorial/|publisher=EEVblog|accessdate=30 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128160235/http://www.eevblog.com/2011/03/30/eevblog-159-oscilloscope-trigger-holdoff-tutorial/|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Example=====
Imagine the following repeating waveform:&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Scope Holdoff Waveform.gif|400px]]&lt;br /&gt;
The green line is the waveform, the red vertical partial line represents the location of the trigger, and the yellow line represents the trigger level. If the scope was simply set to trigger on every rising edge, this waveform would cause three triggers for each cycle:&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Scope Holdoff Trigger1.gif|200px]]&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Trigger2.gif|200px]]&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Scope Holdoff Trigger3.gif|200px]]&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming the signal is fairly high [[frequency]], the scope would probably look something like this:&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:Scope Holdoff Alltriggers.gif|200px]]&lt;br /&gt;
Except that on the scope, each trigger would be the same channel, and so would be the same color.

It is desired to set the scope to only trigger on one edge per cycle, so it is necessary to set the holdoff to be slightly less than the period of the waveform. That will prevent it from triggering more than once per cycle, but still allow it to trigger on the first edge of the next cycle.

====Automatic sweep mode====
Triggered sweeps can display a blank screen if there are no triggers. To avoid this, these sweeps include a timing circuit that generates free-running triggers so a trace is always visible. Once triggers arrive, the timer stops providing pseudo-triggers. Automatic sweep mode can be de-selected when observing low repetition rates.

====Recurrent sweeps====
If the input signal is periodic, the sweep repetition rate can be adjusted to display a few cycles of the waveform. Early (tube) oscilloscopes and lowest-cost oscilloscopes have sweep oscillators that run continuously, and are uncalibrated. Such oscilloscopes are very simple, comparatively inexpensive, and were useful in radio servicing and some TV servicing. Measuring voltage or time is possible, but only with extra equipment, and is quite inconvenient. They are primarily qualitative instruments.

They have a few (widely spaced) frequency ranges, and relatively wide-range continuous frequency control within a given range. In use, the sweep frequency is set to slightly lower than some submultiple of the input frequency, to display typically at least two cycles of the input signal (so all details are visible). A very simple control feeds an adjustable amount of the vertical signal (or possibly, a related external signal) to the sweep oscillator. The signal triggers beam blanking and a sweep retrace sooner than it would occur free-running, and the display becomes stable.

====Single sweeps====
Some oscilloscopes offer these—the sweep circuit is manually armed (typically by a pushbutton or equivalent) "Armed" means it's ready to respond to a trigger. Once the sweep is complete, it resets, and will not sweep until re-armed. This mode, combined with an oscilloscope camera, captures single-shot events.

'''Types of trigger''' include:
* ''external trigger'', a pulse from an external source connected to a dedicated input on the scope.
* ''edge trigger'', an edge-detector that generates a pulse when the input signal crosses a specified threshold voltage in a specified direction. These are the most-common types of triggers; the level control sets the threshold voltage, and the slope control selects the direction (negative or positive-going). (The first sentence of the description also applies to the inputs to some digital logic circuits; those inputs have fixed threshold and polarity response.)
* ''video trigger'', a circuit that extracts synchronizing pulses from [[video]] formats such as [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]] and triggers the timebase on every line, a specified line, every field, or every frame. This circuit is typically found in a [[waveform monitor]] device, although some better oscilloscopes include this function.
* ''delayed trigger'', which waits a specified time after an edge trigger before starting the sweep. As described under delayed sweeps, a trigger delay circuit (typically the main sweep) extends this delay to a known and adjustable interval. In this way, the operator can examine a particular pulse in a long train of pulses.

Some recent designs of oscilloscopes include more sophisticated triggering schemes; these are described toward the end of this article.

====Delayed sweeps====
More sophisticated analog oscilloscopes contain a second timebase for a delayed sweep. A delayed sweep provides a very detailed look at some small selected portion of the main timebase. The main timebase serves as a controllable delay, after which the delayed timebase starts. This can start when the delay expires, or can be triggered (only) after the delay expires. Ordinarily, the delayed timebase is set for a faster sweep, sometimes much faster, such as 1000:1. At extreme ratios, jitter in the delays on consecutive main sweeps degrades the display, but delayed-sweep triggers can overcome that.

The display shows the vertical signal in one of several modes: the main timebase, or the delayed timebase only, or a combination thereof. When the delayed sweep is active, the main sweep trace brightens while the delayed sweep is advancing. In one combination mode, provided only on some oscilloscopes, the trace changes from the main sweep to the delayed sweep once the delayed sweep starts, although less of the delayed fast sweep is visible for longer delays. Another combination mode multiplexes (alternates) the main and delayed sweeps so that both appear at once; a trace separation control displaces them.

DSOs allow waveforms to be displayed in this way, without offering a delayed timebase as such.

===Dual and multiple-trace oscilloscopes===
Oscilloscopes with two vertical inputs, referred to as dual-trace oscilloscopes, are extremely useful and commonplace.
Using a single-beam CRT, they [[Multiplexing|multiplex]] the inputs, usually switching between them fast enough to display two traces apparently at once. Less common are oscilloscopes with more traces; four inputs are common among these, but a few (Kikusui, for one) offered a display of the sweep trigger signal if desired. Some multi-trace oscilloscopes use the external trigger input as an optional vertical input, and some have third and fourth channels with only minimal controls. In all cases, the inputs, when independently displayed, are time-multiplexed, but dual-trace oscilloscopes often can add their inputs to display a real-time analog sum. (Inverting one channel provides a difference, provided that neither channel is overloaded. This difference mode can provide a moderate-performance differential input.)

Switching channels can be asynchronous, that is, free-running, with trace blanking while switching, or after each horizontal sweep is complete. Asynchronous switching is usually designated "Chopped", while sweep-synchronized is designated "Alt[ernate]". A given channel is alternately connected and disconnected, leading to the term "chopped". Multi-trace oscilloscopes also switch channels either in chopped or alternate modes.

In general, chopped mode is better for slower sweeps. It is possible for the internal chopping rate to be a multiple of the sweep repetition rate, creating blanks in the traces, but in practice this is rarely a problem; the gaps in one trace are overwritten by traces of the following sweep. A few oscilloscopes had a modulated chopping rate to avoid this occasional problem. Alternate mode, however, is better for faster sweeps.

True dual-beam CRT oscilloscopes did exist, but were not common. One type (Cossor, U.K.) had a beam-splitter plate in its CRT, and single-ended deflection following the splitter.  Others had two complete electron guns, requiring tight control of axial (rotational) mechanical alignment in manufacturing the CRT. Beam-splitter types had horizontal deflection common to both vertical channels, but dual-gun oscilloscopes could have separate time bases, or use one time base for both channels. Multiple-gun CRTs (up to ten guns) were made in past decades. With ten guns, the envelope (bulb) was cylindrical throughout its length. (Also see "CRT Invention" in [[Oscilloscope history]].)

===The vertical amplifier===
In an analog oscilloscope, the vertical amplifier acquires the signal[s] to be displayed. In better oscilloscopes, it delays them by a fraction of a microsecond, and provides a signal large enough to deflect the CRT's beam. That deflection is at least somewhat beyond the edges of the graticule, and more typically some distance off-screen. The amplifier has to have low distortion to display its input accurately (it must be linear), and it has to recover quickly from overloads. As well, its time-domain response has to represent transients accurately—minimal overshoot, rounding, and tilt of a flat pulse top.

A vertical input goes to a frequency-compensated step attenuator to reduce large signals to prevent overload. The attenuator feeds a low-level stage (or a few), which in turn feed gain stages (and a delay-line driver if there is a delay). Following are more gain stages, up to the final output stage which develops a large signal swing (tens of volts, sometimes over 100 volts) for CRT electrostatic deflection.

In dual and multiple-trace oscilloscopes, an internal electronic switch selects the relatively low-level output of one channel's amplifiers and sends it to the following stages of the vertical amplifier, which is only a single channel, so to speak, from that point on.

In free-running ("chopped") mode, the oscillator (which may be simply a different operating mode of the switch driver) blanks the beam before switching, and unblanks it only after the switching transients have settled.

Part way through the amplifier is a feed to the sweep trigger circuits, for internal triggering from the signal. This feed would be from an individual channel's amplifier in a dual or multi-trace oscilloscope, the channel depending upon the setting of the trigger source selector.

This feed precedes the delay (if there is one), which allows the sweep circuit to unblank the CRT and start the forward sweep, so the CRT can show the triggering event. High-quality analog delays add a modest cost to an oscilloscope, and are omitted in oscilloscopes that are cost-sensitive.

The delay, itself, comes from a special cable with a pair of conductors wound around a flexible, magnetically soft core. The coiling provides distributed inductance, while a conductive layer close to the wires provides distributed capacitance. The combination is a wideband transmission line with considerable delay per unit length. Both ends of the delay cable require matched impedances to avoid reflections.

====X-Y mode====
[[File:Oscilloscope clock.jpg|thumb|A [[24-hour clock]] displayed on a CRT oscilloscope configured in X-Y mode as a [[vector monitor]] with dual [[:en:Resistor ladder|R2R DACs]] to generate the analog voltages.]]
Most modern oscilloscopes have several inputs for voltages, and thus can be used to plot one varying voltage versus another. This is especially useful for graphing I-V curves ([[Electric current|current]] versus [[voltage]] characteristics) for components such as [[diode]]s, as well [[Lissajous curve|Lissajous patterns]]. Lissajous figures are an example of how an oscilloscope can be used to track [[phase (waves)|phase]] differences between multiple input signals. This is very frequently used in [[broadcast engineering]] to plot the left and right [[stereophonic]] channels, to ensure that the [[stereo generator]] is [[calibrate]]d properly. Historically, stable Lissajous figures were used to show that two sine waves had a relatively simple frequency relationship, a numerically-small ratio. They also indicated phase difference between two sine waves of the same frequency.

The X-Y mode also allows the oscilloscope to be used as a [[vector monitor]] to display images or user interfaces.  Many early games, such as [[Tennis for Two]], used an oscilloscope as an output device.&lt;ref name="retromodo"&gt;{{cite web |last=Nosowitz |first=Dan |url=https://gizmodo.com/5080541/retromodo-tennis-for-two-the-worlds-first-graphical-videogame |title='Tennis for Two', the World's First Graphical Videogame |work=Retromodo |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |date=2008-11-08 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207052713/http://gizmodo.com/5080541/retromodo-tennis-for-two-the-worlds-first-graphical-videogame |archivedate=2008-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complete loss of signal in an X-Y CRT display means that the beam strikes a small spot, which risks burning the phosphor. Older phosphors burned more easily. Some dedicated X-Y displays reduce beam current greatly, or blank the display entirely, if there are no inputs present.

===Bandwidth===
As with all practical instruments, oscilloscopes do not respond equally to all possible input frequencies. The range of frequencies an oscilloscope can usefully display is referred to as its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. Bandwidth applies primarily to the Y-axis, although the X-axis sweeps have to be fast enough to show the highest-frequency waveforms.

The bandwidth is defined as the frequency at which the sensitivity is 0.707 of that at DC or the lowest AC frequency
(a drop of 3 [[decibel|dB]]).&lt;ref name=JGW98&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oscilloscope's response will drop off rapidly as the input frequency is raised above that point. Within the stated bandwidth the response will not necessarily be exactly uniform (or "flat"), but should always fall within a +0 to -3&amp;nbsp;dB range. One source&lt;ref name=JGW98/&gt; states that there is a noticeable effect on the accuracy of voltage measurements at only 20 percent of the stated bandwidth. Some oscilloscopes' specifications do include a narrower tolerance range within the stated bandwidth.

Probes also have bandwidth limits and must be chosen and used to properly handle the frequencies of interest. To achieve the flattest response, most probes must be "compensated" (an adjustment performed using a test signal from the oscilloscope) to allow for the [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] of the probe's cable.

Another related specification is [[rise time]]. This is the duration of the fastest pulse that can be resolved by the scope. It is related to the bandwidth approximately by:

Bandwidth in Hz x rise time in seconds = 0.35 &lt;ref name=SH72&gt;{{Citation

For example, an oscilloscope intended to resolve pulses with a rise time of 1 nanosecond would have a bandwidth of 350&amp;nbsp;MHz.

In analog instruments, the bandwidth of the oscilloscope is limited by the vertical amplifiers and the CRT or other display subsystem. In digital instruments, the sampling rate of the [[analog to digital converter]] (ADC) is a factor, but the stated analog bandwidth (and therefore the overall bandwidth of the instrument) is usually less than the ADC's [[Nyquist frequency]]. This is due to limitations in the analog signal amplifier, deliberate design of the [[anti-aliasing filter]] that precedes the ADC, or both.

For a digital oscilloscope, a rule of thumb is that the continuous sampling rate should be ten times the highest frequency desired to resolve; for example a 20&amp;nbsp;megasample/second rate would be applicable for measuring signals up to about 2&amp;nbsp;megahertz. This allows the anti-aliasing filter to be designed with a 3&amp;nbsp;dB down point of 2&amp;nbsp;MHz and an effective cutoff at 10&amp;nbsp;MHz (the Nyquist frequency), avoiding the artifacts of a very steep [[Brick-wall filter|("brick-wall") filter]].

A [[Oscilloscope types#Digital sampling oscilloscopes|sampling oscilloscope]] can display signals of considerably higher frequency than the sampling rate if the signals are exactly, or nearly, repetitive. It does this by taking one sample from each successive repetition of the input waveform, each sample being at an increased time interval from the trigger event. The waveform is then displayed from these collected samples. This mechanism is referred to as "equivalent-time sampling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5989-8794EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113819/http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5989-8794EN.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some oscilloscopes can operate in either this mode or in the more traditional "real-time" mode at the operator's choice.

==Other features==
[[File:CROsweep.gif|thumb|A computer model of the sweep of the oscilloscope]]Some oscilloscopes have ''cursors'', which are lines that can be moved about the screen to measure the time interval between two points, or the difference between two voltages. A few older oscilloscopes simply brightened the trace at movable locations. These cursors are more accurate than visual estimates referring to graticule lines.

Better quality general purpose oscilloscopes include a calibration signal for setting up the compensation of test probes; this is (often) a 1&amp;nbsp;kHz square-wave signal of a definite peak-to-peak voltage available at a test terminal on the front panel. Some better oscilloscopes also have a squared-off loop for checking and adjusting current probes.

Sometimes the event that the user wants to see may only happen occasionally.
To catch these events, some oscilloscopes, known as "storage scopes", preserve the most recent sweep on the screen. This was originally achieved by using a special CRT, a "[[storage tube]]", which would retain the image of even a very brief event for a long time.

Some digital oscilloscopes can sweep at speeds as slow as once per hour, emulating a strip [[chart recorder]].
That is, the signal scrolls across the screen from right to left. Most oscilloscopes with this facility switch from a sweep to a strip-chart mode at about one sweep per ten seconds. This is because otherwise, the scope looks broken: it's collecting data, but the dot cannot be seen.

In current oscilloscopes, digital signal sampling is more often used for all but the simplest models. Samples feed fast analog-to-digital converters, following which all signal processing (and storage) is digital.

Many oscilloscopes have different plug-in modules for different purposes, e.g.,&amp;nbsp;high-sensitivity amplifiers of relatively narrow bandwidth, differential amplifiers, amplifiers with four or more channels, sampling plugins for repetitive signals of very high frequency, and special-purpose plugins, including audio/ultrasonic spectrum analyzers, and stable-offset-voltage direct-coupled channels with relatively high gain.

===Examples of use===
[[Image:Lissajous figures on oscilloscope (90&amp;nbsp;degrees phase shift).gif|thumb|right|300px|[[Lissajous curve|Lissajous figures]] on an oscilloscope, with 90&amp;nbsp;degrees phase difference between ''x'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;inputs.]]

One of the most frequent uses of scopes is [[troubleshooting]] malfunctioning electronic equipment. One of the advantages of a scope is that it can graphically show signals: where a [[voltmeter]] may show a totally unexpected voltage, a scope may reveal that the circuit is oscillating. In other cases the precise shape or timing of a pulse is important.

In a piece of electronic equipment, for example, the connections between stages (e.g. [[electronic mixer]]s, [[electronic oscillator]]s, [[amplifier]]s) may be 'probed' for the expected signal, using the scope as a simple signal tracer. If the expected signal is absent or incorrect, some preceding stage of the electronics is not operating correctly. Since most failures occur because of a single faulty component, each measurement can prove that half of the stages of a complex piece of equipment either work, or probably did not cause the fault.

Once the faulty stage is found, further probing can usually tell a skilled technician exactly which component has failed. Once the component is replaced, the unit can be restored to service, or at least the next fault can be isolated. This sort of troubleshooting is typical of radio and TV&amp;nbsp;receivers, as well as audio amplifiers, but can apply to quite-different devices such as electronic motor drives.

Another use is to check newly designed circuitry. Very often a newly designed circuit will misbehave because of design errors, bad voltage levels, electrical noise etc. Digital electronics usually operate from a clock, so a dual-trace scope which shows both the clock signal and a test signal dependent upon the clock is useful. '''Storage scopes''' are helpful for "capturing" rare electronic events that cause defective operation.

===Automotive use===
First appearing in the 1970s for ignition system analysis, automotive oscilloscopes are becoming an important workshop tool for testing sensors and output signals on electronic [[Electronic engine management system|engine management]] systems, [[Anti-lock braking system|braking]] and [[Electronic stability control|stability]] systems. Some oscilloscopes can trigger and decode serial bus messages, such as the [[CAN bus]] commonly used in automotive applications. 

===Selection===
For work at high frequencies and with fast digital signals, the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the vertical amplifiers and sampling rate must be high enough. For general-purpose use, a bandwidth of at least 100&amp;nbsp;MHz is usually satisfactory. A much lower bandwidth is sufficient for audio-frequency applications only.
A useful sweep range is from one second to 100&amp;nbsp;nanoseconds, with appropriate triggering and (for analog instruments) sweep delay. A well-designed, stable trigger circuit is required for a steady display. The chief benefit of a quality oscilloscope is the quality of the trigger circuit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Key selection criteria of a DSO (apart from input bandwidth) are the sample memory depth and sample rate. Early DSOs in the mid- to late 1990s only had a few KB of sample memory per channel. This is adequate for basic waveform display, but does not allow detailed examination of the waveform or inspection of long data packets for example. Even entry-level (&lt;$500) modern DSOs now have 1&amp;nbsp;MB or more of sample memory per channel, and this has become the expected minimum in any modern DSO.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Often this sample memory is shared between channels, and can sometimes only be fully available at lower sample rates. At the highest sample rates, the memory may be limited to a few tens of KB.&lt;ref name=DSOtutorial&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=David|title=DSO Tutorial|url=http://www.eevblog.com/2009/06/17/eevblog-13-part-1-of-2-digital-storage-oscilloscope-tutorial/|publisher=EEVblog|accessdate=30 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128160141/http://www.eevblog.com/2009/06/17/eevblog-13-part-1-of-2-digital-storage-oscilloscope-tutorial/|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any modern "real-time" sample rate DSO will have typically 5–10 times the input bandwidth in sample rate. So a 100&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth DSO would have 500&amp;nbsp;Ms/s – 1&amp;nbsp;Gs/s sample rate. The theoretical minimum sample rate required, using SinX/x interpolation, is 2.5 times the bandwidth.&lt;ref name="samplerate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5990-9923EN.pdf|title=Minimum Required Sample Rate for a 1-GHz Bandwidth Oscilloscope|last=|first=|date=|website=keysight.com|publisher=Keysight Technologies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616103451/http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5990-9923EN.pdf|archivedate=16 June 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=30 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analog oscilloscopes have been almost totally displaced by digital storage scopes except for use exclusively at lower frequencies. Greatly increased sample rates have largely eliminated the display of incorrect signals, known as "aliasing", that was sometimes present in the first generation of digital scopes. The problem can still occur when, for example, viewing a short section of a repetitive waveform that repeats at intervals thousands of times longer than the section viewed (for example a short synchronization pulse at the beginning of a particular television line), with an oscilloscope that cannot store the extremely large number of samples between one instance of the short section and the next.

The used test equipment market, particularly on-line auction venues, typically has a wide selection of older analog scopes available. However it is becoming more difficult to obtain replacement parts for these instruments, and repair services are generally unavailable from the original manufacturer. Used instruments are usually out of calibration, and recalibration by companies with the equipment and expertise usually costs more than the second-hand value of the instrument.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

{{As of|2007}}, a 350&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth (BW), 2.5&amp;nbsp;gigasamples per second (GS/s), dual-channel digital storage scope costs about US$7000 new.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

On the lowest end, an inexpensive hobby-grade single-channel DSO could be purchased for under $90 as of June 2011. These often have limited bandwidth and other facilities, but fulfill the basic functions of an oscilloscope.

===Software===
Many oscilloscopes today provide one or more external interfaces to allow remote [[instrument control]] by external software. These interfaces (or buses) include [[GPIB]], [[Ethernet]], [[serial port]], and [[USB]].

==Types and models==
{{Main|Oscilloscope types}}
The following section is a brief summary of various types and models available. For a detailed discussion, refer to the other article.

===Cathode-ray oscilloscope (CRO)===
{{details|Oscilloscope types#Cathode-ray oscilloscope}}
[[File:Lissajous-Figur 1 zu 3 (Oszilloskop).jpg|thumb|Example of an analog oscilloscope Lissajous figure, showing a harmonic relationship of 1 horizontal oscillation cycle to 3 vertical oscillation cycles.]]
[[File:Vectorscope.jpg|thumb|For [[analog television]], an analog oscilloscope can be used as a [[vectorscope]] to analyze complex signal properties, such as this display of [[SMPTE color bars]].]]
The earliest and simplest type of oscilloscope consisted of a [[cathode ray tube]], a vertical [[amplifier]], a timebase, a horizontal amplifier and a [[electronic power supply|power supply]]. These are now called "analog" scopes to distinguish them from the "digital" scopes that became common in the 1990s and 2000s.

Analog scopes do not necessarily include a calibrated reference grid for size measurement of waves, and they may not display waves in the traditional sense of a line segment sweeping from left to right. Instead, they could be used for signal analysis by feeding a reference signal into one axis and the signal to measure into the other axis. For an oscillating reference and measurement signal, this results in a complex looping pattern referred to as a [[Lissajous curve]]. The shape of the curve can be interpreted to identify properties of the measurement signal in relation to the reference signal, and is useful across a wide range of oscillation frequencies.

=== Dual-beam oscilloscope ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cathode ray tube]] (Was also edited here.) --&gt;

The dual-beam analog oscilloscope can display two signals simultaneously. A special dual-beam [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] generates and deflects two separate beams. Although multi-trace analog oscilloscopes can simulate a dual-beam display with '''chop''' and '''alternate''' sweeps, those features do not provide simultaneous displays. (Real time digital oscilloscopes offer the same benefits of a dual-beam oscilloscope, but they do not require a dual-beam display.)
The disadvantages of the dual trace oscilloscope are that it cannot switch quickly between the traces and it cannot capture two fast transient events. In order to avoid this problems a dual beam oscilloscope is used.

===Analog storage oscilloscope===
{{details|Cathode ray tube#Oscilloscope CRTs}}
{{details|Oscilloscope types#Analog storage oscilloscope}}
Trace storage is an extra feature available on some analog scopes; they used direct-view storage CRTs. Storage allows the trace pattern that normally decays in a fraction of a second to remain on the screen for several minutes or longer. An electrical circuit can then be deliberately activated to store and erase the trace on the screen.

===Digital oscilloscopes===
{{main|Digital storage oscilloscope}}

While analog devices make use of continually varying voltages, digital devices employ binary numbers which correspond to samples of the voltage. In the case of digital oscilloscopes, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to change the measured voltages into digital information.

[[File:Siglent SDS1304CFL.jpg|right|thumb|A Siglent SDS1000 Series Oscilloscope. A modern low cost DSO.]]

The digital storage oscilloscope, or DSO for short, is now the preferred type for most industrial applications, although simple analog CROs are still used by hobbyists. It replaces the electrostatic storage method used in analog storage scopes with digital [[computer memory|memory]], which can store data as long as required without degradation and with uniform brightness. It also allows complex processing of the signal by high-speed [[digital signal processing]] circuits.&lt;ref name=Kul03/&gt;

A standard DSO is limited to capturing signals with a bandwidth of less than half the sampling rate of the ADC (called the ''Nyquist limit''). There is a variation of the DSO called the ''digital sampling oscilloscope'' that can exceed this limit for certain types of signal, such as high-speed communications signals, where the waveform consists of repeating pulses. This type of DSO deliberately samples at a much lower frequency than the Nyquist limit and then uses signal processing to reconstruct a composite view of a typical pulse. A similar technique, with analog rather than digital samples, was used before the digital era in ''analog sampling oscilloscopes.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.tek.com/sites/tek.com/files/media/media/resources/Sampling%20Oscilloscope%20Techniques.pdf |title=Sampling Oscilloscope Techniques |id=Technique Primer 47W-7209 |publisher=Tektronix |year=1989 |quote=In 1960 Tektronix made it possible to measure signals over 100 MHz with the introduction of the first analog sampling oscilloscope. |accessdate=11 October 2012 |doi= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231942/http://www.tek.com/sites/tek.com/files/media/media/resources/Sampling%20Oscilloscope%20Techniques.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Leslie |last=Green |url=http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4346463/The-alias-theorems-practical-undersampling-for-expert-engineers |title=The alias theorems: practical undersampling for expert engineers |journal=EDN |date=June 21, 2001 |accessdate=11 October 2012 |doi= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620173536/http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4346463/The-alias-theorems-practical-undersampling-for-expert-engineers |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A digital phosphor oscilloscope ('''DPO''') uses color information to convey information about a signal. It may, for example, display infrequent signal data in blue to make it stand out. In a conventional analog scope, such a rare trace may not be visible.

===Mixed-signal oscilloscopes===
A mixed-signal oscilloscope (or MSO) has two kinds of inputs, a small number of analog channels (typically two or four), and a larger number of digital channels(typically sixteen).  It provides the ability to accurately time-correlate analog and digital channels, thus offering a distinct advantage over a separate oscilloscope and logic analyser. Typically, digital channels may be grouped and displayed as a bus with each bus value displayed at the bottom of the display in hex or binary.  On most MSOs, the trigger can be set across both analog and digital channels.

===Mixed-domain oscilloscopes===
In a mixed-domain oscilloscope (MDO) you have an additional RF input port that goes into a [[spectrum analyzer]] part.{{dubious|reason=No separate port; just digital signal processing of time domain signal to take it into frequency domain|date=July 2015}} It links those traditionally separate instruments, so that you can e.g. time correlate events in the time domain (like a specific serial data package) with events happening in the frequency domain (like RF transmissions).

===Handheld oscilloscopes===
[[File:Handheld Oscilloscope SHS800.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Siglent Handheld Oscilloscope SHS800 Series]]
{{details|Oscilloscope types#Handheld oscilloscopes}}
Handheld oscilloscopes are useful for many test and field service applications. Today, a hand held oscilloscope is usually a [[#Digital oscilloscopes|digital sampling oscilloscope]], using a [[liquid crystal]] display.

Many hand-held and bench oscilloscopes have the ground reference voltage common to all input channels. If more than one measurement channel is used at the same time, all the input signals must have the same voltage reference, and the shared default reference is the "earth". If there is no differential preamplifier or external signal isolator, this traditional desktop oscilloscope is not suitable for floating measurements. (Occasionally an oscilloscope user will break the ground pin in the power supply cord of a bench-top oscilloscope in an attempt to isolate the signal common from the earth ground.  This practice is unreliable since the entire stray capacitance of the instrument cabinet will be connected into the circuit.  Since it is also a hazard to break a safety ground connection, instruction manuals strongly advise against this practice.)

[[File:Isolation Oscilloscope SHS1000.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Siglent Isolation Oscilloscope SHS1000 Series]]

Some models of oscilloscope have isolated inputs, where the signal reference level terminals are not connected together. Each input channel can be used to make a "floating" measurement with an independent signal reference level. Measurements can be made without tying one side of the oscilloscope input to the circuit signal common or ground reference.

The isolation available is categorized as shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Overvoltage category !! Operating voltage (effective value of AC/DC to ground) !! Peak instantaneous voltage (repeated 20 times) !! Test resistor

| CAT I  || 600&amp;nbsp;V || 2500&amp;nbsp;V || 30&amp;nbsp;Ω

===PC-based oscilloscopes===
[[File:PicoScope6000CDLaptop.jpg|thumb|[[Pico Technology#Products|PicoScope]] 6000 digital PC-based oscilloscope using a [[Laptop computer|laptop]] computer for display &amp; processing]]
{{details|Oscilloscope types#PC-based oscilloscopes}}
A new type of oscilloscope is emerging that consists of a specialized signal acquisition board (which can be an external [[USB]] or [[parallel port]] device, or an internal add-on [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] or [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] card). The user interface and signal processing software runs on the user's computer, rather than on an embedded computer as in the case of a conventional DSO.

===Related instruments===
A large number of instruments used in a variety of technical fields are really oscilloscopes with inputs, calibration, controls, display calibration, etc., specialized and optimized for a particular application. Examples of such oscilloscope-based instruments include [[waveform monitor]]s for analyzing video levels in [[television production]]s and medical devices such as vital function monitors and electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram instruments. In automobile repair, an ignition analyzer is used to show the spark waveforms for each cylinder. All of these are essentially oscilloscopes, performing the basic task of showing the changes in one or more input signals over time in an ''X''‑''Y'' display.

Other instruments convert the results of their measurements to a repetitive electrical signal, and incorporate an oscilloscope as a display element. Such complex measurement systems include [[spectrum analyzer]]s, transistor analyzers, and [[time domain reflectometer]]s (TDRs). Unlike an oscilloscope, these instruments automatically generate stimulus or sweep a measurement parameter.

==History==
{{main|Oscilloscope history}}
The [[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Braun]] tube was known in 1897, and in 1899 [[Jonathan Zenneck]] equipped it with beam-forming plates and a magnetic field for sweeping the trace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marton |first1=L. |title=Advances in electronics and electron physics |chapter=Ferdinand Braun: Forgotten Forefather |volume=50 |publisher=Academic Press |year=1980 |page=252 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27c1WOjCBX4C&amp;lpg=PA252&amp;pg=PA252#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-12-014650-5 |editor-last=Suesskind |editor-first=Charles |quote=occurs first in a pair of later papers by Zenneck (1899a,b) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503063825/http://books.google.com/books?id=27c1WOjCBX4C&amp;lpg=PA252&amp;pg=PA252#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2014-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early cathode ray tubes had been applied experimentally to laboratory measurements as early as the 1920s, but suffered from poor stability of the vacuum and the cathode emitters. [[Vladimir K. Zworykin|V.&amp;nbsp;K.&amp;nbsp;Zworykin]] described a permanently sealed, high-vacuum cathode ray tube with a thermionic emitter in 1931. This stable and reproducible component allowed [[General Radio]] to manufacture an oscilloscope that was usable outside a laboratory setting.&lt;ref name=Kul03/&gt;
After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] surplus electronic parts became the basis of revival of [[Heathkit#Founding|Heathkit Corporation]], and a $50 oscilloscope kit made from such parts was a first market success.

'''Otto Robert Frisch''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; (1 October 1904 – 22 September 1979) was an [[Austria|Austrian]] [[physicist]] who worked on [[nuclear physics]]. With [[Lise Meitner]] he advanced the first theoretical explanation of nuclear [[Nuclear fission|fission]] (coining the term) and first experimentally detected the fission by-products. Later, with his collaborator [[Rudolf Peierls]]&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; he designed the first theoretical mechanism for the detonation of an [[atomic bomb]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bethe, H. A.|authorlink=Hans Bethe|author2=Winter, George|title=Obituary: Otto Robert Frisch|journal=Physics Today|date=January 1980|volume=33|issue=1|pages=99–100|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v33/i1/p99_s1?bypassSSO=1|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130928152655/http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v33/i1/p99_s1?bypassSSO=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-09-28|doi=10.1063/1.2913924|bibcode=1980PhT....33a..99B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Frisch was born in [[Vienna]] in 1904, the son of Justinian Frisch, a painter, and Auguste Meitner Frisch, a concert pianist. He himself was talented at both but also shared his aunt [[Lise Meitner]]'s love of physics and commenced a period of study at the University of Vienna, graduating in 1926 with some work on the effect of the newly discovered [[electron]] on salts. 

==Nuclear physics==
After some years working in relatively obscure laboratories in Germany, Frisch obtained a position in [[Hamburg]] under the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientist [[Otto Stern]]. Here he produced work on the diffraction of atoms (using crystal surfaces) and also proved that the [[magnetic moment]] of the [[proton]] was much larger than had been previously supposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Otto R. |last=Frisch |first2=Otto |last2=Stern |title=Über die magnetische Ablenkung von Wasserstoffmolekülen und das magnetische Moment des Protons  |language=de|journal=[[Zeitschrift für Physik]] |volume=85 |issue=1–2 |pages=4–16 |year=1933 |doi=10.1007/BF01330773 |bibcode = 1933ZPhy...85....4F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accession of [[Adolf Hitler]] to the chancellorship of Germany in 1933 caused Otto Robert Frisch to make the decision to move to [[London, England|London]], where he joined the staff at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] and worked with the physicist [[Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett]] on [[cloud chamber]] technology and artificial [[radioactivity]]. He followed this with a five-year stint in [[Copenhagen]] with [[Niels Bohr]] where he increasingly specialised in [[nuclear physics]], particularly in neutron physics.

==Nuclear fission==
[[File:Lise Meitner.jpg|thumb|Otto Frisch, Lise Meitner, and [[Glenn Seaborg]]]] 
During the Christmas holiday in 1938 he visited his aunt [[Lise Meitner]] in [[Kungälv]]. While there she received the news that [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] in [[Berlin]] had discovered that the collision of a [[neutron]] with a [[uranium]] nucleus produced the element [[barium]] as one of its byproducts. Hahn, in a letter to Meitner, called this new reaction a "bursting" of the uranium nucleus. Frisch and Meitner hypothesized that the uranium nucleus had split in two, explained the process, estimated the energy released, and Frisch coined the term [[Nuclear fission|fission]] to describe it.  

Political restraints of the Nazi era forced the team of Hahn and that of Frisch and Meitner (both of whom were Jewish) to publish separately.  Hahn's paper described the experiment and the finding of the barium byproduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=O. |last=Hahn |first2=F. |last2=Strassmann |title=Über den Nachweis und das Verhalten der bei der Bestrahlung des Urans mittels Neutronen entstehenden Erdalkalimetalle [On the detection and characteristics of the alkaline earth metals formed by irradiation of uranium without neutrons]  |language=de|journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=11–15 |year=1939 |bibcode = 1939NW.....27...11H |doi = 10.1007/BF01488241 }} The authors were identified as being at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Chemie, Berlin-Dahlem. Received 22 December 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Meitner's and Frisch's paper explained the physics behind the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lise |last=Meitner |first2=O. R. |last2=Frisch |title=Disintegration of Uranium by Neutrons: a New Type of Nuclear Reaction |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=143 |issue=3615 |pages=239–240 |url=http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/meitner/index.html |year=1939 |bibcode = 1939Natur.143..239M |doi = 10.1038/143239a0 }} The paper is dated 16 January 1939. Meitner is identified as being at the Physical Institute, Academy of Sciences, Stockholm. Frisch is identified as being at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, University of Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Frisch went back to Copenhagen, where he was quickly able to isolate the pieces produced by fission reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=O. R. |last=Frisch |title=Physical Evidence for the Division of Heavy Nuclei under Neutron Bombardment |journal=Nature |volume=143 |issue=3616 |pages=276 |url=http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Frisch-Fission-1939.html |year=1939 |bibcode=1939Natur.143..276F |doi=10.1038/143276a0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803185959/http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Frisch-Fission-1939.html |archivedate=3 August 2004 |df=dmy-all }} The paper is dated 17 January 1939. [The experiment for this letter to the editor was conducted on 13 January 1939; see {{cite book |first=Richard |last=Rhodes |title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb |pages=263 and 268 |location= |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Frisch himself later recalls, a fundamental idea of the direct experimental proof of the nuclear fission was suggested to him by [[George Placzek]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto R. Frisch, "The Discovery of Fission – How It All Began", ''Physics Today'', V20, N11, pp. 43-48 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Wheeler, "Mechanism of Fission", ''Physics Today'' V20, N11, pp. 49-52 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Many feel that Meitner and Frisch deserved Nobel Prize recognition for their contributions to understanding fission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindau-nobel.org/lise-meitner-fame-without-a-nobel-prize/|title=Fame without a Nobel Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1939 Frisch left Denmark for what he anticipated would be a short trip to [[Birmingham]], but the outbreak of [[World War II]] precluded his return. With war on his mind, he and the physicist [[Rudolf Peierls]] produced the [[Frisch–Peierls memorandum]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], which was the first document to set out a process by which an atomic explosion could be generated. Their process would use separated uranium-235, which would require a fairly small [[Critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]] and could be made to achieve criticality using conventional explosives to create an immensely powerful detonation. The memorandum went on to predict the effects of such an explosion—from the initial blast to the resulting [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]]. This memorandum was the basis of British work on building an atomic device (the [[Tube Alloys]] project) and also that of the [[Manhattan Project]] on which Frisch worked as [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|part of the British delegation]]. Frisch and [[Rudolf Peierls]] worked together in the Physics Department at the [[University of Birmingham]] 1939–40.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/documents/culture/bookletfinalpdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He went to America in 1943 having been hurriedly made a [[British subject|British citizen]].

==Manhattan Project==
[[File:Godiva-before-scrammed.jpg|thumb|alt=Complex scientific apparatus with metal frame surrounding three sections of a sphere held in the center by a system of rods, and separated vertically from one another so as to form a complete sphere when brought together|The [[Godiva device]] at Los Alamos]]

In 1944 at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]], one of Frisch's tasks as the leader of the Critical Assemblies group was to accurately determine the exact amount of [[enriched uranium]] which would be required to create the critical mass, the mass of uranium which would sustain a nuclear chain reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rhodes |first=Richard |title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb |pages=612–613 |location= |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1986 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did this by stacking several dozen 3&amp;nbsp;cm bars of enriched uranium hydride at a time and measuring rising neutron activity as the critical mass was approached. The [[hydrogen]] in the metal bars increased the time that the reaction required to accelerate. One day Frisch almost caused a runaway reaction by leaning over the stack, which he termed the "[[Lady Godiva assembly]]".&lt;ref name="Frisch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frisch |first=Otto Robert |title=What Little I Remember |year=1980 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-52-128010-9 |pages=161–162 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/What_Little_I_Remember.html?id=WNXQ0EXYyIMC&amp;q=%22lady+godiva%22 |quote=We were building an unusual assembly, with no reflecting material around it; just the reacting compound of uranium-235 ... For obvious reasons we called it the Lady Godiva assembly.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body reflected neutrons back into the stack. Out of the corner of his eye he saw that the red lamps that flickered intermittently when neutrons were being emitted, were 'glowing continuously'.&lt;ref name="Frisch"/&gt; Realizing what was happening, Frisch quickly scattered the bars with his hand. Later he calculated that the radiation dose was "quite harmless" but that if he "had hesitated for another two seconds before removing the material ... the dose would have been fatal".&lt;ref name="Frisch"/&gt; "In two seconds he received, by the generous standards of the time, a full day's permissible dose of neutron radiation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rhodes |first=Richard |title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb |year=1986 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |isbn= 9780671441333|pages=610–11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsIPAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way his experiments determined the exact masses of uranium required to fire the [[Little Boy]] bomb over [[Hiroshima]].

He also designed the "dragon's tail" or "guillotine" experiment in which a uranium slug was dropped through a hole in larger fixed mass of uranium, reaching just above critical mass (0.1%) for a fraction of a second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/11/20/here-be-dragons/|title=Here Be Dragons}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting to approve the experiment, [[Richard Feynman]], commenting on the transient danger involved, said it was "just like tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon." In the period of about 3 milliseconds, the temperature rose at a rate of 2000&amp;nbsp;°C per sec and over 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; excess neutrons were emitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/876514|title=Experiments with the Dragon Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to England==
[[File:William Penney, Otto Frisch, Rudolf Peierls and John Cockroft.jpg|thumb|Left to right: William Penney, Otto Frisch, Rudolf Peierls and John Cockcroft in 1946]]
In 1946 he returned to England to take up the post of head of the nuclear physics division of the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] at Harwell, though he also spent much of the next thirty years teaching at [[Cambridge]] where he was Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy and a fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]].

Before he retired he designed&lt;ref name="WhatLittle"/&gt; a device, [[SWEEPNIK]], that used a laser and computer to measure tracks in [[bubble chamber]]s. Seeing that this had wider applications, he helped found a company, Laser-Scan Limited, now known as 1Spatial, to exploit the idea.

== Retirement ==
[[File:University of Birmingham - Poynting Physics Building - blue plaques group - Frisch Peierls.jpg|thumb|University of Birmingham - Poynting Physics Building - blue plaque]]
He retired from the chair in 1972 as required by University regulations.&lt;ref name="WhatLittle"&gt;Otto Frisch, "What Little I Remember", Cambridge University Press (1979), {{ISBN|0-521-40583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 22 September 1979 and was cremated on 5 October at Cambridge City Crematorium. His son, Tony Frisch, is also a physicist.

'''Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy''' (PRRT) is a type of [[unsealed source radiotherapy]], using a [[radiopharmaceutical]] which targets [[peptide]] receptors to deliver localised treatment, typically for [[neuroendocrine tumours]] (NETs).&lt;ref name="JointGuidelines"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaknun|first1=John J.|last2=Bodei|first2=L.|last3=Mueller-Brand|first3=J.|last4=Pavel|first4=M.

==Mechanism==
A key advantage of PRRT over other methods of radiotherapy is the ability to target delivery of therapeutic [[radionuclides]] directly to the tumour or target site. This works because some tumours have an abundance (overexpression) of peptide receptors, compared to normal tissue. A radioactive substance can be combined with a relevant peptide (or its analogue) so that it preferentially binds to the tumour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: What Is Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT)?|url=http://www.snmmi.org/AboutSNMMI/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=5691|website=SNMMI|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reubi|first1=Jean Claude|title=Peptide Receptors as Molecular Targets for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy|journal=Endocrine Reviews|date=August 2003|volume=24|issue=4|pages=389–427|doi=10.1210/er.2002-0007|pmid=12920149|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[gamma emission|gamma emitter]] as the radionuclide, the technique can be used for imaging with a [[gamma camera]] or [[PET scanner]] to locate tumours. When paired with [[alpha emission|alpha]] or [[beta emission|beta]] emitters, therapy can be achieved, as in PRRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dash|first1=Ashutosh|last2=Chakraborty|first2=Sudipta|last3=Pillai|first3=Maroor Raghavan Ambikalmajan|last4=Knapp|first4=Furn F.

The current generation of PRRT targets [[somatostatin]] receptors, with a range of analogue materials such as [[octreotide]] and other [[DOTA (chelator)|DOTA]] compounds. These are combined with [[indium-111]], [[lutetium-177]] or [[yttrium-90]] for treatment.&lt;ref name="NatureReviews"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Essen|first1=Martijn|last2=Krenning|first2=Eric P.|last3=Kam|first3=Boen L.

[[File:⁹⁰Y-DOTATOC Structure.jpg|thumb|&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y is bound with DOTATOC for PRRT treatments. The natural somatostatin receptor ligand, the 14 amino acid peptide somatostatin (A), was abridged to the biologically more stable 8 amino acid peptide Octreotide (OC, B). Introduction of a tyrosine into the 3rd position of the Octreotide sequence resulted in Tyr3-Octreotide (TOC, C), which allows for [[iodination]] of the tyrosine residue with the γ-emitter &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I and subsequent somatostatin receptor targeted imaging. For the use in PRRT TOC was coupled with the chelator DOTA, to form the octapeptide DOTA-TOC (D).]]
PRRT radiopharmaceuticals are constructed with three components; the radionuclide, [[chelator]], and somatostatin analogue (peptide). The radionuclide delivers the actual therapeutic effect, (or [[photon]]s for imaging). The chelator is the essential link between the radionuclide and peptide. For &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu and &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y this is typically [[DOTA (chelator)|DOTA]] (tetracarboxylic acid, and its variants) and [[DTPA]] (pentetic acid) for &lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;In.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bombardieri|first1=Emilio|last2=Seregni|first2=Ettore|last3=Evangelista|first3=Laura|last4=Chiesa|first4=Carlo|last5=Chiti|first5=Arturo|title=Clinical Applications of Nuclear Medicine Targeted Therapy|date=2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319630670|page=213|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uHpTDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other chelators known as NOTA ([[triazacyclononane]] triacetic acid) and HYNIC (hydrazinonicotinamide) have also been experimented with, albeit more for imaging applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=SAW|first1=MAUNG MAUNG|last2=Peitl|first2=Petra|last3=Velikyan|first3=Irina|title=Medicinal Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry of Metal Radiopharmaceuticals|journal=COSMOS|date=June 2012|volume=08|issue=01|pages=11–81|doi=10.1142/S0219607712300044}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fani|first1=Melpomeni|last2=Peitl|first2=Petra|last3=Velikyan|first3=Irina|title=Current Status of Radiopharmaceuticals for the Theranostics of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms|journal=Pharmaceuticals|date=15 March 2017|volume=10|issue=4|pages=30|doi=10.3390/ph10010030|pmc=5374434}}&lt;/ref&gt; The somatostatin analogue affects biodistribution of the radionuclide, and therefore how effectively any treatment effect can be targeted. Changes affect which [[somatostatin receptor]] is most strongly targeted. For example, DOTA-[[lanreotide]] (DOTALAN) has a lower affinity for [[SSTR2|receptor 2]] and a higher affinity for [[SSTR5|receptor 5]] compared to DOTA-[[octreotide]] (DOTATOC).&lt;ref name="Speer-TRT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stigbrand|first1=Torgny|last2=Carlsson|first2=Jorgen|last3=Adams|first3=Gregory P.|title=Targeted Radionuclide Tumor Therapy: Biological Aspects|date=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402086960|page=122|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-mT0Lthq_54C&amp;pg=PA122|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

The body of research on the effectiveness of current PRRT is promising, but limited. Complete or partial treatment response has been seen in 20-30% of patients in trials treated with &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTATATE or &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y-DOTATOC, the most widely used PRRT drugs.&lt;ref name="JointGuidelines" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kjaer|first1=A|last2=Knigge|first2=U|title=Use of radioactive substances in diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine tumors.|journal=Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology|date=June 2015|volume=50|issue=6|pages=740-7|doi=10.3109/00365521.2015.1033454|pmc=4487540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cives|first1=Mauro|last2=Strosberg|first2=Jonathan|title=Radionuclide Therapy for Neuroendocrine Tumors|journal=Current Oncology Reports|date=20 February 2017|volume=19|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s11912-017-0567-8|pmid=28220446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bison|first1=Sander M.|last2=Konijnenberg|first2=Mark W.|last3=Melis|first3=Marleen|last4=Pool|first4=Stefan E.|last5=Bernsen|first5=Monique R.|last6=Teunissen|first6=Jaap J.

The lack of ɤ-emission with Y-labeled PPRTs is also an important difference between Lu peptides and Y peptide. In particular, with Y-labeled PRRT it becomes difficult to set up a dose of radiations specific to the patient's needs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dash|first=Ashutosh|last2=Chakraborty|first2=Sudipta|last3=Pillai|first3=Maroor Raghavan Ambikalmajan|last4=Knapp|first4=Furn F.

==Dosimetry==
Therapeutic PRRT treatments typically involve several [[Becquerel|gigabecquerels]] (GBq) of activity.&lt;ref name="IAEAbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=IAEA|title=Practical guidance on peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRNT) for neuroendocrine tumors.|date=2013|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|location=Vienna|isbn=978-92-0-129210-0|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/IAEABooks/8789/Practical-Guidance-on-Peptide-Receptor-Radionuclide-Therapy-PRRNT-for-Neuroendocrine-Tumours|series= IAEA Human Health Series No. 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several radiopharmaceuticals allow simultaneous imaging and therapy, enabling precise dosimetric estimates to be made. For example, the [[bremsstrahlung]] emission from &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Y and gamma emissions from &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu can be detected by a gamma camera. In other cases, imaging can be performed by labelling a suitable radionuclide to the same peptide as used for therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cremonesi|first1=M|last2=Botta|first2=F|last3=Di Dia|first3=A|last4=Ferrari|first4=M|last5=Bodei|first5=L|last6=De Cicco|first6=C|last7=Rossi|first7=A|last8=Bartolomei|first8=M|last9=Mei|first9=R|last10=Severi|first10=S|last11=Salvatori|first11=M|last12=Pedroli|first12=G|last13=Paganelli|first13=G|title=Dosimetry for treatment with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues.

Currently used peptides can result in high [[kidney]] doses, as the radiopharmaceutical is retained for relatively long periods. Renal protection is therefore used in some cases, taking the form of alternative substances that reduce the uptake of the kidneys.&lt;ref name="NatureReviews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IAEAbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rolleman|first1=Edgar J.|last2=Melis|first2=Marleen|last3=Valkema|first3=Roelf|last4=Boerman|first4=Otto C.|last5=Krenning|first5=Eric P.|last6=de Jong|first6=Marion|title=Kidney protection during peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with somatostatin analogues|journal=European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging|date=14 November 2009|volume=37|issue=5|pages=1018–1031|doi=10.1007/s00259-009-1282-y|pmid=19915842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
&lt;!--Needs expanding--&gt;
PRRT is not yet widely available, with various radiopharmaceuticals at different stages of [[clinical trial]]s. The cost of small volume production of the relevant radionuclides is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dash|first1=Ashutosh|last2=Pillai|first2=Maroor Raghavan Ambikalmajan|last3=Knapp|first3=Furn F.|title=Production of 177Lu for Targeted Radionuclide Therapy: Available Options|journal=Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging|date=17 February 2015|volume=49|issue=2|pages=85–107|doi=10.1007/s13139-014-0315-z|pmc=4463871}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of Lutathera, a commercial &lt;sup&gt;177&lt;/sup&gt;Lu-DOTATATE product, has been quoted by the manufacturer as £71,500 (€80,000 or $94,000 in July 2018) for 4 administrations of 7.4 GBq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Information about lutetium (177Lu) oxodotreotide |url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta539/chapter/2-Information-about-lutetium-177Lu-oxodotreotide |website=NICE |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] |accessdate=3 September 2018 |date=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Writing systems sidebar}}
A '''pictogram''', also called a '''pictogramme''', '''pictograph''', or simply '''picto''',&lt;ref&gt;Gove, Philip Babcock. (1993). ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged''. Merriam-Webster Inc. {{ISBN|0-87779-201-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in computer usage an '''[[Computer icon|icon]]''', is an [[ideogram]] that conveys its meaning through its pictorial resemblance to a physical object. Pictographs are often used in writing and graphic systems in which the characters are to a considerable extent pictorial in appearance.  A pictogram may also be used in subjects such as leisure, tourism, and geography.

Pictography is a form of [[Writing system|writing]] which uses representational, pictorial [[Drawing (manufacturing)|drawings]], similarly to [[cuneiform]] and, to some extent, [[Hieroglyph|hieroglyphic writing]], which also uses drawings as phonetic letters or [[determinative]] rhymes. Some pictograms, such as [[GHS hazard pictograms|Hazards pictograms]], are elements of [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation|formal languages]].

Pictograph has a rather different meaning in the field of [[prehistoric art]], including recent art by traditional societies and then means art painted on rock surfaces, as opposed to [[petroglyph]]s; the latter are carved or incised. Such images may or may not be considered pictograms in the general sense.

==Historical==
[[File:Agawa Rock, panel VIII.jpg|thumb|alt=A boat and an animal with horns, painted with red ochre|[[Ojibwa]] pictographs on cliff-face at Agawa Rock, [[Lake Superior Provincial Park]]]]

Early written [[symbols]] were based on pictographs (pictures which resemble what they signify) and [[ideograms]] (symbols which represent ideas). Ancient Sumerian, Egyptian, and Chinese civilizations began to adapt such symbols to represent concepts, developing them into [[logogram|logographic writing systems]]. Pictographs are still in use as the main medium of written communication in some non-literate cultures in [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], and [[Oceania]]. Pictographs are often used as simple, pictorial, representational symbols by most contemporary cultures.

[[File:Signatures from the Past.jpg|thumb|left| Several prehistoric engravings can be found around [[La Silla Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signatures from the Past|url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1705a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Pictographs can be considered an art form, or can be considered a written language and are designated as such in [[Pre-Columbian art]], [[Native American art]], Ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Painting in the Americas before Colonization]]. One example of many is the [[Rock art of the Chumash people]], part of the [[:Category:Native American history of California|Native American history of California]].
In 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage List added "[[Petroglyph]] Complexes of the Mongolian Altai, Mongolia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1382|title=Petroglyphic Complexes of the Mongolian Altai|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate the importance of the pictograms engraved in rocks.

Some scientists in the field of neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology, such as Prof. Dr. [[Mario Christian Meyer]], are studying the symbolic meaning of indigenous pictograms and petroglyphs,&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.UNESCO.org/images/0006/000678/067843F.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to create new ways of communication between native people and modern scientists to safeguard and valorize their cultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pisad.bio.br/artigos/amazonupclose_outoftheforest.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern uses ==
An early modern example of the extensive use of pictographs may be seen in the map in the London suburban timetables of the London and North Eastern Railway, 1936-1947, designed by [[George Dow]], in which a variety of pictographs was used to indicate facilities available at or near each station.  Pictographs remain in common use today, serving as pictorial, representational [[signage|sign]]s, instructions, or statistical diagrams. Because of their graphical nature and fairly realistic style, they are widely used to indicate public toilets, or places such as airports and train stations.  Because they are a concise way to communicate a concept to people who speak many different languages, pictograms are also used extensively at the [[Olympics]], and are redesigned for each set of games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pages.uncc.edu/visualrhetoric/projects/illustration-video/olympic-pictograms/ Visual Rhetoric - Olympic Pictograms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mediamadegreat.com/olympic-pictograms/ Olympic Pictograms: Design through History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://1stmuse.com/pictograms/ Olympic Games Pictograms]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pictographic writing as a modernist poetic technique is credited to [[Ezra Pound]], though French [[surrealism|surrealists]] accurately credit the [[Pacific Northwest]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] of [[Alaska]] who introduced writing, via [[totem pole]]s, to [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed 2003, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artist [[Xu Bing]] created Book from the Ground, a universal language made up of pictograms collected from around the world. A Book from the Ground chat program has been exhibited in museums and galleries internationally.

Pictograms are used in many areas of modern life for commodity purposes, often as a [[formal language]] (see the [[#In mathematics|In mathematics]] section).

==In mathematics==
[[File:Titanic casualties.svg|thumb|300px|alt=table with boxes instead of numbers, the amounts and sizes of boxes represent amounts of people|A compound pictogram showing the breakdown of the survivors and deaths of the maiden voyage of the [[RMS Titanic]] by class and age/gender.]]

In statistics, pictograms are charts in which icons represent numbers to make it more interesting and easier to understand. A key is often included to indicate what each icon represents. All icons must be of the same size, but a fraction of an icon can be used to show the respective fraction of that amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/skillswise/factsheet/ma37grap-e3-f-pictograms|title=Understanding pictograms|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
! Day !! Letters sent
|-
| Monday || 10
|-
| Tuesday || 17
|-
| Wednesday || 29
|-
| Thursday || 41
|-
| Friday || 18
|}
can be graphed as follows:
{| class="wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
|+
! Day !! Letters sent
|-
| Monday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=one envelope]]
|-
| Tuesday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=one envelope]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Image from the Silk icon theme by Mark James half left.svg|alt=and a half]]
|-
| Wednesday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=three envelopes]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]
|-
| Thursday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=four envelopes]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]
|-
| Friday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=two envelopes]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]
|}
Key: [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=one envelope]] = 10 letters

As the values are rounded to the nearest 5 letters, the second icon on Tuesday is the left half of the original.

==Standardization==
Pictographs can often transcend languages in that they can communicate to speakers of a number of tongues and language families equally effectively, even if the languages and cultures are completely different. This is why [[Road signs in the United States|road signs]] and similar pictographic material are often applied as global standards expected to be understood by nearly all.

A standard set of pictographs was defined in the [[international standard]] ''[[ISO 7001]]: Public Information Symbols''. Other common sets of pictographs are the [[laundry symbols]] used on clothing tags and the [[GHS hazard pictograms|chemical hazard symbols]] as standardized by the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals|GHS system]].

Pictograms have been popularized in use on the [[World Wide Web|web]] and in [[software]], better known as "[[Computer icon|icon]]s" displayed on a computer screen in order to help user navigate a computer system or mobile device.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3459">[[Image:PorringerConey-BMA.jpg|thumb|A silver porringer created by [[John_Coney_(silversmith)|John Coney]], c. 1710, [[Birmingham Museum of Art]]]]

A '''porringer''' is a shallow bowl, between 4 and 6 inches (100 to 150mm) in diameter, and 1½" to 3" (40 to 80mm) deep; the form originated in the medieval period in Europe and was made in wood, ceramic, [[pewter]] and [[silver]]. They had flat, horizontal handles. Colonial porringers tended to have one handle, whereas European ones tended to have two handles on opposite sides,&lt;ref name=Gottesman&gt;{{cite news|author=Rita Susswein Gottesman|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/evolution-of-new-york-silver-porringer-handles/ |title=Flashback: Evolution of New York Silver Porringer Handles|work=[[Collectors Weekly|Collectorsweekly.com]]|date=April 3, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on which the owner's initials were sometimes engraved, and they occasionally came with a lid. Porringers resembled the smaller [[quaich]], a Scottish drinking vessel.

One can discern authentic pewter porringers in much the same way that silver can be authenticated from the touch marks that were stamped either into the bowl of the porringer or on its base. Wooden porringers are occasionally found from excavations; e.g. 16th-century example from Southwark and 11th century from Winchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Wood|title=The Wooden Bowl|publisher=Stobart Davies Limited|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous colonial porringers are probably those made by [[Paul Revere]].

In more modern times, some manufacturers of porringers have produced them without handles. These types of porringers appear to be deep bowls, with the sides being nearly totally flat. Porringers are also used less and less, as a bowl will suffice for most people; porringers, however, are still circulated, mainly as a Christening-gift.

A second, modern usage, for the term porringer is a double saucepan similar to a [[bain-marie]] used for cooking [[porridge]]. The porridge is cooked gently in the inner saucepan, heated by steam from boiling water in the outer saucepan. This ensures the porridge does not burn and allows a longer cooking time so that the oats can absorb the water or milk in which they are cooked more completely. Also the porridge does not need stirring during the cooking process, which means the oats maintain their structural integrity and the porridge has a better mouthfeel and texture. The lower heat may also degrade less of the beta-glucan in the oats, which gives oats their cholesterol-lowering properties.

Porringers were also made out of red earthenware clay in a type of pottery that is called "redware" today but called "earthen" during colonial and Early America. These would have the typical strap or pulled handle that is familiar on mugs and cups today. 

Some collectors or materials historians also call what resembles the pewter porringer a "bleeding cup".

'''MKNAOMI''' was the code name for a joint [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]/[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] research program lasting from the 1950s through the 1970s. Unclassified information about the MKNAOMI program and the related Special Operations Division is scarce. It is generally reported to be a successor to the [[Project MKULTRA|MKULTRA project]] and to have focused on biological projects including [[biological warfare]] agents—specifically, to store materials that could either incapacitate or kill a test subject and to develop devices for the diffusion of such materials.&lt;ref&gt;Estabrooks, G.H. Hypnosis comes of age. Science Digest, 44-50, April 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Gillmor|Gillmor, D.]] ''I Swear By Apollo. Dr. [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Ewen Cameron]] and the CIA-Brainwashing Experiments''. Montreal: Eden Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0920792723}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheflin, A.W., &amp; Opton, E.M.

Washington, DC: [[American Psychiatric Press]], 1990. {{ISBN|0880483636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first twenty years of its establishment, the [[CIA]] engaged in various projects designed to increase U.S. [[NBC warfare|biological and chemical warfare]] capabilities. Project MKNAOMI was initiated to provide the CIA with a covert support base to meet its top-secret operational requirements. The purpose was to establish a robust arsenal within the [[CIA's Technical Services Division]] (TSD) of various lethal and incapacitating materials. This would enable the TSD to serve as a highly maintained center for the circulation of biological and chemical materials.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Surveillance, testing, upgrading, and the evaluation of special materials and items were also provided by MKNAOMI so as to ensure that no defects and unwanted contingencies emerged during operational conditions. For these purposes the U.S. Army's [[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations Command]] (SOC) was assigned to assist the CIA in the development, testing, and maintenance procedures for the biological agents and delivery systems (1952). Both the CIA and SOC also modified guns that fired special darts coated with biological agents and various poisonous pills. The darts would incapacitate guard dogs, infiltrate the area that the dogs were guarding, and then awaken the dogs upon exiting the facility. In addition, the SOC was designated to research the potentials for using biological agents against other animals and crops.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A 1967 CIA memo which was uncovered by the [[Church Committee]] was evidence of at least three covert techniques for attacking and poisoning crops that had been examined under field conditions. On November 25, 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] abolished any military practice involving biological weapons and Project MKNAOMI was dissolved. On February 14, 1970, a presidential order was given to outlaw all stockpiles of [[bacteriological weapons]] and nonliving toxins. However, despite this presidential order, a CIA scientist was able to acquire an estimated 11&amp;nbsp;grams of deadly shellfish toxin from SOC personnel at [[Fort Detrick]]. The toxin was then stored in a CIA laboratory where it remained undetected for over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Of Dart Guns and Poisons | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913459,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 1975-09-29 | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Scoble''' (born January 18, 1965) is an [[United States|American]] [[wikt:blogger|blogger]], [[Technology evangelist|technical evangelist]], and [[author]]. Scoble is best known for his [[blog]], ''Scobleizer'', which came to prominence during his tenure as a [[technology evangelist]] at [[Microsoft]]. He later worked for [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] as a video blogger, and then [[Rackspace]] and the Rackspace-sponsored community site ''Building 43'' promoting breakthrough technology and startups. 

==Early life and education==
Scoble was born in New Jersey in 1965, and grew up about a kilometer from [[Apple Computer]]’s head office in [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name="QnA"&gt;{{cite web |work=Micro persuasion |url=http://steverubel.typepad.com/micropersuasion/2004/04/qa_with_robert_.html |title=Q&amp;A with Robert Scoble on Blogging, Media and PR |date=2004-04-29 |first=Steve |last=Rubel |accessdate=2006-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614155752/http://steverubel.typepad.com/micropersuasion/2004/04/qa_with_robert_.html |archivedate=2006-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 he dropped out without finishing his degree in [[journalism]] from [[San Jose State University]]’s School of Journalism and Mass Communications.&lt;ref name="mainfunction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainfunction.com/DotNetInAction/Technologies/display.aspx?ID=2862&amp;TypeID=11 |title=Meet Robert Scoble! |date=2005-11-18 |publisher=Microsoft MainFunction |work=MSDN Academic Alliance Community Center |accessdate=2006-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329024835/https://www.mainfunction.com/DotNetInAction/Technologies/display.aspx?ID=2862&amp;TypeID=11 |archivedate=March 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "scoble_dropout"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://scobleizer.com/playstation-3-mania-in-san-francisco/#comment-142422 |title = Robert Scoble still need 3 credits to graduate | first =Robert|last= Scoble|date= 2006-11-16|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source-inline|date=November 2011}}

==Career==

===Microsoft===
In June 2003 Scoble accepted a position at Microsoft. ''[[The Economist]]'' described Scoble’s influence in its February 15, 2005 edition:&lt;ref name="CHO"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/people/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3644293 |title= Chief humanising officer |date=2005-02-10 |work=The Economist |accessdate= 2006-08-26}} An article that describes Scoble’s role at Microsoft&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Cquote |He has become a minor celebrity among geeks worldwide, who read his blog religiously. Impressively, he has also succeeded where small armies of more conventional public-relations types have been failing abjectly for years: he has made Microsoft, with its history of monopolistic bullying, appear marginally but noticeably less evil to the outside world, and especially to the independent software developers that are his core audience}}

On June 10, 2006, Scoble announced&lt;ref name= "leaving"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://scobleizer.com/correcting-the-record-about-microsoft/ |title=Correcting the Record about Microsoft |date = 2006-06-10 |first=Robert |last=Scoble |work=The Scobleizer Weblog | accessdate =2006-08-28}} Robert posting about why he left Microsoft&lt;/ref&gt; he was leaving Microsoft to join Podtech.net as vice president of media development with a higher salary accompanied by "a quite aggressive stock option"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,24897,19443297-15306,00.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171019002824/http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,24897,19443297-15306,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-10-19 | title =Blogger Scoble Quits Microsoft|date=2006-06-12 |work=Australian IT}} &lt;/ref&gt; offer that would have made him wealthy if his new company had succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5070940.stm |title = Top Microsoft Blogger to Resign |date=2006-06-12 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/06/12/gates-microsoft-scoble-cx_po_0612autofacescan01.html |title=Ballmer’s Microsoft Loses Admired Tech Evangelist |date = 2006-06-12 |first = Parmy | last =Olson |work = Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alexa Internet]] that day had the biggest traffic to his blog and PodTech over their lifetime.&lt;ref name="alexa.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?compare_sites=podtech.net&amp;range=2y&amp;size=medium&amp;y=r&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fscobleizer.wordpress.com%2F |title=Traffic report for Scobleizer blog and PodTech.net|work=Alexa |accessdate=2006-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; June 28, 2006 was his last day at Microsoft.

===Fast Company===
On December 11, 2007, while taking part in a panel discussion at the LeWeb3 Conference, Scoble inadvertently leaked news (by loading up a post on TechCrunch) that he would be leaving PodTech on January 14, 2008, and was likely to join Fast Company. He acknowledged the news on his blog on December 12 but stated that he had not yet signed on with Fast Company. He did a video interview about his plans&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Crampton | first = Thomas | date = Dec 12, 2007 | url = http://www.thomascrampton.com/2007/12/12/robert-scoble-after-podtech-and-his-plans-for-fast-company/ | title = Robert Scoble after Podtech &amp; his plans for Fast co}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and leased studio space from [[Revision3]].

On March 3, 2008, Scoble launched [[FastCompany.tv]] with two shows: FastCompany Live and [[ScobleizerTV]].  He characterizes the first as "a show done totally on cell phones."  The second is similar to his previous show on PodTech, only with better equipment and a camera operator.  The show is recorded with two cameras in 720p HD.&lt;ref name = FastCompany&gt;{{Citation | date = Mar 3, 2008 | contribution-url = http://scobleizer.com/fastcompanytv-launches/ | title = Scobleizer | contribution = FastCompany.TV launches}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rackspace and Building 43===
On March 14, 2009, Scoble announced via his blog and on the Gillmor Gang that he was joining [[Rackspace]].  As part of his work there, he teamed up with the company to develop [[Building 43]], a new content and social networking website aimed to help grow new startups and promote groundbreaking technology. In 2012, Building 43 was re-branded as ''Small Teams, Big Impact''.  Scoble’s mission remains to find and report bleeding edge technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://scobleizer.com/scalable-livin/ | contribution = Scalable Living: changes you can make to be more productive | title = Scobleizer | date = 2012-07-02 | accessdate = 2014-05-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scoble left Rackspace to join [[UploadVR]] in 2016 as an entrepreneur in residence. &lt;ref name="uploadvr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scoble|first1=Robert|title=Why I Joined the VR Revolution|url=https://uploadvr.com/scoble-why-vr/|website=UploadVR|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of sexual harassment and assault==
On October 20, 2017, the news outlet [[BuzzFeed]] published a story that alleges that in 2010, Scoble sexually harassed Michelle Greer, his [[Rackspace]] coworker, and [[Quinn Norton]], a technology journalist, whose account was corroborated by multiple witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/doree/woman-accuses-robert-scoble-of-sexual-harassment |title=Another Woman Has Accused Robert Scoble of Sexual Harassment |last=Shafrir |first=Doree |date=October 20, 2017 |website=[[BuzzFeed]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020085706/https://www.buzzfeed.com/doree/woman-accuses-robert-scoble-of-sexual-harassment |archive-date=October 20, 2017 |dead-url=no |access-date=October 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scoble apologized after the BuzzFeed article was published, saying that he has been working towards making amends ever since becoming [[Sobriety|sober]] two years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/RobertScoble/posts/10155785962004655 |title=I Apologize |last=Scoble |first=Robert |date=October 20, 2017 |website=[[Facebook]]|access-date=October 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several women countered this claim, reporting that he made inappropriate advances during the time period he claimed to be sober.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buhr|first1=Sarah|title=Robert Scoble has allegedly continued to sexually harass women after going sober|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/20/robert-scoble-has-allegedly-continued-to-sexually-harass-women-after-going-sober/|website=TechCrunch|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Days later, he deleted his apology, and proclaimed his innocence in a blog post that also announced his new company, LightPitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scobleizer.blog/2017/10/25/no-of-that-im-innocent-sexual-harassment-assault-accusations/|title=No, of that I’m innocent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One immediate reaction was by the VR/AR Association (VRARA), stating: "In light of recent news and allegations of sexual harassment by Robert Scoble, the VR/AR Association has formally removed Robert from our Board of Advisors. Our organization does not condone harassment of any kind, and feel that this is the best course of action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thevrara.com/blog2/2017/10/20/vrar-associations-statement-regarding-robert-scoble|title=VR/AR Association's Statement Regarding Robert Scoble|last=Kolo|first=Kris|date=2017-10-20|website=The VR/AR Association|archive-url=http://www.thevrara.com|archive-date=2017-10-20|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scoble resigned from the Transformation Group, his AR consulting firm, which he co-founded in late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/23/16527862/robert-scoble-resigns-transformation-group-sexual-harassment|title=Robert Scoble departs his augmented reality company following sexual harassment claims|work=The Verge|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
In November, 2013, Scoble was co-keynote speaker with [[Shel Israel]] at the 2013 [[Telstra]] Australian Digital Summit.  Scoble and Israel talked to their book titled "Age of Context: Mobile, Sensors, Data and the Future of Privacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://telstra.com/summit |year=2013 |title=Australian Digital Summit |publisher=Telstra }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2008, ''[[The Register]]'' ran an April fool’s spoof claiming Robert Scoble was actually an IBM bot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/01/ibm_scoble_nano/ |title=IBM unveils nano-projector based VirtuaHuman with 1TB of memory |newspaper=[[The Register]] |date=April 1, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2007, he was a contestant on a [[game show]] at NewTeeVee Live&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://live.newteevee.com/gameshow |title=Web Video Celebrity Game Show |publisher=NewTeeVee Live |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230184233/http://live.newteevee.com/gameshow/ |archivedate=2007-12-30 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; featuring other [[internet celebrities]] such as [[Veronica Belmont]], [[Casey McKinnon]], [[Cali Lewis]], [[Kevin Rose]], [[Justin Kan]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/businesswire/feeds/businesswire/2007/10/31/businesswire20071031005523r1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110090421/http://www.forbes.com/businesswire/feeds/businesswire/2007/10/31/businesswire20071031005523r1.html |archivedate=2007-11-10 |title=NewTeeVee Live to Feature Online Video Leaders |accessdate=2014-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2006, Scoble appeared as a panelist on a Chinese Software Professionals Association event called "The New Age of Influence: The Impact of Social Computing on Media and Marketing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.cspa.com/eventdetail.php?eid=20061106 |date=November 6, 2006 |publisher=CPSA |title=The New Age of Influence: The Impact of Social Computing on Media and Marketing |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520040749/http://www.cspa.com/eventdetail.php?eid=20061106 |archivedate=May 20, 2008 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Milliscoble== &lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[Milliscoble]]" --&gt;
In September 2008, Follow cost, a website which calculated how annoying it would be to follow anyone on [[Twitter]], invented the milliscoble unit of measurement defined as: "1/1000 of the average daily Twitter status updates by Robert Scoble as of 10:09 CST September 25, 2008." At that time, Scoble was averaging 21.21 tweets per day, so a milliscoble is 0.02121 tweets per day. A person with a milliscoble rating of 1000 will be as annoying to follow as Scoble.&lt;ref name="milliscoble"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://followcost.com/about/milliscoble |publisher=Follow cost |title=What’s a milliscoble? |date=2008-09-25 |work=About |accessdate=2008-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207053001/http://followcost.com/about/milliscoble |archivedate=2008-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sellotape''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|ə|ˌ|t|eɪ|p}}) is a British brand of transparent, [[polypropylene]]-based, [[pressure-sensitive tape]], and is the leading brand in the [[United Kingdom]].  Sellotape is generally used for joining, sealing, attaching and mending.

The term has become a [[genericised trademark]] in Britain and a number of other countries where it is sold. The term is also used much in the same way that [[Scotch Tape]] came to be used in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] in referring to any brand of clear adhesive tape.

==History==
The name Sellotape was derived from ''cellophane'', at that time a trademarked name, with the "C" changed to "S" so that the new name could be trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Room | first = Adrian | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Trade Name Origins | publisher = Routledge | date = 1984 | location = | page = 156 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7102-0174-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tape was originally manufactured in 1937 by Colin Kinninmonth and George Grey, in [[Acton, London|Acton]], West London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Century Makers: One Hundred Clever Things We Take for Granted Which Have Changed Our Lives Over the Last One Hundred Years |first= David |last= Hillman |first2= David |last2= Gibbs|year= 1999|publisher=Welcome Rain |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Century_Makers.html?id=qWJFAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s to 1980s, the Sellotape company was part of [[Dickinson Robinson Group]], a British packaging and paper conglomerate. In the 1960s a small group of chemists (based in Wallington), led by a man named Alan Robinson, undertook a  development of the stickiness in this product. In 2002, the company was bought by [[Henkel]] Consumer Adhesives.

Sellotape Industrial was bought by Scapa Group plc in 1997, and their products continue to be manufactured at its factory in [[Dunstable]], [[Bedfordshire]].

==Products==
[[File:Sellotape.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Sellotape roll in a black dispenser.]]

The Sellotape brand now covers a variety of tape products, and the word is frequently used to refer to other adhesive tapes in many countries due to its market exposure. As an example of a [[genericized trademark]], it has an entry in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].

==Use==
The tape can be used to repair tears in paper, or to attach pieces of paper or cardboard together for modelling.  On fragile paper surfaces the tape can only be used once, as removing it will either tear the paper or remove the top layer of rough cardboard; on smooth painted surfaces it can generally be removed without leaving any trace, though sometimes the adhesive can remain on the surface.  It does not affix items to such surfaces permanently.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4353">[[File:Spin valve schematic.svg|thumb|300px|right|A schematic diagram of a pseudo spin valve. The free layer is magnetically soft and the fixed layer is magnetically hard. When the magnetic layers are antiparallel the electrical resistance is higher than when they are aligned.]]

A '''spin valve''' is a device, consisting of two or more conducting magnetic materials, whose [[electrical resistance]] can change between two values depending on the relative alignment of the magnetization in the layers. The resistance change is a result of the [[giant magnetoresistance|giant magnetoresistive effect]].  The magnetic layers of the device align "up" or "down" depending on an external [[magnetic field]].  In the simplest case, a spin valve consists of a non-magnetic material sandwiched between two [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]], one of which is fixed (pinned) by an [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnet]] which acts to raise its magnetic [[coercivity]] and behaves as a "hard" layer, while the other is free (unpinned) and behaves as a "soft" layer. Due to the difference in coercivity, the soft layer changes polarity at lower applied magnetic field strength than the hard one. Upon application of a magnetic field of appropriate strength, the soft layer switches polarity, producing two distinct states: a parallel, low-resistance state, and an antiparallel, high-resistance state.

== How it works ==
Spin valves work because of a quantum property of electrons (and other particles) called [[spin (physics)|spin]].  Due to a split in the [[density of states]] of electrons at the [[Fermi energy]] in ferromagnets, there is a net spin polarisation. An electric current passing through a ferromagnet therefore carries both [[electric charge|charge]] and a spin component. In comparison, a normal metal has an equal number of electrons with up and down spins so, in equilibrium situations, such materials can sustain a charge current with a zero net spin component. However, by passing a current from a ferromagnet into a normal metal it is possible for spin to be transferred. A normal metal can thus transfer spin between separate ferromagnets, subject to a long enough [[spin diffusion]] length.

Spin transmission depends on the alignment of magnetic moments in the ferromagnets. If a current is passing into a ferromagnet whose majority spin is spin up, for example, then electrons with spin up will pass through relatively unhindered, while electrons with spin down will either 'reflect' or spin flip scatter to spin up upon encountering the ferromagnet to find an empty energy state in the new material. Thus if both the fixed and free layers are polarised in the same direction, the device has relatively low electrical resistance, whereas if the applied magnetic field is reversed and the free layer's polarity also reverses, then the device has a higher resistance due to the extra energy required for spin flip scattering.

=== Antiferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers ===
An antiferromagnetic layer is required to pin one of the ferromagnetic layers (i.e., make it fixed or magnetically hard). This results from a large negative [[exchange interaction|exchange coupling energy]] between ferromagnets and antiferromagnets in contact.

The non-magnetic layer is required to decouple the two ferromagnetic layers so that at least one of them remains free (magnetically soft).

=== Pseudo spin valves ===
The basic operating principles of a pseudo spin valve are identical to that of an ordinary spin valve, but instead of changing the magnetic coercivity of the different ferromagnetic layers by pinning one with an antiferromagnetic layer, the two layers are made of different ferromagnets with different coercivities e.g., NiFe and Co. Note that coercivities are largely an extrinsic property of materials and thus determined by processing conditions.

== Applications ==
Spin valves are used in magnetic [[sensor]]s and [[hard disk]] read heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.almaden.ibm.com/spinaps/research/smp/ | title=Spintronics Materials and Phenomena Research | accessdate=13 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in magnetic random access memories ([[MRAM]]).

'''Tannerite''' is a brand of [[binary explosive]] targets used for firearms practice and sold in kit form.&lt;ref name=patE1&gt;{{Citation|title=Binary exploding target, package process and product|date=2013-07-18|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/USRE45440E1/en|accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/samlemonick/2016/09/19/the-science-of-tannerite-the-explosive-possibly-used-in-the-chelsea-bombs/#6726070c2739 |title= The Science Of Tannerite, The Explosive Possibly Used In The Chelsea Bombs|last=Lemonick |first=Sam |date= September 19, 2016|work=[[Forbes]] |access-date=April 25, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The targets comprise a combination of [[oxidizer]]s and a fuel – primarily [[aluminum powder]] – that is supplied as two separate components that are mixed by the user. The combination is relatively stable when subjected to forces less severe than a high-velocity bullet impact. A hammer blow, being dropped, or impact from a low-velocity bullet or shotgun blast will not initiate a reaction. It is also designed to be non-flammable&lt;ref name=tannerite1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tannerite.com/about-tannerite-sports/|title=About Tannerite Sports, LLC |website=Tannerite Sports, LLC ''(official website)'' |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the reaction cannot be triggered by a burning fuse or electricity), although its explosion can cause other flammable material to ignite.

Because it is sold as two separate components, it can be transported and sold in many places without the legal restrictions that would otherwise apply to explosives. The term ''tannerite'' is often used to refer to the mixture itself, and other reactive targets and combination explosives are often [[generic trademark|generically referred to]] as tannerite.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web |first1=Mike M. |last1=Ahlers |first2=Rene |last2=Marsh |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/06/us/guns-exploding-targets/ |title=Exploding targets: shooting aid or a 'bomb kit for dummies?' |website=[[CNN]] |date=September 6, 2013 |access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

==Uses==
Tannerite brand targets explode when shot by a [[muzzle velocity|high-velocity bullet]]. Low-velocity bullets and shotgun ammunition will not initiate a reaction.{{r|patE1}}

The explosive reaction, once initiated, occurs at a very high velocity, producing a large vapor cloud and a loud report. It is marketed as a target designation that is useful for long-range target practice: the shooter does not need to walk down-range to see if the target has been hit, as the target will react and serve as a highly visible indicator.

Binary explosives like Tannerite are also used in some business applications, including commercial blasting, product testing, and special effects.&lt;ref name=ATF1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.atf.gov/explosives/binary-explosives |title=Binary Explosives |website=[[U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] |access-date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For safety reasons, Tannerite Sports recommends using no more than {{convert|1|lb|kg|adj=off}} of the mixed composition at once, and will sell its largest targets with a size of {{convert|2|lb|kg|adj=off}} to professionals only.&lt;ref name=tannerite2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tannerite.com/binary-target-faq/#7|title=FAQ's: Got Questions? |website=Tannerite Sports, LLC ''(official website)'' |access-date=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Target composition and sale==
Tannerite targets are sold in pre-sized quantities. The package includes a first, target container and a second container. An oxidizer composition is contained within one of the containers and a catalyst composition is contained within the other container. 

The product, developed by Daniel Jeremy Tanner, and initially formulated in 1996,&lt;ref name=tannerite1/&gt; consists of two components: a fuel mixed with a catalyst or sensitizer, and a bulk material or oxidizer. The fuel/catalyst mixture is 90% 600-mesh dark flake [[aluminium|aluminum]] powder, combined with the catalyst that is a mixture of 5% 325-mesh [[titanium]] sponge and 5% 200-mesh [[zirconium hydride]]{{r|patE1}} (with another patent document&lt;ref name=Pat952&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US20030033952 US patent 20030033952] (image)&lt;/ref&gt; listing 5% [[zirconium hydroxide]]). The oxidizer is a mixture of 85% 200-mesh [[ammonium nitrate]] and 15% [[ammonium perchlorate]].&lt;ref name=patE1/&gt; The patents on these formulations were applied for on August 20, 2001.{{r|patE1}}&lt;ref name=Pat952/&gt;

== United States law ==
{{See also|Binary explosive#United States law}}
In the United States, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] advises: "Persons manufacturing explosives for their own personal, non-business use only (e.g., personal target practice) are not required to have a Federal explosives license or permit."{{r|ATF1}} However, "persons falling into certain categories are prohibited from possessing explosive materials".{{r|ATF1}} Those prohibited from possessing explosives include most non-citizens, unlawful drug users and addicts, those convicted or indicted for serious crimes, fugitives, and those who have been officially declared mentally defective or have been committed to a mental institution.{{r|ATF1}} Restrictions imposed at the state and local level also apply.&lt;ref name=tannerite1/&gt;{{r|ATF1}} In [[California]] in particular, a permit may be required to use or possess the product.&lt;ref name=tannerite2/&gt;

Various regulations also govern the storage of unmixed explosives. As oxidizers and combustibles, the unmixed components still have some shipping restrictions in the United States.&lt;ref name=USPS1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c3_022.htm|title=344 Flammable Solids (Hazard Class 4) |website=[[U.S. Postal Service]] Postal Explorer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USPS2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c3_023.htm|title=345 Oxidizing Substances, Organic Peroxides (Hazard Class 5) |website=U.S. Postal Service Postal Explorer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable incidents==
A Minnesota man was fined $2,583 and sentenced to three years' probation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Welch man gets probation for explosion|newspaper=Rochester Post-Bulletin|date=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on charges of detonating an explosive device and unlawful possession of components for explosives after he detonated {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on}} of Tannerite inside the bed of a dump truck by shooting it with a rifle chambered in [[.50 BMG]] from {{convert|300|yd}} away on January 14, 2008, in [[Red Wing, Minnesota]]. The man was on probation when he mixed and shot the Tannerite and was not allowed to possess firearms or explosives.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hastingsstargazette.com/news/1078101-blast-near-red-wing-brings-felony-charges Blast near Red Wing brings felony charges]" ''Hastings Star Gazette'' January 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdio.com/kstpImages/childs_criminal_complaint.pdf |title=State of Minnesota Criminal Complaint |accessdate=March 17, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222032916/http://www.wdio.com/kstpImages/childs_criminal_complaint.pdf |archive-date=December 22, 2014|last=Barringer |first=Glen |date=January 15, 2008 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 20-year-old man in [[Busti, New York]], shot {{convert|18|lb|abbr=on}} of Tannerite on January 13, 2013, that sent a particularly "loud boom" through much of southern [[Chautauqua County, New York]], and extending as far south as Pennsylvania, at least 3 miles away. Multiple other sounds of explosions were also reported in the incident. The explosive noise caused numerous phone calls to the Chautauqua County Sheriff's Office, the New York State Police, and other law enforcement in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Tichy, "[http://www.post-journal.com/news/page-one/2013/01/boom-caused-by-shooting-explosives-ban-considered-in-county/ Boom Caused By Shooting Explosives; Ban Considered In County]" ''Post Journal'' January 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2016 New York and New Jersey bombings|September 2016 New York and New Jersey bombings]] involved [[improvised explosive device]]s that contained "a compound similar to a commercial explosive known as Tannerite",{{r|NYT3}} set off by a small charge of unstable [[hexamethylene triperoxide diamine]], which served as a [[detonator]]&lt;ref name=NYT3&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/nyregion/nyc-nj-explosions-ahmad-khan-rahami.html Ahmad Khan Rahami Is Arrested in Manhattan and New Jersey Bombings] - The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chemicals-could-be-a-key-in-investigating-the-new-york-and-new-jersey-bombings/ |title=Chemicals Could Be a Key in Investigating the New York and New Jersey Bombings |journal=[[Scientific American]] |first=Larry |last=Greenemeier |date=September 19, 2016 |access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the highly stable [[ammonal]]-type secondary charge.

On April 23, 2017, Dennis Dickey, an off-duty [[U.S. Border Patrol]] agent, shot a Tannerite target in a [[gender reveal]] celebration on state trust land south of [[Tucson, Arizona]], which accidentally ignited the nearby dry brush and started a {{convert|46000|acre|ha|adj=on}} fire known as the [[Sawmill Fire, Arizona|Sawmill Fire]].  At the time, winds were gusting up to {{convert|40|mi|km}} per hour and the [[National Weather Service]] had issued a fire watch in the area. By the time the wildfire was mostly contained one week later, it had jumped over the [[Santa Rita Mountains]] and crossed Arizona Highway 83, spreading into the historic [[Empire Ranch]] and the surrounding {{convert|42000|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Las Cienegas National Conservation Area]]. The estimated damage caused by the blaze was $8.19 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/01/a-border-patrol-agent-threw-a-gender-reveal-party-he-ended-up-starting-a-47000-acre-wildfire/?utm_term=.a2cc53d5b3be |title=Exploding target pegged as trigger for 46,000-acre Sawmill Fire |first=Antonia |last=Noori Farzan |date= October 1, 2018 |newspaper= [[Washington Post]] |access-date=October 1, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickey pleaded guilty in September 2018 to a misdemeanor violation of [[U.S. Forest Service]] regulations and was sentenced to five years' probation.

'''Tetrasulfur tetranitride''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  This gold-poppy coloured solid is the most important binary [[sulfur nitride]], which are compounds that contain only the [[chemical element|elements]] [[sulfur]] and [[nitrogen]]. It is a precursor to many S-N compounds and has attracted wide interest for its unusual structure and bonding.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"&gt;{{ cite book |last1= Greenwood |first1= N. N. |last2= Earnshaw |first2= A. |title= Chemical Elements |edition= 2nd |publisher= Butterworth-Heinemann |location= Boston, MA |year= 1997 |pages= 721–725 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chivers&gt;{{cite book |last= Chivers |first= T. |title= A Guide To Chalcogen-Nitrogen Chemistry |publisher= World Scientific Publishing |location= Singapore |year= 2004 |isbn= 981-256-095-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrogen and sulfur have similar [[electronegativity|electronegativities]]. [[Diagonal relationship|When the properties of atoms are so highly similar]], they often form extensive families of [[covalent]]ly bonded structures and compounds. Indeed, a large number of S-N and S-NH compounds are known with S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as their parent.

==Structure==
S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; adopts an unusual “extreme cradle” structure, with D&lt;sub&gt;2d&lt;/sub&gt; [[symmetry group|point group symmetry]]. It can be viewed as a derivative of a hypothetical eight-membered ring of alternating sulfur and nitrogen atoms.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}  The pairs of sulfur atoms across the ring are separated by 2.586 Å, resulting in a cage-like structure as determined by single crystal X-Ray diffraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sharma |first1= B.

S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has been shown to co-crystallize with [[benzene]] and the [[fullerene|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]] molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Konarev |first1= D.

==Properties==
S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is stable to [[air]]. It is, however, unstable in the [[thermodynamic]] sense with a positive [[enthalpy of formation]] of +460 kJ&amp;nbsp;mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This [[endothermic]] enthalpy of formation originates in the difference in energy of S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compared to its highly stable decomposition products:
:2 S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 4 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
Because one of its decomposition products is a gas, S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can be used as an explosive.&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt; Purer samples tend to be more explosive. Small samples can be detonated by striking with a hammer. S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is [[thermochromic]], changing from pale yellow below −30&amp;nbsp;°C to orange at room temperature to deep red above 100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;

==Synthesis==
{{chem|S|4|N|4}} was first prepared in 1835 by M. Gregory by the reaction of [[disulfur dichloride]] with [[ammonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Jolly | first1 = W.

Tyree Jr }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:6 S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 16 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; →  S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl
Coproducts of this reaction include [[heptasulfur imide]] (S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;NH) and elemental sulfur. A related synthesis employs sulfur monochloride and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl instead:&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;

:4 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + 6 S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 16 HCl + S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;

An alternative synthesis entails the use of [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S as a precursor with pre-formed S&amp;ndash;N bonds. [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is prepared by the reaction of [[lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide]] and [[sulfur dichloride|SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

:2 [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NLi + SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [((CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 2 LiCl

==Acid-base reactions==
[[File:S4N4.BF3-from-xtal-1967-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; serves as a [[Lewis base]] by binding through nitrogen to strongly [[Lewis acid]]ic compounds such as [[Antimony pentachloride|SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Sulfur trioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The cage is distorted in these [[adducts]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;
:S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
:S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The reaction of [Pt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(PMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] with S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is reported to form a complex where a sulfur forms a dative bond to the metal. This compound upon standing is isomerised to a complex in which a nitrogen atom forms the additional bond to the metal centre.

It is protonated by HBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to form a [[tetrafluoroborate]] salt:
:S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + HBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → [S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;BF{{su|b=4|p=−}}]

The soft Lewis acid [[copper(I) chloride|CuCl]] forms a [[coordination polymer]]:&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;

:''n'' S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n'' CuCl  → (S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-μ-(-Cu-Cl-)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

Dilute [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] hydrolyzes S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as follows, yielding [[thiosulfate]] and trithionate:&lt;ref name="Greenwood" /&gt;

:2 S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  6 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  9 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →   S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{su|b=3|p=2−}}  +  2 S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O{{su|b=6|p=2−}}  +  8 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

More concentrated [[base (chemistry)|base]] yields [[sulfite]]:
:S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{su|b=3|p=2−}} + 2 SO{{su|b=3|p=2−}} + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===Metal complexes===
S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with metal complexes.  The cage remains intact in some cases but in other cases, it is degraded.&lt;ref name=Chivers/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kelly |first1= P. F. |last2= Slawin |first2= A. M.

A related [[cation]] is also known, i.e. [S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Treatment with [[Quaternary ammonium cation|tetramethylammonium]] [[azide]] produces the heterocycle [S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;:

In an apparently related reaction, the use of [[bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium chloride|PPN]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives a salt containing the blue [NS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; anion:&lt;ref name="ch7" /&gt;

The anion NS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; has a chain structure described using the resonance [S=S=N–S–S]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ↔ [S–S–N=S=S]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

A '''toothpick''' is a small thin stick of [[wood]], [[plastic]], [[bamboo]], [[metal]], [[bone]] or other substance with at least one and sometimes two sharp ends to insert between [[teeth]] to remove [[detritus]], usually after a [[meal]].  Toothpicks are also used for festive occasions to hold or spear small appetizers (like cheese cubes or [[olive]]s) or as a [[cocktail stick]], and can be decorated with plastic frills or small paper umbrellas or [[flags]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Marketing Genius Who Brought Us the Toothpick." Slate Magazine. N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.slate.com/articles/business_and_tech/design/2007/10/stick_figure.single.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Known in all cultures, the toothpick is not just the oldest instrument for dental cleaning, but predates the arrival of [[early modern humans]], for the skulls of [[Neanderthals]], as well as [[Homo sapiens]], show clear signs of teeth picked with a tool. Toothpicks made of bronze have been found as burial objects in prehistoric graves in Northern Italy and in the East Alps. In 1986, researchers in [[Florida]] discovered the 7500-year-old remains of ancient Native Americans and discovered small grooves between many of the molar teeth.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;(AP) (06/22/1986). "Dentistry as practiced 5510 B.C.". ''Toronto Star''.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the researchers, Justin Martin of Concordia University Wisconsin, said "The enamel on teeth is quite tough, so they must have used the probes quite rigorously to make the grooves."&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

== Materials and Manufacture ==
There are delicate, artistic examples made of silver in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], as well as from [[Pistacia lentiscus|mastic wood]] with the Romans.

In the 17th century, toothpicks were luxury objects and like jewelry, were artfully stylized using precious metal and set with expensive stones.

The first toothpick-manufacturing machine was developed in 1869, by Marc Signorello. Another was patented in 1872, by Silas Noble and J. P. Cooley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/dstartinventions/a/dentistry_2.htm|title=History of the Toothbrush and Toothpaste|author=Mary Bellis|work=About.com Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American wooden toothpicks are cut from [[birch]] wood. Logs are first spiral cut into thin sheets, which are then cut, chopped, milled and bleached (to lighten) into the individual toothpicks.&lt;ref&gt;''[[How It's Made]]: "Toothpicks; acrylic bathtubs; helicopters; beer."  [[The Discovery Channel]].&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic toothpicks, also called dental pics, are still made in America in Georgia, by Armond's Manufacturing.  The Mayo Clinic recommends using a dental pic in lieu of a wooden toothpick to clean one's teeth, as they clean more effectively and one does not risk injuring the gums.
Nowadays other means of dental hygiene are preferred such as [[dental floss]] and [[toothbrush]]es.

In September 2012, Ed Cahill set a world record in Ireland by placing 3,107 toothpicks in his beard in just under three hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness Book Of World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9781908843159|location=|pages=111|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vertebral fixation''' (also known as "spinal fixation") is a [[spinal surgery|orthopedic surgical]] procedure in which two or more [[vertebra]]e are anchored to each other through a synthetic "'''vertebral fixation device'''", with the aim of reducing vertebral mobility and thus avoiding possible damage to the [[spinal cord]] and/or [[nerve root|spinal roots]].

==Indications==
A vertebral fixation procedure may be indicated in cases of [[vertebral fracture]], [[List of vertebral deformities|vertebral deformity]], or degenerative vertebral disorders (such as [[spondylolisthesis]]).

==Vertebral fixation devices==
The device used to achieve vertebral fixation is usually a permanent rigid or semi-rigid [[prosthesis]] made of [[titanium]]; examples include rods, plates, screws, and various combinations thereof. A less common alternative is the use of a resorbable fixation device, composed of a bio-resorbable material.

The medical community uses several different techniques for stabilizing the posterior region of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]].  The most radical of these techniques is [[spinal fusion]].  In recent years/decades spinal [[surgeon]]s have begun to rely more heavily on mechanical implants, which provide increased stability without so severely limiting the recipient’s range of motion.  A number of devices have been developed that allow the recipients near natural range of motion while still providing some support.  In many cases the support offered by such devices is insufficient, leaving the [[physician]] with few other choices than spinal fusion.  

A spinal fixation device stabilizes an area of the [[spine (anatomy)|posterior spine]] while allowing for a significant range of motion and limiting the compression of the affected [[vertebrae]].  The device consists of two or more arm assemblies (lateral) connected by one or more telescopic assemblies (vertical).  Each arm assembly is composed of a central portion, which connects to the telescopic assembly or assemblies. Left and right arms attach to the corresponding side of the central portion of the arm assembly.  Each arm section is directly connected to its individual pedicle by means of pedicle fasteners. 

More information about this specific spinal fixation device can be found in [[The United States Patent Association|The United States Patent Service’s]] November 13, 2007 publication of new patents.  This patent can currently (September 23, 2008) be found on [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7294129.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7294129&amp;RS=PN/7294129 The U.S. Patent Website].&lt;ref&gt;The United States Patent Website&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4190">'''Watap''', '''watape''', '''wattap''', or '''wadab''' ({{IPAc-en|w|ə|ˈ|t|ɑː|p}} or {{IPAc-en|w|æ|ˈ|t|ɑː|p}}) is the [[thread (yarn)|thread]] and [[Rope|cordage]] used by the [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]] and [[First Nations|First Nations peoples of Canada]] to sew together sheets and panels of [[birchbark]].  The word itself comes from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language family, but watap cordage was used and sewn by all of the people who lived where the [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]] tree grows.  The cordage was usually manufactured from the roots of various species of [[conifers]], such as the [[Picea glauca|white spruce]], [[Picea mariana|black spruce]], or [[Thuja occidentalis|Northern whitecedar]], but could originate from a variety of species that sprouted root fibers with sufficient [[tensile strength]] for the required purpose.  In a typical manufacturing process, the roots would be debarked, subjected to a lengthy soaking process, and then [[Steaming|steam]]ed or [[boil]]ed to render them pliable for [[sewing]].  The roots could be left whole and used as cords, or divided into smaller fibers for [[twine]].&lt;ref name="Willow"&gt;Willow, Anna J. Winter 2010. Cultivating Common Ground: Cultural Revitalization in Anishinaabe and Anthropological Discourse. [[American Indian Quarterly]]. Vol 34. No 1. pages 33-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Sewn birchbark panels were employed by the native North Americans of the Upper Great Lakes for a wide variety of purposes; the best-known, and one which required among the highest degree of craftsmanship, was the manufacture of light [[canoe]]s.  Panels of bark, sewn together with watap and [[caulk]]ed with tree resin, could be used to create a vessel that would resist leakage to the point of being almost waterproof.&lt;ref name="Willow"/&gt;  The watap could also be used as part of the joinery for the structural elements of the canoe.&lt;ref&gt;Birk, Douglas A.  March 1975.  Recent underwater recoveries at Fort Charlotte, Grand Portage National Monument, Minnesota.  International Journal of Nautical Archeology.  Vol 4. No 1. pages 73-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watap-sewn bark sheets and panels could also be used to make vessels and utensils for food storage and other household use.  Examples of this packaging were called ''[[Wiigwaasi-makak|wiigwaasi-makakoon]]'', and the watap stitchery was often used as an element in the decoration and unique identity of the package.  The peoples initiated into the heritage of the [[Midewiwin]], or ''Great Medicine Society'', kept records and aids to memory through [[Wiigwaasabak|birchbark scrolls]] sewn together with watap.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, Kenneth E. 1965. Birch-bark Scrolls in Archaeological Contexts. [[American Antiquity]]. Vol 30. No 4. page 480.&lt;/ref&gt;
       
==Linguistic heritage==
The word "watap" entered European languages through [[Canadian French]], and ultimately derives from the [[Cree language|Cree]] word ''watapiy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|Watap|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wide use of the term in Cree indicates the importance of birchbark craft to that nation and the widespread presence of the paper birch and spruce in their historical homeland.  The [[Anishinaabe]] peoples also extensively harvested and manufactured watap.&lt;ref name="Willow"/&gt;

==Geography==
''Watap Lake'', also called ''Watape Lake'', and the adjacent ''Watap Portage'' are key elements in the [[Grand Portage National Monument|Grand Portage]] from [[Lake Superior]] to the interior of [[North America]].  The lake and portage were of such historical importance that the boundary between [[Canada]] and the [[United States of America]] follows the length of the lake and portage today.

''Watab River'' in [[Stearns County, Minnesota]], served as a boundary separating the [[Sioux#Linguistics|Dakota]] peoples from the [[Ojibwa]] people per the 1825 [[First Treaty of Prairie du Chien]].
