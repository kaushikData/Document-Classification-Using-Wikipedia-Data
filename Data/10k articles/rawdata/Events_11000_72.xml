[[File:1906 Dundee Fire postcard.jpg|thumb|A hand-coloured postcard depicting the fire.]]
In July 1906, the city of [[Dundee]] was the site of a large fire caused by the ignition of a [[bonded warehouse]]. The fire, which burned for 12 hours, has been described as the most destructive fire in the history of Dundee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bygone.dundeecity.gov.uk/bygone-news/july-1906|title=July 1906 - Bygone Dundee: Dundee's Greatest Fire|publisher=Dundee City Council|accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire was described by an eyewitness as sending "rivers of burning [[whisky]]" through the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/Community/Heritage-and-History/article/10726/dundee-fire-postcard-tells-the-1906-tale-of-rivers-of-burning-whisky.html|title=Dundee fire postcard tells the 1906 tale of 'rivers of burning whisky'|accessdate=2011-02-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214015001/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/Community/Heritage-and-History/article/10726/dundee-fire-postcard-tells-the-1906-tale-of-rivers-of-burning-whisky.html|archivedate=14 February 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
James Watson and Co. were wholesale whisky merchants whose premises occupied a large site in Dundee on the corner of Trades Lane and Seagate. In 1906 about 300 people were employed by the firm.&lt;ref name="Lost Dundee"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKean|first=Charles, and Whatley, Patricia, with Baxter, Kenneth|title=Lost Dundee. Dundee's Lost Architectural Heritage|year=2008|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9781841585628|pages=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson and Co. were based at 97 Seagate with Customs Bond No. 4 next door at 99 Seagate.&lt;ref name=Address&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dundee Directory 1906-1907|year=1906|publisher=James P. Mathew &amp; Co|location=Dundee|page=633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fire==
An employee of James Watson &amp; Co. was passing the building on the evening of 19 July 1906 when he noticed smoke emerging from its roof. The building was soon ablaze and large vats of whisky caught fire and exploded, leading to flaming alcohol raining down on surrounding streets and buildings. The fire quickly spread to other buildings. The premises of another whisky merchant in nearby Candle Lane were also destroyed.  So bad was the inferno that firefighters had to be called from [[Edinburgh]] to help fight it.&lt;ref name="Lost Dundee"/&gt;

The fire attracted thousands of spectators who gathered to watch the blaze and the sight of 'rivers of blue-falmed whiskey flowing into street drains'.&lt;ref name="Brochtie&amp;Herd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brochtie|first1=Alan|last2=Herd|first2=Jack|title=Wheels Around Dundee|date=2002|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Ayrshire|isbn=978-1840332100|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
At the time of the fire it was estimated that £450,000 worth of damage had been caused.&lt;ref name="Lost Dundee"/&gt; The following year's Dundee Directory reported that the fire had 'desolated a large portion of the neighbourhood' around Seagate, Trades Lane and Candle Lane, and that as a result a large area for building operations had opened up.&lt;ref name="General Notice"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dundee Directory 1907-1908|year=1907|publisher=James P. Mathew &amp; Co|location=Dundee|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; New bonds designed by David Baxter were built on the site in 1907 and are now listed buildings. Whisky blending at Watson's Bond ceased in 1981 and the bonds closed in 1987.&lt;ref name="British Listed Buildings"&gt;{{cite web|title=2, 4 Candle Lane and 99 Seagate and 25-37 (odd Nos) Trades Lane, Watson's Bond, Hm Customs Warehouse, Dundee|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-25194-2-4-candle-lane-and-99-seagate-and-25-37-|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5691">The '''Portsmouth South by-election''' was held on 14 June 1984, following the death of [[Bonner Pink]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Portsmouth South (UK Parliament constituency)|Portsmouth South]].

Portsmouth South was considered a [[safe seat]] for the Conservatives.  Pink had held the constituency since the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966 general election]], while the party had held the seat since its creation in [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918]].  At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], Pink had taken just over half the votes cast.&lt;ref name="keele"&gt;[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge83/i16.htm UK General Election results: June 1983]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Candidates==
The Conservatives stood [[Patrick Rock]].&lt;ref name="portsmouth84"&gt;[http://by-elections.co.uk/portsmouth84.html Portsmouth South 1984] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821060042/http://www.by-elections.co.uk/portsmouth84.html |date=2009-08-21 }}, British Parliamentary ByElections&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) had narrowly taken second place in the constituency in 1983, with just over one quarter of the vote.&lt;ref name="keele" /&gt;  They stood [[Mike Hancock (UK politician)|Mike Hancock]], an engineer and member of [[Hampshire County Council]], who had been their unsuccessful candidate in 1983.

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had been pushed into third place in 1983, taking 22% of the vote.&lt;ref name="keele" /&gt;  They also re-stood their candidate from the previous year, Sally Thomas, a supporter of unilateral [[nuclear disarmament]].  As Portsmouth South was the headquarters of the [[Royal Navy]], this was a significant issue in the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Cook and John Ramsden, ''By-Elections in British Politics''&lt;/ref&gt;

Three other candidates had stood in the general election,&lt;ref name="keele" /&gt; and two of these stood in the by-election: Gordon Knight of the [[far right]] [[National Front (UK)|National Front]], and Alan Evens who stood as "Liberal for Unilateral Nuclear Disarmament", while four new candidate completed the field.  Terry Mitchell stood for the [[Ecology Party]], Thomas Layton stood as "Spare the Earth - Ecology", Anthony Andrews stood as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] with the slogan "Vote Education: Save Schools &amp; Colleges", and Pete Smith stood for the New National Party.&lt;ref name="portsmouth84" /&gt;

==Result==
The SDP unexpectedly gained the seat.  The Conservative vote fell sharply, while Labour saw only a small increase.  None of the other candidates were able to take 1% of the votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/by1983.html|title=Results of Byelections in the 1983-87 Parliament|last=Boothroyd|first=David|access-date=2015-09-19|website=United Kingdom Election Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hancock lost the seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], but was able to retake it in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]].

The '''2012 Sabha conflict''' started in the [[aftermath of the Libyan civil war]], and involved armed clashes between the [[Tubu people|Tubu]] and [[Abu Seif]] tribes in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], a city of almost 100,000&lt;ref name=gazeteer&gt;{{cite web|last=[[World Gazetteer]] |url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1273372850&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;des=gamelan&amp;geo=-133&amp;srt=dpnn&amp;col=abcdefghimoq&amp;msz=1500&amp;pt=c&amp;va=&amp;srt=pdnn |title=Libya: largest cities and towns and statistics of their population |accessdate=15 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614003537/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1273372850&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;des=gamelan&amp;geo=-133&amp;srt=dpnn&amp;col=abcdefghimoq&amp;msz=1500&amp;pt=c&amp;va=&amp;srt=pdnn |archivedate=14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the region of [[Fezzan]], Libya. It happened after [[2012 Kufra conflict|February 2012 clashes in Kufra]], that involved the Tubu people, too. On 27 March, [[Jomode Elie Getty]] charged the clashes as "genocide". A Paris-based Tabu official, [[Jomode Elie Getty]], who was an official with the NTC but resigned on Tuesday, accused the NTC of siding with Arabs in attacks on Tabu tribesmen. He called for U.N. intervention.

Issa Abdel Majit Monsur,the head of the Tubu tribe in Libya, announced the reactivation of the "[[Toubou Front for the Salvation of Libya]]", an opposition group that was already active during the [[history of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|rule of]] [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. He also announced the possibility of separatist activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/03/27/203567.html?PHPSESSID=pbj03cfmtteu3cov7jekmq3nh7 |title=Libya’s Toubou tribal leader raises separatist bid |work=Al Arabiya|date=27 March 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ceasefire was announced, and as of 1 April the violence had stopped.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATE 2-Libyan PM visits scene of tribal clashes in desert|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/01/libya-clashes-idUSL6E8F10ST20120401|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
Late on 25 March, clashes erupted in the southern city of Sabha, between Libyan government militia in the city and Tubu tribesman, after a man from the Abu Seif tribe was killed in a dispute over a car by the Tubu. The fighting was, at first, mainly on the city outskirts. However, it then spread to the city's main streets and black plumes of smoke could be seen rising from Sabha's airport on 26 March. Initially seven people were reportedly killed and another seven wounded. However, later reports put the death toll at 20 with another 40 people wounded. The Tubu stated that the Abu Seif attacked their negotiation team outside a government building while they were en route to talk about reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shalchi |first=Hadeel Al |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/03/26/libya-tribes-clashes-idINDEE82P0IV20120326 |title=Tribal clashes in southern Libya kill 7|work=Reuters India|agency=Reuters |date=27 March 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iS7sPT0VFR9zUH5ynWa6hSO-zG2w?docId=b93dc517a9314395821a008ed5040ecd |title=AP Interview: Libya's leader admits instability |work=Google News|agency=Associated Press |date=27 March 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/03/26/203379.html |title=More than 10 people killed in tribal clashes in Libya’s south |work=Al Arabiya|date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March, the fighting in Sabha continued and the toll was reported to had reached 49 dead, with 15 of the killed being from the Tubu and the rest from Abu Seif. Tubu militiamen had reportedly advanced into the center of the city and their snipers had taken up positions, inflicting a number of casualties.&lt;ref name=kill50/&gt;

On 28 March, the fighting briefly eased off with reports of a ceasefire, but quickly escalated again. By the end of the day the toll had reached more than 70 dead and 150 wounded, 40 of the dead being from the Tubu.&lt;ref name=70killed/&gt;

On 30 March, ceasefire was negotiated between the Council of Elders of Libya, Sabha local council and members of the Misrata militia in the southern city. According to it, Tubu tribesmen are to withdraw from all areas and recognize the authority of the national army which would take control of all security operations in the south and on the borders. In return, the Tubu will be returned all property in Libya and there will be an investigation into the conflict. Moreover, local militias would be integrated into either Army or Ministry of Interior forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/fresh-sebha-ceasefire-agreement/ |title=Fresh Sebha ceasefire agreement |work=Libya Herald |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fighting re-ignited the next day once again.

On 31 March, the Tubus, after being pushed back south of the city, launched a counter-attack in a bid to re-enter the town. 16 people were killed, eight from each side, and more than 50 wounded.&lt;ref name=kill16/&gt; The Libyan health minister announced that 147 people had been killed and 395 wounded, up to the night before, since the start of the fighting in Sabha.&lt;ref name=over150/&gt; Later that day, colonel Wanis Bu Khamadh, commander in charge of army units inside the city, said that despite the clashes, the army was able to extend its area of control throughout most of the city and area south of the Sabha. He also claimed that situation de-escalated and army was making a push in order to take under its direct control the whole [[Fezzan]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/sebha-now-safe-but-147-killed-during-clashes-says-government/ |title=Sebha now safe but 147 killed during clashes says government |work=Libya Herald |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April, Libyan Prime Minister [[Abdurrahim El-Keib]] has visited area and confirmed that fragile peace was so far holding. Meanwhile, [[National Transitional Council]] president [[Mustafa Abdul Jalil]] declared southern region encompassing cities Wadi al Shatii, Sabha, Ubari, Ghat, and Murzuq military zone where military commander, under which authority falls all armed forces in the region, was appointed by Ministry of Defence instead of regional military councils. The [[National Liberation Army (Libya)|National Liberation Army]] and Ministry of Interior forces dispatched 2,000 soldiers and border guards to region with [[Free Libyan Air Force]] patrolling over the area. Meanwhile, the [[National Liberation Army (Libya)|National Liberation Army]] was able to secure all areas of Sabha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/al-kub-visits-sebha/ |title=Al-Kib visits Sebha |work=Libya Herald |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; El-Keib said "every Libyan is important to us. We're going to take care of them like we do take care of any other Libyan, like our brothers and sisters."&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

Despite the deployment of 2,000 soldiers under the command of [[Wanis Bukhamada]] in March, violence has continued, with Bukhamada's home in Benghazi even coming under attack in early September. On 14 September further clashes between the Tebu and a local Arab tribe left 2 head, and on 17 September there was an attempted assassination against Col. [[Ali Dallah Gaidi]], the Head of Sebha Military Council. Gaidi's wife was killed in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/?p=14811 |title=Sebha GNC member wants local military commanders sacked |agency=Libya Herald |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was not a Kuwaiti, but rather was an ethnic [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] and a [[Pakistani citizen]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; He adopted the last name ''Al-Kuwaiti'' because his Pakistani parents lived in [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|title=Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed, Osama Bin Laden's Associate And Trusted Confidante, Identified: NATO|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/02/ibrahim-saeed-ahmed-osama-bin-ladens-associat_n_870285.html |quote=The captives said the courier was known by the nom de guerre Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, which he adopted because their parents lived in Kuwait.|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to secret documents, he was one of the few men bin Laden completely trusted and was said to be his "favorite courier and right-hand man".&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; He sheltered and lived with bin Laden for a number of years and [[Death of Osama bin Laden|was killed along with him]] by [[SEAL Team Six|The U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] on May 2, 2011.

==2000s==
Al-Kuwaiti was a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], an ethnic Afghan background who was born and grew up in Kuwait and spoke [[Pashto language|Pashto]] (in a cultivated, urban accent)&lt;ref name=telegraph2 /&gt; and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name=Isikoff4/&gt; He was a ''protégé'' of [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] and had reportedly given computer training in [[Karachi]] to the perpetrators of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]].&lt;ref name=msnbc1 /&gt; He was implicated in the attacks and was contacted in the aftermath by [[Riduan Isamuddin|Riduan "Hambali" Isamuddin]]. Al-Kuwaiti provided a safe haven to Isamuddin and several of his close associates in his home in a quiet residential neighborhood of [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name="Conboy2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Conboy|first=Kenneth J.|title=The second front: inside Asia's most dangerous terrorist network |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-JlKtzgo81QC&amp;pg=PA151 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |year=2006 |publisher=[[Equinox Publishing (Jakarta)|Equinox Publishing]]|isbn=978-979-3780-09-2|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guantanamo Bay documents dated 16 January 2008 revealed that [[Mohamedou Ould Salahi]] had claimed that Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti was wounded while fleeing [[Tora Bora]] after the [[Battle of Tora Bora]] in December 2001 and had later died from his arm injuries.&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt; The document claimed he was a mid-level al-Qaeda operative who facilitated the movement and safe haven of senior al-Qaeda members and families. As a speaker of Arabic and Pashto he could communicate and move easily among both the Arab members of al-Qaeda and the Pashtun tribesmen of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Isikoff4&gt;{{cite news |title=How profile of bin Laden courier led CIA to its target |first=Michael |last=Isikoff |authorlink=Michael Isikoff |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/42906157/ns/world_news-death_of_bin_laden/ |newspaper=[[TODAY News]] |date=4 May 2011 |accessdate=7 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508151719/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/42906157/ns/world_news-death_of_bin_laden |archivedate=8 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contradicting the claims by Salahi that al-Kuwaiti had died in December 2001, in 2007 U.S. officials discovered the courier's real name and, in 2009, that he lived in [[Abbottabad]], Pakistan. These findings were based on information collected from [[Guantánamo Bay]] detainees, notably [[Hassan Gul]] in 2004. From Gul, the United States intelligence learned that al-Kuwaiti was also close to Mohammed's successor [[Abu Faraj al-Libi]].  Gul further revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, a fact which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with Bin Laden. 
[[File:Osama bin Laden compound1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View of [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|the compound]]]]
He was reportedly tracked from [[Peshawar]] by Pakistanis working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. "The [[National Security Agency]] reportedly tracked phone calls between the courier Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's relatives in the Persian Gulf to all numbers in Pakistan, and NSA surveillance eventually tracked Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's location in Pakistan via one such phone call", the AP writes.

"In August 2010 they tracked al-Kuwaiti as he drove from Peshawar to [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|a residence in Abbottabad]] – and as analysts inventoried the compound's striking security features they became convinced that it housed a high-level al-Qaeda figure."&lt;ref name=EnvoyRozen&gt;{{cite web |last=Rozen |first=Laura |title=The courier: the multiple identities of the man who led U.S. to bin Laden |url= https://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_theenvoy/20110504/ts_yblog_theenvoy/the-courier-the-multiple-identities-of-the-man-who-led-u-s-to-bin-laden |work=The Envoy |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |date=4 May 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110519163918/http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_theenvoy/20110504/ts_yblog_theenvoy/the-courier-the-multiple-identities-of-the-man-who-led-u-s-to-bin-laden| archivedate= 19 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Osama bin Laden hideout-en.svg|thumb|right|Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|Compound where al-Kuwaiti hid Osama bin Laden and his family]]

==2010s==
Using satellite photos and intelligence reports, the CIA sought to identify the inhabitants of the fortified compound in Abbottabad. In September 2010, the CIA concluded that the compound was "custom built to hide someone of significance" and that it was very likely that Osama bin Laden was residing there.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=msnbc2 /&gt; Al-Kuwaiti was said to be one of the two tall fair-skinned bearded men who claimed to be ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]s and were known in the community to be living at the house and occasionally attended local funerals.

He went locally by the name Arshad Khan, and his brother (or cousin as some neighbors thought) went by the name Tareq Khan. They claimed to be from a village near the town of [[Charsadda]] some people believe he was from Shangla (Khakhtagatta area), Charsadda lies about 180 kilometres to the west, while Shangla is situated on northern side 190 kilometres from Abbottabad in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (old name-NWFP) province, and to have obtained their wealth from a family-owned hotel in Dubai. He also claimed that because of  his occupation as a money changer, he needed high walls to keep out enemies he had encountered in his profession.&lt;ref name=npr /&gt; He was described as "a friendly man from the tribal-areas".&lt;ref name=npr /&gt;

==Death==
At the time Osama bin Laden was in the top of most wanted in the US. Kuwaiti along with Bin Laden was killed during the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|raid on the compound]] by a [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] team on 2 May 2011.&lt;ref name=npr /&gt;

'''Albion Mills''' was a [[steam engine|steam-powered]] [[gristmill|flour mill]] situated on the southeastern side of [[Blackfriars Bridge]] in northern [[Southwark]], London, then in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name="Mechanics"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mechanics' Magazine, Museum, Register, Journal, and Gazette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rggAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA155|year=1843|publisher=M. Salmon|volume=38|issue=1013|edition=Public domain|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Boulton]] began plans for the mill as early as 1783;{{sfn|Smiles|1865|p=353}} it was completed in 1786, and gutted by fire in 1791.  Most of the notable engineering drawings and depictions of Albion Mills are in the [[Birmingham Central Library]].

==Facility==
[[File:Double-acting engine at Albion Mills.png|left|thumb|Double-acting engine at Albion Mills]]
The building was designed by the architect [[Samuel Wyatt]].{{sfn|Smiles|1865|p = 353}} The engines were supplied with water taken directly from the [[River Thames]].&lt;ref name="portcities" /&gt; At the time, they were "the most complete and powerful which had been produced by the [[Soho Manufactory]]".  The mill's wheels and shafts were made of iron. An exception to this were some of the [[Gear|cogs]], which were of hard wood, though others were of [[cast iron]], as were the [[pinion]]s. The teeth, some of wood and others of iron, were manufactured by chipping and filing into [[epicycloid]]al shapes. The shafts and axles were made of iron and the bearings of [[brass]].{{sfn|Smiles|1874|p = 227}} The mill's double engine, producing {{convert|50|hp}}, drove 20 pairs of [[millstone]]s, each grinding some nine bushels of corn an hour.&lt;ref name="VCS" /&gt; It also provided power for raising corn, fanning it to free it of impurities, sifting it, dressing the meal and lowering it into the barges, which made the process more efficient.{{sfn|Smiles|1874|p = 227}}

The mill was built in 1786 by Matthew Boulton,&lt;ref name="portcities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.104/chapterId/2274/Flour-milling-and-the-port.html|title=Flour milling and the port|publisher=Portcities.org.uk|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the backing of City financiers and [[Joah Bates]], an organ player and composer who "embarked all his own money and 10,000/ belonging to his wife" to build it.&lt;ref name="VCS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vauxhallcivicsociety.org.uk/history/albion-mill/|title=Albion Mill|publisher=Vauxhall Civic Society|accessdate=9 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018073918/http://www.vauxhallcivicsociety.org.uk/history/albion-mill/|archive-date=18 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rose|Rose|Wright|1841|p=345}} It was the first steam-powered commercial flour mill in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Reynolds|1974|p=55}} [[James Watt]], an associate of Boulton, was personally hired to build a steam engine for the mill to grind corn.&lt;ref name="Mechanics" /&gt; Watt's engine was tested before numerous spectators, including Sir [[Joseph Banks]], but encountered problems with the [[sun and planet gear]], and the piston rods. Repairs were completed in April 1786. The cost of erecting the mill proved to be considerably in excess of the original estimate, and Watt soon feared that it would turn out to be a losing concern. He had no doubt that the engines or the machinery would be able to do all that had been promised; but he feared that the absence of business capacity on the part of the managers would be fatal to the mill's commercial success.{{sfn|Smiles|1865|p=357}} In September 1786, the [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke of Milan]] visited the mills.&lt;ref name=Times140986&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=London |day_of_week=Thursday |date=14 September 1786 |page_number=2 |issue=529 |column=A, B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1789, a second engine had been installed.&lt;ref name="VCS"/&gt; The business thrived, and by June 1790 the mill was producing sales of £6,800 in flour a week.&lt;ref name="VCS"/&gt; However, problems remained with its running and maintenance, and Boulton was dissatisfied with the results.&lt;ref name="VCS"/&gt;

===Fire===
At 06:30 on 2 March 1791,&lt;ref name=Times030391/&gt; a fire gutted the building, devastating Bates financially.{{sfn|Rose|Rose|Wright|1841|p=345}} The building was completely gutted within two hours. Several houses near the mills were also burnt down. Damage was estimated at [[Pound Sterling|£150,000]]. Over 500 people became unemployed.&lt;ref name=Times030391&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Albion Mills Destroyed by Fire |day_of_week=Thursday |date=3 March 1791 |page_number=3 |issue=1942 |column=A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arson was strongly suspected, but Rennie and Wyatt, the manager of the mill, blamed a lack of grease on a corn machine in front of the kiln, and called the fire an accident.&lt;ref name="VCS"/&gt; In response to the loss of the Albion Mills, the proprietors of mills at [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]], [[Limehouse]] and [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], [[Middlesex]] and [[Rotherhithe]], Surrey restarted business, their mills having been idle for more than three years.&lt;ref name=Times050391&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=(untitled) |day_of_week=Saturday |date=5 March 1791 |page_number=3 |issue=1944 |column=C }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The gutting of the mill and the end of a period during which the Albion Mills Company held a virtual monopoly on the London flour market was warmly received by some rivals in London, particularly when plans to build a new engine and mill were eventually rejected and the old mill was converted into houses.&lt;ref name="VCS"/&gt; According to [[Graham Gibberd]], the Albion Mills building became "London's symbol for the impending industrial revolution", and the shell of the building was the inspiration for [[William Blake]]'s "dark satanic mills" in his poem ''[[And did those feet in ancient time#"Dark Satanic Mills"|And did those feet in ancient time]]''.&lt;ref name="VCS"/&gt; Most of the notable engineering drawings and depictions of the Albion Mills are in the [[Boulton and Watt|Boulton &amp; Watt Archive]] of Birmingham Central Library.&lt;ref name="VCS"/&gt;

'''''Allegiance''''' is a musical with music and lyrics by Jay Kuo and a book by [[Marc Acito]], Kuo and Lorenzo Thione. The story, set during the [[Japanese American internment]] of [[World War II]] (with a [[framing story]] set in the present day), was inspired by the personal experiences of [[George Takei]], who stars in the musical. It follows the Kimura family in the years following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], as they are forced to leave their farm in [[Salinas, California]] and are sent to the [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center|Heart Mountain internment camp]] in the rural plains of [[Wyoming]].

The musical began development in 2008 and premiered in September 2012 in [[San Diego]], California. It played on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] from October 2015 to February 2016.&lt;ref name=Closing1/&gt; Reviews on Broadway were mixed, although the cast was generally praised.&lt;ref name=BWWRoundup/&gt;

==Conception and historical perspective==
In the fall of 2008, [[George Takei]] and his husband, Brad, were coincidentally seated next to Jay Kuo and Lorenzo Thione at an [[Off-Broadway]] show, where a brief conversation revealed a mutual love of theater.  The next day, the four were once again seated together at a Broadway show, ''[[In the Heights]]''.  At intermission, Kuo and Thione approached Takei, curious as to why he had been so emotionally affected by the father's song ("Useless") in which he laments his inability to help his family. Over the course of that intermission, Takei recounted his personal experience as a child in a [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese internment camp]], during World War II, and his own father's sense of helplessness at his inability to protect his family that was mirrored in the song. Kuo and Thione felt that Takei's family's experience would make a great show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/jul/18/allegiance-pledges-to-make-it-to-broadway/ "''Allegiance'' pledges to make it to Broadway"], UTSanDiego.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allegiancemusical.com/post/creators Creators] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915083812/http://www.allegiancemusical.com/post/creators |date=2012-09-15 }}, Allegiancemusical.com, July 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Although previous major Broadway musicals have involved Asian and Asian-American topics or settings, including three of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s shows, ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' and ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', ''Allegiance'' is "the first [Broadway] musical created by Asian Americans, directed by an Asian American ... with a predominantly Asian cast ... [and] an Asian-American viewpoint informing the work".&lt;ref&gt;Tran, Diep. [http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/10/27/from-orientalism-to-authenticity-broadways-yellow-fever/ "From Orientalism to Authenticity: Broadway’s Yellow Fever"], ''[[Theatre Communications Group|American Theatre]]'' magazine, October 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the musical takes some liberties with history. According to Frank Abe, the creator of the documentary film ''Conscience and the Constitution'', the musical "conflate[s] [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center|Heart Mountain]] with the worst of the [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument#Tule Lake Segregation Center|segregation center at Tule Lake]] and invent[s] military rule at Heart Mountain."&lt;ref name=Nichi&gt;Abe, Frank. [http://www.nichibei.org/2015/11/allegiance-uplifts-by-doctoring-japanese-american-history/ "''Allegiance'' uplifts by doctoring Japanese American history"], ''Nichi Bei Weekly'', November 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The processing of new arrivals is embellished for dramatic effect, as handcuffs and physical abuse by military police was not reported in the internment camps. Abe comments that the resistance by the [[Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee]] was a studied act of civil disobedience, not a gang of "fists-raised revolutionaries". He notes: "No firearms were used inside the [camps'] perimeter. The resistance was open and above-board, its meetings open to the public. No one had to run or hide; leaders of the Fair Play Committee were quietly taken into custody at their family barracks. ... The resisters knew they risked five years in prison for bucking the draft, but violating the Selective Service Act was never a capital crime, never treason. No resistance leader at Heart Mountain was beaten bloody or hunted by guards", draft cards were not burned, and no newspaper articles affected the internment; notably Frankie would not have been taken to the infirmary by military police, which causes the key conflict in the show.&lt;ref name=Nichi/&gt; Abe objects to the portrayal of the activities and treatment of the resisters, and to the "relentless optimism" of the score, concluding that the show distorts the historical lesson, diminishes the real impact of "the anger and suppressed rage" that the internees carried from the internment camps, and "risks supplanting the truth of the resistance and the Japanese American experience in the popular mind [and] cheapens the fabric of basic reality to achieve [commercial] ends."&lt;ref name=Nichi/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
An aged World War II veteran, Sam Kimura, prepares for a [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] anniversary ceremony. A woman arrives to inform him that his estranged sister Kei has died, and that she is Kei's executor. She gives Sam an envelope and tells him that the funeral is to be held later that afternoon. Angered by the opening of his old family wounds after nearly 60 years of estrangement, he berates his once-beloved sister for not leaving him in peace. Kei's ghost informs Sam that she couldn't rest in peace without making one last attempt to reconnect with him.

It is 1941, and Sammy is a newly elected class president who dreams of "Going Places", like college and high political office. His widower father Tatsuo, and grandfather Ojii-chan, own a farm in [[Salinas, California|Salinas]], California. Sammy adores his older sister Kei, who has postponed her own dreams to help raise him. Tatsuo is always pushing Sammy to be better and reach his potential. Sammy believes that Tatsuo blames Sammy for his wife's death in childbirth. After the Japanese sneak [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December, the US government fears that Japanese-Americans might be loyal to the [[Empire of Japan]]. The Japanese-Americans in the Western US are [[Internment of Japanese Americans|incarcerated in internment camps]]. Sammy's family is forced to sell their beautiful farm for a small price and sent to the bleak [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center]] in Wyoming.
 	
While in this camp, and against his father's wishes, Sammy joins with [[Mike Masaoka]], head of the [[Japanese American Citizens League]], which cooperates with the authorities to identify "disloyal" Japanese. When his grandfather, Ojii-chan, becomes sick, Sammy goes to see the white Quaker volunteer nurse at the camp, Hannah, for some cough syrup.  She tells him it is only for the staff, but Sammy is persuasive, and she gives him the medication. The two begin a relationship that causes additional tensions, because [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|interracial marriage]] with Hannah would be illegal. Tatsuo is not inclined to cooperate. He is sent to a brutal prison for refusing to swear his allegiance by answering "yes" on an [[Internment of Japanese Americans#Loyalty questions and segregation|unjustly-worded loyalty questionnaire]]. Sammy's sister Kei falls in love with a [[Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee|draft resistance leader]], Frankie Suzuki, and she also joins the resisters advocating for the rights of her people.

===Act II===
Masaoka manages to obtain Washington's permission for the Japanese-Americans to enlist in US armed forces, but only if they take on the most dangerous assignments in the war in Italy. Eager to prove his loyalty, Sammy enlists in the [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]], a US Army unit consisting of American-born sons of Japanese immigrants, and he fights bravely in Europe. He leads fellow [[Nisei]] on a [[Lost_Battalion_(Europe,_World_War_II)|suicide mission]], in which the majority of the soldiers are killed. While in prison, Tatsuo is given a copy of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine that trumpets Sammy's bravery in combat, and is told that he was only let out of his cell because of his son's actions.

Meanwhile, Kei and Frankie, who are still in love, help lead the resistance. Eventually, Frankie's scuffles with a military policeman lead to Hannah's accidental and fatal shooting. Grandpa Ojii-chan, who has managed to grow a crop of vegetables in the mountain's rough terrain, dies peacefully while in his garden. After the war, Sammy learns that Frankie and Kei, now married, have a daughter named Hanako (after nurse Hannah). Aghast at this, he confronts Tatsuo, saying that Frankie was the son he always wanted. Already furious at Kei and Frankie, he learns of Hannah's death at Heart Mountain and blames Kei and Frankie. He then walks away from his family for a job in Washington that Masaoka had offered him after discharge. Kei argues with Sammy, calling him a coward for leaving his family. She tries to stop him, but only manages to tear the [[Purple Heart]] off of his uniform.

Back in the present day, Sam opens the envelope and finds a posthumous bequest from Kei: the ''Life'' magazine featuring Sammy's exploits that Tatsuo had kept since his release from prison. Sam attends Kei's funeral, and Kei's executor thanks him for attending. The executor then says that her mother wanted to give Sam something else, and she hands him his old Purple Heart medal.  He then realizes that the executor is his niece Hanako. He breaks down, aware that he has a chance to forgive and to share in the love and compassion of his family.

''Allegiance'' had its first reading at the [[Japanese American National Museum]] on July 13, 2009 starring George Takei, [[Lea Salonga]] and others. It was followed by two more readings that were held in New York in 2010 with the same two, but this time with [[Telly Leung]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.

==Reception==

===Critical reaction===
For the Old Globe production in 2012, critics felt the subject was important but the show required better execution. Writing for the ''Los Angeles Times'', Anne Marie Welsh concluded the "show needs a sharper emotional focus and musical edge to match its bold subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/20/entertainment/la-et-cm-old-globe-review-20120921 |title=Theater review: 'Allegiance' gives Japanese internment a soft focus |author=Welsh, Anne Marie |date=20 September 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the ''San Diego Reader'', critic Jeff Smith wrote "Right now, ''Allegiance'' is, at best, an 'important' musical. But it needs a great deal of rethinking and reshaping to become a good one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2012/sep/26/theater-allegiance-important-musical-old-globe/ |title=''Allegiance'', an important musical at the Old Globe |author=Smith, Jeff |date=26 September 2012 |newspaper=San Diego Reader |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reception for the Broadway production was mixed. While the cast was often praised, especially Takei's characterization and Salonga's singing, the reviews frequently criticized poor execution of a worthy subject, especially the lyrics.&lt;ref name=BWWRoundup&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Review-Roundup-George-Takei-Lea-Salonga-Telly-Leung-on-Broadway-in-ALLEGIANCE-20151109 "Review Roundup: George Takei, Lea Salonga, Telly Leung on Broadway in ''Allegiance''"], BroadwayWorld.com, November 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYRoundup&gt;Sheward, David.

He liked some of the 1940s style songs but said of the ballads that "none of the melodies linger once the curtain has fallen and the lyrics pile on platitude and cliché."&lt;ref&gt;Soloski, Alexis.

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s review singled out Takei's performance as "providing much-needed islands of levity amidst a sea of sadness. ... Allegiance is an important show with a phenomenal cast, and it deserves to be seen."&lt;ref&gt;Biedenharn, Isabella. [http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/07/allegiance-ew-stage-review "Allegiance: EW stage review"], ''Entertainment Weekly'', November 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rex Reed]], in ''[[The New York Observer]]'' praised the book, score and direction, writing: "The [finale] brought tears to my eyes. The audience is overwhelmed. The screams are voluminous.

At its best, “Allegiance” gracefully shapes dramatic and historical contours into an epic that – in the spirit of ''gaman'' – coaxes a fierce beauty from once-poisoned soil."&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, James.

[but] if you can make a critic who sneered in the first act leave the theater a little teary-eyed, you're probably doing something right."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Elysa.

Validation is hardly the worst crime a show can commit, and I think that’s one reason the audience was cheering at the very moving end of the show. It’s a triumph of a rare sort, shedding light in a dark corner of our history with uncommon generosity of spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Gerard, Jeremy.

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', however, [[Charles Isherwood]] praised the performers but wrote: "The show wants to illuminate a dark passage in American history with complexity and honesty, but the first requirement of any Broadway musical is to entertain. While well-intentioned and polished, ''Allegiance'' struggles to balance both ambitions, and doesn’t always find an equilibrium."&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, Charles.

'''''Anna and the King''''' is a 1999 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|period drama film]] directed by [[Andy Tennant]], from a screenplay written by [[Steve Meerson]] and [[Peter Krikes]]. Loosely based on the 1944 novel ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (book)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'', which give a [[Anna Leonowens#Royal governess|fictionalized account]] of the diaries of [[Anna Leonowens]], it stars [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Chow Yun-fat]] in the titular roles.

The story concerns Anna Leonowens, an English school teacher in [[Thailand|Siam]], in the late 19th century, who becomes the teacher of [[King Mongkut]]'s many children and wives. It was mostly shot in [[Malaysia]], particularly in the [[Penang]], [[Ipoh]] and [[Langkawi]] region. 

''Anna and the King'' was released in the [[United States]] on December 17, 1999 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film was subject to controversy when the Thai government deemed it historically inaccurate and insulting to the royal family and banned its distribution in the country. It received mixed reviews from critics who praised the production values, costume design, and musical score but criticised its screenplay, length as well as Foster's choice to play the character which many deemed as a role that required her to play beneath her intelligence. Still it was a box office success grossing $114 million worldwide, against its $92 million budget.

The film received two nominations at the [[72nd Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].

==Plot==

[[Anna Leonowens]] ([[Jodie Foster]]) is a British widow who has come to Siam with her son [[Louis T. Leonowens|Louis]] ([[Tom Felton]]) to teach English to the dozens of children of King [[Mongkut]] ([[Chow Yun-fat]]). She is a strong-willed, intelligent, valiant and benevolent woman for her time, and this pleases the King.  Mongkut wants to modernize Siam, thinking this will help his country resist colonialism and protect the ancient traditions that give Siam its identity. Mongkut and Anna discuss differences between Eastern and Western love, but he dismisses the notion that a man can be happy with only one wife. In order to win favors through Britain's ambassadors, Mongkut orders a sumptuous reception and appoints Anna to organize it. During the reception, the King spars graciously and wittily with Sir Mycroft Kincaid ([[Bill Stewart (actor)|Bill Stewart]]), of the [[East India Company]].  The Europeans express their beliefs that Siam is a superstitious, backward nation.  Mongkut dances with Anna at the reception.

Anna is enchanted by the royal children, particularly Princess [[Chandrmondol|Fa-Ying]] (Melissa Campbell). The little girl adores the playful monkeys who live in the royal garden's trees. When Fa-Ying falls sick with [[cholera]], Anna is summoned to her chambers to say goodbye. She gets there just as Fa-Ying dies in King Mongkut's arms, and the two mourn together. Mongkut later finds that one of the monkeys "borrowed" his glasses as his daughter used to do.  He finds comfort for his grief in his belief in [[reincarnation]], with a notion that Fa-ying might be reborn as one of her beloved animals. Lady Tuptim ([[Bai Ling]]), the King's newest concubine, was already engaged to marry another man, Khun Phra Balat ([[Sean Ghazi]]), when she was brought to court. Mongkut is kind to her, but Tuptim yearns for her true love.  She disguises herself as a young man and runs away, joining the monastery where her former fiancé lives. She is tracked down, returned to the palace, and put on trial where she is caned. Anna, unable to bear the sight, tries to prevent the execution and is forcibly removed from the court. Her outburst prevents Mongkut from showing clemency, because he cannot be seen as beholden to her, though he feels ashamed. Tuptim and Balat are beheaded publicly.

Siam is under siege from what appears to be a British-funded coup d'état against King Mongkut, using [[Burma|Burmese]] soldiers. Mongkut sends his brother [[Pinklao|Prince Chaofa]] ([[Kay Siu Lim]]) and military advisor General Alak ([[Randall Duk Kim]]) and their troops to investigate. However, it turns out Alak is really the man behind the coup, and he poisons the regiment and kills Chaofa. Alak then flees into Burma, where he summons and readies troops to invade Siam, kill King Mongkut and all his children as revenge since he blames him for his family's death.  Mongkut's army is too far from the palace to engage the rebels, so he creates a ruse - that a [[White elephant (animal)|white elephant]] has been spotted, and the court must go to see it. This allows him to flee the palace with his children and wives, and give his armies time to reach them.  Anna returns to help Mongkut, since her presence in his entourage will give credence to the tale about the white elephant. Mongkut plans to take his family to a monastery where he spent part of his life.  Halfway through the journey they see Alak's army in the distance and realize they can't outrun him. Mongkut and his soldiers set explosives on a wooden [[bridge]] high above a canyon floor as Alak and his army approach. Mongkut orders his "army" to stay back and rides to the bridge with only two soldiers. Alak, at the head of his army, confronts Mongkut on the bridge.

Anna and Louis create a brilliant deception from their hiding spot in the forest.  Louis uses his [[Horn (acoustic)|horn]] to replicate the sound of a bugle charge, as Anna "attacks" the area with harmless fireworks. The Burmese, believing the King has brought British soldiers, panic and retreat. Alak's attempt to recall and regroup his troops fails. Alak stands alone, but Mongkut refuses to kill him, saying that Alak will have to live with his shame. As Mongkut turns to ride back to Siam, Alak grabs his gun and aims at his back, but one of Mongkut's guards detonates the explosives.  The bridge and Alak are blown to pieces.

At the end of the film, Mongkut has one last dance with Anna before she leaves Siam. He tells her that now he understands why a man can be content with only one woman. A voice-over tells viewers that Chulalongkorn became king after his father's death.  Chulalongkorn abolished slavery and instituted religious freedom with the help of his father's 'vision'.

==Reception==
''Anna and the King'' received mixed reviews. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds a 51% rating, based on 98 reviews, with the consensus stating that "Beautiful cinematography can't prevent ''Anna and the King'' from being boring and overly lengthy." &lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|1093611-anna_and_the_king|Anna and the King}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a $92 million budget, the film grossed $114 million, making the film a financial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{mojo title|annaandtheking|Anna and the King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anachronism==

This story takes place during the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865); however, the children sang the song "[[Daisy Bell|Daisy, Daisy]]", which was published in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, David (1966). American Popular Songs. Random House. {{ISBN|0-394-41705-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
After reviewing the script, even after changes were made to try to satisfy them, the Thai government did not allow the film-makers to film in Thailand. The Thai authorities did not permit the film to be distributed in Thailand due to scenes that they construed as a disrespectful and historically inaccurate depiction of [[King Mongkut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= Aglionby, John |date= 29 December 1999 |title= Thai censors ban 'insulting' remake of King and I film |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/dec/29/world.news |website= The Guardian |access-date= 29 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Dabbs, writing an opinion piece for the Thai newspaper ''[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]'', criticized the film ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Dabbs, Tony |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/A-strong-disclaimer-could-be-better-than-a-ban-on--494.html |title=A strong disclaimer could be better than a ban on films |website= The Nation |date= |access-date= 29 July 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130818014341/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/A-strong-disclaimer-could-be-better-than-a-ban-on--494.html |archive-date= 18 August 2013 |dead-url= yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3290">The '''Automated Data Inquiry for Oil Spills''' (ADIOS2) software is an oil weathering model provided by [[NOAA]] that incorporates a database containing more than a thousand [[Petroleum|crude oils]] and refined products, and provides quick estimates of the expected characteristics and behavior of [[Oil spill|oil spilled]] into the marine environment. The predictions it makes, presented as both graphics and text, are designed to help answer questions that typically arise during [[Offshore oil spill prevention and response|spill response]] and cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADIOS2 |url=http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/type_topic_entry.php?RECORD_KEY(entry_topic_type)=entry_id,topic_id,type_id&amp;entry_id(entry_topic_type)=181&amp;topic_id(entry_topic_type)=1&amp;type_id(entry_topic_type)=3 |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=14 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513031331/http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/type_topic_entry.php?RECORD_KEY%28entry_topic_type%29=entry_id%2Ctopic_id%2Ctype_id&amp;entry_id%28entry_topic_type%29=181&amp;topic_id%28entry_topic_type%29=1&amp;type_id%28entry_topic_type%29=3 |archivedate=13 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Predictive information for oil spill response==
One user describes the program as follows: "You just key in all the details of the parameters of the spill, from the type of oil to wave conditions, winds, sea temperatures, what have you, and the software tells you the fate of the oil over an extended period."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* By predicting change in an oil's viscosity (resistance to flow) over time, ADIOS2 offers an answer to the question: Can the oil still be dispersed with chemical [[Dispersant#Oil spill|dispersants]]?
* By predicting the rate of increase in an oil's water content over time, ADIOS2 offers an answer to questions like: If {{convert|1,000|USgal|L}} of crude oil has spilled, will more than {{convert|1,000|USgal|L}} of oil-and-water mixture need to be cleaned up and disposed of? How much more?

'''Box social''' is a term for a [[social event]] that was widely used in the early 1900s with varying definitions in [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].

==American usage==

In the U.S. state of [[Vermont]] the tradition is that women decorate a cardboard box and fill it with a lunch or dinner for two. The men bid on the women's boxes anticipating a meal with the woman whose box it is. Generally the boxes are anonymous, so the men don't know which woman belongs to which box, nor what the box contains, the mystery and sometimes humorous results adding to the fun. However, it is not unknown for a young woman to surreptitiously drop hints to a favored man indicating which box is hers, as a way of "rigging" the results (and avoiding potentially less desirable company). The bidding involves teasing, joking, and competition. The event frequently takes place in a [[town hall]], school [[gym]]nasium, or [[church hall]].  

The practice had fallen out of favor with young people in the 1970s–1990s, but has seen some resurgence in recent years. The rules today have become less rigid.  Men now provide boxes as well, but the goal remains the same: raising money for a school, church, or civic project.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} 

A notable example from [[popular culture|pop culture]] is the second act of [[Oklahoma!]], which is set at a box social.

==British usage==
Within the university environment, a box social can be an annual social gathering for a sports club.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

'''Bristol Old Vic''' is a British theatre company based at the '''Theatre Royal, Bristol'''. The present company was established in 1946 as an offshoot of the [[Old Vic]] in [[London]].

==History of the theatre==
The theatre is situated on [[King Street, Bristol|King Street]], a few yards from the [[Bristol Harbour|Floating Harbour]]. From 1972 until 2016, the public entrance was through the Coopers' Hall, the earliest surviving building on the site. The Coopers' Hall was built in 1744 for the Coopers' Company, the [[guild]] of [[cooper (profession)|cooper]]s in Bristol, by [[architect]] [[William Halfpenny]].&lt;ref&gt;

The theatre was built between 1764 and 1766.&lt;ref name="IE"/&gt; The design of the auditorium has traditionally been taken to have been based, with some variations, on that of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London.&lt;ref name=theatretrust&gt;Mark Howell has shown that, when built, Bristol's New Theatre measured 6 rods (roughly 100ft) long and 3 rods (roughly 50ft) wide, comparable with the known dimensions of Drury Lane.

(The yard of the derelict St Nicholas School adjacent to the warehouse was still used by the Company for rehearsals of crowd scenes and stage fights as late as the early 1960s, notably for John Hale's productions of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' starring the Canadian actor Paul Massie and [[Annette Crosbie]], a former student of the School, and [[Edmond Rostand|Rostand]]'s ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' with [[Peter Wyngarde]].

The School continued in these premises until 1954 when royalties from the musical, ''Salad Days'' by [[Julian Slade]] and Dorothy Reynolds were given to the School towards the purchase and conversion of two large adjoining Victorian villas in Clifton, which remain their base today.&lt;ref name="brown-bovts-hist2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Shirley|title=Bristol Old Vic Theatre School: the first 50 years|publisher=Bristol Old Vic Theatre School|location=Bristol|pages=38–48|year=1996|edition=I|isbn=1-85459-395-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, that donation was formally recognised when a new custom-built dance and movement studio in the School's back garden was named the ''Slade/Reynolds Studio''.&lt;ref name="brown-bovts-hist3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Shirley|title=Bristol Old Vic Theatre School: the first 50 years|publisher=Bristol Old Vic Theatre School|location=Bristol|page=186|year=1996|edition=I|isbn=1-85459-395-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School provides comprehensive training courses for theatre, radio, film, and television professionals and its graduates are to be found in key positions as actors, directors, set designers, costumer designers, lighting designers and stage and company managers throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Broadway Theatre''' near 41st Street was a [[Manhattan]] theatre in operation from 1888 to 1929.&lt;ref name="1929-one"&gt;(6 January 1929). [https://www.nytimes.com/1929/01/06/archives/the-broadway-theatre-passes-playhouse-build-by-james-bailey-partner.html The Broadway Theatre Passes; Playhouse Built by James Bailey, Partner of P.T. Barnum, Over Forty Years Ago Witnessed the Last Engagements of Booth and Irving and the Premiere of Ben Hur], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  It was located at 1445 Broadway.

==History==
[[James Anthony Bailey]], a circus manager and owner (the "Bailey" in [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]]) started building the theatre in 1887 on the site of what had been the "Metropolitan Concert Hall" built in 1880. Bailey pulled out, and the project was completed by Frank Sanger, T.H. French, and E. Zborowski, with seating for about 1,800 and standing room for 500  more.&lt;ref name="1929-one"/&gt; The American premiere of ''[[La Tosca]]'' was performed on the theatre's opening night, March 3, 1888, featuring [[Fanny Davenport]]. It was not a great success, due in part to the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]] hitting New York ten days later, and it closed on April 28.&lt;ref name="toscaends"&gt;(28 April 1888). [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1888-04-28/ed-1/seq-6/ Advertisement], ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'' (advertisement for last show on April 28, 1888 - Bloom book incorrectly says March 28; ''[[The Queen's Mate]]'' set to start on May 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful run was ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'', with the title role alternately played by [[Elsie Leslie]] and Tommy Russell, which hit 100 showings on March 21, 1889.&lt;ref name="1929-one"/&gt; [[Lawrence Barrett]]'s final performance was at the theatre in March 1891, when he became ill during a performance of ''Richelieu''. [[Edwin Booth]]'s last New York performance occurred at the theatre that same month. ''[[El Capitan (operetta)|El Capitan]]'', [[John Philip Sousa]]'s most enduring operetta, opened here in 1896 before tours, revivals and a successful London run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicaltheatreguide.com/composers/sousa/elcapitain.htm ''El Capitan''], The Guide to Light Opera and Operetta, accessed December 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The highly successful ''[[Ben-Hur (play)|Ben-Hur]]'' debuted in November 1899, the greatest production which the theatre ever hosted.&lt;ref name="1929-one"/&gt; [[Mrs. Leslie Carter]], who later obtained fame with ''[[The Heart of Maryland (play)|The Heart of Maryland]]'', made her stage debut at the Broadway Theatre in 1890 in ''The Ugly Duckling''.

Starting around 1903, the theatre featured almost all musical productions.  In 1913, after the closing of ''The American Maid'', the theatre was used for [[vaudeville]] and motion picture shows.

==Demise== 
The last performance was a vaudeville show called ''Broadway Fever'' in January 1929, and the theatre was soon after demolished.&lt;ref name="1929-one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1929-two"&gt;(3 January 1929).

[https://books.google.com/books?id=fYbYyQjHwdsC&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Broadway: Its History, People, and Places : an Encyclopedia 2d ed.], p. 84-85 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  The site is now occupied by the 33-story Bricken-Textile Building, built in 1929.&lt;ref name="now"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=80HCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false New York Then and Now], p. 19 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the former Colony Theatre on 53rd Street was renamed the [[Broadway Theatre (53rd Street)|Broadway Theatre]], which name it still retains.

Since the  first  decades  of  the  20th  century, industrialized countries have seen the  problem  of  traffic  accidents  rising &lt;ref&gt;http://www.roneurosurgery.eu/atdoc/CiuchilanElena_Epidemiology_f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Road toll figures in developed nations show that car collision fatalities have declined since 1980. Japan is an extreme [[List of motor vehicle deaths in Japan by year|example]], with road deaths decreasing to 5,115 in 2008, which is 25% of the 1970 rate per capita and 17% of the 1970 rate per vehicle distance travelled. In 2008, for the first time, more pedestrians than vehicle occupants were killed in Japan by cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/pedestrians-become-chief-victims-of-road-accident-deaths-in-2008 Pedestrians become chief victims of road accident deaths in 2008] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090725140530/http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/pedestrians-become-chief-victims-of-road-accident-deaths-in-2008 |date=25 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides improving general road conditions like lighting and separated walkways, Japan has been installing [[intelligent transportation system]] technology such as stalled-car monitors to avoid crashes.

In developing nations, statistics may be grossly inaccurate or hard to get. Some nations have not significantly reduced the total death rate, which stands at 12,000 in Thailand in 2007, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.thaihealth.or.th/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=133&amp;Itemid=1 365 Days for Stopping Accident Deaths]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, twenty-eight states had reductions in the number of automobile crash fatalities between 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoaccidentattorneys.net/injuries/auto-death-state.html People Killed in Motor Vehicle Crashes, by State, 2005-2006]&lt;/ref&gt; 55% of vehicle occupants 16 years or older in 2006 were not using [[seat belts]] when they crashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = NCSA Research Note (DOT-HS-810-948) | publisher = US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] |date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Road fatality trends tend to follow [[Smeed's law]],&lt;ref name=smeed&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jadams/PDFs/smeed%27s%20law.pdf | format = PDF | first = John | last = Adams | publisher = [[University College London]] | title = Smeed's Law : some further thoughts }}&lt;/ref&gt; an empirical schema that correlates increased fatality rates per capita with [[traffic congestion]].

Crashes are categorized by what is struck and the direction of impact, or impacts. These are some common crash types, based on the total number that occurred in the U.S.A. in 2005, the percentage of total crashes, and the percentage of fatal crashes:&lt;ref&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Traffic Safety Facts 2005, 2007, P. 54. http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/810631.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Rear-end collision|Rear impacts]] (1,824,000 crashes, 29.6% of all US crashes, 5.4% of US fatal crashes)
* [[Side collision|Angle or side impacts]] (1,779,000 crashes, 28.9% of all US crashes, 20.7% of US fatal crashes)
* [[Run-off-road collision]]s (992,000 crashes, 16.1% of US crashes, 31.7% of US fatal crashes)
* Collisions with animals (275,000 crashes, 4.5% of US crashes, 0.4% of fatal crashes)
* [[Rollover]]s (141,000 crashes, 2.3% of all US crashes, 10.9% of US fatal crashes)
* [[Head-on collision]] (123,000 crashes, only 2.0% of all US crashes, but 10.1% of US fatal crashes)
* Collisions with pedestrians and bicyclists (114,000 crashes, only 1.8% of US crashes, but 13.5% of US fatal crashes)
* [[Back-up collision]]s killed 221 people in the US in 2007, and injured about 14,400. This is one of the most common types of non-traffic auto collision in which road workers and children 15 and younger are killed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/automobiles/12VIEW.html?ref=automobiles ''The Risk of Reverse'']. ''[[The New York Times]]'' 10 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/01-128.pdf |title=Building Safer Highway Work Zones: Measures to Prevent Worker Injuries From Vehicles and Equipment }} [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]], April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rollover, head-on, pedestrian, and bicyclist crashes combined are only 6.1% of all crashes, but cause 34.5% of traffic-related fatalities.

Sometimes the vehicles in the collision can suffer more than one type of impact, such as during a shunt or high-speed spin. This is called a "second harmful event," such as when a vehicle is redirected by the first crash into another vehicle or fixed object.

The '''Four Asian Tigers''', '''Four Asian Dragons''' or '''Four Little Dragons''', are the economies of [[Economy of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Economy of Singapore|Singapore]], [[Economy of South Korea|South Korea]] and [[Economy of Taiwan|Taiwan]], which underwent rapid [[industrialization]] and maintained exceptionally high [[Economic growth|growth]] rates (in excess of 7 percent a year) between the early 1960s (mid-1950s for Hong Kong) and 1990s.  By the early 21st century, all four had developed into [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economies]], specializing in areas of competitive advantage. Hong Kong and Singapore have become world-leading international [[financial centre]]s, whereas South Korea and Taiwan are world leaders in manufacturing [[electronics|electronic]] components and devices.

Prior to the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], the growth of the Four Asian Tiger economies (commonly referred to as "the Asian Miracle") has been attributed to export oriented policies and strong development policies. Unique to these economies were the sustained rapid growth and high levels of equal income distribution. A World Bank report suggests two development policies among others as sources for the Asian miracle: factor accumulation and macroeconomic management.&lt;ref name="Page 1994"&gt;{{Cite book

The Hong Kong economy was the first out of the four to undergo industrialization with the development of a textile industry in the 1950s. By the 1960s, manufacturing in the British colony had expanded and diversified to include clothing, electronics, and plastics for [[export-oriented industrialization|export orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/economic-history-of-hong-kong/ "Economic History of Hong Kong"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417050303/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/economic-history-of-hong-kong/ |date=17 April 2015 }}, Schenk, Catherine.

Both countries pursued export-oriented industrialization as in Hong Kong and Singapore.&lt;ref name="Hunt2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael H. Hunt|title=The World Transformed: 1945 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkuEQgAACAAJ|date=10 November 2003|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|isbn=978-0-312-24583-2|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four countries were inspired by Japan's evident success, and they collectively pursued the same goal by investing in the same categories: infrastructure and education. They also benefited from foreign trade advantages that sets them apart from other countries, most significantly economic support from the United States; part of this is manifested in the perforation of American electronic products in common households of the Four Tigers.

By the end of the 1960s, levels in physical and [[human capital]] in the four economies far exceeded other countries at similar levels of development. This subsequently led to a rapid growth in [[per capita income]] levels. While high investments were essential to their economic growth, the role of human capital was also important. Education in particular is cited as playing a major role in the Asian economic miracle. The levels of education enrollment in the Four Asian Tigers were higher than predicted given their level of income. By 1965, all four nations had achieved universal [[primary education]].&lt;ref name="Page 1994"/&gt; South Korea in particular had achieved a secondary education enrollment rate of 88% by 1987.&lt;ref name="Page 1994"/&gt; There was also a notable decrease in the gap between male and female enrollments during the Asian miracle. Overall these advances in education allowed for high levels of literacy and cognitive skills.

The creation of stable [[macroeconomic]] environments was the foundation upon which the Asian miracle was built. Each of the Four Asian Tiger states managed, to various degrees of success, three variables in: [[budget deficits]], [[external debt]] and [[exchange rates]]. Each Tiger nation's budget deficits were kept within the limits of their financial limits, as to not destabilize the macro-economy. South Korea in particular had deficits lower than the [[OECD]] average in the 1980s. External debt was non-existent for Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, as they did not borrow from abroad.&lt;ref name="Page 1994"/&gt; Although South Korea was the exception to this - its debt to GNP ratio was quite high during the period 1980-1985, it was sustained by the country’s high level of exports. Exchange rates in the Four Asian Tiger nations had been changed from long-term fixed rate regimes to fixed-but-adjustable rate regimes with the occasional steep devaluation of managed floating rate regimes.&lt;ref name="Page 1994"/&gt; This active exchange rate management allowed the Four Tiger economies to avoid exchange rate appreciation and maintain a stable real exchange rate.

Export policies have been the de facto reason for the rise of these Four Asian Tiger economies. The approach taken has been different among the four nations. Hong Kong, and Singapore introduced trade regimes that were neoliberal in nature and encouraged free trade, while South Korea and Taiwan adopted mixed regimes that accommodated their own export industries. In Hong Kong and Singapore, due to small domestic markets, domestic prices were linked to international prices. South Korea and Taiwan introduced export incentives for the traded-goods sector. The governments of Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also worked to promote specific exporting industries, which were termed as an export push strategy. All these policies helped these four nations to achieve a growth averaging 7.5% each year for three decades and as such they achieved [[developed country]] status.&lt;ref name="Economist 2009"&gt;

Dani Rodrik, economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, has in a number of studies argued that state intervention was important in the East Asian growth miracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodrik|first=Dani|last2=Grossman|first2=Gene|last3=Norman|first3=Victor|date=1995|title=Getting Interventions Right: How South Korea and Taiwan Grew Rich|jstor=1344538|journal=Economic Policy|volume=10|issue=20|pages=55–107|doi=10.2307/1344538}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He has argued "it is impossible to understand the East Asian growth miracle without appreciating the important role that government policy played in stimulating private investment".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1997 Asian financial crisis ===
The Tiger economies experienced a setback in the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. Hong Kong came under intense speculative attacks against its stock market and currency necessitating unprecedented market interventions by the state [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]]. South Korea was hit the hardest as its foreign debt burdens swelled resulting in its currency falling between 35–50%.&lt;ref name="Pam Woodall 1998 S3-S5"&gt;{{Cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of 1997, the stock market in Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea also saw losses of at least 60% in dollar terms. Singapore and Taiwan were relatively unscathed. The Four Asian Tigers recovered from the 1997 crisis faster than other countries due to various economic advantages including their high savings rate (except South Korea) and their openness to trade.&lt;ref name="Pam Woodall 1998 S3-S5"/&gt;

=== 2008 financial crisis ===
The export-oriented tiger economies, which benefited from American consumption, were hit hard by the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. By the fourth quarter of 2008, the [[GDP]] of all four nations fell by an average annualized rate of around 15%.&lt;ref name="Economist 2009"/&gt;
Exports also fell by a 50% annualized rate.&lt;ref name="Economist 2009"/&gt;
Weak domestic demand also affected the recovery of these economies. In 2008, retail sales fell 3% in Hong Kong, 6% in Singapore and 11% in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Economist 2009"/&gt;

As the world recovers from the financial crisis, the Four Asian Tiger economies have also rebounded strongly. This is due in no small part to each country's government fiscal stimulus measures. These fiscal packages accounted for more than 4% of each country's GDP in 2009.&lt;ref name="Economist 2009"/&gt;
Another reason for the strong bounce back is the modest corporate and household debt in these four nations.&lt;ref name="Economist 2009"/&gt;

A recent article published in ''Applied Economics Letters'' by financial economist Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich Business School and his international colleagues investigates the causal relationship between financial development and economic growth for [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]], [[India]] and Singapore for the period between 1979 and 2009, using [[Johansen cointegration test]]s and vector [[error correction model]]s. The results suggest that in the case of Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, China and India financial development leads to economic growth, whereas in the case of Thailand there exists a bidirectional causality between these variables. The results further suggest that in the case of Malaysia, financial development does not seem to cause economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |surname1=Mukhopadhyaya |given1=Bidisha |surname2=Pradhana |given2=Rudra P. |surname3=Feridun |given3=Mete |year=2011 |title=Finance-growth nexus revisited for some Asian countries |journal=Applied Economics Letters |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1527–1530 |doi=10.1080/13504851.2010.548771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gross domestic product (GDP) ==
In 2013, the combined economy of the Four Asian Tigers constituted 3.81% of the world's economy with a total [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product (GDP)]] of 2,366 billion US dollars. The GDP in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan was worth 274.01 billion, 297.94 billion, 1,304.55 billion and 489.21 billion US dollars respectively in 2013, which represented 0.44%, 0.48%, 2.10% and 0.79% of the world economy. Together, their combined economy is close to [[United Kingdom]]'s GDP of 4.07% of the world's economy.

== Education and technology ==

These four countries invested heavily in their infrastructure as well as in developing the intellectual abilities of their human talent, fostering and retaining their educated population to help further develop and improve their respective countries. This policy turned out to be so effective that by the late 20th century, all four countries had developed into [[Developed country#IMF advanced economy list|advanced]] and [[High income economy|high-income]] [[industrialized]] [[developed countries]], developing many different areas of advanced technology that give them a tremendous competitive advantage in the world. For example, all four countries have become top level global education centers with Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong high school students consistently outperforming all other countries in the world and achieving the highest top scores on international math and science exams such as the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA exam]] and with [[Taiwan]] students winning multiple [[gold medal]]s every year consistently at the [[International Biology Olympiad]], [[International Linguistics Olympiad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201708060014.aspx|title=Taiwan team wins gold at International Linguistic Olympiad|date=6 August 2017|first1=Tai|last1=Ya-chen|first2=S.C.|last2=Chang|publisher=The Central News Agency|work=Focus Taiwan|accessdate=16 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807070553/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201708060014.aspx|archivedate=7 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Physics Olympiad]], [[International Earth Science Olympiad]], [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] and [[International Chemistry Olympiad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=10,10,10&amp;post=119180|title=Taiwan students excel at International Biology Olympiad|date=31 July 2017|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|work=Taiwan Today|accessdate=16 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806222306/http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=10%2C10%2C10&amp;post=119180|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&amp;post=118517|title=Taiwan students shine at International Chemistry Olympiad|date=17 July 2017|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|work=Taiwan Today|accessdate=16 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807021029/http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2%2C6%2C10%2C15%2C18&amp;post=118517|archivedate=7 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201707220013.aspx|title=Taiwan wins 6 medals at Math Olympiad in Brazil|date=22 July 2017|first1=Chen|last1=Chih-chung|first2=Romulo|last2=Huang|publisher=The Central News Agency|work=Focus Taiwan|accessdate=16 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806222051/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201707220013.aspx|archivedate=6 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maureensullivan/2016/11/30/who-has-the-smartest-math-and-science-students-singapore/#79a59f291913|title=Who Has The Smartest Math And Science Students?

== Cultural basis ==
The role of [[Confucianism]] has been used to explain the success of the Four Asian Tigers. This conclusion is similar to the [[Protestant work ethic]] theory in the West promoted by German sociologist [[Max Weber]] in his book ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. The [[East Asian cultural sphere|culture of Confucianism]] is said to have been compatible with industrialization because it valued stability, hard work, discipline, and loyalty and respect towards authority figures.&lt;ref name="L"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin|first=Justin Yifu|title=Demystifying the Chinese Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxzJoskK_rwC&amp;pg=PA107|date=27 October 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-19180-7|page=107|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729074006/https://books.google.com/books?id=rxzJoskK_rwC&amp;pg=PA107|archivedate=29 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant influence of Confucianism on the corporate and political institutions of the Asian Tigers. Prime Minister of Singapore [[Lee Kuan Yew]] advocated [[Asian values]] as an alternative to the influence of Western culture in Asia.&lt;ref name="Dub"&gt;{{cite book|last=DuBois|first=Thomas David|title=Religion and the Making of Modern East Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NH4Jeh5QG4C&amp;pg=PA227|date=25 April 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49946-0|pages=227–228|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103032318/https://books.google.com/books?id=7NH4Jeh5QG4C&amp;pg=PA227|archivedate=3 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was not without its critics. There was a lack of mainland Chinese economic success during the same time frame as the Four Tigers, and yet China was the birthplace of Confucianism. During the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, Confucianism was blamed for China's inability to compete with Western powers.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;

Garcia Barbon theatre was built in the late nineteenth century in the centre of [[Vigo]], a city in Northwestern [[Pontevedre]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]  [[Spain]]. Sponsors included an enthusiastic group of locals who wanted to promote theatrical culture in the city.  Alter years with a lot of economic problems, the theatre was opened on July 15 of 1900 as "Rosalía de Castro Theatre" and its first performance the opera Aida.

Years after was inaugurated and after a period of economic failure, the theater went bankrupt. It was a store for a short period of time before popular support and benefactor José García Barbon recovered the property and returned it to play representations.

On February 8, 1910, after the function in Carnival Tuesday, a fire completely charred the building, leaving the city without a theater again. Three years later, thanks to José García Barbon’s nieces who decided to continue the work of his uncle. The Galician architect [[Antonio Palacios]] was responsible for the construction of the new theatre building. Described as Neo-Baroque, a mainstream style in the beginning of the twentieth century, it was inspired by the [[Paris Opera]] of [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] and the [[Arriaga Theatre]] of Bilbao.

The new theatre was opened on April 23, 1927, under the name of Garcia Barbon theatre but it was not only a theatre, it was also auditorium and Casino,  where people can see different kinds of show and becoming a meeting point.

During the seventies the building was bought by "Caja de Ahorros Municipal de Vigo" a regional Savings Bank from the same city. This entity spends more than 6 million of Euros in an important rehabilitation done by the architect Desiderio Pernas, expanding the theatre, creating a library in a new top floor and giving a new image to the building.

On March 22 of 1984 the building was reopened as the “Centro Cultural Caixanova” to be the bigger project conducted by the entity.

'''The Hilton Arts Festival''' is an arts festival in South Africa. It is held on the [[Hilton College (South Africa)|Hilton College]] campus each year in September and runs for four days. The festival began in 1993 and was designed to emulate the [[National Arts Festival]] in [[Grahamstown]].

The annual Hilton Arts Festival features a program of theatre, music, dance, craft and visual art, as well as food. The Hilton College Theatre is the second largest, fixed-seated venue in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], with a seating capacity of 486.

The festival is attended by a large number of well known local and international stars, such as [[Johnny Clegg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://showme.co.za/events-entertainment/the-witness-hilton-arts-festival/|title=The Witness Hilton Arts Festival|date=16 September 2016|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pillay|first=Shan|title=Hilton Arts Festival starts today|url=http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&amp;global[_id]=68561|work=The Witness|accessdate=16 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026115000/http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&amp;global%5B_id%5D=88529|archivedate=26 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sinkins|first=Estelle|title=Hilton Arts Festival|url=http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&amp;global[_id]=68413|work=The Witness|accessdate=16 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026115000/http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&amp;global%5B_id%5D=88529|archivedate=26 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horasis''' is an independent [[think tank]] based in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], which was established in 2005 by [[Frank-Jürgen Richter]], its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/fii-view/indian-companies-to-benefiteu-crisis-expert_566547.html |title=Indian companies to benefit from EU crisis: Expert - CNBC-TV18 |publisher=Moneycontrol.com |date=2011-07-19 |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horasis holds invitation-only meetings of global business leaders with a regional focus on [[China]], [[India]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. It has been dubbed "a kind of junior league World Economic Forum for the emerging market set" by [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/asia/09iht-letter.html?pagewanted=all|author=Tom Redburn|title=Enthusiasm Temepered With Concern, About Business in India|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also  holds a  Global Meeting, and hosts private events for the Horasis Visionary Circle, a peer-to-peer group of entrepreneurs. 
==Activities==
Horasis  provides a platform for cooperation and knowledge-sharing, particularly between developed countries and emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstoday.co.om/disCon.aspx?Cval=908 |title=Article: Emerging markets to the fore |publisher=Businesstoday.co.om |date= |accessdate=2013-07-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314210959/http://www.businesstoday.co.om/disCon.aspx?Cval=908|archivedate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community works principally through partnerships with corporations, governments and international organizations, often serving as an incubator for new initiatives.These meetings rotate amongst host countries which stage the events;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcit.gov.cy/mcit/mcit.nsf/0/69FAA238A35E51B4C225787000247859?OpenDocument |title=Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism - Archived Speeches/Articles/Interviews - Global Russia Business Meeting, address by Minister of Commerce |publisher=Mcit.gov.cy |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; selected corporations supplement speeches and presentations about actual topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofcyprus.com.cy/en-GB/Cyprus/News-Archive/The-Bank-of-Cyprus-at-the-Global-Russia-Business-Meeting/ |title=The Bank of Cyprus at the Global Russia Business Meeting - Bank of Cyprus Country Cyprus |publisher=Bankofcyprus.com.cy |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/lu/en/china/global-china-business-meeting.jhtml |title=Global China Business Meeting by PwC PwC Luxembourg |publisher=Pwc.com |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horasis meetings are usually held in a host country outside the   geographic location of the 'in-focus' nation. The events are a means for the countries 'in focus' as guests (China, India, and South East Asia) to promote relations with the world and to display [[soft power]] through co-option and cooperation. The meetings are also a platform for the  host country to engage in  policy dialogue with the guest countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/salle_presse/discours/premier_ministre/2010/11-novembre/22-juncker/index.html |title=Jean-Claude Juncker, Discours à l'occasion du Global China Business Meeting, Luxembourg |publisher=Gouvernement.lu |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2013-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323003412/http://www.gouvernement.lu/salle_presse/discours/premier_ministre/2010/11-novembre/22-juncker/index.html |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metricstream.com/pressNews/pr_307_horasis_summit_italy_gunjan_sinha.html |title=Gunjan Sinha to participate in the Horasis Summit in Naples, Italy – Press Release |publisher=Metricstream.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling''''' is an American animated television series that originally aired on [[CBS]] Saturday mornings from September 14, 1985 to October 18, 1986, with reruns airing until June 27, 1987.&lt;ref name=bcdb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Other_Studios/D/DiC_Entertainment/Hulk_Hogan_s_Rock_N__Wrestling/ |title=Hulk Hogan's Rock N' Wrestling Episode Guide -DiC Ent &amp;#124; Big Cartoon DataBase |website=Bcdb.com |date= |accessdate=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling'' was animated and produced by [[DIC Entertainment]]. It featured animated adventures of popular [[WWE|WWF]] stars from the time, including its title character [[Hulk Hogan]] and his group of wrestlers fighting against a group of rogue wrestlers led by [[Roddy Piper|Rowdy Roddy Piper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wrestling Cartoon Puts Hold On Taste|work= Orlando Sentinel|date=|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1985-04-24/lifestyle/0290240203_1_animated-series-hulk-hogan-gummi-bears|accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show followed cartoon archetypes concerning good characters triumphing over evil-doers in wacky situations, typical of children's cartoons in the 1980s.

Rarely referenced, wrestling was simply a device to determine the good guys from the bad guys. The wrestlers themselves appeared in the live-action segments of the show; however, due to their busy travel schedule, they did not provide the voices for their animated counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/hulk-hogans-rock-n-wrestling-26133777/page-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524193334/http://www.wwe.com/classics/hulk-hogans-rock-n-wrestling-26133777/page-2 |archivedate=2015-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were instead performed by professional [[voice acting|voice actors]]. One recurring live-action segment was the [[music video]] for the [[cover song|cover]] of "[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]" recorded by several WWF wrestlers for ''[[The Wrestling Album]]''.

Due to the show being animated and the longer production times that resulted, it often failed to keep pace with the events of the WWF at the time. This resulted in certain wrestlers turning [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] (or, in non-wrestling terms, a [[villain]]) in regular WWF programming but remaining good guys on the cartoon and vice versa; examples include Rowdy Roddy Piper (who was a villain when the show debuted but became a face in the fall of 1986, despite remaining a bad guy in the cartoon) and [[André the Giant]] (who was a face in the fall of 1985 but turned heel in early 1987, despite remaining on the good guys' side throughout the series' run). Additionally, the characters of [[Jimmy Snuka|Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka]] and [[Wendi Richter]] remained throughout the series' run, despite both having left the WWF in late 1985. It also depicted Hogan as having a full head of hair, as opposed to the noticeably [[male pattern baldness|receding hairline]] he sported in the ring.

WWE (as the WWF was renamed in 2002 after the company lost a [[lawsuit]] against the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]) currently own the rights to the program.

In April 2015, WWE announced that the program would be added to the [[WWE Network]], making its premiere following the April 20 episode of ''[[WWE Raw]]''. On July 24, 2015, Hulk Hogan was fired by the WWE and references to Hulk Hogan including ''Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling'' were removed from the WWE network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/07/24/hulk-hogan-erased-from-wwe-website-amid-reports-wrestler-booted-from/|title=Wwe Terminates Contract With Hulk Hogan; Wrestler Sorry He Used 'n-word'|date=24 July 2015|website=Foxnews.com|accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
Hulk Hogan was the leader of the [[face (professional wrestling)|faces]], or good guys; consisting of [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Lou Albano|Captain Lou Albano]], [[André the Giant]], [[Wendi Richter]], [[Jimmy Snuka|Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka]], [[Hillbilly Jim]], and [[Tito Santana]]. Rowdy Roddy Piper was the leader of the [[heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], or bad guys; consisting of [[The Iron Sheik]], [[Nikolai Volkoff]], [[The Fabulous Moolah]], [[Big John Studd]], and [[Mr. Fuji]]. [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]] and [[Gene Okerlund|"Mean" Gene Okerlund]] appeared animated in a few episodes as well.

==Music==
The opening theme to ''Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling'' is "Hulk Hogan's Theme", composed by [[Jim Steinman]]. It was also used as Hogan's ring entrance theme, before being replaced with "Real American" by [[Rick Derringer]]. Steinman later reworked "Hulk Hogan's Theme" into "Ravishing", performed by [[Bonnie Tyler]] and featured on her 1986 album ''[[Secret Dreams and Forbidden Fire]]''.

'''Lewie Griffith Merritt''' (nicknamed "Griff") (June 26, 1897 – March 24, 1974) was a [[Major General]] and early [[aviator]] in the [[United States Marine Corps]].  Merritt served over 30 years in the Marine Corps, including service in [[World War I]] at Belleau Wood and as an aviator during [[World War II]] in both the European and Pacific Theaters.  After retiring from the Marine Corps, Merritt practiced law in South Carolina.

==Education and career==
Lewie Merritt was born on June 26, 1897, in Ridge Springs, South Carolina. In 1917, Merritt graduated from [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]] at the age of 19 and received a commission in the Marine Corps.  He served in the [[Dominican Republic]] that same year, and in 1918 served in [[France]] during [[World War I]]. He and several other Citadel graduates became a part of the famous '[[Devil Dog]]s' of Marine Corps legend at the [[Battle of Belleau Wood]] in 1918.  Following the war Merritt served on the staff of 2 Marine Corps Commandants and was commander of the Marine detachment on the battleship [[USS New Mexico]].
In 1923, Merritt began training as a [[naval aviator]] at [[Pensacola Naval Air Station]]; he received his "Wings of Gold" in January, 1924.  In 1928 he received a [[law degree]] from [[George Washington University]] followed by service with the Navy Judge Advocate Generals Office in Washington, DC.
Merritt became one of the first Marine aviators qualified to fly off aircraft carriers and is credited with developing the concepts of dive bombing and close air support; his advocacy of air power was instrumental in helping integrate aviation into Marine combat doctrine.  Merritt commanded an observation squadron in Haiti and attended the Army Air Corps Tactical School; in 1941 he was assigned as commander for air, Fleet Marine Force Pacific, where he was responsible for establishing the 2d Marine Air Wing in Hawaii and bolstering defenses at Wake and Midway Islands.  In January 1942 he was promoted to Brigadier General and assigned as air attache at the US Embassy in London.

General Merritt was the only Marine Corps Aviator to serve in both the European and Asian Theaters of battle during World War II.

==Later years==
After the war, Merritt served on President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Strategic Bombing Survey]], which examined U.S. bombing successes against [[Japan]]ese targets; he retired from the Marine Corps in 1947. Merritt practiced law in Columbia, South Carolina, then was chosen by Governor Strom Thurmond to serve as director of the South Carolina Legislative Council. He also managed the successful campaign of Lt. Gov. George Timmerman for governor in 1956.

He died after a lengthy illness at [[Fort Sam Houston]], [[Texas]], on March 24, 1974.  He is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Whittle_Kullberg_Citadel/&gt;

In 1975, the airfield at [[Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort]] in [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], [[South Carolina]], was renamed in his honor; it is now known as [[Merritt Field]].

[[File:Smashbox Studios 10-18-2007.jpg|thumb|Mercedes Benz Fashion Week 2008]]
'''Fashion Week''' in '''Los Angeles''' occurs biannually. Multiple show producers hold events throughout the Greater Los Angeles area each March and October. Traditionally, the City of Los Angeles identified the third weekend of those respective months as the beginning of its Fashion Week.  However, new independent event producers have been transitioning Fashion Week related activities to coincide closer in time with the LA Fashion Market Week.&lt;ref&gt;http://lafashionweek.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Los Angeles Fashion Week was created as a West Coast alternative to [[New York Fashion Week]], originally Press Week, which was created by [[Eleanor Lambert]] in 1953&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2015/02/13/fashion-week-press-week/#B_BBsizL0kq3&lt;/ref&gt;. Independently produced events, working  alongside designers began inviting fashion journalists to see collections from Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&amp;id=7051773&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, Fashion Week has been represented by a community of L.A. fashion producers, designers, journalists, and marketers interested in its success.

In 2002, [[IMG (company)|IMG]]'s fashion division, which produces [[New York Fashion Week|Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week]] in New York, made its first foray west, with [[Mercedes-Benz]] Shows LA in downtown Los Angeles at The Standard hotel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Downtown-LA-Fashion-Week/122851463096&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, Davis Factor and Dean Factor produced Smashbox Fashion Week Los Angeles at Smashbox Studios in Culver City. Dozens of designers showed their collections to journalists, celebrities, family and friends at these two centralized venues, while others still chose to show their collections in unique off site venues such as nightclubs, private estates, train stations, churches and lofts. In 2003, IMG and Smashbox united under one banner to streamline services and venues, choosing the Factor-owned Smashbox Studios Culver City location over downtown Los Angeles venues. The relationship between IMG and Smashbox Studios lasted for five years, with the October 2008 shows marking their final presentation together.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/07/image/ig-lafashionweek7&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, the now-defunct LA Fashion Awards debuted to celebrate and honor the very best of California fashion. The annual Awards were timed at the closing of Fashion Week and the opening of Market Week in October, at the service of both retail store buyers and press. A nominating committee of more than forty of LA's top fashion journalists, merchandisers, stylists, designers and marketplace experts participate in the selection process. Among past winners are educator [[Rosemary Brantley]]; retailers Ron Herman, [[Fred Segal]], Cameron Silver and Christos Garkinos; designers Trina Turk, [[Monique Lhuillier]] and [[Max Azria]]; fashion innovators Nony Tochterman of Petro Zillia, Rozae Nichols and Juan Carlos Obando; journalist Rose Apodaca; stylist [[Arianne Phillips]]; web publisher [[DailyCandy]]; event producer [[Gen Art]]; brands [[American Apparel]], [[Volcom]], J Brand, [[bebe stores|Bebe]], [[Guess (clothing)|Guess]]; and the television show ''[[Project Runway]]''. The program was produced by LA Fashion Awards, LLC, which was co-founded by fashion industry veterans Jennifer Uner and Mary Hill with the support of several visionary sponsors and the endorsement of local fashion industry non-profit organizations California Fashion Association, Fashion Group International of Los Angeles, Fashion Business Incorporated, the Fashion District BID, and also the [[Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation]]. The Awards were placed on hiatus in October 2008 after sponsorship support was put on hold in the wake of the financial market meltdown that September.

In February 2007, artist Peter Gurnz, developer Gary Warfel, and downtown resident Brady Westwater – all members of the Downtown Los Angeles Neighborhood Council (DLANC) – created an alternative Fashion Week venue in Downtown Los Angeles,  It was produced by a local arts organization, BOXeight, founded by artist/designer Peter Gurnz. In Spring 2007, after just six weeks of preparation, BOXeight Fashion Week had its first show at the [[Los Angeles Theater]].  In Fall 2007, it moved to Vibiana LA, the newly restored [[Cathedral of Saint Vibiana]]. In 2008, it moved again, this time eastward to BOXeight's headquarters on the fringe of downtown's [[warehouse district]], which added further patina to its independent street credibility.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/07/image/ig-lafashionweek7&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, City of Los Angeles Mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] recognized the contributions of the fashion industry with a compelling speech at the opening of the LA Fashion Awards and visited the Designers &amp; Agents trade show and the wholesale showrooms at the Cooper Design Space, New Mart and California Market Center. Early in 2008, the mayor's office briefly formed a committee to better harness and organise the energies of the loose consortium that has worked diligently to improve the reputation of Los Angeles as a fashion capital and the bottom lines of the businesses operating there.

Los Angeles' Fashion Week has traditionally been characterized by the diversity of independent productions operating throughout the metro area.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/19/image/la-ig-los-angeles-fashion-week-20131019&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, Main event producers are LA Fashion Week (LAFW.net), and Art Hearts Fashion &lt;ref&gt;https://www.apparelnews.net/news/2018/oct/01/los-angeles-fashion-week-spring-2019-calendar/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lafashionweek.net/producers&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mag''''' was a [[Slovenian language]] weekly news and political magazine published in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], between 1994 and 2010.

==History and profile==
''Mag'' was first published in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leopoldina Plut-Pregelj|author2=Carole Rogel|title=The A to Z of Slovenia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMforkIDPrcC&amp;pg=PA367|accessdate=15 November 2014|date=20 May 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4617-3175-7|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was based in Ljubljana and was published on a weekly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media ownership in Slovenia|url=http://www.vlada.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/cns/doc/0711231951531_media_ownership_in_slovenia.doc|work=Vlada|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weekly provided political news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovenia Press|url=http://www.pressreference.com/Sa-Sw/Slovenia.html|work=Press Reference|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher and owner of the magazine was the Delo publishing house which bought it in 2006.&lt;ref name=ejc&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovenia|url=http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/slovenia|work=European Journalism Centre|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Georgios Terzis|title=European Media Governance: National and Regional Dimensions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68nbtqst-CsC&amp;pg=PA434|accessdate=15 November 2014|year=2007|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-84150-192-5|page=434}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007 the weekly was sold to Salomon 2000 which also published it.&lt;ref name=fhouse&gt;{{cite web|title=Nations in transition.

In early years ''Mag'' was a [[right-wing]] [[conservative]] publication.&lt;ref name=euro&gt;{{cite web|title=Mag|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/medienindex/media_articles/?frommedia=18637|work=Euro Topics|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ljiljana Saric|title=Contesting Europe's Eastern Rim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vFeeIodS-AC&amp;pg=PA125|accessdate=16 November 2014|date=1989|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-84769-486-7|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; However with the dismissal of the [[editor-in-chief]] in late 2007 it became a [[left liberal]] and [[centrist]] magazine.&lt;ref name=ejc/&gt;&lt;ref name=fhouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=euro/&gt;

In 2003 the circulation of ''Mag'' was 17,000 copies, making it the second best-selling weekly in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martine Robinson Beachboard|author2=John C.

{{Campaignbox Mongol invasions}}
The '''Mongol invasion of [[Central Asia]]''' occurred after the unification of the [[Mongol]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes on the [[Mongolia]]n plateau in 1206. It was finally complete when [[Genghis Khan]] conquered the [[Khwarizmian Empire]] in 1221.

==Siberia (1207-1209)==
{{Main article|History of Siberia#Mongol conquest}}
The conquest of the forest peoples of Siberia was carried out in 1207 by Genghis' eldest son, [[Jochi]]. Most of the tribes submitted with little resistance, with the exception of the [[Yenisei Kyrgyz]], who had defeated an expeditionary force in 1204, and took several years to subdue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Siberia|author=Igor V. Naumov|date=22 Nov 2006|accessdate=27 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of Tuva|Tuva]] was conquered in 1207.

==Uyghurs, Qarluqs and Qara Khitai (1216-1218)==
{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai}}
The [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], [[Karluks|Qarluqs]] and local [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Tajik people|Tajik]] peoples submitted to the Mongolians.  The Uyghur state of [[Gaochang|Kara-Khoja]] was a vassal of the [[Qara Khitai]], but in 1210, the Uyghur ruler of Kara-Khoja, [[Baurchuk Art Tekin|Idiqut Barchuq]] appeared before the Khan to declare his allegiance to the Mongolians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of Inner Asia |author=Svatopluk Soucek |chapter=Chapter 4 - The Uighur Kingdom of Qocho |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-65704-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was rewarded with the daughter of Genghis in marriage, and the Uyghurs served under the Mongols as bureaucrats.  A leader of the [[Karluks|Qarluq]] and Buzar, the [[warlord]] of [[Chuy Valley]], followed the Uyghur example.

The [[Qara Khitai]] (Black Khitan) were [[Khitans]] of the [[Liao Dynasty]] (907–1125) who were driven out of China by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jurchens]] of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]].  In 1124 some [[Khitans]] moved westward under [[Yelü Dashi|Yeh-lü Ta-shih]]’s leadership and created the [[Qara Khitai Khanate]] (Western Liao) between in the [[Semirechye]] and the [[Chu River]].  They dominated Central Asia in the 12th century after they defeated the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Great Seljuk]] leader [[Ahmed Sanjar]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] in 1141.  However, their power was shattered in 1211 through the combined actions of the [[Khwārezm-Shah]] [[ʿAlāʾ ad-Dīn Muḥammad]] (1200–20), and [[Küchlüg]], a fugitive [[Naimans|Naiman]] prince in flight from [[Genghis Khan]]’s [[Mongols]]. Kuchlug was given shelter by the Qara Khiitai, but he usurped the [[Gurkhan]]'s throne in 1211.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Biran, Michal. |title=The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Chapter 3 - The Fall: between the Khwarazm Shah and the Mongolians |year=2005 |pages=60–90 |isbn= 0-521-84226-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuchlug attacked the city of [[Almaliq, Xinjiang|Almaliq]], and the Qarlugs there who were vassals of the Mongols appealed to Genghis Khan for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of Inner Asia |author=Svatopluk Soucek |chapter=Chapter 6 - Seljukids and Ghazvanids |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-65704-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1216, Genghis dispatched his general [[Jebe]] to pursue Kuchlug. The Mongols defeated the Qara Khitai at [[Balasaghun]], Kuchlug fled, but was later killed in 1218.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Biran, Michal. |title=The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |pages=84–85 |isbn= 0-521-84226-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Khwarezmia (1219-1221)==
{{Main|Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia}}
{{Campaignbox Mongol Invasion of the Khwarezmian Empire}}
The Mongols' original conquest of all "people in felt tents", unifying the nomadic tribes in Mongolia and then the [[Turkmen people|Turcomen]]s and other nomadic peoples,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} had come with relatively little bloodshed, and almost no material loss. It was not originally the intention of the [[Mongol Empire]] to invade the [[Khwarezmid Empire]], and according to [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvaini]], Genghis Khan had originally sent the ruler of the Khwarezmid Empire, [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Sultan Muhammad Aladdin]], a message seeking trade and greeted him as his neighbor: "I am master of the lands of the rising sun while you rule those of the setting sun. Let us conclude a firm treaty of friendship and peace." or he said "I am Khan of the lands of the rising sun while you are sultan those of the setting sun: Let us conclude a firm agreement of friendship and peace."&lt;ref&gt;Ratchnevsky, Paul. ''Genghis Khan: His Life and Legacy'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Governor of Otrar refused to receive the mission and had all 450 of them killed, with permission from the Sultan. Upon hearing of this atrocity months later, Genghis Khan flew into a rage and used the incident as a pretext for invasion. The Mongol invasion of Central Asia however would entail the utter destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire along with the massacre of much of the civilian population of the region. According to Juvaini, the Mongols ordered only one round of slaughter in Khwarezm and Transoxiana, but systematically exterminated a particularly large portion of the people of the cities of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. This earned the Mongols a reputation for bloodthirsty ferocity that would mark the remainder of their campaigns.

During the invasion of Transoxania in 1219, along with the main Mongol force, Genghis Khan used a Chinese specialist catapult unit in battle. They were used again in 1220 in Transoxania. The Chinese may have used the [[catapults]] to hurl [[gunpowder]] bombs, since they already had them by this time &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esnWJkYRCJ4C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=transoxania+chinese+gunpowder+catapult&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pvLTTs3XH8Ho0QH866g4&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=transoxania%20chinese%20gunpowder%20catapult&amp;f=false |title=Firearms: a global history to 1700   |author=Kenneth Warren Chase|accessdate=2011-11-28  |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |date= |year=2003 |month= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=0-521-82274-2 |page=58 |pages= |quote=Chinggis Khan organized a unit of Chinese catapult specialists in 1214, and these men formed part of the first Mongol army to invade Transoania in 1219. This was not too early for true firearms, and it was nearly two centuries after catapult-thrown gunpowder bombs had been added to the Chinese arsenal. Chinese siege equipment saw action in Transoxania in 1220 and in the north Caucasus in 1239-40. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Genghis Khan was conquering Transoxania and Persia, several Chinese who were familiar with gunpowder were serving with Genghis's army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgQXAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Though+he+was+himself+a+Chinese,+he+learned+his+trade+from+his+father,+who+had+accompanied+Genghis+Khan+on+his+invasion+of+Muslim+Transoxania+and+Iran.+Perhaps+the+use+of+gunpowder+as+a+propellant,+in+other+words+the+invention+of+true&amp;dq=Though+he+was+himself+a+Chinese,+he+learned+his+trade+from+his+father,+who+had+accompanied+Genghis+Khan+on+his+invasion+of+Muslim+Transoxania+and+Iran.+Perhaps+the+use+of+gunpowder+as+a+propellant,+in+other+words+the+invention+of+true&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TgfUTtqlEZLD0AHC95QD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA|title=The Mongol Warlords: Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan, Hulegu, Tamerlane  |author1=David Nicolle |author2=Richard Hook |accessdate=2011-11-28  |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |date= |year=1998 |month= |publisher=Brockhampton Press |location= |language= |isbn=1-86019-407-9 |page=86 |pages= |quote=Though he was himself a Chinese, he learned his trade from his father, who had accompanied Genghis Khan on his invasion of Muslim Transoxania and Iran.

The '''NHL Winter Classic''' is one of the three series of [[NHL outdoor games|regular season outdoor games]] played in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and is distinct from the league's other two series, the [[NHL Heritage Classic]] and the [[NHL Stadium Series]]. The Winter Classic is annually held on or around [[New Year's Day]], generally in a [[American football|football]] or [[baseball]] stadium, in an area with a resident NHL team. The [[2008 NHL Winter Classic|first Winter Classic]] was held in [[2007-08 NHL Season|2008]] at the venue then known as [[New Era Field|Ralph Wilson Stadium]] (now New Era Field) in [[Orchard Park, New York]], between the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. A total of ten have been held. The most recent game was played during [[2017–18 NHL season|2017–18 season]] at [[Citi Field]], in Queens, New York on January 1, 2018 between the [[New York Rangers]] and [[Buffalo Sabres]]. The Rangers won 3-2 in overtime.

After the success of the [[Cold_War_(ice_hockey)|Cold War]] at Michigan State University in 2001 and the [[2003 Heritage Classic]], the NHL's first regular season outdoor game, the league inaugurated the Winter Classic in 2008. It eventually caught on as an annual tradition for the league, suspending only in 2013 due to [[2012–13 NHL lockout]]. The [[2014 NHL Winter Classic|2014 game]] between the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and the [[Detroit Red Wings]] set a new NHL attendance record of 105,491. The Winter Classic has been contested only in the United States, while the [[NHL Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]] has been held exclusively in Canada. The Winter Classic featured only American teams for its first five games, until the Maple Leafs' appearance in 2014.

Along with the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]], the Winter Classic is considered one of the NHL's premier events; with matchups generally booked to showcase the league's most popular teams and players, the event garners the league its highest attendance and among its highest television ratings. The event is typically promoted as a return to the sport's outdoor roots, meant to evoke memories of [[pond hockey]]. Its popularity has led to the scheduling of additional outdoor hockey games, both in the NHL and other leagues worldwide. In May 2014, the ''[[Sports Business Journal|SportsBusiness Journal]]'' and ''[[SportsBusiness Daily]]'' named the Winter Classic its "Sports Event of the Year," the second time in five years the Classic has won that distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2014/05/22/nhl-wins-big-at-sportsbusiness-journal-awards/ |title=NHL wins big at SportsBusiness Journal Awards |author= Tucker, Cam |date= May 22, 2014 |work= |publisher= nbcsports.com |accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:NHL Winter Classic 2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ralph Wilson Stadium (now [[New Era Field]]), near Buffalo, during the first Winter Classic in [[2008 NHL Winter Classic|2008]]]]
The Winter Classic as a television event was presented by NBC Sports Executive VP Jon Miller. He pitched the idea to the NHL in 2004 "but they didn't find the concept workable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wyshynski|first=Greg|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/Chatting-with-NBC-Sports-executive-producer-Sam-?urn=nhl-298773|title=Chatting with NBC Sports executive producer Sam Flood about Winter Classic, cable cam for hockey, Mike Milbury and HBO '24/7'|date=December 21, 2010|accessdate=January 3, 2016|publisher=Yahoo Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, Miller found an ally in then Executive VP/Business &amp; Media John Collins, who embraced the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brink|first=Bill|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10360/1113401-61.stm|title=Winter Classic is a cool concept|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=December 26, 2010|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowbiggen|first=Bruce|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/bruce-dowbiggin/nhl-finds-its-signature-moment/article1853685/|title=How hockey found its signature moment|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=December 30, 2010|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2008 NHL Winter Classic|first Winter Classic]] was held January 1, 2008, between the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] at [[New Era Field|Ralph Wilson Stadium]] in [[Orchard Park (town), New York|Orchard Park, New York]]. The game had a then-NHL-record crowd of 71,217 fans in attendance. The success of the 2008 NHL Winter Classic led the NHL to schedule a [[2009 NHL Winter Classic|second one for 2009]], held at [[Wrigley Field]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], on January 1, 2009, matching the [[Detroit Red Wings]] against the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. That game had the highest American television ratings of any hockey game in 33 years.

The [[2010 NHL Winter Classic|third Winter Classic]] was held at [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], on January 1, 2010, featuring the [[Boston Bruins]] and the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. The result was a 2–1 overtime win for Boston, the first home team to win a Winter Classic. The 2011 game was played at [[Heinz Field]] in [[Pittsburgh]], between the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and the [[Washington Capitals]] with Washington winning 3–1.

The fifth Winter Classic was held at [[Citizens Bank Park]] in [[Philadelphia]], on January 2, 2012, featuring the [[New York Rangers]] and the [[Philadelphia Flyers]]. The result was a 3–2 win for New York.
 
Weather has proven to affect the game, with the 2011 and 2012 classics being delayed due to rain and other weather. Outdoor effects of wind and sun glare may give an unfair advantage to one team, so the NHL sometimes modifies the third and overtime periods. In this case, play is stopped at the midway point and teams switch directions. This option was exercised in 2008, 2011, 2014 and 2018. The 2008, 2014 and 2018 games also featured the teams switching ends halfway through the five-minute sudden-death overtime period for the same reason. In the 2008 and 2014 the games went into a shootout, where both goaltenders alternated defending the same goal, rather than the normal practice of defending opposite goals.

The Winter Classic was made a part of the NHL schedule through at least January 1, 2021, as part of the league's television contract, initially with NBC and [[NHL on Versus|Versus]], then just NBC after [[Comcast]] (the parent company of [[NBC Sports Network|Versus]]) [[Comcast NBC merger|bought NBC]] and merged Versus into the [[NBC Sports]] banner.

The 2012 Winter Classic in Philadelphia was not played on New Year's Day, as that fell on a Sunday in 2012 and conflicted with the NFL's final week of regular season games. Instead, following precedent set by college football's [[bowl game]]s (which move their games to Monday when January 1 lands on Sunday),{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} and to prevent a weather delay from pushing into the timeslot for ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'', the game took place on January 2, 2012. The game was played at Citizens Bank Park, home of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. Neighboring [[Lincoln Financial Field]], home of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], reportedly was preferred, but as the Eagles hosted a home game on January 1, the NHL could not undertake the required week-long renovations needed to construct the outdoor playing arena. The New York Rangers defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 3–2.

The sixth Winter Classic was scheduled for [[Michigan Stadium]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] in 2013, with the Detroit Red Wings hosting the Toronto Maple Leafs in an [[Original Six]] matchup. However, the [[2012–13 NHL lockout]] disrupted the season, leading to the game's cancellation on November 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=644824|title=NHL announces cancellation of 2013 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic &amp; SiriusXM Hockeytown Winter Festival|date=November 2, 2012|accessdate=January 3, 2016|publisher=NHL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matchup was rescheduled for the 2014 Winter Classic, at the same venue with the same participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=664500&amp;navid=nhl:topheads|title=2014 NHL Winter Classic will match Wings and Leafs|date=April 7, 2013|accessdate=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time a Canadian team participated in the Winter Classic. An NHL-record total of 105,491 tickets were sold, greater than the [[Guinness World Records]]-certified world-record attendance of 104,173 at [[The Big Chill at the Big House]], also held at Michigan Stadium.&lt;ref name="2014PreliminaryAttendance"&gt;{{cite web |last = Austin |first = Kyle |title = Did the Winter Classic set a world record for hockey attendance?

The seventh Winter Classic was announced on September 21, 2013 when [[Washington Capitals]] owner [[Ted Leonsis]] announced the 2015 Winter Classic would be hosted by his franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = LeBrun | first = Pierre | title = Capitals get 2015 Winter Classic | publisher = ESPN.com | date = September 21, 2013 | url = http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/9697171/washington-capitals-host-winter-classic-new-year-day-2015 | accessdate = January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 22, 2014, the NHL announced the Capitals would play the [[Chicago Blackhawks]].&lt;ref name="2014-15_Schedule"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=723369 | title=Winter Classic, rivalries highlight 2014-15 schedule | publisher=NHL.com | accessdate=June 22, 2014 | date=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 2014, the NHL announced the game would be played at [[Nationals Park]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitalstoday.monumentalnetwork.com/2014/09/10/nationals-park-to-host-capitals-vs-blackhawks-in-2015-bridgestone-nhl-winter-classic |title=Nationals Park to Host Capitals vs. Blackhawks in 2015 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic |date=September 10, 2014 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eighth Winter Classic was announced on January 24, 2015 at an [[2015 NHL All-Star Game|All Star Game]] press conference when the NHL announced that the [[2016 Winter Classic|Winter Classic]] would return to [[Massachusetts]], with the Boston Bruins hosting the [[Montreal Canadiens]] at [[Gillette Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts|Foxborough]].&lt;ref name=NHL24Jan15&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masisak|first1=Corey|title=National Hockey League announces 2016 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic and two 2016 Coors Light NHL Stadium Series Games|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=750092|website=NHL.com|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=January 24, 2015|date=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2016, the Montreal Canadiens won the 2016 Winter Classic by defeating the Boston Bruins 5–1.&lt;ref name="Habs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/canadiens-beat-bruins-in-2016-bridgestone-nhl-winter-classic/|title=Canadiens beat Bruins in 2016 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic|date=January 1, 2016|accessdate=January 2, 2016|publisher=Sportsnet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Montreal Canadiens were welcomed with the return of [[Brendan Gallagher]], who had missed 17 games due to broken fingers that required surgery, and managed a goal and an assist, earning him the first star of the game.&lt;ref name=Habs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/recap?id=2015020565|title=Canadiens' depth defeats Bruins at Winter Classic|last=Rosen|first=Dan|date=January 1, 2016|accessdate=January 1, 2016|publisher=NHL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ninth Winter Classic was announced on March 9, 2016 when the NHL announced that the [[2017 NHL Winter Classic|Winter Classic]] would come to [[Missouri]], with the [[St. Louis Blues]] hosting the Chicago Blackhawks at [[Busch Stadium]] in [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref name=WinterClassic2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinkert|first=Chris|title=Winter Classic Comes to St. Louis in 2017|url=http://blues.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=872921|website=Blues.NHL.com|publisher=NHL Enterprises, L.P.|accessdate=March 21, 2017|location=[[St. Louis]]|date=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Winter Classic was the second of two outdoor games to be held over the New Year's weekend in 2017, with the [[NHL Centennial Classic]] being held in [[Toronto]] on January 1 and the Winter Classic following on January 2. The St. Louis Blues defeated the Chicago Blackhawks by the score of 4–1, scoring 3 goals in the third period. The Chicago Blackhawks are the only team to lose 3 times in the Winter Classic.

To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first Winter Classic, the NHL announced on May 10, 2017 that the Buffalo Sabres would take part in the 2018 game against the New York Rangers at [[Citi Field]]. Due to a 1982 agreement with New York City and state tax laws that give their home arena [[Madison Square Garden]] tax-exempt status, the Rangers must not "cease playing" home games at MSG (which is generally interpreted as meaning playing a home game at any other venue), and thus a [[legal fiction]] was constructed so that the Rangers host the game as the away team. The arrangement gives the Sabres only 40 games for the 2017–18 season in their home city of Buffalo, while the Rangers receive 42 games (not counting away games against the [[New York Islanders]]) in New York City. Similar legal fictions had been employed for the Rangers in the 2014 Stadium Series and the [[2011 NHL Premiere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/sports/hockey/rangers-on-road-in-the-bronx-money-may-be-why.html |title=Rangers on Road in the Bronx?

On November 18, 2017, the NHL announced that the Chicago Blackhawks would take part in a fourth Winter Classic as they will host the Boston Bruins on January 1, 2019. It will be the Bruins third participation to the event. The game will be played at [[Notre Dame Stadium]], [[Indiana]], marking the first time that the game is not played in the same state or media market the host team (the stadium is located less than 100 miles from Chicago but is served by television stations in [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] instead of Chicago)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/2019-winter-classic-bruins-blackhawks-announced/c-293098132|title=Blackhawks, Bruins to face off in 2019 Winter Classic|author=|date=|website=NHL.com|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

**Toronto Maple Leafs: Toronto's uniforms were royal blue and white and featured the distinct striping configuration inspired by the 1930s Maple Leafs. The front crest of the jersey featured a distinct wordmark from the inaugural Maple Leafs' logo, revealed in 1927.

**Montreal Canadiens: Montreal's jerseys were based on the one they wore for the 1924-1925 season. Having won the Stanley Cup the precedent season, the first in the team's history as a member of the NHL, the team put a globe with the word "Champions" under it. Since 1922, the team was using their classic CH logo with inverted colors (the C in white and the H in red): that logo was moved on both arms for the 1924-1925 season. For the Winter Classic, the CH logo was put back as the team's crest while the globe moved on the arms. As for the jersey's colors, they traded place from the original version, the red becoming white and the white becoming red, similar to a jersey worn by the team between 1944 and 1947.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/12/28/bruins-and-canadiens-weave-history-into-winter-classic-jerseys/D34uQ4vTJl8SDyR8JYuvEI/story.html|title=Bruins and Canadiens weave history into Winter Classic jerseys|accessdate=August 28, 2016|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Boston Bruins: Boston also used a jersey based on the one they wore for the 1924-1925 season, their first in the NHL. The jersey is identical to the one used that season, except for the fact that it is black instead of brown as it originally was.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"/&gt;

The throwback sweaters are very popular with fans, and teams have often continued to wear them after the Winter Classic. The Penguins and Blackhawks made their Winter Classic sweaters their alternates the following season. The Flyers went a step further and made their 2010 Winter Classic sweaters their permanent road sweaters, beginning with 2010–11. The Sabres had already been using a variation of their throwback sweater prior to their appearance (that particular season, there were no third sweaters anywhere in the league) and adopted a slightly updated version of the sweaters as their main uniform in 2010–11, while the 2011 contestants, the Penguins and Capitals, wore their classic uniforms as third jerseys in [[2011-12 NHL season|2011–12]]. The Capitals continued to do so through the 2014–15 season, the same year the Flyers adopted their 2012 Winter Classic sweaters as their third jerseys.

==Impact==
The Winter Classic has proven to be a ratings success for the league in the United States and is regularly the league's most watched regular season contest (in the US), rivaling the ratings for the [[Stanley Cup]]. Its popularity in the United States led to the [[American Hockey League]] adopting a similar contest in 2010, the [[AHL Outdoor Classic]], which it has reprised each year since. Both the Winter Classic and the earlier Cold War contest helped repopularize outdoor hockey at the [[college ice hockey|college and university level]], and several college organizations, minor and junior hockey leagues hold outdoor games each year.

Despite the overwhelming popularity of the original Heritage Classic between the Montreal Canadiens and the Edmonton Oilers in 2003, the popularity of the Winter Classic in Canada is not as high as it is in the United States. On Canada's [[CBC Television]] network, the Winter Classic has lower ratings than its weekly regular season telecasts ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''. This has been attributed to the lack of Canadian teams in any of the Winter Classics and has led to both the revival of the all-Canadian [[NHL Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]] and the scheduling of the Maple Leafs in the 2014 Winter Classic and the Canadiens in the 2016 edition.

''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' columnist [[Dan Shaughnessy]] said of the new Winter Classic, "[N]ow hockey owns New Year's Day the way baseball owns the Fourth of July and [[American football on Thanksgiving|football owns Thanksgiving]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/dan_shaughnessy/12/28/winter.classic/index.html#ixzz0xaK9kuBq|title=NHL's Winter Classic makes every New Year's Day a hockey day|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=December 28, 2009|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 game===
The [[2014 NHL Winter Classic|2014 Winter Classic]] between the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] had an NHL-record paid attendance of 105,491, and a television viewership in the U.S. and Canada of 8.2 million television viewers, a North American record for a regular season game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shea|first=Bill|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20140102/NEWS/140109988/nhl-winter-classic-at-big-house-hits-record-for-tickets-ratings|title=NHL Winter Classic at Big House hits record for tickets, ratings|publisher=Crain’s Detroit Business|date=January 2, 2014|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sportsnet's Chris Johnston said, "The feeling when the players walked into the 87-year-old stadium in front of more than 100,000 fans was truly something special. The biggest and best Winter Classic of them all lived up to its advanced billing." The game went down to the wire, ending in a 3-2 Toronto victory in a shootout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportstalkflorida.com/2014-nhl-winter-classic-recap/#vslKtOEKAQk5oPiB.99 "2014 NHL Winter Classic Recap"], "Sports Talk Florida," January 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV Ratings in the U.S.==
The Winter Classic games usually rank among the most watched regular season NHL games on NBC reacquiring the rights to the NHL in 2005. Early entries in the Winter Classic ranked among the highest ratings for professional hockey in the United States since the 1970s, prior to that, the highest rating for an NHL game since then had been [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s final game, which aired on [[NHL on Fox|Fox]] in 1999. Winter Classic viewership peaked in 2011 and, with the exception of a bump in 2014, has been in persistent decline since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic by the numbers|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=746430|website=NHL.com|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future sites==
{{main|List of stadiums in the United States}}
Due to the popularity of the event, every NHL team has requested to participate in the Winter Classic either as the host or the visiting team. Numerous locations have been mentioned in the media as potential sites for future Winter Classics or entries in the [[NHL Stadium Series]], including [[Michie Stadium]], [[FedExField]], [[Ohio Stadium]], motorsports venues such as the currently under construction [[Canadian Motor Speedway]] in [[Fort Erie, Ontario]], and even non-sports venues like the [[National Mall]] or [[Central Park]].&lt;ref name=2018wcreport&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/hockey/rangers/2018-nhl-winter-classic-likely-to-be-held-at-citi-field-with-rangers-vs-sabres-sources-say-1.13268887|title=2018 NHL Winter Classic likely to be held at Citi Field with Rangers vs. Sabres, sources say|first=Arthur|last=Staple|work=Newsday|date=March 15, 2017|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/DC-Winter-Classic-Coming-to-the-District-112610134.html |title=Winter Classic Coming to the District? |publisher=NBC Washington |date=December 29, 2010 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Larry|last1=Brooks|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/more_sports/where_next_how_about_central_park_LPysyHzAWgMKtKHtxpuzSL |title=How about Central Park for next Winter Classic? |publisher=NYPOST.com |date=January 2, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csnphilly.com/01/03/11/Winter-Classic-Headed-to-Central-Park/landing_word_hockey.html?blockID=383827&amp;feedID=4682 |title=Winter Classic Headed to Central Park? |publisher=Csnphilly.com |date=January 3, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wyshynski |first=Greg |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/The-top-30-future-locations-for-NHL-Winter-Class?urn=nhl-211938 |title=The top 30 future locations for NHL Winter Classic games - Puck Daddy - NHL - Yahoo!

Any future additional Winter Classic games in [[Pittsburgh]] would have to be held at [[PNC Park]] due to scheduling logistics with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], who for the 2011 game requested to the NFL to play Week 16 on [[Thursday Night Football|Thursday night]] and Week 17 on the road in order to give the NHL time to get [[Heinz Field]] ready for the game. (Indeed, work started immediately after the Steelers finished their Thursday night game against the [[Carolina Panthers]], as NFL players were still coming off the field when work started on converting the field.) Both PNC Park and Heinz Field would be available, however, for a [[NHL Stadium Series|Stadium Series]] game (Heinz Field eventually hosted the [[2017 NHL Stadium Series|2017 Stadium Series game]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2016/02/05/Pittsburgh-Penguins-Philadelphia-Flyers-reportedly-working-on-home-and-home-series-of-outdoors-games/stories/201602050250|title=Penguins, Flyers planning home-and-home series of outdoors games|author=|date=|website=post-gazette.com|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility for the Penguins, Flyers or Sabres (Pegula is a prominent Penn State alumnus who has hosted an annual exhibition game at Penn State's [[Pegula Ice Arena|indoor hockey arena]] since 2016) would be [[Beaver Stadium]] on the campus of [[Penn State University]], located between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carchidi|first=Sam|title=Flyers vs. Penguins match at Beaver Stadium in works|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-06-07/sports/39791240_1_peter-luukko-twitter-broadstbull-beaver-stadium|work=[[Philly.com]]|publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] and the [[Boston Bruins]] have explored the possibility of asking the NHL to schedule the 2024 Winter Classic at [[Harvard Stadium]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] to coincide with the Boston franchise's 100th anniversary year. If awarded the 2024 Winter Classic, the Bruins are expected to ask the NHL to again have the [[Montreal Canadiens]] as the opposition.

The 2019 Winter Classic will be held at [[Notre Dame Stadium]] in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], with the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] as host team, playing against the [[Boston Bruins]]. Sites for Winter Classic games after 2019 have yet to be determined.

The '''Nine Power Treaty Conference''' or '''Brussels Conference''' was convened in late October 1937 as a meeting for the signatories of the [[Nine Power Treaty]] to consider "peaceable means" for hastening the end of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|renewed conflict]] between [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] and [[Japanese Empire|Japan]], that had broken out in July. This Conference was held in accordance with a provision of the Nine Power Treaty of 1922.  The actual conference was held in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], from November 3 to 24, 1937.

==Background==
Japanese diplomatic isolation and souring of the Japan–U.S. relationship became significant because of the expansion of the [[Second Sino–Japanese War]] in July 1937. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] appealed to the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty to help resist Japanese aggression. Japan refused to participate in the Conference, maintaining that its dispute with China was outside the purview of the Nine-Power Treaty. Germany also refused to participate.

==Convening of the conference==

On November 3, the Conference finally opened in [[Brussels]]. While the Western powers were in session to mediate the situation, the Chinese troops were making their final stand in Shanghai and had all hopes for a western intervention that would save China from collapse.  However, the Conference dragged on with little progress.

==Posture of the United States==
President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Secretary [[Cordell Hull|Hull]] gave instructions to [[Norman H. Davis]], the U.S. delegate to the conference, stating that the first objective of the foreign policy of the United States was national security, and that consequently the U.S. sought to keep peace and promote the maintenance of peace; that it believed in cooperative effort for the preservation of peace by pacific and practicable means; that this country as a signatory to the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] had renounced war as an instrument of national policy; and that "public opinion in the United States has expressed its emphatic determination that the United States keep out of war". Mr. Davis was instructed to keep in mind the interest of the United States in peace in the Pacific and in the Far East as evidenced by the [[Washington Naval Conference]], the statements relating to foreign policy made by the President in his Chicago address of October 5, and this Government's statement of October 6 on the controversy between China and Japan. In the view of this Government the primary function of the Conference was "to provide a forum for constructive discussion, to formulate and suggest possible bases of settlement, and to endeavor to bring the parties together through peaceful negotiation".

It was emphasized to Davis that if the U.S. were to avoid an ultimate serious clash with Japan, some practical means must be found to check Japanese conquest and to make effective the collective will of the powers which desired the settlement of international controversies by peaceful means; that the Conference might be an agency for bringing to bear upon Japan every moral pressure directed toward bringing about a change in Japanese attitude and policy.    Finally, Davis was instructed to "observe closely the trend of public opinion in the United States and take full account thereof".

==November 15 declaration==

On November 15, the Conference adopted a declaration affirming that the representatives of 15 states considered the conflict between China and Japan to be of concern to all countries parties to the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. In the    presence of this difference between the views of the Conference and the Japanese Government, the Conference considered that there was no opportunity at the time for carrying out its terms of reference so far as they related to bringing about peace by agreement.

==Conclusion of conference==

On November 24, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference convened for the last time and then adjourned indefinitely, without producing any measures that would stop Japanese aggression.  At this point, the Washington System had completely collapsed.

In a declaration, dated November 24, 1937, the Conference stated that it strongly reaffirmed the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty; that it believed that a satisfactory settlement between China and Japan could not be achieved by direct negotiation between the parties to the conflict alone and that an acceptable agreement could be achieved only by consultation with other powers principally concerned; that it strongly urged that hostilities be suspended and resort be had to peaceful processes; that the Conference deemed it advisable temporarily to suspend its sittings; that the conflict remained, however, a matter of concern to all the powers assembled at Brussels; and that the Conference would be called together again when it was considered that deliberations could be advantageously resumed.

The United States delegate reported at the conclusion of the Conference that it had demonstrated the "unwillingness of Japan to resort to methods of conciliation" and that the Japanese continued to insist that the issues between Japan and China were exclusive to those two countries whereas the Conference powers, with the exception of Italy, affirmed that the situation was of concern to all members of the family of nations.

In his report, General [[Chen Cheng]] wrote that throughout much of the Shanghai campaign, sound military strategy was often supplanted by political strategy. It was the nation's tragedy that political strategy, especially the one as precarious as the hope for foreign intervention, forced the troops to make exorbitant sacrifices in Shanghai and led almost to total annihilation. He wrote that because China was weak, it was in dire need of foreign help and had to sacrifice just to prove its capacity to fight and will to resist. By the end of the battle, even though hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops died just to make the point that China was ready to sacrifice, the final hope for a western intervention never materialized.

The '''Northern Crusades'''&lt;ref name=Christiansen&gt;{{cite book|last=Christiansen|first=Erik|title=The Northern Crusades|year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|page=287|isbn=0-14-026653-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Baltic Crusades'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunyadi|first=Zsolt|author2=József Laszlovszky |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity|year=2001|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|page=606|isbn=963-9241-42-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; were [[religious wars]] undertaken by [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christian]] [[Military order (society)|military order]]s and kingdoms, primarily against the [[paganism|pagan]] [[Balts|Baltic]], [[Baltic Finns|Finnic]] and [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] peoples around the southern and eastern shores of the [[Baltic Sea]], and to a lesser extent also against [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[Orthodox Slavs|Slavs]] ([[East Slavs]]). The crusades took place mostly in the 12th and 13th centuries and resulted in the subjugation and forced [[baptism]] of [[indigenous peoples]]. 

The most notable campaigns were the [[Livonian Crusade|Livonian]] and [[Prussian Crusade|Prussian]] crusades. Some of these wars were called crusades during the Middle Ages, but others, including most of the [[First Swedish Crusade|Swedish ones]], were first dubbed crusades by 19th-century [[romantic nationalism|romantic nationalist]] historians. However, crusades against northern pagans were authorized by [[Pope Alexander III]] in the bull ''Non parum animus noster'', in 1171 or 1172 &lt;ref&gt; Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 71&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Background==
The official starting point for the Northern Crusades was [[Pope Celestine III]]'s call in 1195,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Tyerman, ''God's War: A New History of the Crusades'', (University of Harvard Press, 2006), 488.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Catholic kingdoms of [[Scandinavia]], [[Poland]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] had begun moving to subjugate their pagan neighbors even earlier.&lt;ref name=ResearchGate&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235718803_Poland_and_the_papacy_before_the_second_crusade |title=Poland and the papacy before the second crusade |first=Darius|last=von Güttner-Sporzyński |publisher=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-Christian people who were objects of the campaigns at various dates included:
* the [[Polabians|Polabian Wends]], [[Sorbs]], and [[Obotrites]] between the [[Elbe]] and [[Oder]] rivers (by the [[Saxons]], [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], and [[Poles]], beginning with the [[Wendish Crusade]] in 1147)
* the [[Finns proper]] in 1150s in the [[First Swedish Crusade|First Crusade]] by the Swedes; by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] in 1191 and 1202; [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]] in 1249 in the [[Second Swedish Crusade|Second Crusade]] by the Swedes; and [[Finnish Karelia|Karelia]] in 1293 in the [[Third Swedish Crusade|Third Crusade]] by the Swedes; [[Christianization]] in these areas had started earlier.
* [[Livonians]], [[Latgallians]], [[Selonians]], and [[Estonians]] (by the [[German people|Germans]] and [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], 1193–1227).
* [[Semigallians]] and [[Curonians]] (1219–1290).
* [[Old Prussians]].
* [[Lithuanians]] and [[Samogitians]] (by the [[Germans]], unsuccessfully, 1236–1316).

{{Scandinavia map, 1219}}
Armed conflict between the [[Baltic Finns]], [[Balts]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] who dwelt by the Baltic shores and their [[Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] neighbors to the north and south had been common for several centuries before the crusade. The previous battles had largely been caused by attempts to destroy castles and sea trade routes and gain economic advantage in the region, and the crusade basically continued this pattern of conflict, albeit now inspired and prescribed by the [[Pope]] and undertaken by Papal knights and armed monks.

==Wendish Crusade==
{{main article|Wendish Crusade}}
The campaigns started with the 1147 [[Wendish Crusade]] against the [[Polabian Slavs]] (or "[[Wends]]") of what is now northern and eastern [[Germany]]. The crusade occurred parallel to the [[Second Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]], and continued irregularly until the 16th century.

==Swedish Crusades==
{{main article|First Swedish Crusade|Second Swedish Crusade|Third Swedish Crusade}}
The Swedish crusades were campaigns by Sweden against [[Finns]], [[Tavastians]], and [[Karelians]] during period from 1150 to 1293.

== Danish Crusades ==
[[The Danes]] are known to have made two crusades to Finland in 1191 and in 1202. The latter one was led by the Bishop of Lund [[Anders Sunesen]] with his brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muinaisuutemme jäljet|last=Georg Haggren, Petri Halinen, Mika Lavento, Sami Raninen ja Anna Wessman|first=|publisher=Gaudeamus|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=380|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Livonian Crusade==
{{main article|Livonian Crusade}}
By the 12th century, the peoples inhabiting the lands now known as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania formed a pagan wedge between increasingly powerful rival Christian states – the [[Orthodox Church]] to their east and the [[Catholic Church]] to their west. The difference in creeds was one of the reasons they had not yet been effectively converted. During a period of more than 150 years leading up to the arrival of [[Germans|German]] crusaders in the region, Estonia was attacked thirteen times by Russian principalities, and by Denmark and Sweden as well. Estonians for their part made raids upon Denmark and Sweden. There were peaceful attempts by some Catholics to convert the Estonians, starting with missions dispatched by [[Adalbert of Hamburg|Adalbert]], Archbishop of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]] in 1045-1072. However, these peaceful efforts seem to have had only limited success.

===Campaign against the Livonians (1198–1212)===
Moving in the wake of German merchants who were now following the old trading routes of the [[Vikings]], a monk named [[Saint Meinhard|Meinhard]] landed at the mouth of the [[Daugava River|Daugava river]] in present-day Latvia in 1180 and was made bishop in 1186. Pope [[Celestine III]] proclaimed a crusade against the Baltic heathens in 1195, which was reiterated by Pope [[Innocent III]] and a crusading expedition led by Meinhard's successor, Bishop [[Berthold of Hanover]], landed in Livonia (part of present-day Latvia, surrounding the [[Gulf of Riga]]) in 1198. Although the crusaders won their first battle, Bishop Berthold was mortally wounded and the crusaders were repulsed.

In 1199, [[Albert of Buxhoeveden]] was appointed by the Archbishop [[Hartwig of Uthlede|Hartwig II]] of Bremen to Christianise the Baltic countries. By the time Albert died 30 years later, the conquest and formal Christianisation of present-day Estonia and northern Latvia was complete. Albert began his task by touring the Empire, preaching a Crusade against the Baltic countries, and was assisted in this by a [[Papal Bull]] which declared that fighting against the Baltic heathens was of the same rank as participating in a crusade to the [[Holy Land]]. Although he landed in the mouth of the Daugava in 1200 with only 23 ships and 500 soldiers, the bishop's efforts ensured that a constant flow of recruits followed. The first crusaders usually arrived to fight during the spring and returned to their homes in the autumn. To ensure a permanent military presence, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] were founded in 1202. The founding by Bishop Albert of the market at [[Riga]] in 1201 attracted citizens from the Empire and economic prosperity ensued. At Albert's request, Pope Innocent III dedicated the Baltic countries to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] to popularize recruitment to his army and the name "Mary's Land" has survived up to modern times. This is noticeable in one of the names given to Livonia at the time, [[Terra Mariana]] (Land of Mary).

[[File:Sigulda Totale.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of the castle in [[Sigulda]]]]

In 1206, the crusaders subdued the Livonian stronghold in [[Turaida]] on the right bank of [[Gauja]] River, the ancient trading route to the [[Northwestern Rus]]. In order to gain control over the left bank of Gauja, the stone castle was built in [[Sigulda]] before 1210. By 1211, the Livonian province of [[Metsepole]] (now [[Limbaži district]]) and the mixed Livonian-Latgallian inhabited county of Idumea (now [[Straupe]]) was converted to the Roman Catholic faith. The last battle against the Livonians was the siege of Satezele hillfort near to Sigulda in 1212. The Livonians, who had been paying tribute to the East Slavic Principality of [[Polotsk]], had at first considered the Germans as useful allies. The first prominent Livonian to be christened was their leader [[Caupo of Turaida]]. As the German grip tightened, the Livonians rebelled against the crusaders and the christened chief, but were put down. Caupo of Turaida remained an ally of the crusaders until his death in the [[Battle of St. Matthew's Day]] in 1217.&lt;ref name="CHR"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmJnyTlis7oC&amp;printsec |title=The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1961 |isbn=0-231-12889-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German crusaders enlisted newly baptised Livonian warriors to participate in their campaigns against [[Latgallians]] and [[Selonians]] (1208–1209), [[Estonians]] (1208–1227) and against [[Semigallians]], [[Samogitians]] and [[Curonians]] (1219–1290).

===Campaign against the Latgallians and Selonians (1208–1224)===
After the subjugation of the Livonians the crusaders turned their attention to the Latgallian principalities to the east, along the Gauja and [[Daugava River|Daugava]] rivers. The military alliance in 1208 and later conversion from [[Greek Orthodoxy]] to [[Roman Catholicism]] of the Principality of [[Tālava]] was the only peaceful subjugation of the Baltic tribes during the Nordic crusades. The ruler of Tālava, [[Tālivaldis]] (''Talibaldus de Tolowa''), became the most loyal ally of German crusaders against the Estonians, and he died a Catholic martyr in 1215. The war against the Latgallian and Selonian countries along the Daugava waterway started in 1208 by occupation of the Orthodox Principality of [[Koknese]] and the Selonian [[Sēlpils hillfort]]. The campaign continued in 1209 with an attack on the Orthodox Principality of [[Jersika]] (known as ''Lettia''), accused by crusaders of being in alliance with Lithuanian pagans. After defeat the king of Jersika, [[Visvaldis]], became the vassal of the Bishop of Livonia and received part of his country (Southern [[Latgale]]) as a fiefdom. The Selonian stronghold of Sēlpils was briefly the seat of a [[Selonian diocese]] (1218–1226), and then came under the rule of the Livonian Order (and eventually the stone castle of [[Selburg]] was built in its place). Only in 1224, with the division of Tālava and [[Adzele]] counties between the Bishop of Rīga and the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Order of the Swordbearers]], did Latgallian countries finally become the possession of German conquerors. The territory of the former Principality of Jersika was divided by the Bishop of Rīga and the Livonian Order in 1239.

===Campaign against the Estonians (1208–1224)===
[[File:Kuressaare linnus (vaade hoovist).jpg|thumb|right|[[Kuressaare Castle]], Estonia, constructed by the Teutonic Order]]
By 1208, the Germans were strong enough to begin operations against the Estonians, who were at that time divided into eight major and several smaller counties led by elders with limited co-operation between them. In 1208-27, war parties of the different sides rampaged through the Livonian, Northern Latgallian, and Estonian counties, with Livonians and Latgallians normally as allies of the Crusaders, and the Principalities of [[Polotsk]] and [[Pskov]] appearing as allies of different sides at different times. Hill forts, which were the key centres of Estonian counties, were besieged and captured a number of times. A truce between the war-weary sides was established for three years (1213–1215) and proved generally more favourable to the Germans, who consolidated their political position, while the Estonians were unable to develop their system of loose alliances into a centralised state. The Livonian leader [[Kaupo]] was killed in battle near [[Viljandi]] (Fellin) on 21 September 1217, but the battle was a crushing defeat for the Estonians, whose leader [[Lembitu]] was also killed. Since 1211, his name had come to the attention of the German chroniclers as a notable Estonian elder, and he had become the central figure of the Estonian resistance.

The Christian kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden were also greedy for conquests on the Eastern shores of the Baltic. While the Swedes made only [[Battle of Lihula|one failed foray]] into western Estonia in 1220, the Danish Fleet headed by King [[Valdemar II]] of Denmark had landed at the Estonian town of Lindanisse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://runeberg.org/salmonsen/2/7/0518.html |title=Estland |work=Salmonsens konversationsleksikon|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; (present-day [[Tallinn]]) in 1219. After the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]] the Danes established a fortress, which was besieged by Estonians in 1220 and 1223, but held out. Eventually, the whole of northern Estonia came under [[Danish Estonia|Danish control]].

===Wars against Saaremaa (1206–61)===
The last Estonian county to hold out against the invaders was the island county of [[Saaremaa]], whose war fleets had raided Denmark and Sweden during the years of fighting against the German crusaders.

In 1206, a Danish army led by king [[Valdemar II]] and [[Anders Sunesen|Andreas, the Bishop of Lund]] landed on Saaremaa and attempted to establish a stronghold without success. In 1216 the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] and the bishop Theodorich joined forces and invaded Saaremaa over the frozen sea. In return the Oeselians raided the territories in Latvia that were under German rule the following spring. In 1220, the Swedish army led by king [[John I of Sweden]] and the bishop [[Karl Magnusson (Bjälboätten)|Karl of Linköping]] conquered [[Lihula]] in [[Rotalia]] in Western Estonia. Oeselians attacked the Swedish stronghold the same year, conquered it and killed the entire Swedish garrison including the Bishop of Linköping.

In 1222, the Danish king [[Valdemar II]] attempted the second conquest of Saaremaa, this time establishing a stone fortress housing a strong garrison. The Danish stronghold was besieged and surrendered within five days, the Danish garrison returned to [[Tallinn|Revel]], leaving bishop [[Albert of Riga]]'s brother Theodoric, and few others, behind as hostages for peace. The castle was razed to the ground by the Oeselians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNBNHgAACAAJ&amp;dq |title=The Baltic Crusade |first=William L. |last=Urban |publisher=Lithuanian Research and Studies Center |year=1994 |pages=113–114 |isbn=0-929700-10-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 20,000 strong army under Papal legate [[William of Modena]] crossed the frozen sea while the Saaremaa fleet was icebound, in January 1227. After the surrender of two major Oeselian strongholds, [[Muhu]] and [[Valjala]], the Oeselians formally accepted Christianity.

In 1236, after the defeat of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in the [[Battle of Saule]], military action on Saaremaa broke out again. In 1261, warfare continued as the Oeselians had once more renounced Christianity and killed all the Germans on the island. A peace treaty was signed after the united forces of the [[Livonian Order]], the [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]], and [[Danish Estonia]], including mainland Estonians and Latvians, defeated the Oeselians by conquering their stronghold at Kaarma. Soon thereafter, the [[Livonian Order]] established a stone fort at [[Pöide Parish|Pöide]].

===Wars against the Curonians and Semigallians (1201–90)===
Although the [[Curonians]] had attacked Riga in 1201 and 1210, [[Albert of Riga|Albert of Buxhoeveden]], considering Courland a tributary of [[Valdemar II of Denmark]], had been reluctant to conduct a large scale campaign against them. After Albert's death in 1229, the crusaders secured the peaceful submission of Vanemane (a county with a mixed Livonian, [[Oselia]]n, and Curonian population in the northeastern part of Courland) by treaty in 1230. In the same year the papal vice-legat Baldouin of Alnea annulled this agreement and concluded an agreement with the ruler of [[Bandava]] in the central Courland Lamekins (''Lammechinus rex''), delivering his kingdom into the hands of the papacy. Baldouin became the popes's delegate in Courland and bishop of Semigallia; however, the Germans complained about him to the [[Roman Curia]], and in 1234 Pope [[Gregory IX]] removed Baldouin as his delegate.

After their decisive defeat in the [[Battle of Saule]] by the Samogitians and Semigallians, the remnants of the Swordbrothers were reorganized in 1237 as a subdivision of the [[Teutonic Order]], and became known as the [[Livonian Order]]. In 1242, under the leadership of the master of the Livonian Order [[Andrew of Groningen]], the crusaders began the military conquest of Courland. They defeated the Curonians as far south as [[Embūte]], near the contemporary border with Lithuania, and founded their main fortress at [[Kuldīga]]. In 1245 Pope Innocent IV allotted two thirds of conquered Courland to the Livonian Order, and one third to the [[Bishopric of Courland]].

At the [[Battle of Durbe]] in 1260 a force of Samogitians and Curonians overpowered the united forces of the Livonian and Teutonic Orders; over the following years, however, the Crusaders gradually subjugated the Curonians, and in 1267 concluded the peace treaty stipulating the obligations and the rights of their defeated rivals. The unconquered southern parts of their territories (Ceklis and Megava) were united under the rule of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

[[File:2010 09 04 7Tervete37.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Tērvete castle hill in 2010.]]

The conquest of Semigallian counties started in 1219 when crusaders from Rīga occupied [[Mežotne]], the major port on the [[Lielupe]] waterway, and founded the [[Bishopric of Semigallia]]. After several unsuccessful campaigns against the pagan Semigallian duke [[Viestards]] and his Samogitian kinsfolk, the [[Roman Curia]] decided in 1251 to abolish the Bishopric of Semigallia, and divided its territories between the Bishopric of Rīga and the Order of Livonia. In 1265 a stone castle was built at [[Jelgava]], on the Lielupe, and became the main military base for crusader attacks against the Semigallians. In 1271 the capital hillfort of [[Tērvete]] was conquered, but Semigallians under the Duke [[Nameisis]] rebelled in 1279, and the Lithuanians under [[Traidenis]] defeated Livonian Order forces in the [[Battle of Aizkraukle]]. Duke Nameisis' warriors unsuccessfully attacked Rīga in 1280, in response to which around 14,000 crusaders besieged Turaida castle in 1281. To conquer the remaining Semigallian hillforts the Order's master [[Villekin of Endorpe]] built a castle called ''Heiligenberg'' right next to the Tērvete castle in 1287. The same year the Semigallians made another attempt to conquer Rīga, but again failed to take it. On their return home Livonian knights attacked them, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Garoza]], in which the Orders' master Villekin and at least 35 knights lost their lives. The new master of the Order [[Cuno of Haciginstein]] organised the last campaigns against the Semigallians in 1289 and 1290; the hillforts of [[Dobele]], [[Rakte]] and [[Sidarbe]] were conquered and most of the Semigallian warriors joined the Samogitian and Lithuanian forces.

==Prussia and Lithuania==
{{Main article|Prussian Crusade}}

===Campaigns of Konrad of Masovia===
[[Konrad I of Masovia|Konrad I]], the Polish Duke of [[Masovia]], unsuccessfully attempted to conquer [[Prussia (region)|pagan Prussia]] in crusades in 1219 and 1222.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewinski-Corwin|first=Edward Henry|authorlink=Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin|title=A History of Prussia|publisher=The Polish Book Importing Company|location=New York|year=1917|page=628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the advice of the first Bishop of Prussia, [[Christian of Oliva]], Konrad founded the crusading [[Order of Dobrzyń]] (or ''Dobrin'') in 1220. However, this order was largely ineffective, and Konrad's campaigns against the [[Old Prussians]] were answered by incursions into the already captured territory of Culmerland ([[Chełmno Land]]). Subjected to constant Prussian counter-raids, Konrad wanted to stabilize the north of the Duchy of Masovia in this fight over border area of Chełmno Land. Masovia had only been conquered in the 10th century and native Prussians, [[Yotvingians]], and Lithuanians were still living in the territory, where no settled borders existed. Konrad's military weakness led him in 1226 to ask the Roman Catholic monastic order of the [[Teutonic Knights]] to come to Prussia and suppress the Old Prussians.

===Teutonic Order===
{{Main article|Lithuanian Crusade|Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights}}

The Northern Crusades provided a rationale for the growth and expansion of the [[Teutonic Order]] of [[Germans|German]] crusading [[knights]] which had been founded in Palestine at the end of the 12th century. Due to [[Islam|Muslim]] successes in the Holy Land, the Order sought new missions in Europe. Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]] in west-central [[Poland]] appealed to the Knights to defend his borders and subdue the pagan [[Prussian people|Baltic Prussians]] in 1226. After the subjugation of the Prussians, the Teutonic Knights fought against the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

When the Livonian knights were crushed by Samogitians in the [[Battle of Saule]] in 1236, coinciding with a series of revolts in Estonia, the Livonian Order was inherited by the Teutonic Order, allowing the Teutonic Knights to exercise political control over large territories in the Baltic region. [[Mindaugas]], the King of Lithuania, was baptised together with his wife after his coronation in 1253, hoping that this would help stop the Crusaders' attacks, which it did not. The Teutonic Knights failed to subdue pagan Lithuania, which officially [[Christianization of Lithuania|converted to (Catholic) Christianity]] in 1386 on the marriage of Grand Duke [[Jogaila]] to the 11-year-old Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland]]. However, even after the country was officially converted, the conflict continued up until the 1410 [[Battle of Grunwald]], also known as the [[First Battle of Tannenberg]], when the Lithuanians and Poles, helped by the Tatars, Moldovans and the Czechs, defeated the Teutonic knights.

The Teutonic Order's attempts to conquer [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russia]] (particularly the Republics of [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] and [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]]), an enterprise endorsed by [[Pope Gregory IX]],&lt;ref name=Christiansen/&gt; accompanied the Northern Crusades. One of the major blows for the idea of the conquest of Russia was the [[Battle of the Ice]] in 1242. With or without the Pope's blessing, Sweden also undertook several [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars|crusades against Orthodox Novgorod]].

'''Operation Cycle''' is the name of the evacuation of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops from [[Le Havre]], in the [[Pays de Caux]] of Upper Normandy from {{nowrap|10–13 June}} 1940, towards the end of the [[Battle of France]], during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The operation was preceded by the better known rescue of {{nowrap|338,226 British}} and French soldiers from [[Dunkirk]] in [[Operation Dynamo]] {{nowrap|(26 May – 4 June).}} On 20 May, the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Germans]] had captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the Somme and cut off the main Allied armies in the north. South of the river, the Allies improvised defences and made local counter-attacks, to dislodge the Germans from [[bridgehead]]s on the south bank and re-capture river crossings for an advance northwards to regain contact with the armies in northern France and Flanders.

The [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] arrived in France from 15 May, without artillery and short of units that had been diverted to Calais. The division joined the large number of lines-of-communication troops south of the Somme, many of whom were hurriedly organised into the [[Beauman Division]] and other improvised units, despite a lack of training and weapons. French troops were sent into the area, as [[Army general (France)|Général d'armée]] [[Maxime Weygand]] attempted to build up a defence in depth on the south bank of the Somme and make bigger attacks to eliminate the German bridgeheads. From {{nowrap|27 May – 4 June,}} about half of the German bridgehead south of Abbeville was recaptured by Franco-British troops; the Allies were reinforced by infantry divisions and the [[4e Division cuirassée|''4e'' Division ''cuirassée'']] (4e DCr, Colonel [[Charles De Gaulle]]) but lost many of their tanks and the Germans much of their infantry, some units running back over the [[Somme (river)|river Somme]].

When ''[[Fall Rot]]'' (Case Red), the final German offensive, began on 5 June, the [[9th Army Corps (France)|IX Corps]] of the [[Tenth Army (France)|French Tenth Army]] (including the [[51st (Highland) Division|51st (Highland) Infantry Division]] (Major-General [[Victor Fortune]]) of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) after it arrived from the Saar on 28 May), was pushed back to the [[Bresle (river)|Bresle River]]. On 9 June, German tanks entered [[Rouen]] on the Seine, cutting off the IX Corps from the [[10th Army Corps (France)|X Corps]] to the east and from the Seine to the south. The French and British commanders in the pocket decided to make for Le Havre and Fortune detached [[Arkforce]], the equivalent of two brigades, to guard the routes back to the port. During the night of {{nowrap|9/10 June,}} the remainder of the Highland Division and the French divisions of IX Corps, prepared to continue the retreat but found that the [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th ''Panzer'' Division]] (''[[Generalmajor]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]]) had advanced from Rouen through Yvetot to [[Cany-Barville|Cany]] and [[Veulettes-sur-Mer]] on the [[Durdent (river)|Durdent river]].

With an Allied withdrawal to Le Havre cut off, the Highlanders and the French retreated to [[Saint-Valery-en-Caux|St Valery-en-Caux]], where from {{nowrap|10–11 June,}} {{nowrap|2,137 British}} and {{nowrap|1,184 French}} soldiers were rescued by the Navy. The remainder, including over 6,000 Highlanders, were taken prisoner on 12 June. At Le Havre, from 10 to 13 June, {{nowrap|11,059 British}} troops from Arkforce, other British units in the port and Allied forces were evacuated; attempts by the Franco-British to prepare a ''[[national redoubt]]'' in [[Brittany]] came to nothing. Operation Cycle was followed by [[Operation Ariel]] from 14 to 25 June, in which another {{nowrap|191,870 soldiers}} were embarked from [[Cherbourg]], [[St. Malo]] and other Atlantic and Mediterranean ports, until the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]].

==Background==

===Battle of France===

{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}

On 10 May 1940, the Germans began ''[[Fall Gelb]]'' an offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, [[Army Group A]] (''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]) broke through the French [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth Army]] (General [[André Corap]]) in the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley, led by [[1st Panzer Army|''Panzergruppe Kleist'']] made up of the [[XIX Armee Korps|XIX ''Armeekorps'']] under ''Generalleutnant'' [[Heinz Guderian]] and the [[XXXXI Panzer Corps|''XLI Armee Korps'']] under ''Generalleutnant'' [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]. On 20 May, the Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]], cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium. The [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]], a Franco-British counter-attack on 21 May, led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the channel ports, rather than advance southwards over the Somme.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=279}} Apprehension about another Franco-British counter-attack led to the ''Arras halt order'' being issued by the German higher commanders on 21 May. The neighbouring XV Corps (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) was held back in reserve and a division of the XLI ''Korps'' was moved eastwards, when the corps was only {{convert|50|km|mi|order=flip}} from Dunkirk.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227–228}}

===British lines-of-communication===

{{see also|Beauman Division}}

[[File:Bassin de la Somme.svg|thumb|{{centre|The Somme Valley}}]]
Allied forces north of the Somme were cut off by the German advance to St. Omer and Boulogne on the night of {{nowrap|22/23 May,}} which isolated the BEF from its supply ''[[entrepôts]]'' at [[Cherbourg]] in the Cotentin peninsula, [[Brittany]] and [[Nantes]]. The [[Pays de Caux]], the coastal area between the Somme and the Seine, was known as the Northern District ([[Acting (rank)|Acting]] Brigadier [[Archibald Bentley Beauman|A. B. Beauman]]) on the BEF lines-of-communication, with the Dieppe and Rouen districts as sub-areas.{{efn|The ''Pays de Caux''  in [[Normandy]] occupies most of the [[France|French]] ''[[département in France|département]]'' of [[Seine Maritime]] in [[Haute-Normandie]]. It is a [[chalk]] [[plateau]] to the north of the Seine [[Estuary]], extending to the [[cliff]]s on the [[English Channel]] coast, that are known as the [[Côte d'Albâtre]].}} Dieppe was the main medical base of the BEF and Le Havre the principal supply and ordnance source. From [[Saint-Saëns, Seine-Maritime|St. Saëns]] to [[Buchy, Seine-Maritime|Buchy]], north-east of Rouen, lay the main BEF ammunition depot and its infantry, machine-gun and base depots were at Rouen, [[Évreux]] and [[Saint-Aubin-Épinay|L'Epinay]]. A main railway line linking the bases and connecting them with bases further west in Normandy and with the BEF in the north, ran through Rouen, Abbeville and Amiens. Beauman was responsible for base security and guarding {{nowrap|13 airfields}} being built for the RAF, with troops drawn from the [[Royal Engineers]], [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], [[Royal Corps of Signals]] and older garrison troops.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=252–253}}

Below the Seine in the Southern District, were three Territorial divisions and the 4th Border Regiment, 4th Buffs and the 1st/5th Sherwood Forester lines-of-communication battalions, which were moved into the Northern District on 17 May as a precaution.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=252–253}} Rail movements between these bases and the Somme quickly became difficult, due to congestion and German bombing, the trains from the north mainly carrying Belgian and French troops and the roads filling with retreating troops and refugees. Beauman lost contact with the BEF GHQ and was also unable to discover if Allied troops were going to dig in on the Somme or further south. On 18 May, Major-General [[Philip de Fonblanque]], commanding the lines-of-communication troops, ordered Beauman to prepare defences in the Northern District. Beauforce was improvised from the 2nd/6th East Surrey of the 12th (Eastern) Division, 4th Buffs, four machine-gun platoons and the 212th Army Troops Company RE.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=253–254}}

'Vicforce (Colonel C. E. Vickary) took over five provisional battalions created from reinforcement troops in infantry and general base depots, which held plenty of men but few arms and little equipment.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=253–254}} Beauforce was sent to Boulogne on 20 May by road but the Germans had already cut off the port and it returned to the 12th (Eastern) Division near Abbeville. When German troops captured Amiens on 20 May and then began patrolling south of the river, their appearance caused panic and alarmist rumours, in the absence of reliable information. Beauman ordered the digging of a defence line along the [[Andelle]] and [[Béthune (river)|Béthune]] rivers, the most effective tank obstacles south of the [[Bresle (river)|Bresle]] river, to protect Dieppe and Rouen against an attack from the east. Bridges were prepared for demolition and obstacles placed on the approaches.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=253–254}}

===Battle of Abbeville===
{{main|Battle of Abbeville}}

On 20 May, the 2nd ''Panzer'' Division advanced {{convert|90|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} to Abbeville on the [[English Channel]], overran the [[25th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|25th Infantry Brigade]] of the [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]] and captured the town at {{nowrap|8:30 p.m.}} Only a few British survivors managed to retreat to the south bank of the Somme. At {{nowrap|2:00 a.m.}} on 21 May, the III Battalion, Rifle Regiment 2 reached the coast, west of [[Noyelles-sur-Mer]]. The [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] (Major-General R. Evans) had arrived in France from 15 May without artillery, short of an armoured regiment and the infantry of the Support Group, which had been diverted to Calais. From {{nowrap|4 June – 4 July}} the Franco-British forces south of the Abbeville bridgehead, held by the German 2nd ''Panzer'' Division, then the 57th Infantry Division, recaptured about half of the area; the Allied forces lost many of their tanks and the Germans much of their infantry, some units running back over the [[River Somme]]. On 5 June, the German 4th Army attacked out of the remains of their bridgeheads south of the Somme and the Franco-British divisions opposite, drastically depleted by their counter-attacks of the previous four weeks, were pushed back to the Bresle with many casualties.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=80–81, 85, 272–273}}{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=274}}

==Prelude==

===Allied defensive preparations===

[[File:Cartenormandie2.PNG|thumb|{{centre|Normandy}}]]
The French armies and the "2nd BEF" were operating on interior lines and were closer to their bases and supplies. About {{nowrap|112,000 French}} troops from Dunkirk had returned to France via the ports of Normandy and Brittany and the {{nowrap|100,000 British}} troops in the area had been reinforced by about {{nowrap|60,000 fighting}} troops from England. The French had also managed to replace many of their tank and other armoured vehicle losses for the ''1e'' and ''2e'' DCr (heavy armoured divisions) and the ''4e'' DCr had its losses replaced and French morale experienced something of a revival by the end of May.{{sfn|Alexander|2007|pp=225–226}}

Most French soldier replacements had not experienced the débâcle in the north and officers returned from Dunkirk had gained tactical experience against German mobile units and discovered that tank-for-tank, French vehicles were superior to their German equivalents, having thicker armour and better guns; the French artillery had also performed well.{{sfn|Alexander|2007|p=227}} From {{nowrap|23–28 May,}} the Seventh Army and the Tenth Army (General [[Robert Altmayer]]) were rebuilt and Weygand adapted to German tactics with [[defence in depth]] and delaying tactics, to inflict maximum attrition on German units. Villages, towns and cities were fortified for all-round defence, to serve as hedgehogs with the new infantry, armoured and half-mechanised divisions held back, ready to counter-attack and relieve surrounded units, which were to hold out at all costs.{{sfn|Alexander|2007|pp=231, 238}}

===German offensive preparations===

{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France}}

On 21 May, Colonel General [[Franz Halder]], the Chief of the [[Oberkommando des Heeres]] (OKH) General Staff, submitted to Hitler ''[[Fall Rot]]'' (Case Red), a campaign plan for the final defeat of France, which after amendment was adopted on 31 May. On 5 June, [[German Army Group A|Army Group A]] was to attack either side of Paris towards the Seine and the main attack by [[German Army Group B|Army Group B]] (Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]]) was to begin the main attack east of Paris on 9 June towards Rheims and then after about a week, [[Army Group C]] (Colonel General [[Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb|Wilhelm von Leeb]]) was to attack through the [[Maginot Line]] and the Upper Rhine. The three army groups would then converge on the [[Côte-d'Or|Plateau de Langres]] south-east of Paris and on the rear of the Maginot Line. Army Group B had {{nowrap|36 infantry,}} one cavalry, four motorised infantry, six ''panzer'' divisions and two motorised infantry brigades. Army Group A had {{nowrap|39 infantry,}} two motorised infantry and four ''panzer'' divisions. The [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]], [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] and [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]] were controlled by Army Group B and the [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd Army]], [[12th Army (Wehrmacht)|12th Army]] and [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|16th Army]] by Army Group A; the [[18th Army (Wehrmacht)|18th Army]] (General [[Georg von Küchler]]) with four divisions, was to remain at Dunkirk. Army Group C had {{nowrap|24 infantry}} divisions and {{nowrap|22 infantry}} divisions were held in OKH reserve. Seven divisions were left in eastern Germany and seven garrisoned Norway.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=237–238}}

The motorised infantry and ''panzer'' divisions were concentrated into two groups of two corps each, [[2nd Panzer Army|''Panzergruppe Guderian'']] in Army Group A and ''Panzergruppe Kleist'' (General [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]]) in Army Group B along with the [[XV Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XV Corps]]. The plan was based on the traditional concept of ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' (annihilation theory) in which {{lang|de|Bewegungskrieg}} ([[Maneuver warfare|battles of manoeuvre]]) would lead to the encirclement and destruction of the opposing armies. The ''panzer'' groups were not to be used in independent operations but subordinated to the armies, despite having the same size and importance. ''Panzergruppe Guderian'' came under the 12th Army (Colonel General [[Wilhelm List]]), ''Panzergruppe Kleist'' the 6th Army (Colonel General [[Walter von Reichenau]]) and XV Corps under the 4th Army (Colonel General [[Günther von Kluge]]). Despite protests from Guderian, List planned the attack over the Aisne as an infantry operation, with the ''panzer'' divisions held back to exploit the breakthrough. Extensive redeployments were necessary and ''Panzergruppe Guderian'' moved {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} to its start line, after travelling {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} during the drive to Dunkirk, the troops beginning to show great tiredness and the vehicles wear and tear.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=238–239}} The ''Luftwaffe'' made strategic attacks from {{nowrap|1–4 June}} (towards the end of the Dunkirk evacuation), against the Parisian aircraft industry and fuel dépôts around Marseilles, then resumed close support operations for the army for ''Fall Rot''. (After the occupation of the capital on 14 June, ''Luftwaffe'' operations concentrated on the [[Channel Ports]] south of the Somme and the Atlantic ports, towards which the BEF was retreating.){{sfn|Air|2001|p=72}}

====4th Army plan====
On the German right flank, against the French Tenth Army, the 4th Army of Army Group B was to attack with the 5th ''Panzer'' Division, 7th ''Panzer'' Division, the 57th Infantry Division, 31st Infantry Division, 12th Infantry Division, 32nd Infantry Division, 27th Infantry Division, 46th Infantry Division and the 6th Infantry Division and the [[2nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Motorised Division]], the 11th Motorised Brigade and the 1st Cavalry Division. Advancing on a line from Abbeville to Amiens, with a flank guard on the left facing Paris, the main force was to make for the lower Seine, quickly to capture Le Havre and bridgeheads at [[Rouen]], [[Les Andelys]] and [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]]. An advance beyond the Seine to the south or south-west was to wait on events.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=275}}

==''Fall Rot''==

===5 June===
{{see also|Beauman Division}}

[[File:Plan région Abbeville Amiens.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Relief map of the Somme valley near Abbeville}}]]
On 5 June, ''Fall Rot'' (Case Red), a German offensive to complete the defeat of France began and Army Group A attacked either side of Paris towards the Seine.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=237–238}} The 4th Army offensive on the Somme began at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.}} opposite the 51st (Highland) Division at St. Valery sur Somme. German infantry moved forward against Saigneville, [[Mons-Boubert|Mons]], Catigny, [[Pendé]], [[Tilloy-Floriville|Tilloy]] and Sallenelle held by the 7th and 8th battalions, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] (Argyll), as other troops passed between them, the villages being too far apart for mutual support. Saigneville, Mons, Catigny, Pendé and Tilloy fell late in the afternoon and the 7th Argyll were surrounded at [[Franleu]], by troops infiltrating between Mons and [[Arrest, Somme|Arrest]]. The 4th Black Watch in reserve, were ordered forward to relieve Franleu but were stopped by German troops at [[Feuquières, Oise|Feuquières]] and an Argyll company sent forward was surrounded at the edge of Franleu. By dark, the remnants of the 154th Infantry Brigade had been pushed back to a line from [[Woincourt]] to [[Eu, Seine-Maritime|Eu]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=271–272}}{{efn|The 7th Argyll commander sent out most of the wounded and others by lorry that evening and the rest were overwhelmed later on; the Argyll company held on for {{nowrap|24 hours}} before being overrun.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=271–272}}}}

On the right, the 153rd Infantry Brigade was bombed by [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] dive-bombers along with the mortar and artillery-fire used on the rest of the front. The German infantry pushed the battalion back to [[Tœufles]], [[Zoteux]] and Frières, where British machine-gun and artillery fire stopped the advance. The French [[31st (Alpine) Division (French Army)|31st (Alpine) Division]] was forced back parallel to the British from [[Limeux, Somme|Limeux]] to Limercourt and [[Béhen]], with the 152nd Infantry Brigade on the right from [[Oisemont]] to the Blangy–Abbeville road. The [[Lothian and Border Horse|1st Lothian and Border Horse]] at Bray were attacked and fell back east of the village of Oisement. The Composite Regiment had several engagements and had tank losses before rallying at [[Beauchamps, Somme|Beauchamps]] on the Bresle. The 51st Highland and 31st (Alpine) divisions had tried to hold a {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} front and were so depleted after the bridgehead attacks up to 4 June, that the 1st Black Watch had to hold a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} front, in close country. The British troops held on until overwhelmed or retreated under the cover of their artillery, which also held on until the last moment before retiring.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=272–273}}

The 51st (Highland) Division HQ requested air support from the South Component HQ at [[Boos, Seine-Maritime|Boos]] but the three AASF fighter squadrons were down to {{nowrap|18 airworthy}} aircraft and lost another four during the morning. Big ''Luftwaffe'' attacks had been expected on the industrial town of Rouen, a rail and road centre and Anglo-French base of operations; 1 Squadron and French fighters intercepted a raid early in the morning and shot down several aircraft but the remainder got through and bombed Boos aerodrome and an army camp. Another raid in the evening was caught by 501 Squadron but managed to bomb the airfield and camp again, the main bridge, power station, railway and factories. Bombing by the AASF and Bomber Command took place further east and during the night, {{nowrap|103 aircraft}} attacked German communications in France and oil and transport targets in Germany.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=273–274}}

===6 June===

[[File:Bresle Drainage Basin-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Bresle river valley}}]]
During the night, Fortune wrote to Marshall-Cornwall, the War Office liaison officer at the Tenth Army HQ, asking for reinforcements and permission to retreat with the 31st (Alpine) Division to the Bresle but no more troops were left. Marshall-Cornwall prevailed upon Altmayer to agree to a retreat to the Bresle, where the 31st (Alpine) Division would hold from [[Senarpont]] to [[Gamaches]] and the 51st (Highland) Division from there to the sea, a front of {{convert|12.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}. On 6 June, the day passed with German attacks on Oisemont supported by artillery and bombing, that were repulsed by the 1st Lothian and the [[2nd Light Cavalry Division (France)|''2e Division Légère de Cavalerie'']] (2nd DLC, Colonel Berniquet) in a costly defensive success. Attacks further away were repulsed by artillery and small arms fire, except at Beauchamps. Infiltration attempts around Eu and [[Ponts-et-Marais]] were only just repulsed by the Composite Regiment of the 1st Armoured Division.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=275–276}}

The Composite Regiment moved on to Eu and counter-attacked the infiltrations there. Later in the day, the 40th Division moved up beyond the Bresle from Senarpont to [[Aumale]] to reinforce parties of Royal Engineers and an anti-tank battery. During the day, reports arrived that German tanks had broken through on the right, that turned out to be alarmist rumours but the 5th and 7th ''Panzer'' divisions had attacked towards Rouen and their leading elements had got beyond the Poix–Rouen road, with the 2nd Motorised Division following. The 6th Infantry Division was advancing on the German left and the 32nd Infantry Division on the German right was {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} away. The IX Corps position on the Bresle was vulnerable to being cut off in the Havre peninsula. A brigade group of the 52nd (Lowland) Division was due from England on 7 June and the War Office urged the French command to arrange a line of retreat south-east, away from the dead-end of Le Havre, towards the BEF lines of communication south of the Seine.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=275–276}}

Weygand had forbidden a retirement, ordering the Bresle to be held come what may. Earlier, 12 [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheims]] with air cover flew from England to attack German columns moving towards the Somme crossings and lost five aircraft. Later in the day, {{nowrap|24 Blenheims}} bombed bridges and roads from Abbeville to St. Valery-sur-Somme for no loss. Fighters of the AASF patrolled Rouen and during the evening flew sorties over the IX Corps area. In the afternoon, two fighter squadrons had flown from England to Boos airfield, refuelled and patrolled the battlefront but arrived after the German raids on Oisemont and Millebosc. Weygand also appealed for more fighters and the Air Ministry issued warning orders to several squadrons, as {{nowrap|67 Bomber}} Command and {{nowrap|17 AASF}} aircraft raided German communications and oil targets that night.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=276–277}}

===7 June===

[[File:Arques drainage basin-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Arques river and vicinity}}]]
''A'' Brigade of the [[Beauman Division]], with about {{nowrap|3,000 men}} of the 4th Buffs, 1st/5th Sherwood Forester and 4th Border battalions, was sent to reinforce the 51st (Highland) Division (whose 152nd, 153rd and 154th Infantry brigades had suffered {{nowrap|80, 60 and 25 percent}} casualties) and took over on the left; the remnants of the 152nd Infantry Brigade moved into reserve in the ''Haute Forêt d'Eu''.{{sfn|Karslake|1979|p=153}}{{efn|Karslake contradicted the official history total of {{nowrap|900 reinforcements.}}{{sfn|Karslake|1979|p=153}}}} By 7 June, the 51st (Highland) Division had taken up the new position on the Bresle and was in contact with the 31st (Alpine) Division on the right, which reverted to French command. The river made a good defensive position, particularly at the mouth where the banks had been flooded, forming a good tank obstacle and the only vulnerable points were at Eu and Ponts de Marais. During the day, the 4th Border and a company of the 1st/5th Forester attacked the German pocket on the south bank but only managed to push back the Germans to the north-west end of the ''Haute Forêt d'Eu''. The 1st Lothian and the Composite Regiment were moved up as a precaution and for the rest of the day the Allied forces skirmished with the Germans opposite.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=277–278}}

To the south-east, the situation continued to deteriorate and Fortune liaised with the 31st (Alpine) Division, to make sure that the limitations of the Support Group (Brigadier F. E. Morgan), 1st Armoured Division were understood. (The day before, the 1st Armoured Division had come under the command of Almayer at the Tenth Army HQ.) The Support Group was separated from the 51st (Highland) Division by the 31st (Alpine) Division, 40th Infantry Division, the ''2e'' DLC and the ''5e'' DLC. During 7 June, Evans met Marshall-Cornwall and Lieutenant-General [[Henry Pownall]] the former Chief of Staff of the BEF, who was over from England.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=277–278}} It was known by then that the 5th ''Panzer'' Division had broken through the French from [[Grandvilliers, Eure|Grandvilliers]] and [[Formerie]] and overrun British troops south of the Aumale. Other parts of the Support Group on the Aumale–Serqueux front had defeated an attack but the ''panzers'' had then attacked south-west near Forges; the remains of the Support Group were withdrawn into the ''Basse Forêt d'Eu''. The 5th and 7th ''Panzer'' divisions had already outflanked the Bresle line and the 1st Armoured Division units were ordered up to [[Gournay-en-Bray]] to make a flank attack on the German penetration. The division had {{nowrap|41 cruiser}} tanks and {{nowrap|31 light}} tanks in the 3rd Armoured Brigade, six light tanks of [[2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)|Queen's Bays]] and the 10th Royal Hussars mounted in lorries of the 2nd Armoured Brigade, after refitting since the May offensive against the German Somme bridgeheads.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=278}}

During the evening, Général d'armée Maxime Weygand, arrived at the Tenth Army HQ and told the Franco-British officers that the Tenth Army was fighting ''the decisive battle of the war'', that as there were no reserves and all depended on the 1st Armoured Division holding {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} of the Andelle line from Nolleval to Serqueux, as French formations counter-attacked from the south.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=278}} Evans explained that it was a division in name only, its artillery, anti-tank guns and infantry having been detached and that the tanks were not suited to static defence and were already moving up for a counter-attack on the German flank. Weygand was unmoved, only giving permission for the division to retreat over the Seine if it was pushed back from the Andelle. Evans had to countermand the counter-attack, while some units were already engaging the Germans {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} north-west of Gournay. By dawn on 8 June, the ''panzers'' were close to Rouen and IX Corps on the Bresle was on the brink of being cut off.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=278–279}}

===8 June===

====Bresle====
On the Bresle, German troops did little while they waited for the ''panzer'' divisions to envelop the southern flank of the IX Corps defence line. The 4th Border and 1st/5th Forester continued their attempts to expel the Germans from positions in the ''Haute forêt d'Eu'' but only managed to prevent the Germans from taking more ground and there was skirmishing around Beauchamps. At dawn, the German ''panzer'' divisions resumed their attack towards Rouen. By this time the 51st (Highland) Division and the reinforcement of A Brigade from the Beauman Division was holding the line of the Bresle from Gamaches to Eu under the command of the divisional headquarters. The 1st Armoured Division had been broken up as soon as it arrived in France and without the detachments to Calais had taken part in the Allied offensive against the German bridgeheads south of the Somme. Since then, a Composite Regiment from the 2nd Armoured Brigade had remained with the 51st (Highland) Division and was covering the ''Haute forêt d'Eu''. The rest of the 2nd and 3rd Armoured brigades had been reduced by losses to improvised units and held part of the Andelle line from Nolleval to Serqueux and the remnants of the Support Group was in the ''Basse forêt d'Eu'' under the command of the 51st (Highland) Division. B and C brigades of the Beauman Division were defending the Béthune–Andelle line from the Seine to Dieppe.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=279}}{{efn|The 51st (Highland) Division was under the command of General Ihler, IX Corps, Tenth Army, the 1st Armoured Division was under General Altmayer, the Tenth Army commander and also acting on the orders of Weyagand and the Beauman Division was under General Karslake, who answered to General Georges, commander of the French Armies of the North-East. Weygand had told Evans that a retreat should be towards the Seine, not Le Havre and Beauman received similar orders from Karslake but there was no co-ordination between the commands or one commander with authority to begin a general retreat.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=280–281}}}}

====Andelle====
The ''panzer'' divisions attacked at Forges and [[Sigy-en-Bray]], where French refugees and stragglers had been passing through, making it impossible to close the road blocks and a column of French tanks was allowed through, which turned out to be captured vehicles with German crews. The "French" tanks attacked the defences from the rear as the main German force attacked frontally, capturing Serqueux, losing it to a counter-attack and then regaining it. Sigy was bombarded and dive-bombed and the tanks of the 1st Armoured Division and the Beauman Division infantry were pushed back. Further north, Neufchatel was in flames and ''panzers'' reached Mathonville and pressed on towards the Neufchatel to L'Epinay and Rouen road. Earlier, the Composite Regiment in ''Haute forêt d'Eu'' had been ordered back to the 1st Armoured Division to guard the left flank of the defenders on the Andelle line and arrived at L'Epinay at {{nowrap|2:30 p.m.}} but before the regiment could take post, German ''panzers'' and troops arrived on the road from Serqueux, {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} away. For three hours the Composite Regiment resisted German attacks and was then pushed back.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=281}}

The rest of the 5th ''Panzer'' Division had advanced towards Rouen and at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.}} engaged Syme's Battalion at Isneauville, which had been dive-bombed earlier in the day. The battalion, that had been improvised from reinforcement drafts only a week previous, had laid [[Concertina wire|dannert wire]] and planted land-mines and after artillery preparation, resisted for three hours, preventing the Germans from reaching Rouen and claimed many infantry casualties, twelve tanks knocked out, six paratroops, an aircraft and a field gun. The battalion then made a fighting withdrawal to the Seine. During the afternoon and night, the remnants of the 1st Armoured Division and the Beauman Division also retreated over the Seine, which left only the 51st (Highland) Division and part of the Support Group on the north side. Weygand ordered the IX Corps to retreat to Les Andelys and Rouen, which had already fallen. Ihler received the orders as the Tenth Army HQ was out of touch while moving closer to Paris and gave the divisional commanders a retirement programme in which Rouen was to be reached in four days, despite the German spearheads being only four hours from the city.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=281–282}}

====Seine====
On 6 June ''Syme's Battalion'' had arrived comprising soldiers from the base reinforcement depot and the 2nd/4th King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (2nd/4th KOYLI) and 2nd/6th Duke of Wellington's (2nd/6th Duke's) battalions of the 46th Division, that had been recovering since the loss of Abbeville on 20 May, had taken up positions around Rouen, Syme's Battalion with four 2-pounder anti-tank guns and a machine-gun platoon around [[Isneauville]], the 2nd/4th KOYLI on a bridge over the Seine and the 2nd/6th Duke's along the railway south of Boos. The Beauman Division had little artillery and its ill-equipped infantry was dispersed in about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} of ground from the south-east of Rouen on the Seine to St. Vaast on the Béthune and in positions around Rouen. In some places they were close to parties of the 1st Armoured Division and at others with French troops all under separate command, with few means of liaison. Refugees and stragglers on the roads made it impossible to close roads or prevent infiltration and led Beauman to give a general order, that troops were to hold for as long as possible and that brigadiers were to use their discretion, as to when a retreat to the south of the Seine had become necessary. (During the afternoon and night, the last of the 1st Armoured Division and the Beauman Division retreated over the river.){{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=280, 282}}

===9 June===
During the morning, German tanks entered Rouen, to find that French and British troops had left and blown the Seine bridges. IX Corps on the Bresle began to retire as the German armoured forces turned north. Fortune had divided the 51st (Highland) Division to leapfrog backwards; the 153rd Brigade and A Brigade were to retreat to a line from [[Envermeu]] to [[Belleville-sur-Mer]] as the 154th and 152nd Brigades assembled on the Béthune further back. The [[Royal Army Service Corps]] made double trips to move the troops but some took until mid-morning on 9 June, to reach the new positions. (Resistance at two of the Bresle crossings by D Company of the 4th Border and A Company of the 1st/5th Sherwood Forester, which did not receive the retreat order, may have slowed a German follow-up, the two companies holding on for another six days until on 13 June, they realised that hostilities north of the Seine had ended.) The survivors of the Support Group in the ''Basse forêt d'Eu'' joined the remains of the ''2e'' DLC and ''5e'' DLC in ''Forêt d'Eawy''. The Tenth Army HQ has lost contact with IX Corps and the 51st (Highland) Division lost contact with everyone, until a dispatch rider arrived from Le Havre with a message from the British commander in Le Havre, that the [[Port admiral]] had reported that the Germans had reached Rouen. Fortune conferred with Ihler and both agreed to retreat to Le Havre.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=283–284}}

On the night of {{nowrap|9/10 June,}} the rest of the 51st (Highland) Division blew the bridges over the Arques and the [[Eaulne]], where the Germans promptly attacked. The [[Seaforth Highlanders|4th Seaforth]] and the [[Black Watch|1st Black Watch]] managed to hold on, despite attacks at Arques la Bataille and [[Martigny, Seine-Maritime|Martigny]], where the artillery repulsed several German advances. The ''panzer'' divisions had turned north from Rouen towards Dieppe and captured the Arkforce wireless lorry near Carny on the [[Durdent (river)|Durdent]] river at {{nowrap|11:00 a.m.}} The river was the next position the 51st Highland Division was to retire to after dark and a reconnaissance by the 1st Lothian found the Germans on the river crossings at [[Veulettes-sur-Mer]] close to the coast too. German tanks were reported {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} from divisional headquarters that afternoon and rear parties moving westwards preparatory to the retreat that night, ran into German troops. At {{nowrap|5:30 p.m.}} {{HMS|Ambuscade|D38|6}}, part of the destroyer force that had been giving the division fire support for several days, was damaged by German artillery on the cliffs near [[St. Valery-en-Caux]] and {{HMS|Boadicea|H65|6}} was hit while embarking troops from the beach; IX Corps had been cut off from Le Havre.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=285–286}}

==Operation Cycle==

===St. Valery===

Admiral William James, the Commander-in-Chief Portsmouth, had arrived at Le Havre on 10 June, ordered destroyers to reconnoitre the smaller ports to the east and learned of the damage to ''Ambuscade'' and ''Boadicea''; James signalled to the Admiralty that he planned to lift a large number of men from the port and that it must be done that night, if at all.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=230–232}} The retreat to the coast began after dark and the last troops left the Béthune at {{nowrap|11:00 p.m.}} without challenge. Fortune signalled to the War Office that there were two days' rations left and that evacuation from St. Valery to the mouth of the Durdent would be necessary. Units were ordered to dump non-essential equipment and guns were reduced to {{nowrap|100 rounds}} each to make room on the RASC transport for the men. The night move was difficult as French troops, many horse-drawn, encroached on the British route and alarmist rumours spread. Fortune and Ihler set up at a road junction near Veules-les-Roses to direct troops to their positions and by the morning of 11 June, IX Corps had established a defence round St. Valery. French transport continued to arrive at the perimeter and it was difficult in some places to recognise German troops following up, which inhibited defensive fire.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=288}}

[[File:SS Bruges (1920).jpg|thumb|{{centre|Pre-war photograph of {{SS|Bruges|1920|6}}}}]]
That evening, the captain of ''Codrington'' was ordered to begin the evacuation and two hours later, Fortune signalled that it was probably now or never. Troops not needed to hold the perimeter at St. Valery moved down to the beaches and the harbour but no ships arrived, because thick fog prevented them from moving inshore. An armada of {{nowrap|67 merchant}} ships and {{nowrap|140 small}} craft had been assembled but few had wireless and the fog ruined visual signalling; only at [[Veules-les-Roses]] at the east end of the perimeter, were many soldiers rescued, under fire from German artillery, which damaged the destroyers {{HMS|Bulldog|H91|6}}, ''Boadicea'' and ''Ambuscade''. Near dawn, the troops at the harbour were ordered back into the town and at {{nowrap|7:30 a.m.,}} Fortune signalled that it might still be possible to escape the next night, then discovered that the local French commander had negotiated a surrender.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=230–232}}

On 9 June, the French port Admiral at Le Havre sent word to the 10th Army and the 51st Highland Division that the Germans had captured Rouen and were heading for the coast. Ihler, the IX Corps commander and Fortune, decided that the only hope of escape was through Le Havre and abandoned the plan to retire through Rouen. The port admiral requested enough ships from the Admiralty to remove {{nowrap|85,000 troops}} but this contradicted the plans given by Weygand for the IX Corps retirement and Dill hesitated, ignorant that delays in issuing the orders had made the retreat plan impossible. Karslake had also urged several times that the retirement be accelerated but had no authority to issue orders. Only after contacting the [[Richard Howard-Vyse|Howard-Vyse]] Military Mission at Weygand's headquarters, to report the request from the Le Havre port Admiral and then receiving a message during the night from Fortune, that the 51st (Highland) Division was participating in a retreat by IX Corps towards Le Havre, did Dill learn the true situation.{{sfn|Karslake|1979|pp=180–181}}

Fortune detached a force to guard Le Havre comprising the 154th Infantry Brigade, A Brigade of the Beauman Division, two artillery regiments and engineers, named [[Arkforce]] (Brigadier Stanley-Clarke) after the village of [[Arques-la-Bataille]], where it was formed. Arkforce moved on the night of {{nowrap|9/10 June}} towards Fécamp, where most had passed through before the 7th ''Panzer'' Division arrived. A Brigade managed to force its way out but lost the wireless truck intended to keep contact with the 51st (Highland) Division. The possibility of holding a line from Fécamp to Lillebonne was discounted and Stanley-Clarke ordered Arkforce on to Le Havre.{{sfn|Karslake|1979|pp=180–181}} A Royal Navy demolition party had been in Le Havre since late May and the port was severely bombed by the ''Luftwaffe'' on 7 June; two days later, the Admiralty sent orders for an evacuation. Admiral [[William James (Royal Navy officer, born 1881)|William James]], the [[Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth]] sent a [[flotilla leader]], {{HMS|Codrington|D65|6}} across the channel, accompanied by six British and two Canadian destroyers, smaller craft and many Dutch coasters (known as [[schuyt]]s).{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=231, 230}}

A hasty plan was made to block [[Dieppe]] harbour and on 10 June, {{HMS|Vega|L41|6}} (Captain G. A. Garnon-Williams) escorted three [[blockships]] to the port. Two were sunk in the approach channel but the third ship hit a mine just outside, which prevented it being sunk at the entrance to the inner harbour.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=231, 230}} (James had signalled that many IX Corps troops would probably be trapped against the sea near St. Valery, where he had assembled flotillas of smaller craft under the local Senior Naval Officer.){{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=286–287}} Beach parties landed at Le Havre to take control of the evacuation on 10 June and after a 24-hour postponement, the evacuation began on 11 June. The embarkation was hindered somewhat by the damage to the port caused by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing; the troopship {{SS|Bruges|1920|6}}, was hit and beached, the electric power was also cut, rendering the cranes on the docks useless. Ramps were tried for vehicle loading but it was too slow. On 12 June, RAF fighters began patrolling the port and deterred more raids and an attempt was made to save the transport and equipment by diverting it over the Seine via the ferry crossings at Caudebec or the ships at Quillebeuf at the river mouth. The quartermaster of the 14th Royal Fusiliers succeeded in getting the transport away.{{sfn|Karslake|1979|pp=181–182}}

==Aftermath==

===Evacuations===
A total of {{nowrap|2,137 British}} and {{nowrap|1,184 French}} soldiers were lifted from Veules-les-Roses but the remainder, including over {{nowrap|6,000 men}} of the 51st (Highland) Division, were taken prisoner on 12 June by the 7th ''Panzer'' Division (General [[Erwin Rommel]]). The 7th ''Panzer'' Division continued its advance through [[Normandy]] and reached Cherbourg on 18 June.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=286–293}} The greatest number of troops were removed from Le Havre on the night of {{nowrap|12/13 June}} and the evacuation was completed by dawn; of the {{nowrap|11,059 British}} troops evacuated, {{nowrap|9,000 men}} of A Brigade of the Beauman Division were taken to Cherbourg and the 154th Infantry Brigade sailed via Cherbourg to England.{{sfn|Karslake|1979|p=182}}{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=230–231}}

===Analysis===
[[Army Group B]] had attacked either side of Paris with 47 divisions including the majority of the mobile units and for the first 48 hours, the French withstood the German attacks.{{sfn|Healy|2008|p=84}}{{sfn|Alexander|2007|p=248}} The 4th Army captured bridgeheads over the Somme but the attack on the [[Aisne]] failed against the French defence in depth.{{sfn|Alexander|2007|p=245}}{{sfn|Maier|Rohde|Stegemann|Umbreit|1991|p=297}} At [[Amiens]], the Germans were repulsed several times by French artillery fire. Late on the third day of the offensive the Germans managed to cross the Somme and Aisne despite bombing by the [[History of the Armée de l'Air (1909–42)|''Armée de l'Air'']] (French Air Force). The German success was costly and French troops resisted from woods and other cover, where the Germans had broken through.{{sfn|Alexander|2007|p=250}} South of Abbeville, the German XV Corps avoided the woods roads and villages, to move over the slightly undulating country where there were few ditches, the tanks leading and infantry vehicles following.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=276}} The Tenth Army was broken through and retreated to Rouen and southwards along the [[Seine]]. German spearheads were vulnerable to flank attacks but ''Luftwaffe'' operations obstructed French attempts to concentrate and the fear of air attack negated the mass and mobility of the French armies.{{sfn|Alexander|2007|p=240}}

On 6 June, documents recovered from a dead German officer, gave the German programme for {{nowrap|7 and 8 June.}} Beauman, Evans and Marshall-Cornwall discussed the find at the Tenth Army HQ but Karslake was omitted, despite being the senior British officer in France. German forces were to reach the area of Forges-les-Eaux in the area of the Beauman Division and capture Rouen on 8 June. During the meeting, the isolated position of the 51st (Highland) Division and doubts about French assurances, were discussed and the view was taken that the division was doomed. Karslake had already made representations to the CIGS about the lack of unity of command but on 6 June, Dill had written to the Swayne Mission at Georges's HQ that Brooke could be expected the following week and that the 52nd (Lowland) Division was due soon. Dill sent Pownall to France to discuss the new BEF with the French and to liaise with British commanders and Karslake told him that it was vital to withdraw the 51st (Highland) Division before it was too late. Karslake also urged Pownall to get Lieutenant-General [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]] to France and establish a corps headquarters, to unify the command of all British forces, not necessarily under the authority of Altmayer, the Tenth Army commander. Although Brooke had been placed in command of the new BEF on 2 June, he remained in Britain until 12 June, by when the 51st (Highland) Division had been trapped and forced to surrender along with the rest of IX Corps.{{sfn|Karslake|1979|pp=150–154, 188–189}}

===Subsequent operations===

====2nd BEF====

Brooke had returned from Dunkirk on 30 May and on 2 June, was told by Field Marshal [[John Dill]] to go back to France to assemble another BEF, with the 51st (Highland) Division and 1st Armoured Division that were already in France. The [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division|52nd Lowland Division]] and the [[1st Canadian Division]] from Britain, were to be followed by the 3rd Division as soon as it was re-equipped. The [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]] headquarters had been spread around Britain after its return from Dunkirk and his first choice of chief of staff was busy with [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]] the former BEF commander, writing dispatches. Brook warned Dill and the Secretary of State for War, [[Anthony Eden]] that the enterprise was futile, except as a political gesture. Brook was told that on return to France he would come under the authority of Weygand. In France, Fonblanque was still in command of the lines-of-communication troops of the original BEF and lieutenant-generals Henry Karslake and [[James Marshall-Cornwall]] were assisting with command. A [[brigade group]] of the 52nd Lowland Division departed for France on 7 June but Brooke took until 12 June to arrive.{{sfn|Alanbrooke|Danchev|Todman|2002|pp=74–75}}

On 13 June, the RAF made a maximum effort to help the French armies that had been broken through on the Marne. The Germans were across the Seine in the west and the French armies near Paris fell back, dividing the Tenth Army, part on the channel coast and the rest retiring towards Paris. The German advance threatened the airfields of the AASF, which was ordered to retreat towards Nantes or Bordeaux, while supporting the French armies for as long as they kept fighting. The AASF flew armed reconnaissance sorties over the Seine from dawn and German columns were attacked by a force of {{nowrap|10 Battles,}} then a second formation of {{nowrap|15 Battles}} and then {{nowrap|15 Blenheims.}} On the Marne, {{nowrap|12 Battles}} attacked a concentration of German troops and tanks, followed by an attack by {{nowrap|26 Battles,}} which lost six shot down and then a third attack by {{nowrap|15 Blenheims}} from Bomber Command that lost another four. RAF attacks continued through the night, with {{nowrap|44 sorties}} over the Seine, {{nowrap|20 north}} of Paris, {{nowrap|41 on}} the Marne and {{nowrap|59 against}} road and rail communications and against woods reported by the French to be full of German troops. Fighter sorties had been hampered by bad weather and were limited to coastal patrols.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=295}}

Next day attacks resumed against German units south of the Seine but the weather had worsened and fewer sorties were flown. A raid by {{nowrap|24 Blenheims}} with fighter escort was made on [[Merville-Franceville-Plage|Merville]] airfield for a loss of seven aircraft and ten Fighter Command squadrons patrolled twice in squadron strength or provided bomber escorts, in the biggest effort since Dunkirk, as fighters of the AASF patrolled south of the Seine. During the night, {{nowrap|72 bombers}} attacked German marshalling yards, forests and dropped mines in the Rhine, for a loss of two aircraft. The remnants of the 1st Armoured Division and two brigades of the Beauman Division were south of the river, along with thousands of lines-of-communication troops but only the [[157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade]] of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, which had commenced disembarkation on 7 June, engaged in military operations, occupying successive defensive, positions under command of the Tenth Army. The French armies were forced into divergent retreats, with no obvious front line; on 12 June, Weygand had recommended that the French government seek an armistice, which led to the abortive plan to create a defensive zone in Brittany.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=296}}

On 14 June, Brooke was able to prevent the rest of the 52nd (Lowland) Division being sent to join the 157th Infantry Brigade and during the night he was informed that he was no longer under French command and must prepare to withdraw the British forces from France. Marshall-Cornwall was ordered to take command of all British forces under the Tenth Army as [[Norman Force]] and while continuing to co-operate, withdraw towards Cherbourg. The rest of the 52nd (Lowland) Division was ordered back to a defence line near Cherbourg to cover the evacuation on 15 June. The AASF was also directed to send the last bomber squadrons back to Britain and use the fighter squadrons to cover the evacuations. The German advance over the Seine had paused while bridges were built but the advance began again during the day, with the 157th Infantry Brigade engaged east of [[Conches-en-Ouche]] with the Tenth Army. The army was ordered to retreat to a line from Verneuil to Argentan and the Dives river, where the British took over an {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} front, either side of the [[Mortagne-au-Perche]]–[[Verneuil-sur-Avre]] road. German forces followed up quickly and on 16 June, Altmayer ordered the army to retreat into the Brittany peninsula. [[Operation Ariel]], the final Allied evacuation, had begun on 15 June.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=300–302}}

====Breton redoubt====

[[File:Bretagne topographic blank map.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Topographical map of Brittany}}]]
On 29 May, the [[Prime Minister of France]], [[Paul Reynaud]], replied to Weygand, rejecting his recommendation that an armistice be considered and asked him to study the possibility that a ''[[national redoubt]]'' could be established around a naval port in the Brittany peninsula, to retain freedom of the seas and contact with French allies. The idea was discussed by the French and British governments on 31 May and an operational instruction was drawn up on 5 June, in which Lieutenant-General Alan Brook was appointed to command the new BEF ("2nd BEF") being prepared for France. Plan ''W'', the original plan to land the BEF in 1939 was used, with the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division being directed to Cherbourg, to assemble at [[Evreux]], ready to support the [[51st (Highland) Infantry Division]] (major-General [[Victor Fortune]]), north of the Seine. On 6 June, Weygand issued orders to begin work on the redoubt, under the command of General [[René Altmayer]].{{sfn|Karslake|1979|p=264}}{{efn|Brother of Robert the [[Tenth Army (France)|Tenth Army]] commander.{{sfn|Karslake|1979|p=264}}}}

German forces crossed the Seine on 9 June, cutting off the 51st (Highland) Division north of the river, two days after 52nd (Lowland) Division had begun to land and the assembly of the division was changed to [[Rennes]] in Brittany; the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade which arrived first, was directed to Beaumont near [[Le Mans]], the rest of the division to follow on. The 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division began its arrival at Brest on 11 June and was sent to [[Sablé-sur-Sarthe]], on the assumption that two fresh divisions would be enough to allow the Tenth Army and attached British troops to retreat through them and take up positions prepared around the Brest peninsula. That day, the [[Anglo-French Supreme War Council]] met at [[Briare]] and General [[Charles de Gaulle]] (Minister of War) was sent to Rennes to survey progress on the redoubt; on 12 June, De Gaulle reported that [[Quimper]] would be a favourable place for the government to retreat to, since it would be easy to take ship to England or Africa, since the prospect of maintaining a redoubt in Brittany was non-existent.{{sfn|Karslake|1979|p=265}}

Altmayer had reported that work had begun on defences, civilian labour had been recruited and {{nowrap|3,000 Polish}} troops had arrived to begin work, despite a lack of civil engineering machinery. Churchill visited France for the last time on 13 June, met Reynaud and approved the project. Brook had visited the 1st Canadian Division in England to give the gist of the plan and met Weygand and Georges at Briare on 14 June. It was agreed that the plan was futile but the will of the civilian leadership must be respected and a joint agreement was signed. Brook telephoned Dill in London to find that no agreement had been made with the French and after checking called with the news that "Mr. Churchill knew nothing about the Brittany project". Churchill ''was'' of the view that the new corps forming in France should stay, at least until the final French collapse and then return through the nearest port. Without the support of the 52nd Division on the left flank, the Tenth Army was cut off from Brittany, when two German divisions got into the peninsula first and forced the French line of retreat south to the Loire. French troops already in the area were able to join the main French force, after the Canadians had departed for England.{{sfn|Karslake|1979|pp=265–267}}

The name for the carnival comes from the German dialect word {{Lang|de|roose}} meaning "frolic" and {{Lang|de|Montag}} meaning Monday.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Overview==
The {{Lang|de|Karneval}} season begins at [[11 (number)|11]] minutes past the eleventh hour on 11 November and the "street carnival" starts on the Thursday before {{Lang|de|Rosenmontag|italic=no}}, which is known as {{Lang|de|Weiberfastnacht}} ("women's carnival", [[Fat Thursday]]). {{Lang|de|Karneval}} is prevalent in Roman Catholic areas and is a continuation of the old Roman traditions of slaves and servants being master for a day. {{Lang|de|Karneval}} derives from the Latin {{Lang|la|carnem levare}} ("taking leave of meat") marking the beginning of Lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | doi = 
  | accessdate = 2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnival is not a national holiday in Germany, but schools are closed on {{Lang|de|Rosenmontag|italic=no}} and the following Tuesday in the strongholds and many other areas. Many schools as well as companies tend to give teachers, pupils and employees the Thursday before {{Lang|de|Rosenmontag|italic=no}} off as well and have celebrations in school or in the working place on {{Lang|de|Weiberfastnacht}}, although every now and then there are efforts to cut these free holidays in some companies.

Celebrations usually include dressing up in fancy [[costume]]s, dancing, [[parade]]s, heavy [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]] and general public displays with floats. Every town in the {{Lang|de|Karneval}} areas boasts at least one parade with floats making fun of the themes of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually sweets ({{Lang|de|Kamelle}}) are thrown into the crowds lining the streets among cries of {{Lang|de|Helau}} or {{Lang|de|Alaaf}}, whereby the cry {{Lang|de|Kölle Alaaf}} is only applied in the [[Cologne Carnival]] &amp;ndash; {{Lang|de|Alaaf}} stems from or {{Lang|ksh|Alle af}}, [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] for "all [others] away". [[Sweet]]s and [[tulip]]s are thrown into the crowd.

The celebrations become quieter the next day, known as {{Lang|de|Veilchendienstag}} ("Violet Tuesday", [[Shrove Tuesday]]), and end with [[Ash Wednesday]].

'''''Saṃvatsarī''''' ({{lang-sa|संवत्सरी}}) (lit. Annual Day or fig. Forgiveness Day) is the last day of ''[[Paryushana]]'' festival observed annually by the followers of [[Shwetambar]] sect of [[Jainism]]. It falls on [[Paksha#Shukla Paksha|Shukla]] [[Panchami]] (5th day of waxing fortnight) each year in [[Jain calendar]] month of [[Bhadrapada]], somewhere between the middle of August and September in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. 

On this day, Jains forgive and seek [[forgiveness]] for their mistakes committed knowingly or unknowingly from all the living beings. A yearly, elaborate penitential retreat called "''samvatsari [[pratikramana]]''" is performed on this day. After the ''pratikramana'', Jains seek forgiveness from all the creatures of the world, including friends and relatives by uttering the phrase — ''[[Micchami Dukkadam]]'' or its variants like "Khamau Sa", "Uttam Kshama" or "Khamat Khamna".

==Etymology==
Samvatsari is derived from the Hindi word "''Samvatsara''" which itself has its origin in the Sanskrit language. ''[[Samvatsara]]'' refers to a "year" in Vedic literature such as the ''[[Rigveda]]'' and other ancient texts.&lt;ref name="Vatsyayan1992p215"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bettina Bäumer|author2=Kapila Vatsyayan|title=Kalātattvakośa: A Lexicon of Fundamental Concepts of the Indian Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8f38pN2lvhIC&amp;pg=PA215|year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1044-0|pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, Samvatsari literally refers to a day that comes annually.

==Customs and Traditions==
As a matter of ritual, they personally greet their friends and relatives [[Micchami Dukkadam]]. No private quarrel or dispute may be carried beyond Saṃvatsarī and messages, telephone calls are made to the outstation friends and relatives asking their forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt; Hastings, James (2003), Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 10, Kessinger Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-7661-3682-3}} p.876&lt;/ref&gt;

Being the holiest day of the [[Jain calendar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Shah | first =Nathubhai | title =Jainism: The World of Conquerors | publisher =Sussex Academy Press | date =1998 | location =Sussex | series =Volume I and II | isbn =1-898723-30-3 }} p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/13/stories/2007091353590500.htm|title=Jains pray for peace, brotherhood |author=|date=2007-09-13|accessdate= 2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; many Jains observe a complete fast on this day.

== ''Samvatsari'' and ''Kshamavaani'' ==
While ''Samvatsari'' and ''[[Kshamavaani]]'' are typically associated with [[Shwetambar]] sect and [[Digambara]] respectively, there is no major difference between the two days and both are observed as Forgiveness Days. Rather, the two are usually used interchangeably.

However, a major difference between the two is that despite both ''Samvatsari'' and ''Kshamavaani'' falling on the last day of [[Paryushan]], they are in fact two different days. This is because the [[Paryushan]] festival for the two sects itself commences on different dates and is of varying duration.

As a result, while Samvatsari is observed on  Shukla Panchami of Bhadrapada month by the [[Shwetambar]]s, the [[Digambara]]s celebrate it on the first day of ''[[Ashvin]] Krishna'' month of the lunar-based [[Vira Nirvana Samvat|Jain calendar]].

In 1991 the '''[[Shakespeare Theatre Company]]''', under Artistic Director [[Michael Kahn (theatre director)|Michael Kahn]], initiated its annual '''Free For All''' performances in Washington, D.C.’s [[Rock Creek Park]]. Each year the Company performs a show free to the public, usually from a previous season. In 2009 the Free For All was moved indoors to [[Sidney Harman Hall]], one of two theatres operated by the Shakespeare Theatre Company in downtown D.C. This more accessible location allows the Shakespeare Theatre Company to perform rain or shine, offer matinees, maintain the artistic excellence of the production and increase the overall number of Free For All performances.

The first Free For All production in 1991 was ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', starring [[Paul Winfield]] as [[Falstaff]]. More recent shows have included ''Much Ado about Nothing'', ''A Midsummer Night’s Dream'' and ''Pericles''. ''A Midsummer Night’s Dream'', the Free For All production for 2005, traveled to the [[Aspen Institute]]’s Ideas Festival in [[Colorado]] that same summer.

The [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] received The [[Washington Post]] Award for Distinguished Community Service in 1992 and the 1997 Public Humanities Award from the Humanities Council of Washington D.C. for the Free For All.

In Australia, there are around 500 travelling show families, Australian travelling show families in the Eastern states have a travelling School that has approximately 90 children.

== Ireland ==
Family names associated with funfairs in Ireland include Cassells, Cullen, McFadden, Bird, Perks and Bell. Turbetts, Hudsons, McCormacks, McGurk, Wilmots and Grahams are associated with coastal amusements, particularly in the west of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Arks and Waltzers  Part 1 - 1990 to Present Day|url=http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/miscellaneous_articles/article1.html|publisher=The University of Sheffield&amp;nbsp;– National Fairground Archive|accessdate=01-06-2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222003251/http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/miscellaneous_articles/article1.html|archivedate=2011-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Edwards - Ring and Blocks.jpg|thumb|Robert Edwards, a seventh generation British showman, running his Ring and Blocks stall]]

== United Kingdom ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], show-people are involved with funfairs. The [[Showmen's Guild of Great Britain]] is the most dominant [[trade association]], with a membership of around 4,700.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.showmensguild.co.uk/ Showmen's Guild of Great Britain Central Office].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Guild co-organizes [[St Giles' Fair]] in [[Oxford]] with [[Oxford City Council]] each September. The Association of Independent Showmen and Society of Independent Roundabout Proprietors are just two more [[trade associations]]

== United States ==
Showmen in the [[United States]] are also male dancers or performers in shows, usually alongside [[showgirl]]s; an example would be [[Gene Kelly]] in the film ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]''.

The term ''showman'' or ''show people'', can also be meant as a superlative or complimentary term, sometimes as an accolade or quasi-title, such as in the documentary name ''[[Harry Saltzman: Showman]]''.

'''TEDxWarsaw''' is an independently organized [[TED (conference)|TED]] event, run annually since March 2010. It was the first and it currently is the largest TEDx event in Poland.

== History ==
TEDxWarsaw was founded in August 2009 by [[Ralph Talmont]] together with Adam Liwiński and Maciej Michalski. Łukasz Alwast, Julian Kozankiewicz and Małgorzata Minta joined the Team soon after. As at March 2017, close to 40 individuals, and numerous partners are involved on a voluntary basis in organization of public TEDx events in Warsaw.

Apart from the annual, invitation only, day-long conference, a number of smaller events are also created by Team members, notably TEDxYouth@Warsaw and TEDxWarsawSalon. All of these are free to attend, while guests are usually required to go through an application process.

As at March 2017 well over 200 speakers and artists have appeared at the various TEDxWarsaw events, including well-known scientists, actors and performers as well as less well-known thought leaders and achievers in fields ranging from business to photography and personal development to microbiology.

The conference has grown continuously and expanded its audience size to meet demand. The fourth edition of TEDxWarsaw was watched via a live stream by a total of 42,000 people worldwide with peak viewership of 14,000 at the opening.

The 2013 event received "live" &lt;ref&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/relacje/1,126862,13599567,TEDxWarsaw_2013__RELACJA_NA_ZYWO_.html coverage]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Gazeta Wyborcza]] one of the main Polish newspapers and was a trending topic on Polish Twitter. As noted in one of the blog posts about the event, TEDxWarsaw's hand-picked audience is very diverse, ranging from high school students to the elderly, and includes many different professions, from public servants to entrepreneurs and artists to scientists.

The '''Teatro Comunale di Modena''' (Community Theatre of Modena, but renamed in October 2007 as '''Teatro Comunale Luciano Pavarotti''') is an [[opera house]] in the town of [[Modena]], ([[Emilia-Romagna]] province), [[Italy]]. The idea for the creation of the present theatre dates from 1838, when it became apparent that the then-existing ''Teatro Comunale di via Emilia'' (in dual private and public ownership) was no longer suitable for staging opera.  However, this house had been the venue for presentations of all of the works of [[Donizetti]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and [[Rossini]] up to this time, and a flourishing operatic culture existed in Modena.

Under the Mayor of Modena in collaboration with the Conservatorio dell'Illustrissima Comunita (Conservatory of the Most Illustrious Community), architect Francesco Vandelli was engaged to design the ''Teatro dell'Illustrissima Comunita'', as the theatre was first called, "for the dignity of the city and for the transmission of the scenic arts".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Lynn, p.191&lt;/ref&gt; Paid for in the manner typical of the time - from the sale of boxes - in addition to a significant gift from Duke Friedrich IV, Vandelli created a design for the new theatre combining ideas from those in [[Piacenza]], [[Mantua]], and [[Milan]], and it opened on 2 October 1841 with a performance of Gandini's ''Adelaide di Borgogna al Castello di Canossa'', an opera specially commissioned for the occasion.  

Meanwhile, in 1841, the ''Teatro Comunale di via Emilia'' was renamed as the ''Teatro Vecchio'' when the present theatre opened, although the ''Vecchio'' finally closed in 1859, the same year as Duke Friedrich V left Modena.  In turn, this caused another renaming and the ''Illustrissima'' became the ''Teatro Municipale''.
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Modena, 1973) - BEIC 6348647.jpg|thumb|Exterior. Photo by [[Paolo Monti]], 1973.]]

During the [[First World War]] the theatre was under the control of the army and between 1915 and 1923 it was closed and declared to be unsafe. While opera performances continued to be given elsewhere in the city, it was not until 1935 that a pit was created for the ''Municipale'' and, in the last years of the twentieth century, a complete restoration took place.  

The now-renamed ''Teatro Comunale'' (its original name had been restored in 1956) re-opened in December 1998 as a 900-seat auditorium with 112 boxes on four tiers plus a gallery.

Since its opening in 1841 the ''Comunale'' has presented all of the major works of the operatic repertory as well as many new and unfamiliar ones.  Today, its programming typically consists of about seven operas presented during the October to April season for two performances each and the theatre is a member of the Association of the Theatres of Emilia Romagna, thus working cooperatively with opera houses in the region on shared productions.

Following the September 2007 death of world famous opera tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]], a native of the town and a lifelong resident, the Mayor of Modena has announced that the theatre was to be renamed for the singer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=105&amp;sid=1240287  Ariel David, "World Mourns Italian Tenor Pavarotti", WTOPnews.com, 6 September 2007]: "Amid an outpouring of tributes....his northern Italian hometown of Modena, where he died at age 71 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, said it would name the city's theater after its native son".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Anorak''''' is a play by [[Adam Kelly]] about the [[École Polytechnique massacre]] and the life and death of [[Marc Lépine]]. It  is a 90-minute [[dramatic monologue]] told from the killer's point of view. In the performances, audience members are separated between men and women, with the actor speaking to the men exclusively for the first 80 minutes. Only during the detailed description of the massacre are the women in the audience addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/arts-spectacles/PlusArts/2006/12/05/002-anorak_mcgill.asp|title=Théâtre – Polytechnique : La vie de Marc Lépine sur scène – + d'arts et spectacles – Radio-Canada.ca|publisher=|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After each performance, Kelly would hold an optional forum with the audience to discuss issues brought up in the play, including [[gun control]] and [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2006/113006/theatre.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904224527/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2006/113006/theatre.html|title=Montreal Mirror : Theatre : The Anorak|archivedate=4 September 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 December 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the play caused controversy, particularly in French-language media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvanouvelles.ca/video/609655160001|title=Vidéos|work=TVA Nouvelles|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been critically acclaimed, and was awarded a Montreal English Critics Circle Award (MECCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hour.ca/2006/12/07/history-dramatized-history-made/|title=The Anorak, Daniel MacIvor moves on –   History dramatized, history made – Hour Community|publisher=|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=eaa4ba88-5d3e-435b-bbad-d3be83949465&amp;sponsor=|title=Seven plays by seven companies make MECCA's anglo short list|publisher=|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2009/010809/arts8.html|title=Montreal Mirror – NOISEMAKERS 2009 – Arts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=18 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714113710/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2009/010809/arts8.html|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A French translation of the play, by Geneviève Charbonneau, premiered at [[Laval University]] in [[Québec City]] in 2008, with Gaétan Rancourt in the lead role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/societe/2009/12/03/001-polytechnique-theatre2.shtml|title=Le théâtre de la douleur – ICI.Radio-Canada.ca|work=Radio-Canada.ca|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kelly acted in the French version for the 20th anniversary of the massacre at [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sac.umontreal.ca/servlet/ca.umontreal.sac.site.servlet.CalendrierInfo?eventId=199|title=Service des activités culturelles|publisher=|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his work on ''The Anorak'', Kelly was recruited to collaborate with [[Denis Villeneuve]] on his film ''[[Polytechnique (film)|Polytechnique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194238/fullcredits/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Welz''' (born 1957 as Thomas Berndt in [[Bad Berka]]) grew up in the suburbs of [[Berlin]]. 
As head of the information department, he was editor and author of several illegal [[samizdat|samizdat publications]] with [[Rainer Eppelmann]] of the peace circle of the [[East Berlin]] Samariterkirche (Church of the Good Samaritan) in [[Berlin-Friedrichshain]]. Many of them became the mouthpiece of the [[Peaceful Revolution|East German civil rights movement]], including publications like "Shalom", "Wegzehrung" and "Wendezeit", one of the first publications, in where term [[Die Wende|"Wende"]] was used.
During his military service in the [[National People's Army|NVA]], Thomas Welz was detained for five months from October 1978 in the infamous military prison in [[Schwedt]].

Welz, active in various initiatives and ''ad hoc'' groups of the [[Peaceful Revolution|East German opposition]] and the peace movement was  co-founder of the oppositional political group [[Democratic Awakening]] in 1989. After [[German reunification]] in 1990, he was active in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. He is married and has two sons. He lives in [[Berlin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17795">'''''Tribunus plebis''''', rendered in English as '''''tribune of the plebs''''', '''''tribune of the people''''' or '''''plebeian tribune''''', was the first office of the [[Roman Republic|Roman state]] that was open to the [[plebs|plebeians]], and throughout the history of the Republic, the most important check on the power of the [[Roman Senate]] and [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]].  These [[tribune]]s had the power to convene and preside over the ''[[Plebeian Council|Concilium Plebis]]'' (people's assembly); to summon the senate; to propose legislation; and to intervene on behalf of plebeians in legal matters; but the most significant power was to [[veto]] the actions of the [[Roman consul|consuls]] and other magistrates, thus protecting the interests of the plebeians as a class.  The tribunes of the plebs were [[sacrosanct]], meaning that any assault on their person was prohibited by law. In [[Roman Empire|imperial times]], the powers of the tribunate were granted to the [[Roman emperor|emperor]] as a matter of course, and the office itself lost its independence and most of its functions.&lt;ref name="OCD"&gt;''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 2nd Ed. (1970), "Tribuni Plebis."&lt;/ref&gt; During the day the tribunes used to sit on the [[Tribune bench|tribune benches]] on the [[Forum Romanum]].

==Establishment of the tribunate==
[[File:Secessio plebis.JPG|thumb|300px|The Secession of the People to the Mons Sacer, engraving by B. Barloccini, 1849.]]
Fifteen years after the expulsion of the [[King of Rome|kings]] and establishment of the Roman Republic, the plebeians were burdened by the weight of crushing debt.  A series of clashes between the people and the ruling [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] in 495 and 494 BC brought the plebeians to the brink of revolt, and there was talk of assassinating the consuls.  Instead, on the advice of [[Lucius Sicinius Vellutus]], the plebeians [[First secessio plebis|seceded]] ''en masse'' to the ''[[Monte Sacro|Mons Sacer]]'' (the Sacred Mount), a hill outside of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' ii. 23–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The senate dispatched [[Agrippa Menenius Lanatus (consul 503 BC)|Agrippa Menenius Lanatus]], a former consul who was well-liked by the plebeians, as an envoy to the plebeians. Menenius was well-received, and told the fable of the belly and the limbs, likening the people to the limbs who chose not to support the belly, and thus starved themselves; just as the belly and the limbs, the city, he explained, could not survive without both the patricians and plebeians working in concert.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' ii. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plebeians agreed to negotiate for their return to the city; and their condition was that special tribunes should be appointed to represent the plebeians, and to protect them from the power of the consuls.  No member of the senatorial class would be eligible for this office (in practice, this meant that only plebeians were eligible for the tribunate), and the tribunes should be sacrosanct; any person who laid hands on one of the tribunes would be outlawed, and the whole body of the plebeians entitled to kill such person without fear of penalty. The senate agreeing to these terms, the people returned to the city.&lt;ref name="Livy ii. 33"&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' ii. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''tribuni plebis'' were [[Lucius Albinius|Lucius Albinius Paterculus]] and [[Licinia (gens)#Early Licinii|Gaius Licinius]], appointed for the year 493 BC.  Soon afterward, the tribunes themselves appointed Sicinius and two others as their colleagues.&lt;ref name="Livy ii. 33"/&gt;

The ancient sources indicate the tribunes may have originally been two or five in number.  If the former, the college of tribunes was expanded to five in 470 BC.  Either way, the college was increased to ten in 457 BC, and remained at this number throughout Roman history.  They were assisted by two ''[[aedile|aediles plebis]]'', or plebeian aediles.  Only plebeians were eligible for these offices, although there were at least two exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', ii. 33, 58 (citing [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133 BC)|Piso]], iii. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers of the tribunes&lt;!--'Tribunician power' redirects here--&gt;==
Although sometimes referred to as plebeian magistrates, the tribunes of the people, like the [[Aedile|plebeian aediles]], who were created at the same time, were technically not magistrates, as they were elected by the plebeian assembly alone.  However, they functioned very much like magistrates of the Roman state.  They could convene the ''concilium plebis'', which was entitled to pass legislation affecting the plebeians alone (''plebiscita''), and beginning in 493 BC to elect the plebeian tribunes and aediles.  From the institution of the tribunate, any one of the tribunes of the plebs was entitled to preside over this assembly.  The tribunes were entitled to propose legislation before the assembly.  By the third century BC, the tribunes also had the right to call the senate to order, and lay proposals before it.&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Frost Abbott, ''A History and Description of Roman Political Institutions'', Ginn &amp; Co., 1901, pp. 196, 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ius intercessionis'', also called ''intercessio,'' the power of the tribunes to intercede on behalf of the plebeians and veto the actions of the magistrates, was unique in Roman history.  Because they were not technically magistrates, and thus possessed no ''maior potestas'', they relied on their sacrosanctity to obstruct actions unfavourable to the plebeians.  Being sacrosanct, no person could harm the tribunes or interfere with their activities.  To do so, or to disregard the veto of a tribune, was punishable by death, and the tribunes could order the death of persons who violated their sacrosanctity.  This could be used as a protection when a tribune needed to arrest someone.  This sacrosanctity also made the tribunes independent of all magistrates; no magistrate could veto the action of a tribune.  If a magistrate, the senate, or any other assembly disregarded the orders of a tribune, he could "interpose the sacrosanctity of his person" to prevent such action.  Only a [[Roman dictator|dictator]] (or perhaps an [[interrex]]) was exempted from the veto power.&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt;

The tribunes could veto acts of the Roman senate. The tribune [[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus]] imposed his veto on all government functions in 133 BC, when the senate attempted to block his agrarian reforms by imposing the veto of another tribune.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]]us, ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'' Tiberius Gracchus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tribunes also possessed the authority to enforce the right of ''provocatio ad populum'', a precursor of the modern right of ''[[habeas corpus]]''.  This entitled a [[Roman citizenship|citizen]] to appeal the actions of a magistrate by shouting ''appello tribunos!'' ("I call upon the tribunes") or ''provoco ad populum!'' ("I appeal to the people").&lt;ref&gt;See the use of both forms by Volero in Livy's account.{{cite book|last1=Livy|title=Ab urbe condita|location=2.55.5|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once invoked, this right required one of the tribunes to assess the situation, and determine the lawfulness of the magistrate's action.  Any action taken in defiance of this right was illegal on its face.  In effect, this gave the tribunes of the people unprecedented power to protect individuals from the arbitrary exercise of state power, and afforded Roman citizens a degree of liberty unequalled in the ancient world. If the tribune decided to act, he would impose his ''ius intercessionis'' ("right of intercession").

==Limitations==
Although a tribune could veto any action of the magistrates, senate, or other assemblies, he had to be physically present in order to do so.

Because the sacrosanctity of the tribunes depended on the oath of the plebeians to defend them, their powers were limited to the boundaries of the city of Rome. A tribune traveling abroad could not rely on his authority to intervene on behalf of the plebeians. For this reason, the activities of the tribunes were normally confined to the city itself, and a one-mile radius beyond.&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt;

==History==

===The tribunes in the conflict of the orders===
In 471 BC the [[Lex Publilia (471 BC)|Lex Publilia]] transferred the election of the tribunes from [[comitia curiata]] to the [[comitia tributa]], thus removing the influence of the patricians on their election.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', ii. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 462, the tribune [[Gaius Terentillius Arsa]] alleged that the consular government had become even more oppressive than the monarchy that it had replaced.  He urged the passage of a law appointing five commissioners to define and limit the powers of the consuls.  By threat of war and plague, the issue was postponed for five contentious years, with the same college of tribunes elected each year.  In 457, hoping to deprive the law's supporters of their impetus, the senate agreed to increase the number of tribunes to ten, provided that none of the tribunes from the preceding years should be re-elected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' iii. 8–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the new tribunes continued to press for the adoption of Terentillus' law, until in 454 the senate agreed to appoint three commissioners to study Greek laws and institutions, and on their return help to resolve the strife between the orders.  On the return of the envoys, the senate and the tribunes agreed to the appointment of a committee of ten men, known as the [[Decemviri#Decemviri Legibus Scribundis Consulari Imperio|decemviri]], or decemvirs, to serve for one year in place of the annual magistrates, and codify Roman law.  The tribunate itself was suspended during this time.  But when a second college of decemvirs appointed for the year 450 illegally continued their office into the following year, and the abuses of their authority became clear to the people, the decemvirate was abolished and the tribunate restored, together with the annual magistrates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' iii. 32–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the laws codified by the decemvirs was one forbidding intermarriage between the patricians and the plebeians; the [[Twelve Tables]] of Roman law also codified that the consulate itself was closed to the plebeians.  Worse still, in 448, two patricians were co-opted to fill vacant positions in the tribunate, although they proved to be of moderate views, and their year of office was peaceful.  To prevent future attempts by the patricians to influence the selection of tribunes, [[Lucius Trebonius Asper]] promulgated [[Lex Trebonia (448 BC)|a law]] forbidding the tribunes to co-opt their colleagues, and requiring their election to continue until all of the seats were filled.   But relations between the orders deteriorated, until in 445, the tribunes, led by [[Gaius Canuleius]], were able to push through [[lex Canuleia|a law]] permitting the intermarriage of patricians and plebeians, and allowing one of the consuls to be a plebeian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' iv. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than permit the election of a plebeian consul, the senate resolved upon the election of [[tribuni militum consulari potestate|military tribunes with consular power]], who might be elected from either order.  Initially this compromise satisfied the plebeians, but in practice only patricians were elected.  The regular election of military tribunes in the place of consuls prevented any plebeians from assuming the highest offices of state until the year 400, when four of the six military tribunes were plebeians.  Plebeian military tribunes served in 399, 396, 383, and 379, but in all other years between 444 and 376 BC, every consul or military tribune with consular powers was a patrician.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' iv. 6. ''ff'', v. 12. ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 376, [[Gaius Licinius Stolo|Gaius Licinius Calvus Stolo]] and [[Lucius Sextius|Lucius Sextius Lateranus]], tribunes of the plebs, used the veto power to prevent the election of any annual magistrates.  Continuing in office each year, they frustrated the patricians, who, despite electing patrician military tribunes from 371 to 367, finally conceded the consulship, agreeing to the [[Lex Licinia Sextia|Licinian Rogations]].  Under this law, military tribunes with consular power were abolished, and one of the consuls elected each year was to be a plebeian.  Although this law was occasionally violated by the election of two patrician consuls, Sextius himself was elected consul for 366, and Licinius in 364.  At last, the plebeian tribunes had broken the patrician monopoly on the highest magistracies of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' vi. 35, 36, 38, 42, vii. 1, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Romaike Archaiologia'' xiv. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]]us, ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'' "Life of Camillus."&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their victory in 367, the tribunes remained an important check on the power of the senate and the annual magistrates.  In 287 BC, the senate formally recognized the ''plebiscita'' as laws with binding force.&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt;  In 149 BC, men elected to the tribunate automatically entered the Senate.

===Erosion of the tribunician power at the end of the Republic===
However, in 81 BC, the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Sulla]], who considered the tribunate a threat to his power, deprived the tribunes of their powers to initiate legislation, and to veto acts of the senate.  He also prohibited former tribunes from holding any other office, effectively preventing the use of the tribunate as a stepping stone to higher office.  Although the tribunes retained the power to intercede on behalf of individual citizens, most of their authority was lost under Sulla's reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Frost Abbott, ''A History and Description of Roman Political Institutions'', Ginn &amp; Co., 1901, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Former tribunes were once again [[Lex Aurelia de tribunicia potestate|admitted to the annual magistracies]] beginning in 75 BC, and the tribunician authority was fully restored by the consuls [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] in 70.&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt; 

The dignity of the office was further impaired when, in 59 BC, the patrician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], who aspired to hold the tribunician power, had himself adopted by a plebeian youth, and renounced his patrician status, in order to be elected tribune for the following year. Although absurd, Clodius' scheme was allowed to proceed, and he embarked on a program of legislation designed to outlaw his political opponents and confiscate their property, while realizing a substantial gain from his actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''Pro Domo Sua'' 13; ''[[De Haruspicum Responsis]]'' 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]]us, ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'' "Life of Cicero."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Haskell, ''This was Cicero'' (1924), pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 48 BC, the senate bestowed the ''tribunicia potestas'' (tribunician power) on the dictator [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], who, as a patrician, was ineligible to be elected one of the tribunes. When two of the elected tribunes attempted to obstruct his actions, Caesar had them impeached, and taken before the senate, where they were deprived of their powers. Never again did Caesar face opposition from the tribunes; he held the tribunician power until his death in 44.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Frost Abbott, ''A History and Description of Roman Political Institutions'', Ginn &amp; Co., 1901, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

In 23 BC, the senate bestowed the tribunician power on Caesar's nephew, [[Augustus|Octavian]], now styled ''Augustus''.  From this point, the ''tribunicia potestas'' became a pre-requisite for the emperors, most of whom received it from the senate upon claiming the throne, though some had already received this power during the reigns of their predecessors; the granting of this authority was a means of designating a favoured member of the imperial court as the emperor's intended successor.  [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]], [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus the Younger]], [[Tiberius]], [[Titus]], [[Trajan]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]] each received the tribunician power in this way.  With the regular assumption of the tribunician power by the emperors and their heirs, the ancient authority of the tribunes dwindled away.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]], ''The Roman Emperors'' (1985), pp. 13, 20, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the office of tribune endured throughout [[Roman empire|imperial times]], its independence and most of its practical functions were lost.  Together with the aedileship, it remained a step in the political career of many plebeians who aspired to sit in the senate, at least until the third century.  There is evidence that the tribunate continued to exist as late as the fifth century AD.&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2231">The '''Trinity International Hip Hop Festival''' is a free music festival that brings together [[Hip Hop]] artists from around the world. It has been held annually at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in [[Hartford, CT]] since 2006. 

"The festival was designed to promote international understanding and community development through hip-hop."&lt;ref&gt;"World Hip-Hop Questions US Rap." ''BBC News''. April 29, 2006. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4950692.stm.&lt;/ref&gt; It is "the first and only free global Hip-Hop festival dedicated to educating and exposing the public to Hip-Hop from around the world."&lt;ref&gt;"About The Festival." ''The 4th Annual Trinity International Hip-Hop Festival''. http://trinityhiphop.org/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The festival was co-founded by Trinity College students Jason Azevedo, Magee McIlvaine, and Ben Herson to "combat the disunity, segregation, and violence of Hartford, CT and Trinity College using the historically education-oriented and politically revolutionary medium — Hip Hop – and focusing on its global potency and proliferation to unify Trinity College, the city of Hartford, and the Globe."&lt;ref&gt;"About." ''The 4th Annual Trinity International Hip-Hop Festival''. http://trinityhiphop.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concert portion of the 2009 festival was headlined by Somalian Hip Hop artist [[K'Naan]] and featured performances by many artists, including BeatBurgerBand from the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poetic Pilgrimage]] from the [[United Kingdom]], Blitz the Ambassador from [[Ghana]], and Game Rebellion from [[Brooklyn, NY]]. 

The festival does not focus solely on the musical aspect of Hip Hop; [[B-boy]] battles, [[graffiti]] art sessions, panel discussions about pressing issues in Hip Hop, and film screenings have been incorporated into the festival each year.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Robert.

'''Turkvision Song Contest 2016''' ({{lang-tr|Türkvizyon Şarkı Yarışması 2016}}) would have been the fourth edition of [[Turkvision Song Contest]], and was scheduled to take place at the Yahya Kemal Beyatli Cultural Centre, in Istanbul, Turkey; and organised by [[TMB TV]] and [[Azad Azerbaijan TV]].

Twenty-six [[List of Turkic dynasties and countries|Turkic regions]], which have either a large Turkic population or a widely spoken Turkic language, had confirmed their participation in the contest. {{Tsccnty|Dagestan}}, {{Tsccnty|Kumyk}}, {{Tsccnty|Latvia}}, {{Tsccnty|Moldova}}, {{Tsccnty|Netherlands}}, {{Tsccnty|Poland}}, {{Tsccnty|Stavropol Krai}} and {{Tsccnty|Sweden}} were expected to be making their debut, whilst {{Tsccnty|Altai Republic}}, {{Tsccnty|Bashkortostan}}, {{Tsccnty|Crimea}}, {{Tsccnty|Kabardino-Balkaria}}, {{Tsccnty|Moscow}}, {{Tsccnty|Tatarstan}}, {{Tsccnty|Tuva}}, and {{Tsccnty|Yakutia}} were going to be returning after a {{Tscyr|2015|one-year absence}}. {{Tsccnty|Karachay-Cherkessia}} had chosen not to return to the contest and would no longer be in joint-participation with {{Tsccnty|Kabardino-Balkaria}}, meaning the latter would have been participating as a single region. {{Tsccnty|Khakassia}} also initially planned to return to the contest and had selected their participant, but later withdrew from competing.

In February 2017, two months after the contest was supposed to air, it was announced as being cancelled, and Kazakhstan were announced as the hosts for the [[Turkvision Song Contest 2017]] in [[Astana]]. Apparently, it was too much to ask, because it too was cancelled, and the contest has not been held since.

==Location==
{{details|topic=the host city|Istanbul}}

}}
In May 2016 it was announced by Subhane Isgenderova the Azerbaijan Head of Delegation that [[Antalya]] was going to be the host city for the fourth edition of the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvizton 16 contest to be held in Antalya?|url=http://eurovoix-world.com/turkvizyon16-contest-to-be-held-in-antalya/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=28 August 2016|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 11 July 2016, it was later confirmed that the announcement made Isgenderova was in fact incorrect, and the official host city would be Istanbul.&lt;ref name="IstanbulHost"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvizton 16 host city confirmed as Istanbul|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvizyon16-host-city-confirmed-as-istanbul/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=28 August 2016|date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venue===
[[File:YkbGosteriMerkezi.jpg|thumb|right|Yahya Kemal Beyatli Cultural Centre, venue for the 2016 edition.|225px]]
Had the 2016 contest gone ahead as scheduled the venue would have been for the second consecutive year, the Yahya Kemal Beyatli Cultural Centre, which has 10,000 covered seats of 30,000 seats at total in [[Küçükçekmece]] district of [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kucukcekmece.bel.tr/icerikler/kultur-merkezleri/ykb-gosteri-merkezi/2021|title=YKB Gosteri merkezi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Just like the 2015 edition, which had no semi-final stage because of the withdrawals from {{Tsccnty|Russia|several Russian states}} from the contest due to the international relations between the Russian Federation and Turkey in 2015, it was announced that the same format would have continued at the 2016 edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvizyon ’15: confirmed no semi final to be held|url=http://eurovoix-world.com/turkvizyon15-confirmed-no-semi-final-to-be-held/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=13 December 2015|date=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvizyon ’15: all Russian regions withdraw from the contest|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvizyon15-all-russian-regions-withdraw-from-the-contest/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=28 August 2016|date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National host broadcaster===
On 15 July 2016 it was confirmed that [[Television in Turkey|Turkish Music Box Television]] (TMB TV) would have been the host broadcaster for the second consecutive year, which would have been responsible for the organisation of the contest.&lt;ref name="TMB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvizton 16 meeting held in Istanbul|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvizyon16-meeting-held-in-istanbul/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=28 August 2016|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancellation===
On 8 December 2016, it was announced that the contest had been delayed until March 2017, marking the first time since the inaugural contest in 2013 that a postponement of the contest had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvision Song Contest delayed until March|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvision-song-contest-delayed-march/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=8 December 2016|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later confirmed that the 2016 contest had been cancelled for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="TSC2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvision Song Contest 2017 to be held in Kazakhstan|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvision-song-contest-2017-to-be-held-in-kazakhstan/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=15 February 2017|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contest was rescheduled to take place between 8–10 September 2017 at the [[Barys Arena]], in [[Astana]], [[Kazakhstan]], but even that was too much to ask, as it was cancelled again on October 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Final of Turkvision 2017 to be held September 10|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvision17-final-turkvision-2017-held-september-10/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|date=18 February 2017|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisional list of participants==
Twenty-six Turkic regions, which have either a large Turkic population or a widely spoken Turkic language, had confirmed their participation in the contest, fifteen of which had selected their artist (nine of those having also chosen their song). [[Shir Charyev]] was announced as participating, although details as to which country he would have represented had not been disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Anthony|title=Turkvizyon’16: Shir Charyev to participate in Turkvision|url=https://eurovoix-world.com/turkvision16-shir-charyev-participate-turkvision/|website=eurovoix-world.com|publisher=Eurovoix|accessdate=29 November 2016|date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- When writing artist names and song titles, please make sure they are Romanized per [[WP:Romanization]]. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Only Wikilink to the first reference of a language, per [[WP:OVERLINK]], overlinking is to be avoided as best as possible. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Please avoid using Twitter as a source per [[WP:TWITTER]]. Sources need to be reliable. Twitter is not always reliable. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Only adding data to the language column once the song has been selected or if there is a source to verify a song will be performed in that given language. For example, Cyprus has 3 languages, so we shouldn't speculate on just one of them without any sources. --&gt;

{{Ukrainian crisis}}
A prolonged '''crisis in [[Ukraine]]''' began on 21 November 2013 when then-president [[Viktor Yanukovych]] suspended preparations for the implementation of [[Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement|an association agreement]] with the [[European Union]]. The decision sparked [[Euromaidan|mass protests from the proponents of the agreement]]. The protests, in turn, precipitated [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|a revolution that led to Yanukovych's ousting]]. After the ousting, [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|unrest enveloped]] in the largely [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russophone]] [[Eastern Ukraine|eastern]] and [[Southern Ukraine|southern]] regions of Ukraine, from where Yanukovych had drawn most of his support. Subsequently, an ensuing political crisis developed after [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russia invaded said regions]] and [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed the then-autonomous Ukrainian region of Crimea]]. As Russia's invasion emboldened the Russophone Ukrainians already in upheaval, the unrest in the [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] oblasts devolved into [[war in Donbass|a subnational war]] against the post-revolutionary Ukrainian government. Then, as that conflict progressed, the Russophone Ukrainian opposition turned into a pro-Russian insurgency often supported and assisted by the [[Russian military]] and [[Russian special forces|its special forces]].&lt;ref name="NYTbalk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Andrew|last2=Kramer|first2=Andrew E.|title=Pro-Russian Insurgents Balk at Terms of Pact in Ukraine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/world/europe/ukraine-russia.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=7 April 2018|date=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reutersquit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tsvetkova|first1=Maria|title=Special Report: Russian soldiers quit over Ukraine|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-soldiers-specialreport/special-report-russian-soldiers-quit-over-ukraine-idUSKBN0NV06Q20150510|website=reuters.com|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=7 April 2018|date=2015-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|2014 Euromaidan regional state administration occupations}}
During 24 January 2014, various western Ukrainian cities such as [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], and [[Chernivtsi]] had protesters seize regional government buildings in protest of president [[Viktor Yanukovych]].
In [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], nearly 1,500 protesters occupied the regional government building and barricaded themselves inside the building. The city of [[Chernivtsi]] saw crowds of protesters storm the governors office while police officers protected the building. [[Uzhgorod]] also had regional offices blockaded, and in the western city of [[Lviv]]
barricades were being erected just after previously seizing the governor's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124181216/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25876807 | title=BBC News - Ukraine unrest: Protesters storm regional offices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 2014, the entrance to the local administration building in the western city of [[Lviv]] was said to be guarded by "young masked men", who wielded wooden clubs. The local governor at the time [[Oleh Salo]], was ousted three weeks prior to the blockade of the administration building, he stated that he still couldn't gain access to the entrance as the building was sealed off by a "high barricade of rubber tires", and inside the lobby of the building was a statue draped with the flag of the [[European Union]]. During an interview with governor [[Oleh Salo]] in a borrowed room at the local cultural department, he addressed during the interview that he was not in his office when protesters stormed the building. He also received a panicked phone call on his personal phone from a local staff member in the administration building at the time, who screamed "Please save us. You have to do something to save us." the governor recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225040344/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/world/europe/a-ukraine-city-spins-beyond-the-governments-reach.html?mtrref=www.google.com | title=A Ukraine City Spins Beyond the Government's Reach - the New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lysychansk 16.jpg|thumb|Damaged building in [[Lysychansk]], 4 August 2014]]
From the beginning of March 2014, demonstrations by [[Russophilia|pro-Russian]] and anti-government groups took place in the [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] oblasts of Ukraine, together commonly called the "Donbass", in the aftermath of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] and the [[Euromaidan]] movement. These demonstrations, which followed the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]], and which were part of a wider group of [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|concurrent pro-Russian protests across southern and eastern Ukraine]], escalated into an [[War|armed conflict]] between the [[Separatism|separatist forces]] of the self-declared [[Donetsk People's Republic|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic|Luhansk]] People's Republics (DPR and LPR respectively), and the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/armed-pro-russian-insurgents-in-luhansk-say-they-are-ready-for-police-raid-343167.html|title=Armed pro-Russian insurgents in Luhansk say they are ready for police raid|publisher=Kyiv Post|date=12 April 2014|last=Grytsenko|first=Oksana|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412131249/http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/armed-pro-russian-insurgents-in-luhansk-say-they-are-ready-for-police-raid-343167.html|archivedate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukraine-special-forces-sent-eastern-city-retake-buildings-082049113.html|title=Ukraine to deploy troops to quash pro-Russian insurgency in the east|work=Yahoo News Canada|date=14 April 2014|agency=Associated Press|last=Leonard|first=Peter|accessdate=26 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414125950/https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ukraine-special-forces-sent-eastern-city-retake-buildings-082049113.html|archivedate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to a change of the top leadership in August 2014,&lt;ref name="jamestown-20140815"&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=42756&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=27&amp;cHash=d9a2b36398fb823841ea5b668577feca#.U-8Yxdr3-yw Strelkov/Girkin Demoted, Transnistrian Siloviki Strengthened in 'Donetsk People's Republic'], [[Vladimir Socor]], [[Jamestown Foundation]], 15 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the separatists were largely led by Russian citizens.&lt;ref name="REUeuada"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/27/us-ukraine-crisis-rebels-insight-idUSKBN0FW07020140727 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728013327/https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/27/us-ukraine-crisis-rebels-insight-idUSKBN0FW07020140727 |archivedate=2014-07-28 |title=Pushing locals aside, Russians take top rebel posts in east Ukraine |agency=Reuters |date=27 July 2014 |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian paramilitaries are reported to make up from 5% to 20% of the combatants.&lt;ref name="REUeuada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rumedia.biz/item/3037|script-title=ru:Представитель ДНР назвал процент российских добровольцев в местной армии|trans-title=DPR representative revealed the percentage of Russian volunteers in the local army|language=ru|publisher=rumedia.biz|date=27 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015164343/http://rumedia.biz/item/3037|archivedate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.censor.net.ua/resonance/295448/rossiyiskiyi_naemnik_polovina_opolchentsev_iz_rossii_mne_pomogayut_sponsory_my_vozmem_lvov |title=Российский Наемник: "Половина Ополченцев - Из России.

Between 22 and 25 August 2014, Russian artillery, personnel, and what Russia called a "humanitarian convoy" were reported to have crossed the border into Ukrainian territory without the permission of the Ukrainian government. Reportedly, crossings occurred both in areas under the control of pro-Russian forces and areas that were not under their control, such as the south-eastern part of [[Donetsk Oblast]], near [[Novoazovsk]].

Amidst the prolonged crisis, multiple elections were held across Ukraine. The first election held since the ousting of President Yanukovych was the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2014|25 May presidential election]], which resulted in the election of [[Petro Poroshenko]] as president of Ukraine.

The war in Donbass caused [[Coal in Ukraine#Coal production|a coal shortage in Ukraine]], as the Donbass region had been the chief source of coal for power stations across the country. Furthermore, [[Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Station]] was forced to close down one of its reactors after an accident. The combination of these two problems led to [[rolling blackouts]] across Ukraine during December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-turns-off-reactor-at-nuclear-plant-after-accident-9947540.html Ukraine turns off reactor at its most powerful nuclear plant after 'accident'], [[The Independent]] (28 December 2014)&lt;br /&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/world/europe/ukraine-briefly-cuts-power-to-crimea-amid-dispute-with-russia-over-nato.html?_r=0 Ukraine Briefly Cuts Power to Crimea Amid Feud With Russia Over NATO], [[New York Times]] (24 December 2014)&lt;br /&gt;[http://itar-tass.com/en/economy/770172 Coal import to help avoid rolling blackouts in Ukraine — energy minister] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108051631/http://itar-tass.com/en/economy/770172 |date=8 January 2015 }}, [[ITAR-TASS]] (31 December 2014)&lt;br /&gt;[http://mashable.com/2014/12/03/ukraine-nuclear-plant-accident/ Rolling blackouts in Ukraine after nuclear plant accident], br&gt;[[Mashable]] (3 December 2014)&lt;br /&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150104004745/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-31/ukraine-to-import-coal-from-far-away-as-war-curtails-mines.html Ukraine to Import Coal From ‘Far Away’ as War Curtails Mines], [[Bloomberg News]] (31 December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, due to the Ukrainian crisis, a construction of a new pipeline in [[Turkey]] with an annual capacity around 63 billion cubic metres ([[Billion cubic metres of natural gas|bcm]]) was proposed, so as to carry [[Russia in the European energy sector|natural gas to Europe]] while completely bypassing Ukraine as a traditional transit hub for Russian gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia to Shift Ukraine Gas Transit to Turkey as EU Cries Foul |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-14/russia-to-shift-ukraine-gas-transit-to-turkey-as-eu-cries-foul.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115014453/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-14/russia-to-shift-ukraine-gas-transit-to-turkey-as-eu-cries-foul.html |archivedate=2015-01-15 |website=Bloomberg |date=14 January 2015 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress on implementing reforms in post-revolutionary Ukraine has been said to be slow. According to a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] report in February 2016, Ukraine remained gripped by corruption, and little progress had been made in improving the economy. Low-level fighting continued in the Donbass. The report also said that there was talk of a "Third Maidan" to force the government to take action to remedy the crisis.&lt;ref name="BBC5FEBY2016"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35483171 | title=Ukraine teeters a few steps from chaos | work=BBC News | date=5 February 2016 | accessdate=6 February 2016 | author=David Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] four-year loan program worth about $17.5 billion was agreed in eight tranches over 2015 and 2016, subject to conditions regarding economic reforms.&lt;ref name=ut-20160513&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uatoday.tv/politics/ukraine-may-get-1-7-bln-from-imf-by-mid-year-moody-s-647646.html |title=Ukraine may get USD 1.7 bln from IMF by mid-year - Moody's |publisher=Ukraine Today |date=13 May 2016 |accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts disputed that the $17.5 billion represented a 'new' bailout, noting that the IMF's announcement amounted to making good on "old promises, rather than offering any new cash."&lt;ref name="Mamlyuk2015"/&gt; However, due to lack of progress on reforms, only two tranches worth $6.7 billion were paid in 2015.

[[File:Upper Penninsula Michigan State Fairgrounds Buildings.jpg|thumb|right|Buildings and sign]]
The '''Upper Peninsula State Fair''' is a fair held annually in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] of the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. It is held in [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]] in mid-August of each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Michigan Yesterday &amp; Today |last = Domm |first =  Robert W. |date = 2009 |publisher = MBI Pub.

In April 1927, Michigan Governor [[Fred W. Green]] signed Act 89, which stated that "an annual state fair at the City of Escanaba, which shall have for its main purpose the exploiting, and encouragement of improved methods in agriculture and industrial pursuits I hereby authorize." The opening day of the first Upper Peninsula State Fair was September 17, 1928. The original price for a ticket to the fair was 50 cents for adults, decreasing to 25 cents after 6pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.dailypress.net/life/features/2017/08/the-start-of-the-upper-peninsula-state-fair/ |title = The Start of the Upper Peninsula State Fair |work = Daily Press |location = Escanaba, MI |language = en-US |access-date = January 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The present site encompasses {{convert|120|acre|km2}} of land and 24 buildings. It also includes nearly 700 campsites.

In 2010, the state ceased funding for the fair and the downstate [[Michigan State Fair]] due to budget problems. Control of fair operations has been passed onto the U.P. State Fair Authority which includes representatives from each county in the U.P. and the Hannahville Indian Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jenny |last= Lancour |date= August 22, 2009 |url= http://www.dailypress.net/page/content.detail/id/514425.html/U.P.-State-Fair-changes-hands |title= U.P. State Fair Changes Hands |work= Daily Press |location= Escanaba, MI }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the discontinuation of the downstate Michigan State Fair, which has failed to attract outside funding and struggled with sharply dropping attendance through the years, the U.P. State Fair will continue on into the foreseeable future.

The fair highlights the lumberjack history of the region through the Great Lakes Timber Show featuring logrolling, speedclimbing, sawing, and axe-throwing demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Domm|2009|p=}}.{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 Fair set a record of attendance of 87,750 according to Executive Director of the Delta Chamber of Commerce, Vickie Micheau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.miningjournal.net/news/local/2017/09/u-p-state-fair-numbers-up-over-2016-best-year-ever/ |title = U.P.

'''''Waiting for the Moon: An American Love Story''''', formerly ''Zelda'' or ''Scott &amp; Zelda: The Other Side Of Paradise'', is a  [[Musical theatre|musical]] with music by [[Frank Wildhorn]] and lyrics by Jack Murphy. It is the second finished production the two have presented, having previously collaborated on ''[[The Civil War (musical)|The Civil War]]''. The show had its world premiere at the Lenape Regional Performing Arts Center in [[Marlton, New Jersey]] in July 2005. The musical is based on the lives of famed American author [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and his wife, [[Zelda Fitzgerald]].

==Production history==
The Lenape Regional Performing Arts Center hosted the world premiere of the musical, in a production that ran from July 20, 2005 through July 31, 2005. Directed by Vincent Marini with choreography by [[Andy Blankenbuehler]] the cast starred [[Jarrod Emick]] and [[Lauren Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, Bob.[http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/nj/nj105.html Review] talkinbroadway.com, July 31, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildhorn had connections with the theatre through [[Linda Eder]]'s concerts, amongst other engagements including the early renditions of the ''[[Jekyll &amp; Hyde (musical)|Jekyll &amp; Hyde]]: Resurrection'' tour. Wildhorn had said he had hoped that Lenape would become "a real successful regional theatre, that he could use as a laboratory for his new productions."&lt;ref name=interview&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/article/Waiting_for_the_Moon_An_Interview_with_Frank_Wildhorn_and_Jack_Murphy_20050728 "Interview with Wildhorn and Murphy,"] broadwayworld.com, July 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy titled the show ''Waiting For The Moon'', as director Vincent Marini didn't believe that ''Scott &amp; Zelda'' sounded right for it. After a dinner outing, Murphy's wife suggested the title and both Murphy and Marini liked it enough that it was adopted.

The rest of the creative team for this production included Ron Melrose as music director, Kim Scharnberg as orchestrator, Rob Odorisio as scenic designer, [[Howell Binkley]] as lighting designer, Janine McCabe as costume designer, Nick Kourtides as sound designer, and Michael Clark credited with the projections design.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, J. Cooper.[http://web2.theatermania.com/new-york/reviews/07-2005/waiting-for-the-moon_6385.html "Review"] theatermania.com, July 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The show was produced by Roy Miller and Vincent Marini, with Angelo del Rossi as consulting producer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankwildhorn.com/projects/waiting/] Official Wildhorn site listing&lt;/ref&gt;

A planned production at North Carolina Theatre ([[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], North Carolina) in July 2007 was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/106348-Wildhorn's_Moon_Won't_Rise_Over_NC_Creators_in_Talks_for_Future "Wildhorn's Moon Won't Rise Over NC; Creators in Talks for Future"] Playbill, March 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was to star once again Lauren Kennedy, with the potential of husband Alan Campbell in the role of Scott.

In October 2012, the musical received its second treatment, again with Kennedy and Emmick in their respective roles. The musical was renamed 
''Zelda: An American Love Story'' and played at the [[Flat Rock Playhouse]] (North Carolina) where Marini had become artistic director.
&lt;ref&gt;Blank, Matthew. [http://www.playbill.com/article/photo-exclusive-enter-the-roaring-twenties-world-of-frank-wildhorns-zelda-with-lauren-kennedy-com-198767# "PHOTO EXCLUSIVE: Enter the "Roaring Twenties" World of Frank Wildhorn's Zelda With Lauren Kennedy"] Playbill, October 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, a new production opened in Tokyo, Japan.

==Plot summary==
The show opens with Zelda getting ready for a ball ("Everything &amp; More"). Scott meanwhile is preparing a manuscript ("I've Got Things to Say"). The musical attempted to show the almost tragic lifestyle of the famed couple&amp;nbsp;— often trying to live up to higher standards ("Always," "Paris," "Back on Top," "Something Enchanted," etc.). Their lifestyle was considered reckless ("Money to Burn"), with Zelda thought to be particularly bizarre for the time period in which she lived (1925), often doing things most women would not think of ("What about Me?"). Act I ends with Zelda in an institution, although many of her conditions unknown, yearning for the upcoming out there ("Something of My Life").

Act II opens with more trips for Scott &amp; Zelda, including Scott's attempt at the Hollywood screenwriting industry ("The Rivera," "Hollywood," etc.). However, Zelda is back to the institution declaring that life isn't fair ("Easy"). Scott's career is fading fast ("Losing the Light") while working in Hollywood. Scott realizes he's lost -- both his career (although it would flourish after his death) and Zelda, who has not visited ("Waiting for the Moon"). Zelda, delusional, believes that Scott is coming to take her to a ball. It is now 1948, years after Scott has died. A reporter comes to ensure she is okay, after he has since stopped years before covering the two. She laments over who Scott really was ("Remember"). In a fairytale vision, she sees Scott taking her to the dance, and they kiss, beneath the moon as the curtain closes.

Wildhorn further explains that "Much of story is told in dance numbers. There's a lot of dancing in this show, about 6 big dance numbers.... The choreography is a major part of this production."&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Nearly all of the twenty songs in the production were sung by either the Zelda character, Scott character, or those two together. Ensemble was used as small characters with short verses, backing up the other two.

*Something Enchanted – Scott and Zelda

[[Lauren Kennedy]], the original Zelda, has, however, released the song "Easy" on her latest solo album, entitled ''Now and Here''.  Other sound clips (including a video preview) can be found at Jack Murphy's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankwildhorn.com/projects/waiting/] frankwildhorn.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8727">The '''Westminster Conference of 1559''' was a religious [[disputation]] held early in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Although the proceedings themselves were perfunctory, the outcome shaped the [[Elizabethan religious settlement]].

==Participants==
The participants were nine leading Catholic churchmen, including five bishops, and nine prominent Protestant reformers of the [[Church of England]].

From the Protestant side, Cox and Jewel gave official accounts, and [[John Foxe]] and [[Raphael Holinshed]] published on the conference based on those.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/holinshed/texts.php?text1=1587_8809 ''Holinshed Project'', The peaceable and prosperous regiment of blessed Queene Elisabeth (1587, Volume 6, p. 1182).]&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts, from Catholics, are by Aloisio Schivenoglia, the [[Gómez Suárez de Figueroa y Córdoba, 1st Duke of Feria|Count de Feria]], and [[Nicholas Sanders]];&lt;ref&gt;G.

==Proceedings==
The conference started on 31 March 1558/9; the disputation began, and was stopped because of disagreement on rules, and was adjourned (as it turned out, permanently), on April 3 (a Monday).&lt;ref name="Morrissey2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Morrissey|title=Politics and the Paul's Cross Sermons, 1558-1642|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7smutvuRcYC&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=16 June 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957176-5|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William P.

There were three articles at issue in the disputation (on the liturgical language, church authority over forms of worship, and scriptural warrant for propitiatory masses).&lt;ref name="RWD"&gt;[[Richard Watson Dixon]], ''History of the Church of England: from the abolition of the Roman jurisdiction'' vol. 5 (1902) pp. 75–7 note; [https://archive.org/stream/historyofthechur05dixouoft#page/n109/mode/2up archive.org.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Bacon (courtier)|Nicholas Bacon]] was in the chair, with [[Nicholas Heath]] sitting by him.&lt;ref name="Bacon"&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=1002|title=Bacon, Nicholas|first=Robert|last=Tittler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birt, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Feckenham]] and [[James Turberville]] sat with the bishops' side.&lt;ref name="RWD"/&gt;

For the Catholic side, Henry Cole began, defending the use of Latin in the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=5851|title=Cole, Henry|first=T. F.|last=Mayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then Robert Horne replied, with a prepared statement. He put the case for English.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=13792|title=Horne, Richard|first=Ralph|last=Houlbrooke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disputation then foundered: there was a lack of agreement whether it should be oral or written, and whether Latin or English should be employed.&lt;ref name="Solt1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo Frank Solt|title=Church and State in Early Modern England: 1509-1640|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a57Ypa5dZBQC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=13 November 2012|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-505979-3|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heath, who had collaborated in Bacon in setting up the disputation, did not intervene to support the Catholic side's view on the pre-agreed conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=12840|title=Heath, Nicholas|first=David|last=Loades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon in the chair was not neutral: he pushed some of the Catholic participants into offensive behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bacon"/&gt; Of the bishops, Watson and White were sent to the [[Tower of London]]. [[Sir Ambrose Cave]] and [[Richard Sackville (escheator)|Sir Richard Sackville]] were ordered to search their houses and papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Cave, Ambrose}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Sackville, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six more of the participants were fined by the privy council.&lt;ref name="Solt1990"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[William Bill]] preached on the reasons for the imprisonment of the two bishops on 9 April. On the following day a new bill for royal supremacy was moved.&lt;ref name="Morrissey2011"/&gt; The [[Uniformity Act of 1559]] passed successfully through Parliament, but the margin in the [[House of Lords]] was a slender three votes. [[Edward Rishton]] attributed absences of Catholic bishops and laymen from the Lords to underhand tactics.&lt;ref name="Solt1990"/&gt;

When in the following year Jewel restated the position of the Church of England after the settlement, and invited refutations, Cole replied to him, starting an extended controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas M McCoog, S.J.|author2=Campion Hall (University of Oxford)|title=The Reckoned Expense: Edmund Campion and Early English Jesuits : Essays in Celebration of the First Centenary of Campion Hall, Oxford (1896-1996)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f01RY4H7MfoC&amp;pg=PA121|accessdate=14 November 2012|year=1996|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-0-85115-590-6|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;
