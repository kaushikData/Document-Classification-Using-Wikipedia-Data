Ohio High School Athletic Association|vol=779|reporter=F.2d|opinion=315|court=6th Cir.|date=December 17, 1985|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F2/779/779.F2d.315.84-3787.html|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a court case heard before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] which held that the right to participate in [[Student athlete|interscholastic sports]] is not a fundamental privilege protected by the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. In particular, the court held that the [[Ohio High School Athletic Association]] could prohibit private high school athletic programs from recruiting students who live in neighboring states.

==Background==
Virtually every [[List of high schools in Ohio|secondary school]] in [[Ohio]], whether public or private, is a member of the [[Ohio High School Athletic Association]] (OHSAA), which regulates interscholastic sports within the state.&lt;ref name="Alerding" /&gt; By the 1970s, private member schools often dominated state championships, even though they made up only about a quarter of OHSAA's 800 members. Public member schools complained that private schools in border cities were recruiting out-of-state students for varsity sports, giving them a competitive edge over public schools.&lt;ref name="Alerding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Enquirer Kaufman"&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Requests More Information On Athletes' Ban|first=Ben L.|last=Kaufman|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=June 5, 1984|page=C2|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/100737403/|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association's rule against recruiting or "school hopping" was difficult to enforce against private schools that could enroll students regardless of residence. There was a rule requiring transfer students to wait one year before joining a team, but that usually left three years of play.&lt;ref name="Enquirer Kaufman" /&gt;

On December 18, 1978, OHSAA's 661 member schools defeated a proposal that would have split schools into separate divisions for the 564 public schools and 97 parochial and private schools.&lt;ref name="Enquirer Holtz"&gt;{{cite news|title=Out-Of-State Into Court|first=Randy|last=Holtz|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=August 15, 1980|page=C4|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/101410107/|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parochial, Private School Division Split Considered|first=Ray|last=Buck|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=June 15, 1978|page=D1|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/101637124/|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they voted 65.1% in favor of adopting [[By-law|bylaw]] 4, section 6.4–6.10 (originally known as rule 92G), which states in part: "A student whose parents live in another state will be ineligible for athletics in an Ohio member school."&lt;ref name="Dover"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prep out-of-state rule tested|agency=Associated Press|location=Dover, Ohio|work=[[The Times-Reporter]]|volume=81|issue=75|date=October 5, 1983|page=C-2|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/dover-times-reporter-oct-05-1983-p-14/|via=NewspaperARCHIVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="District" /&gt; The rule took effect for incoming ninth graders in July 1979. It primarily affected schools in [[Cincinnati]] and [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], where out-of-state athletes had traditionally competed.&lt;ref name="Enquirer Holtz" /&gt; In the Cincinnati area, the new rule affected [[St. Xavier High School (Cincinnati)|St. Xavier High School]], [[Moeller High School]], [[Summit Country Day School]], [[Cincinnati Country Day School]], and [[Seven Hills School]].&lt;ref name="Enquirer Paolercio imported"&gt;{{cite news|title=Imported Athletes Kept Out|first=Michael|last=Paolercio|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=September 30, 1980|page=A1|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/101210177/|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. Xavier High School (Cincinnati), stadium entrance.jpg|thumb|left|The flags of three states fly outside St. Xavier's football stadium.]]

Unlike the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archdiocese of Cincinnati]]'s interparochial high schools, St. Xavier was a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school not subject to parochial boundaries; it drew students from nearby communities in Southeastern Indiana and [[Northern Kentucky]] in addition to Southwestern Ohio.&lt;ref name="Alerding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dover" /&gt; In the 1950s, up to a third of St. Xavier students were Kentuckians.&lt;ref name="Enquirer Pulfer"&gt;{{cite news|title=Court Upholds High School Ban Against Non-Ohio Athletes|first1=Mike|last1=Pulfer|first2=Ben L.|last2=Kaufman|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=December 18, 1985|page=C1, C6|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/101770582/|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;!-- https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/101770597/--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of St. Xavier's most best-known alumni were star athletes while living in Kentucky, including [[Jim Bunning]], [[Bob Arnzen]], and [[Charles Wolf (basketball)|Charlie Wolf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St. X Tradition Dies Bitterly in N.

In 1980, the parents of eight Northern Kentucky students who had been admitted to St. Xavier, including Tom Menke and Danny Mueller, sued OHSAA in Hamilton County [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] because the students would be banned from competition under bylaw 4-6-10. The common pleas court let the rule stand, and a [[Ohio District Courts of Appeals|state appellate court]] upheld the decision in September 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Menke v.

Dennis C. Alerding resided in [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky]], and attended St. Xavier as a sophomore. Three Moellering brothers lived in [[Lakeside Park, Kentucky]], and also attended St. Xavier: David R., a junior, Douglas R., a sophomore, and Gregory R., a freshman. All were ineligible to participate in the school's athletic programs due to bylaw 4-6-10.&lt;ref name="Enquirer Howard"&gt;{{cite news|title=OHSAA Out-Of-State Rule Tested in Court|first=Allen|last=Howard|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=October 5, 1983|page=B4|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/103326822/|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Was OHSAA unfair in banning 4 players?|agency=Associated Press|work=[[BG News]]|location=Bowling Green, Ohio|volume=68|issue=16|date=September 20, 1985|page=7|url=https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5421&amp;context=bg-news#page=8|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alerding practiced with the wrestling team but could not participate in meets, while David Moellering had wanted to play baseball or basketball.&lt;ref name="Enquirer Pulfer" /&gt; In October 1983, their fathers, F. Dennis Alerding and Roger H. Moellering, filed suit against OHSAA and St. Xavier in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio]], alleging that the bylaw violated the four students' constitutional right to a complete education. They sought a temporary [[injunction]] before the end of the winter athletic season and a [[declaratory judgment]] against the ban. The plaintiffs noted that ''Menke'' did not concern the constitutionality of the bylaw&lt;ref name="Enquirer Gutsell" /&gt; and cited a passage in the OHSAA constitution, which read in part: "Competitive sports are an inherent part of the total education program for students in secondary schools."&lt;ref name="Alerding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dover" /&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
The case came before the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio]]. On November 23, 1983, Judge  [[S. Arthur Spiegel]] denied the temporary restraining order because Alerding and Moellering would have known about the ban prior to enrolling their sons at St. Xavier, and because the order would have forced part of the 1983–84 season to be played under temporary rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Students Lose 1st Bid To Play In Ohio|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=November 23, 1983|page=A8|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/101717738/|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 5, 1984, Judge Spiegel heard the case for three hours, then asked attorneys for the plaintiffs to return with information on how [[Michigan]], Indiana, Kentucky, [[West Virginia]], and [[Pennsylvania]] treat out-of-state student-athletes.&lt;ref name="Enquirer Kaufman" /&gt;

On August 20, 1984, the district court found that the OHSAA bylaw could be considered a state action. However, citing ''[[San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez]]'' and the recent ''[[United Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v. Mayor and Council of Camden|Camden]]'' case, the court ruled that interscholastic high school athletics was not protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause, reasoning that school athletics pales in comparison to the employment opportunities that the clause often concerns. Given that the courts had ruled educational opportunity not to be a fundamental privilege, extracurricular activities could not be considered fundamental either. The court acknowledged that educational opportunities may be a prerequisite for employment opportunities, but considered the impact of the bylaw to be a matter of degree. Based on these findings, the court denied the plaintiffs' requests for an injunction and declaratory judgment.&lt;ref name="District"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Alerding v. Ohio High School Athletic Association|vol=591|reporter=F.Supp.|opinion=1538|court=S.D. Ohio|date=August 20, 1984|accessdate=May 20, 2018|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/591/1538/2388721/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, State Representative [[Dave Karmol]] of Toledo introduced a bill that would have prohibited OHSAA from considering a student's state of residence in determining eligibility. Karmol said that Toledo-area schools, both public and private, supported the measure, but the bill did not advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Hits At Out-Of-State Recruiting Ban|first=Randy|last=Holtz|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=June 12, 1980|page=D6|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/101633824/|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alerding and Moellering appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]], arguing that ''Rodriguez'' pertained to the [[Equal Protection Clause]] rather than the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and that the court should consider instead whether the bylaw was related to OHSAA's objective of eliminating unfair recruiting. On December 17, 1985, the appellate court disagreed with both aspects of the appeal and affirmed the district court's ruling, allowing OHSAA's bylaw to stand.&lt;ref name="Alerding" /&gt; By then, St. Xavier had 1,250 students, and the number of students from Kentucky had fallen to 35.

==Impact==
''Alerding'' has been cited in later cases to show that the actions of state high school athletic associations, such as OHSAA, are considered to be state action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Alston v. Virginia High School League|vol=144|reporter=F.Supp. 2d|opinion=526|court=W.D. Va.|date=1999|page=19|url=http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/opinions/michael/397cv095msj.pdf#page=21|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OHSAA bylaw 4-6-10 barring out-of-state students remains in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residence Bylaw Resource Center|publisher=Ohio High School Athletic Association|accessdate=May 20, 2018|url=http://www.ohsaa.org/Eligibility/Residence-Bylaw-Resource-Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 article in the ''Journal of Law and Education'' suggests that restrictions such as OHSAA's bylaw, as affirmed by the Sixth Circuit, should be revisited in light of the increasing importance of school athletics in future career prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Third and Goal: High School Athletic Association Restrictions and the Privileges and Immunities Clause|first=Rachel|last=Dalton|work=Journal of Law &amp; Education|publisher=[[University of South Carolina School of Law]]|volume=44|issue=4|date=Fall 2015|issn=0275-6072|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3887369431/third-and-goal-high-school-athletic-association-restrictions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the prohibition on out-of-state students, OHSAA's public member schools continued to complain that private schools and public open enrollment schools enjoyed an unfair advantage over public schools by drawing students from a broader geographic area than conventional school district boundaries. In May 2014, a majority of member school principals rejected a plan to hold separate district, regional, and state championships for public schools and private schools, similar to the proposal that failed in 1978. Instead, they voted to institute a "competitive balance" plan that took effect for six major sports during the 2017–18 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=OHSAA announces plan to implement competitive balance in 2017-2018 school year|first=Michael|last=Beaven|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|publisher=GateHouse Media|date=January 28, 2016|accessdate=May 20, 2018|url=https://www.ohio.com/akron/sports/ohsaa-announces-plan-to-implement-competitive-balance-in-2017-2018-school-year}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Army Navy Match''' is the annual rugby union match played between the senior XV teams of the [[Royal Navy]] and [[British Army]]. It marks the culmination of the annual Inter-Services Competition. Although a match was played between the [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] of the [[British Army]] and the officers of the [[Royal Navy]] at [[The Oval]], London on 13 February 1878, it was not until 1907 that the Army Navy Match became an annual fixture.  For the first fixture the match Secretary was Surg Lt George Levick RN. From 1909 it was jointly administered by the newly formed [[Royal Navy Rugby Union]] (RNRU – 1907) &lt;ref&gt;The Army and Navy Gazette 16 Nov 1907&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Army Rugby Union]] (ARU – 1906). Since then it has been played every season, with the exception of during the world wars (1914–19 and 1940–45) when the matches were suspended.

==Brief Background==
Traditionally the Army Navy match has been played in the second half of the domestic season but in season 1907/1908 it was played in December and due to this anomaly the calendar year 1908 did not see an Army Navy match played yet they played each other twice in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navyrugby.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 Army Navy was the 99th in the series and the match saw another new record crowd of 81323 watch the Army Navy match which was one of the most compelling ever.  The Navy took the lead 7–0 (Dave Fairbrother) on 20 minutes before the Army scored three tries (Semesa Rokoduguni 2, Owain Davies)  before half time to lead 19–7 at the beak.  A further try for the Army (James Farrell) early in the second period saw them extend their lead to 26-7 with half an hour of the match remaining.  The Royal Navy staged the most remarkable of comebacks with tries from Gareth Rees and Rhys Dymmock-WIlliams either side of a penalty try to level the scores at 26-26 with 9 minutes remaining.  An Owain Davies penalty with 2 minutes to go seemed to seal the win for the Army before Royal Navy fullback landed a 45m penalty of his own to again tie the game 29–29 with less than a minute to go.  The draw meant that the Army Navy Trophy was shared but he Royal Navy were Inter Service Champions having beaten the RAF 9–8 at USSG Portsmouth.  The RAF had beaten the Army 13–12 at RAF Halton in the opening round of the Inter Services. Royal Navy Number 8 completed a remarkable game which included a try, a yellow card and being named Man of the Match.&lt;ref&gt;http://navyrugby.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 Army Navy match was unable to live up to the onfield excitement from the year before.  However the 100th match saw another record crowd (81577), the attendance of Prince Harry as Patron of the Match Chairty, Invictus Games Foundation, and an Army win 29-20.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navyrugby.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The 101st Army Navy Match was played at Twickenham on 5 May 2018 with the Army winning 22-14. The match was notable in that the Navy had one man sent off in the first ten minutes of the game and the Army took advantage of their wing overlap to good effect. Army Corporal Matthew Dawson was awarded the Babcock Man of the Match.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armynavymatch.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== The First Army Navy game 1878 ==
The first Army vs Navy game was held on 13 February 1878. A contemporary newspaper '''''The Broad Arrow''''' gave the following account of the match:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''A fine exhibition of football delighted the somewhat small number of spectators. Bush scored the first try for the Navy from a scrummage near the line. The goal was kicked by Orford. A band of naval spectators who had taken up their position beneath a white ensign mounted on the roof of a drag greeted this score with great cheering. The greasy state of the ground was not favourable for any great display of running. Encouraged by a cry from their supporters 'Come on Navy, Force the Passage of the Straights' the Navy mounted great pressure and scored a touch down. In the second half the Navy scored a second try. Wrench of the Army took advantage of some bad passing by the Navy and scored the Army try: The goal was kicked but this ended the scoring and the Navy deservedly won the first match between the Services.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The full version of the report from the Broad Arrow seems to suggest that the correct quote of 'Force the Passage of the Straits' was used.&lt;ref&gt;http://navyrugby.co.uk/history-of-the-union/historical-events/1878-the-first-first-match/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army selectors made a generous contribution towards the Navy victory by selecting a Royal Artillery officer, R Bannatyne, as Team Captain. He was serving overseas at the time and received no notification of his selection. As a result, he was absent for the game. The situation was further confounded by the fact that another Army player arrived late and missed a good part of the match.

== The First "Official" Army Navy game 1907 ==
The Army Rugby Union was formed in 1906 whilst the exact date of formation of the Royal Navy Rugby Union is shrouded in doubt but is likely to have been towards the end of 1907, after the 1st official Army v Navy Match.  February 1907 was when the first match organised by the two Services in a formal manner was played, with Surg Lt George Levick RN acting as the Match Secretary.  The match was held at the Queen's Club, West Kensington and was won by the Officers of the Royal Navy 15-14.&lt;ref&gt;http://navyrugby.co.uk/history-of-the-union/historical-events/1907-the-second-first-match/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was played at Queen's Club until 1914.  After the First World War the first match was hosted by Twickenham in 1920 and the game has been played there ever since.&lt;ref&gt;http://navyrugby.co.uk/senior-xv/senior-xv-inter-service-results/senior-xv-v-army/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Team colours ==
Navy - Navy blue shorts, socks and shirt.

Army - White shorts, red shirt and socks.

In the first match of 1878 the Army played in white.  The Navy have always played in blue jerseys though in 1955 their shorts were white.&lt;ref&gt;http://navyrugby.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anniversary Army Navy Matches ==
The first eight matches were played at Queen's Club.  Currently the 101 matches have resulted in 62 Army wins, 35 Navy wins and 4 draws which includes the thrilling 29-29 draw in 2016.  The Royal Navy won the first match in 1907 but the Army have won the other anniversary matches.  On 7 March 1936 the Army won the 25th match 12-3, in 1967 they won the 50th match 6-3, in 1992 they won the 75th match 16-9 and in 2017 they won the 100th match 29-20&lt;ref&gt;http://navyrugby.co.uk/senior-xv/senior-xv-inter-service-results/senior-xv-v-army/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The first match that was an official Army Navy Match was in 1907 after the Army Rugby Union had formed in 1906 and with the Royal Navy moving towards formation.  The match Secretary was Surg Lt George Levick and there was a charge for entry. The matches in 1878, 1880, 1905  and 1906 do not count towards the official record of matches between the  two sides with February 1907 being the first and the 29 April 2017 the 100th match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://navyrugby.co.uk/royal-navy-rugby-union/history-of-the-union/historical-events/1907-the-second-first-match/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602050635/http://navyrugby.co.uk/royal-navy-rugby-union/history-of-the-union/historical-events/1907-the-second-first-match/ |archive-date=2016-06-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inter-Services Championship (1920 to present day) ===

In 1920 a Tri-Service competition was created to include the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF). However, the great rivalry between the Army and Navy has continued and their match, now held at the home of the English Rugby Football Union (Twickenham Stadium), remains the highlight of the annual inter-services rugby competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafrugbyunion/interservices/sstats.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aru.org.uk/aru-history-interservice.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224192028/http://www.aru.org.uk/aru-history-interservice.htm |archivedate=2008-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2010 is the only occasion that an Inter Service match has not taken place for a reason apart from World War.  The RAF v Army match was cancelled as the Army were stranded in their overseas training camp in South Africa due to flight disruptions caused by the [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull]].

== Ladies Inter-Services Championship (2003-) ==

Since 2003 the women from the three Armed Services have been fielding their own rugby teams and have been competing in an annual inter-service competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafrugbyunion/interservices/lstats.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aru.org.uk/aru-history-women.htm#interservice |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224182733/http://www.aru.org.uk/aru-history-women.htm |archivedate=2008-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alliginphotography.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bethpage Ballpark''' is a 6,002-seat [[baseball park]] in [[Central Islip, New York]] that serves as the home of the [[Long Island Ducks]], an independent minor league baseball team that is a member of the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]].  Its first regular season game took place on May 14, 2000, when the Ducks played host to the [[Aberdeen Arsenal]]. The game was the first in the history of both franchises, as they both entered the Atlantic League at the same time.  Bethpage Ballpark hosted the 2002 and 2010 Atlantic League All-Star Games.

==Naming rights==
On July 17, 2001, [[Citigroup]] acquired European American Bank (EAB) for $1.6 billion and $350 million in preferred stock.  The acquisition resulted in a name change from EAB Park to Citibank Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citi.com/citigroup/corporate/history/eab.htm Citigroup acquires EAB]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Citigroup ended its corporate sponsorship in the spring of 2010 and the ballpark was given the temporary name "Suffolk County Sports Park" for the 2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/citibank-ends-sponsorship-of-li-ducks-stadium-1.1731759|title=Citibank ends sponsorship of LI Ducks' stadium |last=Baumbach|first=Jim|date=January 29, 2010|newspaper=Newsday|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2010, [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] officials agreed to a $2.1 million deal with [[Bethpage Federal Credit Union]] to name the stadium "Bethpage Ballpark"  until the 2020 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/long-island-now-1.1732330/a-new-name-for-ducks-ballpark-1.2543566|title=A new name for Ducks' ballpark |last=Sullivan|first=Joseph|date=December 15, 2010|newspaper=Newsday|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballpark attractions==

The '''Champagne Stakes''' is a [[Conditions races|Group 2]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in Great Britain open to two-year-old [[Colt (horse)|colts]] and [[gelding]]s. It is run at [[Doncaster Racecourse|Doncaster]] over a distance of 7 furlongs and 6 yards (1,414 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.

==History==
The event was established in 1823, and it was originally open to horses of either gender. For a period it was contested over a mile, and it was shortened to 6 furlongs in 1870. It was extended to 7 furlongs in 1962, and restricted to male horses in 1988.

The Champagne Stakes is held during Doncaster's four-day St. Leger Festival, and it is currently run on the final day, the same day as the [[St Leger Stakes]].

The leading horses from the race sometimes go on to compete in the following month's [[Dewhurst Stakes]].

'''Double Dutch''' is a game in which two long [[jump ropes]] turning in opposite directions are jumped by one or more players jumping simultaneously. It is believed to have originated among Dutch immigrants in New York City, and is now popular worldwide.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119448972267686072|title=Bested by Japan, A Jump-Rope Team Plots a Comeback|date=9 November 2007|author=Jamin Brophy-Warren|work=WSJ|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it had long been a popular street activity for African American girls in New York City, the modern sport of Double Dutch originated in the early 1970s with [[NYPD]] officers Ulysses Williams and David Walker, who formalized the rules for competition. The first official competition was held in 1974. In the early 1980s, Double Dutch was strongly associated with New York [[hip hop]] culture.&lt;ref name=vice&gt;Lauren Schwartzberg, [https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nn974m/double-dutchs-forgotten-hip-hop-origins-456 Double Dutch's Forgotten Hip-Hop Origins], vice.com, April 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;Competitions in double Dutch range from block parties to the world level. During the spring of 2009, double Dutch became a varsity sport in New York City public high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/education/31double.html|title=Double Dutch Gets Status in the Schools|date=31 July 2008|author=Hu, Winnie|publisher=''New York Times''|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing double Dutch involves at least three people: one or more jumping, and two turning the ropes. A jumper usually performs tricks that may involve [[gymnastics]] or [[breakdance]], and may also incorporate fancy foot movements.

== Double Dutch in France ==
Double Dutch is associated with the early French [[hip-hop]] scene.  It was introduced in late 1982 when the World Champion Fantastic Four double dutch team came to France along with the NYC Rap Tour.  Groups such as the Dutch Force System, Ladie's Night, and Crétil were some of the better-known double Dutch groups.  Double Dutch was seen as ''"the symbol of a strong and affirmed femininity in hip-hop" ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Piolet |first=Vincent |date=June 2015 |title=Regarde ta jeunesse dans les yeux: naissance du hip-hop française, 1980-1990 |location=France|publisher=Horizon |page=90 |isbn=9782360541676|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In gladiator chess no draws are accepted. In case the game ends in a draw, it is played again with reversed colors and shorter time limits. Specifically the first game is played so that each player has 100 minutes for 40 moves and then 30 minutes, always adding 30 seconds per move. In case of a draw, the time settings are changed to 25 minutes, adding 10 seconds per move. In case of another draw, the players will continue to play [[blitz chess]], 10 minutes per player, adding 5 seconds per move.

The '''Hellinikon Olympic Softball Stadium''' is a [[softball]] [[stadium]] located in the [[Hellinikon Olympic Complex]] in [[Athens]]. It hosted the [[Softball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|softball]] competitions during the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]]. The venue consists of a main softball field of 4,800 seats - though only 3,400 seats were made publicly available during the games - and 2 warm-up fields nearby. Construction on the facility was completed on 29 February 2004, and it was officially opened on 30 July 2004.

Softball however, has not been played at the stadium since the end of the 2004 Olympic Games. One minder of the stadium commented that, "The softball [stadium] is in perfect working order. It is not abandoned. It's just that nobody ever plays softball".&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/the-2004-olympic-legacy-that-london-must-avoid-6868504.html" Retrieved on 6 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium has since fallen into disuse and disrepair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/olympics/28693970 Olympics: Athens venues lie empty as tenth anniversary nears], BBC Sport, 7 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Jolly Darkie Target Game''''' was a game developed and manufactured by the [[McLoughlin Brothers]] (now part of [[Milton Bradley Company]]){{sfn|Congdon-Martin|1990|p=46}} which was released in 1890.{{sfn|Booker|2000|p=124}} It was produced until at least 1915.{{sfn|Washington Afro-American|1986}} 

==Description==
The objective of the game was to throw a wooden ball into a [[Bullseye (target)|bullseye]], the "gaping mouth" of the target in cardboard decorated using imagery of [[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]]{{sfn|Booker|2000|p=124}}{{sfn|Turner|1994|p=11}} and that could open and close.{{sfn|Tompkins|2012|p=194}} It was one of many products and media of late 19th century in the United States depicting [[African American]]s as "beasts" and associating the black male face Sambo images with [[List of ethnic slurs|racial slur]] terms such as "coon", "darky", "[[nigger]]", and "[[pickaninny]]".{{sfn|Booker|2000|p=124}} Among these was another Milton Bradley game, ''Darky's Coon Game''.{{sfn|Booker|2000|p=124}} The term "darkie" referred to the "exaggerated physiognomic features" depicting black people and associated with [[minstrel show]]s.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=23|loc=From minstrel paraphernalia and games to minstrel shows}} In the book ''Ceramic Uncles &amp; Celluloid Mammies: Black Images and Their Influence on Culture'', Patricia Turner reported that she had heard of a black man sitting outside a theatre preceding a minstrel show, with his mouth open and children throwing balls into it for entertainment.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=23|loc=From minstrel paraphernalia and games to minstrel shows}} The Cuban poet and journalist [[José Martí]] witnessed a similar scene at [[Coney Island]] and wrote about it.{{sfn|Arroyo|2013|p=199|loc=Note 78}}

It was one of many games produced at the time with a theme involving violence against black people, who were "encountering growing hostility" throughout the United States.{{sfn|Congdon-Martin|1990|p=16}} Another was "Hit the Dodger! Knock him Out!".{{sfn|Congdon-Martin|1990|p=16}} It was also one of the objects produced at the time featuring a mouth and "black ingestion" as a [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotype of African Americans]], such as the [[watermelon stereotype]], also exemplified by the "Jolly Nigger Bank" into which coins are inserted into a mouth-shaped slot.{{sfn|Tompkins|2012|p=194}} The target consumer for the game was white people, who bought it for their children.{{sfn|Washington Afro-American|1986}}{{sfn|Turner|1994|p=11}} These games and images reinforced "an encompassing theme of domination" by white people and subordination of black people.{{sfn|Ross Barnett|1982|p=44}} Turner states that such products reflected means by which "American consumers found acceptable ways of buying and selling the souls of black folk" even after the abolition of [[slavery in the United States]], and the use of black images in advertising "figured prominently in commodity capitalism".{{sfn|Hill Collins|2006|p=314|loc=Note 2}}

Today, the game is considered a collector's item.{{sfn|Dant|1999|p=150}} It is part of [[collectable]] black memorabilia, consisting of objects such as dolls, toys, and postcards that include those that are offensive or racist,{{sfn|Washington Afro-American|1986}} even the "most contemptible examples" of such works.{{sfn|Markovich|2000|p=11}} By 1993, there were about 50,000 black memorabilia collectors in the United States, about 70% of whom were African Americans.{{sfn|Gutloff|1993|p=36}}

'''Ko'sso''' is a fast-paced ball game played by the [[Afar people|Afar]] people. The [[ball]] is made up of rolled goatskins.  The object of the game is to keep the ball away from players on the opposing [[team]]. In the past, Ko'sso teams could be quite large; in fact, they could be made up of over one hundred players.  There is still no set number of players per team.

[[Wilfred Thesiger]] describes a very similar games played by the Afar which he calls '''gaso'''. However, his description varies from Ko'sso in that there are no teams—every player is against all others—and once the ball is taken out of the reach of the other players, the player in control of the ball then must bounce it and catch it on the back of his hand.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Thesiger, ''The Danakil Diary: Journeys through Abyssinia, 1930-4'' (Hammersmith: Flamingo, 1996), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8454">[[File:Morgnshtern symbol.png|thumb|''Morgnsthern'' symbol]]'''''Morgnshtern''''' (מאָרגןשטערן, [[Yiddish]] for 'Morning Star', sometimes also known by its [[Polish language|Polish]] name ''Jutrznia'') was a Jewish sports organisation in [[interbellum]] [[Poland]], politically linked to the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Bund]]. It was founded in the end of 1926. ''Morgnshtern'' increased significantly in influence in the period just preceding the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, Michael, and Gideon Reuveni. ''Emancipation Through Muscles: Jews and Sports in Europe''. [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]]: University of Nebraska Press, 2006. p. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 the organisation had 107 local branches in different parts of the country. Its largest branch was based in [[Warsaw]]. In 1936, the Warsaw branch had 956 active members, in 1937 he membership reached around 1500 (making it the largest local sporting organisation in Poland) and 1855 in 1938.&lt;ref name="emm"&gt;Brenner, Michael, and Gideon Reuveni. ''Emancipation Through Muscles: Jews and Sports in Europe''. [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]]: University of Nebraska Press, 2006. p. 97, 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kug2"&gt;Kugelmass, Jack. ''Jews, Sports, and the Rites of Citizenship''. [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]: University of Illinois Press, 2007. p. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

''Morgnshtern'' was repeatedly targeted by the Polish authorities; between 1929 and 1934, 23 local ''Morgnshtern'' branches were closed down. In 1937 ''Morgnshtern'' had prepared a delegation to take part in the Workers Olympics in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], but the Polish government refused to give travel visas to the athletes.&lt;ref name="kug2"/&gt;

The development of socialist sports was markedly affected by the rise of [[fascism]] in [[Europe]]. The socialist sport movement took a more paramilitary character, in order to mobilize anti-fascist defense. In the case of ''Morgnshtern'', the Bund already had experiences from organizing militias against [[pogroms]]. Bernand Goldstein, the president of the ''Morgnshtern'' in Warsaw was also the chief of the Bundist Defense Corps (Goldstein himself did however later downplay his role in ''Morgnshtern'', stating that the presidency was merely an honorary position).&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, Michael, and Gideon Reuveni. ''Emancipation Through Muscles: Jews and Sports in Europe''. [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]]: University of Nebraska Press, 2006. p. 53, 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

''Morgnshtern'' ceased to function as Poland was occupied by [[Germany]]. Many of the athletes of the organisation became resistance fighters during the war.&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt; ''Morgnshtern'' was revived after the war.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Labor Bund Bulletin'', Vol II, No 16-17, April-May, 1949. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Warsaw "Jutrznia-Morgnshtern" is the only remaining ''Morgnshtern'' branch.{{fact|date=November 2013}}

==Socialist sporting==
[[File:Morgnsthern meeting, 1937.png|thumb|''Morgnsthern'' meeting, 1937]]''Morgnshtern'' espoused principles of [[socialist]] sporting, seeking to promote proletarian camaraderie and collective achievements, rather than individual competition. These principles had been formulated in the book ''Sport und Politik'' ('Sports and Politics') by [[Julius Deutsch]]. Initially the organisation mainly organised sports were large numbers of people could participate at the same time, such as [[cycling]], [[gymnastics]] and [[hiking]].&lt;ref name="ema"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kugelmass"&gt;Kugelmass, Jack. ''Jews, Sports, and the Rites of Citizenship''. [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]: University of Illinois Press, 2007. p. 115-116&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular activity of ''Morgnshtern'' was gymnastics. This was followed by ''ritmika'' ([[eurythmics]]), which mainly had female participants.&lt;ref name="sport"&gt;http://www.vcn.bc.ca/outlook/library/articles/jewsontheleft/p05SocialistSports.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in order to increase recruitment the organisation eventually began opening up for more individually oriented competitive sports such as [[association football|football]], [[table tennis]] and [[boxing]].&lt;ref name="ema"/&gt; ''Morgnshtern'', although officially disliking football as a sport which glorified individual champions, had a few football teams affiliated to it already in the 1920s. Still though, compared to the ''[[Shtern]]'' federation of the [[Poale Zion Left]] or bourgeois Jewish sports organisations, ''Morgnshtern'' put very little emphasis on football.&lt;ref name="kugelmass"/&gt; In 1930 the Central Organising Committee of ''Morgnshtern'' adopted a resolution on the 'football question', which concluded that the sport could be collective and inclusive if addressed in the right way. In the early 1930s, there were several football teams in Warsaw city affiliated to ''Morgnshtern''. Following the adoption of the 1930 football resolution, the organisation began forming teams for table tennis (a ''Morgnshtern'' athlete formed part of the Polish national delegation at the 1938 [[World Table Tennis Championships|World Championship]] in [[London]]), [[Team handball|handball]], [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]].&lt;ref name="sport"/&gt;

The organisation was even more vocally opposed to boxing, and had proposed banning boxing from the Socialist Workers' Sport International at the 1929 SWSI congress.&lt;ref&gt;Kugelmass, Jack. ''Jews, Sports, and the Rites of Citizenship''. [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]: University of Illinois Press, 2007. p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Warsaw branch of ''Morgnshtern'' set up a boxing club in late December 1935, which was rather successful in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="emm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sport"/&gt;

==Relations with ZRSS and SWSI==
A delegation of ''Morgnshtern'' participated in the 1927 congress of the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International]].&lt;ref name="ema"&gt;Brenner, Michael, and Gideon Reuveni. ''Emancipation Through Muscles: Jews and Sports in Europe''. [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]]: University of Nebraska Press, 2006. p. 51-53&lt;/ref&gt; ''Morgnshtern'' had a complicated relationship with the [[Polish Workers' Sport Federation]] (ZRSS), due to political antagonism between the Bund and the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (which dominated the ZRSS). The two organisations clashes at the 1929 [[Prague]] congress of the Socialist Workers' Sports International, as ''Morgnshtern'' demanded to be recognized as a separate section and not as an affiliate of the Polish ZRSS. In the end, the congress accepted the demand. ''Morgnshtern'' sent its own delegation to the 1931 Workers Olympics in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="kug2"/&gt;

==Cultural and social activities==
[[Image:Morgnshtern1934.jpg|thumb|''Morgnshtern'' members at a pier, during a sailing trip from Warsaw to [[Gdynia]].]]Apart from physical training, ''Morgnshtern'' also organized cultural activities. A [[mandolin]] orchestra and a theatre group were run by ''Morgnshtern'' in [[Vilna]]. The ''Morgnshtern'' branch in Warsaw organized visits to cinemas and theatres.&lt;ref name="yivo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yivoinstitute.org/downloads/sports_overview.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615185844/http://www.yivoinstitute.org/downloads/sports_overview.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summers ''Morgnshtern'' would rent a swimming pool, and offer swimming lessons to its members. In the winters, from 1933 onwards, the organisation had an ice-skating rink in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="sport"/&gt;

==Name==
{{Jewish Labour Bund}}
The full name of the organization was ''Arbeter gezelshaft far fizisher dertsiung "morgnshtern" in poyln'' in Yiddish, and ''Robotnicze Stowarzyszenie Wychowania Fizycznego "Jutrznia" w Polsce'' in Polish. After the 1929 congress of the Socialist Workers' Sport International, the organisation added and 'Jewish section of the Workers' Sports International' (''yidishe sektsie fun arbeter sport internatsional'') to its name.&lt;ref name="kug2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kug123"&gt;Kugelmass, Jack. ''Jews, Sports, and the Rites of Citizenship''. [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]: University of Illinois Press, 2007. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem==
The emblem of ''Morgnshtern'' featured a [[javelin throw]]er, illustrated in the style of a classic Greek statue, in front of belching smokestacks. The emblem also had the name of the organisation in Yiddish and Polish.&lt;ref name="kug123"/&gt;

The '''National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame''' was founded in 1951 in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], to honor the achievements of [[United States|American]] [[thoroughbred horse racing|Thoroughbred race horse]]s, [[jockey]]s, and [[Horse trainer|trainers]]. In 1955, the museum moved to its current location on Union Avenue near [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga race course]], at which time inductions into the hall of fame began. Each spring, following the tabulation of the final votes, the announcement of new inductees is made, usually during [[Kentucky Derby]] Week in early May. The actual inductions are held in mid-August during the [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga]] race meeting.

The Hall of Fame's nominating committee selects eight to ten candidates from among the four Contemporary categories (male horse, female horse, jockey and trainer) to be presented to the voters. Changes in voting procedures that commenced with the 2010 candidates allow the voters to choose multiple candidates from a single Contemporary category, instead of a single candidate from each of the four Contemporary categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=4962597|title=Racing Hall of Fame changes voting procedures|date=3 March 2010|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2016, two female horses (Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta) were inducted at the same time.

The museum also houses a large collection of art, artifacts, and memorabilia that document the history of horse racing from the eighteenth century to the present.

==History==
The museum first opened its doors in 1951, at which time it occupied a single room in Saratoga's [[Canfield Casino]]. The establishment was supported by the city of [[Saratoga Springs]], which donated $2,500, the Saratoga Racing Association, which donated $5,000, and various patrons of the sport, who also donated various pieces of art and memorabilia. The first item in the museum's collection was a horseshoe worn by the great [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]].&lt;ref name="EvolvedPt1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goode |first1=Kristen Ingwell |title=Racing's Hall of Fame Evolved From Humble Beginnings |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192192/racings-hall-of-fame-evolved-from-humble-beginnings |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the museum relocated to its current location on Union Avenue, close to the main entrance of [[Saratoga Race Course]]. Inductions into the hall of fame began at the same time. Since then, the museum has expanded several times to allow for the display of its extensive art collection and more multimedia displays on the history of the sport.&lt;ref name=EvolvedPt1 /&gt;

==Horses in the Hall of Fame==
[[File:HorseracingHallofFame.jpg|thumb|The Hall of Fame gallery at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga]]
In the early years, inductions to the hall of fame were based on the evaluation of a panel of racing historians. In 1955, a group of 9 horses from the earliest years of the American turf were inducted.&lt;ref name="EvolvedPt2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hall of Fame: Humble Beginnings (Cont.) |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192191/hall-of-fame-humble-beginnings-cont |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1956 class included 11 horses that raced around the turn of the century, while the 1957 class included 10 horses that raced up to the mid-thirties. Since then, the classes have been significantly smaller as the inductions shifted to more contemporary horses. Under current rules, a horse must have been retired for a minimum of five full calendar years to be eligible for the hall of fame. Thoroughbreds remain eligible in the contemporary category between five and 25 calendar years following their final racing year. Thoroughbreds retired for more than 25 calendar years may become eligible through the Historic Review Committee.&lt;ref name=EvolvedPt1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eligibility&gt;{{cite web|title=Eligibility, Nomination and Election - National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|url=https://www.racingmuseum.org/eligibility-nomination-and-election|website=www.racingmuseum.org|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jockeys in the Hall of fame==
Contemporary [[jockey]]s become eligible for the Hall of Fame after they have been licensed for at least 20 years, and remain eligible until 25 years after retirement. In special circumstances such as fragile health, the 20 year requirement may be waived, though there is usually a five year waiting period after retirement in such cases.&lt;ref name=Eligibility /&gt;

'''La Liga Nicaragüense de Beisbol Profesional (LNBP)''' was inaugurated on March 30, 1956, in Estadio Nacional. The first game was between the teams from San Fernando and Bóer. The [[Nicaragua]]n public's excitement for baseball grew as foreign [[professional baseball|professional]] teams and foreign players came to play in their country. Due to economic difficulty, the [[sports league|league]] had to shut down in 1967. The teams from Bóer and León were the most successful teams in those years with three championships each. The professional league was re-established in 2004.

'''Parkour''' ({{IPA-fr|paʁkuʁ|lang}}) is a [[Training#Physical training|training]] discipline using movement that developed from military [[obstacle course]] training.&lt;ref name="CineP20"&gt;[[#Angel|Angel]], pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pkgen-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parkourgenerations.com/parkour-history/ |title=Parkour History |date=22 August 2014 |publisher=Parkour Generations |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYwQLvIkQ88 |title=Interview with David Belle |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners aim to get from one point to another in a complex environment, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Parkour includes running, climbing, [[:wikt:swinging|swinging]], [[vault (urban movement)|vaulting]], jumping, [[roll (gymnastics)|rolling]], [[crawling (human)|quadrupedal movement]] (crawling) and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation.&lt;ref name="Ferrari"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ferrari |first=Matthew |title=From 'Play to Display': Parkour as Media-Mimetics or Nature Reclamation? |work=FlowTV, vol 11, lokaliseret den 01-04-2011 på |url=http://flowtv.org/2010/05/from-"play-to-display"-parkour-as-media-mimetics-or-nature-reclamation-matthew-ferrari-university-of-massachusetts-amherst|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freitas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Feitas |first=Elizabeth |title=Parkour and the Built Environment: Spatial Practices and the Plasticity of School Buildings |year=2011 |journal=Journal of Curriculum Theorizing |issue=3|volume=27|url=http://journal.jctonline.org/index.php/jct/article/view/126 |page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parkour's development from military training gives it some aspects of a non-combative [[Martial arts|martial art]].

Parkour is as an activity that can be practiced alone or with others and is usually carried out in urban spaces, though it can be done anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rawlinson |first1=Christopher |last2=Guaralda |first2=Mirko |date=11 September 2012 |contribution=Chaos and creativity of play: designing emotional engagement in public spaces| title=In Out of Control: 8th International Conference on Design and Emotion| location=Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design, London |url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/51313/ |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00146-010-0294-2| title = Nice-looking obstacles: Parkour as urban practice of deterritorialization| journal = AI &amp; Society| volume = 26| issue = 2| pages = 143–152| year = 2010| last1 = Brunner | first1 = C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parkour involves seeing one's environment in a new way, and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Rawlinson |first1=Christopher |last2=Guaralda |first2=Mirko |date=27 April 2011 |contribution=Play in the city: Parkour and architecture| title=The First International Postgraduate Conference on Engineering, Designing and Developing the Built Environment for Sustainable Wellbeing |location=Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia |url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/42506/ |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Ameel |first1=L. |last2=Tani |first2=S. |year=2012 |title=Everyday aesthetics in action: Parkour Eyes and the beauty of concrete walls |journal=Emotion, Space and Society |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkour was developed in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son [[David Belle|David]] and the latter's group of friends, the self-styled ''[[Yamakasi]]'', during the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |first=David |last=Belle |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYwQLvIkQ88 |title=Entrevista com David Belle (OSRAM 2006) |trans-title=Interview with David Belle (OSRAM 2006) |year=2006 |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0193723509332582| title = Parkour, Anarcho-Environmentalism, and Poiesis| journal = Journal of Sport &amp; Social Issues| volume = 33| issue = 2| pages = 169–194| year = 2009| last1 = Atkinson | first1 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi.&lt;ref name="CineP20" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''parkour'' derives from ''parcours du combattant'' (obstacle course), the classic obstacle course method of military training proposed by [[Georges Hébert]].&lt;ref name="PAWA-Welcome"&gt;{{cite web |last=Russell |first=Matthew |url=http://www.pawa.fr/Welcome/welcome.html |title=English welcome&amp;nbsp;— Parkour Worldwide Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508021450/http://www.pawa.fr/Welcome/welcome.html |archivedate=8 May 2005 |accessdate=12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=23 February 2006 |url=http://parkour.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=3937 |title=PAWA statement on Freerunning |accessdate=12 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193626/http://parkour.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=3937 |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parkour.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=5481 |title=The name Parkour, simple question |accessdate=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Belle used the term "''les parcours''" to encompass all of his training including climbing, jumping, running, balancing, and the other methods he undertook in his personal athletic advancement.&lt;ref name="Parkour-DB2"&gt;[[#Belle2|Belle]], pp.&amp;nbsp;31–70&lt;/ref&gt; His son, David, further developed his father's methods and achieved success as a stuntman, and one day on a film set showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to [[Hubert Koundé]]. Koundé suggested he change the "c" of "''parcours''" to a "k" because it was stronger and more dynamic, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason, forming "''parkour''".&lt;ref name="CineP37"&gt;[[#Angel|Angel]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

A practitioner of parkour is called a ''traceur'', with the feminine form being ''traceuse''.&lt;ref name="Ferrari" /&gt; They are [[noun substantive|nouns]] derived from the French verb ''[[:fr:wikt:tracer|tracer]]'', which normally means "to trace", as in "tracing a path", in reference to drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/tracer? |title=Portail lexical&amp;nbsp;— Définition de tracer |language=French|accessdate=28 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The verb ''tracer'' used familiarly means: "to hurry up".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:fr:tracer#populaire|(Populaire) Filer, se dépêcher.]] or to run (go) fast (to leave in a hurry) → [[wikt:filer#Verb|(intransitive, informal) to leave, to get going]], [[wikt:dépêcher#Verb|(reflexive) to haste, to hurry up]] → [[wikt:buck up#Interjection|(idiomatic, dated) Hurry up; make haste.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''traceur'' was originally the name of a parkour group headed by David Belle which included [[Sébastien Foucan]] and Stéphane Vigroux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d1AxUPPcF8 |title=An Interview With Stephane Vigroux |publisher=YouTube |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''jam'' refers to a meeting of traceurs, involving training lasting anywhere from hours to several days, often with people from different cities. The first parkour jam was organised in July 2002 by Romain Drouet, with a dozen people including [[Sébastien Foucan]] and Stéphane Vigroux.

== History ==

===Georges Hébert===
In Western Europe, a forerunner of parkour was developed by French naval officer [[Georges Hébert]], who before [[World War I]] promoted athletic skill based on the models of indigenous tribes he had met in Africa.&lt;ref name=HerbertUFF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm |title=Georges Hebert and the Natural Method of Physical Culture |accessdate=2 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050323090031/http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm |archivedate=23 March 2005 |author=Artful Dodger }}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted, "their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, and resistant but yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature."&lt;ref name=HerbertUFF/&gt; His rescue efforts during the 1902 eruption of [[Mount Pelée]] on [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique]], reinforced his belief that athletic skill must be combined with courage and altruism.&lt;ref name=HerbertUFF/&gt; Hébert became a physical education tutor at the college of [[Reims]] in France. Hébert set up a "méthode naturelle" (''natural method'') session consisting of ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, balancing, throwing, lifting, self-defence and swimming. These were intended to develop "the three main forces": energetic (willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness), moral (benevolence, assistance, honour, and honesty) and physical (muscles and breath).&lt;ref name=HebertINSEP&gt;{{cite web |title=Georges Hébert&amp;nbsp;— la methode naturalle |url=http://perso.orange.fr/le.parkour/france/medias/page3.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718150740/http://perso.orange.fr/le.parkour/france/medias/page3.html |archivedate=18 July 2006 |format=JPG |publisher=INSEP&amp;nbsp;— Musée de la Marine |language=French |accessdate=22 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I and World War II, teaching continued to expand, becoming the standard system of French military education and training. Inspired by Hébert, a Swiss architect developed a "''parcours du combattant''"&lt;ref name="No Obstacles"&gt;{{cite web |title=No Obstacles |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_wilkinson?currentPage=all |date=16 April 2007 |first=Alec |last=Wilkinson |work= [[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;—military obstacle course—the first of the courses that are now standard in military training and which led to the development of civilian [[fitness trail]]s and confidence courses.&lt;ref name=HerbertUFF/&gt;

===Raymond and David Belle===
Born in 1939 in [[Vietnam]], Raymond Belle was the son of a French physician and Vietnamese mother. During the [[First Indochina War]], his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in [[Da Lat]] at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order to never be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military [[obstacle course]]s in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the [[Paris Fire Brigade]], a French Army unit.&lt;ref name="CineP20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parkour-DB1"&gt;[[#Belle2|Belle]], p. 23–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raymond Belle Bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parkour.net/modules/articles/item.php?itemid=3 |title=Raymond Belle's biography |date=17 February 2006 |work=Original French biography sourced from 'Allo Dix-Huit', the magazine of the Parisian pompiers. |publisher=Parkour.NET |accessdate=29 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217200929/http://parkour.net/modules/articles/item.php?itemid=3 |archivedate=17 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Belle NewYorker.jpg|thumb|[[David Belle]] is considered the founder of parkour.]]
Raymond's son, [[David Belle]], was born in 1973. He experimented with [[gymnastics]] and [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the [[sports club]]s. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings{{which|date=March 2016}} that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.&lt;ref name="CineP20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parkour-DB2"/&gt;

Through   conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called "''parcours''". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned  that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.&lt;ref name="Parkour-DB2"/&gt;

===Yamakasi===
{{main|Yamakasi}}
David initially trained on his own, and after moving to [[Lisses]], found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together.&lt;ref name="Nacho" /&gt; The group eventually included David Belle, [[Sébastien Foucan]], Châu Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perrière.

====Discipline====
The group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Angel|Angel]], p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing.&lt;ref name="David Belle p.43"&gt;[[#Belle|Belle and Perriére]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot.&lt;ref name="David Belle p.42"/&gt; At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.&lt;ref name="David Belle p.46"&gt;[[#Belle|Belle and Perriére]], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Respecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.&lt;ref name="David Belle p.43"/&gt;

Humility was an important principle.&lt;ref name="David Belle p.46"/&gt; No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.&lt;ref name="David Belle p.43"/&gt;

To join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining.&lt;ref name="David Belle p.42"&gt;[[#Belle|Belle and Perriére]], p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently — "to create the means to be yourself"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Belle|Belle and Perriére]], p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; — and there was a complete trust within the group.&lt;ref name="David Belle p.46"/&gt; Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour.&lt;ref name="David Belle p.47"&gt;[[#Belle|Belle and Perriére]], p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Belle|Belle and Perriére]], p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name and split====
In 1997, David Belle's brother Jean-François invited the group to perform for the public in a firefighter show in Paris.&lt;ref name="CineP35"&gt;[[#Angel|Angel]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; For the performance, the group named themselves ''[[Yamakasi]]'', from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] [[Lingala language|Lingala]] ''ya makási'', meaning strong in one's person, or "strong man, strong spirit". Sébastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: "''l'art du déplacement''{{-"}} (French for "the art of movement").&lt;ref name="CineP35"/&gt; The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-François also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. Sébastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and Sébastien chose to leave the group, and used the name "parkour" to describe their activity (see [[Parkour#Etymology|§ Etymology]] above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term ''l'art du déplacement'' &lt;ref name="CineP20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parkour-DB3"&gt;[[#Belle2|Belle]], pp. 71–79&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Parkour#Derivative terminologies and disciplines|§ Derivative terminologies and disciplines]] below).

==Organizations==

National parkour organizations include the [[World Freerunning and Parkour Federation]], established in 2007, who have worked with [[MTV]] to produce Parkour related shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wfpf.com/history-wfpf/ History of WFPF] wfpf.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Gymnastics Federation]] (FIG) added parkour as one of their disciplines in 2017, receiving lots of opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accessparkour.com/fig-gate-the-story-so-far/|title=Fig-Gate: The Great Parkour Scandal|date=11 May 2017|publisher=accessparkour.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1051013/denmark-add-voice-to-opposition-of-figs-move-into-parkour|title=Denmark add voice to opposition of FIG's move into parkour|publisher=insidethegames.biz|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1053647/parkour-earth-officially-becomes-sports-international-federation-as-fig-row-continues|title=Parkour Earth officially launches as FIG row continues|publisher=insidethegames.biz|date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programme includes Speed-Run (Sprint) and Freestyle.

== Philosophy ==
According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and theories behind parkour are an integral aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because he wants it "to be alive" and "for people to use it".&lt;ref name=GYamakasi&gt;{{cite video |people=Belle, Châu; Belle, Williams; Hnautra, Yann and Daniels, Mark (director) |title=Generation Yamakasi

Academic research on parkour has tended to describe how parkour provides a novel way of interacting with the urban environment that challenges the use and meaning of urban space, metropolitan life, and embodiment.&lt;ref name="new-media-technologies"&gt;{{cite journal |title=New Media Technologies in Lifestyle Sport |author1=Gilchrist, Paul |author2=Wheaton, Belinda |conference=Digital Media Sport: Technology and Power in the Network Society |editor=Hutchins/Rowe |date=30 July 2012 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1821623/New_media_technologies_in_lifestyle_sport |accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer convention of parkour philosophy has been the idea of "human reclamation".&lt;ref name="two-theories"&gt;{{cite web |title=Two Theories on Parkour Philosophy |publisher=Parkour North America |url=http://parkournorthamerica.com/plugins/content/content.php?content.17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712091605/http://parkournorthamerica.com/plugins/content/content.php?content.17 |archivedate=12 July 2012 |date=7 September 2007 |accessdate=16 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Tran of Urban Evolution clarifies it as "a means of reclaiming what it means to be a human being. It teaches us to move using the natural methods that we should have learned from infancy. It teaches us to touch the world and interact with it, instead of being sheltered by it."&lt;ref name="two-theories"/&gt; Another traceur{{who|date=January 2016}} writes, "It is as much as a part of truly learning the physical art as well as being able to master the movements, it gives you the ability to overcome your fears and pains and reapply this to life as you must be able to control your mind in order to master the art of parkour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parkour History |work=Urban discipline |url=http://www.urban-discipline.com/parkourhistory.htm |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
A campaign was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry.&lt;ref name="rivalry-free"&gt;{{cite web |title=Keeping parkour rivalry-free : JOIN IN ! |publisher=Parkour.NET |url=http://parkour.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=9539 |date=1 May 2007 |accessdate=11 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Jumped-up' plan to stage world competition sees free runners falling out |first1=Paul |last1=Bignell |first2=Rob |last2=Sharp |work=The Independent |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2472154.ece |date=22 April 2007 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101230324/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2472154.ece |archivedate=1 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Erwan Le Corre]]: "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or the benefits of a few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore."&lt;ref name="rivalry-free"/&gt; Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1NzOqfW7z4 |title=Ryan Doyle – Parkour Training Jam |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===David Belle===
In his 2009 book "Parkour", David Belle stressed that the most important aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Belle2|Belle]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: "No, I am going to show you how ''I'' do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else."&lt;ref name="David Belle, Parkour, p.59"/&gt;

The philosophy of parkour has been compared to that of martial arts.&lt;ref name="Bruce Lee and the Philosophy of parkour"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bruce Lee and the Philosophy of Parkour | first= Rob | last= Green |publisher= WorldWideJam.tv |url=http://www.worldwidejam.tv/db.bl.jam.parkour.html |accessdate=1 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''The New Yorker'', David Belle acknowledges the influence: "There's a quote by [[Bruce Lee]] that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?".&lt;ref name="No Obstacles" /&gt; In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow I made you do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before."&lt;ref&gt;Cine parkour, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Belle2|Belle]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Belle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, "Precision is all about being measured," and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUeHrPazTtY |title=David Belle – Parkour |publisher=YouTube |date=16 July 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times."&lt;ref name="David Belle, Parkour, p.59"&gt;[[#Belle2|Belle]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.

== Practice ==

=== Movement ===
[[File:Parkour - climb stairs.ogv|thumb|A practitioner climbing a wall]]
While there is no official list of "moves" in parkour, the style in which practitioners move often sets them apart from others,&lt;ref name="Freitas" /&gt; and there are a number of movements considered fundamental.&lt;ref name="pkgen-history" /&gt; Some examples of common movements are:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Murray |first=Joseph B |year=2010 |title=Knowing Obstacles: Urban Dialogues in Parkour Practice |type=Doctoral dissertation |location=Central European University |url=http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2010/murray_joseph.pdf |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mclean"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.injury.2006.04.119| title = Paediatric fractures sustained in Parkour (free running)| journal = Injury| volume = 37| issue = 8| pages = 795–797| year = 2006| last1 = McLean | first1 = C.

=== Equipment ===

Parkour is not widely practiced in dedicated public facilities. Although efforts are being made to create places for it, many traceurs do not like the idea, as it is contradictory to parkour's values of adaptation, creativity, and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414060418/http://www.miramar.usmc.mil/newspage175.htm|title=American Parkour HotSpots Contest |date=21 May 2008 |accessdate=13 June 2008|archivedate=14 April 2009|url=http://www.miramar.usmc.mil/newspage175.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traceurs practice parkour in both rural and urban areas such as gyms, parks, playgrounds, offices, and abandoned structures.

Because parkour philosophy is about learning to control oneself in interaction with the environment, many parkour experts tend to view serious physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said "Thinking you're going to fail at something gives you a higher risk of doing just that. Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beachcombermb.com/opinions/2012/01/27/parkour-legends-daniel-ilabaca-tim-shieff-and-oleg-vorslov/ |title=The Beachcomber : Parkour Legends: Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, and Oleg Vorslov |publisher=Beachcombermb.com |date=17 March 2013 |accessdate=22 May 2014|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807001610/http://www.beachcombermb.com/opinions/2012/01/27/parkour-legends-daniel-ilabaca-tim-shieff-and-oleg-vorslov/ |archivedate=7 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.&lt;ref name="Puddle"&gt;{{Cite journal

American traceur Mark Toorock said injuries are rare "because participants rely not on what they can't control&amp;nbsp;– wheels or the icy surfaces of snowboarding and skiing&amp;nbsp;– but their own hands and feet," but Lanier Johnson, executive director of the [[American Sports Medicine Institute]], noted that many of the injuries are not reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jump First, Ask Questions Later |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/08/AR2008010803471_4.html | date=8 January 2008 |first=Colin |last=Bane |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Initially featured in films of French director/producer [[Luc Besson]], parkour was first introduced to the British public by the BBC One station trailer ''Rush Hour''. It featured David Belle leaping across London's rooftops from his office to home, in an attempt to catch his favourite BBC programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unmissable new campaign for BBC ONE |work=BBC Press Office |date=11 April 2002 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/04_april/11/rush_hour.shtml |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=BBC film's rooftop stunts 'real' |work=BBC News |date=19 April 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1939106.stm |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This advertisement, along with others for [[Coca-Cola]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Toyota]], had a large-scale impact on public awareness of parkour.&lt;ref name="pkgen-history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Urban Free Flow: A Poetics of Parkour |last=Geyh |first=Paula |work=M/C journal |volume=9 |issue=3 |date=July 2006 |url=http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0607/06-geyh.php |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of parkour show-reels and documentaries has always been crucial to the spread of parkour, and is common in the parkour community.&lt;ref name="CineP20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parkour-DB3"/&gt; ''[[Jump London]]'' is a 2003 documentary explaining some of the background of parkour, culminating with [[Sébastien Foucan]], Johann Vigroux, and [[Jérôme Ben Aoues]] demonstrating their parkour skills. ''Jump London'' changed the presence of parkour in the UK almost overnight and is widely credited for inspiring a new generation of traceurs.&lt;ref name="new-media-technologies" /&gt; It was followed by ''[[Jump Britain]]'' in 2005. Both Jump films were shown in over 80 countries exposing the discipline and its philosophy to an unprecedented global audience and are cited by numerous practitioners as their motivation for taking up the discipline.

The Australian version of ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' broadcast a segment about parkour on 16 September 2007, featuring Foucan and Stephane Vigroux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Go Jump|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=295676| authorlink=Liz Hayes|first=Liz|last=Hayes|work=[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]|date=16 September 2007|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkour is not defined by a set of rules or guidelines, which has been particularly attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation.&lt;ref name=Thorpe1&gt;{{cite book|title=International Review for the Sociology of Sport |last=Thorpe |first=Holly |year=2013 |publisher=SAGE Publications Inc |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2010 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the parkour community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Palestinian Parkour |last=Sorcher |first=Sara |work=The New York Times |date=13 October 2010 |type=video |url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/1248069141234/palestinian-parkour.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[BBC]] covered youth parkour participation in [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kashmir freerunning: Finding freedom in the art of parkour |date=7 December 2014 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30347099/ |accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkour has become a popular element in action sequences, with film directors hiring parkour practitioners as [[stunt performer]]s. The first director to do so was [[Luc Besson]], for the film ''[[Taxi 2]]'' in 1998, followed by ''[[Yamakasi (film)|Yamakasi]]'' in 2001 featuring members of the original [[Yamakasi]] group, and its sequel ''[[Les fils du vent]]'' in 2004. Also in 2004, Besson wrote ''[[District 13]]'', another feature film involving advanced parkour chase sequences, starring [[David Belle]] and [[Cyril Raffaelli]],&lt;ref name=LADailyNews/&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesOnline/&gt; followed by the sequel ''[[District 13: Ultimatum]]'' in 2009 and remade in English as ''[[Brick Mansions]]'' in 2014.

Modern video games frequently include aspects of parkour as major game-play elements. The [[Assassin's Creed|''Assassin's Creed'' series]] makes heavy use of parkour movement (called freerunning in the game).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assassin's Creed (Xbox 360) |url=http://www.gamesxtreme.net/x360/game/assassins-creed/review.shtml |date=28 November 2007 |accessdate=11 December 2007 |quote=It's a good start, an excellent free-roaming adventure with some of the best use of parkour yet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Review: 'Assassin's Creed' Not Quite Perfect |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,311973,00.html |first=Ryan |last=Pearson |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |quote=Leave it to the French to bring us the first parkour video game |date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=P. |title=Review of ''Assassin's Creed'' |work=Electronic Gaming Monthly |issue=224 |date=January 2008 |page=89 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;the game features 'a challenging parkour path of escape&amp;nbsp;...'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Mirror's Edge]]'' games are heavily inspired by parkour, consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Mysterious-gift-puts-to-rest-1903-deaths-of-three-608191.php | work=Wired | first=Chris | last=Baker | title=Review: Mirror's Edge, the First-Person Parkour Game You Must Play | date=11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirror's Edge puts grace of parkour at fingertips |url=http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=744129&amp;category=ARTS |first=Doug |last=Elfman |date=28 November 2008 |accessdate=23 September 2009 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Brink (video game)|Brink]]'' introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic [[first person shooter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GDC Europe: Perfecting The SMART Parkour Traversal System In ''Brink'' |date=15 August 2011 |last=Nutt |first=Christian |work=Gamasura |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/126533/GDC_Europe_Perfecting_The_SMART_Parkour_Traversal_System_In_Brink.php |accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' and ''[[Dying Light]]'' include a central parkour mechanic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twinfinite.net/2014/06/13/e3-dying-light-hands-preview/|title=E3 – Dying Light Hands-On Preview|first=Alissa|last=Mcaloon|work=twinfinite.com|date=13 June 2014|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2867562/dying-light-preview-zombies-are-even-more-stomach-churning-in-virtual-reality.html|title=Dying Light preview: Zombies are even more stomach-churning in virtual reality|first=Hayden|last=Dingman|work=PCWorld|date=1 March 2015|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Crackdown]]'' and ''[[Crackdown 2]]'' include an emphasis on gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Reasons to Play Crackdown |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/754/754563p1.html |first=Cam |last=Shea |date=10 January 2007 |accessdate=3 January 2008 |quote=It's part super hero (think Hulk or Neo), part Jumping Flash and part parkour.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tony Hawk's American Wasteland]]'' allows the character to use several freerunning techniques while not on the skateboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tony Hawk's American Wasteland&amp;nbsp;— Xbox 360 |url=http://hexus.net/gaming/reviews/xbox-360/4583-tony-hawks-american-wasteland-xbox-360/ |first=Steven |last=Williamson |date=8 February 2006 |accessdate=10 February 2013 |quote=Later on in story mode, you'll even get the chance to learn some parkour skills!}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tron Evolution]]''{{'}}s basic movements and combat were based on parkour and [[capoeira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|title=Tron Evolution Pre-E3 Hands-On Interview: Alex Peters |first=Darren |last=Hedges |url=http://www.gamespot.com/tron-evolution/videos/tron-evolution-pre-e3-hands-on-interview-alex-peters-6263033/ |date=18 May 2010 |publisher=GameSpot |interviewer=Ricardo Torres |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518191251/http://www.gamespot.com/tron-evolution/videos/tron-evolution-pre-e3-hands-on-interview-alex-peters-6263033/ |archivedate=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military training ===
Although parkour itself grew out of military obstacle-course training,&lt;ref name="CineP20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parkour-DB1"/&gt; it has become a separate discipline. After the attention that parkour received following the 2006 film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', military forces around the world began looking for ways to incorporate elements from parkour into military training. A physical trainer with the Royal Marines trained with parkour practitioners with hopes of introducing some of their techniques to his own students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/12/military.uknews4 |title=Freerunning goes to war as marines take tips from EZ, Livewire and Sticky |work=The Guardian |date= 12 January 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2009 | location=London | first=Robert | last=Booth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado Parkour began a project to introduce elements from parkour into the U.S. military&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coloradoparkour.com/projects.html |title=Projects |publisher=Colorado Parkour |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one [[Miramar, San Diego|San Diego]] staff sergeant trained [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] in parkour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414060418/http://www.miramar.usmc.mil/newspage175.htm |title=Parkour: Getting over the wall |publisher=US Marine Corps |date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=9 August 2009 |archivedate=14 April 2009|url=http://www.miramar.usmc.mil/newspage175.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robotics === 

In October 2018, [[WIRED]] magazine issued a report ("Watch Boston Dynamics' Humanoid Robot Do Parkour")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url           = https://www.wired.com/story/watch-boston-dynamics-humanoid-robot-do-parkour/

| publisher     = [[WIRED]] magazine 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; that included some videos showing a humanoid robot doing parkour. ("See also" the later article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url           = https://www.wired.com/story/how-boston-dynamics-robot-videos-became-internet-gold/ 
| title         = How Boston Dynamics' Robot Videos Became Internet Gold

| publisher     = [[WIRED]] magazine 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;, by the same author, called ''"How Boston Dynamics' Robot Videos Became Internet Gold"''.)

== Derivative terminologies and disciplines ==
In September 2003, Mike Christie's documentary ''[[Jump London]]'', starring [[Sébastien Foucan]], was released. In the documentary, the term "[[freerunning]]" was used as an attempt to translate "parkour", in order to make it more appealing to the English-speaking audience.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardes, Dan (2009) ''The Parkour &amp; Freerunning Handbook''. It Books. {{ISBN|0-06-178367-6}}. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Foucan decided to keep using the term "freerunning" to describe his discipline, to distinguish it from David Belle's methods.&lt;ref name="FreerunningSF"&gt;{{cite book |title=Free Running |last=Foucan |first=Sébastien |authorlink=Sébastien Foucan |year=2008  |isbn=978-1-56975-652-2 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CineP39"&gt;[[#Angel|Angel]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining seven ''Yamakasi'' members continued to use the term "''l'art du déplacement''{{-"}}, also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien's freerunning, ''l'art du déplacement'' was less about the hard discipline from the original ''Yamakasi'' group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term "parkour", saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.&lt;ref name="CineP39"/&gt;

Both parkour and freerunning encompass the ideas of overcoming obstacles and self-expression; in freerunning, the greater emphasis is on self-expression.&lt;ref name="FreerunningSF"/&gt; Although the differences between the disciplines are often hard to discern, practitioners tend to aspire to parkour and describe themselves as traceurs rather than as freerunners.&lt;ref name="Kidder1"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6040.2012.01406.x| title = Parkour, the Affective Appropriation of Urban Space, and the Real/Virtual Dialectic| journal = City &amp; Community| volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = 229–253| year = 2012| last1 = Kidder | first1 = J.

The '''Primavera Rosa''' was an elite women's professional one-day [[road bicycle race]] held between 1999 and 2005 in [[Liguria]], [[Italy]] as part of the [[UCI Women's Road Cycling World Cup]]. The race was a female version of [[Milan–San Remo]] being organised on the same day and finishing in [[Sanremo]] shortly before the men but racing over a shorter distance, hence the start was in [[Varazze]]. The 2006 edition was initially planned but cancelled before the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/editions/first-edition-cycling-news-for-january-26-2006 | title=Women's Milan-San Remo cancelled |date=26 January 2006 |first=Susan |last=Westemeyer |work=cyclingnews.com |accessdate= 12 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yd7tXmEK |archivedate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''C. Bernard Shea Rowing Center''' is the boathouse for the [[Princeton University]] rowing programs.  Located on [[Lake Carnegie]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], the center consists of the Class of 1887 Boathouse and the Richard Ottesen Prentke ‘67 Training Center.  The Shea Center was dedicated on October 7, 2000.

== History ==

Rowing began at Princeton in 1870 with a half-dozen undergraduates and two boats, which the students taught themselves to row on the [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Alexander (1978). ''A Princeton Companion''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1874, the Princeton Boating Club had been formed and had obtained a wood-framed boathouse on the canal.  But by 1884, the canal had become so busy with steam-powered boat traffic that rowing was forced to cease.  Early in the 20th century, former coxswain Howard Russell Butler convinced [[Andrew Carnegie]] to create a lake at Princeton.  When some lakeside property owners demanded to sell their entire farms, Carnegie balked at providing full financing, Butler and a group of eleven other alumni generously stepped in and purchased over a hundred acres of land, 89 of which were then given to the University.  Other alumni gave hundreds of acres of land to the University at the same time.  The lake was finally completed in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Rivinus, Willis (2005). ''Rowing at Princeton''. Princeton University Rowing Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a fine body of water on which to compete, rowing began again in 1911. In 1913, the Class of 1887 Boathouse was donated to the University on the occasion of the 25th reunion of the Class; they had been the last class to row on the Canal.  The {{convert|22000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} structure initially accommodated only 3 full eights of heavyweight oarsmen.

As Princeton added new rowing programs, the building housed heavyweight, lightweight, women’s and lightweight women’s crew programs.  There were a number of piecemeal modifications over the years to accommodate the additional athletes, leaving a building that was maze-like and confusing. By 1997, the boathouse was serving more than 160 athletes on a daily basis, and was packed beyond overflowing.  Additionally, the building was falling into disrepair.  Indeed, a 1996 meeting of the Princeton University Rowing Association (PURA) was punctuated by a window falling out.&lt;ref&gt;Princeton Rowing Notes, winter 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent to this meeting, PURA president Dick Prentke ‘67 initiated the effort to work with University to pursue a full-scale renovation and addition.

PURA turned to architect and former lightweight rower Jeff Peterson ’84 to explore initial concepts for the project.  Peterson's firm at that time, Architectural Resources Cambridge, was eventually hired to design the project. After the project, Peterson started Peterson Architects, a firm that focuses primarily on boathouses.

PURA raised more than $8 million from over 1200 donors for the project, including a $4 million gift by Irene C. Shea in memory of her husband C. Bernard Shea ‘1916.  Mr. Shea had been a student when the 1887 Boathouse opened and was an avid fan of rowing and all things Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/00/1002/8.shtml "Dedication Set For Rowing Center"], ''Princeton Weekly Bulletin'', October 2, 2000. Retrieved on 2010-11-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction commenced in June 1999.  Crews were able to partially occupy the 1887 Boathouse for boat storage in the spring of 2000.  The project was completed in time for full occupancy in the fall of 2000.

An unusually heavy rainfall in April 2007 caused the water level in Lake Carnegie to rise several feet, flooding Shea Rowing Center and suspending activities for several days.&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, Sam. [http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2007/04/17/18112/ "Storm Forces University to Curtail Operations"],''The Daily Princetonian'', April 17, 2007. Retrieved on 2010-11-7.&lt;/ref&gt; After the flood, the University engaged Peterson Architects to repair the facility and to mitigate potential damage from future floods.

== Design ==

The C. Bernard Shea Rowing Center serves as a gateway to the Princeton Campus, the first visible buildings when approaching from the east. The center consists of the original Class of 1887 Boathouse (22,000 s.f.) and the Richard Ottesen Prentke Training Center (13,500 s.f.). To achieve architectural consistency, the newer Prentke Center reiterates the bay spacing, hipped roofs, and tripartite window configurations of the original building. 
The tower of the 1887 Boathouse is the center's entry and focal point. On its second floor, it features a double-height sky-lit space with mahogany flooring, benches and wainscoting. A gallery extending to the west features historical photographs, overlooks the lake and provides access to shower and locker facilities. The gallery arrives at a grand open-timbered club room with lounge seating, trophy cases, and video facilities. 
The Prentke Center includes two bays for small boats, and a moving-water rowing tank. In the tank, the broadly arched window evokes the arches of the Washington Street Bridge. The upper level contains three large workout spaces framed with heavy timber trusses. These rooms are finished with mahogany wainscot and athletic rubber flooring.&lt;ref&gt;Rivinus, Willis (2005). ''Rowing at Princeton''. Princeton University Rowing Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

The Shea Rowing Center has won a number of architectural design awards, including a 2005 Boston Society of Architects Honor Award for Design&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture Boston'', Jan/Feb 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2001 Facility of Merit Award from Athletic Business Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;''Athletic Business'', December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also recognized by Boathouse Finder as a building of outstanding “Architectural Achievement.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhfinder.com/boathouses/Page-8/ "Architectural Achievement Boathouses,"] Boathouse Finder. Retrieved on 11/15/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Don''' is a song written and recorded by Australian country singer [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]]. The song is a tribute to Australian cricketer, [[Donald Bradman]] and $1 from each sale went towards the [[Bradman Museum]]. The song was released in June 1996 as the lead single from Williamson's thirteenth studio album ''[[Pipe Dream (John Williamson album)|Pipe Dream]]'' and peaked at number 72 on the [[ARIA Charts]].

Following Bradman's death in February 2001, Williamson performed the track at Bradman's Memorial Service at [[St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnwilliamson.com.au/photos/attachment/bradman_tb2/|title=2001 John performs his tribute at Sir Donald Bradman’s Memorial Service. |publisher=John Williamson|date=5 May 2014|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/aug/15/our-don-review-adelaide-natalie-williams|title= Our Don review Donald Bradman's symphonic tribute hits for six|publisher=The Guardian|date= 15 August 2014|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2001/death_of_don_bradman/1241178.stm|title=Greats attend Bradman tribute|date=25 March 2001|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original scraps of paper this song was written on have been framed and hang in the Bradman Museum at [[Bowral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianjazzagency.com.au/artist/78-artist-showcase/180-john-williamson.html|title=John Williamson |publisher=Australian Jazz Agency|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2006, [[Rupert Lowe]] resigned as Chairman of Southampton Leisure Holdings, along with other directors Andrew Cowen, Guy Askham, Mike Richards and David Windsor-Clive.

On 26 February 2007, [[Michael Wilde]] offered his resignation as a Director effective from 28 February 2007 as a result of his failure to bring in new investment. The resignation was accepted by the board as being in the best interests of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/?page_id=8222 SAINTSFC.CO.UK: / News / Archive / Club Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2007, it was rumoured that [[Paul Allen]], the [[United States|American]] entrepreneur who formed [[Microsoft]] with [[Bill Gates]], may launch a takeover bid for [[Southampton F.C.|the club]]. An apparent close source said "he believes there is long term investment value in UK [[Soccer]]. Southampton is a sleeping giant, a family-supported club with traditional values, and we see the value in taking the brand global."&lt;ref name="Saints confirm takeover bid received"&gt;{{cite news| title = Saints confirm takeover bid received| url = http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/display.var.1359684.0.saints_confirm_takeover_bid_received.php| publisher = Daily Echo| date = 27 April 2007| accessdate = 27 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration ==
Shares in the Company were suspended from trading on 1 April 2009, when the Company announced that it was in negotiations to secure additional financing to ensure that it was able to continue trading.

Administrators Mark Fry and David Hudson, partners of [[Begbies Traynor]], took over control of the parent company and all assets until a new owner could be found. &lt;ref name="Southampton Fc in Admistration"&gt;{{cite news| title = Southampton FC owner falls into administration| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/football_league/article6018444.ece| publisher = The Times| accessdate = 24 October 2009 | location=London | date=2 April 2009 | first1=Catherine | last1=Boyle | first2=Helen | last2=Power | first3=Gary | last3=Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Mark Fry and David Hudson of Begbies Traynor appointed as joint administrators to Southampton Leisure Holdings plc| url =http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/articles/article.php?page_id=11581 | publisher = [[Southampton F.C.]] | date = 2 April 2009| accessdate = 2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7583">A '''system quarterback''' is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] who flourishes under a particular offensive [[play calling system|system]], specifically one that focuses on [[forward pass|passing]].  The term is often seen as a pejorative, for it implicitly downplays a quarterback's talent or skill by implying that a successful offense is due to a particular scheme or that a quarterback is successful due to his employment under specific circumstances. A system quarterback is usually perceived as having their statistics inflated by a particular strategy. Offensive schemes that tend to feature so-called system quarterbacks are the "[[Run &amp; Shoot|run and shoot]]", [[spread offense|spread]], and, less frequently, [[option offense|spread option]] offenses.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&amp;id=3145177 Heisman candidates could make history -- and change minds], ESPN, December 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dallas"&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/football/nfl/gosselin/position/stories/041005dnspodraftseriesqb.a981c.html Quarterback: 'System' label a burden come draft time], ''Dallas Morning News'', April 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origin==
Russ Lande of ''[[Sporting News]]'' traced the term's etymology, or at least currency, to the early 1990s, when two University of Houston quarterbacks failed to carry college success into their professional careers.&lt;ref name="tsn"/&gt; First, [[Andre Ware]], in head coach [[Jack Pardee]] and offensive coordinator [[John Jenkins (American football coach)|John Jenkins]]'s run and shoot offense, had a record-setting 1989 season that culminated in a [[Heisman Trophy]]. He was the seventh overall pick in the [[1990 NFL Draft]], but did not have success in either the [[National Football League]] or the [[Canadian Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/heisman/flops.html The List: Biggest Heisman Flops], ESPN, retrieved February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Klingler]] took over for Ware at UH and was the sixth overall pick in the [[1992 NFL Draft]]. He too, failed to find exceptional success in the NFL.&lt;ref name="tsn"/&gt;

==Usage==
Recently, the appellation was commonly applied to [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]] quarterbacks that operated under former head coach [[Mike Leach (American football coach)|Mike Leach]] and offensive coordinator [[Dana Holgorsen]]'s [[spread offense]]. In the 2000s, the school had several different quarterbacks that threw in excess of 4,000 yards in a season. According to some pundits, this demonstrated that the quarterback had simply been an interchangeable part in a prolific passing offense. Some Texas Tech quarterbacks, with their college tenure in parentheses, described as such include:
*[[Sonny Cumbie]] (2001–2004), threw for 4,742&amp;nbsp;yards his senior year.&lt;ref name="dallas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dallas 1-23-09"&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/texastech/stories/012309dnsposeniorlede.3af0bf5.html Quarterbacks Harrell, Bomar are battling perception], ''Dallas Morning News'', January 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=118210 Sonny Cumbie Stats], ESPN, retrieved February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Graham Harrell]] (2004–2008), threw for 4,555, 5,705, and 5,111&amp;nbsp;yards his last three years.&lt;ref name="dallas 1-23-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/bucky_brooks/02/10/qbs/ '09 NFL draft: Top 10 QB prospects], ''Sports Illustrated'', February 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160425 Graham Harrell Stats], ESPN, retrieved February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Kliff Kingsbury]] (1998–2002), passed for 4,642&amp;nbsp;yards his senior year.&lt;ref name="dallas 1-23-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pro"&gt;[http://www.profootballweekly.com/PFW/NFLDraft/Draft+Extras/2008/harrell070408.htm Shaking the 'system' label] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011221650/http://www.profootballweekly.com/PFW/NFLDraft/Draft+Extras/2008/harrell070408.htm |date=2008-10-11 }}, ''Pro Football Weekly'', July 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/kingsbury_kliff00.html Player Bio: Kliff Kingsbury], Texas Tech University, retrieved February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symons]] (2000–2003), threw for 5,336&amp;nbsp;yards his senior year.&lt;ref name="dallas 1-23-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2003-2004/teamcume.html Cumulative Season Statistics], Texas Tech University, 2003, retrieved February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The label is not restricted to Texas Tech, however, and pundits and coaches have referred to players from several other schools as benefiting from systems. In 2007, then Hawaii head coach and offensive coordinator [[June Jones]] infamously defended his own alleged system quarterback, Colt Brennan, by making the counter-accusation against Tim Tebow of Florida.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt; Players from schools other than Texas Tech that were described as system quarterbacks include:
*[[Colt Brennan]] – [[Hawaii Warriors football|Hawaii]] (2005–2007), under June Jones's [[Run &amp; Shoot|run and shoot offense]].&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;
*[[Timmy Chang]] – Hawaii (2000–2004), under June Jones's run and shoot.&lt;ref name="dallas"/&gt;
*[[Chase Daniel]] – [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]] (2005–2008), under [[Dave Christensen]]'s spread offense.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;

The '''"Giuseppe Dal Ben" Ski Jump Arena''' (''Trampolino "Giuseppe Dal Ben"'') is a [[ski jumping]] venue in [[Predazzo]], [[Val di Fiemme]], [[Trentino]], in northern [[Italy]]. It is a venue in the [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] [[Ski jumping World Cup]].

==History==
Opened in 1989, the venue hosted the [[ski jumping]] and [[nordic combined]] events of three editions of [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]] ([[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1991|1991]], [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2003|2003]], [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2013|2013]]), of [[2013 Winter Universiade]], as well as many events of the [[Ski jumping World Cup]].

==Venue==
The {{convert|3000|m|ft}} area consists of two main [[ski jumping hill]]s (HS 134 and HS 106), other training hills (K35 and K62) and facilities for athletes, judges, federations, journalists, media, and spectators. The hills are covered with ceramic material and landing areas are covered with plastic material, guaranteeing the functionality throughout the year also in summer. The lighting system also allows competitions events by night.

The main building hosts also the Organising Committee of the cross-country ski event "[[Marcialonga]]", that every January passes through the arena.

The nearby [[gondola lift]] complex runs to the slopes of [[Ski Center Latemar]] in winter, and in summer to the alpine trails on the mountain [[Latemar]], part of the UNESCO world heritage site of [[Dolomites]].
