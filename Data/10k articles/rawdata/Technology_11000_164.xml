'''Adaptive clothing''' is clothing designed for people with physical disabilities, the elderly, and the infirm who may experience difficulty dressing themselves due to an inability to manipulate closures, such as buttons and zippers, or due to a lack of a full range of motion required for self-[[Clothing|dressing]]. Adaptive clothing typically offers rear-closure designs so that an individual can be dressed more easily by a carer. For example, rather than buttons and zippers, [[Velcro]] may be used for garment closures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Disabled World  | title = Adaptive Clothing&amp;nbsp;– Information and Availability | url=http://www.disabled-world.com/assistivedevices/adaptive-clothing.php | date = 20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common misconception of adaptive clothing is that it is only for wheelchair users or others that suffer from severe disabilities. Whilst these groups do benefit from the garments, adaptive clothing is for anyone that can be limited by traditional clothing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbobaby.com/what-is-adaptive-clothing|title=What is Adaptive Clothing?|publisher=CBO Baby|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clothing for special needs ==
Adaptive clothing is specialised clothing that is modified to enable easier dressing for people with a disability. The clothing is modified to help people with a high degree of disability and their carers or to assist individuals with a lower degree of disability to dress independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Errine Adaptive Clothing |title=What is Adaptive Clothing - |url=http://www.errine.com.au/disabled-clothing/what-is-adaptive-clothing.html |accessdate=1 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722231733/http://www.errine.com.au/disabled-clothing/what-is-adaptive-clothing.html |archivedate=22 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptive clothing can benefit people of all ages with disorders or natural ageing such as the following:

* [[Arthritis]]
* [[Cerebral Palsy]]
* [[Multiple Sclerosis]] (MS)
* [[Motor Neurone Disease]] (MND)
* [[Oedema]]
* [[wiktionary:incontinence|Incontinence]]
* [[Alzheimer's Disease]]
* [[Parkinson's Disease]]
* [[Stroke]]
* [[Spinal Cord Injury]] (SCI)
* [[Brain Injury]]
* [[Muscular Dystrophy]] (MD)
* [[Contractures]]

Adaptive clothing typically incorporates flat seams to reduce friction, and discreet adaptations to make the clothing look as consistent with fashion norms as possible, including: easy access snaps, Velcro, stretchy fabric, roomy design to accommodate incontinence aids, longer rise in the back to accommodate sitting in wheelchairs, and elastic waist for increased comfort and easier dressing.

=== Examples ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Special Need !! Associated Problem !! Adaptive Clothing Solution
|-
| Alzheimer's Disease || Individual disrobes at inappropriate times. || [[Locking clothing|Locking Clothing]]
|-
| Oedema || Swelling of feet and legs leads to difficulty wearing conventional footwear or pants.|| Adaptive Shoes and pants are adjustable in size and offer non-restrictive closures.
|-
| Incontinence || Reduced bladder control and urgency || Clothing that can be removed easily and quickly and can accommodate incontinence aids discreetly and comfortably.
|-
| Parkinson's Disease and Arthritis|| Loss of [[fine motor skills]] || Buttons and zippers are replaced with easy touch Velcro or magnetic closures.
|-
|Contractures, Arthritis, MS, MDS, SCI, MD, Paraplegia, Quadriplegia||Inability to bend muscles or move joints||Open back clothing which allows the clothing to be put on frontwards, eliminating the need to bend or rotate muscles or joints.
|}

=== Magnetic Closures ===
For individuals suffering from Parkinson's and other disabilities that affect motor skills, magnetic closures have emerged as a great solution across multiple garments. The original technology was developed by [[MagnaReady]] and was patented in December of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Article of Clothing Having Magnetic Fastening Assemblies|date=2012-11-12|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140130233A1/en|accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology was licensed for numerous lines of adaptive clothing by brands including [[Van Heusen (brand)|Van Heusen]] and [[MagnaClick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eprretailnews.com/2016/09/28/van-heusen-launches-mens-dress-shirt-designed-with-adaptive-technology-that-eliminates-traditional-buttons-3456456483/|title=Van Heusen launches men’s dress shirt designed with adaptive technology that eliminates traditional buttons|work=EPR Retail News|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/business/20161127_Making_a_new_connection_to_certain_dress-shirt_buyers.html|title=Making a new connection to certain dress-shirt buyers|work=Philly.com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic closures again came to the forefront of adaptive clothing when [[Tommy Hilfiger (company)|Tommy Hilfiger]] featured magnetic closures prominently in the launch of their adaptive clothing line in the Spring of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mashable.com/2018/04/06/tommy-hilfiger-tommy-adaptive-disibility-friendly-clothing/#36IilkYVpkqn|title=Tommy Hilfiger unveils innovative clothing line for people with disabilities|last=Gallucci|first=Nicole|work=Mashable|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silvert's Adaptive Clothing &amp; Footwear]] also carry magnetic closure dress shirts for both men and women.&lt;ref name=physically_challenged_ms&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henriques|first1=Carolina|title=Workplace Dress Codes Can Limit Opportunities for People with Disabilities, Researchers Say|url=https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2018/06/08/workplace-dress-codes-can-be-barrier-to-people-with-disabilities-linked-to-ms-other-conditions/|accessdate=June 14, 2018|work=Multiple Sclerosis News Today|date=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfaskop''' was a brand, developed in Sweden by [[Standard Radio &amp; Telefon AB]] (SRT) and applied to [[data terminal]]s and later [[IBM-compatible]] [[Personal Computer|PC]]s.  The term was also used to name Alfaskop AB, a listed Swedish IT services company.,&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SRT, owned by the [[ITT Corporation]] during the 1960s, specialised in Air Traffic Control systems and military radar systems. In 1971, SRT provided the core technology for [[Stansaab]] AS, a joint venture with Saab and the state-owned Swedish Development Company.  The company’s primary focus was systems for real-time data applied to commercial and aviation applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Flightglobal archive 1972
|accessdate=2008-10-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To this was added the data terminal operations of [[Facit]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=wiklund&gt;{{cite web

|title=A history of the Alfaskop terminal

|language=Swedish
|accessdate=2008-10-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Alfaskop terminals quickly gained a foothold in the market for airline reservations with 1,000 in use at [[Scandinavian Airlines]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Flightglobal archive 1975
|accessdate=2008-10-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Stansaab was merged with the Data Saab division of Saab to form [[Datasaab]].&lt;ref name=veterans&gt;{{cite web

|title=Short history of SRT, Stansaab and Datasaab
|language=Swedish
|accessdate=2008-10-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1981, [[Ericsson]], believing that growth in telecoms would be lower than that in [[Information technology|IT]], purchased Datasaab and integrated it with two of its own divisions to form Ericsson Information Systems (EIS).&lt;ref name=baraldi&gt;{{cite web

|author=Enrico Baraldi
|publisher=Department of Business Studies, Uppsala University
|accessdate=2008-10-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accurately predicting convergence between telephony and data technologies, EIS instructed the Alfaskop group to begin working on a design for Ericsson's first PC – the EPC, which was released 16 months later in 1984.&lt;ref name=wiklund /&gt;

Following market difficulties in the United States, particularly with a disappointing launch of its PC, Ericsson decided to abandon its "[[paperless office]]" strategy.&lt;ref name=baraldi /&gt;  In 1988, the division was sold to Nokia and later to ICL in 1990.&lt;ref name=wiklund /&gt;  The final act was its sale by ICL to [[Wyse Technology]] who eventually wound down manufacturing.

==The Alfaskop range==
Due to its work for the aviation industry, one of SRT’s core competencies was the display of [[radar]] images.  It was this expertise that led to the development of the Alfaskop terminal, which was inspired by the launch of [[IBM]]'s range of display terminals.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-10-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These terminals made interaction with computers much easier than with earlier [[punched card]] or [[paper tape]] interfaces.  The [[alphanumeric]], 80 character, 24 line terminal quickly became a standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Alfaskop terminals were designed to be [[pin compatible]] with the IBM equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Alfaskop 3100, the first model, was designed to compete with the [[IBM 2260]], while the later 3500 was developed in response to the [[IBM 3270]].  There followed a refreshed 3500 called System 37 followed by a System 41 – a new design.&lt;ref name=wiklund /&gt;

The first Ericsson PC - the EPC, was released at the [[CeBit]] fair in [[Hanover]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=My time in the Swedish Data Industry
|author=Jörgen Sjöström
|language=Swedish
|accessdate=2008-10-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ericsson Portable PC]] followed a year later.  In subsequent years, with the growth in demand for IBM-compatible PCs, several Alfaskop PC models were released.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

While Ericsson had tried to build its own brand in the PC business, Nokia was willing to trade on the Alfaskop name.  By 1989, they were showing the “Alfaskop Workgroup System” comprising [[80386]]-based [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[80286]]-based [[Desktop computer|desktops]] and [[ethernet]] or [[token ring]] networking.  Office software included the [[X400]]-compatible Alfaskop Mail, [[WordPerfect]] and [[Lotus Freelance]].  The systems were offered with either [[MS-DOS]] or [[OS/2]].

==Commercial Success==
The Alfaskop terminals enjoyed considerable success, even outselling IBM in some markets, particularly in Sweden.  By the early 1980s the company had accumulated profits of about one billion [[Swedish krona|kronor]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  Customers included airlines, newspapers, police, councils and telecommunications companies.&lt;ref name="wiklund" /&gt;

A key benefit of the terminals was that they were IBM compatible but cost less. This meant discounts for volume customers made the terminals attractive. Reflecting the profit contribution made by Alfaskop (other product ranges at Stansaab/Datasaab were losing money), Ericsson invested 40 million kronor in the manufacturing facility at Järfalla outside [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name=baraldi /&gt;  Ericsson had predicted that their Eritex workstation comprising a telex and data terminal would take over from Alfaskop but demand continued with 100,000 units sold by 1983 with annual sales climbing above 25,000.&lt;ref name="wiklund" /&gt;  Eritex was retired by the mid-1980s. Deliveries of Alfaskop continued through the Nokia years and by the time production ceased, more than 900 000 units had been shipped.&lt;ref name="baraldi" /&gt;

==Alfaskop AB==
From 1990, Nokia Data encouraged the development of several franchise partners to drive sales of PCs and [[computer network|network]] technologies.  From 1994 these companies were co-operating closely and delivering network technologies, [[Microsoft]] solutions, and [[systems integration]].  In 1995, these companies were merged to form Alfaskop AB.
In 1997, the company was listed on the Stockholm [[Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=solving&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-10-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000, Alfaskop had 660 employees with 18 offices in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by 2001, the company was bankrupt and its remaining 400 employees were laid off.&lt;ref name=bankrupt /&gt;  Business Wire reported that about half of the employees found employment at Meteorit AB, another IT consultancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12598">The '''applied element method''' ('''AEM''') is a numerical analysis used in predicting the [[Linear continuum|continuum]] and [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] behavior of structures.  The modeling method in AEM adopts the concept of discrete cracking allowing it to automatically track [[Structural failure|structural collapse]] behavior passing through all stages of loading: elastic, [[Crack propagation|crack initiation and propagation]] in tension-weak materials, reinforcement [[Yield (engineering)|yield]], element separation, element contact and [[collision]], as well as collision with the ground and adjacent structures.

==History==
Exploration of the approach employed in the applied element method began in 1995 at the [[University of Tokyo]] as part of Dr.Hatem Tagel-Din's research studies. The term "applied element method" itself, however, was first coined in 2000 in a paper called "Applied element method for structural analysis: Theory and application for linear materials".&lt;ref name=AEMTheory&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |authorlink= |last1=Meguro |first1=K. |last2=Tagel-Din |first2=H. |title=Applied element method for structural analysis: Theory and application for linear materials |journal=Structural engineering/earthquake engineering. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=21–35 |publisher=Japan Society of Civil Engineers(JSCE) |location=Japan |year=2000 |url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200014/000020001400A0511912.php |doi= |id=F0028A |accessdate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229032846/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200014/000020001400A0511912.php |archivedate=2012-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then AEM has been the subject of research by a number of [[academic institution]]s and the driving factor in real-world applications.

==Technical discussion==
In AEM, the structure is divided virtually and modeled as an assemblage of relatively small elements.  The elements are then connected through a set of normal and shear springs located at contact points distributed along the element faces. Normal and shear springs are responsible for the transfer of [[Normal stress|normal]] and [[Shear stress|shear]] stresses from one element to the next.

===Element generation and formulation===
The modeling of objects in AEM is very similar to modeling objects in [[Finite element method|FEM]]. Each object is divided into a series of elements connected and forming a mesh.  The main difference between AEM and FEM, however, is how the elements are joined together.  In AEM the elements are connected by a series of [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] springs representing the material behavior.

There are three types of springs used in AEM:
*'''Matrix Springs''':  Matrix springs connect two elements together representing the main [[material properties]] of the object.
*'''Reinforcing Bar Springs''':  Reinforcement springs are used to implicitly represent additional reinforcement bars running through the object without adding additional elements to the analysis.
*'''Contact Springs''':  Contact Springs are generated when two elements collide with each other or the ground.  When this occurs three springs are generated (Shear Y, Shear X and Normal).

===Automatic element separation===
When the average strain value at the element face reaches the separation strain, all springs at this face are removed and elements are no longer connected until a collision occurs, at which point they collide together as rigid bodies.

Separation strain represents the strain at which adjacent elements are totally separated at the connecting face. This parameter is not available in the elastic material model. For concrete, all springs between the adjacent faces including reinforcement bar springs are cut. If the elements meet again, they will behave as two different rigid bodies that have now contacted each other. For steel, the bars are cut if the stress point reaches [[Ultimate tensile stress|ultimate stress]] or if the concrete reaches the [[Deformation (mechanics)|separation strain]].

===Automatic element contact/collision===
Contact or collision is detected without any user intervention. Elements are able to separate, contract and/or make contact with other elements. In AEM three contact methods include Corner-to-Face, Edge-to-Edge, and Corner-to-Ground.

==Stiffness matrix==
The spring stiffness in a 2D model can be calculated from the following equations:

: &lt;math&gt;K_n=\frac{E\cdot T\cdot d}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;K_s=\frac{G\cdot T\cdot d}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''d'' is the distance between springs, ''T'' is the thickness of the element, ''a'' is the length of the representative area, ''E'' is the [[Young's modulus]], and ''G'' is the [[shear modulus]] of the material. The above equation's indicate that each spring represents the stiffness of an area (''T''·''d'') within the length of the studied material.

To model reinforcement bars embedded in concrete, a spring is placed inside the element at the location of the bar; the area (''T''·''d'') is replaced by the actual cross section area of the reinforcement bar. Similar to modeling embedded [[steel sections]], the area (''T''·''d'') may be replaced by the area of the steel section represented by the spring.

Although the element motion moves as a [[rigid body]], its internal [[Deformation (engineering)|deformations]] are represented by the spring deformation around each element. This means the element shape does not change during analysis, but the behavior of assembly of elements is deformable.
The two elements are assumed to be connected by only one pair of normal and shear springs. To have a general stiffness matrix, the locations of element and contact springs are assumed in a general position. The stiffness matrix components corresponding to each [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] are determined by assuming a unit [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] in the studied direction and by determining forces at the [[centroid]] of each element. The 2D element stiffness matrix size is 6 × 6; the components of the upper left quarter of the [[stiffness matrix]] are shown below:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
  \sin^2 (\theta+\alpha)K_n &amp; -K_n \sin(\theta+\alpha)\cos(\theta+\alpha) &amp;  \cos(\theta+\alpha)K_s L\sin(\alpha) \\
  +\cos^2(\theta+\alpha)K_s &amp;  +K_s\sin(\theta+\alpha)\cos(\theta+\alpha) &amp; -\sin(\theta+\alpha)K_n L\cos(\alpha) \\
  \\
  -K_n\sin(\theta+\alpha)\cos(\theta+\alpha) &amp; \sin^2(\theta+\alpha)K_s &amp;  \cos(\theta+\alpha)K_n L\cos(\alpha) \\
  +K_s\sin(\theta+\alpha)\cos(\theta+\alpha) &amp; +\cos^2(\theta+\alpha)K_n &amp;  +\sin(\theta+\alpha)K_s L\sin(\alpha) \\
  \\
  \cos(\theta+\alpha)K_s L\sin(\alpha) &amp;  \cos(\theta+\alpha)K_n L\cos(\alpha) &amp; L^2\cos^2(\alpha)K_n \\
  -\sin(\theta+\alpha)K_n L\cos(\alpha) &amp;  +\sin(\theta+\alpha)K_s L\sin(\alpha) &amp; +L^2\sin^2(\alpha)K_s
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The stiffness matrix depends on the contact spring stiffness and the spring location. The stiffness matrix is for only one pair of contact springs. However, the global stiffness matrix is determined by summing up the stiffness matrices of individual pairs of springs around each element. Consequently, the developed stiffness matrix has total effects from all pairs of springs, according to the stress situation around the element. This technique can be used in both [[Structural load|load]] and displacement control cases. The 3D stiffness matrix may be deduced similarly.

==Applications==
The applied element method is currently being used in the following applications:
*Structural vulnerability assessment
**[[Progressive collapse]]
**Blast analysis
**Impact analysis
**[[Seismic analysis]]
*[[Forensic engineering]]
*Performance based design
*Demolition analysis
*Glass performance analysis

[[File:Band-brake (for bicycle rear wheel)b.jpg|thumb|Band brake for rear wheel of a bicycle.]]
A '''band brake''' is a primary or secondary [[brake]], consisting of a band of friction material that tightens concentrically around a cylindrical piece of equipment to either prevent it from rotating (a static or "holding" brake), or to slow it (a [[dynamic brake]]). This application is common on [[winch]] drums and [[chain saw]]s and is also used for some [[bicycle brake]]s.

A former application was the locking of gear rings in [[epicyclic gearing]]. In modern automatic transmissions this task has been taken over entirely by [[Clutch#Multiple plate clutch|multiple-plate clutches]] or multiple-plate brakes.{{citation needed|date=February 2014|reason="Entirely" is a strong word.}}

== Features ==

Band brakes can be simple, compact, rugged, and can generate high force with a light input force.  However, band brakes are prone to grabbing or chatter and loss of brake force when hot.  These problems are inherent with the design and thus limit where band brakes are a good solution.

== Effectiveness ==

One way to describe the effectiveness of the brake is as &lt;math&gt;e^{\mu \theta}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coefficient of friction]] between band and drum, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of wrap.  With a large &lt;math&gt;\mu \theta&lt;/math&gt;, the brake is very effective and requires low input force to achieve high brake force, but is also very sensitive to changes in &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, light rust on the drum may cause the brake to "grab" or chatter, water may cause the brake to slip, and rising temperatures in braking may cause the coefficient of friction to drop slightly but in turn cause brake force to drop greatly.  Using a band material with low &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; increases the input force required to achieve a given brake force, but some low-&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; materials also have more consistent &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; across the range of working temperatures.

== Collaboration with Andy Warhol Foundation ==

Beginning in 2007, Bond No. 9 began a licensing partnership with the Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, allowing for the creation of fragrances bearing the [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]] name, with bottle designs inspired by his works of art.

The fragrances included: ''Andy Warhol Silver Factory'' (2007), ''Andy Warhol Union Square'' (2008), ''Andy Warhol Lexington Avenue'' (2008), ''Andy Warhol Success is a Job in New York'' (2009), ''Andy Warhol Montauk'' (2010), and ''Andy Warhol by Bond No. 9'' (2011).&lt;ref name = "Bond no. 9 :: Perfume Houses" /&gt;

When the licensing agreement came to a close in 2013, Bond No. 9 kept the scents, but renamed and repackaged them.

== The [[I Love New York|I LOVE NY]] Collection ==

In 2011, Bond No. 9 launched a smaller capsule collection celebrating the entire [[State of New York]], called the I LOVE NY by Bond No. 9 collection. The perfume bottles bear the "[[I Love New York|I Love NY]]" logo designed by [[Milton Glaser]].

As of December 2013, the line consists of 8 fragrances: I LOVE NY for ''Him'', ''Her'', ''All'', ''Mothers'', ''Earth Day'', ''Fathers'', ''Marriage Equality'' and ''Holidays''.

A percentage of sales from this collection, is given back to the [[State of New York]] for funding of statewide programs, including recycling and park restoration.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Community activities ==

Bond No. 9 run an ongoing recycling program encouraging customers to bring empty bottles of any brand to their counter for refurbishing or recycling, often offering a gift in return.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''C mount''' is a type of lens mount commonly found on [[16 mm film|16 mm]] [[movie camera]]s, [[closed-circuit television camera]]s, [[machine vision]] cameras and [[microscope]] phototubes.

C-mount lenses provide a male thread, which mates with a female thread on the camera. The thread is nominally {{Convert|1.000|in|mm}} in diameter, with 32 threads per inch, designated as "1-32 UN 2A" in the [[ANSI]] B1.1 standard for unified screw threads. The [[flange focal distance]] is {{Convert|17.526|mm|in}} for a C mount.

Merely to say that a lens is "C-mount" says very little about the lens' intended use. C-mount lenses have been made for many different formats. C-mount lenses are built for the [[8 mm film|8 mm]] and [[16 mm film]] formats and the 1/3", 1/2", 2/3", 1", and 4/3" video formats, which corresponds to a range of image circles approximately from 5 to 22&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.

Depending on the format, the design of the lens and its performance will differ considerably. For example, for the 4/3 format, a 12&amp;nbsp;mm lens is a wide-angle lens and will have a retrofocus design. For the 2/3-inch format, a 12&amp;nbsp;mm lens is "normal" and can have a simple and fast double Gauss layout. For the 1/3-inch format, a 12&amp;nbsp;mm lens is long and can have a telephoto design.

Some TV lenses lack provision to focus or vary the aperture, so may not operate properly with film cameras. Also, some TV lenses may have bits that protrude behind the mount far enough to interfere with the shutter or reflex finder mechanisms of a film camera.

Although C-mount lenses have a back focal distance far too short to be used with 35&amp;nbsp;mm film SLRs or any existing digital SLR, they can be mounted on interchangeable-lens mirrorless digital cameras. One such system is the [[Micro Four Thirds system|Micro Four Thirds]], being used by Olympus and Panasonic. However, the vast majority of C-mount lenses produce an image circle too small to effectively cover the entire (micro-)four-thirds sensor, which has approximately 22&amp;nbsp;mm diagonal. This produces what is popularly called [[vignetting]] but is better described as a mismatch between camera format and lens format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawrenceripsher.com/blog/2009/12/switar-26mm-f1-1-f1-1-review.html Lawrenceripsher.com: Switar 26mm f/1.1 Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215044518/http://lawrenceripsher.com/blog/2009/12/switar-26mm-f1-1-f1-1-review.html |date=December 15, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nikon 1 series]] and the [[Pentax Q series]] can use C-mount lenses without vignetting.

C mount was created by Bell &amp; Howell for their Filmo 70 cine cameras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/CineCamera/conversations/messages/450] Yahoo Group discussion: Cine Camera Collectors&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest Filmos had a slightly different mounts, known as A mount, and B mount.  C mount was found on Filmo 70 cameras with serial numbers 54090 and higher,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcnygenealogy.com/book/kodak/kodak-movie-news-v02-n3.pdf] Kodak Movie News, Vol. 2, No. 3 (May–June 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; probably from about 1926.  Soon after, other camera manufacturers adopted the same mount, and it became a de facto standard for 16&amp;nbsp;mm cine cameras.

CS-mount lenses are built for the smaller formats, 1/2&amp;nbsp;inch and down.

'''''Cadran solaire''''' is an outdoor 1967 steel and aluminum [[sundial]] sculpture by Dutch artist Herman J. van der Heide, installed outside [[Montreal]]'s [[Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium]], in [[Quebec]], Canada. The sculpture was previously installed outside the [[Montreal Planetarium]], in [[Chaboillez Square]], but was relocated in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artpublic.ville.montreal.qc.ca/en/oeuvre/cadran-solaire/|title=Cadran solaire|website=Bureau d'Art Public – Ville de Montréal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espacepourlavie.ca/en/van-der-heide-sundial|title=The van der Heide sundial|website=Space for life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carels Frères''', or Carels Brothers, was a manufacturer of [[stationary steam engine]]s in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. For instance, in 1909, they supplied a 1200&amp;nbsp;hp tandem compound engine with [[super heater]] to  [[List of mills owned by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation Limited#Other Mills that were owned before 1951|Moston Mill]], a [[cotton mill]] in [[Moston, Greater Manchester|Moston]], North Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1989|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was their works no 875, with cylinders {{convert|30|and|53|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} bore with a {{convert|3|ft|11+1/4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} stroke. Developing {{convert|1,200|hp|abbr=on}} at 90 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], [[superheated steam]] {{convert|200|psi|kPa|0|abbr=on}} was supplied by Tetlow boilers. The flywheel, {{convert|19|ft|mm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, was provided with the sixty rope grooves that the full power would have required. The second half of the mill, however, was never completed, and in 1958 electric drives were installed, and the engine was scrapped. 

George Watkins commented that this was typical of continent design. Six or more of Carels' engines were installed in Lancashire mills in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[Pleasure craft|fishing boats]] often have integral corves. These are built into the boat and the water in them kept fresh and [[Water aeration|oxygenated]] through a circulatory system with water and air pumps. This kind of corf is called a [[livewell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hur man installerar en fisktanks Aerator Pump|trans-title=How to install a livewell aerator pump|url=http://www.drelkins.com/rykqnozoy/|website=www.drelkins.com|publisher=Drelkins|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arvor 250 AS|url=http://www.gbm.se/product/arvor-250-as/|website=www.gbm.se|publisher=GBM Marin AB|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Digital Interface for Video and Audio''' ('''DIVA''' or '''DiiVA''') was a proposal for a bi-directional audio/video interface for transmitting both compressed and uncompressed digital streams. 
It was developed by Synerchip Company, Limited, based in [[Guangzhou]] and [[Sunnyvale, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Synerchip Raises $10.5 Million Series C Round |url=http://www.jafcoasia.com/newsroom/SYNERCHIP%20Press%20Release.pdf |work=Press Release |date=April 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319011542/http://www.jafcoasia.com/newsroom/SYNERCHIP%20Press%20Release.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DIVA supports a downstream data rate (from source to display) of 13.5 Gbit/s which is capable of [[deep color]] at resolutions higher than 1080p.&lt;ref name="DIVATech"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diva-interface.org/technology.html |title=Technology |publisher=DIVA Promoters Group |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090925110030/http://www.diva-interface.org/technology.html |archivedate= September 25, 2009 |accessdate= June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
DIVA also supports a 2.25 Gbit/s bi-directional communication data channel that can carry multiple sub-channels (audio, control, compressed video, etc.).&lt;ref name="DIVATech"/&gt; This gives DIVA a raw bi-directional data rate of 18 Gbit/s or a usable bi-directional data rate of 14.4 Gbit/s (because of [[8b/10b encoding]]).&lt;ref name="Synerchip"&gt;{{cite news |title=Synerchip Reveals Aim with New AV Interface 'DIVA' |publisher=Tech On |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20080609/153012/?ST=english_PRINT |author=Naoki Asakawa |date=2008-06-09 | accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; DIVA was demonstrated at the China Digital Living Forum &amp; Showcase 2008 using a single [[Category 6a|CAT6A cable]].&lt;ref name="DIVAESM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/diva-consortium-unveils-a-new-interface-standard-for-next-generation-interactive-digital-tv-and-ce-networking-57278707.html |title=DIVA consortium unveils a new interface standard for next-generation interactive digital TV and CE networking |work= Press release |date= May 21, 2008 |accessdate= June 5, 2013 }} &lt;/ref&gt; The DIVA Promoters Group was formed by [[Changhong]], Haier, Hisense, Konka, Panda, Skyworth, SVA, [[TCL Corporation]] and Synerchip.&lt;ref name="DIVAAbout"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.diva-interface.org/about.html |title=About DIVA |publisher=DIVA Promoters Group |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090106190346/http://www.diva-interface.org/about.html |archivedate= January 6, 2009 |accessdate= June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In February 2008, the DIVA Promoters Group hoped to finish the specs for DIVA by the end of 2008 and have DIVA chips released in 2009 or 2010.&lt;ref name="Synerchip"/&gt;&lt;!-- did they? --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1146">In [[information technology]], a '''disparate system''' or a disparate data system is a [[computer data processing]] system that was designed to operate as a fundamentally distinct &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/disparate&lt;/ref&gt; data processing system without exchanging data or interacting with other computer data processing systems.  [[Legacy systems]] are examples of disparate data systems as are heterogeneous database data systems.  A disparate system is often characterized as an [[information silo]] because of the data system's isolation from or incompatibility with any other data systems.

==Overview==
Each data system may be envisioned as being composed of a software layer or [[applications architecture]], a data layer or [[data architecture]], and a data processing environment layer or technical architecture.   Any of these three layers may contribute to forming a disparate data system.

{{Citations|date=February 2015}}
A '''fid''' is a conical tool traditionally made of wood or bone. It is used to work with [[rope]] and [[canvas]] in [[marlinespike seamanship]]. A fid differs from a [[marlinspike]] in material and purpose. A marlinspike is used in working with wire rope, may be used to open shackles, and is made of metal. A fid is used to hold open knots and holes in canvas, and to separate the "lays" (or strands) of synthetic or natural rope for [[Rope splicing|splicing]].  A variation of the fid, the [[gripfid]], is used for [[ply-split braiding]]. It adds a jamming cleat to pull a cord back through the cord split by the fid's point.

Modern fids are typically made of aluminum, steel, or plastic.  In addition to holding rope open to assist the creation of a rope splice, modern push fids have markings for precise measurements in a variety of sizes of rope.  The length of these fids is typically 21 or 22 times the diameter of rope to be spliced.  A half-inch diameter rope would have any accompanying fid 10.5–11" in length with hash-marks denoting the long and short fid measurements. A ''short fid'' is {{frac|1|3}} a fid length and a ''long fid'' is {{frac|2|3}} the overall fid length.

Modern major rope manufacturers such as Yale Cordage, New England Ropes, and Samson Rope Technologies each have full sets of published splicing directions available on their websites.  Typically, all splice directions measurements use fid-length as the unit of measurement.

Below is a chart that shows exact measurements of full fid lengths, short fid lengths, and long fid lengths, using 21 times the diameter of the rope.

A fid is also a small, pointed tool, with a bulbous hand-grip, used in the tape-and-solder method of building stained glass. In this method, copper foil tape is adhered to the edges of the cut glass. The fid is then used to press the tape, thereby assuring adherence. The taped glass pieces are then soldered together to create the desired artwork.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75148">The '''Grubb Family Iron Dynasty''' was a succession of iron manufacturing enterprises owned and operated by Grubb family members for more than 165 years. Collectively, they were [[Pennsylvania]]'s leading iron manufacturer between 1840 and 1870.

About 1737, [[Peter Grubb (mason)|Peter Grubb]] entered the iron business after discovering the vast and rich [[Cornwall, Pennsylvania|Cornwall Iron Mines]] (Cornwall Banks) in [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon County]], about 21 miles north of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]. Peter and the next five generations of his descendants operated and expanded the business until they owned or operated in close association with at least 18 iron production operations and several thousand acres of property in eastern Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name = trail&gt;{{cite book | last = Dieffenbach | first = Susan | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Cornwall Iron Furnace, Pennsylvania Trail of History Guide | publisher = Stackpole Books  | year = 2003 | location =  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=73rVQ-XYaVQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=MOUNT+HOPE+Furnace+pennsylvania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KO6cfA2fOp&amp;sig=KJMW5fN6kNG9l9pohzIqKblxmu4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r9z9TP2wJYr0tgOZwtmvCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=MOUNT%20HOPE%20Furnace%20pennsylvania&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = dgrubb&gt;{{cite book | last = Grubb | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = The Grubb Family of Grubb's Landing, Delaware | publisher = Higginson Book Co  | year = 2008 | location =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Collection 212, Forges and Furnaces Collection, 1727 - 1921 | publisher =  | date = | location =  | url = http://www.hsp.org/files/findingaid212forgesandfurnaces.pdf | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHRP nom"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H001078_01H.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-08-21 |publisher=[[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission|PHMC]] and [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|PDT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both families' operations bowed to the advances of iron and steel technology in the latter part of the 19th century and were gradually sold between 1883 and 1926. Many of the Grubb holdings and the Cornwall Iron Mines were sold in 1902 to the Pennsylvania Steel Company (which was itself acquired by the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] in 1916). The remaining Coleman holdings and the related Robesonia Iron Company were also sold to Bethlehem Steel, in 1919 and 1926 respectively. Bethlehem Steel continued to mine iron ore at Cornwall until 1973.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;

== The people ==
In 1677, [[John Grubb]] came from Cornwall, U.K., and settled in [[Brandywine Hundred]], Delaware, where he established a tannery. His son Peter launched iron operations that eventually linked six generations of people, including:

=== 1st generation ===

:*[[Peter Grubb (mason)|Peter Grubb Sr.]] (1702–1754): Founded the Cornwall Ironworks when he discovered the vast iron ore fields at [[Cornwall, Pennsylvania|Cornwall, PA]], about 1737 and built the [[Cornwall Furnace]] and [[Hopewell (on Hammer Creek)|Hopewell Forges]] by 1742. He leased the operations to Cury &amp; Company until 1765 and removed to Wilmington, Delaware, where he bought and sold real estate and lived out his life. Succeeding family generations built their fortunes on his discovery.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

=== 2nd generation ===

:*[[Curtis Grubb]] (1730–1789): Peter's eldest son and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]]. 4/6 owner-in-common of the Cornwall Ironworks and operator of the Cornwall Furnace from 1765 to 1789. Built the Union Forge in 1882. His pending remarriage in 1783 spawned inheritance issues that led to the 1885-6 partition of the Grubb holdings. By 1795, Curtis' holdings had been sold by his heirs to Robert Coleman; they had all died by 1805.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt; Curtis did have a son, [[Jehu Grubb]], unacknowledged and not an heir, who became an early settler and leading citizen of [[Stark County, Ohio]].

:*[[Peter Grubb, Jr.|Peter Grubb Jr.]] (1740–1786): Peter's youngest son and Patriot. 2/6 owner-in-common of the Cornwall Ironworks and operator of the Hopewell Forges from 1765 to 1786. He reacted to the forced partition by building his own Mount Hope Furnace in 1784 to compete with his brother; he took his own life in 1786. His heirs rebuilt the family iron business from Mount Hope in the 19th century.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

=== 3rd generation ===

:*Peter Grubb III (1757–1805): Curtis' eldest son and heir, was actually called Peter Jr. at the time to distinguish him from his uncle Peter; however, this article uses Peter III to distinguish him from his uncle Peter Jr. A former officer and prisoner of war in the Revolution, he began the gradual sale of the Grubb holdings to Robert Coleman when he sold his inherited 1/3 share of the Hopewell Forges and 1/6 share of the rest of the Cornwall Ironworks to him in 1785.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

:*Curtis Grubb Jr. (1772–1790): Curtis' son and principal heir, inherited his father's remaining 3/6 share of the Cornwall Ironworks but soon left it to his sister Elizabeth when he died as a teenager in 1790. He mentioned his half-brother [[Jehu Grubb]] in his will.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

:*Elizabeth Grubb (c. 1775 – after 1795): Curtis' daughter and subsequent heir, inherited the 3/6 share of the Cornwall Ironworks from her late brother Curtis Jr. and furthered the gradual sale of the Grubb holdings to Robert Coleman by selling her share to him in 1795.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

:*Alan Burd Grubb (1772–1828): Peter Jr.'s eldest son, inherited half of his father's estate but sold it to his brother Henry in 1798 for $29,266.  He became a physician in Tennessee.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

:*[[Henry Bates Grubb]] (1774–1823): Peter Jr.'s youngest son, founded and built the 19th-century Grubb family iron empire from 1800 to 1823, building on the legacy of his father's Mount Hope Furnace and remaining 2/6 share of the Cornwall Ironworks. Henry financed his efforts, including the purchase of additional properties, with proceeds from the final sale of most of the original Grubb holdings to Robert Coleman; their transactions in 1798 and 1802 left Coleman with the Hopewell Forges and Henry with the Mount Hope Furnace and only a 1/6 interest in the Cornwall ore bank.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

He sold his half interest in the Mount Hope Estate to his younger brother Alfred in 1845 and moved to Lancaster. He left E. &amp; C.B. about that time, apparently to strike out on his own. He acquired the Chestnut Hill Ore Banks by 1851 and built the St. Charles Furnace in 1852. In 1872, Clement formed a new partnership with his son Charles (C.B. Grubb and Son) and they purchased the Henry Clay Furnace (renamed St. Charles #2) in 1875.

He continued to manage Mount Hope, and was involved with Edward and Edward's heirs until at least 1873. After Alfred's death in 1885, Mount Hope was sold back to Clement for $300,000.

{{multiple image

Cornwall, Pennsylvania, was the center of the early Grubb Family Iron Dynasty in the 18th century. It later served a similar role for the Coleman Family operations.

=== The founding (1st generation, 1734–65) ===

The Grubb family enterprises began when [[Peter Grubb (mason)|Peter Grubb]], a stonemason by training, discovered at [[Cornwall, Pennsylvania]] between 1734 and 1737, what proved to be the largest domestic iron ore deposit east of [[Lake Superior]]. Grubb purchased 1,000 acres of iron-rich property and began manufacturing activities at the [[Cornwall Iron Furnace]] and [[Hopewell (on Hammer Creek)|Hopewell Forges]] in 1742.  The business thrived at Cornwall, operating until 1765 under lease by a group of businessmen named Cury &amp; Company, while Grubb removed to [[Wilmington, Delaware]], where he lived out his life.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

=== The patriot years (2nd generation, 1765–89) ===

Peter's sons [[Curtis Grubb]] and [[Peter Grubb, Jr.]] inherited the iron works after their father died in 1754, and took over operation in 1765. The [[ironmaster]] brothers were both [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots of the American Revolution]] and Colonels of local militia; their iron works developed and supplied significant quantities of cannon and other munitions to the war effort. With the heavy demand for iron products and the accompanying inflation during the war, the brothers (and other ironmasters) realized handsome profits in the service of their new country. Curtis added the Union Forge to the holdings about 1782. They continued to operate the iron works, producing several hundred tons annually, Curtis at the Cornwall Furnace and Peter at the Hopewell Forges, until they died, Peter Jr. in 1786 and Curtis in 1789. Their residential mansions at both locations still stand today.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

=== The partition and divestiture (1783–1803) ===

The Grubb brothers unfortunately had a serious falling out beginning in 1783, when Curtis' pending remarriage spawned inheritance anxieties by his oldest son Peter III, 26, who had been a Captain of the [[Continental Army]] and a prisoner of war. Curtis acquiesced and decided to give his son his inheritance before the wedding, which subsequently required the courts to formally partition the family operations and allocate ownership shares among Curtis, Peter Jr., and Peter III.

Peter Jr. retained a 2/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges but only a 1/3 interest in the rest of the holdings (Cornwall Furnace and Ore Banks, and Union Forge&lt;ref name = unionforge /&gt;). Peter III received the remaining 1/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges, plus a 1/6 interest in the rest.  Peter Jr. feared for the future supply of raw pig iron to his Hopewell Forges that was to become his legacy to his sons, so he decided to build his own furnace at a place south of Cornwall he called [[Mount Hope Estate|Mount Hope]], where he had purchased 212 acres. The brothers were now in competition and their relations became increasingly acrimonious. Peter III grew concerned for the business and sold his holdings (1/3 share of the Hopewell Forges and 1/6 share of the rest) to a family friend, Robert Coleman, on September 26, 1785, for 8,500 pounds of gold. All of this weighed heavily on Peter Jr., who had gone deeply into debt to build his furnace; the pressures of competing family operations, and his own poor health, led him to take his own life at Hopewell on January 17, 1786.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

After Curtis' subsequent passing in 1789, none of his heirs were willing or able to manage the operations and there were complex family inheritance and legal issues still to be resolved by the courts. [[Robert Coleman (industrialist)|Robert Coleman]] had worked for the brothers and was in a position to step in as the family became increasingly unable to manage the business. As a result, in 1895 Curtis' remaining heirs sold their 3/6 interest to Coleman, and by 1803 he had acquired the Hopewell Forges and 5/6 of the rest of the original properties. A successful [[ironmaster]] and businessman in his own right, Coleman took over the Cornwall operations, acquired other properties, and went on to become Pennsylvania's first millionaire.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

It was fortunate for Peter Jr.'s heirs that he decided to begin iron-making operations at Mount Hope. Since the Colemans were now operating out of Cornwall, Mount Hope was destined to become the headquarters of a new and much larger Grubb family iron business.

== The Mount Hope era (1800–1902) ==

Mount Hope Estate was the headquarters of the Grubb Family iron manufacturing operations during the 19th Century.

=== The Rebirth (3rd generation, 1800–30) ===

[[Henry Bates Grubb]], building on his father's legacy, founded the 19th-century Grubb family iron empire.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

Henry was the youngest of Peter Jr.'s two sons who inherited their father's estate in 1786, well before they came of age.  The estate included 3,741 acres of iron-rich Cornwall land, 2/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges, plus 221 acres and their father's new furnace at Mount Hope. Henry, unlike his older brother Alan, was quite interested in the iron business and had several competent advisers whom the brothers had selected as guardians of their estate. He purchased his brother's share in 1798, to be paid over time, and began to rebuild the business, apparently with the cooperation of Robert Coleman. Henry was barely seventeen when he began a series of transactions to rebuild the family iron business, acquiring several properties. The combined operations grew to become one of the largest iron producers in Pennsylvania during the 19th century.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;

:*In 1798 Henry purchased his brother Alan's share of the inheritance, to be paid over time. Shortly thereafter he financed his rebuilding plans with the sale of a half interest in his properties to Robert Coleman.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

:*In 1800 Henry built the Mount Vernon Furnace at [[Conewago Creek (east)|Conewago Creek]], on 4,000 acres in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]].&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt; He also purchased the Hellam Iron Works in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]] and renamed it the [[Codorus Township, Pennsylvania|Codorus]] Forge.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;&lt;ref name = indiansteps&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Ruins of Codorus Furnace &amp; Forge | publisher = Indian Steps Museum  | date = | location =  | url = http://www.indiansteps.org/07-near.html | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*In 1802, Henry agreed to the partition of the common holdings between himself and Coleman, in order to obtain additional funds to pay off his brother. Coleman received Henry's interest in the Hopewell Forges and another 1/6 interest in the Cornwall ore banks, while Henry retained a 1/6 interest in the ore banks to supply his Mount Hope furnace which he now fully owned.&lt;ref name=dibert /&gt;

:*In 1803 Henry purchased 2,500 acres on [[Manada Creek]] in [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]] on which his sons later built a furnace.&lt;ref name=forgesfurnaces /&gt;

:*In 1800 - 1805, Henry built the 12 room formal Federal-style mansion at [[Mount Hope Estate]], including the extensive formal gardens. Mount Hope Estate was the headquarters of the new Grubb family iron empire and at one time comprised nearly 30 structures surrounded by a wall, all constructed of locally quarried red sandstone.&lt;ref name="NHRP nom" /&gt;

Henry's holdings grew to include at least three iron manufacturing operations, over 6,500 acres of land and a 1/6 interest in the Cornwall ore banks, all managed from Mount Hope. He died in 1823, leaving his widow Harriet Amelia Buckley Grubb to oversee the operations until their sons began to come of age in 1830.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

=== The peak production years (4th generation, 1840–75) ===

Henry's three sons ([[Edward Burd Grubb, Sr.|Edward Burd Grubb]], [[Clement Brooke Grubb]] and Alfred Bates Grubb) took over the family business when they came of age beginning in 1830. They greatly expanded the family's operations to become Pennsylvania's leading iron producers from 1840 to 1870, with their headquarters at [[Mount Hope Estate]].&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHRP nom" /&gt;

Edward was sent to Europe in 1830 to study the latest iron technology, apparently a worthwhile family investment in the future growth of the business. In 1833 Edward and Clement assumed control of the business under the name E. &amp; C.B. Alfred's involvement probably began when he came of age in 1839.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

Clement apparently decided to strike out on his own, as he resigned from E. &amp; C.B in 1845 and sold his half interest in the Mount Hope Estate to his younger brother Alfred for $25,000. He moved to Lancaster, where he built a large Greek Revival mansion that is now the Lancaster Museum of Art. About the same time Edward removed with his family to [[Burlington, NJ]], where he became a prominent citizen of that area.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

Alfred was left to manage the Mount Hope Estate and Furnace, in partnership with Edward and his heirs, which he continued until at least 1873. After his death in 1885, the Mount Hope Estate was sold back to Clement for $300,000.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = hopesale /&gt;

Clement acquired several operations at other locations, including two newer-technology [[Anthracite iron|anthracite furnaces]] near [[Columbia, PA]], along the [[Susquehanna River]].

:*1851 - Clement, having acquired the Chestnut Hill Ore Bank, incorporated the Chestnut Hill Iron Ore Company.&lt;ref name = lakegrubb&gt;{{Cite web| title = Lake Grubb Nature Park | url = http://localism.com/blog/pa/silver_spring/posts/400815/Lake-Grubb-Nature-Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The post-Civil War years (5th generation, 1870–1900) ===

Grubb family members owned and/or operated eleven iron manufacturing operations after the Civil War, when iron was in great demand to meet the needs of an expanding country. Old plants were acquired or upgraded and a new one was built. The Cornwall ore banks continued to supply large quantities of ore to both the iron and newer steel industries. But the expansion of ironworks proved to be short-lived, as the transition to steel production was on the horizon.

:*The Codorus Iron Mine (Grubb's Bank) was mined from 1866 to 1874 under C. B. Grubb and Son.

:*The Manada Furnace (charcoal) continued in production under the Grubb family until 1875.

:*The Mount Hope Furnace (charcoal) continued in production under Alfred Bates Grubb until his death in 1885.

:*The Conewago Furnace (anthracite) was upgraded in 1879 and continued in production under the Conewago Iron Company until 1888.

:*The two St. Charles Furnaces (anthracite), one acquired in 1875, continued in production under C.B. Grubb &amp; Son until 1886 &amp; 1889.

:*The Joanna Furnace (charcoal) was technologically upgraded in 1889 and continued in production under Clement's son-in-law L. Heber Smith until his death in 1898.

:*The two Chickies Furnaces (anthracite), acquired in 1868 and 1888, continued in production under Haldeman, Grubb &amp; Company until 1899.

:*The Chestnut Hill Ore Bank continued to be mined under Charles Brooke Grubb until 1907.

:*The Lebanon Valley Furnace (anthracite &amp; coke), built in 1867, continued in production under Gen. E. Burd Grubb, who probably retired in 1911.

=== End of a dynasty (1898–1911) ===

The charcoal- and anthracite-based iron manufacturing business rather quickly succumbed to newer technology and the transition to the steel industry that located further west. The ten Grubb family furnaces and mines listed above were shut down over just a 25-year period. Daisy Grubb sold some of her inherited industrial holdings and C. Ross Grubb, as President of the Cornwall Ore Bank Company, sold the Cornwall Iron Mines, both in 1902, to the Pennsylvania Steel Company (later acquired by Bethlehem Steel Company in February, 1916).&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = pasteelco&gt;{{Cite web| title = Family of Henry Bates Grubb | url = http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~duffy/reports/grubb/rr01_031.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; E. Burd Grubb continued to operate  the Lebanon Valley Furnace until about 1911.&lt;ref name = lebanonvalley/&gt; The dispositions of the other Grubb properties have not been determined, but may have also been acquired by Pennsylvania Steel.

The final fifth-generation members of the Grubb Family Iron Dynasty generally went into well-funded retirements. Of Clement's heirs, Charles Brooke Grubb died a batchelor at his Lancaster home in 1911; Ella Jane (Grubb) Smith died in 1920; Daisy Grubb renovated the Mount Hope Estate and may have died there in 1936.  Of Edward Burd Grubb's heirs, Gen. E. Burd Grubb ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1908, lost his fortune in a bad investment, and died in Newark in 1913; Henry Bates Grubb died in Burlington in 1919; C. Ross Grubb owned a chateau in Normandy, a villa on the Riviera, and an estate at Manada where he died in 1928. Sixth-generation Parker Ross Grubb died at 45 while golfing in Switzerland in 1920.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

The Cornwall Iron Mines, that had been the source of the family's wealth, continued in production under Bethlehem Steel until operations were ended by a 1973 flood resulting from
[[Hurricane Agnes]]; it had been mined continuously for 234 years.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;

== The Daisy Grubb era (1890–1936) ==

Daisy Elizabeth Brooke Grubb was Clement Grubb's youngest child. Never married, she inherited holdings worth $6 million from her father in 1889 and became a wealthy Lancaster [[spinster]] and [[socialite]] who lived at [[Mount Hope Estate]] and at her father's mansion in downtown Lancaster; she also had a town home in Philadelphia. In 1902, she sold most of her inherited industrial holdings to Pennsylvania Steel Company.&lt;ref name = pasteelco /&gt; In 1895, she began renovating her 12-room Federal-style Mount Hope mansion, enlarging it into a 32-room Victorian mansion where she entertained extensively. She retained the formal gardens established by her grandfather. Grubb was the last family member to live at Mount Hope, where she may have died in 1936. The estate is now privately owned and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Her will left a trust fund to the Hope Episcopal Church, which was built by her grandmother, and the rest to descendants of her sisters.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NHRP nom" /&gt;

== Properties and companies ==

The following properties were owned and operated over time by members of the Grubb family, or were closely associated with their operations. Presented in the approximate order of their appearance in the family dynasty. The early furnaces were charcoal-fired, and so were located on or near large tracts of hardwood forests that supplied the charcoal. Later furnaces (after about 1845) were fired by anthracite coal and/or coke, and were located near waterways or railroads that could transport the coal-based fuel mined elsewhere. Forges transformed the pig iron, produced by the furnaces, into final products.

=== Cornwall Iron Mines ===

The [[Cornwall, Pennsylvania|Cornwall Iron Mines]] in [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon County]], also known as the Cornwall Ore Banks, were the foundation of the Grubb Family Iron Dynasty. Discovered by [[Peter Grubb (mason)|Peter Grubb]], who had acquired 1,000 acres by 1737, they proved to be the largest domestic iron ore deposit east of Lake Superior, and were once the largest open pit iron mine in the world. The ore was primarily [[magnetite]]. While the majority interest in the mines were gradually acquired by [[Robert Coleman (industrialist)|Robert Coleman]] by 1803, the descendants of [[Peter Grubb, Jr.]] retained a 1/6 interest as tenants in common.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

The Cornwall Ore Bank Company was formed in 1864 to operate the mines for the benefit of the owners - by then numbering 96!  The company operated the mines until they were sold in 1902 to the Pennsylvania Steel Company, which was later acquired by the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]]) in February, 1916.&lt;ref name = orebankcompany&gt;{{cite book | title = Notes on Cornwall Ore Bank Company | publisher = Lebanon County Historical Society Deposit of Manuscript Collections  | url = http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/Bah/DAM/mg/mg182.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also an open pit mine sold to Bethlehem Steel by the Coleman heirs in 1919.

The mines produced high quality iron ore and other valuable minerals for 234 years, growing to over a million tons per year, until they were flooded by [[Hurricane Agnes]] and then closed permanently in 1973.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;

Acreage = 1,000 acres in 1737. 10,261 acres in 1786 (6,520 owned by Curtis Grubb &amp; Robert Coleman, 3,741 by Peter Grubb, Jr.'s heirs)

=== Cornwall Furnace ===

The [[Cornwall Furnace]] in Lebanon County was built by Peter Grubb in 1742 to process ore from his nearby Cornwall Iron Mines and supply pig iron to his Hopewell Forges. A cold blast charcoal fired furnace, it had a reported output capacity of 32 tons per week and supplied pig iron to six local and Philadelphia forges. After Cury &amp; Co.'s 20-year lease expired about 1765, the furnace was jointly owned by Peter's sons [[Curtis Grubb|Curtis]] and [[Peter Grubb, Jr.|Peter Jr.]] Curtis, the majority partner, operated the furnace and Peter ran the Hopewell Forges. The brothers were enthusiastic [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] and their iron works supplied cannon and other munitions to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] effort during their ownership, which ended with Curtis' death in 1789.

Curtis Grubb's heirs found themselves unable or unwilling to operate the business and in 1795 they sold their interests to Robert Coleman, who had already acquired a partial interest in the business and had been managing it for them. Coleman and his heirs operated Cornwall Furnace, with various improvements over the years, until it was closed down in 1883. It has been preserved in excellent condition and the property was deeded to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1932 by the Coleman heirs. Cornwall Furnace is now open to the public and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

=== Hopewell Forges ===

The [[Hopewell (on Hammer Creek)|Hopewell Forges]] on Hammer Creek (not to be confused with the [[Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site]]), were part of the original Grubb iron works, built by Peter Grubb (the elder) in 1742 to turn pig iron from Cornwall Furnace into final iron products. After 1765, Peter's sons Curtis and Peter Jr. assumed joint ownership of their father's holdings, including the forges. Peter Jr., the minority partner, lived nearby and operated the forges until his death in 1786. See {{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Hopewell Forge Mansion &amp; Historic Marker | publisher =  | date = | location =  | url = http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM7GCF_Hopewell_Forge_Mansion | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}

The forges, however, became central to a Grubb family tragedy and other unintended consequences. In 1783, Curtis' son Peter III had been given an interest in the family iron works by his father as an advance inheritance. The courts then had to determine how best to partition the overall assets. Peter III was given a 1/6 interest in the ore fields and a 1/3 interest in the forges, making him partners with his uncle Peter. Neither were happy with the arrangement and in 1785 Peter III sold his share of the forges (and the ore fields) to Robert Coleman, who thus became Peter Jr.'s partner. Peter Jr. became even more concerned for his business situation, especially for the supply of pig iron from his brother's Cornwall Furnace, and decided to build his own furnace at Mount Hope. He went deeply into debt and the pressures of the situation led him to commit suicide at Hopewell in 1786.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

These events related to the forges had another unintended consequence. As part of the sale to Coleman, Peter III reserved for himself and his heirs the perpetual right to remove sufficient ore from Cornwall Iron Mines to supply one furnace. This clause, particularly the definition of "one furnace," became an unsettled issue in the courts for nearly 100 years. See "Robesonia Iron Company" below.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt;

Coleman acquired the remaining interest in the Hopewell Forges in 1802, from Henry Bates Grubb. The property was among those left by Coleman to his four sons upon his death in 1825. While it is unclear when Hopewell ceased operations, it produced 250 tons in 1833,&lt;ref name = mombert&gt;{{cite book | title = An Authentic History of Lancaster County: in the State of Pennsylvania | author = J.

There is little left of the forges today except a few remnants of the dams at the creek, but Peter Grubb's mansion and historic marker can still be seen on present-day Route 322.

=== Union Forge ===

Union Forge was constructed by Curtis Grubb about 1782, near present-day Jonestown, PA, about 12 miles north of Cornwall Furnace. Curtis built the forge to process pig iron from Cornwall Furnace. Included were 1,000 acres of land, blacksmith and carpenter shops, a grist mill, and several houses. The forge continued in operation, under various owners, until 1868, when rolling mills had begun to displace forges as refiners of iron. Union Forge was initially held in common with the rest of the ironworks, and was included in the 1786 partition of the Grubb properties. While unclear, it probably remained a Curtis Grubb operation until his heirs sold to Robert Coleman in 1895.&lt;ref name = unionforge&gt;{{cite book| title = The Law of Mines and Mining in the United States | author = Daniel M.

=== Mount Hope Furnace ===

The charcoal-fired Mount Hope Furnace was built in 1785 by Peter Grubb, Jr., on 212 acres of land he purchased from Jacob Graybill in 1784, in [[Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manheim Township]] about five miles north of Lancaster. There was already an operating [[gristmill]] on the property. Peter went deeply into debt to build the furnace because he feared for the future supply of pig iron for his Hopewell Forges from his brother's Cornwall Furnace, in which Peter had only a minority interest. Peter yielded to the business pressures he found himself under and took his own life at Hopewell in 1786. His sons Alan Burd Grubb and [[Henry Bates Grubb]] inherited the furnace, which became a core asset of the future Grubb iron business.&lt;ref name = dibert /&gt; The furnace produced 1,000 tons of pig iron in 1833.&lt;ref name = mombert /&gt; The furnace was upgraded to [[hot blast]] and apparently continued in operation until at least 1885, when it was sold by Alfred Bates Grubb's estate, along with nearly 2,500 acres of land (the Mount Hope Estate), back to his brother Clement Brooke Grubb (who had sold his share to Alfred in 1845) for $300,000.&lt;ref name = hopesale&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/05/29/103020567.pdf |format=PDF |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1885-05-29 |title=An Iron Furnace Sold.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mount Hope Estate ===

The [[Mount Hope Estate]] was the enclave near Manheim that was home and headquarters of the Grubb family iron enterprises after 1800. It grew from Peter Grubb Jr.'s original 212 acres in 1786, home to the Mount Hope Furnace and gristmill, to over 2,500 acres and many buildings by 1885. The original Federal style mansion was built by Peter's son, Henry Bates Grubb, between 1800 and 1805; it was the most formal ironmaster's mansion in the area up to 1850, and featured formal gardens that are still maintained. The enclave at its peak contained nearly 30 outbuildings (including the Hope Church, built in 1848-9), most constructed of locally quarried red sandstone and enclosed by a wall of the same material.

Henry B. Grubb, who had inherited Mount Hope from his father at age 12, passed it on to his two older sons, Edward Burd Grubb and Clement Brooke Grubb, upon his death in 1823.  The Estate was managed by Henry's widow, Harriet Amelia Buckley Grubb, until the sons came of age. The brothers partnered to operate the business in 1833, under the name E. &amp; C.B. In 1845 Clement sold his half interest to their younger brother Alfred Bates Grubb for $25,000. After Alfred's death in 1885, his heirs sold Mount Hope Estate back to Clement for $300,000, in the most expensive real estate transaction in Lancaster up to that time.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = hopesale /&gt;

The last family member to live at Mount Hope was Clement's daughter Daisy Elizabeth Brooke Grubb, who inherited it from her father along with holdings worth six million dollars. In 1895 she began an extensive renovation and transformed the original 12-room structure into a 32-room Victorian mansion where she entertained many distinguished guests. Daisy lived at Mount Hope at least part of the time until she died in 1936.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

The property was subdivided and mostly sold off by the subsequent owners, but the mansion and some surrounding land was bought by Charles Romito for a winery in 1980 and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

=== Mount Vernon Furnaces and Forge ===

The Mount Vernon Furnace was the first furnace built by [[Henry Bates Grubb]], in 1800 by most references. A charcoal-fired furnace, it was located near Elizabethtown on Conewago Creek, about 15 miles southwest of Mount Hope.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;&lt;ref name = swank&gt;{{cite book | title = History of the Manufacture of Iron in All Ages | author = James Moore Swank | year = 1892 | location = Leland Stanford Jr. University Library | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nuwJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=mount+vernon+furnace+grubb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yunxq6a82R&amp;sig=adS7rGftnzUqflLKTepMao7gT4Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rqL_TP_uBJPksQOF4OivCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=mount%20vernon%20furnace%20grubb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produced 50 tons of pig iron per week (2,500 tons per year) from Cornwall ore.&lt;ref name = mtvernon2&gt;{{cite book | title = Annals of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania | author = John F.

After Henry's death in 1823, the operations were continued by his sons Edward Burd Grubb and Charles Bates Grubb, and Edward built a second furnace by the same name in 1831.&lt;ref name = swank /&gt; The iron furnaces fell out of production and were abandoned in 1852.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;

The sawmill is still in operation today and the gristmill carried on until 1913. The gristmill was still owned by Grubb &amp; Company in 1875. Its ruins can be seen on the property of the beautiful and historic Conewago Manor Inn and the sawmill can be seen nearby. The original inn was built by Samuel Smith sometime after 1739; Henry Bates Grubb added the majestic stonework structure in 1811 and named it Mount Vernon Estate.&lt;ref name = conewagomanor&gt;{{cite book | title = Mount Vernon Estate (Conewago Manor Inn) and Grist Mill Ruins | url = http://www.millpictures.com/mills/details.cfm?millid=1141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Codorus Forge and Furnace ===

The Codorus Forge was the new name given to the Hellam Forge that Henry Bates Grubb bought from Thomas Neill in 1802. The forge was located in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]], near the intersection of [[Codorus Creek]] with the [[Susquehanna River]], about 30 miles southwest of Mount Hope.

The forge, which had passed through several owners, was originally built around 1765 by William Bennett on 150 acres obtained from William Penn. The forge processed pig iron produced at nearby Mary Ann Furnace, and had supplied cannon and shot to the [[Continental Army]], probably under the ownership of James Smith, a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name = indiansteps /&gt;

Henry Grubb operated the forge until he hired John Shippen, who managed it from 1818 until 1825. Henry's widow, Harriet Amelia Buckley Grubb, oversaw its operation until their oldest sons, Edward Burd Grubb and Clement Brooke Grubb, came of age. The sons inherited the forge and began operating it in 1833 under their partnership E. &amp; C.B. They added the {{Cite web | title = Codorus Furnace | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/khonsus/4412204146/}} about 1837, transporting ore from their Chestnut Hills Mines by flat boat across the Susquehanna River. The iron products were shipped downriver to Philadelphia and Baltimore. The furnace and forge were closed sometime in the 1850s.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;

An iron ore deposit, known as Grubb's Bank (see below), was discovered on the Codorus property in 1866, well after the forge and furnace were closed down. The ore was shipped by river to the St. Charles Furnace in Columbia.

=== Manada Furnace ===

In 1803 Henry Bates Grubb purchased land from Gen. Timothy Green, on [[Manada Creek]] in the northwest part of East Hanover Township in [[Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Dauphin County]], about 60 miles east of Mount Hope.  Manada Furnace was built in 1836 by Henry's sons Clement B. &amp; Edward B. Grubb, at Sand Beach near the site of the old [[Manada Gap, Pennsylvania|Manada Fort]]. Embracing some 2,500 acres, Manada Furnace was the only charcoal furnace in Dauphin County in 1856, a year after the brothers' partnership ended.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;

The ore came from the Grubb's Chestnut Hill mine or from the Cornwall mines via the Union Canal to Lebanon. From there it was brought by wagon to the furnace. Water power from Manada Creek turned a wheel which operated the bellows that pumped air into the furnace. The water wheel was probably on the northeast corner of the furnace.  A bridge from a hill led to the top of the furnace. Men dumped wheelbarrow loads of charcoal, limestone and iron ore into the top. The furnace produced pig iron and also did some casting of products. From 1837 to 1848 the furnace produced over 22,000 tons of iron. The metal was sent to the Swatara railroad station for transport.&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;&lt;ref name = indiantown&gt;{{cite book | title = Manada Furnace-Preliminary Report Fort Indiantown Gap Youth Conservation Corps | date =  August 18, 1979 | url = http://www.wwiifederation.org/igmr_history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community surrounding the furnace consisted of a general store, the iron master's house, a smoke house, boarding house, and twenty two log cabins. The church is still in existence as the United Christian Episcopal Manada Furnace Church. At the peak of operations, the furnace employed 75 men.  Two hundred acres were used for farming for the families of furnace workers. In September 1861 the furnace workers formed the 46th Regiment, D Company to fight in the Civil War. The company was disbanded on July 16, 1865.&lt;ref name = indiantown /&gt; During the Civil War, the owners of Manada Furnace were able to use Confederate prisoners from [[Camp Curtin]] to work as woodcutters and laborers. Many are buried at {{Cite web | title = Manada Confederate Graveyard | url = http://www.civilwaralbum.com/misc2/manadagap1.htm}}

=== E. &amp; C.B. ===

A partnership formed in 1833 by Henry's sons Edward Burd Grubb and Clement Brooke Grubb to run the family business from Mount Hope Estate. The partnership continued until 1845 when Clement sold his share to his younger brother Alfred Bates Grubb. By then, Edward had removed to Burlington, NJ and Clement to Lancaster, PA. The companies and properties listed below involved only Clement and Edward and their heirs, as Alfred's did not join the family iron business.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

=== E.B &amp; A.B Grubb Company ===

A partnership formed in 1845 between Henry's sons Edward Burd Grubb, Sr. and Alfred Bates Grubb to manage Mt. Hope Estate and Furnace after their brother Clement ended his partnership with Edward.  After Edward's death in 1867, Alfred carried on, with Edward's heirs, until 1873.&lt;ref name = pareports /&gt;

=== Chestnut Hill Ore Bank ===

The Chestnut Hill Ore Bank, acquired by Clement Brooke Grubb by 1851, was about eight miles west of Lancaster, at Silver Spring near [[Columbia, Pennsylvania|Columbia]]. The several ore properties at Chestnut Hill, which adjoin each other, were, when taken as a whole, one of the largest [[hematite]] ore deposits in Pennsylvania. Ore was first discovered on the Greider farm, between 1825 and 1832, by the engineer Simeon Guilford. Most of the furnaces in and around Columbia and Chickies depended on these mines for their principal supply of ore.&lt;ref name = chestnut1&gt;{{cite book | title = Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society, Volume I | year = 1897 | url = https://archive.org/stream/georgerossmemori01lancrich/georgerossmemori01lancrich_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grubb tract, about 13 acres, was developed by Jerome Boyer around 1839 and acquired and further developed by Clement Brooke Grubb sometime prior to 1851, when the Chestnut Hill Iron Ore Company was incorporated.&lt;ref name = lakegrubb /&gt;  Various tracts at Chestnut Hill were owned, in 1869, by Clement Brooke Grubb, heirs of his brother [[Edward Burd Grubb, Sr.]], the Chestnut Hill Iron Ore Company, the Silver Spring Iron Ore Company, and other owners of small outcroppings.&lt;ref name = mombert /&gt; In 1904, the property was owned by Clement's son, Charles Brooke Grubb. The ore bank supplied thousands of tons of iron ore to the Grubb's Codorus and Manada furnaces and to other nearby anthracite furnaces, such as the St. Charles Furnaces, until 1907.&lt;ref name = chestnut2 /&gt;

The ore pit, about 13 acres and 110 feet deep, has since filled with water, creating {{Cite web | title = Lake Grubb | url = http://lancasterrealtycheck.com/post/118864/lake-grubb-nature-park-walking-trail }}, part of a modern-day 54 acre recreational area in [[Silver Spring, Pennsylvania]].

=== Columbia Furnace ===

The Grubb Family Papers, 1814–1869, mention a Columbia Furnace 1853 - 1860.&lt;ref name = papers&gt;{{cite book | title = Grubb Family Papers, 1814 - 1869 |location = Historical Society of Pennsylvania | url = http://www2.hsp.org/collections/manuscripts/0200.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These sources have not been reviewed and no other references to a furnace by that name have been found. They likely relate to the Grubb-owned St. Charles Furnace in Columbia.

=== St. Charles Furnace #1 ===

Clement Brooke Grubb built the {{Cite web | title = St. Charles Furnace | url = http://www.rivertownes.org/Features/Furnaces/StCharles.htm}} in 1854, at Columbia near the Susquehanna River about 12 miles west of Lancaster, on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Years later, in 1875, Grubb and his son Charles bought the Henry Clay Furnace, about a mile upriver, and renamed it St. Charles No. 2. Both furnaces were fired by anthracite coal. Together, these two furnaces had an annual capacity of over 20,000 tons of pig iron, which was well known for its quality for boiler plate, bars, nails and foundry work. In 1863 Grubb built a large iron ore roaster, the first of its kind in Lancaster County, to remove sulfur from the local ores used in the furnaces. The St Charles Furnace was remodeled in 1879–80, but only six years later in 1886 it went out of blast for the last time. It was dismantled in 1897; some remains can be seen from the Route 30 bridge.&lt;ref name = rivertownes /&gt;&lt;ref name = stcharles1 /&gt;

=== C.B Grubb and Son ===

C.B. Grubb and Son was a partnership formed about 1872 between Clement Brooke Grubb and his son Charles Brooke Grubb. It presumably endured until Clement's death in 1889.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt; The partnership owned both St. Charles Furnaces&lt;ref name = henryclay /&gt;&lt;ref name = stcharles1 /&gt; and the Codorus Iron Mine, also known as Grubb's Bank.&lt;ref name = codorusore /&gt; They likely also had an interest in the Chestnut Hill Ore Banks, since they were owned by Charles in 1904.

=== Henry Clay Furnace (St. Charles Furnace #2) ===

In 1875 C.B. Grubb and Son (Clement and Charles) bought the {{Cite web | title = Henry Clay Furnace | url = http://www.rivertownes.org/Features/Furnaces/HenryClay.htm}}, located about a mile up the Susquehanna River from Clement's St. Charles Furnace, on the Pennsylvania Canal and the Pennsylvania Railroad. They renamed it St. Charles No. 2.

The Henry Clay furnace was one of the first of the anthracite-fired furnaces along the Susquehanna between Columbia and Marietta. It was built in 1845 by Peter Haldeman, but changed hands several times after 1855, producing only sporadically until 1865 when, after a long period of idleness it was blown in again under the proprietorship of the firm Denney and Hess.  In 1875 Clement and Charles purchased and renamed it St. Charles Furnace No. 2. Together, the two St. Charles furnaces had an annual capacity of over 20,000 tons of pig iron. The furnace was remodeled in 1879, 1880 and again in 1887, but its production declined and it was abandoned in 1889. Ruins of the onsite tenement building can still be seen today.&lt;ref name = henryclay /&gt;

=== Codorus Iron Mine (Grubb's Bank) ===

The Codorus Iron Mine, better known in later years as Grubb's Bank, was discovered on the Codorus property in 1866. The owner in 1874 was C. B. Grubb and Son. Since the Codorus Furnace was by then shut down, the ore was hauled to the Susquehanna River and floated to the St. Charles Furnaces in Columbia. The mine, less than an acre in size, contained ore consisting of a mixture of magnetite and hematite in sandstone. About 25,000 tons were removed by 1874, with seven men typically working to take about 25 tons per day.&lt;ref name = codorusore /&gt;

=== The Grubb &amp; Haldeman companies ===

The Haldeman family were prominent iron manufacturers in the Chickies area in Lancaster County. The Grubbs and Haldemans formed several business relationships, beginning in 1869, to own and operate three anthracite furnaces.

In 1869, heirs of Edward B. Grubb Sr. joined the firm of E. Haldeman &amp; Company, after its founder retired. Those heirs apparently were Henry Bates Grubb and his brother C. Ross Grubb, both of whom became officers in other Grubb/Haldeman companies. C. Ross Grubb had purchased the Eagle Furnace, and the Chickies Iron Company was formed in 1876.&lt;ref name = grubbhaldeman /&gt;

By 1882, Paris Haldeman, Henry Bates Grubb, and Horace Haldeman had formed the Conewago Iron Company, owners of the Conewago Furnace in Dauphin County. This relationship continued until at least 1892, by which time C. Ross Grubb had succeeded Paris Haldeman as President. The furnace under their ownership supplied the Chickies Iron Company exclusively, but went out of blast in 1888.&lt;ref name = conewago1 /&gt;&lt;ref name = conewagofurnace /&gt;

In 1888, the firm of Haldeman, Grubb &amp; Company was formed as a partnership, between Paris Haldeman, C. Ross Grubb, and Horace L. Haldeman.  Horace was the managing partner, and Paris retired in 1891. The firm owned Chickies Furnace #1 (formerly the Chickies Furnace, that had been built and owned by the Haldemans) and Chickies Furnace #2 (previously the Eagle Furnace, that had been acquired by Grubb in 1869).

=== Eagle Furnace (Chickies Furnace #2) ===

The anthracite-fired {{Cite web | title = Eagle Furnace | url = http://www.rivertownes.org/Features/Furnaces/Chickies2.htm}} (later renamed Chickies Furnace #2), was built in 1854 on the floodplain between Marietta and Columbia just north of Chickies Creek by Stephen Eagle. Eagle operated the furnace until 1869, when it was purchased by C. Ross Grubb, son and heir of Edward Burd Grubb, Sr. and brother of E. Burd Grubb, Jr. He later became associated with E. Haldeman and Company, who owned and operated the Chickies Furnace. The Haldeman company managed the furnace, remodeled it several times and changed the name to Chickies #2. Haldeman, Grubb &amp; Co. was formed in 1888 to take ownership of Chickies #2 and the nearby Chickies #1. The principal ores used at both Chickies furnaces were obtained from the Grubb and Haldeman's Chestnut Hill ore mines at Silver Springs, some six miles from the furnaces, and from Cornwall, Lebanon County. In the late 1880s the furnace was extensively rebuilt, a two-story engine house was added, and the furnace operated successfully until it was shut down in 1899. Remnants of the furnace, including the still-occupied engine house, can be seen today.&lt;ref name = chickies2 /&gt;&lt;ref name = chickies2again /&gt;

=== Conewago Furnace ===

The Conewago Furnace, formerly the Middletown Furnace, was in Middletown, Dauphin County. The furnace, built in 1853 and rebuilt in 1879, was owned in 1882 by the Conewago Iron Company, a Grubb and Haldeman partnership. Paris Haldeman was President, Henry Bates Grubb was Vice-President, and Horace Haldeman was Treasurer.  It was fueled by anthracite and coke, and the ores were from Cornwall and Chestnut Hill. The product was "Chickies" pig iron, made exclusively by contract for the Chickies Iron Company. The Conewago Furnace went out of blast in 1888.&lt;ref name = conewagofurnace /&gt;

=== Chickies Furnace (Chickies Furnace #1) ===

Henry Haldeman built the first {{Cite web | title = Chickies Furnace | url = http://www.rivertownes.org/Features/Furnaces/Chickies1.htm}} near the base of Chickies Rock, in Lancaster County, in 1845. Haldeman's sons Edwin and Samuel took over his business holdings later that same year and brought the anthracite-fired furnace into blast in 1846. The furnace was rarely out of blast and with several remodellings to implement technological advancements, it produced 17,000 tons of pig iron per year by the late 19th century.  In 1888, Paris and Horace Haldeman partnered with C. Ross Grubb, who owned the nearby Eagle Furnace, to form Haldeman, Grubb and Company. They renamed the furnace Chickies #1 and renamed Eagle Furnace Chickies #2; operating both furnaces until they were shut down in 1899. The principal ores used at the Chickies furnaces were obtained from the Grubb and Haldeman's Chestnut Hill ore mines at Silver Springs, some six miles from the furnaces, and from Cornwall, Lebanon County.&lt;ref name = chickies1&gt;{{cite book| title = Chickies Furnace #1 | author = Rivertownes PA USA | url = http://www.rivertownes.org/Features/Furnaces/Chickies1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lebanon Valley Furnace Company ===

The Lebanon Valley Furnace Company was formed in 1865 by Edward Burd Grubb, Sr. as the first president. His eldest son, Gen. E. Burd Grubb, Jr., became president after his father's death in 1867.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt; In 1902 the company formally acquired, from Gen. Grubb, both the Lebanon Valley Furnace and his interest in the Cornwall Iron Mines.&lt;ref name = lebanonvalley2&gt;{{cite book| title = Steel and iron, Volume 70 | year = 1902 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TEQAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA658&amp;lpg=PA658&amp;dq=lebanon+valley+furnace+company+grubb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X02gP--Ttj&amp;sig=aQi5zWNhvtULHL-N7WcEZhLHAbU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tcYzTeW-EYeusAOv2fXeBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=lebanon%20valley%20furnace%20company%20grubb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company still owned and operated the furnace in 1907.&lt;ref name = lebanonvalley /&gt;

E. Burd Grubb may have been the last Grubb family member to retire from the iron business, probably in 1911 when he lost his fortune in a bad investment.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

=== Lebanon Valley Furnace ===

The Lebanon Valley Furnace, in Lebanon, PA, was built in 1865-7, probably by the Lebanon Valley Furnace Company, who formally acquired it from Gen. E. Burd Grubb in 1902.&lt;ref name = lebanonvalley2 /&gt; Gen. E. Burd Grubb had become the owner when his father died, shortly before the furnace was blown for the first time in 1867.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt; The furnace was a modern anthracite- and coke-fired furnace that was remodeled in 1884 and rebuilt in 1904, producing an output of pig iron, under the "Lebanon Valley" brand, of 24,000 tons per year. It was still active in 1907&lt;ref name = lebanonvalley /&gt; and most likely continued under Grubb's control until 1911.

=== Cornwall Ore Bank Company ===

The Grubbs were minority partners in the Cornwall Ore Bank Company, as they continued to hold a 1/6 interest in the ore banks. The company was formed in 1864 to operate the Cornwall mines for the benefit of the owners - by then numbering 96 tenants in common!  The company operated the mines until they were sold in 1902 to the Pennsylvania Steel Company, which was itself acquired by the [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] in February, 1916.&lt;ref name = orebankcompany/&gt; The President of the Cornwall Ore Bank Company when the mines were sold was C. Ross Grubb, representing the Grubb family's fifth generation in the iron business.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;

=== Joanna Furnace ===
{{Main article|Joanna Furnace Complex}}

While not formally a Grubb property, the charcoal-fired {{Cite web | title = Joanna Furnace | url = http://www.haycreek.org/joanna_furnace.htm}} was owned by Clement Grubb's son-in-law, L. Heber Smith, a Civil War Colonel who married Clement's daughter Ella Jane Brooke Grubb in 1868. Located in Berks County, the furnace was built in 1792 and named for Joanna Potts, wife of the principal owner. It passed through several hands before Smith took ownership, probably after the war and before his marriage to Ella Jane. It is not unreasonable to assume that the Grubbs assisted with the furnace's major technological upgrade in 1889, especially since Ella Jane would have been an heiress to her father's sizable estate that year. The furnace continued in operation under Smith until it was "blown out" after his death in 1898 at the age of 61. The furnace was acquired by Bethlehem Steel, who deeded it to the Hay Creek Valley Historical Association in 1979; the ruins have been enhanced by local historians and are open to visitors.&lt;ref name = dgrubb /&gt;&lt;ref name = forgesfurnaces /&gt;&lt;ref name = joanna&gt;{{cite book| title = Joanna Furnace | author = Hay Creek Valley Historical Assn. | url = http://www.haycreek.org/joanna_furnace.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robesonia Iron Company ===

While the Robesonia Iron Company, owners of the {{Cite web | title = Robesonia Furnace | url = http://www.robesoniafurnace.org/}} at [[Robesonia, Pennsylvania|Robesonia]] in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] about 20 miles east of Cornwall, was not a Grubb property, it affected the affairs of the Grubbs and Colemans for most of the 19th century because it owned access rights to Cornwall iron ore.

After Curtis Grubb's oldest son Peter Grubb III received his inheritance in 1783, he sold his 1/3 interest in the Hopewell Forges to Robert Coleman. But as a condition of that sale Peter reserved for himself and his heirs the right of access to remove "for as long as grass grows and water flows" sufficient ore to supply "one furnace". Peter later, in 1883, sold his remaining share of the iron mines, along with these rights, to [[George Ege]] to supply his Reading Furnace in Berks County.&lt;ref name = trail /&gt;&lt;ref name = Robesonia&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Friends of the Robesonia Furnace, Inc. | publisher =  | date = | location =  | url = http://www.robesoniafurnace.org | doi = | id = | isbn = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry P. Robeson]] acquired the operation in 1845 and with it the right to access Cornwall iron ore. Robeson replaced the charcoal-fired Reading Furnace with two (in 1848 and 1855) more modern and much larger Robesonia [[Anthracite iron|Anthracite Furnaces]], while still demanding the right to access Cornwall iron ore – to supply one furnace, whichever one of the two was in operation, but not both at once. The combined capacity was many times greater than had been visualized in 1783. That right of access, especially with the interpretation of the quantities of ore permitted for "one furnace", was a highly contentious issue for years between Robeson and the Grubbs and Colemans, who jointly owned the ore banks as tenants in common. The issue languished in the courts for years and was not resolved until the state Supreme Court ruled in Robesonia's favor in 1880. As a result, in 1884, the company decided to market only one kind of pig iron called "Robesonia", made exclusively from Cornwall ore, which was consumed in large quantities.&lt;ref name = Robesonia /&gt;&lt;ref name = court&gt;{{cite book | title = Weekly notes, Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Volume 9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3wgVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA444&amp;lpg=PA444&amp;dq=grubb+iron+furnace+pennsylvania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Dl1YHDoUiM&amp;sig=u-OJLnWiV_7nP1DPfJSJeV8MBLc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wiPgTO-LEYKmsQOp5o3rCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=grubb%20iron%20furnace%20pennsylvania&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, the Bethlehem Steel Company, owners of the Cornwall iron mines since 1916, acquired Robesonia. In order to protect the mines from the enormous amounts of ore being consumed, Bethlehem Steel elected to shut down the Robesonia furnaces in 1927.&lt;ref name = Robesonia /&gt;

Karp is best known for his techniques for calming infants and promoting sleep. He is the author of a series of books and DVDs on parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scholastic.com/parents/resources/article/parent-child/10-most-influential-people-family-life-today-0|title=The 10 Most Influential People In Family Life Today|newspaper=Scholastic.com|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
From 1982 to 1984 Karp practiced pediatrics with pediatrician [[Paul Fleiss]] in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Jay|title=Remembering Dr. Paul Fleiss: 5 Decades in Pediatrics|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/dr-paul-fleiss-5-decades-in-pediatrics_b_5604011.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then opened his own practice in Santa Monica, where he continued to see patients until 2005. He was assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at the UCLA School of Medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Baby Whisperer - UCLA Magazine|url = http://magazine.ucla.edu/exclusives/harvey_karp/|website = UCLA Magazine|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1989 to 2009, where he served as pediatric liaison to the Child Abuse Team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/health/article/Shhh-UCLA-pediatrician-develops-the-Cuddle-1092657.php|title=Shhh.... UCLA pediatrician develops the 'Cuddle Cure' to calm colicky infants|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as a regular contributor to the Lifetime cable television show ''Growing Up Together'' from 1990 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://productionbeast.com/projects/106947-growing-up-together|title=Growing Up Together|work=ProductionBeast}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he became an assistant professor of pediatrics at the USC Keck School of Medicine.

Karp is a founding board member of Healthy Child Healthy World,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ewg.org/about-us/board-members|title=Board Members|newspaper=EWG|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has served on the advisory boards of the Green Guide, Babycenter.com, ''Parents'', ''Ser Padres,'' and ''American Baby'' magazines.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

Most recently, Karp has collaborated with [[Yves Béhar]] to develop a "[[Smart objects|smart]]" [[bassinet]]. Karp claims that it is  able to calm fussing babies.&lt;ref name="Snoo cradle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rhodes|first1=Margaret|title=The $1,200 Snoo Robo-Cradle Will Rock Your Baby to Sleep For You|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/robo-cradle-will-rock-baby-sleep/|accessdate=19 February 2017|publisher=WIRED|date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infant calming and sleep technique==
Karp’s infant calming technique is supposed to be based on recreating the essential elements of the experience of living in the womb. Human babies, according to Karp, are born less developed than other mammals. Karp calls the first three months of life the "fourth trimester."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/06/24/155426534/dr-karp-on-parenting-and-the-science-of-sleep|title=Dr. Karp On Parenting And The Science Of Sleep|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=National Public Radio|access-date=February 19, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|department=All Things Considered|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karp hypothesizes that all babies are born with a "calming reflex" that quickly relaxes most fussy babies when they are stimulated in a way that resemble sensations that babies experience in the womb.&lt;ref&gt;Karp H, The “fourth trimester”: A framework and strategy for understanding and resolving colic, Contemporary Peds 2001;21:92-114&lt;/ref&gt; His method for soothing crying babies, the so-called 5 S's,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.today.com/parents/research-backs-power-5-ss-soothe-babies-717333|title=Research backs up the power of the 5 S's to soothe babies|last=TODAYMoms|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes [[swaddling]], side/stomach position, shushing, swinging and sucking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/08/health/colicky-baby-read-this-before-calling-an-exorcist.html|title=Colicky Baby? Read This Before Calling an Exorcist|last=Blakeslee|first=Sandra|date=2005-03-08|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding sleep, Karp recommends nightly swaddling and sound and motion sleep cues to help babies establish a circadian rhythm and to promote infant sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/06/24/155426534/dr-karp-on-parenting-and-the-science-of-sleep|title=Dr. Karp On Parenting And The Science Of Sleep|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
CBS news reports that "Critics say Karp is riding to fame on the strength of his patients' VIP parents, who include [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Endorsements from several stars appear on his book jacket and video cover."&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{Citation |last = AP|date = 2002-10-21|title = Can This Man Keep Your Baby Quiet?|publisher = CBS News|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/21/health/main526308.shtml|accessdate = 23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doctors have also expressed concern that babies may accidentally be left to sleep face down, a position which increases the risk of [[sudden infant death syndrome]]. Karp explicitly warns parents not to leave babies in this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Falcon | first=Mike | last2=Shoop | first2=Stephen A. | date=2002-09-09 | title="Happy baby doctor" calms colic crying | publisher=USA Today | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlighthealth/2002-09-09-karp_x.htm | accessdate=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralph Frenken has argued against Karp’s recommendation of the use of tight [[swaddling]] and the concept of a "calming reflex." The criticism is that the effect of swaddling is not based on [[reflex]]es because (1) a releasing stimulus is missing, because swaddling most probably works by the decrease of proprioceptive and tactile stimulation and (2) the reflex response is missing, because any reflex always consists of a movement released by muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Frenken, Ralph (2011). Psychology and history of swaddling: Part two – The abolishment of swaddling from the 16th century until today. In: The Journal of Psychohistory, 39 (3), p. 219-245.&lt;/ref&gt; The child does not move but falls asleep by swaddling. Additionally, no known reflex alters the state of consciousness, but swaddling obviously does. Lactation and breastfeeding expert, Nancy Mohrbacher, collected several scientific studies which demonstrated negative aspects of swaddling on newborn infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nancymohrbacher.com/articles/2010/12/3/rethinking-swaddling.html |title=Rethinking Swaddling — Nancy Mohrbacher |publisher=Nancymohrbacher.com |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, researchers studied the effects of video instruction concerning swaddling, side positioning, white noise, jiggling, and sucking on parents' ability to calm fussing babies. The results against a control group were statistically insignificant compared to traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;Jonna M. McRury, Adam J. Zolotor: A Randomized, Controlled Trial of a Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Crying among Infants. In: J Am Board Fam Med September 1, 2010 23:689-690.&lt;/ref&gt; Other than that, no aspect of Karp's calming techniques concerning the psychological or physical consequences on babies has been discussed by the scientific community.

Key participants in the project included organizations such as the [[US Library of Congress]], the American Society of Indexers, the [[IEEE]], the [[American Chemical Society]], the [[American Institute of Physics]], and the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref name="cave"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1108/10650750310698766| issn = 1065-075X| volume = 19| issue = 4| pages = 144–148| last = Cave| first = Francis| title = Article Metadata Standards: An Historical Review| journal = OCLC Systems &amp; Services: International Digital Library Perspectives| date = 2003-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Aspen Systems Corporation was hired to conduct the work over a two-year period. Two preliminary works with restricted distribution were produced in 1985, the draft AAP DTD&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = AAP| title = Association of American Publishers' Standard for Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Exchange.| location = Washington| date = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = AAP| title = Author Guidelines for the Preparation, Creation and Exchange of Electronic Manuscripts| location = Washington| date = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1093/comjnl/29.3.193| volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 193–200| last = Smith| first = Joan M.| title = The Implications of SGML for the Preparation of Scientific Publications| journal = The Computer Journal| date = 1986-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the Electronic Publishing Special Interest Group (EPSIG), a consortium sponsored by the [[OCLC|Online Computer Library Center]] (OCLC), recommended the DTDs developed by the Electronic Manuscript Project be used as an American Standard.&lt;ref name="cave" /&gt; With the support of the AAP and the Graphic Communications Association (GCA), the recommendations were accepted and, in 1988, the AAP DTD became the [[American National Standards Institute]]'s ''Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup'' (ANSI/NISO Z39.59) standard. Being based on the [[ASCII]]  [[character encoding]] standard, it includes a large set of entity definitions for special characters.&lt;ref name="Herwijnen-1994-111" /&gt;

The AAP and EPSIG continued their collaboration and published a revised version of the specification in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Association of American Publishers, EPSIG| title = Reference Manual on Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup (Version 2| location = Dublin, OH, USA| date = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Association of American Publishers, EPSIG| title = Author’s Guide to Electronic Manuscript Preparation and Markup (Version 2)| location = Dublin, OH, USA| date = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Association of American Publishers, EPSIG| title = Markup of tabular material (Version 2)| location = Dublin, OH, USA| date = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Association of American Publishers, EPSIG| title = Markup of mathematical formulas (Version 2)| location = Dublin, OH, USA| date = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifying three document types in the field of publishing: Book, Serial Publication, and Article, for each of which the revised specification offers a DTD.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 16| issue = 2| pages = 103–145| last1 = Goossens| first1 = Michel| last2 = Saarela| first2 = Janne| title = A practical introduction to SGML| journal = TUGboat| date = November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAP and the [[European Physical Society]] (EPS) further collaborated on a standard method for marking up tables and mathematical notation in scientific documents.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Building on this work, Eric van Herwijnen, then head of the text processing section at [[CERN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0891-2017| volume = 17| issue = 1| pages = 110–116| last = van Ess-Dkema| first = Carol| title = Review of "Practical SGML" by Eric Van Herwijnen. Kluwer Academic Publishers 1990.| journal = Computational Linguistics| date = March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited the specification for adoption by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] as ISO 12083, first published in 1993,&lt;ref name="Herwijnen-1994-111"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Herwijnen|first=Eric|title=Practical SGML|year=1994|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-9434-1|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; revised in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = ISO 12083:1994 – Information and documentation -- Electronic manuscript preparation and markup| work = International Organization for Standardization| accessdate = 2017-08-27| date = October 1994| url = https://www.iso.org/standard/20866.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and last reconfirmed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| publisher = International Organization for Standardization| title = ISO Update, Supplement to ISO Focus| date = February 2016| url=https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/news/magazine/ISOupdate/EN/2016/ISOupdate_February_2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISO 12083 features four DTDs: Article, Book, Serial, and Math.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">The International Coalition for Geoinformatics (iGeoInfo) was founded after an inaugural meeting, organized by H. Richard Lane of the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]] (NSF) and Cinzia Cervato (CHRONOS) on Friday 20 August 2004, which took place during the 32nd International Geological Congress in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Klump, Jens, Robert Huber, u. a. (2005), Workshop Launches International Coalition for GeoInformatics, EOS, Transactions, American Geophysical Union, 86(3), 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of iGeoInfo was to build a community to promote [[data sharing]] concepts, and [[geoinformatics]] in general, at an international level. Initially, the main focus of iGeoInfo was to foster the collaboration between geoinformatics initiatives in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] rooted in the fields of [[stratigraphy]], [[sedimentary geology]] and [[paleobiology]]. 

The founding members of iGeoinfo were scientists from [https://web.archive.org/web/19981205122129/http://www.chronos.org/ Chronos], [http://www.earthchem.org/ EarthChem], [http://www.paleostrat.org PaleoStrat], [http://www.pangaea.de PANGAEA], [http://www.geosamples.org SESAR] and [http://www.stratigraphy.net Stratigraphy.net]. Several other initiatives and programs joined later such as [http://www.geon.org GEON] and [http://www.paleodb.org PaleoDB].

The '''Kiviter process''' is an above ground retorting technology for [[shale oil extraction]].

==History==
The Kiviter process is based on the earlier vertical retort technology (Pintsch's generator).&lt;ref name=vali/&gt;  This technology underwent a long process of development. The early concept of central inlet of the heat carrier was later replaced by a concept of heat carrier gas cross flow in the retort.&lt;ref name=koel/&gt;

The Kiviter technology has been used in Estonia since 1921, when first experimental Kiviter retorts were built.&lt;ref name=vali&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;   To supply heat, gases (including produced [[oil shale gas]]) and [[carbonaceous]] [[Spent shale|spent residue]] are burnt within the retort. Raw oil shale is fed into the top of the retort, and is heated by the rising gases, which pass laterally through the descending oil shale causing decomposition of the rock. Pyrolysis is completed in the lower section of the retort, where the spent shale contacted with more hot gas, steam and air is heated to about {{convert|900|°C|°F}} to gasify and burn the residual carbon ([[char]]).  [[Shale oil]] vapors and evolving gases are delivered to a condensing system, where condensed shale oil is collected, while non-condensable gases are fed back to the retort. Recycled gas enters the bottom of the retort and cools the spent shale, which then leaves the retort through a water-sealed discharge system.&lt;ref name=koel&gt;

'''Knockdown Texture''' is a [[drywall]] finishing style.  It is a mottled texture, more intense than a simple flat finish, but less intense than [[Orange peel (effect)|orange peel]], or [[Popcorn ceiling|popcorn]], texture.
[[Image:Knockdown texture.jpg|right|thumb|Heavy knockdown applied with a spray hopper.]]
Knockdown texture is created by watering down [[joint compound]] to a soupy consistency.  A [[trowel]] is then used to apply the joint compound.  The joint compound will begin to form [[stalactite]]s as it dries.  The trowel is then run over the surface of the drywall, knocking off the stalactites and leaving the mottled finish.

A much more common, and faster technique is to apply the texture mud (which is slightly different from joint compound, in that it has less shrinkage upon drying) with a texture machine – a compressor which sprays mud instead of paint. This applies what is referred to as a splatter coat. The use of a compressor allows this to be applied to walls as well as ceilings. When knocking this down, the mud is allowed to dry for a short period, then skimmed with a knockdown knife – a large, usually plastic (to reduce noticeable edges) knife.

Knockdown texture reduces construction costs because it conceals imperfections in the drywall that normally require higher more expensive stages of sand and prime for drywall installers.

Production of Labelflash media was halted on December 22, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labelflash.jp/jp/news.html|title=News|last=|first=|date=2016-12-22|website=The Official Website of Labelflash™|publisher=Yamaha, Inc|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20170224152915/http://labelflash.jp/jp/news.html|archive-date=2017-02-24|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labelflash was officially discontinued in 2017.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Technical details ==
In Labelflash, the standard recording head of an optical drive is repurposed to burn images onto a layer of dye made for this purpose on the top of proprietary Labelflash optical media.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kubo|first=Hiroshi|last2=Shibata|first2=Michihiro|last3=et|first3=al|displayauthors=2|date=June 2007|title=New Laser Labeling Technology for Recordable Digital Versatile Disc|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239054916_New_Laser_Labeling_Technology_for_Recordable_Digital_Versatile_Disc|journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|volume=46|pages=3926-3927|doi=10.1143/JJAP.46.3926|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dye is 0.6mm below the surface so as to protect it from the elements.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.belightsoft.com/products/resources/lightscribe-vs-labelflash|title=LightScribe VS.

The [[Display resolution|resolution]] is adjustable between 300 and 1800 dpi (dots per inch). Up to 256 monochromatic shades can be used in the image.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"[http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A141256966/GPS?sid=wikipedia Integrator Trade Only - Hardware - DVD rewriter - NEC ND4551.

Accessed 12 Nov. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The labeling process takes 7 minutes at the lowest resolution and a half hour at the highest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Labelflash is [[backwards compatible]] with Yamaha's earlier [[DiscT@2]] technology—this allows Labelflash-compatible optical drives to engrave onto the data side of discs as well.

According to Yamaha, a new iteration of Labelflash which supported four color printing was in the works&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;—however, as Labelflash support was discontinued in 2017,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; this never came to fruition.  

== Reception ==
The technology is often compared with [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[LightScribe]], released one year earlier. After its release, Labelflash was not available in the United States until 2007,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"[http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A164944722/GPS?sid=wikipedia Fujifilm Rolls Out Labelflash DVD Media to U.S. Market]" ''Wireless News'', 13 June 2007. ''General OneFile''. Accessed 12 Nov. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; giving HP a three year head start in the US market. Furthermore, worldwide, proprietary Labelflash optical media costed double that of comparable LightScribe media,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; at US$2.40 per disc,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/labelflash-lightscribe-dvd,1219.html|title=Labelflash vs LightScribe DVD/CD Labeling|last=Moersch|first=Siggy|date=2006-02-14|work=Tom's Hardware|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; which ''[[Tom's Hardware]]'' called an "exorbitant" price that made printing "painful" as test prints were not worth doing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Commenting on the price, ''[[Engadget]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Marc Perton said he'd "stick with [his] [[Sharpie (marker)|Sharpie]] for now."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/02/14/labelflash-vs-lightscribe-toms-goes-for-the-burn/|title=LabelFlash vs. LightScribe: Tom&amp;#039;s goes for the burn|last=Perton|first=Marc|date=2006-02-14|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers, such as Gordon Laing for [[Personal Computer World|''Personal Computer World'']], also noted that when compared to LightScribe, Labelflash images looked more "unnatural" and less "vibrant".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.org/details/Personal_Computer_World_2006-05_VNU_Business_Publications_GB/page/n117?q=labelflash|title=Add style with flash labels|last=Laing|first=Gordon|date=2006-05-01|work=Personal Computer World|access-date=2018-11-12|pages=51, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MonumentConquerorsSpace00.jpeg|thumb|Monument to the Conquerors of Space]]
The '''''Monument to the Conquerors of Space''''' ({{lang-rus|Монуме́нт «Покори́телям ко́смоса»|r=Monumént "Pokorítelyam kósmosa"|p=mənʊˈmʲent pəkɐrʲˈitʲɪlʲɪm ˈkosməsə}}) was erected in [[Moscow]] in 1964 to celebrate achievements of the [[Soviet people]] in space exploration. It depicts a starting rocket that rises on its exhaust plume. The monument is 107 meters (351 feet) tall, has 77° incline, and is made of [[titanium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ru/M329 |title=Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics website |publisher=Museum.ru |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics]] is located inside the base of the monument.

==Location and surroundings==

The monument is located outside the main entry to today's [[VDNKh (Russia)|Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy]] (''VDNKh''), in the northeastern part of Moscow, near Prospekt Mira ("Peace Avenue"). The easiest access is from the [[VDNKh (Metro)|VDNKh subway station]].

Since the 1960s, this part of Moscow in general has had a high concentration of space-themed sights and names: besides the monument and the museum under it, the grand "Cosmos" pavilion in the Exhibition Centre displayed many artifacts of the [[Soviet space program]]. Many streets in the area have been named after the precursors of the space program ([[Nikolai Kibalchich]], [[Friedrich Zander]], [[Yuri Kondratyuk]]) and its participants ([[Sergey Korolyov]]).

The [[Cosmonauts Alley]] south of the monument features [[bust (sculpture)|busts]] of Soviet cosmonauts.

The choice of this part of Moscow for space-related names and monuments may have been inspired by the fact that Prospekt Mira runs toward the north-eastern suburbs of Moscow, where, in [[Korolyov (city)|Podlipki]]
(today's Korolyov City) much of the space program was based. [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolyov]] himself lived in a house within a few blocks from the monument, which is now preserved as Korolyov Memorial Museum ({{lang-ru|Дом-музей академика С.&amp;nbsp;П.&amp;nbsp;Королёва}}).

==History==

In March 1958, a few months after the launch of ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', a competition was announced for the best design of an obelisk celebrating the dawn of the [[Space Age]]. Out of some 350 proposals, the design by [[sculptor]] [[A.P. Faidysh-Krandievsky]] and architects [[A.N. Kolchin]] and [[M.O. Barshch]] was chosen. The grand opening of the monument took place on October 4, 1964, on the day of the 7th anniversary of the ''Sputnik 1'' launch.

The monument was designed to accommodate a museum in its base. However, it took until April 10, 1981 (two days before the 20th anniversary of [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight) to complete the
preparatory work and open the [[Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics]]. The museum reopened on April 12, 2009 after three years of renovations.

==Design and sculpture==
[[File:Monumentos a los Conquistadores del Espacio 04.JPG|thumbnail|right|Front of the stone base]]
The main part of the monument is a giant [[obelisk]] topped by a rocket and resembling in shape the exhaust plume of the rocket. It is 107 meters (350&amp;nbsp;feet) tall and, on Korolyov's suggestion, covered with [[titanium]] cladding.

A statue of [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], the precursor of astronautics, is located in front of the obelisk.

A poem in Russian on the front of the stone base of the monument base says:
{{quotation|И наши тем награждены усилья,&lt;br /&gt;
Что поборов бесправие и тьму,&lt;br /&gt;
Мы отковали пламенные крылья&lt;br /&gt;
:Своей
::Стране
:::И веку своему!}}

Approximate translation:
{{quotation|And our efforts are rewarded,&lt;br /&gt;
we have overcome powerlessness and darkness, &lt;br /&gt;
We've forged these flaming wings.&lt;br /&gt;
:For our
::Nation
:::And this age of ours!}}

Below, in smaller letters, is the dedicatory statement:
"В ознаменование выдающихся достижений советского народа в освоении космического пространства сооружен этот монумент" ("This monument was constructed to celebrate the outstanding achievements of the Soviet people in space exploration"), and the year, 1964.

Both sides of the monument base, in their front parts, are decorated with [[high relief|haut-]] and [[bas-reliefs]] depicting men and women of the [[Soviet space program|space program]]: 
scientists, engineers, workers, their occupations indicated by appropriate accoutrements of the professions. Notable figures include a [[computer programmer]] (or perhaps some other computing or telecommunications professional) holding a [[punched tape]], a [[cosmonaut]] wearing a space suit, and [[Laika]] the space dog, first animal to orbit Earth.

No contemporary Soviet politicians are depicted in the monument either (that would violate the convention existing in the post-[[Joseph Stalin]] [[Soviet Union]] against commemorating living persons in this fashion), but the crowd on the right side of the monument are moving forward under the banner of [[Vladimir Lenin]].

==The monument reflected in other media==
The ''Monument to the Conquerors of Space'' is featured on the 1967 ten-[[Soviet Ruble|kopeck]] piece, one of the series of the [[Commemorative coins of the Soviet Union|commemorative coins]] issued to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]]. This coin has the distinction of being the smallest-denomination commemorative coin ever minted in the Soviet Union. (It was the smallest coin in the 1967 series—the only time commemorative fractional currency coins were ever produced in the USSR. All later commemorative coins were either 1 [[ruble]], or a higher denomination).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Monument is also featured in the music video "[[Go West (song)|Go West]]" by [[Pet Shop Boys]].

Also monument featured in the music video "[[Sweet Lullaby (song)|Sweet Lullaby]]" by [[Deep Forest]].

The monument is depicted on the home kit for the [[Russia national football team]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] on the front of the shirts in different shades of maroon.

==Replicas==
[[File:Боровск КЭЦ.JPG|thumb|right|Tsiolkovsky monument in Borovsk]]
The monument to [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] in downtown [[Borovsk]], designed by Sergey Bychkov, contains a nearly exact scale replica of the ''Conquerors of Space'' "rocket needle" and a whimsical statue of Tsiolkovsky gazing into the skies (and wearing [[valenki]] boots). It was unveiled in 2007. A copy of this statue (but not the "rocket needle") is installed at the [[Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium]]. A copy is also exhibited in the park of the United Nations Office in Geneva, a gift donated by the USSR and designed by the architect Alexander Koltchin and sculptor Yuri Neroda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600581D0E/(httpPages)/1CF0E20D6BC97A1680256EF700594A1C?OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Myriam Thyes was born in Luxembourg and grew up in [[Zürich]]. After getting certificate of higher education entrance, she studied at Hoehere Schule für Gestaltung Zurich, now ZHdK [[Zurich University of the Arts]], Switzerland. 1986 to 1992, the artist studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Düsseldorf, [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]], painting with Professor Rissa, and video art with Professor [[Nan Hoover]]. She received a degree 'Meisterschueler' from [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]]. Since 1994, Thyes participates in exhibitions and festivals internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duesseldorf.de/kuenstlerleben/index.php?p=suche/kuenstlerleben/bildende_kuenstler/detail&amp;id=454&amp;ref=liste&amp;page=1&amp;Name=T duesseldorf.de Retrieved 21 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=videokunst.ch&gt;http://www.videokunst.ch/index.asp?Inhalt=kuenstler.asp&amp;Id=713&amp;Md=1&amp;Stufe=0 videokunst.ch Retrieved 21 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999, main artistic media of Myriam Thyes are video art, 2D computer animation, photography, and digital imagery. From beginning of 2000 she initiates and realizes as well participatory projects and media art projects in public space. She co-founded artist group '''Strictly Public''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pixels and Places – Video Art in Public Space|year=2010|publisher=NAi Publishers|location=Rotterdam|pages=5, 27, 56, 61, 134, 147, 148|isbn=978-90-5662-738-6|author=Catrien Schreuder}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were invited to participate at Berlin media art festival transmediale.04. Already in 2000 and 2001, Strictly Public showed video art at 9 metro stations in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany), and 2002 in 26 main stations of the federal railroad all over Germany. Among Thyes's video art works in these programs was 'A little Meditation', the animation of the yin yang symbol, shown for example on the big screen at Frankfurt/Main central station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pixels and Places – Video Art in Public Space|year=2010|publisher=NAi Publishers|location=Rotterdam|pages=55, 56, 61, 121, 122, 147|isbn=978-90-5662-738-6|author=Catrien Schreuder}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strictlypublic.org/projekte/bahn-db-2002/index.html] artworks! - video art at the Deutsche Bahn in 26 central stations in Germany, Sep. - Nov. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LA Freewaves]]: Video art could be seen on monitors in stores and on billboards on Sunset Boulevard at the then new media festival 2004 in Los Angeles under artistic director Anne Bray. Cathrien Schreuder: "Myriam Thyes's work '''A Little Meditation''' on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood is a good example. In order to maintain its own form, her animated yin-yang symbol 'fights against the influences of commerce, and in doing so wrests a place for itself in the streetscape. Employing a universal idiom, Thyes visualizes the imbalance within the force field of oublic space. (...) The fact that the work is a good supplement to the streetscape on which it has been shown, including the screens in the train stations of Düsseldorf, the Victory Park Screens in Dallas &lt;ref&gt;[[Victory Park, Dallas]]&lt;/ref&gt; and various screens in Bern, Bosnia, Melbourne, Manchester &lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Big Screen]] Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; and Dublin." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pixels and Places – Video Art in Public Space|year=2010|publisher=NAi Publishers|location=Rotterdam|page=55,147,121|isbn=978-90-5662-738-6|author=Catrien Schreuder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thyes' themes deal with symbols, myths and visual signs from architecture, politics, movies, and religions, but as well mythical characters from Hollywood movies, and female characters form different cultures and epochs.&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;{{cite book|title=Re-Imagining Animation: The Changing Face of the Moving Image|year=2008|publisher=AVA Academia|location=Lausanne|pages=63–67|isbn=2940373698|author=Paul Wells, Johnny Hardstaff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thyes is represented by the media art foundation '[[Imai – inter media art institute]]' (Germany) and videokunst.ch (Switzerland).

One of her best known works – frequently shown in exhibitions and festivals internationally – is the participatory animation project '''Flag Metamorphoses'''.&lt;ref name="Catrien Schreuder 2010 56"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pixels and Places – Video Art in Public Space|year=2010|publisher=NAi Publishers|location=Rotterdam|page=56|isbn=978-90-5662-738-6|author=Catrien Schreuder}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mediatektur|year=2010|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Wien New York|pages=178–179|isbn=978-3-7091-0302-9|author=Christoph Kronhagel}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started in 2005 a continuously growing series of Flash animations concerning flags, other national symbols, and relations between countries. It's a work about relations between nations and identities: each artist who creates a flag animation expresses such a relation in his or her own way. So far, the series contains 40 animations by 30 international artists and teams. All animations together include about 100 different nations. Professor Paul Wells about Flag Metamorphoses in his book ''Re-Imagining Animation'': "Thyes's work is a very particular response to what she describes a very human 'double wish' to have both an individual identity and yet belong to a bigger group, often represented through nations, which are themselves 'imagined communities'. On her choice of flags as iconic Stimuli, Thyes recognises that their symbolism often endures beyond the actual conditions a nation lives through, sometimes remaining largely aspirational (...) Working in such a direct and politicised way, Thyes saw the opportunity to embrace both a democratic approach to the creation of work responsive to a core theme while engaging with other artists, but also in relation to its dissemination to a global audience on the World Wide Web. (...) Inevitably, this level of engagement prompts differing approaches and levels of interrogation. The political level looks at relationships between neighbouring countries, colonial ties and cultural imperialism. On the other hand, the artistic level examines the collapse and revision of largely geometric forms into more amorphous, organic and fluid configurations. (...) Thyes recognised that the key concept of changing cultures was readily revealed through the use of animation's core language of metamorphosis, and in the way animation could reveal and yet challenge the dense meanings embedded in national image systems. (...) Conceptually, Thyes felt that the best results might be achieved if the metamorphoses themselves took place within a single frame: 'What I have in mind is generally one changing image, not a film with scenes and cuts.' (...) This use of the formalist limits of the frame, while addressing the conditions of transition and meaning within it, reflects Thyes's background and identity as a visual artist. The particular influence of Russian Constructivism and the work of the Bauhaus movement are reflected in her collage technique and political satire." &lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;  
In the 1990s, she had worked with real flags as installations in public areas: She created and painted new designs and symbols on flags and hung them beside and between official flags in Dusseldorf and Luxembourg.

Thyes participated in the ''Art Colony Galichnik'' in Macedonia in Summer 2010. Artists and curators from various Balkan countries worked together. Thyes asked her subjects to answer in their mother tongues (Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian, Macedonian, Bulgarian and Albanian) and then subtitled their replies into English. She created a collage of images and voices in a two-channel video installation, called '''From Art Colony Galichnik with love (Macedonia 2010)'''. "Thyes documents the thoughts of her subjects and combines their words with shots of the countryside. She creates a sensitive picture of the different personalities and characters, partly by matching the two sets of images. The shots of landscapes and towns depict the origins of the person speaking or emphasise the content of what is being said. Thyes, who has Swiss and Luxembourgian roots, puts the individual at the heart of her work. In doing so, she teils a story of the human needs that exist together at a specific point and place in time - and that, ultimately, reflect the needs that people experience at any time and anywhere in the world." &lt;ref&gt;Katrin Weber, cite catalogue: Ostrale'013 - we cross the Rubicon. 2013. Dresden&lt;/ref&gt;

The series of photos and photomontages '''Glasgow Styles'''&lt;ref&gt;http://davis-museum-artblog.blogspot.de/2012/01/myriam-thyes-glasgow-styles-magnify.html&lt;/ref&gt; reflect the artist's impressions of the post-industrial city of Glasgow and her inhabitants. Thyes has drawn a social portrait and created a kind of contemporary "Historienbilder" (historical paintings). Michael Staab in ''The Whole Picture. Second Take'' about this work: "... Now, in her series entitled Glasgow Styles, Myriam Thyes takes the consistent next step, and combines the realistic, serial and documentary potential of photography with the formative, allegorising and metaphor-creating traditions of the fine arts. She compiles individual snapshots into sequences that make lapses of time and changes of perspective visible, and also mounts photographs taken at geographically differing locations and at staggered points in time into altogether new pictorial inventions. The citizens of Glasgow, some of them mounted into the original pictures, happened to be at other locations in the same town at the time the pictures were taken. Thus the right people are in the pictures, only, as stated above, at a different place and at another time. The divergence thus highlighted between space, time and individual remains tangible in Thyes’s works, and conveys to the viewer a profound sense of the mood of the people in this city. ..." &lt;ref name=Staab&gt;{{cite book|title=Myriam Thyes – Glasgow Styles / Magnify Malta by Kunstverein Duisburg|year=2012|publisher=Kehrer Artbooks|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-86828-276-4|author=Michael Staab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Dickson, director of Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow, in his text ''Glasgow Styles'': "Myriam Thyes's series Glasgow Styles delineates how Glasgow as a contemporary city reflects its past through the present. Initially what seems like a random visual derive is coherently held together through a detailed narrative that the artist has perceptively encountered and which helps to inform Thyes' personal topography of our city. This topography is the city's changing face – a place historically and contemporaneously of contrasts and tensions." &lt;ref name=Dickson&gt;{{cite book|title=Myriam Thyes – Glasgow Styles / Magnify Malta by Kunstverein Duisburg|year=2012|publisher=Kehrer Artbooks|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-86828-276-4|author=Malcolm Dickson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Animal Resource Facility for Biomedical Research''' formerly the '''National Center for Laboratory Animal Sciences''' is an Indian [[Biomedical research]] facility, and [[vivarium]] under the [[Indian Council of Medical Research]]. The new 33rd flagship institute of ICMR was founded in 2015, at [[Genome Valley]] in [[Hyderabad, India]].&lt;ref name="pib.nic.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=131632|title=Cabinet approves setting up of National Resource Facility for Bio-medical Research (NARF) at Genome Valley in Hyderabad|website=Pib.nic.in|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center is a state of the art Animal house and [[Animal science]]s facility located near [[Turkapally]], [[Shamirpet]] spread over 102 acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/nation/world-class-animal-breeding-facility-for-research-gets-nod.html|title=World-class animal breeding facility for research gets nod|website=Dailypioneer.com|accessdate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/facility-for-biomedical-research-at-genome-valley/article7898578.ece|title=Facility for bio-medical research at Genome Valley|author=|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute proposes to breed specific pathogen free animals such as [[mice]], [[rat]]s, [[hamster]]s, [[rabbit]], [[guinea pig]]s, [[mini pig]]s, [[caninae|canines]], [[swine]], [[equine]]s, [[horse]]s, [[sheep]], and [[goat]]s. Various species of non-human [[primates]] such as bonnet monkey, cynomolgus monkey, pig tail monkey, owl monkey and squirrel monkey among others needed for research purpose. By tenth year of its functioning, the institute proposes to breed SPF quality animals. Though the project was conceived way back in 2002 in the previous Government, it got delayed due to financial and technical reasons. However, it got impetus in 2015.&lt;ref name="pib.nic.in"/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:ICMR - NIN - NCLAS.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad|National Center for Laboratory Animal Sciences, Hyderabad]]]]
On 18 November 2015 the union Government of India, approved a long-pending proposal envisaging Rs 338.58 crore-world-class-facility for breeding beagle dogs, horses, and monkeys besides other animals on a large scale to indigenously to meet the needs of the country’s pharma firms for drug testing and clinical research. Subsequently, The National Center For Laboratory Animal Sciences at the [[National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad]] is being integrated to form the National Animal Resource Facility for Biomedical Research.&lt;ref name="pib.nic.in"/&gt;

==History==
"The need for the NARF-BR has been consistently felt as the existing institutes like  [[Central Drug Research Institute]], Lucknow and [[National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad]] are working on small animals, mostly rodents. They cannot meet the demand and requirement of biomedical sector, which has no option but to depend on countries like Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia for testing their products," said a senior official from the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]]. Sharing the cabinet decision with reporters after the cabinet meeting, Manoj Pant, Joint Secretary of Department of Health Research in the Ministry, "The institute is expected to cut down research cost by 60 per cent and consequently drugs and vaccine by about 30 per cent in the long run."
For instance, while presently research cost in US and China is around Rs 2 crore for 180 days, similar tests for same duration at NARBF will cost just Rs 51 lakhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmr.nic.in/About_Us/ICMR_Achievements.html|title=Indian Council of Medical Research|website=Icmr.in|accessdate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/centre-okays-resource-facility-for-bio-medical-research-1244964|title=Centre Okays Resource Facility for Bio-Medical Research|date=18 November 2015|work=NDTV.com|accessdate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3080">The '''National Border Targeting Centre''' (NBTC) is a division and site of the [[Border Force]] in the UK, that collates and processes data from people entering and leaving the UK. It is the information-processing site that keeps track of migration into the UK. It operates 24 hours a day.

==History==
It was opened on Thursday 11 March 2010 by the [[UK Border Agency]] (UKBA). The e-Borders systems had been launched in May 2009, with Project Semaphore running as a prototype from 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3700232.stm Project Semaphore]&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the Joint Border Operations Centre (JBOC) at Heathrow, a much smaller site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icinspector.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/An-Inspection-of-eborders.pdf Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The site is run by the [[Home Office]]. It has around 200 staff in [[Wythenshawe]], Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/e-borders-snares-2-800-criminals-at-the-border Visit in April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the Intelligence, Targeting and Watchlisting Command within the Border Force.

==Function==
Passengers on flights [[Border control|entering and leaving]] the UK are screened by the NBTC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3374999/Almost-300-suspected-terrorists-criminals-illegal-migrants-trying-cross-UK-border-DAY.html Daily Mail December 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The airlines pass data ([[passenger name record]], or PNR) of each passenger to the NBTC, including date of birth. The NBTC tracks former flights taken by each individual going back up to a decade, and determines whether an individual's flight history could be suspicious. Each individual is checked against criminal record databases. Exit checks are conducted at Ferry Ports connecting to European Ports by the ferry operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.doverport.co.uk/about/news/introduction-of-government-imposed-exit-checks-at/12953/|title=- Port of Dover|website=www.doverport.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It looks at the [[e-Borders]] Semaphore system for suspects. It looks mainly for rapists and murderers and pirates. It tracks around 250 million passenger movements per year. It has no defence against false [[passport]]s. It operates the Pre-Departure Checks Scheme.

The '''Open Mashup Alliance''' ('''OMA''') is a non-profit [[consortium]] that promotes the adoption of mashup solutions in the enterprise through the evolution of enterprise mashup standards like  [[Enterprise Mashup Markup Language|EMML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Mashup Alliance FAQs |url=http://www.openmashup.org/faq}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enterprise mashup usage is expected to grow tenfold in the next five years.{{when|see WP:RELTIME|date=December 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enterprise mashup market to increase tenfold over next five years |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=2942}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial members of the OMA include some large technology companies such as [[Adobe Systems]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], and some major technology users such as [[Bank of America]] and [[Capgemini]].

According to information technology industry analyst Dion Hinchcliffe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating a unified model for enterprise mashups |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=872}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ultimately, the OMA creates a standardized approach to enterprise mashups that creates an open and vibrant market for competing runtimes, mashups, and an array of important aftermarket services such as development/testing tools, management and administration appliances, [[Governance Frameworks|governance frameworks]], education, professional services, and so on."

==Specification development==
The initial focus of the OMA is developing [[Enterprise Mashup Markup Language|EMML]], which is a declarative mashup [[domain-specific language]] (DSL) aimed at creating enterprise mashups.

The EMML language provides a comprehensive set of high-level mashup-domain vocabulary to consume and mash variety of Web data-sources in diverse ways. EMML provides a uniform syntax to invoke heterogeneous service styles: [[REST]], [[WSDL]], [[RSS]]/[[ATOM]], [[RDBMS]], and [[POJO]]. EMML also provides ability to mix and match diverse data-formats: [[XML]], [[JSON]], [[JDBC]], JavaObjects, and primitive types.

The OMA Web site provides the EMML specification,&lt;ref name="OMA Download Agreement Page"&gt;{{cite web | title = OMA Download Agreement Page | url = http://www.openmashup.org/download/agreement.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the EMML schema,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EMML Schema | url = http://www.openmashup.org/schemas/v1.0/EMMLSpec.xsd}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference runtime implementation capable of running EMML scripts,&lt;ref name="OMA Download Agreement Page"/&gt; sample EMML mashup scripts,&lt;ref name="OMA Download Agreement Page"/&gt; and technical documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EMML Technical Documentation | url = http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OMA is developing EMML under a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution No Derivatives license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OMA FAQs | url = http://www.openmashup.org/faq/#3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The license means that EMML users are allowed copy and distribute EMML. However, EMML can not be altered by users and the ownership of EMML by the OMA must be made clear in any redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Creative Commons Attribution No Derivatives License Overview | url = https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eventual objective of the OMA is to submit the EMML specification and any other OMA specifications to a recognized industry standards body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Enterprise mashup proponents start organizing | url = http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=2972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PEARL''', or '''Process and experiment automation realtime language''', is a [[computer]] [[programming language]] designed for [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] and [[real-time computing|real-time]] programming. Being a [[high-level language]], it is fairly [[cross-platform]]. Since 1977, the language has been going under several standardization steps by the [[Deutsches Institut für Normung]]. The current version is PEARL-90, which was standardized in 1998 as DIN 66253-2.

PEARL is not to be confused with the similarly named [[Perl]], an entirely unrelated programming language created by [[Larry Wall]] in 1987.

==Features==

PEARL supports both [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] numeric values, character and character [[String (computer science)|string]] data as well as bit values. It also provides facilities for structures and multi-dimensional [[Array data structure|arrays]]. Both typed and untyped pointers are also supported, along with typecasting. Due to existence of this language, Wall discovered the existing PEARL programming language before Perl's official release and changed the spelling of the name. 

PEARL is a higher programming language, which allows a comfortable, secure and almost processor independent programming of multitasking- and realtime problems and has been standardized since 1977 at various stages of its development, the last time 1998 as PEARL-90 (DIN 66253-2 1998, Berlin, Beuth-Verlag, 1998).

Besides the simple possibility to map process technical problems, an important principle at the development of PEARL was the easy learning by the programmer.

All basic data types and language structures of other procedural programming languages exist in PEARL. In addition PEARL offers comfortable language elements for the handling of multitasking- and realtime tasks.

Like most other high-level languages, PEARL supports [[Subroutine|procedures]] and functions, and passing parameters to these can be done by value or by reference (via [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75410">{{short description|control loop feedback mechanism}}
A '''proportional–integral–derivative controller''' ('''PID controller''' or '''three-term controller''') is a [[control loop]] [[feedback mechanism]] widely used in [[industrial control system]]s and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an ''error value'' &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] (SP) and a measured [[process variable]] (PV) and applies a correction based on [[Proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms (denoted ''P'', ''I'', and ''D'' respectively), hence the name.

In practical terms it automatically applies accurate and responsive correction to a control function. An everyday example is the [[cruise control]] on a car, where external influences such as hills (gradients) would decrease speed. The PID algorithm restores from current speed to the desired speed in an optimal way, without delay or overshoot, by controlling the power output of the vehicle's engine. 

The first theoretical analysis and practical application was in the field of automatic steering systems for ships, developed from the early 1920s onwards. It was then used for automatic process control in manufacturing industry, where it was widely implemented in pneumatic, and then electronic, [[Controller (control theory)|controllers]]. Today there is universal use of the PID concept in applications requiring accurate and optimised automatic control.

==Fundamental operation==
[[File:PID en.svg|thumb|400x400px|A [[block diagram]] of a PID controller in a feedback loop. ''r''(''t'') is the desired process value or setpoint (SP), and ''y''(''t'') is the measured process value (PV).]] 
The distinguishing feature of the PID controller is the ability to use the three ''control terms'' of proportional, integral and derivative influence on the controller output to apply accurate and optimal control. The block diagram on the right shows the principles of how these terms are generated and applied. It shows a PID controller, which continuously calculates an ''error value'' &lt;math&gt;e(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the difference between a desired [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]]&lt;math&gt;\text{SP} = r(t)&lt;/math&gt; and a measured [[process variable]] &lt;math&gt;\text{PV} = y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and applies a correction based on [[proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms. The controller attempts to minimize the error over time by adjustment of a ''control variable'' &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;, such as the opening of a [[control valve]], to a new value determined by a [[weighted sum]] of the control terms.

In this model:
* Term '''P''' is proportional to the current value of the SP − PV error ''e''(''t''). For example, if the error is large and positive, the control output will be proportionately large and positive, taking into account the gain factor "K". Using proportional control alone in a process with compensation such as temperature control, will result in an error between the setpoint and the actual process value, because it requires an error to generate the proportional response. If there is no error, there is no corrective response.
* Term '''I''' accounts for past values of the SP − PV error and integrates them over time to produce the ''I'' term. For example, if there is a residual SP − PV error after the application of proportional control, the integral term seeks to eliminate the residual error by adding a control effect due to the historic cumulative value of the error. When the error is eliminated, the integral term will cease to grow. This will result in the proportional effect diminishing as the error decreases, but this is compensated for by the growing integral effect.
* Term '''D''' is a best estimate of the future trend of the SP − PV error, based on its current rate of change. It is sometimes called "anticipatory control", as it is effectively seeking to reduce the effect of the SP − PV error by exerting a control influence generated by the rate of error change. The more rapid the change, the greater the controlling or dampening effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eolss.net/ebooks/Sample%20Chapters/C18/E6-43-03-03.pdf | title = PID Control | last = Araki | first = M. | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Tuning''' – The balance of these effects is achieved by "loop tuning" (see later) to produce the optimal control function. The tuning constants are shown below as "K" and must be derived for each control application, as they depend on the response characteristics of the complete loop external to the controller. These are dependent on the behaviour of the measuring sensor, the final control element (such as a control valve), any control signal delays and the process itself. Approximate values of constants can usually be initially entered knowing the type of application, but they are normally refined, or tuned, by "bumping" the process in practice by introducing a setpoint change and observing the system response. 

'''Control action''' – The mathematical model and practical loop above both use a "direct" control action for all the terms, which means an increasing positive error results in an increasing positive control output for the summed terms to apply correction. However, the output is called "reverse" acting if it is necessary to apply negative corrective action. For instance, if the valve in the flow loop was 100–0% valve opening for 0–100% control output – meaning that the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this reverse action. An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the [[fail-safe]] mode, in the case of loss of signal, would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% controller output needs to cause 100% valve opening.

===Mathematical form===
The overall control function can be expressed mathematically as
:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = K_\text{p} e(t) + K_\text{i} \int_0^t e(t') \,dt' + K_\text{d} \frac{de(t)}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;K_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt;, all non-negative, denote the coefficients for the [[proportional control|proportional]], [[integral]], and [[derivative]] terms respectively (sometimes denoted ''P'', ''I'', and ''D'').

In the ''standard form'' of the equation (see later in article), &lt;math&gt;K_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt; are respectively replaced by &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p}/T_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p} T_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt;; the advantage of this being that &lt;math&gt;T_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt; have some understandable physical meaning, as they represent the integration time and the derivative time respectively.

===Selective use of control terms===
Although a PID controller has three control terms, some applications use only one or two terms to provide the appropriate control. This is achieved by setting the unused parameters to zero and is called a PI, PD, P or I controller in the absence of the other control actions. PI controllers are fairly common, since derivative action is sensitive to measurement noise, whereas the absence of an integral term may prevent the system from reaching its target value.

===Applicability===
The use of the PID algorithm does not guarantee [[optimal control]] of the system or its [[Nyquist stability criterion|control stability]] {{See below |Limitations of PID control}}. Situations may occur where there are excessive delays: the measurement of the process value is delayed, or the control action does not apply quickly enough.  In these cases [[Lead–lag compensator|lead–lag compensation]] is required to be effective. The response of the controller can be described in terms of its responsiveness to an error, the degree to which the system [[overshoot (signal)|overshoots]] a setpoint, and the degree of any system oscillation. But the PID controller is broadly applicable, since it relies only on the response of the measured process variable, not on knowledge or a model of the underlying process.

==History==
[[File:Scross helmsman.jpg|thumb|Early PID theory was developed by observing the actions of [[helmsmen]] in keeping a vessel on course in the face of varying influences such as wind and sea state.]]
[[File:Pneumatische regelaar.jpg|thumb|Pneumatic PID (Three term) controller. The magnitude of the "three terms" P, I and D are adjusted by the dials at the top.]]
===Origins===
Continuous control, before PID controllers were fully understood and implemented, has one of its origins in the [[centrifugal governor]] which uses rotating weights to control a process. This had been invented by [[Christian Huygens]] in the 17th century to regulate the gap between [[millstone]]s in [[windmill]]s depending on the speed of rotation, and thereby compensate for the variable speed of grain feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hills|first=Richard L|title=Power From the Wind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Adaptive Control Processes: A Guided Tour |author=Richard E. Bellman |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=December 8, 2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwbWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22Centrifugal+Governor%22+Huygens&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq8cC3uaHPAhWCmBoKHR2OCqwQ6AEIPjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Centrifugal%20Governor%22%20Huygens&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the invention of the low-pressure, stationary steam engine there was a need for automatic speed control, and [[James Watt]]’s self-designed, "conical pendulum" governor, a set of revolving steel balls attached to a vertical spindle by link arms, came to be an industry standard. This was based on the mill stone gap control concept.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt;

Rotating governor speed control, however, was still variable under conditions of varying load, where the shortcoming of what is now known as proportional control alone was evident. The error between the desired speed and the actual speed would increase with increasing load. In the 19th century the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1868 in his now-famous paper ''On Governors''. He explored the mathematical basis for control stability, and progressed a good way towards a solution, but made an appeal for mathematicians to examine the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Maxwell |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell |title=On Governors |date=1868 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=100 |issue= |pages= |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/On_Governors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt;  The problem was examined further by [[Edward Routh]] in 1874, [[Jacques Charles François Sturm|Charles Sturm]] and in 1895, [[Adolf Hurwitz]], who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt;
In practice, speed governors were further refined, notably by American scientist [[Willard Gibbs]], who in 1872 theoretically analysed Watt’s conical pendulum governor.

About this time, the invention of the [[Whitehead torpedo]] posed a control problem which required accurate control of the running depth. Use of a depth pressure sensor alone proved inadequate, and a pendulum which measured the fore and aft pitch of the torpedo was combined with depth measurement to become the [[pendulum-and-hydrostat control]]. Pressure control provided only a proportional control which, if the control gain was too high, would become unstable and go into overshoot, with considerable instability of depth-holding. The pendulum added what is now known as derivative control, which damped the oscillations by detecting the torpedo dive/climb angle and thereby the rate of change of depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newpower |first=Anthony |title=Iron Men and Tin Fish: The Race to Build a Better Torpedo during World War II |publisher=Praeger Security International |year=2006 |isbn=0-275-99032-X}} p.&amp;nbsp; citing {{citation |first=Edwyn |last=Gray |title=The Devil's Device: Robert Whitehead and the History of the Torpedo |location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute |date=1991 |page=33 |ref=none}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This development (named by Whitehead as  "The Secret" to give no clue to its action) was around 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sleeman |first=C.

Another early example of a PID-type  controller was developed by [[Elmer Sperry]] in 1911 for ship-steering, though his work was intuitive rather than mathematically-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html |title=A Brief Building Automation History |accessdate=2011-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708104028/http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1922, however, that a formal control law for what we now call PID or three-term control was first developed using theoretical analysis, by [[Russian American]] engineer [[Nicolas Minorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Minorsky |title=Directional stability of automatically steered bodies |journal=J. Amer. Soc.

He noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error, but also on past error, as well as the current rate of change;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|loc = [https://books.google.com/books?id=VD_b81J3yFoC&amp;pg=PA67 p. 67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was then given a mathematical treatment by Minorsky.&lt;ref name="ben96"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His goal was stability, not general control, which simplified the problem significantly. While proportional control provided stability against small disturbances, it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance, notably a stiff gale (due to [[#Steady-state error|steady-state error]]), which required adding the integral term. Finally, the derivative term was added to improve stability and control.

Trials were carried out on the [[USS New Mexico (BB-40)|USS ''New Mexico'']], with the controllers controlling the ''[[angular velocity]]'' (not angle) of the rudder. PI control yielded sustained yaw (angular error) of ±2°. Adding the D element yielded a yaw error of ±1/6°, better than most helmsmen could achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Navy ultimately did not adopt the system due to resistance by personnel. Similar work was carried out and published by several others in the 1930s.

===Industrial control===
[[File:Nozzle and flapper proportional controller.png|thumb|Proportional control using nozzle and flapper high gain amplifier and negative feedback]]
The wide use of feedback controllers did not become feasible until the development of wide band high-gain amplifiers to use the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by [[Harold Black]] in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt; Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the [[nozzle and flapper]] high-gain pneumatic amplifier, which had been invented in 1914, with negative feedback from the controller output. This dramatically increased the linear range of operation of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added by the use of a precision bleed valve and a bellows generating the Integral term. The result was the "Stabilog" controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows.&lt;ref name="ben96"/&gt; Later the derivative term was added by a further bellows and adjustable orifice. 

From about 1932 onwards, the use of wideband pneumatic controllers increased rapidly in a variety of control applications. Compressed air was used both for generating the controller output, and for powering the process modulating device; such as a diaphragm operated [[control valve]].  They were simple low maintenance devices which operate well in a harsh industrial environment, and did not present an explosion risk in [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous locations]]. They were the industry standard for many decades until the advent of discrete electronic controllers and [[distributed control system]]s.

With these controllers, a pneumatic industry signalling standard of {{cvt|3|-|15|psi|bar|1}} was established, which had an elevated zero to ensure devices were working within their linear characteristic and represented the control range of 0-100%.

In the 1950s, when high gain electronic amplifiers became cheap and reliable, electronic PID controllers became popular, and 4–20 mA [[current loop]] signals were used which emulated the pneumatic standard. However field actuators still widely use the pneumatic standard because of the advantages of pneumatic motive power for [[control valves]] in process plant environments.
[[File:Analogue control loop evolution.png|thumb|Showing the evolution of analogue control loop signalling from the pneumatic to the electronic eras.]]
[[File:Smart current loop positioner.png|thumb|Current loops used for sensing and control signals. A modern electronic "smart" [[control valve|valve positioner]] is shown, which will incorporate its own PID controller.]]

Most modern PID controls in industry are implemented in [[distributed control system]]s (DCS), [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs), computer-based controllers or as a [[compact controller]]. Software implementations have the advantages that they are relatively cheap and flexible with respect to the implementation of the PID algorithm in a particular control scenario.

===Electronic analogue controllers===
Electronic analog PID control loops were often found within more complex electronic systems, for example, the head positioning of a [[disk drive]], the power conditioning of a [[power supply]], or even the movement-detection circuit of a modern [[seismometer]]. Discrete electronic analogue controllers have been largely replaced by digital controllers using [[microcontrollers]] or [[FPGA]]s to implement PID algorithms. However, discrete analog PID controllers are still used in niche applications requiring high-bandwidth and low-noise performance, such as laser-diode controllers.&lt;ref name="Toptica"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.toptica.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Articles_Application_Notes/toptica_AP_1012_laser_locking_2012.pdf|last = Neuhaus|first = Rudolf|authorlink = |title = Diode Laser Locking and Linewidth Narrowing|work = |accessdate = June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control loop example==
{{Further information|Control system}}
Let's take the example of a [[robotic arm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ee.hacettepe.edu.tr/~solen/ELE356/exp1.pdf|title=Position control system|publisher=Hacettepe University Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;, that can be moved and positioned by a control loop. An [[electric motor]] may lift or lower the arm, depending on forward or reverse power applied, but power cannot be a simple function of position because of the [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] of the arm, forces due to gravity, external forces on the arm such as a load to lift or work to be done on an external object.
* The sensed position is the [[process variable]] (PV).
* The desired position is called the setpoint (SP).
* The difference between the PV and SP is the error (e), which quantifies whether the arm is too low or too high and by how much.
* The input to the process (the [[electric current]] in the motor) is the output from the PID controller. It is called either the manipulated variable (MV) or the control variable (CV).

By measuring the position (PV), and subtracting it from the setpoint (SP), the error (e) is found, and from it the controller calculates how much electric current to supply to the motor (MV).

===Proportional===
The obvious method is '''proportional''' control: the motor current is set in proportion to the existing error. However, this method fails if, for instance, the arm has to lift different weights: a greater weight needs a greater force applied for a same error on the down side, but a smaller force if the error is on the upside. That's where the integral and derivative terms play their part.

===Integral===
An '''integral''' term increases action in relation not only to the error but also the time for which it has persisted. So, if applied force is not enough to bring the error to zero, this force will be increased as time passes. A pure "I" controller could bring the error to zero, however, it would be both slow reacting at the start (because action would be small at the beginning, needing time to get significant) and brutal (the action increases as long as the error is positive, even if the error has started to approach zero).

===Derivative===
A '''derivative''' term does not consider the error (meaning it cannot bring it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint), but the rate of change of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping the force applied, and so reduces overshoot (error on the other side because too great applied force). Applying too much impetus when the error is small and decreasing will lead to overshoot. After overshooting, if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite direction and repeatedly overshoot the desired position, the output would [[oscillate]] around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or decaying [[sine wave|sinusoid]]. If the amplitude of the oscillations increase with time, the system is unstable. If they decrease, the system is stable. If the oscillations remain at a constant magnitude, the system is [[marginal stability|marginally stable]].

===Control damping===
In the interest of achieving a controlled arrival at the desired position (SP) in a timely and accurate way, the controlled system needs to be [[critically damped]]. A well-tuned position control system will also apply the necessary currents to the controlled motor so that the arm pushes and pulls as necessary to resist external forces trying to move it away from the required position. The setpoint itself may be generated by an external system, such as a [[programmable logic controller|PLC]] or other computer system, so that it continuously varies depending on the work that the robotic arm is expected to do. A well-tuned PID control system will enable the arm to meet these changing requirements to the best of its capabilities.

===Response to disturbances===
If a controller starts from a stable state with zero error (PV = SP), then further changes by the controller will be in response to changes in other measured or unmeasured inputs to the process that affect the process, and hence the PV. Variables that affect the process other than the MV are known as disturbances. Generally controllers are used to reject disturbances and to implement setpoint changes. A change in load on the arm constitutes a disturbance to the robot arm control process.

===Applications===
In theory, a controller can be used to control any process which has a measurable output (PV), a known ideal value for that output (SP) and an input to the process (MV) that will affect the relevant PV. Controllers are used in industry to regulate [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[force]], [[feed rate]],&lt;ref name="Kebriaei et. al. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kebriaei|first=Reza|author2=Frischkorn, Jan |author3=Reese, Stefanie |author4=Husmann, Tobias |author5=Meier, Horst |author6=Moll, Heiko |author7= Theisen, Werner |title=Numerical modelling of powder metallurgical coatings on ring-shaped parts integrated with ring rolling|journal=Material Processing Technology|volume=213|issue=1|pages=2015–2032|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Volumetric flow rate|flow rate]], chemical composition (component [[concentration]]s), [[weight]], [[position (vector)|position]], [[speed]], and practically every other variable for which a measurement exists.

==PID controller theory==
:''This section describes the parallel or non-interacting form of the PID controller. For other forms please see the section [[#Alternative nomenclature and PID forms|Alternative nomenclature and PID forms]].''

The PID control scheme is named after its three correcting terms, whose sum constitutes the manipulated variable (MV). The proportional, integral, and derivative terms are summed to calculate the output of the PID controller. Defining &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; as the controller output, the final form of the PID algorithm is
:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = \mathrm{MV}(t) = K_\text{p} e(t) + K_\text{i} \int_0^t e(\tau) \,d\tau + K_\text{d} \frac{de(t)}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt;K_\text{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the proportional gain, a tuning parameter,
: &lt;math&gt;K_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the integral gain, a tuning parameter,
: &lt;math&gt;K_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative gain, a tuning parameter,
: &lt;math&gt;e(t) = \mathrm{SP} - \mathrm{PV}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the error (SP is the setpoint, and PV(''t'') is the process variable),
: &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time or instantaneous time (the present),
: &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the variable of integration (takes on values from time 0 to the present &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;).

Equivalently, the transfer function in the [[Laplace transform|Laplace domain]] of the PID controller is
:&lt;math&gt;L(s) = K_\text{p} + K_\text{i}/s + K_\text{d} s,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the complex frequency.

===Proportional term===
[[File:PID varyingP.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Response of PV to step change of SP vs time, for three values of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; held constant)]]

The proportional term produces an output value that is proportional to the current error value. The proportional response can be adjusted by multiplying the error by a constant ''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, called the proportional gain constant.

The proportional term is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = K_\text{p} e(t).&lt;/math&gt;

A high proportional gain results in a large change in the output for a given change in the error. If the proportional gain is too high, the system can become unstable (see [[#Loop tuning|the section on loop tuning]]). In contrast, a small gain results in a small output response to a large input error, and a less responsive or less sensitive controller. If the proportional gain is too low, the control action may be too small when responding to system disturbances. Tuning theory and industrial practice indicate that the proportional term should contribute the bulk of the output change.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Steady-state error====

Because a non-zero error is required to drive it, a proportional controller generally operates with a so-called ''steady-state error''.{{efn|The only exception is where the target value is the same as the value obtained when the proportional gain is equal to zero.}} Steady-state error (SSE) is proportional to the process gain and inversely proportional to proportional gain. SSE may be mitigated by adding a compensating [[biasing|bias term]] to the setpoint AND output, or corrected dynamically by adding an integral term.

===Integral term===
[[File:Change with Ki.png|right|thumb|320px|Response of PV to step change of SP vs time, for three values of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; held constant)]]

The contribution from the integral term is proportional to both the magnitude of the error and the duration of the error. The [[integral]] in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then multiplied by the integral gain (''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) and added to the controller output.

The integral term is given by
:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{out} = K_\text{i} \int_0^t e(\tau) \,d\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral term accelerates the movement of the process towards setpoint and eliminates the residual steady-state error that occurs with a pure proportional controller. However, since the integral term responds to accumulated errors from the past, it can cause the present value to [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] the setpoint value (see [[#Loop tuning|the section on loop tuning]]).

===Derivative term===
[[File:Change with Kd.png|right|thumb|320px|Response of PV to step change of SP vs time, for three values of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; (''K''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; held constant)]]

The derivative of the process error is calculated by determining the slope of the error over time and multiplying this rate of change by the derivative gain ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;. The magnitude of the contribution of the derivative term to the overall control action is termed the derivative gain, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

The derivative term is given by
:&lt;math&gt;D_\text{out} = K_\text{d} \frac{de(t)}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

Derivative action predicts system behavior and thus improves settling time and stability of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=Introduction&amp;section=ControlPID |title=Introduction: PID Controller Design |publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=PID without a PhD |url=http://igor.chudov.com/manuals/Servo-Tuning/PID-without-a-PhD.pdf |publisher=EE Times-India |date=October 2000 |author=Tim Wescott}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ideal derivative is not [[causal system|causal]], so that implementations of PID controllers include an additional low-pass filtering for the derivative term to limit the high-frequency gain and noise. Derivative action is seldom used in practice though – by one estimate in only 25% of deployed controllers {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} – because of its variable impact on system stability in real-world applications.

==Loop tuning==
''Tuning'' a control loop is the adjustment of its control parameters (proportional band/gain, integral gain/reset, derivative gain/rate) to the optimum values for the desired control response. Stability (no unbounded oscillation) is a basic requirement, but beyond that, different systems have different behavior, different applications have different requirements, and requirements may conflict with one another.

PID tuning is a difficult problem, even though there are only three parameters and in principle is simple to describe, because it must satisfy complex criteria within the [[#Limitations of PID control|limitations of PID control]]. There are accordingly various methods for loop tuning, and more sophisticated techniques are the subject of patents; this section describes some traditional manual methods for loop tuning.

Designing and tuning a PID controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. PID controllers often provide acceptable control using default tunings, but performance can generally be improved by careful tuning, and performance may be unacceptable with poor tuning. Usually, initial designs need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired.

Some processes have a degree of [[nonlinear system|nonlinearity]] and so parameters that work well at full-load conditions don't work when the process is starting up from no-load; this can be corrected by [[gain scheduling]] (using different parameters in different operating regions).

===Stability===

If the PID controller parameters (the gains of the proportional, integral and derivative terms) are chosen incorrectly, the controlled process input can be unstable, i.e., its output [[divergence (computer science)|diverges]], with or without [[oscillation]], and is limited only by saturation or mechanical breakage. Instability is caused by ''excess'' gain, particularly in the presence of significant lag.

Generally, stabilization of response is required and the process must not oscillate for any combination of process conditions and setpoints, though sometimes [[marginal stability]] (bounded oscillation) is acceptable or desired.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Mathematically, the origins of instability can be seen in the Laplace domain.&lt;ref name=Bechhoefer&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bechhoefer | first = John | title = Feedback for Physicists: A Tutorial Essay On Control | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 783–835 | publisher = APS Physics | url = http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.77.783 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.77.783| citeseerx = 10.1.1.124.7043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total loop transfer function is:
:&lt;math&gt;H(s)=\frac{K(s)G(s)}{1+K(s)G(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;K(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the PID transfer function and
:&lt;math&gt;G(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the plant transfer function

The system is called unstable where the closed loop transfer function diverges for some &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Bechhoefer"/&gt; This happens for situations where &lt;math&gt;K(s)G(s)=-1&lt;/math&gt;. Typically, this happens when &lt;math&gt;|K(s)G(s)|=1&lt;/math&gt; with a 180 degree phase shift. Stability is guaranteed when &lt;math&gt;K(s)G(s)&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; for frequencies that suffer high phase shifts. A more general formalism of this effect is known as the [[Nyquist stability criterion]].

===Optimal behavior===
The optimal behavior on a process change or setpoint change varies depending on the application.

Two basic requirements are ''regulation'' (disturbance rejection&amp;nbsp;– staying at a given setpoint) and ''command tracking'' (implementing setpoint changes)&amp;nbsp;– these refer to how well the controlled variable tracks the desired value. Specific criteria for command tracking include [[rise time]] and [[settling time]]. Some processes must not allow an overshoot of the process variable beyond the setpoint if, for example, this would be unsafe. Other processes must minimize the energy expended in reaching a new setpoint.

===Overview of tuning methods===
There are several methods for tuning a PID loop. The most effective methods generally involve the development of some form of process model, then choosing P, I, and D based on the dynamic model parameters. Manual tuning methods can be relatively time consuming, particularly for systems with long loop times.

The choice of method will depend largely on whether or not the loop can be taken "offline" for tuning, and on the response time of the system. If the system can be taken offline, the best tuning method often involves subjecting the system to a step change in input, measuring the output as a function of time, and using this response to determine the control parameters. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Manual tuning===
If the system must remain online, one tuning method is to first set &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; values to zero. Increase the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; until the output of the loop oscillates, then the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; should be set to approximately half of that value for a "quarter amplitude decay" type response. Then increase &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; until any offset is corrected in sufficient time for the process. However, too much &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; will cause instability. Finally, increase &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt;, if required, until the loop is acceptably quick to reach its reference after a load disturbance. However, too much &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; will cause excessive response and overshoot. A fast PID loop tuning usually overshoots slightly to reach the setpoint more quickly; however, some systems cannot accept overshoot, in which case an [[overdamped]] closed-loop system is required, which will require a &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; setting significantly less than half that of the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; setting that was causing oscillation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Ziegler–Nichols method===
{{Details|Ziegler–Nichols method}}

Another heuristic tuning method is formally known as the [[Ziegler–Nichols method]], introduced by [[John G. Ziegler]] and [[Nathaniel B. Nichols]] in the 1940s. As in the method above, the &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; gains are first set to zero. The proportional gain is increased until it reaches the ultimate gain, &lt;math&gt;K_u&lt;/math&gt;, at which the output of the loop starts to oscillate. &lt;math&gt;K_u&lt;/math&gt; and the oscillation period &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt; are used to set the gains as follows:

| &lt;math&gt;3{K_u}{T_u}/40&lt;/math&gt;
|}

These gains apply to the ideal, parallel form of the PID controller. When applied to the standard PID form, only the integral and derivative time parameters &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_d&lt;/math&gt; are dependent on the oscillation period &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt;. Please see the section "[[#Alternative nomenclature and PID forms|Alternative nomenclature and PID forms]]".

===Cohen–Coon parameters===
This method was developed in 1953 and is based on a first-order + time delay model. Similar to the [[Ziegler–Nichols method]], a set of tuning parameters were developed to yield a closed-loop response with a decay ratio of 1/4. Arguably the biggest problem with these parameters is that a small change in the process parameters could potentially cause a closed-loop system to become unstable

===Relay (Åström–Hägglund) method===
Published in 1984 by [[Karl Johan Åström]] and Tore Hägglund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.controleng.com/search/search-single-display/relay-method-automates-pid-loop-tuning/4a5774decc.html |title=Relay Method Automates PID Loop Tuning |first=Vance |last=VanDoren |journal=Control Engineering |date=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relay method temporarily operates the process using [[bang-bang control]] and measures the resultant oscillations.  The output is switched (as if by a [[relay]], hence the name) between two values of the control variable.  The values must be chosen so the process will cross the setpoint, but need not be 0% and 100%; by choosing suitable values, dangerous oscillations can be avoided.

As long as the process variable is below the setpoint, the control output is set to the higher value.  As soon as it rises above the setpoint, the control output is set to the lower value.  Ideally, the output waveform is nearly square, spending equal time above and below the setpoint.  The period and amplitude of the resultant oscillations are measured, and used to compute the ultimate gain and period, which are then fed into the Ziegler–Nichols method.

Specifically, the ultimate period &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be equal to the observed period, and the ultimate gain is computed as &lt;math&gt;K_u = 4b/\pi a,&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|a}} is the amplitude of the process variable oscillation, and {{mvar|b}} is the amplitude of the control output change which caused it.

There are numerous variants on the relay method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Review of Relay Auto-tuning Methods for the Tuning of PID-type Controllers |first=Stephen |last=Hornsey |journal=Reinvention |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=29 October 2012 |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/reinvention/issues/volume5issue2/hornsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PID tuning software===
Most modern industrial facilities no longer tune loops using the manual calculation methods shown above. Instead, PID tuning and loop optimization software are used to ensure consistent results. These software packages will gather the data, develop process models, and suggest optimal tuning. Some software packages can even develop tuning by gathering data from reference changes.

Mathematical PID loop tuning induces an impulse in the system, and then uses the controlled system's frequency response to design the PID loop values. In loops with response times of several minutes, mathematical loop tuning is recommended, because trial and error can take days just to find a stable set of loop values. Optimal values are harder to find. Some digital loop controllers offer a self-tuning feature in which very small setpoint changes are sent to the process, allowing the controller itself to calculate optimal tuning values.

Other formulas are available to tune the loop according to different performance criteria. Many patented formulas are now embedded within PID tuning software and hardware modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Yun |last1=Li |first2=Kiam Heong |last2=Ang |first3=Gregory C.Y. |last3=Chong |title=Patents, software, and hardware for PID control: An overview and analysis of the current art |journal=IEEE Control Systems Magazine |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=42–54 |date=February 2006 |url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3816/1/IEEE2pdf.pdf |doi=10.1109/MCS.2006.1580153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in automated PID loop tuning software also deliver algorithms for tuning PID Loops in a dynamic or non-steady state (NSS) scenario. The software will model the dynamics of a process, through a disturbance, and calculate PID control parameters in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |title=On Automation of the PID Tuning Procedure |first=Kristian |last=Soltesz |publisher=[[Lund university]] |date=January 2012 |type=[[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] theis |url=http://www.control.lth.se/documents/2012/sol2012lic.pdf |id=[http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/2293573 847ca38e-93e8-4188-b3d5-8ec6c23f2132]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations of PID control==
While PID controllers are applicable to many control problems, and often perform satisfactorily without any improvements or only coarse tuning, they can perform poorly in some applications, and do not in general provide [[optimal control|''optimal'' control]]. The fundamental difficulty with PID control is that it is a feedback control system, with ''constant'' parameters, and no direct knowledge of the process, and thus overall performance is reactive and a compromise. While PID control is the best controller in an [[state observer|observer]] without a model of the process, better performance can be obtained by overtly modeling the actor of the process without resorting to an observer.

PID controllers, when used alone, can give poor performance when the PID loop gains must be reduced so that the control system does not overshoot, oscillate or [[hunting oscillation|hunt]] about the control setpoint value. They also have difficulties in the presence of non-linearities, may trade-off regulation versus response time, do not react to changing process behavior (say, the process changes after it has warmed up), and have lag in responding to large disturbances.

The most significant improvement is to incorporate [[feed-forward control]] with knowledge about the system, and using the PID only to control error. Alternatively, PIDs can be modified in more minor ways, such as by changing the parameters (either [[gain scheduling]] in different use cases or adaptively modifying them based on performance), improving measurement (higher sampling rate, precision, and accuracy, and low-pass filtering if necessary), or cascading multiple PID controllers.

===Linearity===
Another problem faced with PID controllers is that they are linear, and in particular symmetric. Thus, performance of PID controllers in non-linear systems (such as [[HVAC control system|HVAC systems]]) is variable. For example, in temperature control, a common use case is active heating (via a heating element) but passive cooling (heating off, but no cooling), so overshoot can only be corrected slowly – it cannot be forced downward. In this case the PID should be tuned to be overdamped, to prevent or reduce overshoot, though this reduces performance (it increases settling time).

===Noise in derivative===

A problem with the derivative term is that it amplifies higher frequency measurement or process [[noise]] that can cause large amounts of change in the output. It is often helpful to filter the measurements with a [[low-pass filter]] in order to remove higher-frequency noise components. As low-pass filtering and derivative control can cancel each other out, the amount of filtering is limited. So low noise instrumentation can be important. A nonlinear [[median filter]] may be used, which improves the filtering efficiency and practical performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3815/1/IEEE_CS_PID_01580152.pdf Li, Y. and Ang, K.H. and Chong, G.C.Y. (2006) PID control system analysis and design - Problems, remedies, and future directions]. IEEE Control Systems Magazine, 26 (1). pp. 32-41. {{ISSN|0272-1708}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the differential band can be turned off with little loss of control. This is equivalent to using the PID controller as a [[#PI controller|PI controller]].

==Modifications to the PID algorithm==
The basic PID algorithm presents some challenges in control applications that have been addressed by minor modifications to the PID form.

===Integral windup===
{{Details|Integral windup}}

One common problem resulting from the ideal PID implementations is [[integral windup]]. Following a large change in setpoint the integral term can accumulate an error larger than the maximal value for the regulation variable (windup), thus the system overshoots and continues to increase until this accumulated error is unwound. This problem can be addressed by:

*Disabling the integration until the PV has entered the controllable region
*Preventing the integral term from accumulating above or below pre-determined bounds
*Back-calculating the integral term to constrain the regulator output within feasible bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controlguru.com/2008/021008.html|last=Cooper|first=Douglas|title=Integral (Reset) Windup, Jacketing Logic and the Velocity PI Form|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overshooting from known disturbances===
For example, a PID loop is used to control the temperature of an electric resistance furnace where the system has stabilized. Now when the door is opened and something cold is put into the furnace the temperature drops below the setpoint. The integral function of the controller tends to compensate for error by introducing another error in the positive direction. This overshoot can be avoided by freezing of the integral function after the opening of the door for the time the control loop typically needs to reheat the furnace.

===PI controller===
[[File:PI controller.svg|thumb|300x300px|Basic block of a PI controller]]&lt;!--redirects link here--&gt;

A '''PI Controller''' (proportional-integral controller) is a special case of the PID controller in which the derivative (D) of the error is not used.

The controller output is given by
:&lt;math&gt;K_P \Delta + K_I \int \Delta\,dt&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the error or deviation of actual measured value ('''''PV''''') from the setpoint ('''''SP''''').
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta = SP - PV.&lt;/math&gt;

A PI controller can be modelled easily in software such as [[Simulink]] or [[Xcos]] using a "flow chart" box involving [[Laplace transform|Laplace]] operators:
:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{G(1+\tau s)}{\tau s}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;G = K_P&lt;/math&gt; = proportional gain
:&lt;math&gt;\frac G \tau = K_I&lt;/math&gt; = integral gain

Setting a value for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is often a trade off between decreasing overshoot and increasing settling time.

The lack of derivative action may make the system more steady in the steady state in the case of noisy data. This is because derivative action is more sensitive to higher-frequency terms in the inputs.

Without derivative action, a PI-controlled system is less responsive to real (non-noise) and relatively fast alterations in state and so the system will be slower to reach setpoint and slower to respond to perturbations than a well-tuned PID system may be.

===Deadband===
Many PID loops control a mechanical device (for example, a valve). Mechanical maintenance can be a major cost and wear leads to control degradation in the form of either [[stiction]] or [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] in the mechanical response to an input signal. The rate of mechanical wear is mainly a function of how often a device is activated to make a change. Where wear is a significant concern, the PID loop may have an output [[deadband]] to reduce the frequency of activation of the output (valve). This is accomplished by modifying the controller to hold its output steady if the change would be small (within the defined deadband range). The calculated output must leave the deadband before the actual output will change.

===Setpoint step change===
The proportional and derivative terms can produce excessive movement in the output when a system is subjected to an instantaneous step increase in the error, such as a large setpoint change. In the case of the derivative term, this is due to taking the derivative of the error, which is very large in the case of an instantaneous step change. As a result, some PID algorithms incorporate some of the following modifications:

;Setpoint ramping
:In this modification, the setpoint is gradually moved from its old value to a newly specified value using a linear or first order differential ramp function. This avoids the [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]] present in a simple step change.
;Derivative of the process variable
:In this case the PID controller measures the derivative of the measured [[process variable]] (PV), rather than the derivative of the error. This quantity is always continuous (i.e., never has a step change as a result of changed setpoint). This modification is a simple case of setpoint weighting.
;Setpoint weighting
:Setpoint weighting adds adjustable factors (usually between 0 and 1) to the setpoint in the error in the proportional and derivative element of the controller. The error in the integral term must be the true control error to avoid steady-state control errors. These two extra parameters do not affect the response to load disturbances and measurement noise and can be tuned to improve the controller's setpoint response.

===Feed-forward===

The control system performance can be improved by combining the [[feedback]] (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with [[feed forward (control)|feed-forward]] (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or ''error'' remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can be based on the setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.

For example, in most motion control systems, in order to accelerate a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller is being used to control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.

===Bumpless operation===
PID controllers are often implemented with a "bumpless" initialization feature that recalculates the integral accumulator term to maintain a consistent process output through parameter changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controlguru.com/wp/p71.html|last=Cooper|first=Douglas|title=PI Control of the Heat Exchanger|work=Practical Process Control by Control Guru|accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partial implementation is to store the integral of the integral gain times the error rather than storing the integral of the error and postmultiplying by the integral gain, which prevents discontinuous output when the I gain is changed, but not the P or D gains.

===Other improvements===

In addition to feed-forward, PID controllers are often enhanced through methods such as PID [[gain scheduling]] (changing parameters in different operating conditions), [[fuzzy logic]], or [ftp://www.cc.uah.es/pub/Alumnos/G_Ing_Informatica/Comp_Flexible/Articulos/CI.pdf computational verb logic].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Yang | first= T.|title= Architectures of Computational Verb Controllers: Towards a New Paradigm of Intelligent Control | journal= International Journal of Computational Cognition | volume= 3 | issue= 2 | pages= 74–101 | publisher= Yang's Scientific Press |date= June 2005 | ref= harv | url=  http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.152.9564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Liang| first= Y.-L.()|title= Controlling fuel annealer using computational verb PID controllers | journal= Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Anti-Counterfeiting, security, and identification in communication |pages= 417–420 | publisher= [[IEEE]] | year= 2009 | url=  http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1719210&amp;preflayout=tabs | ref= harv | display-authors= 1 | author2= &lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further practical application issues can arise from instrumentation connected to the controller. A high enough sampling rate, measurement precision, and measurement accuracy are required to achieve adequate control performance. Another new method for improvement of PID controller is to increase the degree of freedom by using [[fractional calculus#PID controllers|fractional order]]. The order of the integrator and differentiator add increased flexibility to the controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tenreiro Machado JA, et al | title = Some Applications of Fractional Calculus in Engineering | journal = Mathematical Problems in Engineering | volume = 2010 | date = 2009 | doi = 10.1155/2010/639801 | url = https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2010/639801/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cascade control==
One distinctive advantage of PID controllers is that two PID controllers can be used together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers.{{Vague|date=February 2009}}.

For example, a temperature-controlled circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, each with its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.

The proportional, integral, and differential terms of the two controllers will be very different. The outer PID controller has a long time constant – all the water in the tank needs to heat up or cool down. The inner loop responds much more quickly. Each controller can be tuned to match the physics of the system ''it'' controls – heat transfer and thermal mass of the whole tank or of just the heater – giving better total response.

==Alternative nomenclature and PID forms==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

===Ideal (standard) versus parallel PID form===
The form of the PID controller most often encountered in industry, and the one most relevant to tuning algorithms is the ''standard form''. In this form the &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; gain is applied to the &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;D_{\mathrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt; terms, yielding:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = K_p \left( e(t) + \frac{1}{T_i}\int_0^t e(\tau)\,d\tau + T_d\frac{d}{dt}e(t) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''integral time''
:&lt;math&gt;T_d&lt;/math&gt; is the ''derivative time''

In this standard form, the parameters have a clear physical meaning. In particular, the inner summation produces a new single error value which is compensated for future and past errors. The proportional error term is the current error. The derivative components term attempts to predict the error value at &lt;math&gt;T_d&lt;/math&gt; seconds (or samples) in the future, assuming that the loop control remains unchanged. The integral component adjusts the error value to compensate for the sum of all past errors, with the intention of completely eliminating them in &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; seconds (or samples). The resulting compensated single error value is then scaled by the single gain &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; to compute the control variable.

In the parallel form, shown in the controller theory section
:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_0^t e(\tau)\,d\tau + K_d\frac{d}{dt}e(t)&lt;/math&gt;

the gain parameters are related to the parameters of the standard form through &lt;math&gt;K_i = K_p/T_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_d = K_p T_d&lt;/math&gt;. This parallel form, where the parameters are treated as simple gains, is the most general and flexible form. However, it is also the form where the parameters have the least physical interpretation and is generally reserved for theoretical treatment of the PID controller. The standard form, despite being slightly more complex mathematically, is more common in industry.

===Reciprocal gain, a.k.a. proportional band===
In many cases, the manipulated variable output by the PID controller is a dimensionless fraction between 0 and 100% of some maximum possible value, and the translation into real units (such as pumping rate or watts of heater power) is outside the PID controller. The process variable, however, is in dimensioned units such as temperature. It is common in this case to express the gain &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; not as "output per degree", but rather in the reciprocal form of a ''proportional band'' &lt;math&gt;100/K_p&lt;/math&gt;, which is "degrees per full output": the range over which the output changes from 0 to 1 (0% to 100%).  Beyond this range, the output is saturated, full-off or full-on.  The narrower this band, the higher the proportional gain.

===Basing derivative action on PV===
In most commercial control systems, derivative action is based on process variable rather than error. That is, a change in the setpoint does not affect the derivative action.  This is because the digitized version of the algorithm produces a large unwanted spike when the setpoint is changed. If the setpoint is constant then changes in the PV will be the same as changes in error. Therefore, this modification makes no difference to the way the controller responds to process disturbances.

===Basing proportional action on PV===
Most commercial control systems offer the ''option'' of also basing the proportional action solely on the process variable. This means that only the integral action responds to changes in the setpoint. The modification to the algorithm does not affect the way the controller responds to process disturbances.
Basing proportional action on PV eliminates the instant and possibly very large change in output caused by a sudden change to the setpoint. Depending on the process and tuning this may be beneficial to the response to a setpoint step.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{MV(t)}=K_p\left(\,{-PV(t)} + \frac{1}{T_i}\int_{0}^{t}{e(\tau)}\,{d\tau} - T_d\frac{d}{dt}PV(t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
King&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Myke |title=Process Control: A Practical Approach |publisher=Wiley |year=2011 |pages=52–78 |isbn=0-470-97587-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes an effective chart-based method.

===Laplace form of the PID controller===
Sometimes it is useful to write the PID regulator in [[Laplace transform]] form:
:&lt;math&gt;G(s)=K_p + \frac{K_i}{s} + K_d{s}=\frac{K_d{s^2} + K_p{s} + K_i}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

Having the PID controller written in Laplace form and having the [[transfer function]] of the controlled system makes it easy to determine the closed-loop transfer function of the system.

===Series/interacting form===
Another representation of the PID controller is the series, or ''interacting'' form
:&lt;math&gt;G(s) = K_c \frac{(\tau_i{s}+1)}{\tau_i{s}} (\tau_d{s}+1)&lt;/math&gt;
where the parameters are related to the parameters of the standard form through
:&lt;math&gt;K_p = K_c \cdot \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_i = \tau_i \cdot \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;T_d = \frac{\tau_d}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1 + \frac{\tau_d}{\tau_i}&lt;/math&gt;.

This form essentially consists of a PD and PI controller in series, and it made early (analog) controllers easier to build. When the controllers later became digital, many kept using the interacting form.

===Discrete implementation===
The analysis for designing a digital implementation of a PID controller in a [[microcontroller]] (MCU) or [[FPGA]] device requires the standard form of the PID controller to be ''discretized''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19070283/Discrete-PI-and-PID-Controller-Design-and-Analysis-for-Digital-Implementation |title=Discrete PI and PID Controller Design and Analysis for Digital Implementation |publisher=Scribd.com |accessdate=2011-04-04 |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximations for first-order derivatives are made by backward [[finite difference]]s. The integral term is discretised, with a sampling time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, as follows,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{t_k} e(\tau) \, d\tau = \sum_{i=1}^k e(t_i) \, \Delta t &lt;/math&gt;

The derivative term is approximated as,
:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{de(t_k)}{dt}=\dfrac{e(t_k)-e(t_{k-1})}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a ''velocity algorithm'' for implementation of the discretized PID controller in a MCU is obtained by differentiating &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;, using the numerical definitions of the first and second derivative and solving for &lt;math&gt;u(t_k)&lt;/math&gt; and finally obtaining:

:&lt;math&gt;u(t_k)=u(t_{k-1})+K_p\left[\left(1+\dfrac{\Delta t}{T_i}+\dfrac{T_d}{\Delta t}\right) e(t_k)+\left(-1-\dfrac{2T_d}{\Delta t}\right)e(t_{k-1}) + \dfrac{T_d}{\Delta t}e(t_{k-2})\right]&lt;/math&gt;

s.t. &lt;math&gt; T_i = K_p/K_i, T_d = K_d/K_p&lt;/math&gt;

==Pseudocode==

Here is a simple software loop that implements a PID algorithm:&lt;ref name="codeproject"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/36459/PID-process-control-a-Cruise-Control-example |title=PID process control, a "Cruise Control" example |publisher=CodeProject |accessdate=4 November 2012 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 previous_error = 0
 integral = 0
 loop:
   error = setpoint - measured_value
   integral = integral + error * dt
   derivative = (error - previous_error) / dt
   output = Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative
   previous_error = error
   wait(dt)
   goto loop
In this example, two variables that will be maintained within the loop are [[initialization (programming)|initialized]] to zero, then the loop begins. The current ''error'' is calculated by subtracting the ''measured_value'' (the process variable, or PV) from the current ''setpoint'' (SP). Then, ''[[integral]]'' and ''[[derivative]]'' values are calculated, and these and the ''error'' are combined with three preset gain terms – the proportional gain, the integral gain and the derivative gain – to derive an ''output'' value. 

In the real world, this is [[digital-to-analog converter|D-to-A converted]] and passed into the process under control as the manipulated variable (MV). The current error is stored elsewhere for re-use in the next differentiation, the program then waits until dt seconds have passed since start, and the loop begins again, [[analog-to-digital converter|reading in]] new values for the PV and the setpoint and calculating a new value for the error.&lt;ref name="codeproject"/&gt;

Note that for real code, the use of "wait(dt)" might be inappropriate because it doesn't account for time taken by the algorithm itself during the loop, or more importantly, any preemption delaying the algorithm.

{{commons category|Pastry bag}}
A '''pastry bag''' (or '''piping bag''' in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]) is an often [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]- or triangular-shaped, [[hand-held]]&lt;ref name=Feuer93&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feuer|first1=Janice|title=Fruit-sweet and sugar-free : prize-winning pies, cakes, pastries, muffins &amp; breads from the Ranch Kitchen Bakery|date=1993|publisher=Healing Arts Press|location=Rochester, Vt.|isbn=9780892814497|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J75v-GWCquwC&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; bag made from [[cloth]], [[paper bag|paper]], or [[plastic bag|plastic]] that is used to ''pipe'' semi-solid [[food]]s by pressing them through a narrow opening at one end, for many purposes including [[cake decorating|cake decoration]]. It is filled through a wider opening at the opposite end, rolled or twisted closed, and then squeezed to [[Food extrusion|extrude]] its contents.

Though a circular nozzle is quite useful for making round shapes and for filling pastries such as [[profiterole]]s, many differently shaped nozzles are commonly used to produce star, leaf, and flower-petal shapes.

Aside from [[icing (food)|icing]], pastry bags are commonly used to shape meringue and [[whipped cream]], and to fill [[doughnut]]s with [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jelly]] or [[custard]]. They are used to form [[cream puff]]s, [[Éclair (pastry)|éclair]]s, and [[Ladyfinger (biscuit)|ladyfingers]]. When presentation is especially important, fluted tips can be used to shape savory foods such as filling for [[deviled egg]]s, whipped [[butter]], and [[mashed potato]]es (especially for ''Pommes duchesse'').

A high-quality reusable bag is often made from tightly woven [[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[rubber]] or waterproofed (plastic-coated) [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=Maxfield2003&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maxfield|first1=Jaynie|title=Cake decorating for the first time|date=2003|publisher=Sterling Pub.|location=New York|isbn=9781402717239|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjpvC5jy_WkC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Poulos2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poulos|first1=Barbara Fairchild ; photography by Con|title=Bon appétit desserts the cookbook for all things sweet and wonderful|date=2010|publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub.|location=Kansas City, Mo.|isbn=9781449402006|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_Nz8PkYawYC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medium quality bags are similar, except they are not so tightly woven and may let some contents seep through the weave or the seams. After use, a reusable bag is washed by hand and hung open to dry.  A high-quality bag may last for many years.

Pastry bag users who do not have a dishwashing machine may prefer to use disposable bags, and thus avoid hand-washing messy bags.&lt;ref name=Ruhlman2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruhlman|first1=Michael|title=The Elements of Cooking: Translating the Chef's Craft for Every Kitchen|date=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781416579229|page=241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nb3ziIO-GEQC&amp;pg=PT241|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disposable bags are ready-made in inexpensive plastic. A plastic food storage bag is also commonly used as a pastry bag. For small quantities and fine piping, a pastry bag can be made by rolling cooking [[parchment]] or [[wax paper]] into a cone, filling it, folding the wide end several times to close it, and then cutting the tip into whatever shape is desired. This is especially useful for small quantities of melted [[chocolate]], since a very small hole can be cut and the bag can be discarded when it cools and becomes clogged.

Tips come in sets of interchangeable pieces;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valastro|first1=Buddy|title=Baking with the Cake Boss|date=2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781451628913|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blUJMyF7qMYC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; expensive tips can be purchased one at a time. They may be chrome-plated or [[stainless steel]], or plastic. Each tip is cone-shaped, with a base too large to fit through the small opening in the bag; they are to be inserted through the larger opening before food is spooned in. Tips can be used with pairs of adapter rings:  an inner ring is dropped inside the bag and pushed part way out the hole, a tip is slipped over the ring, then an outer ring is slipped over the tip and screwed onto the inner ring.  This permits the tip to be changed without emptying the bag. Some inexpensive sets are of disposable [[plastic]] film with a drop-in ring and screw-on plastic tips (see image above). Many foods (including frosting and pressurized "spray can" whipped cream) can be purchased in disposable packaging designed to serve the function of a pastry bag.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13804">[[File:Mid-1800s_abolitionist_pot-holder,_from_the_Smithsonian_Museum_of_American_History.jpg|thumb|A mid-1800s abolitionist pot-holder, from the Smithsonian Museum of American History]]A '''pot-holder''' is a piece of [[textile]] (often quilted) or [[silicone]] used to cover the hand when holding hot [[kitchen]] [[cooking]] equipment, like pots and [[frying pan|pan]]s. They are frequently made of [[polyester]] and/or [[cotton]]. Crocheted pot-holders can be made out of cotton [[yarn]] as a craft project/[[folk art]].
A pot-holder offers protection for only one hand at a time. To lift a pan with two hot handles using both hands, two pot-holders are needed. For holding a hot piece of equipment, the pot-holder is folded around it and grasped with the hand. Generally a rubber surface will be on one side to grip and a fabric side to absorb the heat on the other side.

When made of textile fabric, pot-holders typically have an inner layer of a material providing [[thermal insulation]] sandwiched between more colorful or decorative outsides. The most common type commercially available nowadays has the form of a square, with a side length varying from {{convert|5|in|cm}} to {{convert|10|in|cm}} and slightly rounded corners, and a textile loop at one of the corners for hanging.

== Cultural uses ==

Throughout the pot-holder's lifetime, it has also been used as a representative symbol of various cultural movements. During the United States [[Abolitionist Movement]], they were displayed by women who wanted to show their support for the Abolitionist cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Alice|title=Selling abolitionism: The commercial, material and social world of the Boston Antislavery Fair, 1834–1858|journal=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing,|date=2008|page=121|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/868678758?accountid=14551|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These provided women with some way to casually identify as part of the Abolitionist Movement without overtly expressing such. Additionally, it is sometimes used by [[Cajun]] cultures as part of their [[Mardi Gras]] masks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Carolyn|title=Anything to Act Crazy: Cajun Women and Mardi Gras Disguise|journal=Journal of American Folklore|date=1 March 2001|volume=114|issue=452|pages=225–247|doi=10.1353/jaf.2001.0009|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/14706|issn=1535-1882}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment of Japanese Americans during World War II]], the interred Japanese created several pot-holders out of various colored fabrics in order to reflect their own culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dusselier|first1=Jane|title=Artful identifications: Crafting survival in Japanese American concentration camps|journal=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|date=2005|pages=48–49|url=http://ida.lib.uidaho.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304991013?accountid=14551}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to break up the monotony, as the colorful nature of the crafts was in stark contrast to the generally bland surroundings of the camps.

== Style development ==

The earliest records of pot-holders in the United States stem from the early 1900s, when pot-holders were made out of lace, as well as crocheted and embroidered. The usage of lace fell away at the same time as the popularization of geometric patterns on pot-holders, lasting up until the late 1970s. At the same time, [[applique]] methods began to become popularly used around the 1960s, and remained the most popular method, alongside of [[quilting]] up through the 1970s to the present.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maines|first1=Rachel|title=Evolution of the Potholder: From Technology to Popular Art|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=June 1985|volume=19|issue=1|pages=3–34|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1985.00003.x|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229730419_Evolution_of_the_Potholder_From_Technology_to_Popular_Art|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials ==
The textile potholder was nonexistent in art or writing until around the 19th century. Evidence in art points towards hooks that were used to carry hot-handled pots in ancient Greece, but it wasn't until the [[Maria Weston Chapman|Antislavery Bazaars]] of the mid-19th century that equivocally the first home-made potholders were made. These crafts were illustrated with various designs and advertised the phrase 'Any holder but a Slave Holder." By creating such a political craft, which shares similar dimensions and fabrication with the contemporary potholder, women who may have never associated with the abolitionist movement had the opportunity to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lemire|first1=Beverly|title=The Force of Fashion in Politics and Society: Global Perspectives from Early Modern to Contemporary Times|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351889698|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaGoDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of potholders is concomitant with the rise in proliferation of magazines. In these magazines, patterns were given for 'teapot holders' which strongly resemble potholders. Insulation capability was limited in early models. Since their genesis as standard household items, potholders have been largely associated with [[crafts|home crafting]], and crocheting has long been the leading method in this strain followed by knitting and [[patchwork]].&lt;ref name="Social Science Research Network"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maines|first1=Rachel Pearl|title=The Evolution of the Potholder from Technology to Popular Art|date=1 June 1985|ssrn=2780107}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Needlework]] patterns in the 1950s were often impractical and over-designed with holes and elaborate spacing that would burn the user or wear out the holder quickly. In the 1970s, quilting and applique-made potholder patterns gained popularity, enduring into the present day.&lt;ref name="Social Science Research Network"/&gt;

== Safety ==
Pot-holders are a form of [[Personal Protective Equipment]] or PPE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michaels|first1=Barry|last2=Ayers|first2=Troy|last3=Birbari|first3=Wafa|title=Hygiene issues associated with food service potholders and oven mitts|journal=Food Service Technology|date=June 2002|volume=2|issue=2|pages=81–86|doi=10.1046/j.1471-5740.2002.00033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in kitchen settings to protect the kitchen staff from heat related injuries. However, one issue with having pot holders in commercial kitchens is that they are not sanitary. According to ''Food Service Technology 2.2'', research has shown that Pot-holders are one of the sole culprits of cross contamination in the kitchen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This occurs when someone in the kitchen is working with raw food and then uses a Pot-holder without proper sanitation. When the next person uses the Pot-holder, they are subject to all the germs left behind previously. Another issue with Pot-holders is that the materials that they are made out of are often not water resistant, making them impossible to wash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodgers|first1=Svetlana|title=Food safety research underpinning food service systems - a review|journal=Food Service Technology|date=June 2005|volume=5|issue=2-4|pages=67–76|doi=10.1111/j.1471-5740.2005.00113.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This poses a problem because kitchens are full of accidental spills, and if a pot-holder becomes soiled, there is no quick solution to cleaning it. If a pot holder becomes wet in any way, it becomes a [[steam burn]] risk. Because of these risks, Pot-holders have been banned from commercial kitchens in [[New Zealand]], but there is no sign of them doing so in the United States anytime soon.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Wool ==
Pot holders need to withstand temperatures over 400 degrees Fahrenheit to protect skin from hot dishes and make a potentially harmful task harmless. A common fabric used for pot-holders is [[wool]] because it can withstand very hot temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wonder of Wool: Ancient Fiber to Modern Marvel {{!}} American Textile History Museum|url=http://www.athm.org/museum_exhibition/wonder-of-wool-ancient-fiber-to-modern-marvel/|website=www.athm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What makes wool a unique product is that it is essentially flame resistant. The combination of sulfur and nitrogen provides a blend of materials that provide a flame-resistant product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alongi|first1=Jenny|last2=Horrocks|first2=Richard|last3=Carosio|first3=Richard|title=Update on Flame Retardant Textiles|date=2013|url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uidaho/detail.action?docID=1593499.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason wool is used for many types of heat protection is that it has a low ignition temperature. This is defined as the temperature in which an item will produce a flame. Wool can be heated to over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit before the igniting of this fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alongi|first1=Jenny|last2=Horrocks|first2=Richard|last3=Carosio|first3=Federico|title=Update on Flame Retardant Textiles|publisher=iSmithers Rapra|url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uidaho/detail.action?docID=1593499.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the fabric comes in contact with flames it does not disseminate the flame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kilinc|first1=Selcen|title=Handbook of Fire Resistant Textiles|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides an even greater protective quality with the wool's low ignition temperature and the inability for flames to spread throughout the fiber. When wool is heated to a certain degree, it begins to "char" on the outside. This can provide a protective outer layer on the outside fabric. When the char on the outside of the fabric is consistent with the original properties of the wool, it can produce a safer version of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alongi|first1=Jenny|last2=Horrocks|first2=Richard|last3=Carosio|first3=Federico|title=Update on Flame Retardant Textiles|date=2013|url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uidaho/detail.action?docID=1593499.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the heat is directly applied to the fabric, the "char" forms a semi-liquid state which can be wiped off the fabric providing no evidence of the heat contact.

== Home production ==
In the early days of "[[Do it yourself]]" and domestic craftwork, projects like quilting, sewing, knitting, and crocheting were used for both labor and leisure. These activities are commonly used methods to make pot-holders. Craftwork of this nature has often been associated with women and children as a tradition to be passed down from mother to daughter since before the eighteenth century. By the mid-eighteenth century, it was seen as the woman's duty to decorate and fill their home with these different types of homemaking crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=C|first=Edwards|date=2006|title=Home is Where the Art is: Women, Handicrafts, and Home Improvements 1750-1900|url=|journal=Journal of Design History|volume=19|pages=11–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pot-holders appeared as one of these crafts in the late nineteenth century, usually marketed to accompany [[kettle]]s and [[teapot]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Patterns to create pot-holders at home were first seen in the United States in pamphlets and magazines, including [[periodicals]] like ''Workbasket'', whose primary target audience consisted of the middle and working classes. This appearance of needlework patterns in magazines began around 1880 and continued to be prominent through the 1930s. During the [[Depression Era]], designs for potholders were being published by the household press as well as makers of yarns and threads. This period of time is when pot-holders blossomed into the useful, diverse art form that is recognized by [[needlework]]ers today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Common types of pot-holder making at home include quilting,  knitting,  and crocheting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pot Holders for All Seasons: 20 Fun &amp; Easy Projects|last=Malone|first=Chris|publisher=Berne, IN: Annie's|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=25 Potholders to Knit: Classic, Playful, and Festive Patterns|last=Tiselius|first=Stina|publisher=Trafalgar Square|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crochet Potholders and Dishcloths|last=Weiss|first=Rita|publisher=Leisure Arts, Inc|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques use different mediums such as yarn or scraps of fabric in order to create pot-holders of all different colors and patterns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many "DIY" tutorials teach how to make a simple square pot-holder, but there are also many that teach a variety of shapes, sizes, and designs, including little houses or flowers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These homemade kitchen tools are often considered good for home decor or gift giving.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In advertising ==
By the early 20th century, pot-holders were regularly featured in United States' advertisements. They were featured in magazine and newspaper ads for kitchen appliances, usually providing protection between a woman's hands and her pot or pan of freshly cooked food.

'''Reactive multi-layer '''foils are a class of [[Reactive material|reactive materials]], sometimes referred to as a [[pyrotechnic composition|pyrotechnic initiator]] of two mutually reactive metals, [[Sputter deposition|sputtered]] to form [[thin layer]]s that create a [[laminate]]d [[foil (metal)|foil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indium.com/nanofoil/|title=NanoFoil made by Indium Corporation|first=Quadsimia Internet Solutions -|last=http://www.quadsimia.com/|website=Indium Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; On initiation by a heat pulse, delivered by a [[bridge wire]], a [[laser]] pulse, an [[electric spark]], a [[flame]], or by other means, the metals undergo self-sustaining [[exothermic reaction]], producing an [[intermetallic]] compound. The reaction occurs in solid and liquid phase only, without releasing any gas. 

One particular type of such materials is aluminum-nickel multilayered foil, that produces  (NiAl). Other similar materials are composed of aluminium-[[titanium]], or titanium-[[amorphous silicon]], are used for joining materials by [[reactive bonding]]. Other similar intermetallic compositions used in pyrotechnics are [[titanium]]-[[boron]] and [[aluminium]]-[[palladium]] ("Pyrofuze").

These foils are made in a range of thicknesses, e.g. 60, 80, 100, and 150 micrometers. The flame front propagation rate ranges generally between 7.5–9&amp;nbsp;m/s. The reaction temperature can reach up to 1500&amp;nbsp;°C for a millisecond. The energy released is approximately 1200 to 1300 joules per gram.&lt;ref name="act1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indium.com/blog/nanofoil/0/0/nanofoil-basics-activation-part-i|title=NanoFoil® - Indium Corporation Blogs|website=blogs.indium.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The velocity and temperature of the reaction can be controlled by adjusting the thickness of the layers. Typical thickness is 50&amp;nbsp;nm &lt;!-- (about 25 atoms) - dubious, does not add up with van der waals radiuses --&gt; per a bilayer.&lt;ref name="llnl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/October05/Barbee.html|title=S&amp;TR - October 2005: NanoFoil Solders with Less|first=Internet Publishing Team, Technical Information|last=Department|website=www.llnl.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thin layers maximize the contact between the metal and lower the [[activation energy]] for the reaction, normally too high to allow reaction between bulk aluminium and bulk nickel. The layers are deposited by sequential [[sputtering]] of alternately nickel and aluminium.

Nickel aluminide  will ignite on heating to at least 250&amp;nbsp;°C in rate of at least 200&amp;nbsp;°C/min. Slower heating will anneal the material, causing loss of its pyrotechnic properties. For electrical initiation, a momentary contact at 10A/5V is sufficient; for ohmic contact, 120-150 amperes is needed for a 15 micrometer diameter contact, and 250-300&amp;nbsp;A for a 300 micrometer contact.&lt;ref name="nanobond" /&gt; It can be also ignited by a heat paper. When the flame front reaches the edge of the material, particles of molten metal can be ejected, causing voids in the bond; this can be prevented by simultaneous ignition from more sides, so the flame fronts meet in the middle, confined by the substrates.&lt;ref name="act2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indium.com/blog/tommy-acchione/0/0/nanofoilr-basics-activation-part-ii|title=- Indium Corporation Blogs|website=blogs.indium.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foil  can be both [[laser cutting|cut]] and ignited by a [[laser]]. The pulse width and power determines if the material will be cut or initiated.&lt;ref name="act1" /&gt;It is frequently used for [[soldering]] and [[brazing]], as a heat source. When sandwiched between the components to be joined, either with a foil of solder on each side, using solder precoated components, or using solder-coated foil, it uniformly delivers significant amount of heat energy across the entire area, melting the [[solder]] and only locally heating the surface of the substrates, lowering the heat load on the component in comparison with soldering/brazing in a [[furnace]]. An externally applied even pressure during reaction and cooling serves to ensure a good homogeneous joint without voids. &lt;ref name="nanobond"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indium.com/_dynamo/download.php?docid=932|title=Indium Corporation Global Solder Supplier Electronics Assembly Materials|first=Quadsimia Internet Solutions -|last=http://www.quadsimia.com/|website=Indium Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly dissimilar materials can be bonded without cracking: semiconductors, metals, ceramics, and polymers.&lt;ref name="llnl" /&gt; The energy is deposited very locally, without significant heating of the bulk of the substrates, which reduces problems with mismatched [[thermal expansion coefficient]]s between the materials and allows their joining at room temperature.

==Uses==
The bonding process can be used in assembly of [[electronics]], [[die attachment]] to [[heatsink]]s where high temperature stability is required (e.g. high-power [[LED]]s or [[concentrated photovoltaics]] [[solar panel]]s, soldering together layers of [[composite armor]] plates, bonding of large [[sputtering]] targets made of ceramics or [[refractory metal]]s where normal [[indium]] based solders cannot be used, and other applications where a uniform joint over large area has to be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indium.com/blog/nanofoil/0/0/nanofoilr-nanotech-comes-to-indium-corporation|title=NanoFoil® - Indium Corporation Blogs|website=blogs.indium.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foil  can be used as a [[pyrotechnic heat source]], a replacement of [[potassium chlorate]]/[[iron]] pellets, for [[thermal battery|thermal batteries]]. It reacts faster than the conventional composition, reaches higher temperatures, and heat buffers of inert metal (e.g. steel) are needed to lower the peak temperature and prolong the heat delivery.&lt;ref&gt;http://armyscienceconference.com/manuscripts/H/HP-08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
They  can be also used as an electrically initiated [[pyrotechnic initiator]], e.g. to ignite [[solid propellant]]s, and in [[decoy flare]]s. They can be employed in weapons as [[reactive material]]s, enhancing the energy delivery to the targets by the projectiles or their fragments.

Normally, several types of reference circuits are defined, with different configurations, because [[Telecommunication|communications]] are required over a wide range of distances. Another type of reference circuit shows how to configure integrated circuits into function blocks, which Analog Devices provides for electrical design engineers.  Analog Devices' Circuits from the Lab reference circuits are fully tested and come with the schematics, evaluation boards, and device drivers necessary for system integration.  A group of related reference circuits is also called a ''[[reference system]]''.

In 1972, she quit her job selling computer [[time-sharing]] for [[General Electric]] and devoted more of her time to starting a family.&lt;ref name=entrepreneur&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197656 |title=Sandra Kurtzig |publisher=[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]] |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She founded ASK Group as a part-time job, using $2,000 of her own savings.&lt;ref name=sbeat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconbeat.com/2013/06/10/sandra-kurtzigs-kenandy-cloud-startup-scores-33-million-from-lightspeed/ |title=Sandra Kurtzig's Kenandy cloud startup scores $33 million from Lightspeed |publisher=SiliconBeat |date=2013-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ceo&gt;{{cite book|author=Sandra L.

Realizing that other manufacturers might find such a program useful, she recruited several graduates with degrees in engineering and computers. They wrote standardized applications that addressed problems faced by local manufacturers under her direction.&lt;ref name=entrepreneur/&gt;

Kurtzig reinvested all profits into growing the company. Her company required access to [[minicomputer]]s and she persuaded employees at a nearby [[Hewlett-Packard]] plant to allow her company to use one of the company's [[HP 3000]]  minicomputers outside of normal working hours. By 1978, ASK released a package of programs called Manman, one of the first [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) software suites.&lt;ref name=entrepreneur/&gt; She later concluded a deal for Hewlett Packard to sell Manman for use on HP3000 minicomputers, at a time when most ERP software was only available to run on more expensive [[mainframe computer]]s.&lt;ref name=techweek&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/sandra-kurtzig-founder-of-ask-group-secures-33-million-for-new-venture-118623 |title=Sandra Kurtzig, Founder Of ASK Group, Secures $33 Million For New Venture |work=[[TechWeek (magazine)|TechWeek]] |date=2013-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company went public on [[NASDAQ]] in 1981, and in 1983, Kurtzig's personal stake in the ASK Group was worth $67 million.&lt;ref name=techweek/&gt;  She resigned from her role of CEO of the ASK Group in 1985.&lt;ref name=techweek/&gt; but returned in 1989 to refocus and once again grow the company. ASK bought [[IngresCorporation|Ingres Corporation]] in November 1990. At its peak, the company's annual sales were just under $1 billion U.S. dollars.

In 2010 she founded the enterprise management software company [[Kenandy]], where she served as the CEO through 2015 and is currently the Chairman.&lt;ref name=wsj1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenandy.com/leadership |title=Executive Leadership and Board of Directors |publisher=Kenandy |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenandy specializes in producing cloud ERP solutions for manufacturing businesses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kenandy is named after Kurtzig's sons, Ken and Andy,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gould, Lawrence S.

A '''Silky Cup''' is a type of [[feminine hygiene]] product which is made of thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), shaped like a bell and is flexible. It is worn inside the [[vagina]] during [[menstruation]] to catch menstrual fluid ([[blood]]).  About every 4–12 hours (depending on the amount of flow), the menstruating woman removes the Silky cup from her vagina, empties the collected menstrual blood into a toilet or sink, washes the cup under running water and inserts it again. At the end of the monthly period, the cup can be sterilized, usually by boiling in water. Unlike [[tampons]] and [[sanitary napkin|pads]], the cup ''collects'' menstrual fluid rather than ''absorbing'' it.

Silky Cup is the Indian market leader in the reusable menstrual cup market and largest menstrual cup manufacturer in India. Silky Cup has biggest manufacturing production line of the menstrual cup in India.&lt;ref&gt;India.http://www.silkycup.com/aboutus-1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety, Quality and Standards ==
The Silky Cup is tested within International standards. ISO 10993 is a Quality Standard governed by the International Organization of Standardization in Geneva, Switzerland, and is recognized and practiced in over 160 countries around the world. ISO 10993 is the quality standard for medical devices.

Silky Cup is safe; Silky Cup is developed especially for menstrual hygiene management. Silky Cup has been tested as per United States pharmacopeia (USP) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) International standards. Silky Cup has passed the all necessary ISO 10993 tests with great success.

'''''“Silky Cup is tested according to ISO 10993-5 (Cytotoxicity), ISO 10993-10 (Mucosal Irritation), ISO 10993-10 (Sensitization), Directive 2011/65/EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (ROHS), USP &lt;88&gt; “CLASS VI” Tests Acute Systemic Injection, Intracutaneous Injection and Implantation.'''''

== Objectives ==

In many countries across the world, [[menstruation]] can be a problem, as women and girls may have no access to hygiene products, or simply cannot afford them. These women often experience exclusion from society, and school, college or work can be disrupted or restricted due to lack of available solutions. Investigative studies identify one of the main causes of early school leaving as the lack of hygiene products available for menstruating women and girls. As a result, menstruation has a direct economic and educational impact. Silky cups are a solution that can help girls and women to be integrated back into their social lives. Silky Cup is a product and a social strategy that offers women in [[Developing country|developing countries]] a lifelong solution and support.

'''Social BI''', or '''Social Business Intelligence''', refers to the creation, publishing and sharing of custom [[business analytics]] reports and [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboard]]s by end users of ''[[Cloud computing|Cloud]]'' technologies.

Social or collaborative BI is the use of Enterprise 2.0 tools and practices with business intelligence outputs for the purpose of making collective decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forteconsultancy.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/social-bi-for-intelligent-enterprise-2-0/ |title=Social BI for Intelligent Enterprise 2.0 |accessdate= 12 November 2014 |publisher= Forte Consultancy Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; First enabled by the rapid growth of [[social media]] networks in 2009, Social BI allows for the collaborative development of post user-generated analytics among [[business analyst]]s and data mining professionals.  This has removed previous barriers to [[business intelligence|self-service BI]] while still employing traditional analytics applications.

Social BI can also be interpreted as providing business intelligence based on social networks data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.groupcharger.com/social-business-intelligence/ |title=1 Social Business Intelligence |accessdate= 28 November 2011 |publisher= GroupCharger}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a company selling consumer electronics goods needs to know how people are responding to their latest advertisements or promotions. The reports and visualizations made using social media represent what people are talking about in real time. Pulling data from different social media and preparing understandable reports will help company to decide upon further steps. These dashboards, [[Computer graphics|visualizations]], reports based on social media will be of help for companies to get efficient feedback and act accordingly.

==History==
On September 13, 2011, [[Dachis Group]] introduced the Social Business Index to provide some insights into how ‘social’ companies are, and how they stack up against similar corporations in their respective industries and their competitors, and provide some ‘social business’ benchmarks by company, subsidiary, geography, department and brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/dachis-group-debuts-social-business-index-think-of-it-as-klout-for-companies/ |title=2 Dachis Group Debuts ‘Social Business Index’ – Think Of It As Klout For Companies |accessdate= 28 November 2011 |author= Robin Wauters |date= 2011-09-13 |work= |publisher= Techcrunch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steam eor1.jpg|thumb|Steam is injected into many oil fields where the oil is thicker and heavier than normal crude oil. This sketch illustrates '''steam flooding'''.]]
'''Steam injection''' is an increasingly common method of extracting [[heavy crude oil]].  It is considered an [[enhanced oil recovery]] (EOR) method and is the main type of thermal stimulation of oil reservoirs.  There are several different forms of the technology, with the two main ones being Cyclic Steam Stimulation and Steam Flooding.  Both are most commonly applied to oil reservoirs, which are relatively shallow and which contain crude oils which are very viscous at the temperature of the native underground formation.  Steam injection is widely used in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] of California (USA), the [[Lake Maracaibo]] area of Venezuela, and the oil sands of northern Alberta (Canada).

Another contributing factor that enhances oil production during steam injection is related to near-wellbore cleanup. In this case, steam reduces the viscosity that ties [[Kerosene|paraffins]] and [[asphaltenes]] to the rock surfaces while steam distillation of crude oil light ends creates a small solvent bank that can miscibly remove trapped oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=steamflood|publisher=Schlumberger Limited|series=Oilfield Glossary|title=steamflood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) ==
[[File:Cyclic steam stimulation, oil well.pdf|thumb|A graphical explanation of the Cyclic Steam Stimulation method]]
This method, also known as the Huff and Puff method, consists of 3 stages: injection, soaking, and production.  Steam is first injected into a well for a certain amount of time to heat the oil in the surrounding reservoir to a recover approximately 20% of the Original Oil in Place (OOIP), compared to steam assisted gravity drainage, which has been reported to recover over 50% of OOIP.  It is quite common for wells to be produced in the cyclic steam manner for a few cycles before being put on a steam flooding regime with other wells.

The mechanism proceeds through cycles of steam injection, soak, and oil production. First, steam is injected into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340° [[Celsius]] for a period of weeks to months.  Next, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation.  Finally, the hot oil is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil.&lt;ref name="butler104"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Roger|title=Thermal Recovery of Oil and Bitumen|year=1991|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CSS method has the advantage that recovery factors are around 20 to 25% and the disadvantage that the cost to inject steam is high.

[[Canadian Natural Resources]] use "employs cyclic steam or "huff and puff" technology to develop bitumen resources. This technology requires one well bore and the production consists of the injection and production phases. First steam is "injected for several weeks, mobilizing cold bitumen". Then the flow "on the injection well is reversed producing oil through the same injection well bore. The injection and production phases together comprise one cycle. "Steam is re-injected to begin a new cycle when oil production rates fall below a critical threshold due to the cooling of the reservoir."{{harv|CNRL|2013}}&lt;ref name="CNRL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|publisher=CNRL|year=2013|title=Cyclic Steam Stimulation|series=Thermal in situ oil sands|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016105950/http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|archivedate=2015-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steam Flooding==
In a steam flood, sometimes known as a steam drive, some wells are used as steam injection wells and other wells are used for oil production. Two mechanisms are at work to improve the amount of oil recovered.  The first is to heat the oil to higher temperatures and to thereby decrease its viscosity so that it more easily flows through the formation toward the producing wells. A second mechanism is the physical displacement employing in a manner similar to [[water flooding]], in which oil is meant to be pushed to the production wells.  While more steam is needed for this method than for the cyclic method, it is typically more effective at recovering a larger portion of the oil.

A form of steam flooding that has become popular in the [[Alberta oil sands]] is [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), in which two horizontal wells are drilled, one a few meters above the other, and steam is injected into the upper one.  The intent is to reduce the viscosity of the bitumen to the point where gravity will pull it down into the producing well.

In 2011 [[Laricina Energy]] combined solvent injection with steam injection in a process called solvent cyclic steam-assisted gravity drainage (SC-SAGD).{{harv|Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers CAPP|2009}}&lt;ref name=CAPP2009&gt;{{cite report|title=Solvents in situ: the Hybrid Car of the Oil Sands|quote=Oil sands operators are exploring the use solvents with [[steam-assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD) to help loosen and extract bitumen. Laricina Energy CEO [[Glen Schmidt]] likens the technology to a hybrid car|url=http://www.capp.ca/ENERGYSUPPLY/INNOVATIONSTORIES/AIR/Pages/Solvents-in-situ.aspx#CLqWUIphF8kx|publisher=Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429163438/http://www.capp.ca/energySupply/innovationStories/Air/Pages/Solvents-in-situ.aspx#CLqWUIphF8kx|archivedate=2012-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laricina claims that combining solvents with steam reduces the overall steam oil ratio for recovery by 30%.

The alternative to surface generated steam is downhole steam generation that reduces heat loss and generates high-quality steam in the reservoir that allows for more heavy oil and oil sands production at a faster rate. Downhole steam generators were first proposed by the major oil companies in the early 1960s. Over the last 50 years multiple downhole steam technologies have been developed such as the DOE and SANDIA downhole combustion system known as Project Deep Steam that was field tested in Long Beach, CA in 1982, but was a failure. The only downhole steam generator that has proved successful is branded as eSteam and is more fully described on its technology website at www.esteamoil.com.

'''Sugaring''' is a food preservation method similar to [[pickling]].  Sugaring is the process of [[drying (food)|desiccating]] a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar.  This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as [[honey]], syrup or [[molasses]].

The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage.  Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as [[ginger]].  From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations.  For example, honey was used as part of the [[mummy|mummification]] process in some ancient Egyptian rites.

A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture.  Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.  This leads to the process of [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].  Although [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.

'''TEDOM a.s''' is a Czech engineering company which was established by Ing. Josef Jeleček in [[Třebíč]] in 1991.TEDOM is an abbreviation of the Czech words '''TE'''plo '''DOM'''ova [The warmth of home]. The primary scope of business of the company is the development and production of [[Cogeneration|CHP]] (combined heat and power) units with gas combustion engines. Aside from CHP units, the company's product portfolio also includes a [[gas heat pump]] and combustion engines, all of them designed by TEDOM.

At its inception, TEDOM initially operated as a limited liability company. From 1994, a [[holding company]] had been gradually established where TEDOM held the leading position. In 2010, the holding company became a [[Joint-stock company|joint stock company]], and TEDOM a.s. was created. Presently, TEDOM a.s. operates in more than 40 countries worldwide. In 2016, TEDOM acquired the German company of [[SCHNELL Motoren]] with the aim to lead with TEDOM products in the German market. In 2017 TEDOM established the TEDOM Group – a group of companies that share property with TEDOM. All members of the group deal with either development, production, installation or operation of CHP units.

== History ==
TEDOM was established as a limited liability company in 1991. It was established by Ing. Josef Jeleček. The scope of business for TEDOM s.r.o. from its beginning was the development, production and sales of CHP units with gas-piston combustion engines. The first CHP unit, the TEDOM MT 22 with an output of 22 kW that used the Škoda 781 four-cylinder [[spark-ignition engine]] from the [[Škoda Favorit]]-model series passenger car, was put into operation this same year.

In 1993, close cooperation was initiated with VKS s.r.o. in [[Hořovice]]. This company became the manufacturer of mechanical components for CHP units while TEDOM focused on the production of electrical parts and sales/regional service of CHP units. A new TEDOM MT 130A CHP unit type with an output of 130&amp;nbsp;kW was developed that year. This CHP unit model employed the model M630-series [[LIAZ (Czech Republic)|LIAZ]] 12-litre spark-ignition 6-cylinder engine (from the model [[LIAZ 100 series|LIAZ 100]] truck).

In 1994, TEDOM started a gradual creation of a holding company. The first subsidiary was [[Třebíčská Tepelná Společnost s.r.o.]] This subsidiary leased and consequently started operation of the thermal and energy system in the town of Třebíč. The second subsidiary, TEPLO Ivančice s.r.o., responsible for the operation of the thermal system of the town of [[Ivančice]], was established in 1996. The third subsidiary, Jesenická Tepelná Společnost s.r.o., which operates the thermal system in the town of Jesenice, was created in 1997. TEDOM Energo s.r.o. was established in 1999 (originally Příborská Tepelná Společnost s.r.o.). TEDOM Energo s.r.o. started to provide a majority of the activities associated with the production of power and heat within the Czech Republic. In 2000, an additional company, TENERGO Brno a.s. was founded. TENERGO Brno a.s. specialises in operating the thermal and energy systems in Slovakia. In 2003, TEDOM became a member of [[COGEN Europe]] (European Association for the Promotion of Cogeneration).

In 2000, individual products were innovated and the new product lines of Premi and CENTO were developed. In 2001, TEDOM oriented its focus on CHP units that operate on [[biogas]]. Following this move, a new series of TEDOM CHP units adapted to operate on biogas was introduced in 2002 and the new QUANTO product series was born.

In 2003, TEDOM acquired the JAMOT plant (an engine works plant in Jablonec) in an auction sale.  It was a former facility of LIAZ s.r.o. in [[Jablonec nad Nisou]]. The engine manufacturing plant became an integral part of TEDOM s.r.o. as a separate motors division. Consequently, the production of low-floor city buses was started in 2004 and the TEDOM city bus prototype was introduced equipped with a TEDOM engine that burned [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG). The 1000th CHP unit made under the TEDOM mark was installed in the same year as well.

In 2005, a new product line of MICRO CHP units was introduced.

In 2006, the grand opening of a new TEDOM manufacturing plant for the assembly of low-floor city buses took place in Třebíč. Additionally, TEDOM continued to manufacture trucks and engines to modernise the [[ČD Class 810|810-series railway vehicles]] into the [[ČD Class 814|814-series motor units]].

In 2008, the 2000th CHP unit of the TEDOM trademark was put into operation. Later in the same year, TEDOM Holding was divided into two parts: 25% of the assets passed to TTS Holding, the energy producer, and 75% of the assets remained in TEDOM Holding for the development and production of power engineering technologies. As agreed upon by the partners, TTS Holding was separated to the benefit of the exiting partner, Mr Richard Horký.; the transaction amounted to 60 million CZK. Since that time, TEDOM has focused exclusively on the production of technologies.

In 2010, a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] of the companies took place. The companies joined in the merger were TEDOM s.r.o., TEDOM ENERGO s.ro., TEDOM CHP s.r.o., Jesenická Tepelná Společnost s.r.o., and TEDOM Holding s.r.o., and the newly established joint stock company of TEDOM a.s.

Since 2011, ČEZ Energo s.r.o. operates in the Czech market as the operator of a decentralized power plant.  This plant currently comprises almost 100 CHP units with a total output of more than 72MW and it is jointly owned and operated by ČEZ a.s. and TEDOM a.s. The TEDOM share is 49.9%.

In 2012, the production of city buses was terminated. At the same time, a new product was developed – the POLO 100 gas [[heat pump]] that, in the following year, won the Innovation of the Year Award in the "Czech Energy and Ecological Project" competition. It was this same year that TEDOM entered into a contract with the leading Czech power engineering company of ČEZ for the delivery and service of CHP units: TEDOM agreed to deliver more than 100 CHP units with a total electrical output exceeding 100MW within a five-year period.

In 2013, the extensive foreign project in Sydney, was completed, where TEDOM built two [[trigeneration]] centres with a total electrical output of 11.8MW.

In 2016, TEDOM won 52nd place in the "[[Czech Top 100]]" competition of companies. In this competition, TEDOM has won its position in the top 100 companies consistently since 2013.

In 2016, TEDOM celebrated 25 years of operation and more than 3500 manufactured CHP units with the TEDOM trademark. In collaboration with American company [[Tecogen Inc.]], a joint venture of TTCogen was established to sell the TEDOM CHP units in US territory. TEDOM has a 50% share in TTCogen. The same year, TEDOM also acquired the German company [[SCHNELL Motoren]] – one of the leading manufacturers of CHP units intended predominantly for biogas plants. TEDOM took over the company assets and 300 employees of the manufacturing plant in Wangen, including an extensive service network. Also in the same year, TEDOM won an award from the [[HSBC|HSBC Bank]] to become the winner of the [[HSBC International Business Award]] competition.

In 2017 TEDOM and other companies, that share property with TEDOM, started to act together within the TEDOM Group. Members of the TEDOM Group are: TEDOM a.s., Schnell GmbH and ČEZ energo s.r.o. Common goals of all group members are a mutual support while producing and operating energy-saving machines for the combined production of heat and power and a mutual cooperation on the global market.

In 2018 the TTCogen joint venture was terminated. TEDOM continues to operate in the US through its subsidiary TEDOM USA Inc.

== TEDOM Products ==

=== CHP Units ===

TEDOM specializes in export, production, installation and operation of CHP units. Furthermore, it offers the associated accessories and services.

TEDOM offers CHP units in three product series: MICRO (up to 50&amp;nbsp;kW), CENTO (up to 500&amp;nbsp;kW), QUANTO (up to 10 MW). The products of each individual line are manufactured in two basic configurations: with an operation [[frequency]] of 50 [[Hertz]] (intended mostly for the European market) or 60 Hertz (intended mostly for the American market). Aside from natural gas, most of the CHP units are also capable of operating on [[biogas]], [[landfill gas]], or mine gas. The company offers CHP units in several versions depending on which environment the unit must operate in: a version without a sound enclosure (for installation into sound-proof areas), with a sound enclosure (for indoor installations), and a container version (for outdoor installations).
CHP units are closely related to trigeneration units, but in addition to power and heat, the trigeneration units also produce cold energy. TEDOM included the trigeneration units in its portfolio as well.

The company additionally offers products associated with CHP unit operation (gas treatment plants, exhaust heat exchangers, economisers, and other related equipment).
The company also offers the TEDOM Polo 100 gas heat pump.[[TEDOM#cite note-35|&lt;sup&gt;[35]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Aside from its own produced engines, TEDOM equips its CHP units with engines made by Kubota, [[Liebherr]], MAN, MWM and [[Rolls-Royce|Rolls Royce]]. [[TEDOM#cite note-36|&lt;sup&gt;[36]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

=== Road Technique ===
[[File:TEDOM-400-FOX Radlo-P1000665.JPG|thumb|TEDOM FOX Truck]]
In 2004, TEDOM's Bus Division started production of a low-floor city bus driven by a natural gas engine. The company obtained the necessary [[know-how]] by buying the licence from the Italian manufacturer Mauri. Thus, in 2004 TEDOM became the third bus manufacturer in the Czech Republic after [[Karosa]] ([[Iveco Czech Republic]] since 2007) and [[SOR Libchavy]]. A new manufacturing plant was built in Třebíč in connection with these business activities. However, of the originally planned manufacture of a thousand pieces, the new manufacturing plant was able to produce no more than about 200 buses that were delivered mainly to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Germany. Due to a lack of job orders, TEDOM decided to terminate bus production in January 2012.

In 2006, TEDOM Truck s.r.o. was created as a subsidiary company to TEDOM. This company followed up on the production of LIAZ trucks. Specifically, the [[LIAZ 300]] and [[LIAZ 400]] model. The necessary know-how came associated with the acquisition of the Jablonec engine works plant. The company started to sell trucks under the new TEDOM name. The portfolio offered trucks driven by either a diesel engine (TEDOM-D) or a gas engine (TEDOM-G). However, in total, the company delivered a mere 19 units during its entire existence, only to end up in liquidation as decided in a general meeting in 2009.

[[File:Transfer bench.jpg|alt=A white plastic bench sits with two legs inside a bathtub and two legs outside the tub resting on the floor.|thumb|Transfer bench ready for use]]
A '''transfer bench''', (also known as a '''showering bench''', '''shower bench''', or transfer chair) is a bath safety [[mobility device]] which the user sits on to get into a [[bathtub]].  The user usually sits on the bench, which straddles the side of the tub, and gradually slides from the outside to the inside of the tub.  Tub transfer benches are used by people who have trouble getting over the tub wall or into the shower, either because of illness or disability.

==Types of Transfer Benches==
===Non-Sliding===

A basic transfer bench typically consists of a backrest, long seat, and four legs. The legs inside the tub sometimes have plungers at their base that grip the tub's surface for stability.  There are many different kinds, customized for the patient's needs.  The size, (usually adjustable) height, and width can all vary.  The user gets on the seat from the outside of the tub and scoots over on the seat to the inside, lifting one leg at a time over the tub's side.   

Various optional accessories are available, such as a padded seat, [[commode]] opening, support backrests, or swing-away armrests.

===Sliding or Rolling Transfer Benches===

This varies from the transfer bench, in that instead of scooting to the other side, the user does not have to move their hips across the seat.  The user simply sits on a seat and then slides to the other side, usually on rails or some kind of sliding frame. This reduces friction considerably and eases the movement for more highly dependent patients.  

Shower or bath benches come in different lengths, along with such options as padded seats, swivel seats, and cut-out seats.  
Some are freestanding, while others attach to the side of the tub.  There are also models that integrate with a wheeled chair, with the transfer frame in the tub connecting to the chair.

A newly developed shower bench design has three sets of rails that dock together permitting a seated patient to roll from a mobile chair into a bathtub or shower. The first set of rails is part of a mobile chair and they sit below a detachable seat consisting of a seat rest, backrest, and optional armrests. The second rail set sits in the tub or shower and has a base similar to a common four-legged shower bench. The third set of rails are "connecting rails" that dock with the other two sets and creates a connecting bridge between them.  

To use this type of shower bench, the caregivers first places the shower bench with rails in the bath or shower and stabilizes it. The caregiver then aligns the bridging rails with the shower bench's rails and locks them together using a cam lock. The next step is to roll the mobile chair (with seated patient) in position, and align and lock the mobile chair's rails with the bridge's rails (on the opposite side) again using a cam lock. Once the three sets of rails are connected, the caregiver can roll the chair (with the seated patient) over the rails laterally, off the wheeled base of the mobile chair, across the bridge, and into the shower or bath. The shower bench supports the seated patient and chair during bathing or showering.

The bridge rails and wheeled base can then be disconnected and moved away so the caregiver can have unobstructed access to the patient for bathing. When bathing is finished, the reverse process moves the patient from the bath back into the mobile chair.  

Shower benches are often used in conjunction with a [[patient lift]] for highly dependent patients who cannot be manually moved from a [[wheelchair]] to the shower bench. In this case, the patient is hoisted in the sling-lift from a [[wheelchair]] or [[stretcher]] and seated on the shower bench so that they can then slide into the bath or shower.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5676">'''Unconventional computing''' is [[computing]] by a wide range of new or unusual methods. It is also known as '''alternative computing'''.

The term of "unconventional computation" was coined by [[Cristian S. Calude]] and [[John Casti]] and used for the first edition of the international Conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Unconventional Models of Computation 1998 | url = https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/research/groups/CDMTCS/conferences/umc98/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auckland, New Zealand 1998 (see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = C.S. Calude | title = Unconventional Computing: A Brief Subjective History, CDMTCS Report 480, 2015 | url = http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/research/groups/CDMTCS/researchreports/?download&amp;paper_file=548}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Background==

The general theory of computation allows for a variety of models.  Historically, however, computing technology first developed using mechanical methods, and eventually evolved into using electronic techniques, which remain the state-of-the-art.  Further development may require development of new technologies.{{why|date=December 2016}}

===Mechanical computing===
{{main|Mechanical computer}}

Historically, [[mechanical computer]]s were used in industry before the advent of the [[transistor]].

Mechanical computers retain some interest today both in research and as analogue computers. Some mechanical computers have a theoretical or didactic relevance, such as [[billiard-ball computer]]s or hydraulic ones,.&lt;ref name=pen-empnew&gt;[[Roger Penrose|Penrose, Roger]]: The Emperor's New Mind. Oxford University Press, 1990. See also corresponding [[The Emperor's New Mind|article on it]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While some are actually simulated, others are not{{clarify|vacuous|date=December 2016}}. No attempt is made{{dubious|date=December 2016}} to build a functioning computer through the mechanical collisions of billiard balls. The [[domino computer]] is another theoretically interesting mechanical computing scheme.{{why|date=December 2016}}

===Electronic digital computers===

Most modern computers are electronic computers with the [[Von Neumann architecture]] based on digital electronics, with extensive integration made possible following the invention of the transistor and the scaling of [[Moore's Law]].

Unconventional computing is, according to a{{which|date=December 2016}} conference description,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Unconventional computation Conference 2007 | url = http://cnls.lanl.gov/uc07/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; "an interdisciplinary research area with the main goal to enrich or go beyond the standard models, such as the [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann computer architecture]] and the [[Turing machine]], which have dominated computer science for more than half a century". These methods model their computational operations based on non-standard paradigms, and are currently mostly in the research and development stage.

This computing behavior can be "simulated"{{clarify|date=December 2016}} using the classical silicon-based micro-transistors or [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] computing technologies, but aim to achieve a new kind of computing.

[[File:Zalai malmok.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Watermills on Zala river in the end of 19th century]]

For centuries, the '''watermills on the [[Zala (river)|Zala]] river''' ([[Zala County]], [[Western Transdanubia]], [[Hungary]]) had co-existed in a single harmonious unity with each other as well as with the river, the Zala valley and Zala meadow, both latter ones renowned for their beauty. Landscape rehabilitation would indeed be necessary because due to the closure of the mills and the destruction of the sluices, the level of the ground water in the meadows, usually having very loamy soil, has dramatically decreased, which has had detrimental impacts on the condition of the meadows. The declining tendency in the grassland culture hasn’t helped either. What is more, in several cases parts of the meadows were turned into arable lands or industrial sites. The final blow to the deteriorating meadows that gradually grew characterless was dealt by the disgraceful regulation of the river Zala (rather meaning its canalisation) in the beginning of the 1960s (Izsák 2016). A further station of the process was the elimination of the mills from the life of the river for all. 
„There were about 200 known steam mills and watermills in the county Zala at the end of the 1800s (the territory of the county was much larger at that time though)(Molnár 2015). According to the statistical data of the Zala county archives of the year 1949, there were about 180 mills in operation in the county then (140 of which located in the county’s present, smaller territory). In the beginning of the 1940s, there were still about 37 mills grinding on the river Zala (Izsák and Kummer 2011). 
One can still find water in some old mill-ponds. For the history of a miller's family see Jakosa 2011, 2012, both in Hungarian). These ponds provide suitable habitat for some aquatic organisms. As for the history of the published data and photos, I. Hajdu, J. Izsák, Á. Jakosa, Gy. Kummer  and Mrs. M. Marx, the latter working with Göcseji Muzeum, Zalaegerszeg decided in 2004 to start gathering documents and data systematically on the watermills along the river Zala. We have based our selection of the mills to be presented on a list from the year 1949 preserved in the Zala-county archives. The chart was provided by Mr. Gy. Kummer. A significant number of the photos were also taken by him. The mills indicated by red characters exist today mainly in documents and in the mind's eye only. For the possibility of hydropower by the water of small rivers, e.g. Zala, see Gerse 2014.

== Operation ==

By sluice („barrage”), usually the full sluice system as well as the sluice gates themselves were referred to in live speech. The couple-of-hundred-meter-long section of the river above the mills that can be swollen by (wooden) sluice gates is called the head race. The river banks right above the sluice gate were often protected by concrete walls from erosion. On this river section, the lowered sluice gate barred and „swelled” or  „held” water behind it as one of the preparatory steps of grinding. By the way, the higher or lower position of the sluice before the turbine chamber and before the run-out to the mill-pond, one could control the volume of the water running through the turbine chamber to  rotate the turbine. This latter ensured the energy necessary for milling.  When grinding, the water was let out to flow onto the turbine encased in the turbine chamber protected by a lattice. From thereon, the water left the turbine chamber via its outlet into the mill pit. (Driftwood and other debris were cleared from the lattice by a rake.) Of course, in the meantime, the water level in the head race continuously decreased as the water was „let out” or „released”. Sluice gates could be raised or let down by specific iron structures. Directly above the sluice gate, practically annexed to it stood the sluice bridge that made it possible to get close to the sluice gates. One could also cross the river using this little bridge. There also used to be a larger bridge on the head race suited for the transportation of grains and flour, but it had usually been ruined by the 1950s and 1960s. During swelling, if the water level in the head race reached the upper edge of the lowered sluice gate, the water cascaded over it, and showered onto a concrete surface producing characteristic sounds, and then rushed into the wide and (3-to-8-meter) deep mill pit. The mill pit was used to be called mill pond in other locations. The expressions appearing in this paragraph aren’t uniformly used anyway. It is certain though that the anglers in Zalaegerszeg used these terms in the 1950s. At the lower end of the mill pit that narrowed again, usually a crescent-shaped gravel islet formed. The following outflow section was shallow, and continuously deepened again. The water often meandered along an extended tract, flowing ever slower, and getting ever deeper, to become the head race of the following mill. In some cases, the river was bifurcated above the mill by digging a new branch leading to the mill (and serving as its „head race” or „leat”). On the other branch („small branch) there was also a sluice called „small sluice”. (If I remember well, the related smaller „mill pond” was also called a small pond by the anglers in the past.) By the sluice, one could control the amount of water flowing towards the main branch of the river. The small pond located behind the small sluice flowed into the small branch to rejoin the main branch after about 100 to 200 meters. As far as I recall, small branches and small sluices could only be found in Zalaegerszeg or further downward on the river Zala (but not even there in all the cases: e.g. in the 50’s the Baumgartner mill in Zalaegerszeg didn’t feature a small sluice). In the riverbed hollows or incavations could form while in other tracts the water was shallow and running. During floods, everything got messed up: in the stead of the river Zala and its meadow, a spectacular, uninterrupted expanse of water appeared that a few days later receded. 
In several comments, we refer to piles sticking out from or standing in the water in the immediate vicinity of the mills. The corner of the mill closest to the water was often supported by such a pile. In other cases, the piles upheld a proper planking above the water. Standing on such a planking, one could do maintenance work on the sluice gates, e.g. defrost them. But similar piles may also be remains of old-time wooden bridges.                                                                                             
The structure equipped with its own little roof and window often raised on top of the mill building is the ventage of the powder-house, but it could also be used to accommodate the protruding end of the elevator. One could often see a „rain panel” sticking out above the door of the building that protected the people and the sacs from the rain during loading. The by-products of grinding could be used to feed pigs and poultry. Therefore, apart from the stable housing the work-horses, there were often piggeries, henneries or even pigeonries in the vicinity of the mills.

The mills below are referred to primarily by their location, secondarily by their popular name(s). The latter one usually coincides with the name of the last owner or sometimes with that of the tenant. 
In several cases, the mill ponds even today retain significant amounts of water. One of the potential reasons is that in the old days, springlets surviving up to the present emerged at the bottom of the then several-meter-deep water.

[[Image:weather-house.jpg|thumb|A '''weather house''' is depicted on this [[New Year's Day]] [[greeting card]] by the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] artist [[Tavik Frantisek Simon]].]]
A '''weather house''' is a [[folk art]] device in the shape of a small [[Germany|German]] or [[Alps|Alpine]] [[chalet]] that indicates the [[weather]].  A typical weather house has two doors side by side.  The left side has a girl or woman, the right side a boy or man.  The female figure comes out of the house when the weather is sunny and dry, while the male comes out to indicate [[rain]].  

==Description==
[[File:Wetterhaeuschen.jpg|thumb|left|Alpine weather house, produced 2015 in Germany.]]
In fact, a weather house functions as a [[hygrometer]] embellished by folk art.  The male and female figures ride on a balance bar, which is suspended by a piece of [[catgut]] or hair.  The gut relaxes or shrinks based on the [[humidity]] in the surrounding air, relaxing when the air is wet and tensing when the air is dry.  This action swings one figure or the other out of the house depending on the humidity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmets.org/education/weatherclub/primary/houses.php Weather houses] at the [[Royal Meteorological Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some variants function as a [[barometer]]: low pressure indicates wrong (rainy) weather, high pressure good (sunny) weather. 

Weather houses are associated in the popular mind with [[Austria]], Germany or [[Switzerland]], and are often decorated in the style of a [[cuckoo clock]].  Many weather houses also bear a small [[thermometer]] on the part between the two doors that conceals the gut suspension, and many also contain a [[piggy bank]]. In contrast, the term "weather house" in the United States refers to buildings built by the U. S. Signal Service and then the U. S. Weather Bureau to house the instruments and Chief Weather Observers so that they could do their job. For more information see the U.S. Weather Bureau.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Cultural influence==
A one-act English comic opera called ''[[Weather or No]]'', about the male and female figures in a weather house falling in love, became popular when it was played as a companion piece to ''[[The Mikado]]'' in 1896-97.

''[[The Brollys]]'' is an animated television series about a boy who is magically transported every night into the weather house on the wall of his bedroom.
