This article is about the grading that is used in [[Hong Kong]].

==Universities==
In Hong Kong, the system of grade point average (GPA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/arro/content.asp?cid=70 Academic Regulations and Records Office - Course Grades]&lt;/ref&gt; is used in [[List of universities in Hong Kong|universities]].

Some universities don't include A+ in the grades,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/iso/calendar/2006-07/english/pdf/p7_04.pdf, section 13.2&lt;/ref&gt; or set the grade point of A+ to be 4.00,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hku.hk/pubunit/cal2006/images/pt16.pdf, section UG5&lt;/ref&gt; so that the maximum GPA attainable is 4.00 instead of 4.30. Some universities use a 12-point based system called "CGA" instead.&lt;ref&gt;http://publish.ust.hk/univ/cal0607/calendar/regu/ugregu.pdf, section 21.4&lt;/ref&gt;  Some universities such as [[The Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] do not include minus grades (i.e., no A-, B-, C-) and the grade point of A+, B+, C+, D+ is 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polyu.edu.hk/as/ERN/ern_explanation.html PolyU GPA system explanation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination and Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination==

Results of the [[Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination]] (HKCEE) and [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]] (HKALE) are expressed in terms of six grades A to F, of which grade A is the highest and F the lowest. Results below grade F are designated as unclassified (UNCL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eant01.hkeaa.edu.hk/hkea/topper.asp?p_coverdown=hkale_home.html HKALE - Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227210609/http://eant01.hkeaa.edu.hk/hkea/topper.asp?p_coverdown=hkale_home.html |date=December 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eant01.hkeaa.edu.hk/hkea/topper.asp?p_coverdown=hkcee_home.html HKCEE - Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227011230/http://eant01.hkeaa.edu.hk/hkea/topper.asp?p_coverdown=hkcee_home.html |date=December 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HKCEE and HKALE will be completely replaced by the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]] Examination in 2013. The last HKCEE were held in 2012 and the last HKALE will be held in 2013 for private candidates only.

===Common grade definition of HKCEE and HKALE recognized by the general public===

* '''Grade A''': Distinction or GCSE/GCE A*
* '''Grade B''': Credit or GCSE/GCE A*/A
* '''Grade C''': Credit or GCSE/GCE A
* '''Grade D''': Pass or GCSE/GCE B
* '''Grade E''': Pass or GCSE/GCE C
* '''Grade F''': Failed
* '''UNCL''': Unclassified

Note:
* Grade C or above in a HKCEE subject is recognised as equivalent to an O-level pass (grade C or better) in an overseas GCE examination. But Grade E in HKCEE is commonly recognized as a pass for most employers and education institutes in Hong Kong.
* Grade E or above in HKALE subject is recognised as equivalent to a pass (Grade E or above) in a British oversea GCE examination.
* Since 2007, HKCEE and HKALE grades could be regarded as 2 grades higher than their IGCSE and UK A-Levels counterparts (e.g. a C in HKALE is comparable to an A in GCE A-levels), except English and Chinese as they are subject to a different comparison standard&lt;ref name="British Council"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.educationuk.org.hk/partnership/website/Equivalence_of_Hong_Kong_qualifications_in_the_UK.pdf |format=pdf |title=Equivalence of Hong Kong qualifications in the UK |deadurl=yes |accessdate=18 May 2013 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008000237/http://www.educationuk.org.hk/partnership/website/Equivalence_of_Hong_Kong_qualifications_in_the_UK.pdf |archive-date=8 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination==
For Category A subjects in HKDSE, results will be expressed in terms of five levels, of which level 5 is the highest and level 1 the lowest. Distinction levels 5** and 5* (pronounced as ''Five-Double-Star'' and ''Five-Star'') will be awarded to the two best-performing groups of candidates attaining Level 5.

'''Albert Dorne''' (February 7, 1906 - December 15, 1965) was an American [[Illustrator]] and entrepreneur, and was co-founder of [[correspondence school]]s for aspiring artists, photographers, and writers. Dorne was co-founder of the Code of Ethics and Fair Practices of the Profession of Commercial Art and Illustration.&lt;ref name="askart"/&gt;

== Biography ==
Dorne was born in the slums of [[New York City]]'s East Side, and had a troubled childhood plagued with [[tuberculosis]] and heart problems.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Watson, E.W. (May 1943). "Albert Dorne," ''American Artist'', vol. 7, #5, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  He would cut classes to study art in the museums, eventually quitting school altogether to support his family. After numerous jobs such as managing a [[newsstand]] and acting as an office boy,&lt;ref name="askart"&gt;[http://www.askart.com/askart/d/albert_dorne/albert_dorne.aspx Dorne entry], AskART.com. Accessed June 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a short [[professional boxing]] career, Dorne began working in advertising.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

He apprenticed as a [[letterer]] with then-letterer and future prominent illustrator [[Saul Tepper]] before beginning a five-year stint at the commercial art studio of Alexander Rice.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; He left the studio to begin a freelance career and soon his illustrations started appearing in such magazines as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'', and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', and by 1943 was featured on the cover of ''American Artist'' magazine, recognized as "one of the best and highest paid in the field of advertising illustration."&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt; He frequently worked for the [[Johnstone and Cushing]] advertising agency.

Dorne was president of the New York [[Society of Illustrators]] in 1947–48. In 1948 he conceived the idea of a [[Distance education|correspondence school]] for art, and recruited eleven other well-known artists and illustrators affiliated with the Society of Illustrators, including [[Norman Rockwell]], to found the [[Famous Artists School]]. In 1961 he helped found the [[Famous Photographers School]] and the [[Famous Writers School]], based on similar principles. All three schools were based in [[Westport, Connecticut]], and by 1963 boasted more than 50,000 students in the U.S. and 54 foreign countries, with a gross income of $10 million.&lt;ref name="askart"/&gt;

Dorne influenced the work of artists including [[John Buscema]]&lt;ref&gt;Spurlock, David J.; Buscema, John (2001). ''John Buscema Sketchbook''. New Jersey: Vanguard Productions. pp. 60–61. {{ISBN|1-887591-18-4}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Avison]],&lt;ref name=Avison&gt;[http://www.askart.com/askart/artist.aspx?artist=134759 Alfred Avison] at Ask Art - The American Artists Bluebook.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051108211850/http://www.askart.com/askart/a/alfred_%28al%29_avison/alfred_%28al%29_avison.aspx |date=November 8, 2005 }}.&lt;!--Unable to archive via WebCitation.org--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Suydam]].&lt;ref name=PenthouseComix&gt;[[Caragonne, George]] (Ed.; November/December 1994). "Suydam", ''[[Penthouse Comix]]'' #4, pp. 85, 86 and 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Dorne donated his pictorial resource file of over 500,000 items to the [[Westport Public Library]]. The collection is still in use today. In 1964, the [[University of Bridgeport]] Department of Art endowed the Albert Dorne Professorship in Drawing.&lt;ref&gt;Almind, Gert J.

The '''Aluu Four lynching''' was a [[necklacing|necklace]] [[lynching]] that involved four young men, Ugonna Obuzor, Toku Lloyd, Chiadika Biringa, and Tekena Elkanah, all students of the [[University of Port Harcourt]]. They were all lynched after they were falsely accused of theft in Aluu, a community in [[Ikwerre, Rivers State|Ikwerre]] local government area, [[Rivers State]], [[Nigeria]] on 5 October 2012.&lt;ref name=mob/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=RD26BwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=aluu+student+killing&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=473|title=Fire &amp; Ashes—Iron &amp; Clay|author=Celia-Joy Martins|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781503503977}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationng.com/2012/10/real-story-behind-the-burning-alive-of-four-uniport-students-in-port-harcourt-yesterday.html|website=Information Nigeria|title=Real Story Behind The Burning Alive Of Four UNIPORT Students In Port Harcourt Yesterday|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
Chiadika Biringa, Lloyd Toku Mike, Tekena Erikena and Ugonna Obuzor were all friends, first sons of their parents, and students of [[University of Port Harcourt]]. The four students were also occasional roommates. Ugonna sometimes spent the night with Tekena who lived outside the campus. He moved in because his residence on campus was broken into multiple times. Ugonna had a debtor called Bright who was owing him some undisclosed amount of money which bothered him much. In time, he managed to find out his particular location. He sought the help of his cousin Lloyd,childhood and longtime friend Tekena and roommate Chiadika.Together, four of them ventured into a journey of no return.The four students finally arrived in the house of the debtor and in the cause of settling the debt, a misunderstanding ensued which turned sour and eventually turned into a fight.

The debtor started screaming, claiming that the men were there to steal laptops and mobile phones. The vigilante group was alerted with the impression that the students were the criminals disturbing the community. The four men were chased through the streets by the stick and stone-wielding vigilantes, stripped naked, beaten and tortured until they were almost unconscious. Afterwards, in the presence of a crowd, they were dragged through mud, had concrete slabs dropped on their heads and car tyres filled with petrol wrapped around their necks in order to burn them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elombah.com/index.php/write-for-us/12834-the-true-story-about-the-4-murdered-uniport-students|website=Elombah|title=The true story about the 4 Murdered Uniport students|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sister of Tekena was nearby and discovered that her brother was about to be killed via "[[jungle justice]]." She tried to intervene and rescue him with his friends by screaming at the top of her voice at the mob and reiterating their innocence but she was overpowered by the size of the mob. People from the mob told her to flee. In a last attempt to save her brother's life, she decided to contact other family members and the police, but the men had been killed by the time the required assistance was sought. The murders were filmed with a [[mobile phone]] and uploaded on the [[internet]].&lt;ref name="mob" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sunnewsonline.com/new/aluu-4-i-watched-them-kill-my-brother-tekenas-sister/|title=Aluu 4: I watched them kill my brother – Tekena’s sister|date=October 12, 2012|author=Tony John|publisher=The Sun|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daily" /&gt;

==Reactions==
The video went [[Viral video|viral]], with most viewers condemning the crime. Condolences were sent to the families of the victims. The Senate condemned the jungle justice that members of the community carried out where the four students were hurriedly murdered without trial in the presence of a crowd. Students of the University protested the murders and went on rampage by rioting and destroying properties in the community where the students had been lynched.

==Aftermath==
The lynching was widely viewed in Nigeria and the rest of the world. The crime further exposed the "[[jungle justice]]" or "mob justice"' which was still prevalent in Nigeria, as well as exposed some loopholes in Nigeria's law enforcement system. Several people were arrested in connection with the crime.&lt;ref name=mob&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/26/world/africa/nigeria-mob-justice-duthiers/|publisher=CNN|title=Did misunderstanding lead to horrific Nigeria mob killings?|author=Vladimir Duthiers|date=November 26, 2012|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daily&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2239201/Necklace-lynchings-shocked-Africa-Agonising-deaths-students-mistaken-thieves-burned-alive-posted-online.html|title='Necklace' lynchings that shocked Africa: Agonising deaths of four students who were burned alive is posted online|date=November 27, 2012|author=Matt Blake|publisher=Daily Mail|location=United Kingdom|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osundefender.org/?p=189842|website=Osun defender|title=Aluu 4 Killing: Is Justice Dead In Nigeria???

The '''American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese''' is a language-specific [[professional association]] in the [[United States]] that was founded on December 29, 1917 in [[New York City]] as the American Association of Teachers of Spanish.
The name was changed to the present one when Portuguese was added to the association's mission in 1944.

The organization is composed of more than 8,800 members in 60 chapters across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

== Mission statement ==
The mission statement of the association is to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;promote ... the study and teaching of Hispanic, Luso-Brazilian, and other related languages, literatures, and cultures at all educational levels. Through an exchange of pedagogical and scholarly information, the AATSP encourages heritage and second-language study and supports projects to that end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aatsp.org/?page=MissionStatement  AATSP Official Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History and organization ==
The Association was founded in 1917 largely through the efforts of Lawrence A. Wilkins, its first President, who worked with a number of individuals teaching in colleges, universities, and high schools along the Eastern Seaboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aatsp.org/?page=History AATSP History]&lt;/ref&gt; Aurelio M. Espinosa, later the first editor of '''''[[Hispania (journal)|Hispania]]''''', helped Wilkins to unite the previously existing east and west coast Spanish teachers' initiatives to form the national association.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Donald Devenish. ''Hispania'', Vol. 50, No. 4, Fiftieth Anniversary Issue (Dec. 1967) p. 823-833&lt;/ref&gt; The AATSP was the first association in the United States devoted to the study of a specific modern foreign language, pre-dating the AATI (1923), the [[American Association of Teachers of French|AATF]] (French) (1927), and the [[American Association of Teachers of German|AATG]] (German)  (1927).

Membership has always been open to teachers of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and all others interested in the languages. There are Honorary Members and Fellows who represent, respectively, the world of [[Hispanic]] and [[Luso-Brazilian]] scholarship and the world of letters.

=== Governing body ===
The governing body of AATSP is an Executive Council (EC) which consists of an executive director, a president, a president-elect, and the past president. There is an elected representative from the college or university and high school levels. In addition, there is a rotating body of elected members every three years of three members, one from a community college, one from Foreign Language in the Elementary Schools (FLES), and one from Portuguese.

The Executive Council meets once a year face-to-face at the annual conference, through numerous conference calls, and regularly through online meetings via email. There is a business meeting at the annual conference through which all members can express their concerns to the EC. There are also standing committees for Portuguese, FLES, award selection, scholarship selection, and nominations.

== Services ==

=== Annual conference ===
An annual conference has been held each year since 1917 with the exception of two years during [[World War II]] when government restrictions prohibited such gatherings. Each annual conference consists of a wide range of sessions, numerous workshops for members, and many social activities designed to augment the camaraderie of members. In the 21st century, meetings have been held in [[Albuquerque]], [[San José, Costa Rica]], [[San Diego]], [[Salamanca, Spain]],  [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], and [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]].

=== Career center ===
The AATSP offers employment opportunity information to its members by way of an online career center. This interactive tool allows job seekers to search for jobs based on their personal criteria and allows employers from school districts, colleges, and universities to announce job openings.

=== Publications ===
'''''[[Hispania (journal)|Hispania]]''''' is the official journal of the AATSP. From its inception, it was envisioned as a scholarly publication and also as a source of practical advice for classroom teachers. It features articles on [[literature]], [[language]], theoretical and applied [[linguistics]], cultural studies, and book and media reviews. It has steadily grown in prestige and has had 12 editors through the years; the present editor is Dr. Sheri Spaine Long of [[University of Alabama]] at Birmingham. Publications are in March, June, September, and December. '''''[[Hispania (journal)|Hispania]]''''' is a member of the Council of Editors of Learned Journals.

'''''Enlace''''' is the AATSP's online newsletter that contains timely articles of interest to members. '''''The Portuguese Newsletter''''' features items of interest about the Luso-Brazilian world. They are both published in the spring and fall.

=== Scholarships and awards ===
There are three categories of scholarships AATSP offers. The first is a "First-Time-Attendee" travel stipend for the annual conference. There are ten $500 stipends offered which are distributed to faculty members and to graduate students. Applicants must be a member of AATSP at the time of application, a teacher of Spanish and/or Portuguese K-16, and a first time attendee at an AATSP annual meeting.

There are also scholarships for study abroad programs in [[Costa Rica]], [[Mexico]], and the Andean countries of [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]]. The study abroad programs provide scholarships and the AATSP supplements the scholarship with a $750 travel stipend. Applicants must be an AATSP member for three consecutive years, a full-time Spanish teacher for three years, and continue to teach Spanish for an academic year following the scholarship experience.

The Robert G. Mead, Jr. Travel and Study/Research Stipend is a $1,000.00 travel stipend made possible through the contributions of friends of Professor Mead and his widow Harriet. Applicants must travel and conduct research in a Luso-Hispanic country and be a student member of AATSP for two years or a regular member for three years.

The AATSP accepts nominations from its members for individuals who have done outstanding work in the promotion of foreign language education in Spanish and Portuguese. Awards include Outstanding Teacher of the Year, Outstanding Service, Chapter Incentive, Robert G. Mead, Jr. Distinguished Leadership, Maria Isabel Abreu, and ISE Language Matters. More information is available on the official AATSP website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aatsp.org/?page=AwardsDescript  AATSP Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student involvement ==

=== FLES poster contest ===
Each year the AATSP sponsors a poster contest for all students enrolled in Spanish or Portuguese in grades K-8 of AATSP members in good standing. It is an excellent opportunity to discuss language learning with younger learners. The contest is a great classroom activity and program advocacy tool providing student recognition.

=== Honor Societies ===
The '''[[Sociedad Honoraria Hispánica]]''' (SHH) was established in 1952 as a service-oriented honors society for select students of Spanish. It has long published an official newsletter for its sponsors, ''¡Albricias!'', which includes poetry, short pieces, illustrations, and photography created by the students themselves. There are more than 1800 chapters and the number of initiates grows each year. A club for elementary and middle school students, the Sociedad Hispánica de Amistad (SHA), was formed in 2001. Judith Park and Ursula Sihocky direct the SHH and Pamela Wink directs the SHA.

=== National Examinations ===
The '''[[National Spanish Examinations]]''' (NSE) are web-based, standardized assessment tools for Grades 6–-12, given voluntarily by over 3400 teachers throughout the United States to measure proficiency and achievement of students who are studying Spanish as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalspanishexam.org  National Spanish Examinations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Portuguese Examinations''' (NPE) are communicative proficiency-based tools that engage the students in reading, speaking, and writing. They are intended for High School students of Portuguese.

'''Andrea Palladio''' ({{IPA-it|anˈdrɛːa palˈlaːdjo}}; 30 November 1508&amp;nbsp;– 19 August 1580) was an [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; architect active in the [[Venetian Republic]]. Palladio, influenced by [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]], primarily by [[Vitruvius]], is widely considered to be one of the most influential individuals in the [[Architectural history|history of architecture]]. All of his buildings are located in what was the Venetian Republic, but his teachings, summarized in the architectural treatise, ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura|The Four Books of Architecture]]'', gained him wide recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladio.html His conception of classical architecture was heavily influenced by Vitruvian ideas and his mentor Trissino. "Andrea Palladio."]&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Vicenza]], with its twenty-three buildings designed by Palladio, and the [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto]] are listed together as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

==Biography==
Palladio was born on 30 November 1508 in [[Padua]] and was given the name, Andrea Di Pietro della Gondola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Houghton Mifflin dictionary of biography |page=1167 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]|isbn=0-618-25210-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfesntdNnbwC&amp;lpg=PA1167&amp;pg=PA1167#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Pietro, called "Della Gondola", was a miller. From early on, Andrea Palladio was introduced into the work of building. In Padua he gained his first experiences as a stonecutter in the sculpture workshop of Bartolomeo Cavazza da Sossano, who was the sculptor responsible for the altar in the Church of Santa Maria dei Carmini in Padua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moose|first1=editor, Christina J.|title=Great lives from history.|date=2005|publisher=Salem Press|location=Pasadena, Calif.|isbn=978-1-58765-211-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavazza da Sossano is said to have imposed particularly hard working conditions. At the age of sixteen he moved to Vicenza where he would reside for most of his life. Here he became an assistant in the Pedemuro studio, a leading workshop of stonecutters and masons. He joined a guild of stonemasons and bricklayers. He was employed as a stonemason to make monuments and decorative sculptures. These sculptures reflected the [[Mannerist]] style of the architect [[Michele Sanmicheli]].

Perhaps the key moment that sparked Palladio's career was being employed by the Humanist poet and scholar, [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], from 1538 to 1539. While Trissino was reconstructing the Villa Cricoli, he took interest in Palladio's work. Trissino was heavily influenced by the studies of Vitruvius, who later influenced Palladio's own ideals and attitudes toward classical architecture. As the leading intellectual in Vicenza, Trissino stimulated the young man to appreciate the arts, sciences, and Classical literature and he granted him the opportunity to study Ancient architecture in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;He visited Rome alongside Trissino in 1541, 1547, and 1554 until 1556. His earlier visits to Rome influenced his designs of palaces. He modeled his designs based on his interpretation of classical architecture he had witnessed. Curl, James Stevens, "A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture", [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Trissino who gave him the name by which he became known, Palladio, an allusion to the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of wisdom [[Athena|Pallas Athene]] and to a character of a play by Trissino. Indeed, the word Palladio means ''Wise one''.&lt;ref&gt;"How I Spent A Few Days in Palladio's World" ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 3 March 2009, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123603460173214171?mod=article-outset-box WSJ.com]&lt;/ref&gt; After Trissino's death in 1550, Palladio benefited from the patronage of the Barbaro brothers, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Daniele Barbaro]], who encouraged his studies of [[classical architecture]] and brought him to Rome in 1554, and his younger brother [[Marcantonio Barbaro]]. The powerful Barbaros introduced Palladio to [[Venice]], where he finally became "Proto della Serenissima" (chief architect of the Republic of Venice) after [[Jacopo Sansovino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mostra del Palladio: Vicenza / Basilica Palladiana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUk3AQAAIAAJ|year=1973|publisher=Electa|page=46|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Barbaros, the Corner, [[Foscari]], and [[Pisani family|Pisani]] families supported Palladio's career.&lt;ref&gt;''Venice and the Renaissance", Manfredo Tafuri, trans. Jessica Levine, 1989, [[MIT Press]], p.127 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BYaBnsP5PMC Books.Google.com] {{ISBN|0-262-70054-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio began to develop his own architectural style around 1541. The [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]], named after him, adhered to classical [[Roman architecture|Roman]] principles he rediscovered, applied, and explained in his works.&lt;ref&gt;Palladio knew relatively little about Greek architecture, not yet rediscovered at his times, but he studied deeply the Roman remains during five trips to Rome. His works are heavily influenced by his studies of Greco-Roman architecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio is known to be one of the most influential architects in Western architecture. His architectural works have "been valued for centuries as the quintessence of High Renaissance calm and harmony" (Watkin, D., ''A History of Western Architecture''). He designed many palaces, [[villa]]s, and churches, but Palladio's reputation, initially, and after his death, has been founded on his skill as a designer of villas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Burns]], [http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&amp;sezione=4&amp;lingua=e ''Andrea Palladio (1508–1580)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924065640/http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&amp;sezione=4&amp;lingua=e |date=24 September 2009 }}, [[Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[palladian villas]] are located mainly in the [[province of Vicenza]], while the ''[[palazzo|palazzi]]'' are concentrated in the city of [[Vicenza]] and the churches in [[Venice]]. A number of his works are now protected as part of the [[World Heritage Site]] ''[[City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto]]''. Other buildings by Palladio are to be found within the ''Venice and its Lagoon'' World Heritage Site.

Palladio's first major public project began when his designs for building the [[loggia]]s for the town hall, known as the [[Basilica Palladiana]], were approved in 1548. He proposed an addition of two-storey stone buttresses reflecting the Gothic style of the existing hall while using classical proportions. The construction was completed in 1617 after Palladio's death.

Aside from Palladio's designs, his publications contributed to ''[[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]]''. During the second half of his life, Palladio published many books, above all, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (''The four books of architecture'', Venice, 1570). Palladio is most known for his designs of villas and palaces as well as his books.

The precise circumstances of his death are unknown. Palladio died in 1580,&lt;ref name="Avcioglu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr Nebahat Avcioglu|title=Architecture, Art and Identity in Venice and its Territories, 1450–1750: Essays in Honour of Deborah Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOL9i4VXrtkC&amp;pg=PA150|date=23 December 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4724-1082-5|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; retold in tradition, in [[Maser, Italy|Maser]], near [[Treviso]], and was buried in the church of [[Santa Corona]] in Vicenza; since the nineteenth century his tomb has been located in the ''Cimitero Maggiore'' of Vicenza.

Palladio's architecture was not dependent on expensive materials, which must have been an advantage to his more financially pressed clients. Many of his buildings are of brick covered with [[stucco]]. Stuccoed brickwork was always used in his villa designs in order to portray his interpretations of the Roman villa typology.

In the later part of his career, Palladio was chosen by powerful members of Venetian society for numerous important commissions. His success as an architect is based not only on the beauty of his work, but also for its harmony with the culture of his time. His success and influence came from the integration of extraordinary aesthetic quality with expressive characteristics that resonated with his client's social aspirations. His buildings served to communicate, visually, their place in the social order of their culture. This powerful integration of beauty and the physical representation of social meanings is apparent in three major building types: the urban palazzo, the agricultural villa, and the church.

Relative to his trips to Rome, Palladio developed three main palace types by 1556. In 1550, the [[Palazzo Chiericati]] was completed. The proportions for the building were based on musical ratios for adjacent rooms. The building was centralized by a tripartite division of a series of columns or colonnades. In 1552, the [[Palazzo Porto|Palazzo Iseppo Porto]] located in Vicenza was rebuilt incorporating the Roman Renaissance element for façades. A colonnade of Corinthian columns surrounded a main court. The [[Palazzo Antonini]] in Udine, constructed in 1556, had a centralized hall with four columns and service spaces placed relatively toward one side. He uses styles of incorporating the six columns, supported by pediments, into the walls as part of the façade. This technique had been applied in his villa designs as well. Palladio experimented with the plan of the Palazzo Iseppo Porto by incorporating it into the [[Palazzo Thiene]]. It was an earlier project from 1545 to 1550 and remained uncompleted due to elaborate elevations in his designs. He used Mannerist elements such as stucco surface reliefs and large columns, often extending two stories high.

In his urban structures he developed a new improved version of the typical early [[Renaissance]] palazzo (exemplified by the [[Palazzo Strozzi]]). Adapting a new urban palazzo type created by [[Bramante]] in the [[House of Raphael]], Palladio found a powerful expression of the importance of the owner and his social position. The main living quarters of the owner on the second level were clearly distinguished in importance by use of a [[pediment]]ed classical [[portico]], centered and raised above the subsidiary and utilitarian ground level (illustrated in the [[Palazzo Porto]] and the [[Palazzo Valmarana]]). The tallness of the portico was achieved by incorporating the owner's sleeping quarters on the third level, within a [[Giant order|giant]] two-story classical colonnade, a motif adapted from [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Capitoline]] buildings in Rome. The elevated main floor level became known as the "[[piano nobile]]", and is still referred to as the "first floor" in Europe.

[[File:Monument to Andrea Palladio (Vicenza).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Palladio in Vicenza]]
Palladio also established an influential new building format for the agricultural villas of the Venetian [[aristocracy]]. Palladio's approach to his villa designs was not relative to his experience in Rome. His designs were based on practicality and employed few reliefs. He consolidated the various stand-alone farm outbuildings into a single impressive structure, arranged as a highly organized whole, dominated by a strong center and symmetrical side wings, as illustrated at [[Villa Barbaro]]. In the project of the Villa Barbaro, Palladio most likely was also engaged in the interior decoration. Alongside the painter [[Paolo Veronese]], he invented the complex and sophisticated illusionistic landscape paintings that cover the walls of various rooms.&lt;ref&gt;For the illusionistic landscape paintings and the relationship of Palladio and Veronese see http://www.kunstgeschichte-ejournal.net/329/1/Paolo_Veronese%2C_Andrea_Palladio_und_die_Stanza_di_Baco.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Villa Rotonda]] of 1552, outside Vicenza, was constructed as a summer house with views from all four sides. The plan has centralized circular halls with wings and porticos expanding on all four sides. Palladio began to implement the classical temple front into his design of façades for villas. He felt that to make an entry appear grand, the Roman temple front would be the most suitable style. The Palladian villa configuration often consists of a centralized block raised on an elevated [[podium]], accessed by grand steps, and flanked by lower service wings, as at [[Villa Foscari]] and [[Villa Badoer]]. This format, with the quarters of the owners at the elevated center of their own world, found resonance as a prototype for Italian villas and later for the country estates of the British nobility (such as [[Lord Burlington]]'s [[Chiswick House]], Vanbrugh's [[Blenheim Palace|Blenheim]], Walpole's [[Houghton Hall]], and Adam's [[Kedleston Hall]] and [http://www.paxtonhouse.co.uk/ Paxton House] in Scotland). His villas were used by a capitalist gentry who developed an interest in agriculture and land. The configuration was a perfect architectural expression of their worldview, clearly expressing their perceived position in the social order of the times. His influence was extended worldwide into the [[British colonies]]. Palladio developed his own prototype for the plan of the villas that was flexible to moderate in scale and function. The Palladian villa format was easily adapted for a democratic worldview, as may be seen at [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]] and his arrangement for the [[University of Virginia]]. It also may be seen applied as recently as 1940 in Pope's [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]] in Washington D.C., where the public entry to the world of high culture occupies the exalted center position. The [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] of exposed [[basement]] walls of Victorian residences is a late remnant of the Palladian format, clearly expressed as a podium for the main living space for the family.

Similarly, Palladio created a new configuration for the design of [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] churches that established two interlocking architectural orders, each clearly articulated, yet delineating a hierarchy of a larger order overriding a lesser order. This idea was in direct coincidence with the rising acceptance of the theological ideas of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], who postulated the notion of two worlds existing simultaneously: the divine world of faith, and the earthly world of humans.  Palladio created an architecture which made a visual statement communicating the idea of two superimposed systems, as illustrated at [[San Francesco della Vigna]]. In a time when religious dominance in Western culture was threatened by the rising power of science and [[secular humanism|secular humanists]], this architecture found great favor with the Catholic Church as a clear statement of the proper relationship of the earthly and the spiritual worlds.

==Influence==
[[File:Palladio Titel 1642.jpg|thumb|upright|The front page of ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture)]]

[[File:Frontispiece Campbell's edition of Palladio's First Book of Architecture 1728.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] from [[Colen Campbell]]'s edition of Palladio's ''First Book of Architecture'', published at London, 1728]]

Although his buildings are all in a relatively small part of Italy, Palladio's influence was far-reaching. One factor in the spread of his influence was the publication in 1570 of his architectural treatise, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture), which set out rules others could follow. The first book includes studies of decorative styles, classical orders, and materials. The second book included Palladio's town and country house designs and classical reconstructions. The third book has bridge and basilica designs, city planning designs, and classical halls. The fourth book included information on the reconstruction of ancient Roman temples. Before this landmark publication, architectural drawings by Palladio had appeared in print as illustrations to [[Daniele Barbaro]]'s "Commentary" on [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Clini "Vitruvius' Basilica at Fano: The drawings of a lost building from 'De Architectura Libri Decem'" The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Vol. XXXIV, Part 5/W12 pp121 – 126 2002 [http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf ISPRS.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517124924/http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf |date=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in his style was renewed in later generations and became fashionable throughout Europe, for example in parts of the [[Loire Valley]] of France. In Britain, [[Inigo Jones]], [[Elizabeth Wilbraham]], and [[Christopher Wren]] embraced the Palladian style. In his [[Italian Journey]], [[Johann von Goethe]] describes Palladio as a genius, commending his unfinished Convent of Saint Maria della Carita as the most perfect existing work of architecture. Another admirer was the architect, [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]], 4th [[Earl of Cork]], also known as [[Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], who, with [[William Kent]], designed [[Chiswick House]]. The influence of Palladio even spread to America. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Thomas Dawes]] much admired that style of architecture, and the United States Capitol building is an example of a slightly evolved version of Palladio's works. The One Hundred Eleventh [[Congress of the United States of America]] called him the "Father of American Architecture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcadoc.it/english/news/Palladio-Father-of-American-Architecture.htm|title=The US Congress: 'Palladio, the Father of American Architecture'|website=www.marcadoc.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Congressional Resolution no. 259 of 6 December 2010). Exponents of Palladianism include the eighteenth century [[Venice|Venetian]] architect, [[Giacomo Leoni]], who published an authoritative four-volume work on Palladio and his architectural concepts.

More than 330 of Palladio's original drawings and sketches still survive in the collections of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx Collecting Palladio's drawings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926192605/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx |date=26 September 2009 }}, website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; most of which originally were owned by Inigo Jones.

[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], a nonprofit membership organization, was founded in 1979 to research and promote understanding of Palladio's influence in the architecture of the United States.

In 2010, the [[National Building Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] created an exhibition dedicated solely to Palladio and his legacy. The exhibition, titled ''Palladio and His Legacy: A Transatlantic Journey'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/palladio-and-his-legacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710002925/http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/palladio-and-his-legacy.html |archivedate=10 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was open to the public until January 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6552">'''Arturo Buzzi-Peccia''' (13 October 1854&amp;nbsp;– 29 August 1943) was an Italian singing instructor and song composer.

==Biography==
Buzzi-Peccia was born 13 October 1854 in [[Milan]], Italy, to Antonio and Clotilde Peccia.&lt;ref name=Donati/&gt; In 1868, he was accepted at the [[Milan Conservatory]] where he studied composition under [[Antonio Bazzini]].  In the late 1870s, he went to Paris to continue his studies under [[Massenet]] and [[Saint-Saëns]]. He returned to Italy, first to Milan and eventually taking a position in [[Turin]] as a voice teacher.&lt;ref name=Donati/&gt;

He began to write music while still in school, and composed three works to secure his diploma from the Milan Conservatory in 1875. In 1886 his ''{{lang|it|Visione e Baccanale romano}}'' was performed at [[La Scala]].  His [[symphonic poem]] ''{{lang|it|Re Harfagar}}'' received critical acclaim when it premiered at La Scala in 1888.&lt;ref name=Donati/&gt;  The 1897 premiere in Turin of Buzzi-Peccia's only opera, ''{{lang|it|Forza d'Amore}}'', was conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]].&lt;ref name=Toscanini2006/&gt;  One of his best-known works is "Lolita: Serenata spagnola" (1892), recorded by many singers over the years including [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Titta Ruffo]], and [[Franco Corelli]]. His {{lang|it|"Mal d'Amore"}} was sung by [[Joseph Schmidt]] in the 1934 film ''[[My Song Goes Round the World]]''. Most of his songs were written in Italian, but he also wrote lyrics in French and English.  His most famous novelty song, {{lang|fr|"[[La Cigarette du Paradis]]"}} (Song of the Cigarette), was written in French.

He came to the United States in 1898 to teach voice at the [[Chicago Musical College]] with references from such notables as [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and [[Arrigo Boito]].&lt;ref name=Music/&gt;  Two years later Buzzi-Peccia moved to New York to teach at the [[American Institute of Applied Music|Metropolitan College of Music]].&lt;ref name=Donati/&gt; He was the first voice teacher of [[Alma Gluck]],&lt;ref name=Cooke1921/&gt; and also of [[Sophie Braslau]].&lt;ref name=James1971/&gt;  Another pupil of Buzzi-Peccia was the poet [[Dorothy Caruso]], wife of Enrico Caruso.{{efn|Buzzi-Peccia set some of her verses to music, and Caruso sang them.}}{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In addition to Caruso, many artists recorded Buzzi-Peccia's songs, among them [[Beniamino Gigli]], [[Carlo Bergonzi]], [[Mario Lanza]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Giuseppe Di Stefano]], and [[Roberto Alagna]].

==Gameplay==

===Summary===
A lot of strategy is used when players have to make [[Discernment|decisions]] and [[negotiation|negotiate]]. Messages always arrive using the [[data feed]] style to make the game more business-like. The [[game over|game can end]] with a loss if the wrong decision is made at the wrong time (similar to dying in an [[action game]]). The player will have to deal with [[loan shark]]s in the Caribbean, ruthless corporate executives from rival companies, [[arbitration]] sessions, and components that make the game look more like a [[strategy video game|strategy game]] at times. There are no items to use and very little action (with moving the guy around a virtual office building).

===Actions===
* みる (見る) Look
* かんがえる (考える) Think
* はなす (話す) Talk
* のむ (飲む) Drink
* でんわ (電話) Telephone

'''Chicago College of Performing Arts''' or '''CCPA''' is a [[performing arts]] [[college]] that is housed at [[Roosevelt University]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. While CCPA is officially a part of Roosevelt University, CCPA (both the institution and its students) has its own distinct personality. The relationship between the two is much like that of the Eastman School of Music and The University of Rochester or The College-Conservatory of Music and the University of Cincinnati. The college has two divisions: [[The Music Conservatory of Chicago College of Performing Arts|the Music Conservatory]] and [[The Theatre Conservatory of Chicago College of Performing Arts|the Theatre Conservatory]]. Nearly 600 students come from more than 40 states and 25 countries to study at CCPA. The faculty consists primarily of world class professional actors, directors and musicians, including nearly 30 members of the [[Chicago Symphony]] and the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] (half of whom are principals) and theatre performers with credits from Broadway to Chicago and the West Coast.

== History ==

Chicago Musical College was founded in 1867, less than four decades after the city of Chicago was incorporated. It has given over a hundred years of uninterrupted service to music and music education and has played an important role in the development of the cultural life of the [[Midwest]].

In 1865, after initial efforts to establish a college of music, the Chicago Conservatorium of Music was founded, with Florenz Ziegfeld, Sr. as its director. (Ziegfeld Sr. was the father of [[Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.|Florenz, Jr.]], who is better known as a successful and trail-blazing Broadway impresario.)

Two years later, in 1867, Ziegfeld established his own Chicago Academy of Music, the fourth conservatory in America. In 1871, the conservatory moved to a new building which was destroyed only a few weeks later by the Great Chicago Fire; despite the conflagration, the College was again up and running by the end of the year.

In 1872, the school changed its name to Chicago Musical College; over 900 students were enrolled in that year. A Normal Teachers' Institute was added to the school's offerings. Tuition in those far-off days cost an average of one dollar per lesson. Four years later the State of Illinois accredited the College as a degree granting institution of higher learning. A Preparatory Division was opened which established branches throughout the city.

[[Rudolph Ganz]] joined CMC's faculty in 1900 and, except for a brief hiatus in the 1920s, remained associated with the school until his death in 1972. In 1917, CMC offered a Master of Music Degree, and seven years later the School became a charter member of the [[National Association of Schools of Music]].

By 1925, the College moved into its own eleven-story building at 64 E. Van Buren Street. One hundred and twenty-five names appeared on the faculty roster for that year, and the School opened three dormitory floors for students. In 1936, CMC was admitted as a full member to the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the only independent music college in the Midwest to enjoy such status. By 1947 the College was offering Doctorates in Fine Arts and Music Education.

In 1954, CMC merged with Roosevelt University's School of Music which was founded in 1945. The name "Chicago Musical College" was retained for the new college which was created by the union of the two schools. All operations moved to join the University in the now national landmark Auditorium Building at 430 South Michigan Avenue in Chicago's Loop. The building houses one of the finest auditoriums in the world, in addition to the Rudolph Ganz Memorial Recital Hall.

In the fall of 1997 Roosevelt established a College of Performing Arts which joined Chicago Musical College and the Theater Program under one administrative unit. In 2000, under the leadership of new dean James Gandre, the name was changed to Chicago College of Performing Arts. Rudy Marcozzi acted as Interim Dean during the 2008-2009 school year until Henry Fogel, the former President of the Chicago Symphony, assumed the post of Dean of CCPA in the Fall of 2009. Linda Berna is the Associate Dean/Director of the Music Conservatory, and Sean Kelley is the Associate Dean/Director of the Theatre Conservatory

== Ganz Hall ==

Ganz Hall was originally conceived as a banquet hall for the Auditorium Hotel after the building had already been constructed in 1890. Louis Sullivan, the architect of the building, was faced with trying to build a new large space within the world's largest mixed-use high-rise building. The only area available for constructing a room for banqueting was above the [[Auditorium Theatre]].

The two primary innovations of the project were to design a special support system for a two-story structure and bring about a refined space capable of formal dining. First, Sullivan worked closely with his partner and structural engineer, Dankmar Adler, to develop a system of iron trusses. The entire frame of the building was constructed to span across the top of the Theatre similar to the long spans of bridge design. This was the first innovation of the project.

The Banquet Hall, entered from the seventh floor of the hotel, is a fine example of the refinement of the ornamentation, the second innovation. Sullivan used a unique and distinctive system of ornamentation such as carved wood panels and capitals, stenciled wall patterns, elaborate plaster work, gilded lighting fixtures, and the use of Michigan birch and gold leaf - all of which made the interior striking. A young apprentice working for Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, had obtained much responsibility at the time and designed some of the ornament.

The ornament is quite intricate and well-developed. The columns are large tapered-over scaled piers with rounded corners from which the ornament "appears" from the grain of the wood. The piers were a modern expression of the time because Sullivan stripped away all the traditional Victorian details in lieu of a simple oversized design.

== Alterations ==

Around 1912, the Banquet Hall was used as a Masonic Lodge. The Masons made several alterations. The musicians' gallery at the north end of the hall was removed. A balcony was installed at the rear of the hall. They also sealed the center pair of doors, removed three of the stained glass windows, and painted the remaining windows black. The stencils were painted over and acoustical tiles were applied to the face of the beams.

In 1956, Chicago Musical College of Roosevelt University obtained the Hall. Many of the Masons' alterations were eliminated and the Hall was restored and converted to a recital hall. Under the direction of architect Crombie Taylor, the goal of restoring the room as closely as possible to the original ornamentation while providing an attractive hall for music recitals was begun. A stage and fixed theatre seating were installed to achieve this function. The majority of stencil patterns were recovered. Today, reproductions of the stencils remain on the back wall and in one of the arches as originally designed by Sullivan. However, some of the work that was planned, such as the stenciling on the beams and walls, and installing the ornamental light fixtures, was not completed at that time. 

In 1980, architect John Vinci completed a project that helped control the environmental effects on the hall. A new roof and exterior wall system were installed along with new windows and skylights. Water that had been seeping into the Hall was eliminated. This was the beginning of keeping the Hall intact without further damage.

Work continues to restore the hall to its former splendor and provide adequately for use of the space as a recital hall. In 2001 the paintings lining the walls were removed and restored at the Art Institute. In the fall of 2002 the "electroliers" were recreated and installed, as well as a new HVAC system.

==Faculty==

The Faculty of CCPA is made of many musicians from both the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Chicago Lyric Opera]] as well as other world class musicians from around the world. Notable teachers include [[Vadim Gluzman]], [[Shmuel Ashkenasi]], [[Robert Chen]](Concertmaster of the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]]), [[Liu Yang (violinist)|Liu Yang]], [[Tanya Carey]], [[Michael Holmes (saxophonist)|Michael Holmes]], Richard Hirschl, David Schrader, John Sharp (Principal cellist of the Chicago Symphony), Denis Azabagic (classical guitar), Paul Wertico, Wendy Warner, [[Eugene Izotov]], (Principal oboe of the Chicago Symphony), [[Dale Clevenger]] (Principal horn of the Chicago Symphony). 
Voice and [[Opera]] faculty includes personalities such as: Scott Gilmore, Dr. Dana Brown, [[Samuel Ramey]], [[Richard Stillwell]], Judith Haddon, Allan Glassman, [[Jonita Lattimore]], [[Nicole Cabell]], Bruce Hall, Tom Studebaker, [[Cynthia Clarey]] and many other legendary musicians.

The '''Duke-UNC China Leadership Summit''' (CLS) is an annual student conference that brings together distinguished student leaders and eminent individuals in the fields of academia, politics and business to examine the rise of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/index.php/article/2011/02/china_leadership_summit_unites_duke_unc | title=China Leadership Summit unites Duke, UNC | publisher=''[[The Daily Tar Heel]]'' | accessdate=March 28, 2013 | author=Seligson, Paula}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by student conferences like [[The Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations]] and the Forum for American/Chinese Exchange at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], CLS is the first conference of its kind in the southern [[United States]]. Established in 2010 with the goal of providing sustained collaboration between students and faculty at [[Duke University]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and to connect students in the [[Research Triangle]] to innovative research and professional development opportunities in field of [[US-China relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2011/02/28/conference-builds-skills-us-china-understanding | title=Conference builds skills for US-China understanding | publisher=''[[The Chronicle (Duke University)|The Chronicle]]'' | date=February 28, 2011 | accessdate=March 28, 2013 | author=Zempolich, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has grown to host over 100 delegates from across the US and China.

In 2012, the Duke-UNC China Leadership Summit established a working relationship with [[Wuhan University]] and sponsored [[Wuhan]] students to attend the second annual Summit. The partnership arose out of Duke University's partnership with [[Wuhan University]] and the city of [[Kunshan]] on [[Duke Kunshan University]] (DKU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://academiccouncil.duke.edu/duke-in-china/ | title=Duke in China | publisher=''The Academic Council of Duke University'' | accessdate=March 28, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405222108/http://academiccouncil.duke.edu/duke-in-china/ | archivedate=April 5, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the 2012 CLS that the Managing Director of DKU Nora Bynum announced that DKU programs will start in 2013, one year later than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2012/03/19/dku-programs-now-begin-fall-2013 | title=DKU programs now to begin Fall 2013 | publisher=''The Chronicle'' | date=March 19, 2012 | accessdate=March 28, 2013 | author=Carroll, Lauren}}&lt;/ref&gt; CLS 2012 received sponsorship from the prestigious Kenan-Biddle Grant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2011/11/30/duke-unc-partnership-funds-10-joint-projects | title=Duke-UNC partnership funds 10 joint projects | publisher=''The Chronicle'' | date=November 30, 2011 | accessdate=March 28, 2013 | author=Mo, Shucao}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was able to offer admission to non Duke and UNC Students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://web.duke.edu/apsi/about/Newsletters/newsletter_march2012.pdf | title=Duke - UNC China Leadership Summit | journal=''The Asian/Pacific Studies Institute'' | year=2011-12 | issue=8 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fair, Accurate, Inclusive, and Respectful Education Act''', also known as the '''FAIR Education Act''' (Senate Bill 48) and informally described by media outlets as the '''LGBT History Bill''', is a California law which compels the inclusion of the political, economic, and social contributions of persons with [[disabilities]] and [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender]] people into educational textbooks and the social studies curricula in California public schools by amending the California Education Code. It also revises the previous designation of "black Americans, American Indians, Mexicans, Asians, [and] Pacific Island people" in that list into "[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[African Americans]], [[Mexican Americans]], [[Asian Americans]], [[Pacific Islanders]], and [[European Americans]]". It would also amend an existing law by adding [[sexual orientation]] and [[religion]] into a list of characteristics (which already includes [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[gender]], and [[disability]]) that schools are prohibited from sponsoring negative activities about or teaching students about in an adverse way.

In particular, according to chief author Sen. [[Mark Leno]], it "ensures that the historical contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are accurately and fairly portrayed in instructional materials by adding LGBT people to the existing list of under-represented cultural and ethnic groups already included in the state’s inclusionary education requirements."

The bill was introduced into the Senate on December 13, 2010, and was finally passed 23-14 on April 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/14/politics/main20054063.shtml|title = Calif. Senate passes bill to teach gay history|author = Associated Press newswire|publisher = CBS News|date = April 14, 2011&lt;!-- 5:22 PM--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was then passed by the Assembly on July 5 by a vote of 49-25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/07/05/Calif_Legislature_Passes_Gay_Education_Bill/|title = Calif. Legislature Passes Gay Education Bill|author = Neal Broverman|publisher = The Advocate|date = July 5, 2011&lt;!-- 08:30:00 PM ET--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Jerry Brown]], who has historically opposed [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] and has generally supported LGBT rights in the state, signed the bill into law on July 14.  Governor Brown said however that state textbooks probably would not be updated to reflect the requirements of the law until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/07/14/california.lgbt.education/index.html|title = California governor signs bill requiring schools to teach gay history|author = CNN|publisher = CNN|date = July 15, 2011&lt;!-- 1:26 AM--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is supported by the [[Gay-Straight Alliance Network|GSA Network]] and [[Equality California]], and the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]] welcomed its ratification into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nclrights.wordpress.com/2011/07/14/nclr-applauds-governor-brown-for-signing-the-historic-fair-education-act/|title = NCLR Applauds Governor Brown for Signing the Historic FAIR Education Act|publisher = National Center for Lesbian Rights|date = July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California Teachers Association's President Dean Vogel stated, “We believe that curricula should address the common values of the society, promote respect for diversity and cooperation, and prepare students to compete in, and cope with a complex and rapidly evolving society. SB 48 does that by helping to ensure that curricular materials include the contributions of persons with disabilities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans to the development of California and United States.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sdgln.com/news/2011/07/14/breaking-news-california-governor-signs-landmark-lgbt-education-bill|title = BREAKING NEWS: California governor signs landmark LGBT education bill|publisher = SDGLN|date = July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is opposed by the [[California Republican Party|state Republican Party]] and [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] organizations. A conservative group called Stop SB 48 is collecting signatures to place a referendum on the June 2012 statewide ballot. If successful, SB 48 would be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stopsb48.com/referendum-filed-to-repeal-sb-48/ Referendum filed to repeal SB 48]&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT rights groups fear that it will be difficult to defend the law if it were to go to a popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hemmelgarn |first=Seth |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=6005 |title=The Bay Area Reporter Online &amp;#124; EQCA: 'No illusion' on Stop SB 48 |publisher=Ebar.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that the law does not include an opt-out option for parents who do not wish to have their children learn about LGBT topics in school.

==Criticism==
In October, 2011, Stop SB 48 failed to collect enough signatures for the issue to be placed on a referendum in June 2012. Opponents of the bill will have other opportunities to overturn the law via a ballot initiative or a constitutional amendment. The constitutional amendment option demands even more signatures and is thus more costly.&lt;ref name=TAI&gt;Resnick, Sofia.

Retrieved 2011-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The repeal campaign has been accused of exaggerating the bill's effects in order to convince people to sign petitions. The Courage Campaign filed a formal complaint with the California Attorney General, District Attorney, and the Oceanside City Attorney on behalf of the witness, Max Disposti.&lt;ref name=TPM /&gt;&lt;ref name=courage&gt;Bullock, Penn.

Retrieved 2011-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Courage campaign also started an online petition asking for an investigation into the tactics of Stop SB 48.&lt;ref name=instinct&gt;[http://instinctmagazine.com/blogs/blog/call-to-action-sign-courage-campaign-s-complaint-against-anti-fair-act-group-s-dishonest-tactics?directory=100011 Call to action: Sign Courage Campaign's complaint against anti-Fair Act group's dishonest tactics] Instinct Magazine, 2011-10-03. Retrieved 2011-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Stop SB 48 sent out an e-mail to their supporters telling them that they indeed plan to pursue a ballot initiative to try and repeal SB 48.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bink |first=Adam |url=http://www.prop8trialtracker.com/2011/11/01/stop-sb-48-campaign-were-working-on-an-initiative/ |title=Stop SB 48 campaign: "We’re working on an initiative" |publisher=Prop 8 Trial Tracker |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are actually two proposals that were submitted to the California Attorney General to be cleared for the collection of signatures. One seeks to outright repeal SB 48, while the other seeks to grant parents the right to opt their children out of such instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hemmelgarn |first=Seth |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=6234 |title=The Bay Area Reporter Online &amp;#124; SB 48 faces new repeal efforts |publisher=Ebar.com |date=2011-11-24 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative to repeal SB 48 failed to gather enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, gathering only about 460,000 of the 504,760 required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_21089102|title=Effort to undo California gay history law fails|publisher=The Associated Press|date=2012-07-16|accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other initiative was withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Laird |first=Cynthia |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=67354 |title=The Bay Area Reporter Online &amp;#124; News in Brief: SB 48 foe drops repeal efforts |publisher=Ebar.com |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Future Business Leaders of America-Phi Beta Lambda''', or '''''FBLA-PBL''''' ('''FBLA-ΦΒΛ'''), is an [[United States|American]] [[career and technical student organization]] that has its headquarters in [[Reston, Virginia|Reston]], [[Virginia]].  Established in 1940, FBLA-PBL is a [[non-profit organization]] of high school ("FBLA"), middle school ("Middle Level"), and college ("PBL") students, as well as professional members ("Professional Division"), who primarily help students transition to the business world. FBLA-PBL is one of the largest student-run organizations in the United States of America{{Citation needed|date=June 2017|reason=Reliable source needed for this statement}}, with 253,365 members, and the largest career student organization in the world. Local FBLA-PBL chapters are often connected to their school's business education department, and most advisers are business education teachers. It is one of the top 10 organizations listed by the U.S. Department of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fbla-pbl.org/web/page/614/sectionid/614/pagelevel/1/main_interior.asp |title=Future Business Leaders of America-Phi Beta Lambda |publisher=Fbla-pbl.org |date=1942-02-03 |accessdate=2012-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226150135/http://www.fbla-pbl.org/web/page/614/sectionid/614/pagelevel/1/main_interior.asp |archivedate=2012-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; FBLA's national charity partner is the March of Dimes, and the March of Dimes provides grants of $1,000 for local chapters and $2,500 for state chapters to promote their goals.

==History==

FBLA-PBL was created by Hamden Forkner of [[Columbia University]]. Forkner, who also created the Forkner shorthand system, proposed that there should be one national organization to join the business clubs throughout the nation. The name "Future Business Leaders of America" was selected in 1940 and two years later the first chapter was created at [[Science Hill High School]] in Johnson City, Tennessee. In 1958, PBL is founded with the first chapter at the University of Northern Iowa and in 1979 the Alumni Division (now the Professional Division) was founded.

=== Key Milestones ===
* 1940: FBLA was established
* 1942: First FBLA chapter is experimentally chartered at Science Hill High School, Johnson City, Tennessee.
* 1958: Phi Beta Lambda, the postsecondary division of FBLA, is created.
* 1969: Granted independent status as a nonprofit educational student association.
* 1973: Edward D. Miller becomes FBLA's first full-time Executive Director.
* 1981: The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation gifts 1.6 acres of land to FBLA-PBL to build the National Center in Reston, VA.
* 1987: National Membership surpasses 200,000.
* 1991: The FBLA National Center is opened.
* 1994: FBLA-Middle Level formed for students Grades 5-9.
* 1997: Jean Buckley appointed President and CEO of FBLA-PBL.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fbla-pbl.org/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

The organization is governed by its board of directors, which consists of the CEO, business leaders, state educators, business education teachers, and the three division national presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fbla-pbl.org/web/page/674/sectionid/570/pagelevel/2/parentid/570/main_interior.asp |title=Future Business Leaders of America-Phi Beta Lambda |publisher=Fbla-pbl.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBLA-PBL's membership is represented by the FBLA, PBL and Professional Division national officer leadership teams. For FBLA and PBL, the officers are elected by voting delegates at the National Leadership Conference (NLC) and installed during the Awards of Excellence Program.

The Professional Division officers are elected by electronic ballot in the spring of each year. The Professional Division President serves a two-year term.

The FBLA and PBL officer teams consist of a president, secretary, treasurer, parliamentarian, and five vice presidents representing each region.

FBLA-PBL divides the United States in five administrative regions. These regions are Western, Mountain Plains, North Central, Southern, and Eastern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbla-pbl.org/about/regions/|title=FBLA-PBL Regions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|accessdate=2018-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state then has what is called a State Chapter, which has its own State Officer Team. The roles in each State Officer Team vary by state, but each usually contains a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and a Parliamentarian. Some also have Historians, Webmasters, and Reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbla-pbl.org/about/regions/|title=FBLA-PBL Regions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Regions.fbla-pbl.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some states are then divided into regions, districts, or areas. These are often governed by an elected official who serves on the State Officer Team. Just like the national regional executive boards, there are small-scale boards in most regions, districts, and/or areas in most states.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Finally, each chapter has its own officer team. Chapter offices vary by chapter. While most use a structure similar to that of the national officers, other use a corporate-style structure with offices such as CEO, CIO, etc. More information can be found on the national FBLA-PBL website.

==Structure==
FBLA is composed of four divisions: FBLA, PBL, Professional Division and FBLA-Middle Level. Each division except for Middle Level (the FBLA National Officers also represent Middle Level) has their own National Officer team, and most states have an FBLA and PBL state officer team. Some states have Middle Level and Professional Division state officer teams. The entire organization contains more than 250,000 members across the four divisions. 

=== FBLA ===
FBLA is the largest division of FBLA-PBL with over 209,000 members. FBLA is separated into five regions: Eastern, Southern, North Central, Mountain Plains and Western. International chapters are part of the Eastern Region. To charter an FBLA state chapter, a state must have at least five local chapters.

=== PBL ===
PBL is the collegiate division of FBLA-PBL with about 10,000 members. PBL can be found in traditional four year colleges, community colleges and career training programs. PBL attends the National Fall Leadership Conferences with FBLA, but has their own National Leadership Conference (NLC) prior to FBLA's NLC. To charter a PBL state chapter, a state must have at least three local chapters.

=== Professional Division ===
FBLA-PBL's Professional Division was founded as the Alumni Division, but had a name change in order to expand to include not only to FBLA alumni, but also the general business community.

== Notable Programs ==

=== FBLA-PBL National Awards Program ===
FBLA-PBL has over 70 competitive events for FBLA and PBL members. Members compete on the regional, state and national level against their peers in their respective event. There are also open events for Middle Level and Professional Division members on the national level.

=== Adviser Wall of Fame ===
The FBLA-PBL Adviser Wall of Fame recognizes advisers who have given back to the organization through their support for their local or state chapter. To be eligible, an adviser must have at least 20 years of service to FBLA.

=== Gold Seal Chapter Award of Merit ===
Also known as the Hollis and Kitty Guy Award, each state may select either 2 chapters or 15% of its total number of chapters (whichever is larger) to be named Gold Seal Chapters on the national level.

=== Chapter Challenge&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.southeastern.edu/orgs/pbl/doc/PBL_HandBook-06-07.pdf|title=FBLA CMH|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
* Super Sweeps has chapters complete 10 tasks focused on recruitment and retention. 
* Non-Stop November has chapters complete 5 tasks focused on membership involvement, March of Dimes Prematurity Awareness Month and American Enterprise Day. 
* Action Awareness has chapters complete 4 tasks related to FBLA-PBL week, CTSO Month and America Saves.

Past and current fellows include leading artists, writers, journalists and former politicians who have made significant contributions to their fields. Previous Fellows have included [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Nelson Mandela]]. The Royal Society of the Arts is based in [[The Strand, London|The Strand]], near the centre of [[London]], [[England]].

==History==
The [[Royal Society of the Arts]] was founded in 1754 by [[William Shipley]] as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacture and Commerce, it was granted a Royal Charter in 1847, and the right to use the term Royal in its name by [[King Edward VII]] in 1908. The shorter version, The Royal Society of Arts and the related RSA acronym, are used more frequently than the full name.

In addition to the Fellowship, the RSA awards three medals, the Albert Medal, the Benjamin Franklin Medal (following a decision by the Board in 2013, the Benjamin Franklin Medal is now overseen by the RSA US, although the final nomination is ratified by the UK Board) and the Bicentenary Medal. Medal winners include [[Nelson Mandela]], Sir [[Frank Whittle]], and Cambridge Professor [[Stephen Hawking]].

==Fellowship==
Since 1754, the RSA Fellowship has been a community of leaders in the fields of art, literature, journalism, and business who have made significant contributions to society or the arts, and are able to support the mission of the RSA. &lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421092124/http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/andy-mabbett-fellow-royal-society-arts|archivedate=2016-04-21|url=http://pigsonthewing.org.uk/andy-mabbett-fellow-royal-society-arts|website=pigsonthewing.org.uk|first=Andy|last=Mabbett|title=For I’m a Jolly Good Fellow (of the RSA)|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IMS VDEX''', which stands for '''IMS Vocabulary Definition Exchange''', is a mark-up language – or grammar – for [[Controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabularies]] developed by IMS Global as an open specification, with the Final Specification being approved in February 2004.

IMS VDEX allows the exchange and expression of simple machine-readable lists of human language terms, along with information that may assist a human in understanding the meaning of the various terms, i.e. a flat list of values, a hierarchical tree of values, a thesaurus, a taxonomy, a glossary or a dictionary.

Structural a vocabulary has an identifier, title and a list of terms. Each term has a unique key, titles and (optional) descriptions. A term may have nested terms, thus a hierarchical structure can be created. It is possible to define relationships between terms and add custom metadata to terms.

IMS VDEX support multilinguality. All values supposed to be read by a human, i.e. titles, can be defined in one or more languages.

== Purposes ==
VDEX was designed to supplement other IMS specifications and the IEEE LOM standard by giving additional semantic control to tool developers. IMS VDEX could be used for the following purposes. It is used in practice for other purposes as well.

* ''Interfaces providing pre-defined choices'' – providing radio buttons and drop-down menus for interfaces such as metadata editors or a repository browse tool, based on the vocabulary allowed in the metadata profile used
* ''Distributing vocabularies among many users'' – achieved by simple XML file sharing, or possibly a searchable [[Repository Open Service Interface Definition|repository]] or registry of vocabularies
* ''XML stylesheets used to select and generate different views'' – selecting an overview of an entire vocabulary as an [[HTML]] or [[PDF]] file, for example; providing scope notes for catalogues; or storing a glossary of terms which are called upon by hyperlinks within a document
* ''Validation of metadata instances'' – validated against an application profile, by comparison of the vocabulary terms used in certain metadata elements with those of the machine readable version of the vocabularies specified by the application profile.
* ''Controlled terms for other IMS specifications and IEEE LOM'' – both may contain elements where controlled terms should be used. These elements are often specified as being of a vocabulary data type, and a definition of the permitted terms and their usage may be expressed using VDEX.

== Technical details ==
[[Image:VDEX model.PNG|350px|right|thumb|simplified VDEX data model]]
The VDEX Information Model is represented in the diagram. A VDEX file describing a vocabulary comprises a number of information elements, most of which are relatively simple, such as a string representation of the default (human) language or a [[URI]] identifying the value domain (or vocabulary). Some of the elements are ‘containers’ – such as a ''term'' – that contain additional elements.

Elements may be required or optional, and in some cases, repeatable. Within a term, for example, a ''description'' and ''caption'' may be defined. Multiple language definitions can be used inside a description, by using a ''langstring'' element, where the description is paired with the language to be used. Additional elements within a term include ''media descriptors'', which are one or more media files to supplement a term’s description; and ''metadata'', which is used to describe the vocabulary further.

The ''relationship'' container defines a relationship between terms by identifying the two terms and the specifying type or relationship, such as a term being broader or narrower than another. The term used to specify the type of relationship may conform to the ISO standards for thesauri.

''Vocabulary identifiers'' are unique, persistent URIs, whereas term or relationship identifiers are locally unique strings. VDEX also allows for a ''default language'' and ''vocabulary name'' to be given, and for whether the ordering of terms within the vocabulary is significant (''order significance'') to be specified.

A ''profile type'' is specified to describe the type of vocabulary being expressed; different features of the VDEX model are permitted depending on the profile type, providing a common grammar for several classes of vocabulary. For example, it is possible, in some profile types, for terms to be contained within one another and be nested, which is suited to the expression of hierarchical vocabularies. Five profile types exist: ''lax'', ''thesaurus'', ''hierarchicalTokenTerms'', ‘glossaryOrDictionary’ and ''flatTokenTerms''. The lax profile is the least restrictive and offers the full VDEX model, whereas the flatTokenTerms profile is the most restrictive and lightweight.

VDEX also offers some scope for complex vocabularies, assuming the existence of a well-defined application profile (for exchange interoperability). Some examples are:
* ''Faceted schemes'' – faceted vocabularies are possible with the definition of appropriate relationships
* ''Multi-lingual thesauri'' – metadata could be used within a relationship to achieve multilingual thesauri
* ''Polyhierarchical taxonomies'' – can be expressed using the source/target value pairs in the relationship.

Identifiers in VDEX data should be persistent, unique, resolvable, transportable and URI-compliant. Specifically, vocabulary identifiers should be unique URIs, whereas term and relationship identifiers should be locally unique strings.

== Implementations ==
* [http://aloha2.netera.ca/ ALOHA Metadata Tagging Tool] — Java-based software project that can read IMS VDEX files.
* [http://www.ivimeds.org/news/demonstrator.html IVIMEDS 1G v1.0] – from The International Virtual Medical School – includes VDEX instances in curriculum maps. Partners can create their own maps in VDEX format and use these to help students search the repository.
* [http://www.elframework.org/projects/spws/view Skills Profiling Web Service] — project implemented and demonstrated use of a skills profiling web service using open standards in a medical context. IMS VDEX files were used in the representation of the SPWS hierarchy skills framework.

* [http://prs.heacademy.ac.uk/technical/vdex_scripts.html VDEX XSLT scripts] — developed by The Higher Education Academy Centre for Philosophical and Religious Studies to convert VDEX to XHTML and PostgreSQL .
* [http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/vdex VDEX Implementation Project] — carried out by the Institute for Computer-Based Learning at Heriot–Watt University, with a primary objective of creating a tool for editing vocabularies in VDEX format. The project, which ended in January 2004, was based on the Public Draft (not the current Final Specification).
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdex-j/ VDEX Java Binding] — implementation neutral Java interface for VDEX, as well as providing a default implementation of that interface, and XML marshalling functionality.
* [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/imsvdex imsvdex Python egg] —  API for VDEX XML-files. It is free software written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].
* [http://plone.org/products/atvocabularymanager ATVocabularyManager] — addon for [[Plone]] CMS uses VDEX as a possible format to define vocabularies.
* [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.vdexvocabulary collective.vdexvocabulary] — implements IMS VDEX as standard [[Zope]] vocabulary which can also be used in [[Plone]] CMS, written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

The '''Smithsonian museums''' are the most widely visible part of the United States' [[Smithsonian Institution]] and consist of nineteen museums and galleries as well as the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]].&lt;ref name="Fact"&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/facts-about-smithsonian-institution Facts about the Smithsonian Institution]. newsdesk.si.edu (Pressroom of the Smithsonian Institution). Retrieved February 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Seventeen of these collections are located in [[Washington D.C.]], with eleven of those located on the [[National Mall]]. The remaining ones are in New York City and [[Chantilly, Virginia]]. As of 2010, one museum, the [[Arts and Industries Building]], is closed in preparation for a substantial renovation,&lt;ref name="Fact"/&gt; and its newest museum building, the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]], opened in 2016.&lt;ref name="NMAAHC"&gt;[http://nmaahcdesign.si.edu/overview/ Building The Museum, Overview]. National Museum of African American History and Culture. Retrieved January 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth of the Smithsonian Institution can be traced to the acceptance of [[James Smithson]]'s legacy, willed to the United States in 1826. Smithson died in 1829, and in 1836, President [[Andrew Jackson]] informed [[United States Congress|Congress]] of the gift, which it accepted. In 1838, Smithson's legacy, which totaled more than $500,000, was delivered to the [[United States Mint]] and entered the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]]. After eight years, in 1846, the Smithsonian Institution was established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.si.edu/About/History History]. Smithsonian Institution. Retrieved November 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Smithsonian Institution Building]] (also known as "The Castle") was completed in 1855 to house an art gallery, a library, a chemical laboratory, lecture halls, museum galleries, and offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/Exhibitions/Smithson-to-Smithsonian/building_01.html The Smithsonian Building: A Building Worthy of Smithson's Gift]. [http://www.sil.si.edu/Exhibitions/Smithson-to-Smithsonian/ From Smithson to Smithsonian: The Birth of an Institution]. Smithsonian Institution. Retrieved March 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the Smithsonian was a learning institution concerned mainly with enhancing science and less interested in being a museum. Under the second secretary, [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]], the Smithsonian turned into a full-fledged museum, mostly through the acquisition of 60 [[boxcar]]s worth of displays from the [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]]. The income from the exhibition of these artifacts allowed for the construction of the National Museum, which is now known as the Arts and Industries Building. This structure was opened in 1881 to provide the Smithsonian with its first proper facility for public display of the growing collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/baird/bairdd.htm Baird and the Centennial Exposition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616234557/http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/baird/bairdd.htm |date=2013-06-16 }}.

Smithsonian Institution. Retrieved March 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institution grew slowly until 1964 when [[Sidney Dillon Ripley]] became secretary. Ripley managed to expand the institution by eight museums and increased admission from 10.8 million to 30 million people a year.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Molotsky, Irvin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/13/us/s-dillon-ripley-dies-87-led-smithsonian-institution-during-its-greatest-growth.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 S. Dillon Ripley Dies at 87; Led the Smithsonian Institution During Its Greatest Growth]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. March 13, 2001, Retrieved March 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This period included the greatest and most rapid growth for the Smithsonian, and it continued until Ripley's resignation in 1984.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Since the completion of the Arts and Industries Building, the Smithsonian has expanded to twenty separate museums with roughly 137 million objects in their collections, including works of art, natural specimens, and cultural artifacts.&lt;ref name="Fact" /&gt; The Smithsonian museums are visited by over 25 million people every year.&lt;ref name="Fact" /&gt;

==Museums==
Eleven of the 19 Smithsonian Institution museums and galleries are at the [[National Mall]] in Washington D.C., the open-area [[List of areas in the United States National Park System|national park]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] running between the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and the [[United States Capitol]], with the [[Washington Monument]] providing a division slightly west of the center.&lt;ref name="Fact" /&gt; Five other Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo are located elsewhere in Washington. Two more Smithsonian museums are located in New York City and one is located in [[Chantilly, Virginia]].

The Smithsonian also holds close ties with 171 museums in 41 [[U.S. state|states]], as well as Panama and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Fact" /&gt; These museums are known as [[Smithsonian Affiliations|Smithsonian Affiliates]]. Collections of artifacts are given to these museums in the form of long-term loans from the Smithsonian. These long-term loans are not the only Smithsonian exhibits outside the Smithsonian museums. The Smithsonian also has a large number of traveling exhibitions. Each year more than 50 exhibitions travel to hundreds of cities and towns all across the United States.&lt;ref name="Fact" /&gt;

The '''lycée Jacques-Monod''' is a French institute of secondary and higher education located in [[Lescar]] ([[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]]). It has more than {{nobr|800 students}}, and is located in a building with a rich history.

== History ==
[[File:Lescar Lycée 1900.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The establishment in 1900]]

In 1624,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebrelblanco.com/anexos/atlasBE-Lescar-grandPau.htm Histoire de Lescar - Grand-Pau]&lt;/ref&gt; three [[Barnabites]] living in Lescar in the college founded two years earlier by Bishop Jean de Salettes, with the mission of educating the youth. However, faced with the success of the college, the building proved too small.

A new building was built gradually between 1755 and 1779 to accommodate 100 students. This was the central building of the lycée Jacques-Monod. An important library was also constructed, and parts of it still form the current library at [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]]. After the revolution, the religious order were forbidden to enter the college, and it closed in 1793. Over the following years, the building occupied numerous roles: house of detention, war hospital during the war with Spain, and even cotton mill.

After 1845, the building returned to its original function, with the founding of a teacher training college for the département of [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Basses-Pyrénées]]. In 1978, the building became an annex of the lycée Saint-Cricq in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]]. Finally, the independent lycée Jacques-Monod opened its doors in 1992 after expansion work. The current premises occupy more than {{convert|10500|m²}} and house more than {{nobr|800 students}}, including boarders.

== Today ==
=== Educational structure ===

The lycée Jacques-Monod is composed of:
*{{nobr|8 classes}} of general secondary education (around {{nobr|230 students}}) ;
*{{nobr|3 classes}} of 1st and Tlst S ;
*{{nobr|2 classes}} of 1st Tlst ES ;
*{{nobr|1 classe}} of 1st and Tlst L ;
*{{nobr|2 classe}} of 1st ST2S and {{nobr|2 classes}} of Tlst ST2S ;
*{{nobr|1 classe}} of 1st and Tlst STL ;
*{{nobr|1 classe}} of BTS bio.

=== Evolution of the lycée ===

The works &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larepubliquedespyrenees.fr/2012/09/10/le-lycee-jacques-monod-en-pleine-mutation,1096916.php La République des Pyrénées du 10/09/2012]&lt;/ref&gt; were undertaken to allow construction of a new building of {{convert|2500|m²}} in the lycée park. This has been operational since {{nobr|the end of 2013}} and comprises a kitchen, canteen, library, student office, and reception, student foyer, and multipurpose room for exams, conferences, and student events. The spaces also allow the existing building to free up rooms for courses, local partners, and teachers' lounges. Finally, the cost of the restructuring project was 10.5 million Euros, financed by the region of [[Aquitaine]].

Peter Elsner-Mackay, Austrian Ambassador to the UAE, Mohammed Saeed Al Raqbani, General Manager of Dubai Investments Industries, and other top officials.&lt;ref name="zawya.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zawya.com/story/Dubai_Investments_invests_90_in_MODUL_University_Dubai_campus-ZAWYA20151124102523/|title=Dubai Investments invests 90% in MODUL University Dubai campus|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ceremony, the below was said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Education is one of the fastest growing sectors in the UAE, driven by a growing population and the rising demand for quality education. Dubai Investments is committed to play a pivotal role in facilitating the knowledge-sharing; and bringing the prestigious MODUL University to Dubai is a step in the direction amidst unprecedented growth opportunities on offer in the UAE education sector. Only 2% of institutions in the UAE offer courses in tourism and hospitality, whereas this sector alone employs over 530,000 professionals in the country. With the tourism and hospitality sector forecast to grow 9% year-on-year and government's increased emphasis on boosting tourism avenues, we feel MODUL University Dubai is the right fit in the UAE market, with its strong legacy in the tourism and hospitality education worldwide.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Khalid Bin Kalban, Managing Director and CEO of Dubai Investments''' &lt;ref name="zawya.com"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;MODUL University Vienna enjoys a sterling international reputation for its standards and the reputed Austrian know-how in education. The comprehensive academic curriculum, particularly in the tourism and hospitality sector, will prepare students in the UAE and the GCC for the competitive world. We are happy to join hands with Dubai Investments and DACH ADVISORY in achieving this&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Sustainability as a fundamental principle==

[[File:Sustainability Award.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Sustainability Award Certificate]]MODUL University Vienna has identified sustainability as one of its key principles.&lt;ref name="Sustainability"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MODUL University Vienna|first=Sustainability Committee|coauthors=|title=Sustainability at MU Vienna|work=|pages=|language=|publisher=MODUL University Vienna|year=2007|url=http://www.modul.ac.at/sustainability|accessdate=2010-08-26|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability represents an integral part of the curriculum and research agenda, and is also reflected in the daily work-flow. The university operates in a manner that minimizes environmental risk and adverse effects on the environment. The solar panels, pellet heating and recycling system in the university building are just some examples of the sustainable living and thinking within the university. In addition, [[MODUL University Vienna]] was the first Austrian university to sign a contract with a renewable energy provider. An internal ‘Sustainability Committee’ (SC) composed of staff, faculty and students works to maintain and improve the university’s sustainability goals.

MODUL University was awarded 2nd place in the category "Structural Foundations," encouraging sustainable development at the 2010 Sustainability Awards &lt;ref name="Sustainability Award 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=forum umwelt bildung|first=|coauthors=|title=Nachhaltige Universitäten - Sustainability Awards|work=|pages=|language=|publisher=forum umwelt bildung|year=2010|url=http://www.umweltbildung.at/cgi-bin/cms/af.pl?navid=50|accessdate=2010-08-26|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research for its Sustainability Committee.&lt;ref name="Sustainability Award 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiller|first=Tina|coauthors=|title=MODUL University in 2nd place at 2010 Sustainability Awards|work=|pages=|language=|publisher=MODUL University Vienna|year=2010|url=http://www.modul.ac.at/blog/2010-05-modul-sustainability-committee-receives-award|accessdate=2010-08-26|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2012 awards it won first place in the category "Structural Foundation" and third place in the category "Teaching &amp; Curricula/International Cooperations". The committee gives two awards annually for the best ideas for sustainability implementable at the university; the Scholarship of Hope for students and the Employee Sustainability Award for the staff and faculty. Extracurricular activities such as movie nights and excursions to sustainable energy producers are also arranged by the Sustainability Committee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6710">The '''abacus system''' of [[mental calculation]] is a system where users mentally visualize an [[abacus]] to do [[calculations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shuzan.jp/english/brain/brain.html|title=Research on the benefits of mental abacus for development|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No physical abacus is used; only the answers are written down.  Calculations can be made at great speed in this way.  For example, in the '''Flash Anzan''' event at the [[All Japan Soroban Championship]], champion Takeo Sasano was able to add fifteen three-digit numbers in just 1.7 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2012/oct/29/mathematics |title=World's fastest number game wows spectators and scientists |journal=[[The Guardian]] |author =Alex Bellos |author-link =Alex Bellos |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system is being propagated in [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sh.xinhuanet.com/2004-04/13/content_1964401.htm|title=(Chinese)Teaching Kids Visit to use abacus for mental calculation|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Japan]]. Mental calculation is said to improve mental capability, increases speed of response, memory power, and concentration power.

Many veteran and prolific abacus users in China, Japan, South Korea, and others who use the abacus daily, naturally tend to not use the abacus anymore but perform calculations by visualizing the abacus. This was verified when the [[right brain]] measured heightened [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] activity when calculating and compared with non-veterans who were using the abacus to perform calculations.

The standard abacus can be used to perform addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication; the abacus can also be used to extract square-roots and cubic roots.

The '''National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers''' ('''NASUWT''') is a [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]]-affiliated trade union representing teachers, including headteachers, throughout the [[United Kingdom]].

The union organises in all sectors from early years to further education and represents teachers in all roles including heads and deputies. With over 300,000 members, it is the second largest teachers' union in [[UK|United Kingdom]]. The NASUWT claims to be independent of any political party,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and seeks to influence educational policy on behalf of its members with [[Government of the UK|national government]] and the devolved assemblies in [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]], [[Welsh Assembly|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]].

==History==
[[File:Birmingham Pride 2011 NASUWT Car.jpg|thumb|right|The NASUWT made an appearance in the [[Birmingham Pride]] parade in 2011]]
The NASUWT resulted from the 1976 merger of the [[National Association of Schoolmasters]] (NAS) with the [[Union of Women Teachers]] (UWT) and the [[Scottish Schoolmasters' Association]].&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marsh |first1=Arthur |last2=Ryan |first2=Victoria |title=Historical Directory of Trade Unions |volume=1 |date=1980 |publisher=Gower |location=Farnborough |isbn=0566021609 |pages=139&amp;ndash;140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was largely a consequence of the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], which made it unlawful to exclude from membership on grounds of gender, and became the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers (NAS/UWT).&lt;ref name="R. Seifert 1995 p.97"&gt;M. Ironside and R. Seifert, Industrial Relations in Schools, (London: Routledge 1995), p.97&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, the [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]] has been dropped from the name.

The NAS/UWT took part in long-running industrial action between 1984 and 1986, in support of a pay claim and the retention of the Burnham committee. Both the NAS/UWT and NUT lost members to the less militant [[Professional Association of Teachers]] and [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers|Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association]].&lt;ref name="TES200511"&gt;{{cite news |title=100 years of unions |author=Michael Shaw |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6082657&amp;navcode=94 |newspaper=TES Magazine |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern structure==

NASUWT policy is determined by its annual conference, to which delegates are elected from over 300 local associations. Members also elect the National Executive Committee of 44 members.&lt;ref name="executivemembers"&gt;
{{Cite web
  | title = National Executive Members

  | url = http://www.nasuwt.org.uk/JoinNASUWT/AboutNASUWT/AboutNASUWT/NationalExecutiveMembers/
  | accessdate = 8 January 2015
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This committee, together with the General Secretary and other elected officials, determine the day-to-day business of the union.

==Relations with government==

From 2003 to 2010 the NASUWT was involved in "social partnership" - a programme of meetings between union leaders, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government and employers' organisations. The meetings were initially to discuss pay and workforce issues but developed into a forum for broader discussion on policy proposals.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web

  | publisher = Policy Exchange
  | url = http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/item/a-licence-to-teach
  | accessdate = 19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Union of Teachers]] chose not to participate in social partnership. The NASUWT argues{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} that social partnership brought about benefits to teachers' terms and conditions through the "National Agreement – Raising Standards, Tackling Workload", especially the introduction of defined planning and assessment time for all teachers.

Social partnership was confined to the Labour government, and did not continue after the establishment of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition]] in 2010. Instead, the union lodged a formal trade dispute with the government over workload, conditions of service, pensions, and jobs. In November 2011, members of the NASUWT voted by a 4-to-1 margin&lt;ref name="2011ballotresult"&gt;

==NASUWT campaigns==

The NASUWT has initiated a number of influential campaigns in recent years, including a campaign leading to the abolition of a [[code of conduct]] proposed by the [[General Teaching Council for England|General Teaching Council]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; a campaign to preserve the anonymity of teachers from malicious or false allegations,{{citation needed|date=February 2011|reason=No thing on website}} and a campaign to bar members of the [[British National Party]] from the teaching profession.&lt;ref&gt;

After 2010, the union joined campaigns against the coalition government. It asserted that "the [[Education Act 2011]] heralded the break-up of the entire state education service"&lt;ref name="annualreport2011"&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">The National Curriculum was first introduced in Wales as part of the [[Education Reform Act 1988]], alongside the equivalent curriculum for England. Following devolution in 1999, education became a matter for the Welsh government. Consequently, some elements of the system are different from those in England.

==Structure of the National Curriculum==
Schooling is divided into four phases in Wales, each relating to pupils of different ages. Key Stages 2 to 4 mirror those used in England, with pupils in Key Stage 2 being aged 7-11, in Key Stage 3 aged 11-14 and Key Stage 4 representing the GCSE years of 14- to 16-year-olds. For children aged between 3 and 7, the key stage is known as the Foundation Phase. Within each phase or key stage, certain subjects are set out in statute as part of the national curriculum.

===Foundation phase===
Within the foundation phase, the curriculum is set out in seven areas of learning:
* Personal and Social Development, Well-being and Cultural Diversity
* Language, Literacy and Communication Skills
* Mathematical Development
* Welsh Language Development
* Knowledge and Understanding of the World
* Physical Development
* Creative Development

===Key Stages 2, 3 and 4===
The following subjects are statutory at each of the later key stages:

The '''Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign''', also called the '''Literacy Campaign''', was a campaign launched in 1980 by the [[Sandinista]] government in order to reduce [[illiteracy]] in [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite news | first=Ulrike | last=Hanemann | title=Nicaragua’s literacy campaign | publisher=UNESCO | url =http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001460/146007e.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded the prestigious [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO Nadezhda K. Krupskaya literacy prize|Literacy Award]]. There have been many other literacy campaigns in the country since the first one was launched in 1980.

==The Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign of 1980==

===History, planning and goals===
Prior to the Sandinista Revolution in 1979 the majority of the [[rural]] population of Nicaragua was illiterate, with estimates as high as 75%-90%. The total population had an estimated illiteracy rate of 50%. Planning for the literacy campaign began approximately four months after the Sandinista Revolution which overthrew the [[Somoza]] political dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Cuban Revolution and Its Extension: Resolution of the Socialist Workers Party | publisher = Resistance Books | year = 1984 | location = [[Cuba]] | isbn = 0-909196-22-2 | page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parsa | first = Misagh | title = States, Ideologies, and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of Iran, Nicaragua and the Philippines | publisher = Cambridge University | year = 2000| isbn = 0-521-77430-6 | page = 224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 60,000 youths (high school and college age) and 30,000 adults of varying backgrounds were trained in two weeks for the five-month campaign.

===The Literacy Campaign===
The first Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign was launched by the [[Sandinista]] government and took place between March 3 and August 23, 1980. It was just one of the key large scale programs that the Sandinista government implemented during their presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Historical Background of Nicaragua | publisher=Stanford University | url =http://www.stanford.edu/group/arts/nicaragua/discovery_eng/history/background.html | accessdate = 2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicaragua Pre-election Delegation Report |publisher=Global Exchange |url=http://www.globalexchange.org/tours/NicaraguaReportOct2001.html |accessdate=2007-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930032055/http://www.globalexchange.org/tours/NicaraguaReportOct2001.html |archivedate=2006-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers came from all over the country to participate in the project. There were two types of volunteers in the project, those who could not leave for the countryside such as: housewives, government employees and workers; thus, they worked in urban neighborhoods as ''Citizens’ Literacy Promoters'' (AP). The second and most important groups of volunteers under the ''Popular Literacy Army'' (EPA) were the youth that worked full-time in the rural and mountainous areas.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Literacy Exchange: World Resources on Literacy |url=http://www1.uni-hamburg.de/UNESCO-UIE/literacyexchange/nicaragua/nicaraguadata.htm |work=Literacy Exchange-UIE |accessdate=2008-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811053055/http://www1.uni-hamburg.de/UNESCO-UIE/literacyexchange/nicaragua/nicaraguadata.htm |archivedate=August 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups of influential youth who mostly came from secondary schools or universities, were named after the brigadistas that contributed to the [[Cuban Literacy Campaign]]. Like their Cuban mentors, the brigadistas did not only teach the rural peasants to read and write; but they were also integrated into the families, bridging the gap between the rural and urban citizens of the nation. Because the young volunteers were as young as 12 years of age, many parents speculated on the idea of allowing them to participate.

Massive campaigns through the media and youth groups were organized in order to convince them. Other campaigns had to also be arranged to convince teachers to participate, because a lot of them despised the idea of working closely with their students. Altogether, approximately 95,140.87 Nicaraguans actually volunteered in the campaign.

The campaign used a number of tactics to increase the participation and creativity of the illiterates during their learning process which included experiential learning, dialogue, group discussions and collective problem solving. However, these tactics were not as successful as perceived because the training process of the volunteers was very brief and started a month before the actual campaign. The first stage of the training process consisted of a two-week intensive workshop and those trained first would train the next group of volunteers. After the 3rd group was trained, schools and universities were closed down in order to train the remaining. 
	 
Literacy Congresses were held in order to evaluate the outcome of the literacy campaign. The evaluation illustrated impressive results considering the fact that a rocky road was taken to get to where they were. Altogether, about one-fifth of the population participated directly in the campaign and almost everyone was affected in at least an indirect way. Overall, illiteracy had reduced by about 37.39% with about 7% illiterates in the industrialized Pacific and 25.95% in the less developed regions. Even though illiteracy was still higher in the rural areas, they were more affected by the campaign with a major decrease of about 52.5%. The interaction between the rural and urban regions in Nicaragua was one of the most important results. Such interactions led to the integration of the once quite independent two regions, with a binding sense of nationalism throughout the country. The fact that every class, race, gender and age was involved, brought about a new perspective towards the distribution of power and wealth. Women also played a major role in the literacy campaign. Like the Cuban example, about 60% of the brigadistas were female and such a title made the women feel a sense of belonging and equalization in the revolutionary process of their country. Lastly, due to the great success of the campaign, Nicaragua made a substantial contribution in finding solutions for the eradication of illiteracy worldwide. In September 1980, [[UNESCO]] awarded Nicaragua with the [[UNESCO Nadezhda K. Krupskaya literacy prize|Nadezhda K. Krupskaya award]] for its successful literacy campaign. This was followed by the literacy campaigns of 1982, 1986, 1987, 1995 and 2000, all of which were also awarded by UNESCO.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

==Other literacy campaigns==
From October to March 1981 additional campaigns were held in Nicaragua's Caribbean coast to reduce illiteracy to over 12,000 people in their native languages of in local [[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Sumo language|Sumo]] and various Creole languages such as [[Miskito Coastal Creole|Nicaraguan Creole]]. This was followed by many other literacy campaigns throughout the nation.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;

===Literacy campaigns of 2005–2009===

The first phase of the literacy campaign was carried out with support of Sandinista mayors’ offices and used audiovisual equipment and teaching materials donated by [[Cuba]] as well as consulting assistance. During that period, around 70,000 people learned to read and write.

In 2007, after [[Daniel Ortega]] began his second term as [[President of Nicaragua]], under the Carlos Fonseca Amador Popular Education Association, a new literacy campaign was announced and later launched in March 2007. The new literacy campaign was based on the "[[Yo, sí puedo]]" (Yes, I can) Cuban method. Estimates say over 350,000-500,000 Nicaraguans would be taught to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cuban Method to Teach 350,000 Nicaraguans to Read | url =http://www.cubaminrex.cu/english/cooperation/Cuba%20cooperation.htm | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070213034804/http://www.cubaminrex.cu/english/cooperation/Cuba%20cooperation.htm | dead-url =yes | archive-date =2007-02-13 | work =Granma | accessdate = 2008-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The literacy campaign was coordinated by Orlando Pineda and received finance and support from [[Cuba]], [[Spain]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Massive Literacy Campaign | url =http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/3526 | work =Revista Envío | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the literacy campaigns is to declare Nicaragua free of illiteracy by 2009.

'''The Ontario College of Trades''' (College) is the regulatory body that governs skilled trades in Ontario. The College officially opened its doors on April 8, 2013 and its activities are mandated by the ''Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act, 2009'' (OCTAA).

==Organization==
The College is governed by a board of governors with 21 members-4 members from construction, industrial, motive power, and service fields. In addition each trade is represented by a trade board consisting of 4-12 members, consisting of an equal number of employers and employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeoftrades.ca/about/governance |title=Ontario College of Trades, Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization itself is staffed by approximately 150 professional and enforcement staff in various departments including Standards, Policy &amp; Research, Compliance &amp; Enforcement, Communications, and Corporate Governance.

All members of the governing structure are appointed by an independent Appointments Council, who are in turn appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pas.gov.on.ca/scripts/en/BoardDetails.asp?boardID=142360 |title=Public Appointment Secretariat - College of Trades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Skilled trades in Ontario consist of two broad categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeoftrades.ca/trades-in-ontario |title=Ontario College of Trades - Trades in Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Compulsory trades require certification for a person to engage in the practice of the trade. Examples of compulsory trades are: electrician, tower crane operator, automotive service technician, and hairstylist .
# Voluntary trades do not require certification for a person to engage in the practice of the trade. Examples of non-compulsory trades are: construction millwright, general carpenter, arborist, and cook.

Under the '''Ontario College of Trades and Apprenticeship Act, 2009,'' (OCTAA) one cannot hold themselves as having a Certificate of Qualification in either a compulsory trade or voluntary trade unless they are a member of the College (with some exceptions). As well, all apprentices must be members of the College.

Those holding Certificates of Qualification in voluntary trades before 2013 who have opted to not join the College are not required to present their Certificate of Qualification to inspectors. As well, they cannot have their Certificate of Qualification suspended or revoked by the College but as per all members, must abide by the College's Code of Ethics.

To maintain membership, members are charged a membership fee.

There are a number of different membership classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeoftrades.ca/membership/become-a-member/classes-of-members-fees |title=Ontario College of Trades - Classes of Members &amp; Fees}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apprentices - $60/yr
* Journeyperson Candidates - $60/yr
* Non-certified tradespersons - $60/yr
* Journeypersons - $120/yr
* Employers and sponsors - $120/yr 

==Importance of licencing and membership==
In Ontario and according to OCTAA, in order to ensure the safety and certification of qualifications for all journeypersons in the 23 compulsory trades and all apprentices regardless of their trades’ classification, membership in the College is legally required. 

Being a member of the College separates those with certification and training from underground and unregulated, uncertifed workers.

All members are searchable on the College’s [http://www.collegeoftrades.ca/public-register-search Public Register], which is an online database that enables anyone to easily confirm the qualifications of any compulsory tradesperson or apprentice before hiring them to fix their toilet, wire their house, change their brakes or cut/colour their hair. 

Like all regulatory bodies in Ontario, the College is required to be financially self-sustaining, and just like the College of Teachers or the College of Nurses, the Ontario College of Trades is funded entirely through membership fees. 

Fees go towards the establishment of apprenticeship training programs, updating training and curriculum standards—some of which have not been updated in 20 years— and exams, promotion of trades to youth and underrepresented groups, and compliance activities.

==Dean Report==
In 2015, former Secretary of Cabinet Tony Dean released a report making a number of recommendations to support the development of the College of Trades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpacmag.com/news/tony-dean-completes-review-of-the-ontario-college-of-trades/1003909472/?&amp;er=NA |title=Tony Dean completes review of the Ontario College of Trades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommendations in the report encompassed many areas including governance models, noting that most professional organizations have some membership elected representation. However; the primary areas covered were scopes of practice, trade classification and reclassification reviews, ratio reviews, and enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcu.gov.on.ca/eng/collegeoftrades/deanreview/index.html |title=The Dean Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of construction trade unions, including the Ontario Sheet Metal Workers Conference and the International Brotherhood of Metal Workers opposed the report because it lacked consultation with stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/certified-construction-trades-united-in-opposition-to-dean-report-2076806.htm |title=Certified Construction Trades United in Opposition to Dean Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; However; the largest construction union in North America, [[LiUNA]], has expressed cautious optimism and support for the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/liuna-applauds-the-dean-report-supporting-a-strong-and-sustainable-ontario-college-of-trades-553042351.html |title=LiUNA Applauds the Dean Report, Supporting a Strong and Sustainable Ontario College of Trades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the release of this report, several regulations based on its recommendations have been passed by government and the College has been working on the implementation of most of Dean's suggestions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6491">[[File:Plastic pattern blocks.JPG|thumb|Plastic Pattern Blocks]]
'''Pattern Blocks''' are one of the [[mathematical manipulatives]] developed in the 1960s by [[Education Development Center]] as part of their Elementary Science Study project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picciotto.org/math-ed/angles/index.html Picciotto Math Education]&lt;/ref&gt; They are both a play resource and a tool for learning in mathematics, which serve to develop spatial reasoning skills that are fundamental to the learning of mathematics. Among other things, they allow children to see how shapes can be composed and decomposed into other shapes, and introduce children to ideas of [[Tessellation|tilings]]. Pattern blocks sets include multiple copies of just six shapes:
*[[Equilateral triangle]] (Green)
*60° [[rhombus]] (2 triangles) (Blue) that can be matched with two of the green triangles
*30° Narrow rhombus (Beige) with the same side-length as the green triangle
*[[Trapezoid]] (half hexagon or 3 triangles) (Red) that can be matched with three of the green triangles
*Regular [[Hexagon]] (6 triangles) (Yellow) that can be matched with six of the green triangles 
*[[Square (geometry)|Square]] (Orange) with the same side-length as the green triangle

All the angles are multiples of 30° (1/12 of a circle): 30° (1×), 60° (2×), 90° (3×), 120° (4×), and 150° (5×).

== Use==
The blocks were designed with their possibilites for both mathematics and play in mind. The advice given in the 1968 EDC Teacher's Guide is: "Take out the blocks, and play with them yourself. Try out some of your own ideas. Then, when you give the blocks to the children, sit back and watch what they do."&lt;ref name="Teacherguide"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elementary Science Study |title=Teacher's guide for pattern blocks |date=1970 |url=https://books.google.fr/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=m1oQAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=ISBN |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Christopher Danielson identifies a number of frequent features of play which occur:&lt;ref&gt;From  the accompanying booklet to his Twenty-First Century Pattern Blocks&lt;/ref&gt;
* Composing and Decomposing
* Symmetry
* Patterns
* Three Dimensions
* Negative Space
* Representational
[[File:A symmetrical pattern block design created by eight year olds.jpg|thumb|A symmetrical pattern block design created by eight year olds]]
The EDC Teacher's Guide continues: "Many children start by making abstract designs — both symmetrical and asymmetrical. As play continues these designs may become more and more elegant and complex, or they become simple as the child refines his ideas."

An example of their use is given by Meha Agrawal: "Starting from the center, I would add tier after tier of blocks to build my pattern — it was an iterative process, because if something didn't look aesthetically appealing or fit correctly, it would require peeling off a layer and reevaluating ways to fix it. The best part was the gratification I received when my creation was complete. Though individually boring, collectively these blocks produced an intricate masterpiece that brought art and math, big-picture and detail, simplicity and complexity closer together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McFarland|first=Matt|title=The childhood toys that inspired female engineers and scientists|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2013/12/09/the-childhood-toys-that-inspired-female-engineers-and-scientists/|accessdate=10 December 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==
A number of compatible shapes that extend pattern blocks are commercially available. Two sets of "Fractional Pattern Blocks" exist: both with two blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spark: Math Manipulatives|url=http://www.ucds.org/spark/manipulatives.html|website=www.ucds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first has a pink double hexagon and a black chevron equivalent to four triangles. The second has a brown half-trapezoid and a pink half-triangle. Another set, Deci-Blocks, is made up of six shapes, equivalent to four, five, seven, eight, nine and ten triangles respectively.

Christopher Danielson developed a new set of five blocks, Twenty-First Century Pattern Blocks.&lt;ref name="21stC"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Danielson |first1=Christopher |title=Twenty-First Century Pattern Blocks |url=http://talkingmathwithkids.squarespace.com/store/21st-century-pattern-blocks |website=Talking Math With Your Kids |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhombus in this set has the same size as the blue rhombus in the traditional set. The [[Kite (geometry)|dart]] and the [[Special right triangle#30°–60°–90° triangle|30°–60°–90° triangle]] have the same area, while the [[Kite (geometry)|kite]] and the hexagon are twice that area. Like the traditional set, all the angles are multiples of 30°.

'''The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage''' is a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[grantmaking]] organization and knowledge-sharing hub for arts and culture in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], established in 2005. The Center receives funding from [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] and makes project grants in two areas, Performance and Exhibitions &amp; Public Interpretation, as well as awarding grants to individual artists through Pew Fellowships. The Center also makes Advancement grants, substantial awards to high-performing organizations seeking to make lasting improvements to their programming, audience engagement, and financial health. Its current mission is to "support artists and organizations whose work is distinguished by excellence, imagination, and courage." In 2008, [[Paula Marincola]] was named the first [[executive director]].

== History and timeline ==

In 2005, [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] brought seven programs—in dance, visual arts and exhibitions, heritage, cultural management, music, theater, and individual artist fellowships—together under one roof, as The Philadelphia Center for Arts &amp; Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/approach/philadelphia |title=Approach: Philadelphia |publisher=Pewtrusts.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center received its current name in 2008. These programs have since merged to form a single entity that awards grants throughout Greater Philadelphia. In 2013 the Center merged its Project Grant programs to create two new funding categories: Performance and Exhibitions &amp; Public Interpretation. Since 1989, the Center has awarded over $134 million to artists and arts organizations in the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania]] region, which includes [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks]], [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]], [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]], and [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] counties. The Center also makes Advancement grants to support high-performing institutions undertaking bold, innovative organizational initiatives.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcah.us/pages/faq |title=FAQ : The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage |publisher=Pcah.us |date= |accessdate=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.pewtrusts.org/en/archive/fall-2014/art-for-all|title=Art for All|publisher=|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pew Fellowships ===

'''Pew Fellowships''' is a funding program of [[The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage]],  established by the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] in 1991, which offers direct support to individual [[Philadelphia]]-area artists across disciplines, annually awarding up to 12 unrestricted grants of $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcah.us/brochurepages/apply |title=Apply : The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage |publisher=Pcah.us |date= |accessdate=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Fellowships provide artists with an economic freedom that presents the opportunity to focus on their individual practices over a considerable period of time—to explore, to experiment, and to develop their work. The program aims to elevate the quality and raise the profile of individual artistic work in Philadelphia's five-county region, to create a strong community of Pew Fellows, and to help them achieve their artistic and career goals by connecting them to additional resources in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Beginning with the 2008 fellowships, the grant amount has increased from $50,000 to $60,000. To date, the Pew Fellowships in the Arts has awarded $11.1 million—220 fellowships have been awarded and 226 artists have been honored with the distinction of receiving the highly competitive fellowships. (Fellowships have been awarded to 4 collaborative teams over the years.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pew Fellowships are by nomination only, and selections are made through a two-tier peer review process. Applications are first reviewed by discipline-specific panels, which select finalists to be reviewed by a final interdisciplinary panel. Panelists are artists and arts and culture professionals from outside of the Philadelphia area; chosen for their expertise, they serve for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcah.us/media/files/fc24d33fc331bd803fcaead260b87a1e.pdf |title=Application Guidelines 2014: Pew Fellowships |publisher=Pcah.us |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#List of Pew Fellows (1992-2015)|See a full history of Pew Fellowships recipients.]]

=== Advancement grants ===
Advancement grants are awarded to high-performing cultural organizations in the five-county Philadelphia region, and are intended to support organizations seeking to make lasting improvements to their programming, audience engagement, and financial health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcah.us/brochurepages/apply |website=pcah.us |title=Application Guidelines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the Center awarded its first Advancement grant to [[Opera Philadelphia]], for a multi-year project that helped the organization undertake audience research to further enhance the impact of its programs, as well as bring [[opera]] to a variety of audiences in unconventional places and unexpected ways.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcah.us/announcements/114_the_pew_center_for_arts_heritage_announces_2014_grants_for_philadelphia_artists_and_organizations|title=The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage 2014 Grant Recipients &amp; Pew Fellows : Newsroom : The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage |publisher=Pcah.us |year=2014 |accessdate=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Center awarded an Advancement grant to the [[Philadelphia Zoo]], for the next phase of its innovative trail system, which will add to an ever-changing and enriching experience for animals and audiences alike. (2014) &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2015, the Center awarded Advancement grants to the [[Philadelphia Chamber Music Society]] (PCMS), [[Curtis Institute of Music]],&lt;ref name="pcah.us1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcah.us/news/165_the_pew_center_for_arts_heritage_awards_advancement_grant_to_curtis_institute_of_music|title=The Pew Center for Arts &amp;amp; Heritage Awards Advancement Grant to Curtis Institute of Music – News – The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage|publisher=|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] (PMA).&lt;ref name="pcah.us1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcah.us/news/145_the_pew_center_for_arts_heritage_awards_advancement_grant_to_the_philadelphia_chamber_music_society|title=The Pew Center for Arts &amp;amp; Heritage Awards Advancement Grant to the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society – News – The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage|publisher=|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As hub for knowledge-sharing ==

Beyond its work as a cultural grantmaker in [[Philadelphia]], the Center has established itself as a hub for knowledge-sharing beyond the region, working in the areas of artistic expression and cultural interpretation. To engage in an international arts dialogue, the Center develops and hosts a range of activities, which concern artistic production, interpretation, and presentation. Activities include lectures, symposia, and workshops, and commissioned scholarship to explore critical issues in the fields served by the Center. The Center's website houses a series of online essays and interviews,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pewcenterarts.org/questionsofpractice|title=Questions of Practice |publisher=pewcenterarts.org |date= |accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with information about Center-funded events and grantees.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14026">Many people have claimed to have deciphered the [[Phaistos Disc]].

The claims may be categorized into linguistic [[decipherment]]s, identifying the language of the inscription, and non-linguistic decipherments. A purely ideographical reading is not linguistic in the strict sense: while it may reveal the meaning of the inscription, it would not allow us to identify the underlying language.

A large part of the claims are clearly [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]], if not bordering on the [[esoteric]]. Linguists are doubtful whether the inscription is sufficiently long to be unambiguously interpreted. It is possible that one of these decipherments is correct, and that, without further material in the same script, we will never know which.   Mainstream consensus tends towards the assumption of a [[Syllabary|syllabic]] script, possibly mixed with ideogram, like the known scripts of the epoch ([[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s, [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s, [[Linear B]]).

Some approaches attempt to establish a connection with known scripts, either the roughly contemporary [[Cretan hieroglyphs]] or [[Linear A]] native to Crete, or [[Egyptian hieroglyph|Egyptian]] or [[Anatolian hieroglyph|Anatolian]] hieroglyphics. Solutions postulating an independent Aegean script have also been proposed.

===="Proto-Ionic"====
Jean Faucounau, 1975 considers the script as the original invention of a Cycladic and maritime Aegean people, the [[proto-Ionians]], who had picked up the idea of a syllabic acrophonic script from Egypt at the time of the VIth Dynasty. He interprets the text as "[[proto-Ionic]]" Greek in syllabic writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faucounau|first=J.|title=The Phaistos Disk: A Statistical Decipherment|journal=Anistoriton|volume=4|issue=March 2000 (5th revision 27 May 2001)|accessdate=15 June 2013|url=http://www.anistor.gr/english/enback/v002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!------&lt;ref&gt;http://www.robotwisdom.com/science/phaistos/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iris-ward.com/DISK/2014-DISK.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=June 2013}}--&gt;

Reading  A-side first, inwards, he deciphers  a (funerary) hymn to one Arion, child of Argos, destroyer of Iasos. The language is a Greek dialect, written with considerable phonological ambiguities, comparable to the writing of  [[Mycenean Greek]] in [[Linear B]], hand-crafted by Faucounau to suit his reading, among other things postulating change of [[digamma]] to ''y'' and loss of labiovelars, but retention of Indo-European ''-sy-'' (in the genitive singular ''-osyo'', Homeric ''-oio'').
Faucounau has gathered evidence, which he asserts shows the existence of  [[proto-Ionians]] as early as the Early Bronze Age and of a proto-Ionic language with the required characteristics during the Late Bronze Age. He has presented this evidence in several papers and summarized it in his two books, of 1999 and 2001.

The text begins
:''ka-s (a)r-ko-syo / pa-yi-s / a-ri-o / a-a-mo / ka-s læ-yi-to / te-ri-o-s / te-tmæ-næ''
:''kas Argoio payis Arion ahamos. kas læi(s)ton dærios tetmænai''
:"Arion, the son of Argos, is without equal. He has distributed the spoil of battle."

Faucounau's solution was critically reviewed by Duhoux (2000), who in particular was sceptical about the consonantal sign ''s'' (D12) in the otherwise syllabic script, which appears word-finally in the sentence particle ''kas'', but not in nominatives like ''ahamos''. Most syllabaries would either omit ''s'' in both places, or use a syllable beginning with ''s'' in both places.

===Luwian===
Achterberg et al., 2004 interpreted the text as [[Anatolian hieroglyph]]ic, reading inwards, A-side first. The research group proposes a  14th-century date, based on a dating of  PH 1, the associated Linear A tablet.  The resulting text is a [[Luwian language|Luwian]] document of land ownership, addressed to one ''na-sa-tu'' ("[[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]"; Dative ''na-sa-ti'') of ''hi-ya-wa'' ([[Ahhiyawa]]). Toponyms read are ''pa-ya-tu'' (Phaistos), ''ra-su-ta'' ([[Lasithi]]), ''mi-SARU'' ([[Mesara]]), ''ku-na-sa'' ([[Knossos]]), ''sa&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-har-wa'' ([[Scheria]]), ''ri-ti-na'' ([[Rhytion]]). Another personal name read is ''i-du-ma-na'' ("[[Idomeneus]]"), governor of Mesara.

The strokes are read as a 46th glyph, expressing word-final ''ti''. The text begins

:''a-tu mi&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-SARU sa+ti / pa-ya-tu / u &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;na-sa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ti / u u-ri / a-tu hi-ya-wa''
:''atu Misari sati Payatu. u Nasati, u uri atu Hiyawa.''
:"In Mesara is  Phaistos. To Nestor, to the great [man] in Ahhiyawa."

'''Pimsleur Language Programs''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|m|z|l|ər}}) is an [[United States|American]] language learning company that develops and publishes courses based on the Pimsleur method.

==History==
Dr. [[Paul Pimsleur]], a professor and expert in applied linguistics and a founding member of the [[American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages]] (ACTFL),&lt;ref&gt;American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages "[[American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages]]"&lt;/ref&gt;  wrote the original 5 courses:  Speak &amp; Read Essential Greek (1963), Speak &amp; Read Essential French (1964), Speak &amp; Read Essential Spanish (1966), German Compact (1967), and [[Twi]] developed for the Peace Corps (1971).  The programs were originally called "A Tapeway Program"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Learn a Foreign Language|last=Pimsleur|first=Paul|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=978-1442369023|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Starting in 1969-70, having tried unsuccessfully to market the programs, Pimsleur gave them to Charles A.S. and Beverly Heinle at The Center for Curriculum Development in Philadelphia. The courses were repackaged and marketed as "CCD/Tapeway Programs". In 1974, Charles Heinle bought the rights to Pimsleur and set up Heinle &amp; Heinle Enterprises. In the 1980s, Heinle opened the Cassette Learning Centers, a stand in the [[Harvard Coop]], in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Prospective users were invited to sit down and experience "The Pimsleur Tape". "The Pimsleur Tapes" were published by Heinle &amp; Heinle Enterprises based in Concord, MA.

In 1983 [[Charles Heinle]] introduced SyberVision Systems founder [[Steven DeVore]] to the Pimsleur Russian program. DeVore, who had used a similar method to learn Finnish, exclusively licensed the Pimsleur programs. DeVore sold the programs in SyberVision's catalogs that were placed in the backseat pockets of major international air carriers and also mailed to 3 million SyberVision customers every month. SyberVision also produced and successfully sold Pimsleur programs via an infomercial that featured Beverly Pimsleur. SyberVision marketed the Pimsleur programs until 1997 before the license was sold to Simon &amp; Schuster.

In 1995, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] took on distribution to bookstores.  Before Heinle &amp; Heinle Enterprises sold Pimsleur to Simon &amp; Schuster in 1997, they added 27 new languages to the Pimsleur catalog. Since the acquisition, Simon &amp; Schuster Audio has added another 27 languages. Pimsleur's catalog currently stands at 59 languages and over 200 courses. The courses are still produced in Concord, MA and are available as digital audio downloads, CDs, and select languages are now available in interactive software format.

In 2005, digital editions of some languages were made available through various resellers.

In 2008, Pimsleur's first children's line, Speak Spanish with Dora &amp; Diego, was released in coordination with Nickelodeon's Nick Jr.

In 2008, [[Playaway]] was licensed to distribute the entire Pimsleur line to the military on pre-loaded players.

In 2010, Pimsleur donated its [[Haitian Creole]] course for free to relief and charity workers after the devastating [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake in Haiti]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/41664-random-house-simon-amp-schuster-harpercollins-contribute-to-haitian-relief-efforts.html|title=Publisher's weekly|last=Lynn|first=Andriani|date=|work=Random House, Simon &amp; Schuster, HarperCollins Contribute to Haitian Relief Efforts|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2010, Pimsleur partnered with the [[USO]], [[The Boston Foundation]] and Playaway to produce Pashto and Dari courses for U.S. troops serving in and being deployed to Afghanistan. This course is available for free to all military personnel.  Operation Speak Easy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uso.org/Programs/Operation-Speak-Easy/Operation-Speak-Easy-Program-Information.aspx|title=Operation Speak Easy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was funded by a Boston-area philanthropist and Pimsleur-enthusiast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-uso-and-pimsleur-launch-operation-speak-easy-102761719.html Press Release] September 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Pimsleur Digital line was relaunched in DRM-free format and at a new low price.

In 2011, Pimsleur donated 8 hours of its [[Japanese language|Japanese]] course to support aid agencies and volunteers in the wake of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|tsunami disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pimsleur-offers-free-japanese-language-course-to-aid-relief-and-recovery-efforts-in-japan-118604234.html Press Release] March 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Pimsleur released a new interactive software version of their Spanish, German, French, and Italian courses called Pimsleur Unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pimsleurunlimited.com|title=Pimsleur Unlimited|website=www.pimsleurunlimited.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Pimsleur celebrated its 50th anniversary with the launch of a new blog Pimsleur Speaks: On Language, Learning, and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pimsleurspeaks.pimsleur.com|title=Pimsleur Speaks Blog - On language, learning, and global pursuits|website=pimsleurspeaks.pimsleur.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Pimsleur donated 15 lessons of its [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] course to support aid agencies and volunteers in the wake of [[Typhoon Haiyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pimsleur-language-programs-offers-free-tagalog-language-course-to-aid-typhoon-haiyan-yolanda-relief-and-recovery-efforts-233310261.html|title=Pimsleur® Language Programs Offers Free Tagalog Language Course To Aid Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) Relief And Recovery Efforts|website=www.prnewswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Pimsleur released 3 additional Unlimited languages (Mandarin, Portuguese, and Russian) in its interactive software format.

In 2016, Pimsleur made its Unlimited product line available as digital downloads worldwide.

A '''regional language''' is a [[language]] spoken in an area of a [[sovereign state]], whether it be a small area, a [[Federalism|federated]] [[State (administrative division)|state]] or [[province]], or some wider area.

Internationally, for the purposes of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], ''"regional or minority languages" means languages that are: ''
#''traditionally used within a given territory of a State by nationals of that State who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the State's population; and ''
#''different from the official language(s) of that State''&lt;ref name=COE-Charter&gt;{{cite web|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm|website=Council of Europe|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of regional or minority languages must not be confused with recognition as an [[official language]].

==Influence of number of speakers==
There are many cases when a regional language can claim greater numbers of speakers than certain languages which happen to be [[official language]]s of sovereign states. For example, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (a regional language of [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and [[France]], albeit the [[national language]] of [[Andorra]]) has more speakers than [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Danish language|Danish]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=Catalan only has 4M L1 speakers}}  A similar situation exists in China, where [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], spoken in southern [[Jiangsu]], northern, and the general area of [[Shanghai]] [[Zhejiang]] by more than 90 million speakers, is spoken natively by more speakers than [[French language|French]]; [[Yue Chinese]], a [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese regional variety]] spoken in [[Guangdong]], [[Hong Kong]] and nearby areas in [[China]] with more than 60 million local and overseas speakers (North America, parts of [[Malaysia]]), outnumbers [[Italian language|Italian]] in number of speakers. Dialects of the [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialect group have over 70 million speakers, mainly in [[Fujian]] and in nearby [[Taiwan]], but also in the [[Southeast Asian]] countries of [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].

==Relationship with official languages==
In some cases, a regional language may be closely related to the state's main language or [[official language]]. For example:

*The [[Frisian languages]] spoken in the Netherlands and Germany, which belong to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] family.
*The [[Modern Gutnish|Gutnish language]], a regional language spoken in [[Gotland]] and related to the Swedish language.
*[[Westrobothnian]] is another Swedish regional language native to historical [[Westrobothnia]].
*[[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] in [[Kurdistan]], which is an autonomous region in [[Northern Iraq]], Northwestern [[Iran]] and southeastern [[Turkey]].
*[[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] in northern Iraq, northeastern [[Syria]], southeastern Turkey and northwestern Iran.
* Regional varieties in China are considered part of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[macrolanguage]], with the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] being the most commonly spoken and [[Standard Chinese]] based on the [[Beijing dialect]].
**[[Wu Chinese|Wu]], in [[Shanghai]], southern [[Jiangsu]], [[Zhejiang]] and eastern [[Jiangxi]].
**[[Yue Chinese]], in [[Guangdong]], parts of [[Guangxi]], [[Hainan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], [[Cantonese]] is the regional standard variety for Yue-speaking areas
**[[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], in parts of [[Guangdong]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Fujian]], and [[Taiwan]]
**[[Min Chinese|Min]], in [[Fujian]], [[Taiwan]], eastern [[Guangdong]] and [[Hainan]].
**[[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], in [[Hunan]].
**[[Gan Chinese|Gan]], in [[Jiangxi]].
*[[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], a regional language of [[Poland]].
*[[Limburgish]], a regional language in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and Belgium, has around one million speakers and is closely related to [[Luxembourgish]], [[South Guelderish]] and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]].
*[[Low German]] (also referred to as Low Saxon), an officially recognized regional language in Germany and the Netherlands, the direct descendant of [[Old Saxon]]. Sometimes (e.g. by nds and nds-nl Wikipedia) considered two languages divided by today’s Netherlands–German border on account of Dutch influences in the west and German influences in the east; closely related to [[Frisian languages|Frisian]], more distantly to [[German language|German]].
*[[Scots language|Scots]], a regional language of [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] (both part of the [[United Kingdom]], and where it is known as [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] in the latter location), belongs to the same family of [[West Germanic languages]] as [[English language|English]].
* [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]], regional languages spoken in [[Italy]] which also belong to the same family of standard Italian ([[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]]).
* Regional languages of [[Languages of Spain|Spain]] and [[Languages of Portugal|Portugal]]:
**[[Aranese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], and [[Galician language|Galician]] are each, in the regions where they are the autochthonous language, co-official in status with [[Spanish language|Castilian]] (Spanish) which is official everywhere in the [[Kingdom of Spain]].
**[[Asturian language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]] are recognized (but unofficial) in [[Asturias]] and [[Castile and León]] (Spain), while [[Mirandese]] is co-official with Portuguese in [[Miranda do Douro]] (Portugal). These Romance languages are classified under the term [[Astur-Leonese linguistic group|Astur-Leonese languages]]. [[Astur-Leonese]] is closely related to both [[Castilian language|Castilian]] and [[Galician language|Galician]], which itself is most closely related to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is an [[Occitano-Romance languages|Occitano-Romance language]].
**[[Occitan]], most widely spoken across the Pyrenees in France and Catalonia, together with Catalan, forms a subgroup of Romance languages linguistically intermediate between [[Gallo-Romance languages|French]] and the [[Ibero-Romance languages]] of Spain and Portugal. [[Aranese]] is a subdialect of [[Gascon language|Gascon]]
*[[Tibetic languages]]
**[[Amdo tibetan language]] have regional official status in [[amdo]] or [[Qinghai]].
**[[Standard Tibetan]] is currently based on [[Lhasa Tibetan]].
*[[Võro language|Võro]] and [[Seto language|Seto]], regional languages of [[Estonia]], are either dialects of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] or separate [[Finnic languages]] as Estonian.
*[[Walloon language|Walloon]], a regional language of France and [[Belgium]], belongs to the same family of [[Oïl languages]] as [[French language|French]].
*[[Hindi language|Hindi]] and English are the [[official languages]] of [[India]]'s [[Government of India|Central Government]].
** [[Languages of India|Indian regional languages]] are: [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dogri language|Dogri]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Meitei language|Manipuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]], [[Urdu]]

In other cases, a regional language may be very different from the state's main language or official language. For example:

*[[Basque language|Basque]], a regional language spoken in [[Spain]] and [[France]] ([[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]).
*[[Breton language|Breton]], a regional Celtic language spoken in [[France]] ([[Brittany]]).
*[[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] is an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] language, and one of the many [[Native American languages]] spoken in the [[United States|U.S.]] State of [[Oklahoma]].
*[[Cornish language|Cornish]], a non-living regional Celtic language originating in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Cornwall]]).
*[[Corsican language|Corsican]], a regional language in [[France]] ([[Corsica]]) closely related to the [[Tuscan dialect]] of [[Italian language|Italian]].
*[[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], a regional [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in [[Moldova]].
*[[Livonian language|Livonian]], a regional language of the [[Finnic languages|Finnic family]] spoken in [[Latvia]].
*[[Resian dialect|Resian]], a dialect of [[Slovene language|Slovene]] spoken in [[Italy]] ([[Resia, Friuli|Resia valley]]).
*[[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], a regional [[Romance languages|Romance language]] spoken in [[Italy]] ([[Sardinia]]).
*[[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], a regional [[Celtic language]] spoken in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Scotland]]).
*[[Sorbian language|Sorbian]], a regional [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] language of [[Germany]].
*[[Welsh language|Welsh]], a regional [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language spoken in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Wales]]).

==Official languages as regional languages==
An official language of a country may also be spoken as a regional language in a region of a neighbouring country. For example:
*[[Afrikaans]], an official language of [[South Africa]], is a regional language of [[Namibia]].
*[[Cantonese]], one of the official standard varieties in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] (both [[Special administrative region (People's Republic of China)|special administrative region]]s of the [[People's Republic of China]]), is used as a regional language of the province of [[Guangdong Province|Guangdong]], [[People's Republic of China]].
*[[Catalan language|Catalan]], the official language of [[Andorra]], is a regional language in [[Spain]] ([[Catalonia]], [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Valencian Community]]), [[France]] ([[Pyrénées Orientales]]) and [[Italy]] ([[Alghero]], [[Sardinia]]).
*[[German language|German]], an official language of [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Switzerland]], is a regional language in [[Italy]] ([[South Tyrol]]), [[Poland]] ([[Silesia]]), [[France]] ([[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]), [[Denmark]] and [[Namibia]].
*[[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]], one of the official language in [[Taiwan]], is spoken as a regional language of the province of [[Guangdong Province|Guangdong]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Fujian]], [[People's Republic of China]].
*[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], a [[Uralic languages|Uralic language]] and official in [[Hungary]], is a regional language of [[Romania]] whose official language, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is a Romance language.
*[[Irish Gaelic|Irish]], the first official language of the [[Republic of Ireland]], is a regional language in [[Northern Ireland]], part of the [[United Kingdom]].
*[[Korean language|Korean]], the official language of [[Korea]], is a regional language in [[People's Republic of China]] ([[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]]).
*[[Malay Language|Malay]], the official language of [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and [[Singapore]], is a regional language in [[Indonesia]] ([[Riau Province]]).
*[[Russian language|Russian]], the official language of the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Belarus]], is a regional language of  [[Abkhazia]], [[South Ossetia]] and other entities.

'''Robert McCulloch [[Missionary Society of St. Columban|SSC]]''' is an [[Australian people|Australian]] priest and member of the [[Missionary Society of St. Columban]], who served in Pakistan from 1978 to 2011. He was decorated by the [[Government of Pakistan]] for his services to health and education in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/336573/jesus-and-mary-convent-principal-to-be-honoured-with-sitara-quaid-e-azam/|work= The Express Tribune|title=Jesus and Mary Convent Principal to be honoured with Sitara-quaid-e-azam|date=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
McCulloch was born in 1946 in [[Alexandra, Victoria|Alexandra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to Bruce John McCulloch and Jean Frances Crowe. He was educated at St Patrick's School, [[Mentone, Victoria|Mentone]], Our Lady of the Assumption Parish Primary School, [[Cheltenham]], and [[St Bede's College (Mentone)|St Bede's College, Mentone]].&lt;ref name=FE&gt;''The Far East'', September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCulloch entered the Society of St Columban in 1964, spending his initial year of probation in [[Sassafras, Victoria]]. He began his studies at St Columban's Seminary in [[Sydney]] in 1965 and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest in 1970. In 1976 he received a [[Master of Arts]] in Church History from [[The Catholic University of America]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=FE /&gt; Since 1978 he has worked to increase the education and basic health care of the poor and mainly non-Christian people of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=cn&gt;[http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=28313 CathNews 18 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work in Pakistan==
McCulloch has served in two [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hyderabad in Pakistan|Diocese of Hyderabad]] parishes: [[Kotri]], a rural area {{convert|100|miles}} east of [[Karachi]]; and [[Machar Colony]], a community of 300 Catholic families in the slums of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. After a spell in [[Badin]], he started working with the semi-nomadic [[Hindu]] tribe of [[Parkari Kohli]] in [[Tharparkar District]]. During this period, McCulloch helped the tribe design an [[alphabet]] for their language, for which he called on two linguists for their help. After the local population had opted for using the [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] alphabet, with a few minor changes, people gathered proverbs and sayings and launched the first Parkari Kohli newspaper, ''Prem Paracha''. In this he helped to save the native language and culture.&lt;ref name=trib /&gt;

McCulloch has had as a goal of his ministry the improvement of health care in the country. He sits on the administrative board for [[St. Elizabeth's Hospital, Hyderabad]]. He has established an outreach medical program at the hospital to provide vaccinations for infants and children, medical care for their mothers, and diagnosis and care of tuberculosis patients.

McCulloch has also developed schools in Pakistan that are now attended by more than 550 children.He has chaired the Board of Governors for the Centre of Academic Excellence,&lt;ref name=trib /&gt; a project he initiated in 2007 to provide educational, spiritual, moral and personal formation for 100 Catholic boys.

McCulloch has lectured at the [[National Catholic Institute of Theology]] in [[Karachi, Pakistan]] in liturgy and church history.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

McCulloch has established a [[palliative care]] unit. It is the first home-based palliative care unit for the terminally ill in Pakistan. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columban.org.au/Archives/features/2010/Mission-in-Pakistan/ St Columban's Mission Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[St. Vincent de Paul Society]] of Victoria, through its overseas development initiatives, is providing ongoing financial support for McCulloch's health and educational programs.&lt;ref name=cn /&gt;

In October 2012, the head of the Vatican's [[Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization]], Archbishop [[Rino Fisichella]] launched Parts I and II of the [[Catholic Catechism]] in [[Urdu]]. McCulloch was involved in its translation from 2004 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.therecord.com.au/news/in-depth/australia-could-teach-pakistan-a-thing-or-two-about-fundamentalism-fr-robert-mcculloch/ | newspaper=The Record | date=18 October 2012 | title=Australia could teach Pakistan a thing or two about fundamentalism: Fr Robert McCulloch | first=Robert | last=Hiini | accessdate=4 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Emmanuel Neno]] this work was completed in 2014. The Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization has approved  the Urdu translation and authorised its publication. The translation took 13 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/1614/0/pakistan-s-catholics-anticipate-newly-approved-urdu-catechism | title= Pakistan's Catholics anticipate newly approved Urdu catechism  | first=Ellen | last=Teague | work=The Tablet | date=12 January 2015 | accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award==
On 15 February 2012, the President of Pakistan approved conferment of ''Sitara'' class of the [[Nishan-e-Quaid-i-Azam]] on McCulloch for his services to Pakistan in health and education.&lt;ref name=trib&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/400801/from-australia-with-love-father-mcculloch-finds-his-true-calling-in-pakistan/ From Australia, with love: Father McCulloch finds his true calling in Pakistan], Express Tribune&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2012, more than 600 people gathered at [[St. Anthony's Parish (Karachi)|St Anthony's Church]] in Karachi for a special [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] to celebrate Sister [[John Berchmans Conway]] [[Religious of Jesus and Mary|RJM]] and McCulloch receiving the country's highest civilian award.

McCulloch has been transferred to [[Rome]] and is serving as the [[Procurator (Catholic Church)|Procurator General]] of the Society of St Columban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/2012/03/27/government-rewards-church-people/ UCANews 27 March 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 2012, McCulloch was inducted into the St Bede's Old Collegians Hall of Fame.

Simmons was elected Brown's first female president in November 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/11/opinion/a-new-president-for-brown-university.html?pagewanted=print "A New President for Brown University"], ''New York Times'', November 11, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; assuming that office in the fall of 2001. She also held appointments as a professor in the Departments of Comparative Literature and Africana Studies. In 2002, ''[[Newsweek]]'' selected her as a Ms. Woman of the Year, while in 2001, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named her as America's best college president. According to a March 2009 poll by ''[[The Brown Daily Herald]]'', Simmons had more than an 80% approval rating among Brown undergraduates.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Moser and Seth Motel, [http://www.browndailyherald.com/2009/03/30/students-support-fall-weekend/ "Students support 'Fall Weekend'"], ''The Brown Daily Herald'', March 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Brown, she headed [[Smith College]], a [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] and the largest women's college in the United States, beginning in 1995.

She earned her bachelor's degree, on scholarship, from [[Dillard University]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], in 1967. She went on to earn her master's and doctorate in [[Romance languages|Romance literature]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1970 and 1973, respectively.

==Early academic positions==

Simmons was an assistant professor of French at the [[University of New Orleans]] from 1973-1976 and Assistant Dean of the UNO College of Liberal Arts from 1975-76. She moved to [[California State University, Northridge]] in 1977 as administrative coordinator of its NEH Liberal Studies Project. From 1978-79, she was acting director of CSU-Northridge's International Programs and visiting associate professor of Pan-African Studies.&lt;ref name="21, 2017"&gt;[https://www.pvamu.edu/president/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/dr-ruth-simmons-cv.pdf|accessed=December 21, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simmons moved to the [[University of Southern California]] in 1979 as assistant dean of graduate studies, and then as associate dean of graduate studies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121015070436/http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/7294.html USC Perspectives 10/08/01.]&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Princeton University]] in 1983 and served as assistant dean of faculty and then associate dean of faculty from 1986 to 1990. Simmons served as provost at [[Spelman College]] from 1990 to 1991 and returned to Princeton as its vice provost from 1992 to 1995.&lt;ref name="21, 2017"/&gt;

==Smith College presidency==
In 1995 Simmons became the first [[African-American]] woman to head a major college or university&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/obama-legacy/first-black-heroes.html=print First Black Heroes - Successful African Americans] ''Washington Post'', William Wan, April 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; when she was selected as president of [[Smith College]], which she led until 2001. As president of Smith College, Simmons started the first engineering program in a U.S. woman's college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/newssmith/NSSpr01/timeline.html|title=The Simmons Years|access-date=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brown University presidency==
Simmons became president of Brown in October 2001, succeeding [[Gordon Gee]]. At Brown, she completed a $1.4 billion initiative - the largest in Brown's history - known as ''Boldly Brown: The Campaign for Academic Enrichment'' in order to enhance Brown's academic programs. In 2004, former Brown student [[Sidney E. Frank]] made the largest aggregate monetary contribution to Brown in its history in the amount of $120 million. The Frank gifts were principally devoted to scholarship assistance to Brown students and to Brown's programs in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/684/40/|title=The Giver|last=|first=|date=|website=Brown Alumni Magazine|access-date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2007, philanthropist [[Warren Alpert]] who made a similarly generous contribution to strengthen the programs of [[Alpert Medical School|The Warren Alpert Medical School]] of Brown University in the amount of $100 million, matching the core portion of the Sidney Frank gift to Brown. As reported in a May 22, 2009, press release, Brown chancellor [[Thomas J. Tisch]] announced early accomplishment of the $1.4 billion fundraising campaign and the continued pursuit of specific subsidiary goals in support of endowments for student scholarships, the Brown faculty and internationalization programs through the originally planned campaign completion date of December 31, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2009/05/campaign "‘Boldly Brown’ Campaign Crosses the $1.4-Billion Mark; Work Continues"]. Press Release from Brown University, May 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 orientation meeting with parents, Simmons denied interest in the presidency of [[Harvard University]], which at the time was headed by an interim president, [[Derek Bok]]. Nevertheless, a 2007 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, featuring a photograph of Simmons, reported that the [[Harvard Corporation]], responsible for selecting the university's replacement for former president [[Lawrence Summers]], had been given a list of "potential candidates" that included her name.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Finder,
 [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/08/education/08harvard.html?ex=1325912400&amp;en=0206445d233ad9fd&amp;ei=5088 "Headhunters at Harvard May Pick a Woman"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, Simmons was invited to deliver the 60th Annual Reading of the historic 1790 [[George Washington]] [[s:Letter to Touro Synagogue|Letter to Touro Synagogue]] at the [[Touro Synagogue|Synagogue]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] in response to [[Moses Seixas]] on the subject of religious pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2007/08/keynote-address "Brown President Ruth J. Simmons to Speak at Touro Synagogue"]. Press Release from Brown University, August 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Simmons announced that she would step down from her position as Brown President at the end of the 2011-12 academic year, originally saying she would remain at Brown as a professor of comparative literature and Africana studies. She was succeeded as Brown President on June 30, 2012, by [[Christina Paxson]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Daddona, [http://pbn.com/RI-college-leaders-paid-well-compared-to-peers,97788?print=1 "R.I. college leaders paid well compared to peers"], ''Providence Business News'', June 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goldman Sachs role and compensation==
Simmons earned annual compensation of over $300,000 from [[Goldman Sachs]] (on top of her annual salary from Brown of over $500,000) while serving on the Goldman board of directors during the [[late-2000s financial crisis]]; in addition, she left the Goldman board (which she had joined in 2000) in 2009 with over $4.3 million in Goldman stock.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Graham Bowley, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/business/02brown.html=print "Questions at Brown on Ruth Simmons's Role at Goldman"], ''New York Times'', March 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.browndailyherald.com/2011/10/10/simmons-defends-goldman-ties/ Simmons defends Goldman ties&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During her term on Goldman's board, she also served on the compensation committee of Goldman's ten-person board, which decided how large Goldman executives' post-crash bonuses would be; these bonuses included a $68 million bonus for the company's chairman and CEO, [[Lloyd C. Blankfein]], in 2007 and a $9 million bonus in 2009 after Goldman received money in the federal TARP bailout.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The revelations of Simmons's role received intense criticism from both alumni and students, with a then-sophomore stating that Simmons's actions "brought shame on the university."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Simmons was cited in the 2010 film ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]'', as an example of the conflicts of interest between university economics departments and deregulation of financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;''Inside Job'', [[Charles H. Ferguson|Charles Ferguson]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transnational initiatives at Brown==
{{peacock|section|date=September 2011}}

As the wealth that the founding Brown family contributed to the university was based in part on the [[triangular trade|triangular slave trade]], in 2003, Simmons established the University Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice to examine this complex history and make recommendations for how the university might approach the relevant issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brown.edu/Research/Slavery_Justice/ Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice] from Brown University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frances FitzGerald, 
[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/09/12/050912fa_fact1 “Peculiar Institutions"], ''The New Yorker'', September 12, 2005, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[https://www.brown.edu/Research/Slavery_Justice/documents/SlaveryAndJustice.pdf Report of the Brown University Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice]'' was subsequently published. On February 16, 2007, at an event celebrating the 200-year anniversary of the passage of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act of 1807]] and the involvement of [[Cambridge University]] alumni [[William Wilberforce]], [[Thomas Clarkson]] and [[William Pitt the Younger]], Simmons delivered a lecture at [[St. John's College, Cambridge]], entitled ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090815000009/http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/chapel_and_choir/bicentenary_2007/antislavery_conference/ Hidden in Plain Sight: Slavery and Justice in Rhode Island]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/chapel_and_choir/bicentenary_2007/antislavery_conference/ "Slavery: Then and Now"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815000009/http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/chapel_and_choir/bicentenary_2007/antislavery_conference/ |date=2009-08-15 }}.

The bicentenary of the British [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolition of the slave trade]] was also commemorated at [[Oxford University]], notably at [[Rhodes House]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford Today]]'', [http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/2006-07/v19n2/01.shtml Vol. 19, No. 2.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113182930/http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/2006-07/v19n2/01.shtml |date=2009-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Simmons appointed [[David Kennedy (jurist)|David W. Kennedy]], the former Manley O. Hudson Professor of Law at [[Harvard Law School]], as vice president for international affairs. In addition to supporting the leadership of the [[Watson Institute for International Studies]], the new university officer will lead a multidisciplinary advanced research project in the field of global law, governance and social thought to strengthen the University's international work in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2007/10/international-affairs "David Kennedy Named Vice President for International Affairs"]. Press Release on International Affairs from Brown University, October 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an additional element of Simmons' leadership of Brown's international efforts, Brown and [[Banco Santander]] of [[Spain]] inaugurated an annual series of International Advanced Research Institutes to convene a rising generation of scholars from emerging and developing countries at Brown in a signing ceremony on November 13, 2008, at the [[John Hay Library]] between Brown provost [[David Kertzer]] and [[Emilio Botin]], chairman of Banco Santander.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watsoninstitute.org/news_detail.cfm?id=992 Watson Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Simmons: "To be at the forefront of research today means being in conversation with global peers. The Brown Institutes provide exciting opportunities to encounter new ideas, build collegiate relationships and enrich faculty development for young scholars and teachers from around the world".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/International_Affairs/initiative/index.html Brown International Advanced Research Institutes (BIARI)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Simmons traveled to India as part of a major program called the Year of India which is dedicated to the improvement of understanding of Indian history, politics, education and culture among Brown students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/2010/03/29212905/Ruth-J-Simmons--We-want-our-s.html Ruth J.

{{no sources|date= May 2017}}
Many people with severe physical or cognitive impairment use one or more switches to access computers. A switch is an [[assistive technology]] device that replaces the need to use a [[computer keyboard]] or a [[mouse (computing)|mouse]].

==Types of switch==
[[Image:Access device.JPG|thumb|right|An example of a single switch]]
[[Image:IMG 0096 Foot Switch.JPG|thumb|right|A foot switch]]

Switches come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the action used to activate them (such as [[sip-and-puff|sip-puff]], pushing, pulling, pressing, blinking or squeezing). Switches also vary in their colour and aesthetics. For push or press switches, the amount of force required to operate them varies or in some cases can be adjusted. Some switches may only require a touch (not even a press), some may be designed to be kicked. 
A switch can be operated by almost any body part that is able to produce consistent and voluntary movement..

==Connecting a switch==
A switch cannot be plugged directly into a computer. Instead a Switch Interface is required to bridge the gap between the switch and the computer's [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[serial port|serial]], or [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] port.

==What can be accomplished with a switch==
Switches can be suitable for people with cognitive difficulties, developmental delays and physical limitations. In the simplest use they are a clear and simple way to demonstrate action/reaction often referred to as cause and effect. In the more complex use they could be the means to control mobility or interact with the environment.
There are a variety of motivating switch activities that can be used to assess and develop a person's understanding of choice and timing.

Switches can be linked to a variety of devices, for example: [[Augmentative and Alternative Communication]] devices, switch adapted toys, switch interfaces for computer access, SMART Technology, sensory room equipment and [[environmental control device]]s

==Switch types==
The smallest amount of interaction that can be provided with a switch is binary switch input, as holding down the switch for a certain amount of time may be impossible for a [[Sip-and-puff|sip and puff]] device or painful for someone with arthritis. 
Some users will prefer to use one switch, others will prefer to use two and sometimes more. For users who are using their switches to access simple activities an additional switch brings about an option of choice. It also allows two users to work collaboratively or to play against each other.

Considering multiple switch access is important for users accessing more advanced activities through [[switch access scanning]]. This is usually determined by their physical capabilities. A single switch requires less physical control and is usually less tiring to access but it reduces scanning options and usually leads to a slower rate of input. Single-switch scanning also requires much greater concentration. Two-switch scanning enables a range of scanning options, including row-and-column and overscan. These can greatly increase input rates and can make using a computer or electronic assistive device far more comfortable and efficient.

'''Francisco Marroquín University''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Universidad Francisco Marroquín''), also known by the abbreviation '''UFM''', is a private, secular university in [[Guatemala City]], [[Guatemala]]. It describes its mission as "to teach and disseminate the ethical, legal, and overall economic principles of a society of free and responsible persons."

According to [[Milton Friedman]], it is "one of the leading universities in [[Latin America]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php?title=Interview_with_Rose_and_Milton_Friedman|title=Interview with Rose and Milton Friedman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was founded in 1971 by [[Manuel F. Ayau]], known as Muso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muso|url=http://muso.ufm.edu/en/index.php/Main_Page|publisher=UFM|accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its namesake is [[Francisco Marroquín]], an early bishop of [[Guatemala]] and translator of Central American languages, but the university does not follow any of his teachings or philosophies. Started by members of [[Center for Economic and Social Studies (Guatemala)|Center for Economic and Social Studies]] with $40,000 and 125 students, UFM counts 2700 undergraduate students and 1500 graduate students as of 2009. The philosophy statement says that "universities need to place themselves beyond the conflicts of their time so that science and academic freedom – which humankind will need at all times – may be preserved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ufm.edu/images/b/bb/IdearioUFM.pdf|title=Philosophy Statement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degrees==
In Guatemala, as in most of the rest of Latin America, the educational system concentrates students in their academic or professional discipline from the time of admission. Following secondary school, students are admitted to a particular school or department and, beginning the first year, they follow a prescribed program leading to a degree.

===Undergraduate===
Licenciatura degree (Licentiate): in most of Latin America, the degree most commonly awarded to undergraduate students is the licenciatura. Traditionally, it includes several more academic credits than does a B.A. or a B.S.
* Disciplines: architecture, business administration, clinical nutrition, economics, education, international relations, law, political studies, public accounting and auditing, psychology (clinical and industrial).&lt;ref name="UFM at a Glance"&gt;{{cite web|title=UFM at a Glance|url=https://www.ufm.edu/index.php/At_a_Glance|publisher=UFM|accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* M.D./D.D.S.: Students are admitted directly into medical and dental schools as high-school graduates. Then follows a three-year program of basic science studies after which students receive a B.S. degree. It is followed by four years of medical or three of dental studies and one year of internship for medical students (none for dental students). Then, graduates receive an M.D. or D.D.S. degree.
* Associate degree: disciplines include art history and personnel administration.&lt;ref name="UFM at a Glance"/&gt;
* ''Profesorado'' degree: the ''profesorado'' is a specialized degree for secondary school teachers. In many cases, it is required for employment: disciplines include art history, computer studies, social sciences and language.

===Graduate===
Master's degree disciplines: business administration (MBA); virtual business administration (online MBA); real estate project management (MAPI)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.ufm.edu/maestrias/|title=Maestrías  - Escuela de Negocios {{!}} Escuela de Negocios|website=en.ufm.edu|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;; entrepreneurial economics; [[international political economy]]; international relations, finance and taxation (MFIN); management of human resources; social sciences.&lt;ref name="UFM at a Glance"/&gt;

* [[Gordon Tullock]], co-founder of the school of Public Choice
* [[Sir Alan Walters]], an economic advisor to [[Margaret Thatcher]].

At the beginning of the 2000s, the library started offering access to digital resources. It is subscribed to other services in this area including EBSCOHost databases, Oxford Scholarship Online, xRefer Plus and UpToDate, MDConsult and others.

The library [http://noticias.ufm.edu/index.php/Biblioteca_recibi%C3%B3_donaci%C3%B3n_Elsevier was chosen] among all the libraries around the World within the 10 libraries to receive the Elsevier donation of 670 titles.
The library site [http://noticias.ufm.edu/index.php?title=Biblioteca_von_Mises_recibi%C3%B3_premios_de_Arroba_de_Oro received] the ''Arroba de Oro'' award in Guatemala for the best educational website.

The [[Henry Hazlitt]] Center co-ordinates the courses of Economic Process (I, II and III) and Social Philosophy (Hayek and the Austrian School) that are offered to all undergraduate students in all schools. It also offers seminars and lectures for professors in order to improve their academic and pedagogic skills.

The [[Center for the Study of Capitalism]]  was founded in 2009 with the support of the university as a private, secular, coeducational, nonresidential, nonprofit center of study. It organizes socratic dialogue sessions with high school students and young entrepreneurs to study philosophical values as guides to excellence in thinking and action. Since its foundation, more than 1000 participants have joined philosophical discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitalismo.ufm.edu|title=Centro del Capitalismo – Universidad Francisco Marroquín – Centro del Capitalismo|website=Centro del Capitalismo – Universidad Francisco Marroquín}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arboretum awakens and cultivates the love for nature and conservation of plants and animals in the campus. The land of the university is a remnant of the Montano Forest of pine and Encino trees that used to cover Guatemala. The beautiful gardens  have been carefully designed to integrate native and exotic species, which have been admired by students and visitors. Since the beginning, preservation of the forest was a priority, to the point that the library's architectural design of the buildings was done to keep the trees as intact as possible.

The New Media digital library includes 1,500 hours of digitized and indexed educational material, and receives over 1000 visitors daily from around the world.

The [[Museo Popol Vuh]] Museum offers its visitors a unique journey through Guatemalan history, illustrated by one of the best collections of prehispanic and colonial art in the country. The museum is a scientific, private, nonprofit organization for the conservation, investigation and the popularization of Guatemala's cultural and archeological heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popolvuh.ufm.edu |title=Museo Popol Vuh, Universidad Francisco Marroquín, Guatemala |publisher=Popolvuh.ufm.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lienzo de Quauhquechollan]]  is a large Nahua painting on cotton cloth (lienzo) that belongs to the pre-Hispanic tradition of documenting stories of migrations and conquests within a geographic context. Considered the first map of Guatemala, it is one of the few sources from the 16th century that tell of the military campaigns of Jorge de Alvarado in 1527. A digitally-restored copy and an animated recreation of the story, exhibited at the campus, are based on the research done by Dutch archaeologist Florine Asselbergs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lienzo.ufm.edu/en/ellienzo.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310021002/http://lienzo.ufm.edu/en/ellienzo.asp|accessdate=2012-03-19|title=The Lienzo|archivedate=2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ITA Scholarship Program (an acronym for Impulso al Talento Academico) stands for "promotion of academic talent." The program grants scholarships for undergraduate degrees to the poorest, most highly qualified and most motivated students. The scholarship covers full tuition and fees, room and board, medical insurance, and a stipend for public transportation, books, and basic personal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ita.ufm.edu/en |title=ITA |publisher=Ita.ufm.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions and landmarks==
Following [[Manuel Ayau]], in 1972, the first class of students that entered to the university presented a pair of bronzed shoes to the founding rector, Ayau, as a joke. Since then the shoes are kept at the rector's office; as a way to remember to follow Ayau's steps and those of the founders of the university on the road to freedom.

Honoring the champions of freedom, it has awarded ''honoris causa'' doctorates to scientists, intellectuals, businessmen, artists and others who have contributed to the sciences, the arts, the world of business and the cause of freedom. Four Nobel Prize winners have accepted an honorary degree awarded by the university: [[Friedrich Hayek]]; [[Milton Friedman]], [[James M. Buchanan]], and [[Vernon L. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;See the entire list, here
&lt;https://www.ufm.edu/index.php/Doctorados_Honoris_Causa&gt; (in Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the House of Freedom, the library is named alter [[Ludwig von Mises]]; there are the Friedrich A. Hayek Auditorium and the Milton Friedman Auditorium. The department in charge of the courses of Social Philosophy and Economic Process is named after [[Henry Hazlitt]]. There is a Freedom Plaza and a terrace named after [[Rose Friedman]].

Mises's birthday, September 29, is celebrated by Professor Joseph Keckeissen's students with a Viennese party by the second semester of every year. It includes theatrical presentations, singing and dancing. Keckeissen attended Mises's Seminar in New York City and he began the theatrical tradition in the 1980s with the Guttenberg Society.

Commencement ceremony – On May and November, UFM celebrates commencement ceremonies. During these the graduating students receive their titles and diplomas. On that occasion the Board of Directors award the honoris causa doctorates.

Honor graduates ceremony – The night before the commencement ceremony, at UFM, they celebrate a ceremony and a cocktail party in praise of those students which graduate with honors, and to celebrate excellence (in Spanish). The honors awarded are Cum Laude, for those who obtained grades between 85 and 90: Magna Cum Laude, for those who obtained grades between 91 and 94; and Summa Cum Laude, for those who accumulated an average between 95 and 100.

Inaugural Lesson – The Inaugural Lesson enjoys a long academic tradition. At Universidad Francisco Marroquín it is a Commencement ceremony and an opportunity to get together the faculty and the students around the philosophy of freedom presented by a local or visiting professor. The first Inaugural Lesson, at UFM, was presented by vicerector emeritus Rigoberto Juárez-Paz, and it was about Plato's Academy.

===Landmarks on campus===
Marroquín's bust, as the university is named after Bishop Marroquín, because he was the first prelate ordained in America in the colonial times. During his tenure as bishop, Marroquín took care of the rights of indigenous people and helped fund the first university in Central America.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Marroquín's bust was donated to the university by Trustee Félix Montes in January 1975.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The sculptor is José Nicolás. However, the university is nondenominational.

Hayek's bust, as he was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1974. He visited 1977, when he was awarded an ''honoris causa'' doctorate in social sciences. The House of Freedom, the auditorium of the Academic Building, is named for Hayek. His bust is located at the Ludwig von Mises Library and was donated by Walter S. Morris, of [[Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]], in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Mises's bust, as he was a luminary of the [[Austrian School]]. He visited Guatemala when he was invited by the Centro de Estudios Económico-Sociales and supported for the foundation of the university.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} His bust was donated by the class of 1975 by the School of Business.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The [[Atlas Libertas]] is a bas relief placed on the main façade of the UFM Business School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlaslibertas.ufm.edu/en/descripcion/|title=descripción - Atlas libertas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high-relief sculpture of a human figure supporting the universe seen from the back from head to hip. The universe is represented by a series of semicircles (abstract planets and gear mechanisms). The sculpture is made of brass plate with a cyan-colored finish, resembling oxidized copper.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The Central Garden (renamed the Garden of Manuel Ayau) ismodeled after a Greek amphitheater and hosts the commencement ceremonies. The bust of Marroquin is the focus of the garden.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In 2011, after the death of founder Ayau, it was renamed to honor him.

The Academic Building's Garden is surrounded by classrooms and the administration offices, seven stories high. Nevertheless, with an air of a [[Japanese garden]] and pond, it is an oasis of tranquility, removed from the exuberance of the campus itself.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

There is a fountain at the Ludwig von Mises Library, near the Central Garden.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Rationale==
In 2012, there were estimated to be over 270,000 Americans with long-term [[spinal cord]] injuries, of whom around 21 percent suffer from complete paraplegia.&lt;ref name=UAlabama&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nscisc.uab.edu/PublicDocuments/fact_figures_docs/Facts%202012%20Feb%20Final.pdf|title=Spinal Cord Injury Facts &amp; Figures (PDF)|publisher=[[University of Alabama]]: National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center|date=February 2012|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lifetime cost of care and lost productivity for each paraplegic ranges from US$1.4 million to $2.2 million.&lt;ref name=UAlabama/&gt; However, since the late 2000s, [[robotics]] and battery technology have become sufficiently advanced to make wearable walking assistance devices viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencerecorder.com/news/nasas-strange-robotic-suit-could-pave-way-to-mars-make-astronauts-safe/|title=NASA’s strange robotic suit could pave way to Mars, make astronauts safe|publisher=Science Recorder|date=11 December 2012|accessdate=12 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213150942/http://www.sciencerecorder.com/news/nasas-strange-robotic-suit-could-pave-way-to-mars-make-astronauts-safe/#|archive-date=13 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/exoskeleton-robots-top-5.html|title=I am Iron Man: Top 5 Exoskeleton Robots|publisher=[[Discovery News]]|year=2012|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Vanderbilt exoskeleton weighs {{convert|27|lb|kg}} and can support users weighing up to {{convert|200|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Medgadget"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vanderbilt1/&gt; It is strapped to the user's legs, and uses an onboard computer to detect the user's movements, which are then supported and amplified by battery-powered motors in the exoskeleton's hip and knee joints.&lt;ref name=Vanderbilt2/&gt; It also uses [[functional electrical stimulation]] to enervate the muscles of paralyzed patients, improving their strength and [[circulatory system|circulation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/vanderbilt-exoskeleton/24815/|title=Vanderbilt University steps into the exoskeleton market|work=Gizmag|date=31 October 2012|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be quickly disassembled for removal.&lt;ref name=CoExist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680940/this-light-affordable-exoskeleton-could-help-the-paralyzed-walk-again#1|title=This Light, Affordable Exoskeleton Could Help The Paralyzed Walk Again|publisher=Fast CoExist|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used interchangeably with a [[wheelchair]], and can be donned without assistance, allowing disabled individuals significantly greater independence.&lt;ref name=Vanderbilt2/&gt; It is compact enough for a person to sit in a normal chair without needing to remove the exoskeleton.&lt;ref name=CoExist/&gt;

==Development==
Vanderbilt University began testing its exoskeleton with paraplegics and medical experts at a rehabilitation center in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in 2010.&lt;ref name=CoExist/&gt; In October 2012, Parker Hannifin signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Vanderbilt University for the right to develop and manufacture a commercial version of the exoskeleton, which it plans to release under the name Indego.&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Indego/&gt; Whereas current commercial exoskeletons can cost as much as $140,000, Parker Hannifin hopes to exploit its manufacturing capabilities and the Vanderbilt model's lightweight design to ensure that the Indego is significantly cheaper.&lt;ref name=Vanderbilt2/&gt; In March 2014, Parker Hannifin entered into clinical trial agreements for the exoskeleton with several major medical rehabilitation centres.&lt;ref name=CrainsC/&gt; In December 2014, Parker Hannifin invested in Freedom Innovations, a California-based prosthetic technology company with which it had a pre-existing partnership, to further the development of Indego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20141204/FREE/141209891/parker-hannifin-strengthens-indego-exoskeleton-development-efforts|title=Parker Hannifin strengthens Indego exoskeleton development efforts with investment in California company|publisher=Crain's Cleveland|date=4 December 2014|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following regulatory approval, Parker Hannifin plans to release Indego in Europe in 2015 and in the United States in 2016.&lt;ref name=CrainsC/&gt;

The '''Working-Class Studies Association (WCSA)''' is a non-profit association that helps develop and support research and pedagogy on the topic of working-class life and cultures. Members are located in countries across the globe, and they include poets, scholars, activists, teachers, students, journalists, artists, small press publishers, and others interested in building the field of working-class studies. The association holds an annual conference and other events, promotes the field through a variety of awards, and publishes ''The Journal of Working-Class Studies''.

==History==
The origins of the Working-Class Studies Association can be traced to the Center for Working-Class Studies at [[Youngstown State University]] in Ohio and the Center for Study of Working Class Life at the [[Stony Brook University|State University of New York at Stony Brook]]. A complementary series of biennial conferences sponsored by these centers fostered a community of scholars, activists, artists, publishers, and journalists invested in the study of and advocacy for working-class life, culture and interests.

The Youngstown Center for Working-Class Studies (CWCS) was the first multi-disciplinary academic center in the US devoted to the study of working-class culture broadly defined. What distinguished the center was an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] approach to the study of [[working class|working-class]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Victor. “The Origins of Working-Class Studies: An Interview with Sherry Linkon and John Russo.” ''The Minnesota Review: A Journal of Committed Writing,'' nos. 63-64, 2005, pp 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt; The center was launched in 1996 after a group of Youngstown faculty organized two interdisciplinary conferences in the early 1990s, one on the 1930s and the next on working-class studies, and received a grant from the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] to explore the category of class as part of a broader project promoting diversity on college campuses. Under the leadership of co-founders Sherry Linkon and John Russo, the center supported a range of activities promoting awareness of and respect for working-class life and culture, including an educational program in collaboration with Local 1375 of the [[United Steelworkers]] that brought college classes to the union hall.&lt;ref&gt;Sharlet, Jeff. “Seeking Solidarity in the Culture of the Working Class.” ''Chronicle of Higher Education,'' vol. 45, no. 46, July 23, 1999, pp 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; This work, in addition to continuing biennial conferences on working-class studies, was further supported by two grants from the [[Ford Foundation]] starting in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwcs.ysu.edu/about/ “History of the CWCS.”] ''Center for Working-Class Studies.'' Youngstown State University. Accessed 5 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Study of Working Class Life was established in 1999 at SUNY Stony Brook under the leadership of [[economist]] Michael Zweig. Like the Youngstown center, The Center for Study of Working Class Life took an interdisciplinary approach to investigating the meaning of class in contemporary society, although with a stronger emphasis on “tools of the social sciences.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/workingclass/overview.html “Overview”] ''Center for Study of Working Class Life.'' Stony Brook University.  Accessed 5 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in 2002, their How Class Works conference became the biennial complement to the Youngstown center’s working-class studies conference. The Youngstown conference met every other odd year, and How Class Works met every other even year, multiplying opportunities for cross-disciplinary interaction and collaboration.

The Working-Class Studies Association began to develop in early 2003 in the course of planning that year’s Youngstown conference.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcstudiesassociation.wordpress.com/about/history/ “History”] ''WCSA: The Working-Class Studies Association.'' Accessed 5 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004, Linkon and John Russo met with 15 participants to develop a [[mission statement]], map out the structure of the organization, and work through organizing issues.&lt;ref&gt;Linkon, Sherry and John Russo. “The Directors’ Report” ''Working-Class Notes,'' vol. 7 no. 2, Spring 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The group included academics and graduate students from multiple fields as well as independent scholars and labor educators.
 
The organization held a founding meeting at Stony Brook in June 2004, setting the stage for its first official business meeting at Youngstown in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Russo, John and Sherry Linkon. “The Directors’ Report. ''Working-Class Notes,'' vol. 8 no. 1, Fall 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution and a slate of candidates for the steering committee were presented at this meeting. Membership received ballots in June and subsequently approved the constitution and first steering committee of the WCSA. The initial slate of officers included Sherry Linkon (President), [[Peter Rachleff]] (President-Elect), Jamie Daniel (Secretary) and Michael Zweig (Treasurer).  At-large members of the first steering committee were Tim Strangleman, Michele Fazio, Mary Romero, and [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;“Working-Class Studies Association Moves Ahead.” ''Working-Class Notes,'' vol. 9 no. 1, Fall 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The WCSA took responsibility for organizing odd-year conferences beginning in 2007, working with host committees at welcoming universities and colleges: [[Macalaster College]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], [[Georgetown University]], and [[Indiana University Bloomington]]. Beginning with the 2018 conference, the WCSA assumed responsibility for even-year conferences as well, beginning with SUNY Stony Brook.

==Publications==
The WCSA publishes ''The Journal of Working-Class Studies,'' an online, [[open access]] [[peer review]]ed journal (ISSN 2475-4765). New issues come out twice yearly, in December and June. The inaugural issue was December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://workingclassstudiesjournal.com/ The Journal of Working-Class Studies].&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is co-edited by Sarah Attfield and Liz Giuffre; Sara Appel is Associate Editor.

From 2006-2017, the association published a semi-annual newsletter, ''Working-Class Notes.'' It provided information about the organization, reports from officers, news and notes about members’ activities, and book reviews. This newsletter was a continuation of a newsletter by the same name published by the Center for Working-Class Studies at Youngstown State University (YSU) from 1998-2006.&lt;ref&gt;Linkon, Sherry and John Russo. “Directors’ Report.” ''Working-Class Notes,'' vol. 9, no.2, Spring 2006, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the fall of 2017 issue, ''Working-Class Notes'' ceased publication as its own entity. Most of the elements of the newsletter—a section called “Book Notes,” member news, the President’s letter, officer reports, and reports from affiliated centers—became available on the WCSA website. Lengthier book reviews, which had been a highlight of ''Working-Class Notes,'' moved to ''The Journal of Working-Class Studies.''&lt;ref&gt;Launius, Christie. “From Christie Launius, Editor of Working-Class Notes.” ''Working-Class Notes,'' Spring 2017, n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Working-Class Notes'' was initially produced by the Center for Working-Class Studies at YSU. It became a WCSA publication in 2006. It was edited by Karen Lynn Ford 2004-2005, Sherry Linkon from 2005-2010, and by Christie Launius from 2010-2017.

The Book Notes section has been edited by Jack Metzgar from 2007 to the present. In 2016, Cherie Rankin began editing the fiction and poetry notices while Metzgar continues editing nonfiction.

==Conferences==
The WCSA grew out of biennial conferences organized by the Center for Working-Class Studies at Youngstown State University starting in 1995 and, beginning in 2002, How Class Works, a biennial conference sponsored by The Center for Study of Working-Class Life at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Since its inception in 2004 the WCSA has sponsored and co-sponsored conferences biennially, and starting in 2018, annually. From 2006-2016 the association met biennially at How Class Works conferences in even numbered years.

In 2007 the WCSA started sponsoring odd-year biennial conferences by presenting Working-Class Culture and Counter Culture at Macalester College. In 2009, the University of Pittsburgh hosted the WCSA’s Class Matters conference. In 2011, the Chicago Working-Class Studies affiliate of the WCSA presented Working Class Organization and Power at the University of Illinois-Chicago.

Fighting Forward: A Labor and Working-Class Summit was held at [[Madison Area Technical College|Madison College’s]] downtown campus in 2013. This conference was co-sponsored with the Labor and Working-Class Studies Project, a collaborative campus-labor-community initiative based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 2015, WCSA co-sponsored Fighting Inequality with the [[Labor and Working-Class History Association]] at Georgetown University. The 2017 conference was hosted by Indiana University Bloomington.

After 2017, the WCSA began sponsoring conferences annually, beginning with Class at the Border: Migration, Confinement, and (Im)mobility, hosted by The Center for the Study of Inequalities, Social Justice and Policy at Stony Brook. Conference programs from 2001 to the present are archived on the WCSA website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcstudiesassociation.wordpress.com/conference-programs/ “Conference Programs.”] ''WCSA: The Working-Class Studies Association.'' Accessed 7 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The awards issued by the WCSA are the [[Tillie Olsen]] Award for Creative Writing, which honors published books of poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, and other genres; the [[C.L.R. James]] Award for Published Books for Academic or General Audiences; the Russo &amp; Linkon Award for Published Article or Essay for Academic or General Audiences; the [[Studs Terkel]] Award for Media and Journalism; and the [[Constance Coiner]] Award for Best Dissertation. Awards are announced each year at the annual conference banquet, and a panels are generally organized around the honored works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcstudiesassociation.wordpress.com/awards/ “Awards.”] ''WCSA: The Working-Class Studies Association.'' Accessed 7 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Anyone may become a member of the WCSA. The administration of the WCSA is conducted by the Steering Committee, which is elected by the members. Elections are conducted by the Election Committee. The Steering Committee consists of the president, the president-elect, the immediate past-president, the secretary, and the treasurer in addition to four at-large members and the chair of the Working-Class Academics Section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcstudiesassociation.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/wcsa-constitution.pdf “WCSA Constitution.”] ''WCSA: The Working-Class Studies Association.'' Accessed 7 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current president is Terry Easton ([[University of North Georgia]]). Past president is Michele Fazio ([[University of North Carolina at Pembroke]]) and president elect is Cherie Rankin ([[Heartland Community College]]).

==Archives==
Michael Zweig, professor [[emeritus]] and former director of the Center for Study of Working Class Life at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, has arranged for archival materials documenting the founding of the WCSA to be housed at the [[Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives]] at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcstudiesassociation.wordpress.com/wcsa-archives/ “WCSA Archives.”] ''WCSA: The Working-Class Studies Association.'' Accessed 7 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archives related to the WCSA include those for the Center for Working-Class Studies, housed at the Maag Library, Youngstown State University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwcs.ysu.edu/ ''Center for Working-Class Studies.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Documents from the founding and development of the Center for Study of Working Class Life can be found in the university archive of the State University of New York at Stony Brook.&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Michael, Message to the author. 5 October 2017.
