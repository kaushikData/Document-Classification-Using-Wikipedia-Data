}}
'''Alicia Koplowitz y Romero de Juseu''' (born 12 September 1954) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[business magnate]] and one-time noblewoman. When her father died, she and her sister inherited Construcciones y Contratas, S.A. (CYCSA), a company founded by her father. She then sold her part of the company to her sister and created one of the largest family offices in Europe called Omega Capital. She ranks as Spain's richest woman in ''[[Forbes]] 2013 World's Richest People'' list (#589 in the world).

==Early life and education==
Alicia was born in [[Madrid]] (Spain) in 1954, the second and youngest daughter (after [[Esther Koplowitz, Marquise of Cubas|Esther]], born in 1953) of [[Ernesto Koplowitz]] Sternberg, a [[Jewish]] businessman from [[Upper Silesia]] ([[Germany]]) who settled down in Spain to escape the increasing [[Germany|German]] [[Nazi]] persecution in the early-1930s,&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas&gt;[http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-24-08-2007/abc/Gente/las-koplowitz-las-mas-ricas-de-espa%C3%B1a_164500293074.html ABC (Spain): "Las Koplowitz Las más ricas de España" by ISABEL GUTIÉRREZ (''in Spanish'')] August 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Esther Romero de Juseu y Armenteros, a Spanish [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]].&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; (Alicia and Esther inherited their titles from their mother. Alicia is ''Marquesa de Bellavista'' and ''Marquesa del Real Socorro'' while Esther was ''Marquesa de Casa Peñalver'', a title now inherited by one of her daughters.) Her parents married in 1950 in a Catholic ceremony.&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/behind-some-great-men-women-who-do-it-better-two-ladies-of-spain-are-flourishing-at-the-top-of-a-construction-empire-after-wresting-it-from-their-wayward-husbands-1534177.html Independent: "Behind some great men, women who do it better: Two ladies of Spain are flourishing at the top of a construction empire after wresting it from their wayward husbands" by JUSTIN WEBSTER] July 19, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Using his German language skills, her father first worked for the German electronics company [[AEG]]&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt; and then in 1952, borrowing funds from a German friend,&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt; purchased the construction company ''Construcciones y Reparaciones S.A.'' which he renamed ''Construcciones y Contratas S.A. (CYCSA).''&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; He slowly built the company, carefully cultivating relationships during the precarious [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] era, and when Spain experienced a construction boom in the early 1960s, the company flourished.&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt;

Alicia attended the ''Lycée Français'' and University Complutense of Madrid. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Career==
In 1962, her father died in a horse-riding accident&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; and her mother enlisted [[Ramón Areces]], a close friend of her father and the president of [[El Corte Inglés S.A.]], the largest department store chain in Europe, to run CYCSA for her and her daughters' benefit.&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt;&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt; In 1968, Alicia's mother died of cancer.&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt;

In 1969, Alicia's sister Esther married [[Alberto Alcocer]] and six months later, Alicia married Alberto Alcocer's cousin [[Alberto Cortina]], the son of [[Pedro Cortina Mauri]], foreign minister during the Franco period and founder of the beer brand San Miguel.&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; The sisters gave up their board seats to their husbands and the ''"Albertos"'', as they were known, made the firm grow spectacularly from 1973 onwards and diversified acquiring real estate, Banco Zaragozano,&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; and 47 percent of Catalonia construction firm ''Fomento de Obras y Construcciones SA (FOCSA).''&lt;ref name=IndependentFlourishing /&gt;

In 1990, Alicia divorced Alberto Cortina&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; after he was [[paparazzi|photographed]] by [[paparazzi]] in 1989 with another woman (Marta Chávarri, then wife of Fernando Falcó, ''marqués de Cubas,'' who Esther would later marry in 2003).&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt; At the same time, Esther also found that her husband was having an affair and divorced six months later. In 1990, the sisters returned to the board of CYCSA, filling the seats vacated by their husbands. Their husbands received ownership of the Banco Zaragozano as part of the divorce settlement.&lt;ref name=ABCMasRicas /&gt;

In 1992, CYCSA merged with '''Fomento de Obras y Construcciones, S.A.'' (FOCSA) forming the largest construction company in Spain. The company was renamed ''[[Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas|Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas S.A.]] (FCC).'' In 1998, Alicia sold her 28.26% stake in FCC to her sister Esther for 871 million euro.&lt;ref name="solidaridad.net"&gt;[http://www.solidaridad.net/articulo1255_enesp.htm Alicia Koplowitz Es La Mujer Más Rica De España : Solidaridad.Net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; When Alicia left FCC in 1998, FCC was the largest construction and services company in Spain with nearly the sales of the next largest. In 2012, FCC had dropped to fifth largest in Spain while its competitor [[Grupo ACS]] (with the sisters' ex-husbands Alberto Cortina &amp; Alberto Alcocer among its largest shareholders) is now the largest construction and services company in the world.

Since then, Alicia has diversified her investments, mainly through Private Equity, [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue chip companies]] in the [[stock exchange]], [[oil]] and [[real estate]] (such as the Ritz in Madrid, the Park Hyatt in Milan and commercial and office buildings all over the US), advised by [[Oscar Fanjul]] (a former ex-chairman of [[Repsol]]). She has an estimated fortune of 3,000 million euro.&lt;ref name="solidaridad.net"/&gt;

In 1998, Alicia created Omega Capital,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} a venture capital firm specializing in growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=519927 BusinessWeek: "Company Overview of Omega Capital, S.L."] retrieved August 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Omega Capital is an investment company 100% owned by Alicia Koplowitz.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The first investment in funds of hedge funds was made in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundspeople.com/noticias/omega-gestion-la-gestora-espanola-que-mas-apuesta-por-la-inversion-libre-39318 Omega Gestión, la gestora española que más apuesta por la inversión libre]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy and awards==
She has created two foundations: ''Fundación Vida y Esperanza'' (in 1994), that helps children, adolescents and young adults with social, family and financial problems with housing, education and work. The foundation now has approximately 100 people receiving full-time aid in Spain. Through a different branch of Vida y Esperanza she also gives housing and support to the elderly, helps people with special needs and works with other foundations.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Through her charitable foundation ''Fundación Alicia Koplowitz'' she sends Spanish fellows to research in child psychiatry in England and the U.S. at places like King's College, Columbia University's Medical Center or Stanford University. These fellowships cover the full research, housing and salary for 2 to 4 years and then help the fellow seek employment at a top institution when they return to Spain. The Foundation also organizes every year the largest convention for psychiatry in Spain where top scientist from all over the world come during one week to give lectures and make round tables and debates. In 2009 she was named an honorary member of the Spanish Society of Psychiatrists for her efforts to promote the study and development of child and adolescent psychiatry. Thanks to her efforts, the Spanish State recognized child and adolescent psychiatry as different specialization within general psychiatry in Spain.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Alicia Koplowitz also promoted, built and donated to the State the largest hospital in Europe specialized in multiple sclerosis in 2004 (Alicia Koplowitz Multiple Sclerosis Hospital).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Among her distinctions and awards, she was awarded the ''Gran Cruz de la Orden del Mérito Civil'' (May 2003), Chevalier de La Légion d'honneur of France (Knight of the Legion of Honour, of France), the prize for the recognition of her career from the State of Madrid in 2007 (Premio Persona Singular de la Comunidad de Madrid), the Gold Medal from the Spanish State in 2009 and the Gold Medal from the Red Cross in 2013.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Alicia is known to have a very low-key way of life and an extremely discreet social life. It is rare to see her at any social event besides the ones organized by her foundation and she always uses commercial airlines when traveling.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Between 2004 - 2006 Koplowitz was in a relationship with a Spanish aristocrat [[Carlos Fitz-James Stuart, 19th Duke of Alba|Carlos Fitz-James Stuart]], 19th Duke of Alba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2006/10/15/agenda/1160863202_850215.html|title=Reportaje {{!}} Alicia Koplowitz y el duque de Huéscar, una relación de dos años|last=País|first=Ediciones El|date=2006-10-15|work=El País|access-date=2018-04-29|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2005/483/1105830013.html|title=- EL MUNDO {{!}} Suplemento Crónica 483 - El cuento de Alicia y el duque|website=www.elmundo.es|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-10-08-2005/abc/Gente/el-duque-de-huescar-y-alicia-koplowitz-no-se-casan_2189859494.html|title=El duque de Huéscar y Alicia Koplowitz no se casan {{!}} Gente {{!}} Gente - Abc.es|last=ABC|website=ABC|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.revistavanityfair.es/la-revista/articulos/alicia-esther-koplowitz-vanity-fair-al-fin-juntas/21893|title=Alicia y Esther Koplowitz, al fin juntas: amor, finanzas y conflictos familiares|date=2016-02-19|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2018-04-29|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alicia was brought up [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] by her mother and was for some years associated with the [[Legion of Christ]].&lt;ref name=Clarin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2004/437/1078148131.html El Mundo: "La maravillosa fortuna de Alicia - La pequeña de las hermanas Koplowitz se ha convertido en la mujer más rica de España.

Con cerca de 3.000 millones de euros, uno de sus caprichos es Goya" by JUAN LUIS GALIACHO] 29 de febrero de 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Her Cuban-born mother, Esther Romero de Juseu y Armenteros (died 1968), started a legal battle to obtain the Marquisate of El Real Socorro, which ended in 1971 with Koplowitz gaining the nobiliary title; her sister Esther obtained in court in 1988 the County of Peñalver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galán|first1=Lola|title=Ser o no ser noble, he ahí la obsesión|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/11/23/gente/1353692623_441411.html|accessdate=28 April 2017|publisher=El País|date=24 November 2012|location=Madrid|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 she lost in court the right to be called the Marquise of Bellavista after being sued by her Cuban-American distant cousin [[María Elena de Cárdenas y González]], aged 97. The same month de Cárdenas also won in the Spanish courts the Marquisate of Almendares from another Cuban man, meanwhile in the previous month (February 2017), she gained the Marquisate of Campo Florido from Koplowitz's niece, Alicia Alcocer-Koplowitz.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/sur-de-la-florida/article138467653.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Madrid|first=José|title=Alicia Koplowitz pierde su marquesado a manos de una nonagenaria cubana|url=http://www.vanitatis.elconfidencial.com/noticias/2017-03-16/alicia-koplowitz-pierde-marquesado-bellavista-favor-maria-elena-cardenas_1349023/|accessdate=28 April 2017|agency=El Confidencial|publisher=Vanitatis|date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive''' 2011/61/EU (or "AIFMD" for short) is an [[EU law]] on the [[financial regulation]] of [[hedge fund]]s, [[private equity]], real estate funds, and other "Alternative Investment Fund Managers" (AIFMs) in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="FCA14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/international-markets/aifmd |title=Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) |date=12 November 2014 |work=Financial Conduct Authority |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waller14&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesslife.co/Features.aspx?id=the-long-and-winding-road |title=The long and winding road |author=Dave Waller |work=''BusinessLife.co'' |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Directive requires all covered AIFMs to obtain authorisation, and make various disclosures as a condition of operation. It followed the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]].

==Background==
The AIFMD was prompted as part of a wider regulatory effort undertaken by [[G-20 major economies|G20 nations]] following the [[Global financial crisis in September 2008|global market downturn of 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The EU as a Global Player |author=Astrid B.

On the need for the directive, an explanatory document from the European Commission stated that AIFMs had become "very significant actors in the European financial system, managing a large quantity of assets on behalf of pension funds and other investors; accounting for a significant proportion of trading activity in financial markets; and constituting an important source of counterparty risk for other market participants" and that they had "contributed to the build-up of leverage in the financial system, the consequences of which for the stability of financial markets became apparent when leverage in the hedge fund sector was rapidly unwound during the crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=16 September 2015|url= http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-10-572_en.htm?locale=en|title= Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers ('AIFMD'): Frequently Asked Questions|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the directive was approved by the [[European Parliament]], [[José Manuel Barroso]], then [[President of the European Commission]], said "The adoption of the directive means that hedge funds and private equity will no longer operate in a regulatory void outside the scope of supervisors. The new regime brings transparency and security to the way these funds are managed and operate, which adds to the overall stability of our financial system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=16 September 2015|url= http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-10-573_en.htm?locale=en|title= European Commission statement at the occasion of the European Parliament vote on the directive on hedge funds and private equity|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
===Ch I, General provisions===

{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
The scope of the application of the directive is defined. The directives apply to EU AIFMs which manage one or more AIFs irrespective of whether such AIFs are EU AIFs or non-EU AIFs; non-EU AIFMs which manage one or more EU AIFs; and non-EU AIFMs which market one or more AIFs in the Union irrespective of whether such AIFs are EU AIFs or non-EU AIFs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L:2011:174:FULL&amp;from=EN|title=Official Journal L 174/2011|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific entities that are exempt from the directives are also listed.

===Ch II, Authorisation===
An AIFM must be authorised with the AIFM's home state regulator for AIFMs that have assets under management in AIFs above the thresholds of: (1) 100 million EUR, if the AIF uses leverage; or (2) 500 million EUR, if the AIF does not use leverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFM Directive for US Private Fund Managers |author=Neil Robson |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/print/article/aifm-directive-us-private-fund-managers |work=The National Law Review |date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ch III, Operating conditions for AIFMs===
The AIFMD's reporting regulations require each AIF to be named using a series of codes, including its national identification code, the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) and the Legal Entity Identifier code.&lt;ref name=EC2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESMAconsult13&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |title=Consultation paper: guidelines on reporting obligations under Article 3 and Article 4 of the AIFMD |publisher=European Securities and Market Authority |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/system/files/2013-592_consultation_paper_on_esma_guidelines_on_aifmd_reporting_for_publication.pdf |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIFMs must select only brokers and counterparties that are subject to regulatory supervision, that are financially sound, and that have the necessary organizational structure to provide services to the AIFM or the AIF.&lt;ref name=EC2/&gt; All AIFMs must submit quarterly, semi-annual, or annual reports to their respective member state regulator with information about the AIFM and its AIFs as well as an annual report with information such as the fund's financial statements, activities, and information about the total amount of remuneration paid by the AIFM to its staff.&lt;ref name=EC2/&gt;

===Chs IV-V, Transparency requirements===
Special requirements apply to AIFMs using leverage. AIFMs are required to disclose the extent of the leverage employed within their funds, and prove that leverage in any fund has been limited to a reasonable amount.&lt;ref name=PDF&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |title=Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive: AIFMs managing leveraged AIFs |pages=3–5 |publisher=Financial Services Commission |url=http://www.fsc.gi/download/AIFMD/AIFMDManagingSpecificTypesOfAIFsAIFMsManagingLeveragedAIFs.pdf |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of AIFMD requirements that apply to AIFMs are different, depending on whether the AIFM is engaged in portfolio or risk management activities within the EU or markets its funds to EU investors. Each fund can only have one AIFM, though the AIFM can delegate certain functions to other entities. EU AIFMs became subject to all of the provisions of the AIFMD once it was implemented at the EU Member State level.&lt;ref name=Yonge13&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFMD's Impact on Non-EU Managers of Non-EU Alternative Investment Funds |author=William Younge |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-338211304.html |work=Mondaq Business Briefing |date=30 July 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorised fund managers located within the EU are permitted to market their EU funds to professional investors in any EU member state under what the AIFMD calls a passport.&lt;ref name=Yonge13/&gt;

The reporting requirements of the AIFMD apply to all AIFMs who manage or market alternative funds within the EU.&lt;ref name=Hedgeweek14&gt;{{cite news |title=SEI introduces AIFMD Annex IV reporting solution |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2014/12/09/214424/sei-introduces-aifmd-annex-iv-reporting-solution |work=HedgeWeek |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill the reporting requirements, AIFMs must file an Annex IV report within 30 days of the end of the applicable reporting period, which is determined by the amount of an AIFM's assets under management. Reporting periods range from quarterly to half-yearly to annually.&lt;ref name=ESMAconsult13/&gt; The Annex IV report is a government regulatory document comprising 41 questions, analysing a fund's investment portfolios, exposures, leverage ratios, liquidity and risk analysis.&lt;ref name=Lipman14&gt;{{cite news |title=This is Why AIFMD Annex IV Reports Demand More Attention |author=Becca Lipman |url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/data-management/this-is-why-aifmd-annex-iv-reports-demand-more-attention/d/d-id/1268695? |work=Wallstreet &amp; Technology |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=COOwebinar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cooconnect.com/webinar-review/how-ready-are-aifms-for-annex-iv-reporting-under-aifmd |title=2014 Q2 Webinar Programme |author=CME Group |date=7 July 2014 |work=COOConnect |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter V, section 2, articles 26–30, additional obligations apply for AIFs acquiring controlling influence in non-listed companies. This is essentially directed at [[private equity]] firms, and partly aims to stop [[asset stripping]]. Article 26(5) defines "control" as holding over 50% of voting rights, including as a ‘club deal’. This was watered down from 30% in the AIFMD draft (formerly in article 26(1)(a)). Article 27(1) states that funds have to notify investee companies and shareholders when they acquire control, and article 28(4) requires them to disclose the acquisition to stakeholder groups including employees or representatives via the investee's board. Article 29 places an obligation on the central Private Equity management company (rather than an investee companies) to give information on operational and financial developments in firm's annual reports. Article 30 lists distribution requirements, which are intended to prevent [[asset stripping]] in the first 24 months from acquiring control).

===Chs VI-VIII, Marketing and the AIFMD passport===
For the purposes of the directive, marketing is defined as any offering or placement (sale) of an AIF at the initiative of the AIFM, or on behalf of the AIFM, to investors domiciled in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFM Directive for US Private Fund Managers |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/aifm-directive-us-private-fund-managers |work=The National Law Review |date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawrence14&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFMD: Time to Back Up on Reverse Solicitation |author=David Lawrence |url=http://www.finalternatives.com/node/26688 |work=FIN Alternatives |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member state laws and rules determine whether a fund is engaged in marketing for purposes of the directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The British Virgin Islands – AIFMD one year on |author=Tim Clipstone |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2014/06/27/205833/british-virgin-islands-%E2%80%93-aifmd-one-year |work=HedgeWeek |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU funds managed by EU managers may be marketed across the EU under the AIFMD passport, provided the manager complies with all of the requirements of the directive.&lt;ref name=Lawrence14/&gt; EU or non-EU funds managed by non-EU managers may currently be marketed within the EU only under national private placement regimes, as non-EU managers cannot obtain the marketing passport.&lt;ref name=Moran15&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFMD offers passport to European markets |author=Michelle Moran |url=http://www.ftadviser.com/2015/03/30/investments/fixed-income/aifmd-offers-passport-to-european-markets-maFHbHp1XZ0R07MAUizxnK/article.html |work=Financial Times Advisor |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, non-EU funds managed by EU managers may only be marketed under the private placement regimes. Funds marketed under national private placement regimes are subject to compliance with certain provisions of the AIFMD related to reporting, regulatory co-operation agreements, and the jurisdiction of the fund and the manager not being listed as a "non-cooperative country and territory" by the [[Financial Action Task Force]] (FATF).&lt;ref name=EurActiv15&gt;{{cite news |title=Why competition is vital to Europe's investors |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/euro-finance/why-competition-vital-europes-investors-311308 |work=''EurActiv.com'' |date=15 January 2015 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-EU AIFMD Passports==

In 2015, an analyst for EurActiv.com, a European news and policy website, expressed concern that the directive puts non-EU funds at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name=EurActiv15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffith14&gt;{{cite news |title=The AIFMD Deadline Tomorrow: Is The Industry Ready? |author=Saul Griffith |url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/07/aifmd-hedge-funds/ |work=ValueWalk |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the European Securities and Markets Authority initiated a consultation to discuss issuing new rules to allow EU AIFMs to market their non-EU AIFs under the AIFMD passport, and likewise for non-EU managers to market their funds under the AIFMD passport.&lt;ref name=EurActiv15/&gt;&lt;ref name=COO&gt;{{cite news |title=Uncertainty over extent to which AIFMD passport will be afforded to non-EU managers |url=http://cooconnect.com/news/uncertainty-over-extent-to-which-aifmd-passport-will-be-afforded-to-non-eu-managers |work=COO Connect |date=16 February 2015 |accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESMAevidence&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/consultation/Call-evidence-AIFMD-passport-and-third-country-AIFMs |title=Call for evidence on AIFMD passport and third country AIFMs |publisher=ESMA |accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016 AIFM concluded that there were no fundamental obstacles to issuing AIFMD passports to Canada, [[Guernsey]], Japan, [[Jersey]] and [[Switzerland]], seven other non-EU countries are also under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-advises-extension-funds-passport-12-non-eu-countries |title=EXTENSION OF FUNDS PASSPORT TO 12 NON-EU COUNTRIES |publisher=ESMA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23320">{{Anti-consumerism}}

'''Anti-consumerism''' is a [[sociopolitical]] [[ideology]] that is opposed to [[consumerism]], the continual buying and consuming of material possessions.  Anti-consumerism is concerned with the private actions of business corporations in pursuit of financial and economic goals at the expense of the public welfare, especially in matters of [[environmental protection]], [[social stratification]], and [[ethics]] in the governing of a society. In politics, anti-consumerism overlaps with [[environmental activism]], [[anti-globalization]], and [[animal-rights]] activism; moreover, a conceptual variation of anti-consumerism is ''[[post-consumerism]]'', living in a material way that transcends consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postconsumers.com |title=Postconsumers |publisher=Postconsumers |date=2018-06-13 |accessdate=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-consumerism arose in response to the problems caused by the long-term mistreatment of human consumers and of the animals consumed, and from the incorporation of [[consumer education]] to school [[curriculum|curricula]]; examples of anti-consumerism are the book ''[[No Logo]]'' (2000) by [[Naomi Klein]], and documentary films such as ''[[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' (2003), by [[Mark Achbar]] and [[Jennifer Abbott]], and ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus: Terrorized into Being Consumers]]'' (2003), by [[Erik Gandini]]; each made [[anti-corporate activism]] popular as an ideologically accessible form of civil and political action.

The criticism of [[economic materialism]] as a dehumanizing behaviour that is destructive of the Earth, as [[biosphere|human habitat]], comes from [[religion]] and [[social activism]]. The religious criticism asserts that materialist consumerism interferes with the connection between the individual and God, and so is an inherently [[immoral]] style of life; thus the German historian [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936) said that "Life in America is exclusively economic in structure, and lacks depth."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Stearns, Peter. ''Consumerism in World History''. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; From the Roman Catholic perspective, [[Thomas Aquinas]] said that "Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things"; in that vein, [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] said that spiritual inspiration guided them towards [[simple living]].

From the secular perspective, social activism indicates that from consumerist materialism derive [[crime]] (which originates from the [[poverty]] of [[economic inequality]]), industrial [[pollution]] and the consequent [[environmental degradation]], and [[war]] as a business. About the societal discontent born of [[malaise]] and [[hedonism]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] said that the philosophy of materialism offers no ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]'' for human existence;&lt;ref&gt;Web log. 17 July 2008. http://babs22.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/australia-pope-attacks-consumerism/&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the writer [[Georges Duhamel]] said that "American materialism [is] a beacon of mediocrity that threatened to eclipse French civilization".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Background==
Anti-consumerism originated from criticism of consumption, starting with [[Thorstein Veblen]], who, in the book ''[[Theory of the Leisure Class|The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions]]'' (1899), indicated that [[consumerism]] dates from the [[cradle of civilization]]. The term ''consumerism'' also denotes economic policies associated with [[Keynesian economics]], and the belief that the free choice of consumers should dictate the economic structure of a society (cf. [[producerism]]).

==Politics and society==
[[File:Anticonsumismo.JPG|thumb|250px|An anti-consumerist [[stencil graffiti]] saying "Consuming consumes you"]]
Many [[anti-corporate activist]]s believe the rise of large-business corporations poses a threat to the legitimate authority of [[nation states]] and the public sphere.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} They feel corporations are invading people's [[privacy]], manipulating politics and governments, and creating false needs in consumers.  They state evidence such as invasive advertising [[adware]], [[spam (electronic)|spam]], [[telemarketing]], child-targeted advertising, aggressive [[guerrilla marketing]], massive corporate campaign contributions in political elections, interference in the policies of sovereign nation states ([[Ken Saro-Wiwa]]), and news stories about [[corporate corruption]] ([[Enron]], for example).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Anti-consumerism protesters point out that the main responsibility of a corporation is to answer only to [[shareholders]], giving [[human rights]] and other issues almost no consideration.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The management does have a primary responsibility to their shareholders, since any [[philanthropic]] activities that do not directly serve the business could be deemed to be a [[Position of trust|breach of trust]].  This sort of financial responsibility means that multi-national corporations will pursue strategies to intensify labor and reduce costs. For example, they will attempt to find low wage economies with laws which are conveniently lenient on human rights, the [[natural environment]], [[trade union]] organization and so on (see, for example, [[Nike, Inc.#Human rights concerns|Nike]]).

An important contribution to the critique of consumerism has been made by French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]], arguing modern capitalism is governed by consumption rather than production, and the advertising techniques used to create [[consumer behaviour]] amount to the destruction of psychic and collective [[individuation]].  The diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products, he argues, results in an addictive cycle of consumption, leading to hyper consumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery.

In art, [[Banksy]], influential British graffiti master, painter, activist, filmmaker and all-purpose provocateur&lt;ref name="Kakutani"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/books/banksy-the-man-behind-the-wall-by-will-ellsworth-jones.html|title=‘Banksy: The Man Behind the Wall,’ by Will Ellsworth-Jones|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=2013-02-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; has made statements in public works about the consumerist society. Working undercover, the secretive street artist challenges social ideas and goads viewers into rethinking their surroundings, to acknowledge the absurdities of closely held preconceptions.&lt;ref name="Kakutani"/&gt; Quote from Banksy: “You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.” After 2003, Banksy wrote the ''New Yorker'' by e-mail: “I give away thousands of paintings for free. I don’t think it’s possible to make art about world poverty and trouser all the cash.” Banksy believes that there is a consumerist shift in art, and for the first time, the bourgeois world of art belongs to the people. On his [http://www.banksy.co.uk/menu.asp website], he provides high-resolution images of his work for free downloading.

===Conspicuous consumption===

In many critical contexts,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} the term describes the tendency of people to identify strongly with products or services they consume, especially with commercial [[brand]] names and obvious [[status symbol|status-enhancing]] appeal, such as a brand of expensive automobiles or [[jewelry]]. It is a pejorative term which most people deny, having some more specific excuse or [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] for consumption other than the idea that they are "compelled to consume". A culture that has a high amount of consumerism is referred to as a [[consumer culture]].

To those who embrace the idea of consumerism, these products are not seen as valuable in themselves, but rather as social signals that allow them to identify like-minded people through consumption and display of similar products. Few would yet go so far, though, as to admit that their relationships with a product or brand name could be substitutes for healthy human relationships that sometimes lack in a dysfunctional modern [[society]].

The older term ''conspicuous consumption'' described the [[United States]] in the 1960s, but was soon linked to larger debates about [[media influence]], [[culture jamming]], and its corollary [[productivism]]. 
[[File:BarsStencil.jpg|thumb|Anti-consumerist [[stencil]] art]]
The term and concept of ''conspicuous consumption'' originated at the turn of the 20th century in the writing of economist [[Thorstein Veblen]]. The term describes an apparently irrational and confounding form of economic behaviour. Veblen's scathing proposal that this unnecessary consumption is a form of status display is made in darkly humorous observations like the following:
{{quote |It is true of dress in even a higher degree than of most other items of consumption, that people will undergo a very considerable degree of privation in the comforts or the necessaries of life in order to afford what is considered a decent amount of wasteful consumption; so that it is by no means an uncommon occurrence, in an inclement climate, for people to go ill clad in order to appear well dressed.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]], 1899&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, economist [[Victor Lebow]] stated (as quoted by [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]], 2009):
{{quote |Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego satisfaction in consumption. We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.}}

According to archaeologists, evidence of conspicuous consumption up to several millennia ago has been found, suggesting that such behavior is inherent to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Consumerism and advertising===
Anti-consumerists believe [[advertising]] plays a huge role in human life by informing values and assumptions of the cultural system, deeming what is acceptable and determining social standards.&lt;ref name="World. Dir 1997"&gt;[ Advertising and the End of the World. Dir. Sut Jhally. Perf. [[Sut Jhally]]. DVD. Media Education Foundation, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;  They declare that ads create a hyper-real world where commodities appear as the key to securing happiness.  Anti-consumerists cite studies that find that individuals believe their quality of life improves in relation to social values that lie outside the capability of the market place.  Therefore, advertising attempts to equate the social with the material by utilizing images and slogans to link commodities with the real sources of human happiness, such as meaningful relationships.  Ads are then a detriment to society because they tell consumers that accumulating more and more possessions will bring them closer to self-actualization, or the concept of a complete and secure being.  "The underlying message is that owning these products will enhance our image and ensure our popularity with others".&lt;ref&gt;[Tim Kasser, "The High Price of Materialism", 2002, p.9, Achorn Graphic Services]&lt;/ref&gt; And while advertising promises that a product will make the consumer happy, advertising simultaneously depends upon the consumer never being ''truly'' happy, as then the consumer would no longer feel the need to consume needless products.

Anti-consumerists claim that in a consumerist society, advertisement images disempower and objectify the consumer.&lt;ref name="Rumbo"&gt;Joseph D. Rumbo, "Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters", Psychology and Marketing, Vol.19(2), February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  By stressing individual power, choice and desire, advertising falsely implies the control lies with the consumer.  Because anti-consumerists believe commodities only supply short-term gratification, they detract from a sustainably happy society.  Further, advertisers have resorted to new techniques of capturing attention, such as the increased speed of ads and [[product placement]]s.&lt;ref name="World. Dir 1997"/&gt;  In this way, commercials infiltrate the consumerist society and become an inextricable part of culture.  Anti-consumerists condemn advertising because it constructs a simulated world that offers fantastical [[escapism]] to consumers, rather than reflecting actual reality.  They further argue that ads depict the interests and lifestyles of the elite as natural; cultivating a deep sense of inadequacy among viewers.&lt;ref name="Rumbo" /&gt;  They denounce use of beautiful models because they glamorize the commodity beyond reach of the average individual.

In an opinion segment of ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine published in August 2009, reporter Andy Coghlan cited [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] of the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Warren Hern]] of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], saying that human beings, despite considering themselves civilized thinkers, are "subconsciously still driven by an impulse for survival, domination and expansion... an impulse which now finds expression in the idea that inexorable economic growth is the answer to everything, and, given time, will redress all the world's existing inequalities." According to figures presented by Rees at the annual meeting of the [[Ecological Society of America]], human society is in a "global overshoot", consuming 30% more material than is sustainable from the world's resources. Rees went on to state that at present, 85 countries are exceeding their domestic "bio-capacities", and compensate for their lack of local material by depleting the stocks of other countries.

===Alternatives to mainstream economic concepts===
{{confusing|section|date=August 2013}}
Throughout the ages, various movements have tried to model alternatives to consumerism while remaining in the capitalist society. [[Intentional community|Intentional communities]] provide an example of this, as do monastic orders, barter movements and technology-driving sharing or exchange mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/|title=Bruderhof - Fellowship for Intentional Community|work=Fellowship for Intentional Community|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, an intentional community called the Bruderhof has a system of sharing within the community, and no money is used by the members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bruderhof runs a successful manufacturing business that allows it to trade in the capitalistic society, but without the members indulging in consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityplaythings.com/about-us/history|title=communityplaythings.com - Our History|website=www.communityplaythings.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such anti-consumerist, anti-capitalist notions are not without their detractors. New thought and theory has spurred movements to alter world economic climate. Green movements and some other thinkers are opposed to the focus put on economics. The need for terminology has created familiar ideas such as [[carrying-capacity]], and [[ecological footprint]].

[[David Ricardo]], an early economist, had ideas that state the finitude of growth, rather than the opposite; his ideas were similar to those of [[Mark Twain]], when he said "Buy land, they don't make it anymore." To Ricardian logic, land was a limiting factor.

==Austrian economics==

Some{{who|date=December 2017}} adherents to the Austrian economic philosophy advocate against consumerism due to its effect of contributing to "debt slavery." Austrian economic advocates focus on the entrepreneur, promoting a productive lifestyle rather than a materialistic one wherein the individual is defined by things and not himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/consumerism-defense|title=Consumerism: A Defense - Tibor R. Machan|first=|last=kanopiadmin|date=27 October 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many{{who|date=October 2015}} have accused anti-consumerists of opposing [[modernity]] or [[utilitarianism]]. Right-wing critics see anti-consumerism as rooted in socialism. In 1999, the [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] magazine [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'']] attacked anti-consumerism, claiming [[marxism|Marxist]] academics are repackaging themselves as anti-consumerists. [[James B. Twitchell]], a professor at the [[University of Florida]] and popular writer, referred to anti-consumerist arguments as "Marxism Lite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Twitchell |first1=James B. |title=In Praise of Consumerism |date=August 2000 |website=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/27795.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been socialist critics of anti-consumerism who see it as a form of anti-modern "reactionary socialism", and state that anti-consumerism has also been adopted by ultra-conservatives and [[fascism|fascists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Varul |first1=Matthias Zick |title=Towards a consumerist critique of capitalism: A socialist defence of consumer culture |journal=Ephemera: Theory &amp; Politics in Organization |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=293–315 |date=May 2013 |url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/towards-consumerist-critique-capitalism-socialist-defence-consumer-culture |issn=1473-2866 |isbn=9781906948177 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular media==
In [[Fight Club]], the protagonist, finds himself participating in terroristic acts against corporate society and consumer culture.

In [[Mr. Robot]], Elliot Anderson, a young cybersecurity engineer, joins a hacker group known as fsociety, which aims to crash the U.S. economy, eliminating all debt.

In the novel [[American Psycho]] by [[Bret Easton Ellis]], the protagonist Patrick Bateman criticizes the consumerist society of America in the 1980s of which he is a personification. Later on he goes on a killing spree  without any consequences, suggesting that the people around him are so self-absorbed and focused on consuming that they either don't see or don't care about his acts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">'''Bait Acts''' were [[law]]s passed in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] to try to control the sale of bait to French fishermen, and later to Canadian and American fishermen. 

==History==
In the 1800s France claimed exclusive rights to fish along the shores of Newfoundland, and to cure the fish on the shores.  Newfoundland was a British colony, but Britain had other priorities when negotiating fishing rights, and did little to protect the Newfoundland fishery.  

In 1857 Britain signed an agreement allowing the French jurisdiction over an area of the shoreline where the fish were cured, and giving them the right to run off any vessels that were impeding their fishing activities.&lt;ref name="Rose2007"&gt;George A. Rose. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDNe7GOOwfwC&amp;pg=PA279 Cod: The Ecological History of the North Atlantic Fisheries]''. Breakwater Books; 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-55081-225-1}}. p. 279–.&lt;/ref&gt;

To minimize this interference in their own fishery, the Newfoundland Assembly introduced the first Bait Act in 1886, making it illegal to sell bait to French fishermen, but [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] refused to give its required agreement until this act was modified in 1887.&lt;ref name="Senate1892"&gt;Canada.

Heritage Books; October 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-7884-2310-9}}. p. 519–.&lt;/ref&gt; This Act and subsequent variations did not appreciably curtail the [[fishing]] activities of the [[France|French]], who were able to find alternative supplies. &lt;ref name="Korneski2016"&gt;Kurt Korneski.

McGill-Queen's University Press; 2016. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-4780-3}}. p. 102–.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1890s, after Canadian interference led Britain to veto a trade agreement with the United States, Newfoundland tried to use Bait Act provisions to influence and regulate the sale of bait to [[Canadians|Canadian]] fishermen.&lt;ref name="Cadigan2009"&gt;Sean Thomas Cadigan.

The '''United States National Academy of Sciences' Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy''' (STEP) is a board of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]].

The mandate of the Board is to integrate understanding of scientific, technological, and economic elements in the formulation of national policies affecting the economic well-being of the United States. The program’s focus is on the dynamics of the macroeconomic and microeconomic variables, their relationship to the industrial structure of the economy, effect on high-technology manufacturing and service sectors, and influence on U.S. scientific and technological advancement through examination of trade, human resources, fiscal, research and development, intellectual property and other policies. Policymakers responsible for these areas in the executive branch and Congress are the audience for the STEP Board’s work in the form of consensus reports, conferences, and workshops. The current Executive Director is Stephen A. Merrill, Ph.D. and the Board Chair is Paul Joskow, president of the Sloan Foundation.

== History and evolution ==

===Establishment===
The Academies began to address issues of U.S. competitiveness and innovation in the late 1970s and early 1980s through a series of industry studies by the NAE and broad policy studies by the [[Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy]] (COSEPUP).

A leading NAS economist, [[Dale Jorgenson]], and NAE industrialists [[Ralph Landau]] and [[George Hatsopoulos]] were concerned that this work, and national innovation policy more broadly, did not sufficiently reflect the contributions economics could make to understanding of trends and policy prescriptions to improve outcomes. They proposed to the National Research Council (NRC) Governing Board of Directors of the NAS to create a new standing committee as a forum for dialogue among economists, technologists, and industrial managers to those ends. The Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP) was established in 1991, originally as an independent board with funding from the NRC and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. Subsequently, it was combined with COSEPUP and Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable (GUIRR) in the Policy Division, at which time the Academy and Institute presidents were made ex-officio members to make the three units more similar in structure.

===Composition===
In composing the first slate of members, the Academies added a fourth category of expertise and experience – finance and investment – and took care to ensure that among the members were people with high-level public policy experience. Over the past 16 years the membership has included leading industrialists (Rube Mettler, Don Peterson, Bill Spencer), three Nobel Laureates (Mike Spence, Joe Stiglitz, and Jim Heckman) among many leading microeconomists, prominent venture capitalists (Burton McMurtry, Kathy Behrens, and [[David Morgenthaler]]), scientists and engineers from the Academies (George Whitesides and Vint Cerf), former policymakers (James Lynn, Mary Good, and Alan Wolff), and people whose careers have bridged the corporate and nonprofit sectors (Edward Penhoet) or industry and elective politics (Amo Houghton, Jr.). In STEP’s first decade the majority of industrialists represented heavy manufacturing and information technology. In recent years there has been an effort to recruit more senior managers from life science-based industries and services.

===Policy environment and focus===
Not coincidentally, concern about Japanese competition and fear of a progressive decline in the U.S. manufacturing base was peaking at the time STEP was created. Indeed, the perception that Japan enjoyed a broad and enduring competitive advantage from a substantially lower cost of capital was a motivating factor in establishing the Board and became the subject of its first conference and report. In the late 1990s, of course, pessimism gave way to extreme confidence in the economy, lasting until the [[dot-com collapse]]. The contemporary policy environment is again one of concern if not alarm about U.S. economic performance, although vis-à-vis different sources of competition.

In this fluctuating environment, STEP’s focus has not shifted away from the U.S. position in the global economy. Investing for Productivity and Prosperity was followed by a series of projects examining development of international technical standards and testing certification, technology policy as a source of trade friction among the industrialized countries, tax policy affecting the location of foreign direct investment and R&amp;D performance, evaluation of U.S. and foreign government interventions in support of commercial technology development, and the effects of foreign government conditions on aerospace sales and investment. A major focus since the late 1990s has been on the reasons for the improved competitiveness of many U.S. industries and the resurgence in productivity growth, the extent to which these are accurately measured and reflected in the national economic accounts, and how they can be sustained.

Nevertheless, the STEP portfolio has become more diversified, with projects on the economics of [[K-12 education]] reform, impact of technology on jobs and wages, supply of IT workers, quality of innovation-related statistics, functioning of the patent system, impact of intellectual property on research, shifts in the federal research portfolio by field, financing of entrepreneurship, prizes as a tool of innovation policy, and aeronautics R&amp;D at [[NASA]]. This diversification has been a key to STEP’s success and endurance, but the board is mindful that global competition and its effects on Americans’ employment and welfare remain the principal driver of its agenda. When, as now, public and political concern is ascendant, other institutions and others in the Academy are quickly drawn into this policy arena to compete for many of the same sources of financial support. Within the past 3 or 4 years alone nominally similar programs have been launched at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Brookings Institution]], [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] and spun off from the [[Progressive Policy Institute]].

Since nearly all of STEP’s work is [[microeconomic]], other ways to parse STEP’s portfolio are by industrial sector and by microeconomic policy. On the first dimension, STEP has focused intensively on semiconductors, software, computing (and its component technologies), and biotechnology and given considerable attention also to aviation, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, telecommunications, metal fabrication, and finance. At the same time, STEP has done significant although by no means exhaustive work on the following microeconomic policies – tax, trade, standards, K-12 and graduate education, workforce training, intellectual property, economic statistics, and, of course, direct and indirect research and development support.

Areas that have received little attention to date are agriculture, energy and power, and environmental regulation. Although these are the domains of other standing NRC units that, of course, does not preclude STEP from undertaking projects in those areas tailored to its strengths nor does it preclude collaborations. Discussions have in fact occurred with each of those units (BANR, BEES, and BEST) and led to formal collaborative proposals, but unfortunately those proposals have not attracted sponsors.

== Accomplishments ==

===Dialogue===
Encouraging cross-disciplinary, cross-sector dialogue on issues of competitiveness and innovation was a major theme of the NRC discussions leading to the creation of STEP. The Board itself has sustained this dialogue across many changes in membership notably including the departure recently of the last original member, Dale Jorgenson. Meetings are well attended and members frequently remark on the high caliber of discussion and learning across disciplines and sectors.

STEP has extended this form of dialogue to the many ad hoc committees under its oversight. Normally, STEP study committees include 2 or 3 STEP members – a testament to the fact that many (perhaps most) projects are conceived in board discussions and members become committed to helping carry them through to fruition. In addition, an effort is made to ensure that study committee rosters recommended to the Division Chair and the President include a mix of expertise and experience similar to that on the board itself – industrial technologists, economists, financial executives, academic scientists, and former policymakers

STEP has also contributed to dialogue within the NRC. Staff are frequently asked to suggest committee members and other resources for studies in other units. Formal collaborations have involved the Science, Technology, and Law Committee, Committee on National Statistics, Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, Board on Higher Education and the Workforce, Board on Testing and Assessment, National Cancer Policy Board, and Board on Health Care Services (of the National Academies).

===Contributions to research===
STEP has benefited from and exploited the microeconomic field of technology and productivity analysis that is the fairly recent legacy of Griliches, Jorgenson, Solow, Mansfield, and others as well as the work of international trade economists. But the fact is that in many of the specific policy areas of STEP work – intellectual property, standards, program evaluation, etc. – there is a serious deficit of empirical research. Rather than rely on anecdote and judgment, the Board has when possible taken the step – unusual for the Academy – of supporting small-scale original research projects, often surveys. This was done in studies of the patent system, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, Advanced Technology Program (ATP), and biomedical researchers’ experience with intellectual property. In all of these cases, the research results strongly influenced study committees’ findings and recommendations. That, in turn, has encouraged more research. In the case of the patent study, the Board in 2002 issued an RFP, received 80-odd proposals, and selected 9 projects for full or co-funding. This undoubtedly contributed to the subsequent flowering of empirical research on intellectual property systems and policies.

More typical of the Academy, STEP work has helped shape the agendas of investigators and research sponsors. A prime example is the 2001 workshop, Using Human Resource Data to Track Innovation, whose premise was that studying the qualifications, career paths, and activities of industrial scientists, engineers, and other professionals could reveal a great deal about innovation processes, especially those beyond the R&amp;D stage. The workshop has shaped the subsequent work of Paula Stephan, who was commissioned to write the principal paper for the meeting, and led directly to a series of NSF workshops, other research initiatives, and efforts to improve the utility of data from the NSF surveys of PhD-holders. A community of investigators is exploring ways to match publication and patent data with NSF human resource data. Stephan attributes all of this activity directly to the seminal STEP workshop.

== Domestic policy impact ==
STEP reports have had a demonstrable impact on public policy discussions and outcomes. Examples include:

''A Patent System for the 21st Century'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Richard C. and Mark B. Myers. (2004). A Patent System for the 21st Century. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004 a STEP committee chaired by Yale President Richard Levin and former Xerox CTO Mark Myers issued a final report of a broad study of how well the U.S. patent system is fulfilling its purpose of encouraging research, innovation, and the dissemination of knowledge and how it is adapting to rapid technological and economic changes. It found that while the system has shown admirable flexibility in accommodating new technologies, there is reason to be concerned about the quality of issued patents, the resources available to the US Patent and Trademark Office to keep up with the pace of technological change and volume of applications, features of U.S. law that inhibit the dissemination of information contained in patents and that raise the cost and uncertainty of litigation over patent validity and infringement, access to patented research technologies for basic non-commercial research, and redundancies and inconsistencies among national patent systems that raise the cost of global intellectual property protection.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. and Mark B. Myers. (2004). A Patent System for the 21st Century. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press&lt;/ref&gt; With dedicated dissemination funds provided by the NRC, a private foundation, and several companies and law firms, a very extensive outreach effort, involving public meetings across the country, was undertaken. The committee co-chairs were lead-off witnesses in Senate and House patent reform hearings in the spring of 2005 and again in 2007. Five of the report’s seven recommendations are core provisions of legislation introduced by the committee chairs in the 109th Congress and expected to be re-introduced in the 110th.

* ''Trends in Federal Support of Research and Graduate Education'' (2001). Using data collected by NSF annually from federal agencies but rarely analyzed, this report documented in detail significant shifts in the allocation of public research spending and graduate student support in the 1990s and related these to state, foundation, and industry funding patterns. It found a substantial real decline in federal investment in most of the physical sciences and engineering fields and corresponding declines in the number of federally supported graduate students in those fields.&lt;ref&gt;The National Research Council of The National Academies. Committee on Trends in Federal Spending on Scientific and Engineering Research. (2001). Trends in Federal Support of Research and Graduate Education. Washington, D. C. The National Academies Press&lt;/ref&gt; The report was cited by the Senate Appropriations Committee, OSTP Director Jack Marburger, then NSF Director Rita Colwell, and the Semiconductor Industry Association. It contributed to the recommendations of the President’s committee of Advisers on Science and Technology (PCAST), Council on Competitiveness, and COSEPUP Augustine panel, the President’s 2007 budget, and bipartisan congressional majorities for significant increases in the federal funding of physical science and engineering research.
* ''The Advanced Technology Program: Assessing Outcomes'' (2001). This report represented a comprehensive review of the operations of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), administered by the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to accelerate development of high-risk technologies with promising economic benefits through cost-shared funding. The study committee concluded that the program has shown considerable success attributable in part to appropriate selection criteria, rigorous peer review of technical feasibility and commercial potential, and careful evaluation of outcomes. The report was the subject of a hearing before the House Science Committee and was cited by the Senate Appropriations Committee in justifying an increase in ATP’s funding. STEP’s evaluation is undoubtedly a factor in ATP’s survival despite repeated administration proposals and House of Representative votes to terminate the program. NIST recently issued a solicitation for new ATP proposals.

===International reputation===
In part through the Board’s outreach efforts and in part because of interest abroad in the contributions of federal and state government policy to U.S. economic performance, there is a growing international audience for STEP’s work, evidenced by the high volume of visits to the website and invitations for presentations to international organizations (e.g., various committees of the OECD, parts of the European Commission, World Intellectual Property Organization, and European Patent Office), and national government officials and international academic gatherings too numerous to list. Originally confined to the industrial countries this interest has extended to the governments of and academics in the emerging economies – China, India, Brazil, Vietnam, and the former Soviet republics.

STEP has received project support from the [[OECD]], [[European Commission]], [[Industry Canada]], and Embassy of the United Kingdom. A formal collaboration with two of the German economic research institutes yielded two reports, and in 1995 STEP was asked to host an international conference on technology and jobs preparatory to the G-7 Summit meeting.

Congress is a principal consumer of STEP work, and the Board has conducted or is conducting three congressionally mandated projects. A fourth mandate – the ongoing evaluation of 5 agencies’ SBIR programs – followed STEP work on SBIR but has been carried out under separate oversight. Discussion is underway with members of Congress of a major study of the role of intangible assets (R&amp;D, intellectual property, software, worker training, and organizational competence) in economic growth. Nevertheless, what will appear in final legislation or bill report language is always highly uncertain; and agency compliance with congressional study mandates is not assured. STEP has twice negotiated language with congressional sponsors for studies that were eventually included in enacted legislation and developed proposals to the executive agencies directed to contract with the Academies, but the mandates were not executed.

'''Carl Horst Hahn''' (born 1 July 1926) is a German businessman and former head of the [[Volkswagen Group]] from 1982 to 1993. He served as the chairman of the board of management of the [[parent company]], Volkswagen AG (formerly Volkswagenwerk AG). During his tenure, the group's car production increased from two million units in 1982 to 3.5 million a decade later.

== Early life and education ==
Hahn was born in the German state of [[Saxony]] and raised near [[Chemnitz]]. His father had been a senior manager of the German car and motorcycle company [[DKW]] and was a co-founder of the [[Auto Union]] in 1932, which later evolved into the [[Audi]] car brand. 
As a college student, he studied business administration at the [[University of Cologne]] and the [[University of Zurich]], economics and politics in [[Great Britain]] and [[France]]. In 1952, Hahn received his doctorate in Economics at the [[University of Berne]] in [[Switzerland]]. He went to Perugia for a year to study art history, intending to volunteer at Fiat.&lt;ref name=ch&gt;[http://www.hahn-carl.de/biographie.html Carl H. Hahn] Carl und Marisa Hahn-Stiftung, n.d. retrieved 25 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Before joining Volkswagen, he worked as an [[economist]] at the OECD in Paris in the der European Productivity Agency.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;
In 1953 Hahn joined VW as an assistant of chairman [[Heinrich Nordhoff]], and quickly became head of sales promotion in VW's export department. Hahn was a favorite of Nordhoff's. 

===Volkswagen of America, 1959–1965===
In 1959, Nordhoff made him president of the company's U.S. subsidiary, [[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}Under Hahn's leadership, Volkswagen of America began a national advertising campaign to attract more attention to its quirky Beetle sedan and Microbus wagon.  Hahn soon hired the [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]] ad agency, which created some of the most memorable car ads in history.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Its print and television ads for the Volkswagen brand respected the customer's intelligence, gave detailed information about Volkswagen's products, and made fun of the unorthodox qualities of the cars.  The ads became cultural icons as much as the cars did, and Volkswagen enjoyed phenomenal sales in the U.S. in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Hahn became a beloved figure in the United States before his return to Germany in 1965, having been affectionately nicknamed "Mr. Volkswagen" by VW enthusiasts. While stationed in America, Hahn married Marisa Lea Traina (whose brother later married romance novelist [[Danielle Steel]]); their four children were all born in the U.S.

===Chairman of Volkswagen AG,1982–1993===
In 1973, Hahn left VW and returned to Hannover, Germany to lead the German tire company [[Continental AG]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}
In 1982, he returned to become chairman of Volkswagenwerk AG. Under his leadership, Volkswagen entered a cooperation agreement with the Spanish car brand [[SEAT]] in 1982, bought a majority interest in 1986, and by 1990 owned the entire company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.seat.com/en/company/368-seat-hoy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718053942/http://media.seat.com/en/company/368-seat-hoy.html |archivedate=2009-07-18 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1985, Hahn was able to push VW's earnings up 140 percent to $225 million based on sales of more than $21 billion, and he was credited for pushing VW beyond the one-car strategy left over from the era of air-cooled Beetles and the early success of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1]] in the 1970s.{{cn|date=July 2017}} 
The [[Volkswagen Golf Mk2|second-generation edition]], introduced in Europe in 1983 and in North America in 1984, was one of the bestselling cars of the 1980s worldwide.{{clarify|reason= connection to page title? |date=July 2017}}

Despite Hahn's earlier success in leading Volkswagen of America, VW sales in the United States dropped during his tenure as VW chairman, from 171,281 units in 1982 to 75,873 in 1992, largely to due intense competition from American and Japanese carmakers, and sales in Canada were hardly better.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Another issue in North America was substandard product. {{cn|date=July 2017}} Soon after Hahn became chairman of VW, he tested an American Volkswagen Rabbit built at the [[Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant]], which had opened in 1978, and he was deeply disappointed. "It felt like a Chevrolet," he complained.  "If you want a Chevrolet, you should go to General Motors."{{cn|date=July 2017}}The car had been re-engineered to drive like an American family sedan, with softer suspension and shock absorbers.  Hahn fired Volkswagen of America president [[James McLernon]], a former Chevrolet engineer who had been tapped by VW to get the Westmoreland plant up and running.  Hahn brought in new management and kept the Westmoreland factory open to produce the second-generation Golf as a hedge against currency fluctuation between the German mark (DM) and the U.S. dollar, but inefficient production and soft sales in North America caused VW to close the plant in 1988.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

After [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] in 1991 Volkswagen entered a joint venture with the Czech company [[Škoda Auto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.skoda-auto.com/com/about/tradition/history/Pages/History.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217001803/http://new.skoda-auto.com/com/about/tradition/history/Pages/History.aspx |archivedate=2010-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hahn's acquisitions made Volkswagen a global force, and affirmed its place as Europe's largest automaker.{{cn|date=July 2017}}   
Hahn also cleaned up VW's business practices,{{according to whom|date=July 2017}} uncovering an inside [[foreign exchange fraud]], but its $300 million cost to Volkswagen ate into the very profits Hahn had helped the company make.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Legacy==
Although Hahn was applauded for making the [[Volkswagen Golf]] the most popular car in Europe, and expanding the company through the SEAT and Škoda acquisitions, Volkswagen was in financial trouble by the end of his tenure as chairman, having lost 770 million marks in the eighties surge of the European car market, maintaining a low after-tax profit margin of 2.8 percent.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Pre-tax profits went from three billion marks in 1989 to 1.785 billion marks just three years later. Hahn could not keep manufacturing and development costs under control.{{cn|date=July 2017}}  The Volkswagen board decided that Hahn had been at the helm of Volkswagen too long, and replaced him with [[Ferdinand Piëch]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Former Volkswagen of America president Bill Young, in an interview with journalist David Kiley, explained Hahn's record as chairman of VW: "Dr. Hahn had a lot on his plate in the 1980s, and [VW was] an organization that he was not suited or equipped to turn upside down the way Piech did." Automotive journalist [[David E. Davis]] offered a mixed review: "Hahn is a terrific man, and he did a lot of good things for Volkswagen, but he obviously lost interest in the American market by the time he came back in the 1980s based on the lack of attention the American division got."

'''Cost the limit of price''' was a maxim coined by [[Josiah Warren]], indicating a (prescriptive) version of the [[labor theory of value]]. Warren maintained that the [[Justice|just]] compensation for labor (or for its product) could only be an equivalent amount of labor (or a product embodying an equivalent amount).&lt;ref name=warren1&gt;In ''Equitable Commerce'', Warren writes, "If a priest is required to get a soul out of purgatory, he sets his price according to the value which the relatives set upon his prayers, instead of their cost to the priest. This, again, is cannibalism. The same amount of labor equally disagreeable, with equal wear and tear, performed by his customers, would be a just remuneration&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[profit (economics)|profit]], [[renting|rent]], and [[interest]] were considered unjust economic arrangements. As [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] put it, "the labor theory of value recognizes no distinction between profit and plunder."&lt;ref name=mcelroy&gt;Wendy McElroy, "[https://web.archive.org/web/19980206075653/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/mcelroy1.html Individualist Anarchism vs. "Libertarianism" and Anarchocommunism]," in the ''New Libertarian'', issue #12, October, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the tradition of [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Smith writes: "The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it." Note, also, the sense of "labor" meaning "suffering."&lt;/ref&gt; the "cost" of labor is considered to be the [[subjectivity|subjective]] cost; i.e., the amount of suffering involved in it.&lt;ref name="warren1"/&gt;

== Development ==

The principle was set forth in Warren's ''Equitable Commerce'' (among other writings) and has been called a "mainstay of 19th century [[individualist anarchism]]."&lt;ref name="mcelroy"/&gt; It was further advocated and popularized by [[Benjamin Tucker]] in his individualist anarchist periodical ''Liberty'', and in his books. Tucker explained it so:

{{Quote|From [[Adam Smith|Smith's]] principle that labor is the true measure of price{{spaced ndash}}or, as Warren phrased it, that cost is the proper limit of price{{spaced ndash}}these three men [i.e., [[Josiah Warren]], [[Pierre Proudhon]], and [[Karl Marx]]] made the following deductions: that the natural wage of labor is its product; that this wage, or product, is the only just source of income (leaving out, of course, gift, inheritance, etc.); that all who derive income from any other source abstract it directly or indirectly from the natural and just wage of labor; that this abstracting process generally takes one of three forms,{{spaced ndash}}interest, rent, and profit; that these three constitute the trinity of [[usury]], and are simply different methods of levying [[tribute]] for the use of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]; that, capital being simply stored-up labor which has already received its pay in full, its use ought to be gratuitous, on the principle that labor is the only basis of price; that the lender of capital is entitled to its return intact, and nothing more; that the only reason why the banker, the stockholder, the landlord, the manufacturer, and the merchant are able to exact usury from labor lies in the fact that they are backed by legal privilege...|Benjamin Tucker
|"[https://web.archive.org/web/19990117030925/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html State Socialism and Anarchism]," from ''Individual Liberty'', Vanguard Press, New York, 1926}}

Warren put his principle into practice in 1827 by establishing an experimental "equity store," called the [[Cincinnati Time Store]], where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. This scheme was exactly that advocated by [[Pierre Proudhon]] some years later under the name ''[[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutuellisme]]''; however, it is believed that Proudhon developed his ideas independently.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin]], "[https://web.archive.org/web/20001215195500/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/kropotkin/defanarchy.html Anarchism]," from the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown San Antonio''' is the [[central business district]] of [[San Antonio, Texas]], [[United States]]. It also serves as the urban core of [[Greater San Antonio]], a metropolitan area with nearly 2.5 million people.
In addition to being encircled by Loops [[Texas State Highway Loop 1604|1604]] and [[Interstate 410|410]], Downtown San Antonio is encircled by three Interstate [[freeway]]s: [[Interstate 35 in Texas|I-35]], [[Interstate 37 (Texas)|I-37]], and [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]]. Together, the three highways create a rectangular route around the city's urban core: I-35 to the north and west, I-37 to the east, and I-10 to the south. The rectangular loop has a nine-mile circumference and is known as the "Downtown Loop" or "Central Loop", which encompasses both it and [[Neighborhoods and districts of San Antonio#South Side|Southtown]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Districts==

Downtown is home to many districts including the Alamo District, Alamodome District, Central Business District, Convention Center District, Historic Civic District, Houston Street District, Lavaca District, [[La Villita]] District, Market Square District, North Downtown, River North District, Zona cultural, San Antonio CO-OP district, River Bend District, [[King William Historic District]], South Flores Warehouse District, SoSo (South of Southtown), [[Southtown Arts District]], Eastbourough, and the University District.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The northwestern corner of Downtown is the Medical District.

The Central Business District is home to the [[Rivercenter]], anchored by a [[Macy's]], an [[IMAX]] theater, an [[H&amp;M]], and formerly [[Dillard's]]. The five-level [[Art Deco]] Dillard's, at the corner of Alamo and Commerce streets, opened in 1887 as [[Joske's]]. Joske's flagship store was {{convert|551000|sqft|m2|-2}} in floor space until Dillard's bought the Joske's chain in 1987. In August 2008, Dillard's moved out of the historic building as a part of a redevelopment plan for Rivercenter Mall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The Rivercenter Mall was built around [[St. Joseph Catholic Church (San Antonio, Texas)|St. Joseph Catholic Church]] after the church refused to move.

Many people travel to visit the Alamo Plaza Historic District, which houses the famous Alamo. Attractions such as the river walk are home to many of the festivities throughout the year including [http://www.niosa.org/ NIOSA] [[A Night in Old San Antonio]] which celebrates Fiesta, Cinco de Mayo, and numerous parades such as celebrations for their home NBA team the Spurs, Christmas parades and much more.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In the southeastern part of Downtown is the [[Alamodome]], a 65,000-seat arena that hosts many types of events, primarily conventions and football games.

While many companies based in San Antonio are based in other parts of the city, particularly the Northwest Side and Uptown, there are companies based in Downtown San Antonio, such as [[H-E-B]], [[Eye Care Centers of America]], [[Bromley Originate Change]], and [[Kell Muñoz Architects]].

'''Elsie Margaret Binger Naumburg''' (July 7, 1880 – November 25, 1953) was an [[United States|American]] [[ornithologist]].

==Biography==
Naumburg was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family in [[New York City]], the daughter of Frances (née Newgass) and Gustav Binger.&lt;ref name=JWABunger&gt;{{Cite web|last=LeCroy|first=Mary |authorlink=   |title=Elsie Margaret Binger Naumburg 1880 – 1953|publisher=Jewish Woman's Archive|date= |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/naumburg-elsie-margaret-binger  |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had three brothers: Robert Binger, [[Walter D. Binger]], and [[Carl Binger]].&lt;ref name=JWABunger /&gt; She studied at the Sachs Institute at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] and at the [[University of Munich]], and studied with [[Carl Edward Hellmayr]] for several years. On returning to the United States she joined the staff of the Bird Department at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], under [[Frank Chapman (ornithologist)|Frank Chapman]]. She specialised in South American birds.

Naumburg’s most important work was on the birds of the Matto Grosso, based on collections made by [[George Kruck Cherrie]] during [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s expedition to [[Brazil]]. She later employed [[Emil Kaempfer]] to collect birds in southeastern Brazil.

Naumburg married Victor Reichenberger in 1908, and some of her early publications were under that name. Reichenberger died in 1913, and she married [[Walter W. Naumburg]] in 1923.

'''Fernando Melciades Zevallos González''', also known as '''Fernando Melciades Zevallos Gonzáles''', is the founder and owner of what was [[Peru]]'s largest airline, [[Aero Continente]]. The airline operated from 1992 until 2004, but was forced to close that year after Mr Zevallos was added to America's list of [[drug lord|drug kingpin]]s and was Aero Continente placed on a blacklist of companies with links to [[drug traffic]]kers. The moves prevented American companies from doing business with the airline. This meant that Aero Continente could neither buy spare parts for its US-built planes nor insure them. It quickly collapsed.

Zevallos was born on July 8, 1957 in [[Mariscal Cáceres Province]], [[San Martín Region]], Perú.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treasury.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/actions/20040601.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[Peruvian Air Force]] Academy, becoming a pilot. In 1976 and following his father's death, he retired from the Air Force to look after his father's estate. He had inherited a considerable amount of money.

In 1978, the Peruvian government began a campaign of tax incentives for companies that invested in the Peruvian jungle. The Zevallos family decided to incorporate an [[air taxi]] company called ''TAUSA'', with the aim of offering aerial services to the villages of the Peruvian jungle which were not served by suitable terrestrial transport. The company was not successful and Zevallos emigrated to the [[United States]].

During this period, he founded a new company, Aero Continente. At the end of 1994, he settled in the USA permanently, prompting him to give up his shares of the company. He quit the board of Aero Continente in January 1995, later becoming an advisor.

Aero Continente grew to become one of Peru's leading airlines. But on the eve of 2004's Copa America in Peru, Aero Continente was grounded. Persistent allegations of money-laundering and drug-trafficking had dogged the company for years. At this point, the US authorities added Zavallos to their list of drug kingpins. Unable to secure insurance for his fleet, Aero Continente was grounded.

== Accusations and charges ==
Fernando Zevallos has been the subject of more than 30 investigations according to the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], although none of these have led to any criminal charges. On 2004 he was put on the US's list of drug kingpins under the [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]], labeling him one of the top drug-traffickers in the world. Terry Parham, director of the US Drug Enforcement Administration's Lima office, went on record as describing Zevallos as the "Al Capone of Perú".

The founder of Aero Continente has denied any connection with drug trafficking and has demanded that the United States government show proof of such accusations. Neither Aero Continente nor its founder Zevallos were ever tried or found guilty of these accusations prior to their addition to the list. Zevallos has been a [[resident alien|Permanent legal resident of the United States]] for over 15 years and was quoted as calling his inclusion to The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act "unconstitutional" since he was denied his right to due process.&lt;ref name="urlwww.criminaljustice.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criminaljustice.org/public.nsf/testimony/200009?OpenDocument |title=www.criminaljustice.org |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his home country, Zevallos had faced charges of contract murder, cocaine trafficking and money laundering, but had never been convicted of any such allegation. In November 2005, a Peruvian court found him guilty of drugs-trafficking offenses. He was sentenced to 20 years in jail and barred from holding public office. This was his only conviction, and he was convicted over a year following his inclusion to the controversial Kingpin Act. Zevallos's attorney claims that due to the tremendous pressure of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Bush administration, a conviction in Peru was just a matter of time. Zevallos' defense appeal is still pending, due to be heard by Peru's Supreme Court. Zevallos has also filed a complaint to the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]].

In November 2006, accusations emerged to suggest Zevallos had deep links with Peru's disgraced former spy-chief, [[Vladimiro Montesinos]]. The accusations were made by convicted drug dealer Jorge ''Polaco'' Chavez Montoya. Both Zevallos and Montesinos have denied any links.

In July 2007 he was indicted for allegedly conspiring to violate the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. 

On September 2007 a request, on behalf of Fernando Zevallos, was made to the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, requesting that he be extradited to the United States of America to face charges. Peru and the United States have an extradition treaty that allows the extradition of individuals for a specific short period, while facing trial or even after conviction. The request was denied, but Zevallos’ defense has requested his extradition to the United States again in January 2009. The results are still pending.

'''''Fortune''''' is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] business magazine headquartered in [[New York City]], [[United States]]. It is published and owned by [[Meredith Corporation]]. The publication was founded by [[Henry Luce]] in 1929. The magazine competes with ''[[Forbes]]'' and ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' in the national business magazine category and distinguishes itself with long, in-depth feature articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Shaper of Magazines Retires |first=Deirdre |last=Carmody |newspaper=New York Times |date=May 2, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/02/business/the-media-business-a-shaper-of-magazines-retires.html |access-date=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine regularly publishes ranked lists, perhaps best known is the [[Fortune 500]], a ranking of companies by revenue that it has published annually since 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What Happened to the First Fortune 500? |first=Erika |last=Fry |magazine=Fortune |date=June 2, 2014 |url=http://fortune.com/2014/06/02/first-fortune-500/ |access-date=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Fortune'' was founded by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' co-founder Henry Luce in 1929 as "the Ideal Super-Class Magazine", a "distinguished and de luxe" publication "vividly portraying, interpreting and recording the Industrial Civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Fortune prospectus. By Henry Luce. Fortune, September 1929, Volume One, Number Zero.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Briton Hadden]], Luce's business partner, was not enthusiastic about the idea – which Luce originally thought to title ''Power'' – but Luce went forward with it after Hadden's sudden death on February 27, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Luce &amp; His Time by Joseph Epstein, ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', Vol. 44, No. 5, November 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 1929, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] occurred, marking the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. In a memo to the Time Inc. board in November 1929, Luce wrote: "We will not be over-optimistic. We will recognize that this business slump may last as long as an entire year."&lt;ref name=works&gt;{{cite news |title=How the World Really Works | author = [[Daniel Okrent|Okrent, Daniel]] |work=Fortune|date=September 19, 2005 |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/09/19/8272901/index.htm  |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication made its official debut in February 1930. Its editor was Luce, managing editor Parker Lloyd-Smith, and art director [[Thomas Maitland Cleland]].&lt;ref&gt;"Current Magazines". ''[[The New York Times]]''. February 2, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;
Single copies of the first issue cost US$1 (${{Inflation|US|1|1930|r=2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref name=works /&gt; An urban legend says that Cleland mocked up the cover of the first issue with the $1 price because no one had yet decided how much to charge; the magazine was printed before anyone realized it, and when people saw it for sale, they thought that the magazine must really have worthwhile content. In fact, there were 30,000 subscribers who had already signed up to receive that initial 184-page issue. By 1937, the number of subscribers had grown to 460,000, and the magazine had turned half million dollars in annual profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fortune |first=Laura |last=Massey |newspaper=Peter Harrington London |date=December 11, 2010 |url=http://www.peterharrington.co.uk/blog/fortune/ |access-date= August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a time when business publications were little more than numbers and statistics printed in black and white, ''Fortune'' was an oversized 11"×14", using creamy heavy paper, and art on a cover printed by a special process.&lt;ref name=uva&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~1930s/Print/fortune/background.html Background].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fortune'' was also noted for its photography, featuring the work of [[Margaret Bourke-White]], [[Ansel Adams]], and others.  [[Walker Evans]] served as its photography editor from 1945 to 1965.

During the Great Depression, the magazine developed a reputation for its social conscience, for [[Walker Evans]] and [[Margaret Bourke-White]]'s color photographs, and for a team of writers including [[James Agee]], [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], and [[Alfred Kazin]], hired specifically for their writing abilities. The magazine became an important leg of Luce's media empire; after the successful launch of ''Time'' in 1923 and ''Fortune'' in 1930, Luce went on to launch ''Life'' in 1936 and ''Sports Illustrated'' in 1954.

From its launch in 1930 to 1978, ''Fortune'' was published monthly. In January 1978, it began publishing biweekly. In October 2009, citing declining [[advertising]] revenue and [[newspaper circulation|circulation]], ''Fortune'' began publishing every three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/fortune-magazine-will-drop-from-25-to-18-issues-a-year/ |title=Fortune Magazine Will Drop From 25 to 18 Issues a Year |author= [[Richard Pérez-Peña|Pérez-Peña, Richard]] |date= October 23, 2009 |work= [[The New York Times]] |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/fortune-magazine-will-drop-from-25-to-18-issues-a-year/ |title=Fortune Media Kit |date= October 23, 2009|work= [[The New York Times]] |access-date= | author= [[Richard Pérez-Peña|Pérez-Peña, Richard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently ''Fortune'' is published 14 times a year. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://subscription.fortune.com/storefront/subscribe-to-fortune/site/fo-bundletest2trm0118-tpl.html?link=1022055&amp;fpa_oc=FO+0218+AA+Test+OWN|title=Fortune Magazine Subscription|website=subscription.fortune.com|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall Loeb]] was named managing editor in 1986. During his tenure at ''Fortune'', Loeb was credited with expanding the traditional focus on business and the economy with added graphs, charts, and tables, as well as the addition of articles on topics such as executive life and social issues connected to the world of business, including the effectiveness of public schools and on homelessness.&lt;ref name=NYT1994&gt;{{cite news |title=The Media Business; A Shaper of Magazines Retires |first=Carmody |last=Deirdre |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 2, 1994 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E2DA1330F931A35756C0A962958260 |access-date=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years when [[Time Warner]] owned Time Inc., ''Fortune'' articles (as well as those from ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazine) were hosted at [[CNNMoney.com]].

In June 2014, after Time Inc. spun off from its corporate parent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Primack|first1=Dan|title=Time Inc.

On November 9, 2018, it was announced that [[Meredith Corporation]] was selling ''Fortune'' to Thai billionaire Chatchaval Jiaravanon for $150 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/fortune-magazine-sale-chatchaval-jiaravanon&lt;/ref&gt;  Jiaravanon is affiliated with the Thailand-based conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group, which has holdings in agriculture, telecommunications, retail, pharmaceutical, and finance.&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2018/11/09/thai-business-tycoon-buys-fortune-magazine-for-150-million/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hacienda''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|h|æ|s|i|ˈ|ɛ|n|d|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|h|ɑː|s|i|ˈ|ɛ|n|d|ə}}; {{IPA-es|aˈθjenda|lang}} or {{IPA-es|aˈsjenda|}}), in the [[colony|colonies]] of the [[Spanish Empire]], is an [[Estate (land)|estate]], similar in form to a [[Roman villa]]. Some haciendas were [[plantation]]s, [[Mining|mines]] or [[Factory|factories]]. Many haciendas combined these activities. The word is derived from the Spanish word "hacer" or "haciendo", which means: to make or be making, respectively; and were largely business enterprises consisting of various money making ventures including raising farm animals and maintaining orchards.

The term ''hacienda'' is imprecise, but usually refers to landed estates of significant size.  Smaller holdings were termed [[estancias]] or [[ranch]]os that were owned almost exclusively by Spaniards and [[Criollo people|criollo]]s and in rare cases by mixed-race individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ida Altman]], et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, the term [[estancia]] is used for large estates that in Mexico would be termed haciendas. In recent decades, the term has been used in the United States to refer to an architectural style associated with the earlier estate manor houses.

The hacienda system of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Mexico]], [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], and [[Peru]] was a system of large land holdings. A similar system existed on a smaller scale in the [[Philippines]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

==Origins and growth==
Haciendas were developed as profit-making, economic enterprises linked to regional or international markets. Although the hacienda is not directly linked to the early grants of indigenous American labor, the [[encomienda]], many Spanish holders of encomiendas did acquire land or develop enterprises where they had access to that forced labor. Even though the private landed estates that constituted most haciendas did not have a direct tie to the encomienda, they are nonetheless linked. Encomenderos were in a position to retain their prominence economically via the hacienda. Since the encomienda was a grant from the crown, holders were dependent on the crown for its continuation. As the crown moved to eliminate the encomienda with its labor supply, Spaniards consolidated private landholdings and recruited free labor on a permanent or casual basis. The long term trend then was the creation of the hacienda as secure private property, which survived the colonial period and into the 20th century. Estates were integrated into a [[market economy|market-based economy]] aimed at the Hispanic sector and cultivated crops such as [[sugar]], [[wheat]], fruits and vegetables and produced animal products such as meat, [[wool]], leather, and [[tallow]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]], "Encomienda and Hacienda: The Evolution of the Great Estate in the Spanish Indies," ''Hispanic American Historical Review,'' 1969, 59: 411-29,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LockhartSchwartz&gt;James Lockhart and [[Stuart B. Schwartz|Stuart Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America: A History of Colonial Spanish America and Brazil,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983, pp. 134–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Teatro de Atequiza, Mexico.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gristmill|Wheat mill]] and theatre of [[Gilberto Rincón Gallardo|Vicente Gallardo]]; Hacienda Atequiza, [[Jalisco, Mexico]], 1886.]]
Haciendas originated in Spanish [[land grant]]s, made to many ''[[conquistador]]s'' and crown officials, but many ordinary Spaniards could also petition for land grants from the crown. The system is considered to have started in present-day Mexico, when the Spanish Crown granted to [[Hernán Cortés]] the title of [[Marquis]] of the [[Valley of Oaxaca]] in 1529. It gave him a tract of land that included all of the present state of [[Morelos]]. Cortés was also granted encomiendas, that gave him access to a vast pool of indigenous labor.

==Personnel==
In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], the owner of an hacienda was called the ''hacendado'' or ''patrón''. Most owners of large and profitable haciendas preferred to live in Spanish cities, often near the hacienda, but in Mexico, the richest owners lived in Mexico City, visiting their haciendas at intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Rendón Garcini, ''Daily Life on the Haciendas of Mexico,'' Banamex-Accova;S/A/ de C.V., Mexico: 1998, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Onsite management of the rural estates was by a paid administrator or manager, which was similar to the arrangement with the encomienda. Administrators were often hired for a fixed term of employment, receiving a salary and at times some share of the profits of the estate.  Some administrators also acquired landholdings themselves in the area of the estate they were managing.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al. (2003), ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' pp. 165–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work force on haciendas varied, depending on the type of hacienda and where it was located.  In central Mexico near indigenous communities and growing crops to supply urban markets, there was often a small, permanent workforce resident on the hacienda.  Labor could be recruited from nearby indigenous communities on an as-needed basis, such as planting and harvest time.&lt;ref name=LockhartSchwartz /&gt; The permanent and temporary hacienda employees worked land that belonged to the ''patrón'' and under the supervision of local labor bosses. In some places small scale cultivators or ''campesinos'' worked small holdings belonging to the hacendado, and owed a portion of their crops to him. In a number of places, the economy of the 18th century was largely a [[barter]] system,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} with little specie circulated on the ''hacienda''.

Stock raising was central to ranching haciendas, the largest of which were in areas without dense indigenous populations, such as northern Mexico, but as indigenous populations declined in central areas, more land became available for grazing.&lt;ref&gt;Altman et al. (2003), ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock were animals originally imported from Spain, including cattle, horses, sheep, and goats were part of the [[Columbian Exchange]] and produced significant ecological changes.  Sheep in particular had a devastating impact on the environment due to overgrazing.&lt;ref&gt;Elinor G. K. Melville, ''A Plague of Sheep: Environmental Consequences of the Conquest of Mexico," Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Mounted ranch hands variously called ''[[vaquero]]s'' and ''[[gaucho]]s'' (in the [[Southern Cone]]), among other terms worked for pastoral haciendas.

Where the hacienda included working [[mining|mine]]s, as in Mexico, the ''patrón'' might gain immense wealth. The unusually large and profitable [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] ''hacienda'' Santa Lucía, near Mexico City, established in 1576 and lasting to the expulsion in 1767, has been reconstructed by Herman Konrad from archival sources. This reconstruction has revealed the nature and operation of the hacienda system in Mexico, its labor force, its systems of [[land tenure]] and its relationship to larger Hispanic society in Mexico.

[[File:Hacienda San Gabriel.jpg|thumb|left|Gardens of the Hacienda San Gabriel in [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato]], [[Mexico]].]]
The [[Catholic Church]] and  [[Catholic religious order|orders]], especially the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], acquired vast ''hacienda'' holdings or preferentially loaned money to the hacendados. As the hacienda owners' mortgage holders, the Church's interests  were connected with the landholding class.   In the history of Mexico and other [[Latin America]]n countries, the masses developed some hostility to the church; at times of gaining independence or during certain political movements, the people confiscated the church haciendas or restricted them.

Haciendas in the [[Caribbean]] were developed primarily as sugar [[plantation]]s, dependent on the labor of [[African peoples|African]] [[Slavery in the Spanish Empire|slaves]] imported to the region. were staffed by slaves brought from [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Diaz"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071214000250/http://www.ipoaa.com/africa_puertorico.htm African Aspects of the Puerto Rican Personality by (the late) Dr. Robert A.

==South American haciendas==
In [[South America]], the ''hacienda'' remained after the [[Spanish American wars of independence|collapse]] of the [[Spanish Empire|colonial system]] in the early 19th century when nations gained independence. In some places, such as [[Dominican Republic]], with independence came efforts to break up the large plantation holdings into a myriad of small [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers']] holdings, an agrarian revolution. In Argentina and elsewhere, a second, international, money-based economy developed independently of the ''haciendas'', which sank into rural poverty.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
[[File:Entrada al Palacio San José.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palacio San José]], Argentina; owned by [[Justo José de Urquiza]], 19th century.]]

In most of [[Latin America]] the old holdings remained. In Mexico the ''haciendas'' were [[Agrarian land reform in Mexico|abolished]] by law in 1917 during the [[Mexican Revolution|revolution]], but remnants of the system affect Mexico today.  In rural areas, the wealthiest people typically affect the style of the old hacendados even though their wealth these days derives from more capitalistic enterprises.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In [[Bolivia]], haciendas were more prevalent until the [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro#The 1952 Revolution|1952 Revolution]] of [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]]. He established an extensive program of land distribution as part of the [[Agrarian Reform]]. Likewise, [[Peru]] had haciendas until the Agrarian Reform (1969) of [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], who expropriated the land from the hacendados and redistributed it to the peasants.

==Other locations==

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], the hacienda system and lifestyles were influenced by the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonization]] that occurred via [[Mexico]] for more than 300 years. Attempts to break up the hacienda system in the Philippines through [[land reform]] laws during the second half of the 1900s have not been successful. There were protests related to the [[Hacienda Luisita]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

'''HeadBlade''' is a [[head shaving]] [[razor]] brand produced by '''The HeadBlade Company'''. Founded by Todd Greene, a 1989 graduate of [[Bowdoin College]], HeadBlade is headquartered in Gardena, California.

== Products ==

HeadBlade’s first commercial product was the HeadBlade Classic, introduced in 1999. The unorthodox design of the Classic was made as a response to the difficulties of head shaving with a regular razor.

The HeadBlade Classic went on to win the IDSA Silver Award for Design Excellence, as well as a spot in [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine’s]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,91439,00.html|title=Best Design 2000|date=2000-12-10|work=Time|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Ten Best Designs of 2000.” In 2005, the Classic was also added to the Permanent Collection at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/89541|title=Todd Greene. "HeadBlade" Razor. 1997-99 {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company began to grow, HeadBlade expanded into a variety of hair care products, including HeadSlick, a specially designed shaving cream, HeadShed Scrub, an exfoliating solution and HeadLube, a scalp moisturizing lotion. Greene also continued improving on the design of his original product.
[[File:Headblade moto.jpg|thumb|The HeadBlade MOTO]]
In 2006, seven years after first introducing the Classic, HeadBlade released the HeadBlade Sport. The Sport kept the same general shape and function as the classic, but added an improved rubber grip to the finger ring and upper pad. Inspired by sport car design, it also added hardened rubber wheels and an improved axel to increase the mobility of the razor. 

In 2012, HeadBlade came out with the HeadBlade ATX. With a design inspired by an all terrain vehicle, the ATX changed the position of the blade to the back of the razor, encouraging action by “pulling” the blade along the head rather than “pushing” it. This was done in order to reduce the learning curve for people who were accustomed to regular razors.

The latest HeadBlade model is the HeadBlade MOTO, which was released in late 2016. The MOTO was awarded a [[Red Dot Design Award]] in 2017 for it’s industrial design and it’s ease of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.headblade.com/blog/headblade-wins-coveted-red-dot-2017-award/|title=HeadBlade Wins coveted Red Dot 2017 Award!!|date=2017-04-05|work=HeadBlade|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[GQ (magazine)|''GQ'' magazine ]] named Todd Greene to the 2010 Bald 100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201010/bald-100#slide=60]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hoo Ah Kay''' ({{zh|c=胡亞基|p=Hú Yàjī}}; 1816 - 27 March 1880), {{small|[[Order of St Michael and St George|C.M.G]]}}, better known as '''Whampoa''' ({{zh|c=黃埔|p=Huángbù}}), was a Singaporean businessman and community leader. An immigrant to [[Singapore]] from China, he held many high-ranking posts in Singapore, including [[Consul (representative)#Honorary consul|honourable consul]] to Japan, Russia and China.

==Early life==
Hoo Ah Kay (Hu Hsuan-tse{{Sfn|Godley|2002|p=217}}) was born 1816, in [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Whampoa]], near [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (now known as Huangpu district, Guangzhou city) in China.{{Sfn|Godley|2002|p=67}} He immigrated to Singapore in 1830.&lt;ref name="Edu 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learnat.edumall.sg/learnat/slot/u101/singaporerivertrail/sec/G041_Dunman_Sec/pioneers_of_singapore.htm |title=Business Giants from the Singapore River |publisher=Edumall |accessdate=26 May 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially working with his businessman father at food supplier Whampoa and Co., Hoo inherited the establishment after his father died.&lt;ref name="French 1"/&gt;

==Career==
Hoo received the honorific ''Mr. Whampoa'' for his political achievements and contributions to the Singaporean society.{{Sfn|Godley|2002|p=67}} He is cited as both "the first Japanese honorable consul in Singapore" and "the first Chinese consul [in Singapore]", two posts he was given in 1879 and 1877 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA681 |page=681 |first=Keat Gin |last=Ooi |title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to Timor. R–Z |volume=3 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2004 |isbn=9781576077702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1859, Hoo played a key role in establishing the [[Singapore Botanic Gardens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/botanic-gardens-gets-pioneer-hoo-ah-kays-artefacts |title=Botanic Gardens gets pioneer Hoo Ah Kay's artefacts |last=Zaccheus |first=Melody |date=2013-10-29 |work=The Straits Times |access-date=2018-08-21 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]). In 1869, he was announced as the first Legislative Council member of Chinese ethnicity by the British,{{Sfn|Godley|2002|p=68}} albeit an unofficial one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhBMmG9yXgYC&amp;pg=PA57 |last=Corfield |first=Justin |pages=57– |title=Historical Dictionary of Singapore |year=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810873872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a retail dealer specialising in ships working for the [[British Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name="French 1"/&gt; For a period of time he ran a business supplying ice imported from the United States to Singapore; it folded in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bMuAQAAIAAJ |title=The eagle in the Lion City: America, Americans and Singapore |first=James Michael |last=Baker |pages=45– |publisher=Landmark Books |year=2005 |isbn=9789814189040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoo was hailed as "one of the most influential Chinese (Cantonese) tycoons in Singapore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mfCzrbOn80C&amp;pg=PA13 |pages=13– |title=The Japanese in colonial Southeast Asia |last=Takashi |first=Shiraishi |year=1993 |publisher=SEAP |isbn=9780877274025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Order of St Michael and St George]], Class Companion (CMG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RuI9TouoM58C&amp;pg=PA257 |page=257 |title=Studies in the Social History of China and South-East Asia: Essays in Memory of Victor Purcell |year=2010 |first=Nicholas |last=Tarling |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521133746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, he became the first Asian member of the [[Legislative Council of Singapore|Legislative Council]] and within a few years was made an extraordinary member of the [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]], the only Chinese to have held this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCRUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37 |page=37 |title=The Swiss in Singapore |year=2013 |first= Andreas |last=Zangger |publisher=Didier Millet |isbn=9814385689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hoo was described as having led a rich and glamorous lifestyle, occasionally organizing elaborate meals, mostly intended for overseas visitors. He would hire many dancers to perform for him, as well as personal servants to fan him, as depicted in an illustration by English painter Edward Cree.&lt;ref name="French 1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nnEqCeicbEC&amp;pg=PA43 |pages=43– |title=The French in Singapore: An Illustrated History (1819–today) |last=Pilon |first=Maxime |publisher=Editions Didier Millet |year=2012 |isbn=9789814260442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also owned a few race horses; one of them reportedly earned him about a hundred thousand dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ob2zM78cLhYC&amp;pg=PA72 |pages=72– |title=Sport in Asian Society: Past and Present |last=Mangan |first=James A. |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780714653426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoo frequently let the public at large visit his residence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYczRd6N5CwC&amp;pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=Singapore in Global History |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |year=2007 |isbn=9789048514373 |first=Derek |last=Thiam }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was depicted as sprawling with lush greenery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SePs8fNILS0C&amp;pg=PA75 |page=75 |title=Singapore: City of Gardens |first=William |last=Warren |publisher=Tuttle |year=2000 |isbn=9789625931555 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being eloquent in the English language, he maintained a Chinese personality, preferring to wear Chinese robes. His son Hoo Ah Yip ({{zh|c=胡亞業|p=Hú Yàyè}}), was educated in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. When his son snipped off his [[Queue (hairstyle)|ponytail]] and converted to Christianity, Hoo Ah Kay was written to have been "outraged".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S2EXN8JTwAEC&amp;pg=PA292 |page=292 |first=P.J. |last=Marshall |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521002547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Hoo Ah Kay died on 27 March 1880, aged 64.&lt;ref name="Edu 1"/&gt; ''Whampoa Road'' in [[Novena]], Singapore is named after him.

{{Intellectual property}}
Typefaces, [[font]]s, and their [[glyph]]s raise [[intellectual property]] considerations in [[copyright]], trademark, design patent, and related laws. The copyright status of a typeface—and any font file that describes it digitally—varies between jurisdictions. In the United States, the shapes of typefaces are not eligible for copyright, though the shapes may be protected by design patent (although these are rarely applied for, the first US design patent ever awarded was for a typeface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=D0000001&amp;IDKey=F61340F43401&amp;HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect2%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPALL%2526S1%3DD000001.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2FD1%2526RS%3DPN%2FD1|title = Patent #: US0D0000001|date = November 9, 1842|accessdate = November 23, 2014|website = United States Patent and Trademark Office|publisher = United States Patent and Trademark Office|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Typefaces can be protected in other countries, including the UK, Germany, and France, by industrial design protections that are similar to copyright or design patent in that they protect the abstract shapes. Additionally, in the US and in some other countries, computer ''fonts''—the ''digital instantiation'' of the shapes as vector outlines—may be protected by copyright on the computer code that produces them. The name of a typeface may also be protected as a trademark.

==Copyright==

=== Germany ===

In 1981, West-Germany passed the ''Gesetz zum Wiener Abkommen vom 12. Juni 1973 über den Schutz typographischer Schriftzeichen und ihre internationale Hinterlegung'' ("Law on the 1973 Vienna Agreement for the Protection of Type Faces and their International Deposit", also simply known as ''Schriftzeichengesetz'' or "Type Faces Law"), according to which a typeface is initially protected under German copyright law for 10 years from first publication on. After the end of this initial ten-year period, the rights holder may pay a fee to prolong copyright status for additional 15 years only once. According to German law, every typeface thus ends up in the public domain after no more than 25 years from first publication onwards, after which it is also free to be digitized into a computer [[font]], which in itself holds a much higher copyright protection status by German law than analogue typefaces due to being legally classified as a computer program.

The ''name'' of a typeface can separately be registered as a [[trademark]] (''Wortmarke'') for a fee, which like a digital font also holds much higher copyright protection status than an analogue typeface itself. If a typeface's name is trademarked, no other typeface may bear the same name, not even digital clones of the analogue typeface.

=== Ireland ===

[[Irish copyright law]] covers typefaces. Like the United Kingdom law (see below), it allows for using the typeface in the ordinary course of printing. The term of protection is 15 years from first publication.&lt;ref name=irish&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0028/index.html Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000] (Ireland), §§ 84-85. Irishstatutebook.ie,  Accessed January 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===

In [[Copyright law of Japan|Japan]], typefaces have been held not to be covered by copyright, on the ground that they function primarily as a means of communicating information, rather than an appeal to aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;''Yagi v. Kashiwa Shobo K.K.'', II-1 Chosakuken Hanreishu 8 (9 Mar. 1979, Tokyo District Court) (the ''Typeface Design Case''), cited in {{cite journal |last=Karjala|first=Dennis S. |author2=Sugiyama, Keiji |title=Fundamental Concepts in Japanese and American Copyright Law |journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law |date=Autumn 1988|volume=36|issue=4|pages=613, 625–26|jstor=840277 |doi=10.2307/840277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===

In [[Copyright law of Russia|Russia]] the [[Non liquet|legal vacuum]] with soviet intellectual legacy combined with absence of specific law regulation of the fonts – created the opposite situation, where all typefaces have copyright and payments can be collected by current law. According to the Russian Yur'yev legal bureau, at least 99 [[legal threat]]s by [[Art. Lebedev Studio|Lebedev's design studio]] have been about the use of studio made typefaces in Russia without payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://juryev.ru/intellektualnaya-sobstvennost/182-shrif-objekt-avtorskogo-prava |title=Юридическое бюро Юрьева - Шрифт как объект авторского права |website=Juryev.ru |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===

In [[Copyright law of Switzerland|Switzerland]], there is no specific law for the protection of typefaces. So far, the jurisdiction has been very reluctant in admitting legal protection of any sort to typefaces. However, the denied protection is not imperative: in theory, typefaces could be protected based on both copyright and design law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vblank.ch/articles/font-protection/index-g.html |title=Valentin Blank — Schriftschutz |website=Vblank.ch |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the name of a typeface can be protected by a trademark.

=== United Kingdom ===

In 1916, England recognized copyright in typefaces, but protected only the design with all the letters in their particular order.&lt;ref&gt;"Stephenson, Blake and Co. v. Grant, Legros &amp; Co., 115 L.T.R. 666, 61 Sol. J. 55 (1916), reprinted in E.J. MacGillivray, Copyright Cases 1911-1916 326-329 (1969), aff'd 116 L.T.R. 268 (1917), noted in 13 Eng. and Empire Digest 68, 68-69. The court recognized that the typeface design was subject to copyright under the then-current Copyright Act of 1911, an Act to Amend and Consolidate the Law Relating to Copyright, 1911, 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, ch. 46 (Eng.). However, the plaintiff's victory was hollow. The court held that the copyright protected only the design in its entirety, with all the letters in their particular order. The defendant's embodiment of them into a font of his own, as opposed to a reproduction of the design with the letters in the same order, was held not to infringe. MacGillivray , supra at 327-28."  Terrence J. Carroll, [http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/chtlj/vol10/iss1/5/ Protection For Typeface Designs: A Copyright Proposal], 10 Santa Clara Computer &amp; High Tech. L.J. 139, 169, n.181.&lt;/ref&gt;  The current United Kingdom copyright statute, enacted in 1989, expressly refers to copyrights in typeface designs.&lt;ref name="UK, CDPA 1988, 48, 54"/&gt; English law does consider that fonts are subject to copyright. However, this only covers typefaces for 25 years from first publication, and does not cover their usage by typographers.&lt;ref name="UK, CDPA 1988, 48, 54" &gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/III/crossheading/typefaces Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c. 48), § 54] (England), Legislation.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Typefaces cannot be protected by copyright in the United States ([[Code of Federal Regulations]], [http://frwebgate3.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=36964326810+4+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve Ch 37, Sec. 202.1(e)]; ''Eltra Corp. vs. Ringer''). The idea that typefaces (rather than fonts, which are computer software) cannot be copyrighted in the United States is [[black letter law]]. 37 C.F.R. § 202.1(e). Under U.S. law, [[typefaces]] and their letter forms or [[glyph]]s are considered utilitarian objects whose public utility outweighs any private interest in protecting their creative elements. However, there is a distinction between a font and a typeface. The machine code used to display a stylized typeface (called a font) is protectable as copyright. In 1992, the US Copyright Office determined that digital outline fonts had elements that could be protected as software.&lt;ref name="1992_regulation"&gt;"Registrability of Computer Programs that Generate Typefaces", 57 Fed. Reg. 6201 (Feb. 21, 1992), reproduced in U.S. Copyright Office announcement [http://www.copyright.gov/history/mls/ML-443.pdf ML-443]&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the Office has accepted registration of copyright for digital vector fonts, such as PostScript Type 1, TrueType, and OpenType format files.

This is part of the basis of the 2017 lawsuit brought by Berthold LLC against Target Corporation for its alleged unlawful use of its fonts. ''Berthold v. Target'', no. 1:17-cv-07180 (N.D. Ill.). It is also part of the basis for an unpublished 1998 opinion by Judge Whyte in ''[[Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc.]]'', finding that Adobe Software held a valid copyright for its Utopia ''font'' and that it had been infringed by the defendant(s) in that case. 

Historically, the unavailability of protection for typefaces reaches back to at least 1976. In 1988, the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]] published a report titled, ''Policy Decision on Copyrightability of Digitized Typefaces'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/history/mls/ML-393.pdf |format=PDF |title=Notice of Policy Decision on Copyrightability of Digitized Typefaces |website=Copyright.gov |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explains: "The decision in ''Eltra Corp. v. Ringer'' clearly comports with the intention of the Congress. Whether typeface designs should be protected by copyright was considered and specifically rejected by Congress in passing the Copyright Act of 1976. The 1976 House Report states: A "typeface" can be defined as a set of letters, numbers, or other symbolic characters, whose forms are related by repeating design elements consistently applied in a notational system, and are intended to be embodied in articles whose intrinsic utilitarian function is for use in composing text or other cognizable combinations of characters. The Committee does not regard the design of typeface, as thus defined, to be a copyrightable "pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work" within the meaning of this bill and the application of the dividing line in section 101 [H.R. Reg. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2nd Sess 5 (1976)].

In addition to rejecting copyright protection for typeface designs, Congress deferred a decision on a more limited form of protection under proposed ornamental design legislation. Title II of the 1976 copyright revision bill as passed by the Senate could have protected typeface designs, but the House of Representatives had doubts about this limited form of protection. Consequently, only copyright revision passed. [H.R. Reg. No. 1476 at 50 and 55]. Design legislation has yet to be enacted, and Congress has chosen not to include typeface designs within the Copyright Act's definition of pictorial, graphic or sculptural works."&lt;ref name=us-co-policy&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Policy Decision on Copyrightability of Digitized Typefaces

According to section 906.4 of the ''[[Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices]]'', [[typography]] and [[calligraphy]] are also not copyrightable in themselves.&lt;ref name="Compendium313.6C2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copyright.gov/comp3/chap900/ch900-visual-art-122214.pdf |title=Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, § 906.4 ("Typeface, Typefont, Lettering, Calligraphy, and Typographic Ornamentation") |page=13 |publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]] |date=December 22, 2014 |accessdate=December 22, 2014 |quote=The copyright law does not protect typeface or mere variations of typographic ornamentation or lettering.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design patents==
Typefaces may be protected by a [[design patent]] in many countries (either automatically, by registration, or by some combination thereof). A design patent is the strongest system of protection, but the most uncommon. It is the only US legal precedent that protects the actual design (the design of the individual shapes of the letters) of the font.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; A prominent example is the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oami.europa.eu/en/design/faq/faq01.htm#200 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406114320/http://oami.europa.eu/en/design/faq/faq01.htm |date=2011-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the automatic protection (without registration) expires after three years and can be extended (by registration) up to 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oami.europa.eu/en/design/faq/faq01.htm#500 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406114320/http://oami.europa.eu/en/design/faq/faq01.htm |date=2011-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Germany passed a special extension (''Schriftzeichengesetz'') to the design patent law (''Geschmacksmustergesetz'') for protecting typeface designs. This also permits typefaces to be registered as designs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Trademarks ==
The names of particular fonts may be protected by a [[trademark]]. This is the weakest form of protection because only the font name itself is being protected.  For example, the letters that make up the trademarked font Palatino can be copied but the name must be changed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[URW++]] was involved in a 1995 lawsuit with [[Monotype Corporation]] for cloning their fonts and naming them with a name starting with the same three letters. As typeface shapes themselves cannot be copyrighted in the United States, the lawsuit centered on [[trademark infringement]]. A US court decided that Monotype's trademarks were "fanciful" and did not have descriptive value of the actual products. However it also decided that URW was confusing the public deliberately because "the purloining of the first part of a well-known trademark and the appending of it to a worthless suffix is a method of trademark poaching long condemned by the courts." The court issued an injunction preventing URW from using their chosen names.&lt;ref name="Graham1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence D. Graham|title=Legal Battles that Shaped the Computer Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6IS3RnN6qAC&amp;pg=PA47|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-56720-178-9|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensing ==
The basic standard for copyrighted digital font use is that a license is required for each individual font used on a computer, or in the case of businesses, one per entity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |last=Gaultney |first=Victor |url=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=UNESCO_Font_Lic|title=Font Licensing and Protection Details |work=Sil International and UNESCO |date=October 31, 2003 |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the license fonts are typically licensed only for use on one computer. These [[End User License Agreement]]s (EULAs) generally state that fonts may only be used on machines that have a valid license.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; These fonts cannot be shared by multiple computers or given to others. These licenses can be obtained in three ways: directly from the font authors (e.g., [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]), as part of a larger software package (e.g., [[Microsoft Office]]), or through purchasing or downloading the font from an authorized outlet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Such licenses typically only apply to the font file itself (which is a computer program), and not to the shape of the typeface, which may be subject to a design patent.

[[Open-source license|Open-source]] font licenses include the [[GPL font exception|General Public License with the Font Exception]], the [[SIL Open Font License]], and the [[Ubuntu Font License]].

==Lawsuits==
From 1993 to 1995, [[Bitstream Inc.]] and four other type companies successfully sued [[SWFTE]] for copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; SWFTE was using special computer programs to take other type founders' fonts, convert them and give them new names.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The case focused on the fact that SWFTE had used Bitstream's software to create these new fonts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

''[[Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc.]]'' helped clear the distinction between intellectual property protection for a font versus a typeface.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; SSI had used the FontMonger program to copy and rename fonts from Adobe and others.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; They assumed safety from prosecution because, though they had directly copied the points that define the shapes from Adobe's fonts, they had made slight adjustments to all the points so they were not technically identical.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Nevertheless, it was determined that the computer code had been copied.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="adobe_v_ssi_opinion"&gt;''[http://lw.bna.com/lw/19980303/9520710.htm Adobe Systems, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522133154/http://lw.bna.com/lw/19980303/9520710.htm |date=2010-05-22 }}'', No. C 95-20710 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1941 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{date|21 Jan 2016}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/images/ponycomplaint.pdf |format=PDF |title=Font Brothers, Inc., v. Hasbro, Inc. |website=Torrentfreak.com |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; Font Brothers filed a lawsuit against [[Hasbro]], claiming that Hasbro used the “Generation B” font for its [[My Little Pony]] product without permission. Font Brothers claimed that Hasbro had refused to comply with their licensing request. They are also claiming substantial damages, from loss of revenue for this misuse, and requesting a jury trial to resolve this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/my-little-pony-sued-for-using-a-pirated-font-160125/|title="My Little Pony" Sued For Using a Pirated Font - TorrentFreak|work=TorrentFreak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, Berthold LLC sued Target Corporation for its alleged breach of a font license agreement. ''Berthold LLC v. Target Corp.'', No. 1:17-cv-07180 (N.D. Ill.). Target recognized the distinction between a font and a typeface, and what is protectable under U.S. copyright laws. (See docket entry no. 21).

:''See also [[Voucher]]: an invoice is within the [[European union]] primarily legally defined by the EU VAT directive as an [[accounting]] [[voucher]] (to verify tax and VAT reporting) and secondly as a [[Civil law (common law)]] document.
An '''invoice''', '''bill''' or '''tab''' is a [[commerce|commercial]] document issued by a [[sales|seller]] to a [[buyer]], relating to a sale transaction and indicating the [[product (business)|products]], quantities, and agreed [[price]]s for products or [[Service (economics)|services]] the seller had provided the buyer.

[[Discounts and allowances|Payment terms]] are usually stated on the invoice. These may specify that the buyer has a maximum number of days in which to pay and is sometimes offered a discount if paid before the due date. The buyer could have already paid for the products or services listed on the invoice.

In the rental industry, an invoice must include a specific reference to the duration of the time being billed.{{cn|date=June 2018}} So in addition to quantity, price, and discount, the invoice amount is also based on duration. Generally, each line of a rental invoice will refer to the actual hours, days, weeks, months, etc., being billed.

From the point of view of a seller, an invoice is a ''sales invoice''. From the point of view of a buyer, an invoice is a ''purchase invoice''. The document indicates the buyer and seller, but the term ''invoice'' indicates money is owed ''or'' owing.

===European Union===
====EU VAT union invoice definition====

Within the [[European Union Value Added Tax]] directive,&lt;ref&gt;''Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax''&lt;/ref&gt; Article 226 is a concise definition of invoices within the union member states.

Without prejudice to the particular provisions laid down in this Directive, only the following details are required for VAT purposes on invoices issued pursuant to Articles 220 and 221:

* (1) the date of issue;
* (2) a sequential number, based on one or more series, which uniquely identifies the invoice;
* (3) the [[VAT identification number]] referred to in Article 214 under which the taxable person supplied the goods or services;
* (4) the customer's VAT identification number, as referred to in Article 214, under which the customer received a supply of goods or services in respect of which he is liable for payment of VAT, or received a supply of goods as referred to in Article 138;
* (5) the full name and address of the taxable person and of the customer;
* (6) the quantity and nature of the goods supplied or the extent and nature of the services rendered;
* (7) the date on which the supply of goods or services was made or completed or the date on which the [[payment]] on account referred to in points (4) and (5) of Article 220 was made, in so far as that date can be determined and differs from the date of issue of the invoice;
* (7a) where the VAT becomes chargeable at the time when the payment is received in accordance with Article 66(b) and the right of deduction arises at the time the deductible tax becomes chargeable, the mention ‘[[cash method of accounting|cash accounting]]’;
* (8) the taxable amount per rate or exemption, the unit price exclusive of VAT and any [[discounts]] or [[rebate (marketing)|rebates]] if they are not included in the unit price;
* (9) the VAT rate applied;
* (10) the VAT amount payable, except where a special arrangement is applied under which, in accordance with this Directive, such a detail is excluded;
* (10a) where the customer receiving the supply issues the invoice (instead of the supplier) the mention ‘self-billing’;
* (11) in the case of an [[tax exemption|exemption]], reference to the applicable provision of this Directive, or to the corresponding national provision, or any other reference indicating that the supply of goods or services is exempt;
* (11a) where the customer is liable for the payment of the VAT, the mention ‘reverse charge’;
* (12) in the case of the supply of a new [[means of transport]] made in accordance with the conditions specified in Article 138(1) and (2)(a), the characteristics as identified in point (b) of Article 2(2);
* (13) where the margin scheme for [[travel agent]]s is applied, the mention ‘margin scheme — [[travel agent]]s’;
* (14) where one of the special arrangements applicable to [[second-hand goods]], [[works of art]], collectors’ items and antiques is applied, the mention ‘margin scheme — second-hand goods’; ‘margin scheme — works of art’ or ‘margin scheme — collector’s items and antiques’ respectively;
* (15) where the person liable for payment of VAT is a tax representative for the purposes of Article 204, the ([[VAT identification number]], referred to in Article 214, of that tax representative, together with his full name and address.

====EU VAT union receipt (simple invoice) definition====
Article 226b of the EU VAT Directive is a concise definition of [[receipts]] within the union member states.

As regards simplified invoices issued pursuant to Article 220a and Article 221(1) and (2), Member States shall require at least the following details:

* (a) the date of issue;
* (b) identification of the taxable person supplying the goods or services ([[VAT identification number]]);
* (c) identification of the type of goods or services supplied;
* (d) the VAT amount payable or the information needed to calculate it;
* (e) where the invoice issued is a document or message treated as an invoice pursuant to Article 219, specific and unambiguous reference to that initial invoice and the specific details which are being amended.

They may not require details on invoices other than those referred to in Articles 226, 227 and 230.

===Australian Tax Office Tax invoice definition===

Details about the [[Australian Tax Office]] (ATO) requirements for a tax invoice can be found on their website.&lt;ref&gt;Requirements of tax invoices https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/GST/Issuing-tax-invoices/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How
to set out tax invoices and invoices {{cite web |url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Bus/How-to-set-out-tax-invoices-and-invoices/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209145851/https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Bus/How-to-set-out-tax-invoices-and-invoices/ |archivedate=9 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all GST purposes, a seller must issue a tax invoice to the buyer regardless the sale being in cash or credit. Hence, a tax invoice in Australia serves as an invoice as well as a receipt in the conventional sense. The words 'paid' or 'payable' will differentiate meaning. The tax invoice must contain seven facts as per the GST Tax Law.

==Variations==
There are different types of invoices:

* '''[[Pro forma]]''' invoice — In [[foreign trade]], a ''pro forma'' invoice is a document that states a commitment from the seller to provide specified goods to the buyer at specific prices. It is often used to declare value for [[customs]]. It is not an actual invoice, and thus the seller does not record a ''pro forma'' invoice as an [[accounts receivable|account receivable]] and the buyer does not record a ''pro forma'' invoice as an [[accounts payable|account payable]]. A ''pro forma'' invoice is not issued by the seller until the seller and buyer have agreed to the terms of the [[order (business)|order]]. In a few cases, a ''pro forma'' invoice is issued to request advance payments from the buyer, either to allow production to start or for security of the goods produced.
* '''[[Credit memo]]''' - If the buyer returns the goods, the seller usually issues a credit memo for the same or lower amount than the invoice, and then refunds the money to the buyer, or the buyer can apply that credit memo to another invoice.
* '''[[Commercial invoice]]''' - a [[customs declaration]] form used in international trade that describes the parties involved in the shipping transaction, the goods being transported, and the value of the goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhl.com/en/express/shipping/customs_support/customs_paperwork.html DHL | Global | Customs Paperwork&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417111615/http://www.dhl.com/en/express/shipping/customs_support/customs_paperwork.html |date=17 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the primary document used by customs, and must meet specific customs requirements, such as the [[Harmonized System]] number and the country of manufacture. It is used to calculate [[tariff]]s.
* '''Debit memo''' - When a company fails to pay or short-pays an invoice, it is common practice to issue a ''debit memo'' for the [[Balance (accounting)|balance]] and any late fees owed. In function, debit memos are identical to invoices.
* '''Self-billing invoice''' - A ''self billing invoice'' is used when a buyer issues the invoice to themselves (e.g. according to the consumption levels he is taking out of a [[vendor-managed inventory]] stock).&lt;ref&gt;ControlPay, [https://www.controlpay.com/services/freight-audit-solutions Self-billing], accessed 26 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The buyer (i.e. the issuer) should treat the invoice as an account payable and the seller should treat it as an account receivable. If there is tax on the sale, e.g. VAT or GST, then the buyer and seller may need to adjust their tax accounts in accordance with tax legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=HMRC|title=Self-billing and VAT|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/managing/charging/self-billing.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 224 of the EU VAT Directive, self-billing processes may only be used "if there is a prior agreement between the two parties and provided that a procedure exists for the acceptance of each invoice" by the supplier.&lt;ref&gt;Consolidated VAT Directive, 2006, Article 224&lt;/ref&gt; A Self-Billing Agreement will usually provide for the supplier NOT to issue their own sales invoices as well. For further information on UK tax requirements for self-billing see HMRC's [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/self-billing-notice-70062 Notice 700/62 - Self-billing)].
* '''Evaluated receipt settlement (ERS)''' - ERS is a process of paying for goods and services from a [[packing slip]] rather than from a separate invoice document. The payee uses data in the packing slip to apply for the payments. "In an ERS transaction, the supplier ships goods based upon an Advance Shipping Notice (ASN), and the purchaser, upon [[receipt]], confirms the existence of a corresponding purchase order or contract, verifies the identity and quantity of the goods, and then pays the supplier."&lt;ref&gt;[http://scm.ncsu.edu/public/facts/facs041014.html SCM | What is Evaluated Receipt Settlement?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Timesheet''' - Invoices for hourly services issued by businesses such as [[lawyer]]s and [[consultant]]s often pull data from a [[Wiktionary:timesheet|timesheet]]. A timesheet invoice may also be generated by [[Operated equipment rental|Operated equipment rental companies]] where the invoice will be a combination of timesheet based charges and equipment rental charges.
* '''Statement''' - A periodic customer statement includes opening balance, invoices, payments, credit memos, debit memos, and ending balance for the customer's account during a specified period. A monthly statement can be used as a summary invoice to request a single payment for accrued monthly charges.
* '''Progress billing''' used to obtain partial payment on extended contracts, particularly in the construction industry (see [[Schedule of values]])
* '''Collective Invoicing''' is also known as monthly invoicing in [[Japan]]. Japanese businesses tend to have many orders with small amounts because of the outsourcing system ([[Keiretsu]]), or of demands for less inventory control ([[Kanban]]). To save the administration work, invoicing is normally processed on monthly basis.
*'''Continuation or Recurring Invoicing''' is standard within the equipment rental industry, including tool rental. A recurring invoice is one generated on a cyclical basis during the lifetime of a rental contract. For example, if you rent an excavator from 1 January to 15 April, on a calendar monthly arrears billing cycle, you would expect to receive an invoice at the end of January, another at the end of February, another at the end of March and a final Off-rent invoice would be generated at the point when the asset is returned. The same principle would be adopted if you were invoiced in advance, or if you were invoiced on a specific day of the month.
*'''Electronic Invoicing''' is not necessarily the same as EDI invoicing. Electronic invoicing in its widest sense embraces EDI as well as XML invoice messages as well as other formats such as pdf. Historically, other formats such as pdf were not included in the wider definition of an electronic invoice because they were not machine readable and the process benefits of an electronic message could not be achieved. However, as data extraction techniques have evolved and as environmental concerns have begun to dominate the business case for the implementation of electronic invoicing, other formats are now incorporated into the wider definition.

==Electronic==
Some invoices are no longer paper-based, but rather transmitted electronically over the Internet. It is still common for electronic remittance or invoicing to be printed in order to maintain paper records. Standards for electronic invoicing vary widely from country to country. [[Electronic Data Interchange]] (EDI) standards such as the United Nation's [[EDIFACT]] standard include message encoding guidelines for electronic invoices. The [[EDIFACT]] is followed up in the [[UN/CEFACT]] [[ebXML]] syntax cross industry invoice.

===EDIFACT===
The United Nations standard for electronic invoices ("INVOIC") includes standard codes for transmitting header information (common to the entire invoice) and codes for transmitting details for each of the line items (products or services). The "INVOIC" standard can also be used to transmit credit and debit memos.

In the European Union legislation was passed in 2010 in the form of directive 2010/45/EU to facilitate the growth of Electronic Invoicing across all its member states. This legislation caters for varying VAT and inter-country invoicing requirements within the EU, in addition to legislating for the authenticity and integrity of invoices being sent electronically. It is estimated that in 2011 alone roughly 5 million EU businesses will have sent Electronic Invoices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softco.ie/solutions/electronic_invoicing.asp?s=D05A&amp;m=SoftCo.com- The European Electronic Invoicing Experts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111050617/http://www.softco.ie/solutions/electronic_invoicing.asp?s=D05A&amp;m=SoftCo.com- |date=11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open Application Group Integration Specification (OAGIS) from OAGi===
The [[XML]] message format for electronic invoices has been used since the inception of XML in 1998. Open Application Group Integration Specification (OAGIS) has included an invoice since 2001. [http://www.oagi.org/dnn2/ OAGi (Open Applications Group)] has a working relationship with UN/CEFACT where OAGi and its members participate in defining many of the Technology and Methodology specifications. OAGi also includes support for these Technology and Methodology specifications within OAGIS.

===UBL===
The [[XML]] message format for electronic invoices has been used in recent years. There are two standards currently being developed. One is the cross industry invoice under development by the United Nations standards body [[UN/CEFACT]] and the other is [[Universal Business Language|UBL (Universal Business Language)]] which is issued by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards)]]. Implementations of invoices based on UBL are common, most importantly in the public sector in [[Denmark]] as it was the first country where UBL is mandated by law for all the invoices of the public sector. Further implementations are underway in the Scandinavian countries as result of the [[Universal Business Language|NES (North European Subset) project]]. Implementations are also underway in [[Italy]], [[Spain]], the [[Netherlands]] (UBL 2.0)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/digitale-overheid/elektronisch-factureren|title=Elektronisch factureren|publisher=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl|language=Dutch|accessdate=5 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122221456/http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/digitale-overheid/elektronisch-factureren|archivedate=22 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the [[European Commission]] itself.

The NES work has been transferred to [[European Committee for Standardisation|CEN (European Committee for Standardization)]], (the standards body of the European Union) workshop CEN/BII, for public procurement in Europe. The result of that work is a pre-condition for PEPPOL, pan European pilots for public procurement, financed by the European Commission. There UBL procurement documents will be implemented in cross-border pilots between European countries.

Agreement has been made between UBL and UN/CEFACT for convergence of the two XML messages standards with the objective of merging the two standards into one before end of 2009 including the provision of an upgrade path for implementations started in either standard.

===ISDOC===
[http://www.isdoc.org/ ISDOC] is a standard that was developed in the Czech Republic as a universal format for electronic invoices. On 16 October 2008, 14 companies and the Czech government signed a declaration to use this format within one year in their products.

==Payment==
Organizations purchasing goods and services usually have a process in place for approving payment of invoices based on an employee's confirmation that the goods or services have been received.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invoicetemplate.ca/MDO_BTP_Invoice_flowchart_123954_7.pdf Michigan state Bureau of Transportation Invoice processing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://privacy.navy.mil/noticenumber/N07240-1.asp US Department of the Navy Commercial Invoice Payments History System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703144851/http://privacy.navy.mil/noticenumber/N07240-1.asp |date=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://guidebook.dcma.mil/18/commer.htm Commercial Contracting Guidelines - US Defense Contract Management Agency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626102249/http://guidebook.dcma.mil/18/commer.htm |date=26 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acquisition.gov/bestpractices/bestpcont.html US Office of Federal Procurement Policy - Best Practices for Contract Administration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612211853/http://www.acquisition.gov/bestpractices/bestpcont.html |date=12 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, when paying an invoice, a [[remittance advice]] will be sent to the supplier to inform them their invoice has been paid.

==Standardisation==
Invoices are different from [[receipts]]. Both invoices and receipts are ways of tracking purchases of goods and services. In general the content of the invoices can be similar to that of receipts including tracking the amount of the sale, calculating sales tax owed and calculating any discounts applied to the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workingpoint.com/help/en/searchable/WorkingPoint_Help.htm |title=WorkingPoint Help |publisher=Workingpoint.com |accessdate=2013-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819082014/http://www.workingpoint.com/help/en/searchable/WorkingPoint_Help.htm |archivedate=19 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Invoices differ from receipts in that invoices serve to notify customers of payments owed, whereas receipts serve as proof of completed payment.

==Invoice finance==
Invoice finance is effectively a line of credit for a business that is secured on the business's portfolio of invoices.

There are several benefits in terms of choosing invoice financing for your business:
* Lower cost
* Flexibility
* Confidentiality

'''Jamieson Robert Forrest Bennett''' (commonly known as '''Jamie Bennett''') is a business [[entrepreneur]] from [[Aberdeen]], Scotland.

Jamie was born in December 1971 and grew up in [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] where he attended [[Turriff Academy]] before going onto study Engineering at the [[University of Aberdeen]], graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering (honours).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} 

Having harboured his dream to be a businessman since childhood, he started his first venture Atlas Interactive Limited, an oil and gas technology business at the age of just 23. Atlas pioneered the use of [[e-learning]] within the oil and gas industry and became one of the largest providers of online learning programmes internationally, with hundreds of thousands of users across 35 countries. The company created a diagnostic safety [[e-learning]] programme "Minimum Industry Safety Training" (MIST) which is used by most personnel working in the UK offshore oil and gas sector. Bennett sold Atlas in 2007 in a multi-million-pound deal and left the business in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1470642?UserKey=/ |work=[[The Press and Journal (Scotland)|The Press and Journal]] |title=Atlas founder moves on to explore new ventures |date=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing Enerco Group, an entrepreneurial investment company focused on oil and gas technology businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epmag.com/article/print/83659 |title=Former Atlas Interactive CEO Launches Entrepreneurial Investment Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 2010 onwards, Enerco Group has created and invested in a number of oil and gas related companies including Operational Excellence (OPEX) Group Ltd, Mintra Training Portal Ltd and Mintra Training Portal A.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marinelink.com/news/opportunity-growth-opex339497.aspx |title=OPEX Sees Opportunity for Growth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scandoil.com/moxie-bm2/news/enerco-venture-invests-in-mintra.shtml |title=Enerco Venture invests in Mintra}}&lt;/ref&gt;Mintra was sold for an undisclosed figure in December 2014 to a private equity firm at which time Enerco Group held a major interest. Within this period Enerco Group invested £3 million in the redevelopment of an office complex in the west end of Aberdeen to accommodate its growing companies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/energyvoice/oilandgas/33395/enerco-set-for-3million-new-office-complex/ "Enerco set for £3million new office complex]" Energy Voice 2013
&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamie is currently Chairman and CEO of OPEX Group. Opex works with oil and gas operating companies to reduce lifting costs using a powerful combination of predictive technologies, data science and multi-discipline oil and gas expertise.  OPEX's predictive Analysis Service X-PAS, provides data-driven insights which enable customers to eliminate production loss, cut maintenance costs and improve safety.  OPEX recently won the Oil and Gas UK award for Business Innovation and have been shortlisted for several other awards including the global Energy Institute Awards.  In his spare time Jamie is involved in numerous businesses, largely in the oil and gas space.

Renowned for his entrepreneurialism, Jamie strives to help young aspiring business owners on the path to success by mentoring, challenging and sharing his expertise and knowledge.  This was recognised in 2018 when he was the inaugural winner of the Elevator 'Inspirational Mentor of the Year' award.  He is actively involved in supporting the local community through his work with the charity Denis Law Legacy Trust, Streetsport.  The charity aims to reduce instances of youth crime and anti-social behaviors through sport and is currently engaged with over 8,000 participants across a range of age groups to contribute to healthier and safer communities.

Out with work Jamie is passionate about cars but can often be found in a boiler suit driving a tractor on the family farm.

[[Burmese name#Honorifics|U]] '''Kyaw Myint''' ({{lang-my|ကျော်မြင့်}};born c. 1945) also known as '''May Flower Kyaw Win''' is a noted [[Burma|Burmese]] businessman and political figure. He is one of the wealthiest tycoons in Burma and is one of the country's leading industrialists and bankers.&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/print_article.php?art_id=1924|title=Burmese Tycoons Part II|publisher=[[The Irrawaddy]]|date=July 2000|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the director-general of the Directorate of Industry under the Ministry of Industry of Burma.

==Biography==
He was born into a poor [[Burmese Chinese|Chinese]] family in a small village in northern [[Shan State]]. However, in 1968, when he was in his 20s, Kyaw Win worked in the border town of [[Tachilek]], where he established business relationships with Thai businessmen. One of them was the notorious Thai logging tycoon, [[Choon Tangkakarn]], owner of [[Pathumthani Sawmills]].&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt;

Since 1990, Kyaw Win has managed in the timber business and in 1994, he established [[Myanmar May Flower Bank]], the third biggest in Burma with ten branches of which he is the chairman.&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt; It was the first bank in Burma to have 24-hour automatic teller machines also was the first to introduce computer networks for transactions back in November 1995.&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt; In 1998, Aik Hok and Win Naing bought a large number of shares in May Flower Bank from Kyaw Win, and since then the bank’s activities have declined.&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt;

Kyaw Win is also involved in the following associations and businesses. He is Managing Director of Chin-Su Co, Ltd; Chairman of Chin-Su May Flower Plywood Industry; Chairman of TN Resources Pte Co, Ltd (Singapore); Chairman, of Pathum Thani Saw Mill Co, Ltd, (Thailand); and Managing Director of [[Yangon Airways]].&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt; He has connections with the [[Asian Development Bank]] and important top ranking government officials, including General [[Maung Aye]].&lt;ref name="Irrawaddy"/&gt;

In 2004 he negotiated the building of a series of new pulp factories across several states of Burma including in [[Ponnagyun]] in [[Rakhine State]] which will consume nearly 900,000 tonnes of bamboo a year, and [[Thabaung]] township in [[Ayeyarwady Division]] which will begin commercial production at 200 tonnes a year and several other areas. The decision was part of a bilateral cooperation plan between the Ministry of Industry in Burma and [[China Metallurgical Construction Corporation]] signed during the visit of General [[Khin Nyunt]], to China from July 11 to 17 in which U Kyaw Myint was also a member of the delegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no229/MyanmarTimes12-229/015.htm|title=Factories boost pulp production|publisher=[[The Myanmar Times]]|date=March 2004|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to Opium Production==
Kyaw Myint is allegedly the head of the Chinese-staffed and Burma Army-supported People Militia Force (Bi Thu Sit or Ta Ka Sa Pha), an organization that oversees the production and trafficking of opium and heroin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freeburmarangers.org/2014/03/17/opium-logging-and-gas-the-burma-armys-predatory-rule-over-the-people-of-burma/&lt;/ref&gt;  Myint is behind the rise in opium production in Myanmar's Shan State since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.irrawaddy.org/print_article.php?art_id=22322&lt;/ref&gt;

While licensed production provides stimulus to the production and technical capabilities of local industry, in many cases it remains at least partly dependent on foreign support.&lt;ref name=Bitzinger/&gt;

During the 1920s, European economists began advocating licensed production of foreign goods as the cure for "industrial particularism"&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;&amp;mdash;it allowed countries to bypass the costly [[research and development]] stage of acquiring products with which their own industries were unfamiliar, and refocus on the domestic manufacture of preexisting overseas designs.&lt;ref name="UKArms"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Croft|first1=Stuart|last2=Dorman|first2=Andrew|last3=Rees|first3=Wyn|last4=Uttley|first4=Matthew|title=Britain and Defence 1945-2000: A Policy Re-evaluation|date=2001|pages=118-120|publisher=Routledge Books|location=Abingdon-on-Thames|isbn=978-0582303775}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for a much higher rate of production,&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; and was considerably cheaper than national sourcing and off-the-shelf acquisition.&lt;ref name="UKArms"/&gt; European automobile manufacturers were the first to adopt this practice, producing a number of specialized American components for their passenger cars under license.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; The United States not only supplied European factories with the necessary blueprints and licenses, but also sourced American-made tooling equipment accordingly, which allowed the automobile companies to optimize their production lines.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; By the 1960s it was not uncommon for an entire specialized industry&amp;mdash;such as the manufacture of helicopters in the [[United Kingdom]]&amp;mdash;to be dependent wholly on licensed components.&lt;ref name="UKArms"/&gt; 

A number of countries began improving products manufactured under license, and were even able to re-export them successfully.&lt;ref name="Landgren"&gt;{{cite book | first = Signe | last = Landgren| authorlink = | title = Embargo Disimplemented: South Africa's Military Industry|edition= 1989|pages= 83–88 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn= 978-0-19-829127-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend resulted in some technology suppliers imposing additional conditions on the licensee.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The United States began inserting ''pro forma'' statements into licensing agreements known as ''"side letters"'', which required the free sharing of any improvements made to American technology.&lt;ref name=Lorell&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorell|first=Mark|title=Troubled Partnership: A History of U.S.-Japan Collaboration on the Fs-X Fighter|date=2009|pages=27-28|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick|isbn=1-56000-891-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attempts were also made to control the destination of licensed products, particularly with regards to the [[arms industry]].&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;  For instance, [[France]] stipulated that [[Eland Mk7|Eland]] armoured vehicles manufactured in [[South Africa]] under a French license were not to be exported to other foreign powers without its express approval.&lt;ref name="Portugal-ZA"&gt;{{cite paper

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another form of common licensing restriction related solely to the licensing activity, regulating whether the specified product was fully produced or partly assembled, and whether entire products or their individual components were manufactured.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;

In some cases, the original technology supplier did not need to manufacture the product itself&amp;mdash;it merely patented a specific design, then sold the actual production rights to multiple overseas clients.&lt;ref name="Landgren"/&gt; This resulted in some countries producing separate but nearly identical products under different licenses.&lt;ref name="Landgren"/&gt; 

[[Developing nations]] began accounting for a significant percentage of licensed production during the late twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; Governments of developing nations often sought to encourage rapid industrialization, reduce dependence on foreign imports, and combat high levels of unemployment by creating and retaining local jobs.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; However, indigenous companies were often too small and their research capacity too limited to meet these goals alone, compelling them to adopt licensing agreements.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; Manufacturing non-national products under license generated employment and empowered the industry while reducing dependence on imports.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; It also avoided the risks inherent in the development of new products without adequate research infrastructure by taking advantage of consumer goods already proven in foreign markets.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; Several developing nations such as [[Pakistan]] and [[Singapore]] which built important segments of their industry on licensed production have now become licensors themselves to less developed states.&lt;ref name=Bourne&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourne|first=Mike|title=Arming Conflict: The Proliferation of Small Arms|date=2007|pages=66-67|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0230019331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==
[[File:MHV Polski-Fiat 508 1933 01.JPG|thumb|left|220px|1933 [[Fiat 508]] manufactured under license in [[Poland]] by [[Polski Fiat]].]]
Licensed production is defined as an overseas production arrangement, usually as a direct result of inter-state trade agreements, that permits a foreign government or entity to acquire the technical information to manufacture all or part of an equipment or component patented in the exporting country.&lt;ref name=Seyoum/&gt; According to the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), it must constitute a partnership between an [[intellectual property]] owner and a licensee who is authorized to use such rights under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The licensee is manufacturing a product for which it has been granted production rights under specific conditions, while the licensor retains ownership of the intellectual property thereof.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; In some cases the licensor will supply the necessary technical data, prototypes, and/or machine tools to the licensee.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;

While licensed production is often dependent on the appropriate [[technology transfers]], it does not necessarily entail ownership and management of the overseas production by the technology supplier.&lt;ref name=Seyoum/&gt; However, the licensor does retain the right to continue to use the licensed property, and to attribute further licenses to third parties.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; Occasionally, licensees may themselves sub-license a third party with or without the agreement of the intellectual property owner.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;  

Licensing agreements determine the form and scope of compensation to the intellectual property owner, which usually takes the form of a flat ''licensing fee'' or a running [[royalty payment]] derived from a share of the licensee's revenue.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The licenses can be terminated by the licensor, or may expire after a set date; however, the technology and knowledge, once transferred, cannot be rescinded, so even if the licensing agreement expires they remain in the licensee's possession.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;

Two related commercial practices are foreign subcontractor production and the proliferation of [[knock-down kits]]. Foreign subcontracting occurs when a product's original manufacturer contracts the production of its individual parts and components to a second party overseas.&lt;ref name=Seyoum/&gt; Such arrangements are not considered examples of licensed production because they do not involve the explicit licensing of technological information.&lt;ref name=Seyoum/&gt; Knock-down kits are regarded as a prerequisite to licensed production; they consist of products assembled locally from imported, pre-manufactured parts.&lt;ref name=Bitzinger2&gt;{{cite book|last=Bitzinger|first=Richard|title=Towards a Brave New Arms Industry?|date=2003|pages=17-21|publisher=Routledge Books|location=Abingdon-on-Thames|isbn=978-0198528357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality control and unlicensed production==
{{see also|Counterfeit consumer goods}}
Some licensors find it difficult to regulate the quality of their products manufactured under license.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; It is not always made clear to consumers where exactly a particular good originated, and a poor quality licensed product may damage the reputation of the original licensor.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; However, this is not considered a form of consumer fraud unless the product is unlicensed or [[counterfeit]].&lt;ref name="Ersatz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Counterfeit products|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/tocta/8.Counterfeit_products.pdf|location=New York
|publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]|date=2010|accessdate=20 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223230500/https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/tocta/8.Counterfeit_products.pdf|archivedate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlicensed production is the utilization of foreign manufacturing technology without a license, achieved through [[industrial espionage]] or [[reverse engineering]].&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; Products in high demand on the international market can be reproduced, based on the same or similar design, and branded in ways to make them indistinguishable from the original.&lt;ref name="Ersatz"/&gt; When copied and reproduced without a license, certain items are sometimes recopied in a similar manner by a third party.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The manufacturers responsible may also grant legitimately registered sub-licenses for their unlicensed products, profiting at the expense of the real intellectual property owner.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The quality of unlicensed goods varies greatly; the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] has noted that while licensing companies often provide quality control measures, and there is some incentive for licensees to comply or risk legal action and the ensuing damage to their own profit, manufacturers who engage in unlicensed production are under no such obligations.&lt;ref name="Ersatz"/&gt;

Another method of circumventing the need for a license involves a manufacturer making slight modifications in the design or function of an existing product, before reproducing it.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt; The manufacturer could then argue that the resulting product is not an unlicensed copy, but a new product not subject to license.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;

==OO gauge==

===Locomotives===
Dapol's first OO gauge model to be announced was a BR class 22 Diesel, but this was not the first released. A Sentinel Shunter was commissioned by ''Model Rail'' Magazine, released July 2011, and a Beattie well tank by Kernow Model Shop in September 2011. The class 22 was released in November 2011 closely followed by a Hattons commissioned LMS 10000 diesel model. Since them Dapol have announced an ever increasing range of commissioned and in house models for release over the next few years.

Dapol also produced a [[British Rail Class 390]] model - the 390001 Virgin Pioneer.

There are two versions of the popular wagons. Dapol has recently introduced a collection of wagons with [[Railway coupling#Model trains|NEM couplings]], finer wheels, etc. These are denoted by '[M]'; the m representing 'modern'



====Grouping====
Please note that there are also 4-, 5- and 7-plank wagons, which have appeared not only in company liveries, but also in private owner liveries. Additional company specific wagons are listed below.

;GWR
*Fruit D (also appeared in BR parcels livery)[M]

;SR
*8T Twin Vent van

====BR====
*Grain Hopper

====Modern Era (circa 2000 to present)====
* Intermodal container flats [M]

==O Gauge==

Dapol have released a 7 plank ready to run wagon in O gauge, and have plans to 
release several locomotives and other items of rolling stock. One point to note is they 
are very keenly priced breaking the myth that O gauge ready to run models are very 
expensive.

[[File:Nicolai Benjamin Aall.JPG|thumb|Nicolai Benjamin Aall]]

==Personal life==
Nicolai Benjamin Aall was born in 1739 as the first son of Niels Jacobsen Aall (1702–1784) and Benedicte Henrikke Bergh (1714–1748) from [[Moss, Norway|Moss]]. Niels Jacobsen Aall had been  born in [[London]], but moved to [[Porsgrunn|Porsgrund]] in 1712. Benedicte Henrikke was the second of three wives. Nicolai Benjamin's younger half-brother Jacob Aall, Sr. became a noted wholesaler, whereas his youngest half-sister Benedicte Henrica Aall  married Severin Løvenskiold (1743–1818). Their son, [[Severin Løvenskiold]], was his nephew.&lt;ref name="storgaden155"&gt;[http://www.porsgrunn.folkebibl.no/bok/fck/ep/storgata-155.html Storgaden 155], in ''Eidanger–Porsgrund'', by [[Finn Christian Knudsen|Finn C.

==Career==
Aall graduated from the [[University of Copenhagen]] and took examination as a [[theologian]] in 1759, but later turned to work in his father's business. He acquired burghership as a merchant in 1772.&lt;ref name="tønnessen"/&gt; He bought the sawmill at  [[Ulefoss]] from the Anker family in 1782, having been a co-owner (one eighth part) since 1775. He also bought various real estate. In 1777 he took over two sawmills in [[Skien]] and forested property near the border of  [[Telemark]].

In 1796 he and [[Diderik von Cappelen]], brother of his son-in-law Ulrich Fredrich von Cappelen, established a rope factory (''Reperbane'') at [[Porsgrunn|Vestre Porsgrunn]] to meet the needs of the  shipbuilding industry. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     https://snl.no/Diderik_von_Cappelen |title=   Diderik von Cappelen|publisher =  Store norske leksikon |author=  Knut Dørum|accessdate= August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Mobile Alliance''' ('''OMA''') is a [[standards body]] which develops [[open standard]]s for the [[mobile phone]] industry. It is not a formal government-sponsored standards organization like the [[ITU]], but a forum for industry [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] to agree on common [[specifications]] for products and services.

== Principles ==
; Mission: To provide [[Interoperability|interoperable]] service enablers working across countries, operators and mobile terminals.
; Network-agnostic: The OMA only standardises applicative protocols; OMA specifications are meant to work with any cellular network technologies being used to provide networking and data transport. These networking technology are specified by outside parties.  In particular, OMA specifications for a given function are the same with either [[GSM]], [[UMTS]] or [[CDMA2000]] networks.
; Voluntary adherence: Adherence to the standards is entirely voluntary; the OMA does not have a mandative role. The goal is that by agreeing on common standards, stakeholders will be able to "share slices from a larger pie".
; "[[FRAND]]" intellectual property licensing: OMA members that own [[intellectual property]] rights (e.g. [[patent]]s) on technologies that are essential to the realization of a specification agree in advance to provide [[license]]s to their technology on "fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory" terms to other members.
; Legal status: OMA is incorporated in California, USA.

==History==
The OMA was created in June 2002 as an answer to the proliferation of [[industry forum]]s each dealing with a few application protocols: WAP Forum (focused on browsing and device provisioning protocols), the [[Wireless Village]] (focused on instant messaging and presence), [[The SyncML Initiative]] (focused on data synchronization), the [[Location Interoperability Forum]], the [[Mobile Games Interoperability Forum]] and the [[Mobile Wireless Internet Forum]]. Each of these forums had its bylaws, its decision-taking procedures, its release schedules, and in some instances there was some overlap in the specifications, causing duplication of work. The OMA was created to gather these initiatives under a single umbrella.

Members include traditional wireless industry players such as equipment and mobile systems manufacturers ([[Ericsson]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], [[Huawei]], [[ZTE]], [[Reti Radiotelevisive Digitali]], [[Nokia]], [[Openwave]], [[Sony]], [[Philips]], [[Motorola]], [[Samsung]], [[LG Electronics]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[Qualcomm]]) and mobile operators ([[Vodafone]], [[Orange SA|Orange]], [[T-Mobile]], [[LG Telecom]]), and also software vendors ([[Microsoft]], [https://www.friendly-tech.com Friendly Technologies], Gemalto, Telit Communications, Red Bend Software and others).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://openmobilealliance.org/membership/current-members|title=Current Members|website=openmobilealliance.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to other standards bodies ==

The OMA liaises with other standards bodies on a regular basis to avoid overlap in specifications:
* [[3GPP]]
* [[3rd Generation Partnership Project 2|3GPP2]]
* [[IETF]]
* [[W3C]]

== Standard specifications ==
The OMA maintains a number of specifications, including
* Browsing specifications, now called "Browser and Content", previously called [[WAP browsing]]. In their current version, these specifications rely essentially on [[XHTML Mobile Profile]].
* [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] specifications for multimedia messaging
* [[OMA DRM]] specifications for [[Digital Rights Management]]
* [[OMA Instant Messaging and Presence Service]] (OMA IMPS) specification, which is a system for instant messaging on mobile phones (formerly known as [[Wireless Village]]).
* [[OMA SIMPLE IM]] Instant messaging based on SIP-SIMPLE (see [[Session Initiation Protocol]])
* OMA CAB Converged Address Book, a social address book service standard.
* OMA CPM Converged IP Messaging, the underlying enabler for [[Rich Communication Services]].
* [[OMA LAWMO]] (OMA LAWMO) Specifications for Lock and Wipe functionality [[LAWMO]].
* [[OMA LWM2M]] (OMA LWM2M) Specifications for Lightweight Machine to Machine functionality.
* [[OMA Client Provisioning]] (OMA CP) specification for Client [[Provisioning]].
* [[OMA Data Synchronization]] (OMA DS) specification for [[Data Synchronization]] using [[SyncML]].
* [[OMA Device Management]] (OMA DM) specification for [[Device Management]] using [[SyncML]].
* [[OMA BCAST]] specification for Mobile Broadcast Services.
* [[Rich Media Environment|OMA RME]] specification for Rich Media Environment.
* [[OMA OpenCMAPI]] Connection Management APIs&lt;ref&gt;[http://openmobilealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Presentation-of-OMA-Open-CM-API.pdf Slides] Slides&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[OMA PoC]] specification for [[Push to talk]] Over Cellular (called "PoC").
* [[OMA Presence SIMPLE]] specification for Presence based on SIP-SIMPLE (see [[Session Initiation Protocol]]).
* [[OMA Service Environment]]
* [[FUMO]] Firmware update
* [[Assisted GPS#Standards|SUPL]], Secure User Plane Location Protocol,&lt;ref name="UPL3.0"&gt;{{cite news|title=User Plane Location Protocol v3.0|url=http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/SUPL/V3_0-20110920-C/OMA-TS-ULP-V3_0-20110920-C.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2017|publisher=OMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; an IP-based service for [[assisted GPS]] on handsets
* [[Mobile Location Protocol|MLP]], an IP-based protocol for obtaining the position/location of mobile handset

'''Organization and Methods''' is a historical term in management science. Divisions of Organization and Methods were charged with devising and managing large scale administrative procedures. The term is notable in that it was the large O &amp; M organizations in areas such as insurance and government which pioneered the commercial use of electronic computers in what became [[Data Processing]], later [[Information Systems]] and [[Information Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Akera, Atsushi (2007).

Oumarou Fadil went to University of San Diego where he got a master's degree in International Business. 
Two ways then opened to him: whether he would become a trader at Wall Street or come back to Cameroon. He chose the latter and joined the Fadil Group. He first occupied the post of Administrative and financial Manager at the Complexe Chimique Camerounais a Central Africa sub-regional, a pioneer in agro-industry, and later the post of General Manager of Complexe Chimique Camerounais. As the Vice president of the Fadil Group he has taken an active part in the development of the said Group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13046">A '''polytechnic''' ({{Lang-cy|coleg polytechnig}}&lt;ref&gt;http://m.cy.caimeiprinter.com/info/polytechnic-museum-of-printing-621616.html&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[tertiary education]] teaching institution in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] offering higher diplomas, undergraduate degree and post graduate education (masters and PhDs) that was governed and administered at the national level by the [[Council for National Academic Awards]]. At the outset the focus of Polytechnics was on [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects with a special emphasis on [[engineering]].  After the passage of the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] they became independent [[university|universities]] which meant they could award their own degrees. The comparable institutions in [[Scotland]] were collectively referred to as [[Central Institution]]s. Like polytechnics or technological universities ([[institute of technology]]) in other countries, their aim was to teach both purely academic and professional vocational degrees (engineering, computer science, law, architecture, management, business, accounting, journalism, town planning) etc. Their original focus was applied education for professional work and their original roots concentrated on advanced engineering and applied science ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects), though soon after being founded they also created departments concerned with the humanities. The polytechnic legacy was to advance and excel in undergraduate and post graduate degrees in engineering and technology (STEM) education that now form a core faculty at most universities in the UK. While many former polytechnics have advanced their research focus many have stayed true to their original ethos by focusing on teaching for professional practice.

The division between universities and polytechnics was known as the [[Binary Divide]] in UK higher education.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
Some polytechnics trace their history back to the early 19th century. The [[University of Westminster|London Polytechnic]] (now the [[University of Westminster]]) emerged from the Royal Polytechnic Institution which was founded at Regent Street, London in 1838. The establishment of the polytechnic was a reaction to the rise of industrial power and technical education in France, Germany and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Brosan, "The Development of Polytechnics in the UK", ''Paedagogica Europaea'', Vol 7, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Degrees at the London Polytechnic were validated by the University of London. The first British institution to use the name "polytechnic" was the [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]], which it still retains, together with the affectionate nickname "The Poly".

=== 1960s–1992 ===
Most polytechnics were formed in the expansion of higher education in the 1960s, [[Academic degree]]s in polytechnics were validated by the UK [[Council for National Academic Awards]] (CNAA) from 1965 to 1992. The CNAA was chartered by the British government to validate and award degrees and maintain national quality assurance standards. The CNAA subject boards from their inception were from the universities. A CNAA degree was formally recognised as equivalent to a university degree and the courses were under strict scrutiny by assessors external to the polytechnics.&lt;ref name="DAvis1979"&gt;{{cite paper|title=The council for national academic awards 1964-74: a study of a validating agency|author=Davis, Martin C.|date=1979|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/7924/3/Thesis-1979-Davis.pdf|publisher=Loughborough University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub-degree courses at these institutions were validated by the Business &amp; Technology Education Council ([[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]]).

Some polytechnics were often seen as ranking below universities in the provision of higher education because they lacked degree-awarding powers, concentrated on applied science and engineering education and produced less research than the universities, and because the qualifications necessary to gain a place in one were sometimes lower than for a university (the failure rate in the first year of undergraduate courses was high due to a rigorous filtering process). However, in terms of an undergraduate education this was a misconception since many polytechnics offered academic degrees validated by the CNAA from bachelor's and master's degree to PhD research degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Harold: "Higher Education in the UK: A critical examination of the Role of the CNAA", ''Higher Education Journal'', Springer Netherlands, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Also professional degrees in, for instance, engineering, town planning, law, and architecture were rigorously validated by various professional institutions. Many polytechnics argued that a CNAA degree was superior to many university degrees especially in engineering, due to the external independent validation process employed by the CNAA, the oversight of the engineering institutions, and innovations such as [[sandwich degree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/apr/04/theobserver.observerbusiness4|title=Design's angel of the North|date=2004-04-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such innovations made a polytechnic education more relevant for professional work in applying science and advanced technology in industry.&lt;ref&gt;Brosan, "The Development of Polytechnics in the UK", ''Paedagogica Europaea'', Vol 7, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://technicaleducationmatters.org/about/|title=About|website=technicaleducationmatters.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In UK culture an engineering, applied science and technological education tended to be looked down upon socially. Industries and activities such as "manufacturing" and "engineering" were perceived to be things of the past, boring and "dirty". This connection to polytechnics did not help their cause in terms of achieving status in the public eye. This attitude and influence led to an expansion of the more popular subjects in the "creative" industries such as fashion, arts and design, media studies, journalism, film studies, and sports management. This social influence caused many polytechnics to change their faculty of "Engineering" to faculty of "Design and Technology"

For many years a central admissions system for polytechnics was not seen as necessary. However, a large increase in applications resulted from funding cuts to universities in the early 1980s. The [[Polytechnics Central Admissions System]] was introduced and handled the years of entry from 1986 to 1992.

===Post-1992===
Under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] they became fully fledged universities. After 1992, the former polytechnics ("[[new universities]]") awarded their own degrees. Most sub-degree BTEC qualifications have been phased out of the new universities and transferred to colleges of further education.

The polytechnics changed their names when they gained university status. Some simply dropped "polytechnic" and added "university" to their titles. For example, the Huddersfield Polytechnic became the University of Huddersfield. However, this was often not possible as there was another university with the name. One alternative title was "Metropolitan University", because the institution was situated in a city or other large [[metropolitan area]]. Examples are [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] and [[London Metropolitan University]]. These titles are often shortened to "Met" (Man Met, London Met) or an [[acronym]] (MMU, LMU). Others adopted a name which reflects the local area, such as [[Nottingham Trent University]] (named after the River Trent which flows through Nottingham) and [[Sheffield Hallam University]] ("Hallam" refers to the area of South Yorkshire in which much of Sheffield is situated). [[Ulster Polytechnic]] remains the only polytechnic to unite with a university; this occurred in 1984.

The last degree-awarding institution to hold on to the name "polytechnic" after 1992 was Anglia Polytechnic University (which had only attained polytechnic status the previous year). The word was soon identified as being off-putting to potential students, and the university became known as [[Anglia Ruskin University]] from 2005. The name "polytechnic" ([[École Polytechnique]]) in continental Europe and the USA ([[MIT]]) are viewed and styled as globally elite universities specializing in STEM education where science, engineering and engineers are premier forward looking strategic professions.  This is in stark contrast to the culture and social identity of engineers in the UK.

==List of former polytechnics==
At their peak there were over thirty polytechnics in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the English ones being primarily located in urban areas large enough to support industry or commerce, from which they usually took the city name. 
These are now universities.

In England, there are:
*[[Anglia Ruskin University]], formerly Anglia Polytechnic (located in Cambridge and Chelmsford)
*[[Birmingham City University]], formerly [[Birmingham Polytechnic]]
*[[University of Brighton]], formerly Brighton Polytechnic
*[[Bournemouth University]], formerly Bournemouth Polytechnic
*[[University of Central Lancashire]], formerly Lancashire Polytechnic and before that Preston Polytechnic (until 1984)
*[[Coventry University]], formerly Coventry Polytechnic and Lanchester Polytechnic (until 1987)
*[[De Montfort University]] Leicester, formerly Leicester Polytechnic
*[[University of East London]], formerly North East London Polytechnic and Polytechnic of East London
*[[University of Greenwich]], formerly Woolwich Polytechnic (later Thames Polytechnic)
*[[University of Hertfordshire]], formerly Hatfield Polytechnic
*[[University of Huddersfield]], formerly Huddersfield Polytechnic
*[[Kingston University]], formerly Kingston Polytechnic
*[[Leeds Beckett University]], formerly Leeds Polytechnic and as Leeds Metropolitan University from 1998 to 2013
*[[University of Lincoln|Lincoln University]] was formed in part from Humberside Polytechnic which was briefly Humberside University
*[[Liverpool John Moores University]], formerly Liverpool Polytechnic
*[[London Metropolitan University]], formerly [[London Guildhall University|City of London Polytechnic]] and [[University of North London|Polytechnic of North London]]
*[[Manchester Metropolitan University]], formerly Manchester Polytechnic
*[[Middlesex University]], formerly Middlesex Polytechnic
*[[University of Northumbria at Newcastle]], formerly Newcastle Polytechnic
*[[Nottingham Trent University]], formerly Trent Polytechnic (later Nottingham Polytechnic)
*[[Oxford Brookes University]], formerly Oxford Polytechnic
*[[University of Plymouth]], Plymouth Polytechnic (until 1989), then Polytechnic South West
*[[University of Portsmouth]], formerly Portsmouth Polytechnic
*[[Sheffield Hallam University]], formerly Sheffield Polytechnic
*[[South Bank University]], formerly South Bank Polytechnic (in London)
*[[Staffordshire University]], formerly Staffordshire Polytechnic
*[[University of Sunderland]], formerly Sunderland Polytechnic
*[[Teesside University]], formerly Teesside Polytechnic
*[[University of the West of England]], formerly Bristol Polytechnic
*[[University of West London]], formerly Polytechnic of West London
*[[University of Westminster]], formerly Polytechnic of Central London and the Royal Polytechnic Institution – Regent Street
*[[University of Wolverhampton]], formerly Wolverhampton Polytechnic


In addition, Wales has
*[[University of South Wales]], formerly Polytechnic of Wales and University of Glamorgan 

and Northern Ireland has:
*[[New University of Ulster]] which was a [[plate glass university]]. It absorbed the former Ulster Polytechnic, afterwards it was known as the University of Ulster. It is now known as [[Ulster University]]

In Scotland there were comparable Higher Education institutions called [[Central Institution]]s but these very rarely used the designation "Polytechnic" in their titles; these also converted into universities.
* One institution that did briefly use the designation "Polytechnic" was [[Edinburgh Napier University]]. Between 1988 and 1992 the institution was known as Napier Polytechnic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edinburgh Napier University|title=About Edinburgh Napier University|url=http://www.napier.ac.uk/aboutus/foi/Pages/AboutEdinburghNapierUniversity.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728015527/http://www.napier.ac.uk/aboutus/foi/Pages/AboutEdinburghNapierUniversity.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 July 2011|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rajiv D. Banker''' (born 1953) is an accounting researcher and educator, recognized by the Institute for Scientific Information ([[Web of Science]]) as one of the 150 most influential researchers in economics and business.&lt;ref name="Rajiv D. Banker"&gt;https://sites.temple.edu/banker/bio/&lt;/ref&gt; He is the Director of the Center for Accounting and Information Technology at the [[Fox School of Business and Management]], [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name="Rajiv D. Banker" /&gt; He is also President of the International Data Envelopment Analysis Society &lt;ref&gt;http://deasociety.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and Editor-in-Chief of the Data Envelopment Analysis Journal.&lt;ref&gt;http://deasociety.org/home/journal&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and early career ==

Banker obtained his Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Bombay in 1973, and his PhD at [[Harvard University]] in 1980.

His early research focused on [[productivity]],&lt;ref&gt;“Productivity Measurement and Management Control,” The Management of Productivity and Technology in Manufacturing, P. Kleindorfer (Ed.), Plenum, New York, NY, (1985), pp. 239-257.&lt;/ref&gt; [[economies of scale]],&lt;ref&gt;“Scale Economies in New Software Development,” with C. Kemerer, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 15, 10, (October 1989), pp. 1199-1205.&lt;/ref&gt; [[operational efficiency]],&lt;ref&gt;“Measuring Gains in Operational Efficiency from Information Technology: A Case Study of the Positran Deployment at Hardee’s, Inc.,” with R. Kauffman and R. Morey, Journal of Management Information Systems, (Fall 1990), pp. 29-54.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[data envelopment analysis]]. His research on data envelopment analysis includes 15 articles co-authored with [[William W. Cooper]] from 1984 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;“Models for Estimating Technical and Scale Inefficiencies in Data Envelopment Analysis,” with A. Charnes and W.W. Cooper, Management Science, 30, 9, (September 1984), pp. 1078-1092.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Returns to Scale in DEA,” with W.W. Cooper, L. Seiford and J. Zhu, in Handbook on Data Envelopment Analysis, W.W. Cooper, L. Seiford and J. Zhu (Eds.), Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA, (2011), pp. 43-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Banker co-authored a textbook called ''Management Accounting'' with Anthony Akinson, [[Robert S. Kaplan]] and Mark Young.&lt;ref&gt;Management Accounting, with A. Atkinson, R. Kaplan and M. Young, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ, First edition (1995). {{ISBN|0131854488}} {{ISBN|9780131854482}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This textbook is now in its third edition. He also co-authored a book on the [[balanced scorecard]].&lt;ref&gt;Balanced Scorecard: Linking Strategy to Performance, with S. Janakiraman and C. Konstans, Financial Executives Research Foundation, Morris Town, NJ (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

From mid 2004 to early 2005, Banker served only a short term as Dean of the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management (AGSM) at the University of California Riverside, during which he spent considerable time in India conducting research, and then later served as a "special assistant" in the chancellor's office after leaving his position as Dean.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Auditor-blasts-UC-s-pay-practices-University-2519099.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/18/local/me-uc18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://newsroom.ucr.edu/656&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==

From 2014 to 2016, Banker's research contributions include 15 articles on [[accounting]], [[information systems]], [[operations management]] and [[management science]]. Many of these articles were published in top journals, such as the [[Journal of Accounting and Economics]] &lt;ref&gt;“The Confounding Effect of Cost Stickiness in Conservatism Research,” with S. Basu, D. Byzalov, and J. Chen, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 61, 1, (2016).,&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Accounting Review]],&lt;ref&gt;“Implications of Impairment Decisions and Assets’ Cash-Flow Horizons for Conservatism Research,” with D. Byzalov and S. Basu, forthcoming in the Accounting Review, (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Demand Uncertainty and Cost Behavior” with D. Byzalov and J. Plehn-Dujowich, The Accounting Review, 89, 3, (May 2014), pp. 839-865.  Winner of the 2015 Notable Contribution to the Accounting Literature Award.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Accounting Horizons]],&lt;ref&gt;"William W. Cooper: Innovator, Fighter and Scholar,” with R.

The '''Silver Line''' is a [[limited-stop]] bus route with some [[bus rapid transit]] features operated by the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (Metro). The Silver Line route runs between the [[El Monte Bus Station (Los Angeles Metro station)|El Monte Station]], [[Downtown Los Angeles]],  [[South Los Angeles]], the [[Harbor Gateway Transit Center]] in [[Gardena, California|Gardena]] and [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]].

The Silver Line offers frequent, all-stops service along the [[El Monte Busway]] and the [[Harbor Transitway]], two grade-separated transit facilities built into the Los Angeles freeway system. The Silver Line was created as part of the conversion of the El Monte Busway and the Harbor Transitway from lanes reserved for buses and [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|high occupancy vehicles]] into the [[Metro ExpressLanes]] that allow solo drivers to pay a toll to use lanes. The tolls collected have been used to operate the Silver Line and to improve amenities at stops.

As Silver Line buses travel along the El Monte Busway and the Harbor Transitway they serve stations built into the center or side of the roadway. There is a 3.5 mile gap between the western end of El Monte Busway and the northern end of the Harbor Transitway in Downtown Los Angeles, where Silver Line buses travel on surface streets, making a limited number of stops.

==Service description==
Two services are operated under the Silver Line name:
* '''Route 910''' operates with daily 24-hour service serving only the portion of the route between El Monte station, Downtown Los Angeles and the Harbor Gateway Transit Center.
* '''Route 950''' operates with daily service serving the entire route between El Monte station, Downtown Los Angeles and San Pedro.

=== Routing ===
The eastern section of Silver Line route runs on the [[El Monte Busway]] between the [[El Monte Bus Station (LACMTA station)|El Monte Station]] in [[El Monte, California|El Monte]] and [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] in Downtown Los Angeles. The southern section of the route runs on the [[Harbor Transitway]] between [[37th Street/USC]] station in Downtown Los Angeles and the [[Harbor Gateway Transit Center]] near the city of [[Carson, California|Carson]]. Buses travel between the eastern and southern sections along surface streets in Downtown Los Angeles where Silver Line buses make a limited amount of stops (11 in each direction) near major employment centers, tourist destinations and [[Metro Rail (Los Angeles County)|Metro Rail]] stations. Silver Line route 950 trips continue south of the Harbor Gateway Transit Center along the Harbor Freeway to [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] traveling in general purpose freeway lanes and making two stops en route at stations located on the side of the freeway near off and on ramps. In San Pedro, Silver Line route 950 buses once again travel along surface streets, serving the [[Harbor Beacon Park &amp; Ride]] and making frequent stops along Pacific Avenue. 

The Silver Line currently connects to all Metro Rail lines, though it will not connect with the [[Crenshaw/LAX Line]], scheduled to open in 2019.

===Fares===
The Silver Line charges a premium fare (which is a different fare structure from most other Metro routes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesource.metro.net/2009/12/09/guide-to-the-metro-silver-line/|title=Guide to the Metro Silver Line|work=The Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AdHoc38&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metro.net/board/Items/2009/10_October/20091015OPItem38.pdf|title=Line 910 fare structure|date=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metro day passes are accepted as full fare, but all other pass holders must pay for an upgraded 1 zone pass or pay the additional premium charge at the time of boarding.

Like the other Metro Rail and Metro Busway lines, the Silver Line operates on a [[proof-of-payment]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metro.net/projects/silverline/all-door-boarding-pilot/|title=Metro Silver Line {{!}} All-Door Boarding Pilot|website=www.metro.net|publisher=[[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers may board at either the front or rear door of Silver Line buses and validate their [[Transit Access Pass]] (TAP) electronic fare card at readers located on board the bus, near the door. Metro's fare inspectors randomly inspect buses to ensure passengers have a valid fare product on their TAP card. 

TAP vending machines are available at most Silver Line stations (except Carson and Pacific Coast Highway) and are located near most street stops in Downtown Los Angeles. But, because vending machines are not available at all stations and street stops, passengers who need to purchase a card or add funds can do so at the farebox on board the bus. None of the other Metro Rail or Metro Busway lines offer onboard TAP sales.

As of December 15, 2014 the fares for the Silver Line are:

==== "Silver 2 Silver" fare program ====
Metro and Foothill Transit offer a reciprocal fare program called "Silver 2 Silver" where pass holders may ride either Silver Line or Silver Streak buses between Downtown Los Angeles and the El Monte Station.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://foothilltransit.org/lines-and-schedules/silver2silver/&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers who have a Metro 7-Day or 30-Day pass, an EZ transit pass, or a Foothill Transit Local 31-Day pass are all charged additional when they board a Silver Line or Silver Streak bus.

==History==
{{Main|History of Los Angeles Metro Rail and Busway}}

[[File:Harbor Fwy Upper Deck1.jpg|thumb|This elevated section of the Harbor Transitway carries the Metro Silver Line and the [[Metro ExpressLanes]] over the frequently congested Harbor Freeway.]]

The El Monte Busway opened along Interstate 10 in 1973. As the new Harbor Transitway was under construction in the early 1990s, Metro drew up plans to offer a unified bus rapid transit service along both corridors, connected by street running through Downtown Los Angeles; however, eventually the agency chose to increase service on the existing Harbor Freeway express lines and operate each as independent routes, mostly at peak hours. Ridership was radically lower than expected: planners had projected that 65,200 passengers would travel along the Harbor Transitway each day, but after 10 years ridership fell far below those predictions, with the route seeing just 3,000 passengers per weekday in 2004.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/countygovernment/la-me-harbor-busway-20141202-story.html|title=A cleaned-up, safer Harbor Transitway puts more commuters on the bus|last=Weikel|first=Dan|date=December 2, 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=March 9, 2015|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, Metro began depicting the two busways on its Metro Rail maps, and in 2008, Metro once again looked at the concept of linking them with a "Dual Hub Bus Rapid Transit" route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.net/board/Items/2008/11_November/20081119AHCPItem18Handout.pdf|title=Dual Hub Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) El Monte Station to Artesia Transit Center|date=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was rolled out as the Silver Line in December 2009. Five [[Metro Express (Los Angeles County)|Metro Express]] lines were truncated to terminate at either Harbor Gateway Transit Center or the El Monte station, where passengers would transfer to the Silver Line to continue into Downtown Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Feb09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.net/riding_metro/special_services/images/SB910%20Feb09%20public%20hearing.pdf|title=SB910 Feb09 public hearing|date=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As part of the [[Metro ExpressLanes]] project to convert the El Monte Busway and the Harbor Transitway from lanes reserved for buses and [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|high occupancy vehicles]] into high occupancy toll lanes that allow solo drivers to pay a toll to use lanes, aging stations were refurbished and frequencies on the route were improved; the most drastic change was the complete reconstruction of El Monte Station which was demolished and entirely rebuilt, reopening in 2012.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metro.net/board/Items/2012/01_January/20120118OPItem64.pdf|title=Metro Silver Line Update Report |date=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; LADOT added [[bus priority]] to [[traffic lights]] to improve on-time performance in Downtown Los Angeles in the same year.&lt;ref name="silverServicetab"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metro.net/projects/silverline/|title=Metro Silver Line (service tab)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Metro integrated the last remaining Metro Express route on the Harbor Transitway, the 450X to San Pedro, into the Silver Line. Originally a new express Silver Line service was added that served San Pedro and skipped many Harbor Transitway stations; but by June 2017, San Pedro-bound buses were serving all stations, the increase in speed being deemed not enough to justify increased crowding on local buses.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesource.metro.net/2017/06/19/service-changes-go-into-effect-june-25-orange-line-and-silver-line-to-operate-around-the-clock/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current developments==

===New transitway station at Patsaouras Transit Plaza===
A new transitway station for the Metro Silver Line will be located at [[Patsaouras Transit Plaza]] at Union Station to provide better access to bus, Metro Rail, Metrolink and Amtrak services. {{As of|2017|April}} the station is under construction, and is expected to open in the spring of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scpr.org/news/2017/01/02/67692/metro-starts-work-on-pedestrian-bridge-at-la-s-uni/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ridership and reliability==
Ridership has steadily grown on the Silver Line each year.

An estimated 6,612 passengers rode the Silver Line each weekday in January 2010 (the first full month of operation) and ridership has grown steadily each year since.&lt;ref name="Ridership"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isotp.metro.net/MetroRidership/IndexAllBus.aspx|title=Metro Ridership|last=|first=|date=|website=Metro.net|publisher=[[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ridership set a new all-time high in February 2016 with an estimated 16,884 passengers riding the line each weekday.

The on time performance of the Metro Silver Line is currently around 82.4%, defined as being less than 5 minutes behind schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/02/19/49937/how-late-are-los-angeles-buses-and-trains-depends/|title=How late are Los Angeles buses and trains?

On time performance benefits from the active traffic management system installed as part of the Metro ExpressLanes project.

==Incidents==

===Vehicle strike at the Harbor Freeway Station===
[[File:Harbor Freeway Metro Green &amp; Silver Lines Station- Picture 1.JPG|thumb|Metro Silver Line bus at Harbor Freeway station showing yellow bollards installed after a private vehicle drove onto the platform injuring waiting passengers.]]
Seven passengers waiting on the northbound platform of the [[Harbor Freeway (Los Angeles Metro station)|Harbor Freeway Station]] received critical and serious injuries when a private vehicle entered the station and struck the platform on February 22, 2012.&lt;ref name="thesource.metro.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesource.metro.net/2012/02/22/accident-on-harbor-transitway/ Source: Accident on The Harbor Transitway|date=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the accident Metro studied the design of the Silver Line stations and decided to add concrete filled metal bollards at the platform edge of a number of stations during August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metro.net/board/Items/2012/03_March/20120322RBMItem4Handout.pdf|title=Harbor Freeway Metro Silver Line Station platform improvements|date=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bollards are spaced close enough to stop a car from entering the platform, but have enough room to allow multiple buses to stop at the platform and lower the accessibility ramp.

==Fleet==
[[File:Harbor Gateway Transit Center 08.JPG|thumb|Metro Silver Line 45 foot NABI Compo bus]]
The Metro Silver Line is operated with a fleet of dedicated [[North American Bus Industries|NABI]] Metro 45C "CompoBus" coaches. Each {{convert|45|ft|m|adj=on}} long bus is made of light composite materials and is powered by CNG (Compressed Natural Gas). Coaches are painted or vinyl wrapped with a special grey livery that matches the design of newer Metro Rail vehicles and the coaches used on Metro Orange Line. Most coaches also have a vinyl decal that says "A faster way to Downtown: Metro Silver Line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/metrolibraryarchive/6026109345/|title=Silverline bus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where representations of a customer are held in more than one [[data set]], achieving a single customer view can be difficult: firstly because customer identity must be traceable between the records held in those systems, and secondly because anomalies or discrepancies in the customer data must be [[data cleansing|data cleansed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atominsight.com/about-us/blog/single-customer-view-hard|title=Why building a single customer view isn’t as easy as you might think|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the acquisition by an organisation of a single customer view is one potential outcome of successful [[master data management]]. Since 31 December, 2010, maintaining a single customer view, and submitting it within 72 hours, has become mandatory for [[financial institution]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] due to new rules introduced by the [[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]].&lt;ref name="Experian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fscs.org.uk/industry/single-customer-view/|title=Deposit Guarantee Scheme - Customer Review -FSCS|website=www.fscs.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Paul Street''' and '''Calvert Street''' are a [[one-way pair]] of streets in [[Downtown Baltimore]] and areas north. The streets, which are part of [[Maryland Route 2]], are two of Baltimore's best-known streets in the downtown area.

==St. Paul Street==
[[File:2016-07-13 15 53 12 View south along Maryland State Route 139 (St. Paul Street) at Charlcote Road in Baltimore City, Maryland.jpg|thumb|left|View south near the north end of St. Paul Street]]
St. Paul Street begins off [[Maryland Route 139|Charles Street]] just south of [[Coldspring Lane]] near [[Loyola College (Baltimore)|Loyola College]] (now renamed Loyola University Maryland) From this point on, the street runs directly parallel to North Charles Street, exactly one block east of Charles Street. It carries [[Maryland Route 139]] in the southbound direction until intersecting North Avenue (formerly Boundary Avenue with northern city limits of 1818-1888) ([[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|U.S. Route 1]]), where MD 139 ends.

St. Paul Street is two ways until the intersection with 31st Street. Northbound traffic is relegated to a single northbound lane, separated by median, and with metered [[parallel parking]].

St. Paul Street is exit 4 off the [[Jones Falls Expressway]] ([[I-83]]).

Approaching the downtown area moving south between East Centre and Lexington Streets, St. Paul Street is split into two parallel, nearby streets, also being identified as '''St. Paul Place''' in this area. The wider eastern thoroughfare was the former narrow alley-like Courtland Street, once flanked by rows of small brick and stone townhouses. While the more westward of the two sides of St. Paul Street / Place intersects with all east-west streets within these blocks, the eastward opposite wider side passes under the [[Orleans Street Viaduct]] ([[US 40 (MD)|US 40]]). The area between the two St. Paul Streets, landscaped into terraced gardens and parks with fountains are known as '''Preston Gardens''', replaced a group of 1820s [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]], [[Federal architecture|Federal]] and [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] styled architecture townhouses which had become shabby by the early 20th century along Courtland Street and the original parallel St. Paul Street  and the five square blocks north to south were razed in 1919 as the city's first "[[urban renewal]]" project and was landscaped by [[Thomas Hastings (architect)|Thomas Hastings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Power|first=Garrett|authorlink=|title=Apartheid Baltimore Style: The Residential Segregation Ordinances of 1910-1913|journal=Maryland Law Review|volume=42|issue=|pages=289, 316|publisher= |location= |date=December 1983|url= |doi= |id= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gardens are named after Baltimore politician [[James H. Preston]], who was mayor of the City of [[Baltimore]] (1911-1919, and a [[Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates|Speaker]] in 1894 of the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] of which he served 1890-1894.

==Calvert Street==
[[File:2016-07-27 08 45 44 View north along Maryland State Route 2 (Calvert Street) at Fayette Street and the Baltimore Battle Monument in Baltimore City, Maryland.jpg|right|thumb|Looking north towards the Battle Monument of 1815-1822 from the War of 1812, symbol of Baltimore on the city seal and flag on North Calvert Street, between East Fayette and Lexington Streets flanked by two municipal courthouses]]
As St. Paul Street is mostly one-way southbound, Calvert Street, which is directly east of St. Paul, is open to northbound traffic.  North Calvert Street is a name of a portion of the street north of its intersection with East Baltimore Street.  South Calvert Street is a name for the downtown portion running further south and alongside the [[Inner Harbor]] waterfront to the east.

Calvert Street begins at [[Pratt Street]] near the [[Inner Harbor]] and continues through the downtown area and various north Baltimore neighborhoods before terminating in the [[Guilford, Baltimore|Guilford]] neighborhood. of northern Baltimore.

At its railroad and [[Jones Falls]] stream crossing near I-83, Calvert Street once had an [[arch bridge|arch-style steel/iron bridge]] with lions sculptures at each end, though not as interesting looking as the one on nearby Charles Street or [[Howard Street (Baltimore)|Howard Street]] running parallel to the west. The present crossing on Calvert Street is ordinary-looking poured concrete construction.

===Notable landmarks===
* [[Baltimore City Circuit Courthouses|Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr. Courthouse]] of 1896-1900 (Baltimore City Circuit Courthouse and its opposite Courthouse East (former U.S. Courthouse and Post Office), from 1930-32) 
* [[Battle Monument]], 1815-1822, from the [[Battle of Baltimore]] of September 1814 in the [[War of 1812]]
* ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' newspaper building, 1950
* [[Union Memorial Hospital]]

==Light Street==
After passing [[Baltimore Street|East Baltimore Street]], St. Paul Street changes its name to '''Light Street'''. Light Street becomes a large, two-way street with center divider after passing East Pratt Street (which runs along the north shore of the [[Inner Harbor]] and municipal piers 1 to 6),  the point where South Calvert Street begins for northbound traffic. Light Street continues through [[Key Highway|Francis Scott Key Highway (Key Highway)]], passing through the [[Federal Hill, Baltimore|Federal Hill]] and old South Baltimore commercial district and tightly packed rowhouse neighborhoods and the Cross Street Market, one of Baltimore's formerly twelve municipal narkethouses (now down to six)  until its southern terminus at Wells Street, just east of parallel South Hanover Street ([[Maryland Route 2]]), above the north shore of the Middle Branch of the [[Patapsco River]] and [[Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]].
The street ends by the newly planned [[Port Covington]] redevelopment. project, for the former site of [[War of 1812]] supporting redoubt battery of Fort Covington from the [[Battle of Baltimore]] and later railyards with shipping piers for the old [[Western Maryland Railway]] from the late 1890s to early 1980s.

Though quite short in length, Light Street is well known in the area, forming the western boundary of the [[Inner Harbor]] tourist area. The formerly narrow cobble-stoned waterfront street clogged with horses and wagons and later early trucks was the site of the western shore piers for East Coast/[[Chesapeake Bay]] passenger steamboats such as the [[Old Bay Line]] and others in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, the Harborplace shopping pavilions (1980), the glass walled Baltimore Visitors Center (2010) are located here along with the [[Maryland Science Center]], founded 1797 was relocated here on the Light Street waterfront in 1976, and the former [[McCormick &amp; Company]] offices and manufacturing plant for spices. flavorings and seasonings between 1889/ rebuilt 1922 to 1989 was located facing Light Street at Conway Street, opposite the Inner Harbor.

Light Street is named for [[Darby Lux I]], an early Baltimore merchant who had a house on the street.

'''The Carling''', formerly known as the '''Carling Hotel''' and '''Hotel Roosevelt''', is a historic building in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], United States built in 1925. It is located at 31 West Adams Street in [[Downtown Jacksonville]]. As its former names indicates it was originally a [[hotel]], and was used for that purpose until 1964; it currently serves as a residential building.

==Construction==
The 13-story building originally contained 335 rooms and was designed by noted [[New York City]] architects ''Thompson, Holmes &amp; Converse'' in 1925 and held in Italian Renaissance style. A newspaper story depicted it as "300 rooms with bath, running ice water, fans and the latest equipment in the rooms. The three lower stories are faced with Indiana limestone above which is a shaft of red brick. The upper stories are trimmed with terra-cotta, and surmounted by a balustrade with limestone coping. The building is of completely fireproof construction."&lt;ref name=JHS&gt;Wood, Wayne &amp; Davis, Judy: [http://jaxhistory.com/Jax%20Arch%20Herit/D-7.htm ''Jacksonville's Architectural Heritage''], 1989, {{ISBN|0-8130-0953-7}}. Retrieved December 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When it opened on September 1, 1926, it was one of Jacksonville's finest hotels.&lt;ref name=STORY&gt;Marbut, Max: [http://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/downtowntoday.php?dt_date=2009-12-08 "The story behind one of Downtown’s historic buildings: The Carling"] ''Jacksonville Daily Record'', December 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CarlingHotel.JPG|left|200px|Carling Hotel in 1926]] --&gt;
Placement of the building was unusual at the time because it was situated in the middle of a block, rather than on a corner. It was constructed and managed by [[Atlanta]]'s Dinkler Hotel Company, which owned and operated nearly two dozen upscale hotels in the southeastern United States. The facility was named after [[Carling L. Dinkler]], who claimed to be the youngest hotel executive in the U.S.

==History==
The facility changed its name to the '''Hotel Roosevelt''' in 1936 and it was a downtown landmark for over a quarter century.&lt;ref name=STORY /&gt; A two-story addition was constructed in 1937 at the rear of the building which permits access from Monroe Street.&lt;ref name=VEST /&gt;

It was the site of the catastrophic [[Hotel Roosevelt fire]] in late December 1963, which claimed 22 lives and caused in excess of $350,000 in damage, forcing the hotel to close in 1964.

After being vacant for nearly 20 years, the structure was turned into apartments for retirees called ''Jacksonville Regency House'', but that operation ended in 1989.

On February 28, 1991, the site was added to the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Register of Historic Places]], but the building remained shuttered for almost 14 years. Little or no work was performed on the building's major components for almost 40 years; the structure's infrastructure was outdated with leaks and rot throughout.&lt;ref name=PAYS /&gt;

==Current use==
Jacksonville developer Vestcor began a historic preservation of the Carling in 2003 after obtaining a $16.5 million, 1.4% interest, 20-year loan and $5 million in grants, both from the city of Jacksonville.&lt;ref name=STORY /&gt;

Retrieved December 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; leading from the lobby to what was the ballroom on the second level. Elevators, HVAC, electrical, plumbing and other infrastructure was modernized and a 237-space parking garage was constructed adjacent to the Carling. The ballroom was converted into a large community club room, a fitness center and a media room. Modern amenities were added while respecting the historic integrity of the structure. The building was renamed The Carling, and its 100 apartments were opened in July 2005&lt;ref name=STORY /&gt; after $29 million and 20 months of construction.&lt;ref name=PAYS&gt;Witkowski, Rachel: [http://jacksonville.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2006/04/10/focus5.html "Costly renovation of historic buildings pays off for city"] ''Jacksonville Business Journal'', April 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Vestor began leasing space in the Carling's {{convert|15000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} commercial arcade in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vestcor.com/file_download/44 "Vestcor To Unveil Commercial Space In The Carling Building"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125075821/http://vestcor.com/file_download/44 |date=2011-11-25 }} Vestcor Companies website, October 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a gallery known as "The Art Center Cooperative, Inc." and a barber shop opened in the complex.

In late December 2009, Vestcor requested a modification to their loan terms, citing three years of operating losses on the Carling and their other renovated building, [[11 East Forsyth]]. The company asked for three years of interest-only payments plus low interest loans to potential tenants for the mostly empty commercial space in their buildings.&lt;ref name=HELP /&gt; Three months later, the city approved the plan for principal deferral but took no action on tenant loans.&lt;ref&gt;Bauerlein, David: [http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-03-11/story/jacksonville_finds_it_too_costly_to_pay_business%E2%80%99s_employee_parking_as_i "Jacksonville finds it too costly to pay business’s employee parking as incentive"] Florida Times-Union, March 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cpscmagnetixtoyrecall.jpg|thumb|[[Magnetix]], a popular construction toy selling over 3.8 million units, was recalled after injuries and a fatality when magnets came loose.]]
'''Toy safety''' is the practice of ensuring that [[toy]]s, especially those made for children, are safe, usually through the application of set [[safety standards]].  In many countries, commercial toys must be able to pass safety tests in order to be sold. In the U.S., some toys must meet national standards, while other toys may not have to meet a defined safety standard. In countries where standards exist, they exist in order to prevent accidents, but there have still been some high-profile [[product recall]]s after such problems have occurred.  The danger is often not due to faulty design; usage and chance both play a role in injury and death incidents as well.&lt;ref name="RoSPAFactsheet"&gt;The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]], March 2001.  "[http://www.rospa.com/productsafety/factsheets/toysafety.htm Toy Safety Factsheet]".  Accessed 8 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential hazards==
[[Image:Someone ate simba.JPG|right|thumb|Small toys may be swallowed by children, such as this electronic button seen in a child's stomach.  Toys stuck in the [[esophagus]] or too large to pass through the [[stomach]] may need to be removed with [[endoscopic foreign body retrieval|endoscopes]].]]
Common scenarios include:
*Ingestion of magnetic toys
*[[Choking]] or aspiration of small parts of the toy
*Cuts by sharp parts of the toy
*Motor toy vehicles incidents involving  hair 
*Chemical substance

==Accident frequency==
Accidents involving toys are quite common, with 40,000 happening each year in the United Kingdom (according to 1998 figures&lt;ref name="1998DTI"&gt;[[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], 2000 (using 1998 data).  "Home Accident Surveillance System, 22nd Annual report".&lt;/ref&gt; - data has not been collected in the UK since 2003&lt;ref&gt;[https://webgate.cec.eu.int/idbpa/test/welcome.jsp European Injury database&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;), accounting for less than 1% of annual accidents. In 2005 in the U.S., 20 children under 15 years of age died in incidents associated with toys, and an estimated 202,300 children under 15 were treated in U.S. hospital emergency rooms for injuries associated with toys, according to data from the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission|U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's]] National Electronic Injury Surveillance System.&lt;ref name="CPSC Toy Report"&gt;CSPC, 5 October 2006.  "[http://www.cpsc.gov/library/toymemo05.pdf Toy-Related Deaths and Injuries, Calendar Year 2005]".  Accessed 10 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Union, no fatal accidents have been reported in the European Injury Database since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;https://webgate.cec.eu.int/idbpa/test/result.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, home and leisure data was examined concerning injuries caused by falls to a lower level among 0-4-year-olds from Austria, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands and Sweden. It was found that children′s use of several product categories was closely related to age. Children′s furniture account for between 21% (Netherlands) and 34% (Sweden) of the injuries from falls to a lower level in the first living year, but decreased with increasing age in all countries. The same pattern applied to strollers. In contrast, injuries due to falls involving playground equipment increased with age to reach between 13 (Greece) and 34 (Netherlands) percent of injuries from falls to a lower level among 4-year-olds.

==Safety standards==
Distinction must be drawn between [[regulations]] and voluntary [[safety standards]]. From the table below, it can be seen that many regions model their safety standards on the EU's [[EN 71]] standard, either directly, or through adoption of the ISO 8124 standard which itself is modelled on EN 71.

(Source: [http://www.toy-icti.org/info/toysafetystandards.html ICTI Toy Safety Standards])

In [[Europe]] toys must meet the criteria set by the EC Toy Safety Directive (essentially that a toy be safe, which may be addressed by testing to European Standard EN71) in order for them to carry the [[CE mark]].  All European Union member states have transposed this directive into law - for example, the UK's Toy (Safety) Regulations 1995.&lt;ref name="lbwf"&gt;"[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1995/Uksi_19950204_en_1.htm The Toy (Safety) Regulations 1995]".  Accessed 7 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Trading Standards Officers in the UK, similarly to appropriate authorities in the other EU member states, have the power to immediately demand the withdrawal of a toy product from sale on safety grounds via the RAPEX recall notification system (used for all products subject to European safety legislation).&lt;ref name="RoSPAFactsheet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/dyna/rapex/rapex_archives_en.cfm EUROPA - Consumer Affairs - Safe Products&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515074207/http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/dyna/rapex/rapex_archives_en.cfm |date=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Canada]] the government [[Ministry (government department)|department]] [[Health Canada]] has the responsibility of ensuring product safety, just as the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) does in the [[United States]]. Australian and New Zealand toy safety standards (following the approximate model of the European Toy Safety Standard) have been adopted by the ISO as International Standard ISO 8124. Toy safety standards are continually updated and modified&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/standardization/harmstds/reflist/toys.html] Harmonised EU toy safety standards&lt;/ref&gt; as the understanding of risks increases and new products are developed.

===Appropriate age===
[[File:Age warning symbol.svg|thumb|Age warning symbol specified in the European standard [[EN 71]]-6.]]
Manufacturers often display information about the intended age of the children who will play with the toy.  In the U.S. this label is sometimes mandated by the CPSC, especially for toys which may present a [[choking]] hazard for children under three years of age. In most countries the intended age is either shown as a minimum age or as an age range.  While one reason for this is the complexity of the toy and how much it will interest or challenge children of different ages, another is to highlight that it may be unsafe for younger children. While a toy might be ''suitable'' for children of one age, and thus this is the age ''recommended'' on the product, there may be safety hazards associated with use by a lower age group, necessitating a mandatory warning. Some manufacturers also explain the specific dangers next to the advised age (as is mandated by European and International toy safety standards EN71 and ISO 8124 respectively, but not US standard ASTM F963).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berr.gov.uk/consumers/Safety/products/child-products/Toys/index.html Toy Safety Regulations - BERR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some accidents occur when babies play with toys intended for older children.&lt;ref name="RoSPAFactsheet"/&gt;

===United States regulations===
In August 2008, the [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act]] (''CPSIA'') was passed.  Some observers are of the opinion that this new law imposes the toughest toy-making standard in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-ap-consumer-safety,0,7590962.story | title=Bush signs bill banning lead from children's toys; toughest standard in the world | publisher=Associated Press | date=14 August 2008 | accessdate=15 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CPSIA restricts the amount of [[lead]] and [[phthalates]] that may be contained in children's products (ages 12 and under) and adopts the provisions of the ''ASTM Consumer Safety Specifications for Toy Safety'' (ASTM F963-11) as the requirements of the CPSC.&lt;ref&gt;15 USC 2051 Sec. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the US state of [[Minnesota]] introduced its own legislation that requires reporting information on a list of priority chemicals found in children’s products and sold in the state. This law demands all manufacturers of toys to provide the state of Minnesota with a report if their children’s products contain any of the priority chemicals such as [[Bisphenol A]], [[Formaldehyde]], [[lead]] or [[cadmium]].

===European regulations===
In Europe, the comprehensive legislation addressing toy safety is ''the Toy Safety Directive'' of the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]], ([[Council Directive]] 88/378/EEC). This directive is a list of requirements toys must comply with, and is interpreted in the laws of each member state of the EU in their respective Toy Safety Regulations (e.g.: the UK's ''Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 ([[Statutory Instrument]] 1995 No. 204)'').  This directive has been superseded by Council Directive 2009/48/EC&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:170:0001:0037:EN:PDF] Directive 2009/48/EC on the safety of toys&lt;/ref&gt; which will apply to toy imports into or toys produced within the EU as of 20 July 2011 except for the chemical requirements of Annex II which apply as of 20 July 2013. During these periods the corresponding requirements of the previous directive will continue to apply. Compliance with both directives leads to a [[CE Mark]], which is a mandatory requirement denoting conformity with all applicable directives. Some items specifically excluded from this legislation are: fashion jewellery for children, Christmas decorations, and sports equipment.  Official guidance on the classification of toys in the EU has been provided by the EU Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/toys/eg_guidance.htm] Official guidance on the classification of toys&lt;/ref&gt;  Where products are not classified as toys they will still be governed by the General Product Safety Directive.  The toy safety directive provides for harmonised EU-wide standards on physical and mechanical properties, flammability, chemical properties and electrical properties but certain essential safety aspects of the directives are not governed by safety standards e.g. hygiene and radioactivity.
The Toys Safety Directive (and subsequent Member State regulations) also calls for the closest applicable national or international standards to be applied where a standard is not specified in the Directive. This interpretive clause is present to ensure that new and innovative toys are safe before being placed on the market. The EN71 Toy Safety Standard has been harmonised by the EC as the default standard which toys must meet.
If a toy is found to be unsafe (by breaching one of the specified standards, or by a manifest risk of injury not specified in standards) then the producer (the manufacturer, or the first importer into the EU of the product unit in question) is held to be guilty of an offence under the Toys (Safety) Regulations (or equivalent EU state law). The principle of ''due diligence'' (whereby the producer argues that all reasonable steps were taken to ensure the safety of the consumer with regards to the toy) may be used (in the UK) by the producer to avoid prosecution, fines and possible imprisonment. The unsafe toy is withdrawn from the EU market, with all member states' authorities being notified by means of the RAPEX alert system.

The new Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC (TSD) requires a series of safety assessments, including the Chemical Safety Assessment (CSA). If the non-chemical requirements were already enforced in July 2011, the chemical requirements are to be enforced first on 20 July 2013. In 2009, the European Union adopted the new Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC (TSD). The [[Comité Européen de Normalisation]] or CEN wrote these standards in order for them to be harmonized under the Toy Safety Directive.  Official EU Guidance&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/4208/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native] Guidance document on the application of the toy safety directive 2009/48/EC&lt;/ref&gt; on the interpretation of the Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC exists and although non-binding, it has been agreed by a majority of EU Member States.

===Chinese regulations===
China's toy industry has been regulated since early 2007 by the expansion of the nation's compulsory certification system to include toy products.
Regulations require a manufacturers to apply for [[China Compulsory Certificate|China Compulsory Certification]] (CCC) from the nation's Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA). From 1 March, toy producers in China have been able to apply to three certification agencies nominated by the CNCA to certify their products. Toys are subject to inspection and certification review. Since 1 June 2007, no toy products without CCCs has been be allowed to leave factories, be sold or be imported into China.  It is hoped this measure will mitigate the increasing international pressure on environmental protection, as well as further expand the nation's toy export market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200604/01/eng20060401_255145.html People's Daily Online - Toy industry gets improved regulation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
This increase in scrutiny was introduced before the [[2007 Chinese export recalls]].

==Safety testing==
The EU Commission expert group on toy safety regularly publishes a large number of guidance documents &lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/toys/documents/guidance/index_en.htm European Guidance Documents on Toys]&lt;/ref&gt; intended to help on interpretation issues related to the [[Toy safety#European regulations|Toy Safety Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/toys/documents/guidance/index_en.htm Guidance documents from the Expert Group on Toy Safety] European Commission, Retrieved 27 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Toy manufacturers need stay ahead of regulatory changes and be sure that their products comply with the new requirements.

Therefore, it is vital to perform tests and risk assessments for every product before selling them in the designated market. This is important for every manufacturer as they can be held liable for injuries and fatalities resulting from design flaws, use of unsuitable materials, and substandard production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btha.co.uk/dynamic/documents/toysafety/06%20Safety%20Assessment%20of%20Toys%20-%20Daryl%20Scrivens.pdf Safety Assessment of Toys]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following safety tests are performed:
* Mechanical/physical testing
* Flammability testing
* Electrical safety testing
* Labeling
* Chemical testing

Product safety/risk assessment (also known as product hazard analysis) can identify potential hazards and provide solutions early in the product life cycle to prevent products becoming stalled in production or recalled once they are released onto the market. During risk assessments for toys possible hazards and potential exposure are analyzed. Additionally the manufacturing of the toys will be controlled to ensure safety and quality throughout production.

The new European standard EN 71-4:2013 was published in 2013. It replaces and updates the 2009 version of the same standard since the latter and newest has been harmonized under the EU [[Toy Safety]] Directive. The new method is a reference test method regulating [[chemicals]] in toys and juvenile products. This gives a new test method for 'Experimental sets for chemistry and related activities' under the toy safety EN 71 series.

==International commerce==
International commerce plays a big role in toy safety. In the first four months of 2006, China exported US$4 billion worth of toys. The United States contributed 70 percent of the global market by exporting US$15.2 billion in toys in 2005.  The European Union accounts for 75% of the final disposition of these toys. From January 2005 through September 2006, products originating in China were responsible for about 48 percent of product recalls in the U.S., and a similar percentage of notifications in the EU.&lt;ref name="China Econ Review"&gt;China Economic Review, January 2007.  "[http://www.chinaeconomicreview.com/subscriber/articledetail/1526.htmll REPORTS / Better safe than sorry]".  Accessed 10 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of process control in sub-contracted vendors has been a contributing factor in recent high-profile cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6948274.stm | work=BBC News | title='Brand China' at risk after toy recall | date=15 August 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moves toward global standards===
Although an international toy safety standard exists, nations around the world still create their own legislation and standards to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toy-icti.org/info/toysafetystandards.html Toy Safety Standards Around the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Current toy safety standards focus on design principles and rely on batch testing of samples to assure safety. As has been seen in the large scale [[2007 Chinese export recalls|recalls of 2007]], sample testing can miss non-conforming product. A design may be conceptually safe, but without control of the production, the design may not be met by the manufacturer. Similarly, the applicable toy safety standards to which a toy is tested by a laboratory may not discover a hazard in a product: in the case of 2007's magnetic toy recalls and the Bindeez recall, the products in question met the requirements laid down in the applicable safety standard, yet were found to present an inherent risk.
Proposed process and quality control standards, similar to the [[ISO 9000]] systems, seek to eliminate production errors and control materials to avoid deviation from the design.
The creation of manufacturing quality standards for toys will help ensure consistency of production. Using a continual improvement model, production can be subject to constant scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/management_standards/iso_9000_iso_14000/qmp/qmp-6.htm Quality management principles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than assuming the compliance of all production by testing random samples.
In October and November 2007, mandatory third party testing by companies such as [http://www.lga.de/ LGA], [http://www.eurofins.com/product-testing-services/industries/toy-testing.aspx Eurofins], [[Bureau Veritas]] or SGS Consumer Testing Services was proposed by regulators in the EU and US, to a (possibly new) international standard, requiring a new safety mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUKL0889219620071108?pageNumber=1 | work=Reuters | title=EU, U.S. seek new global toy safety standard | first=Darren | last=Ennis | date=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://engineers.ihs.com/news/ansi-toy-safety.htm ANSI: Toy Safety Takes High Priority with Standards Developers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication that the proposals will address manufacturing control.

==Product recalls and safety hazards==
The ability to [[product recall|recall]] a product from the market is a necessary part of any safety legislation. If existing quality and safety checks fail to detect an issue prior to sale, a systematic method of notifying the public and removing potentially hazardous products from the market is needed.
Some toys have been discovered to have been unsafe after they have been placed on the market.  Before the introduction of safety monitoring organisations the toys were simply stopped being manufactured if any action was taken at all{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, but since then there have been many toys that have been recalled by their manufacturer.  In some notable cases the problem has only been found after the injury or even death of a person that purchased the product.

Choking is the number one reason for accidents, but chemicals such as lead can also cause developmental problems like behavioral disorders and sickness. Exposure to lead can affect almost every organ and system in the human body, especially the central nervous system. Lead is especially toxic to the brains of young children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.xos.com/blog/bid/343549/EPA-Prevention-Week-Highlights-the-Importance-of-Lead-Detection EPA Lead Safety Week]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, the CPSC and Customs and Border Protection are responsible for screening children's products imported into the country.  Just less than 10% of products screened are stopped for violations.  Nearly two thirds are stopped for lead violations and 15% are stopped for choking hazards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cpsc.gov/en/Newsroom/News-Releases/2013/More-than-48M-Units-of-Violative-Imported-Products-Kept-at-Bay-During-Fiscal-Year-2012/ More than 4.8M Units of Violative Imported Products Kept at Bay During Fiscal Year 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom toys are regulated by the Toy Product Safety Regulations 1995 which require that toys must not be sold if they do not have the correct safety labels.

===Examples===

====Bindeez/Beados====
Batches of [[Bindeez]] were recalled in November 2007 after several children swallowed beads and were adversely affected. Upon ingestion, a chemical used in the product metabolized in the stomach into the sedative drug, [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]]. The design called for a different, non-toxic chemical, but this had been substituted with an alternative chemical, which had approximately the same functional properties. The name was changed to "Beados" in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theillustrator.ca/Headlines/China-admits-that-poison-was-in-toys.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids====
The [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] dolls were very popular in the 1980s across North America and many parts of Europe.  The "Cabbage Patch Kids Snacktime Kids" line of dolls were an early 1990s incarnation designed to "eat" [[plastic]] snacks.  The mechanism was a pair of one-way metal rollers behind a plastic slot and rubber lips, and there were 35 reported incidents in which a child's hair or finger was caught in the mouths.  On 31 December 1996, after 700,000 dolls were distributed in the [[United States]] in just five months, the CPSC along with manufacturers [[Mattel]] announced that they would place warning information labels on all unsold dolls.&lt;ref name="KidSourceCPK"&gt;KidSource, 31 December 1996.  "[http://www.kidsource.com/cpsc/cabbage.warning.html CPSC and Mattel Announce Warning for Cabbage Patch Doll]".  Accessed 5 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, in January 1997, CPSC and Mattel announced that all Cabbage Patch Kids Snacktime Kids were being removed from the market.&lt;ref name="CPSC Cabbage Patch Press Release"&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC), 6 January 1997.  "[http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml97/97055.html Mattel and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Announce Voluntary Refund Program for Cabbage Patch Kids &amp; Snacktime Kids Dolls] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220001659/http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML97/97055.html |date=20 February 2008 }}". Nowadays, some websites on the Internet say that the dolls are evil and eat human flesh. Another website, www.thetoyzone.com, said that it's one of the 20 things that you never want to see under a [[Christmas tree]]. Accessed 15 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lawn darts====
[[Image:Lawndart.jpg|thumb|A safety warning given out by the CPSC.]]
[[Lawn darts]] are large, weighted darts intended to be tossed underhand towards a horizontal ground target.  On 19 December 1988, all lawn darts were banned from sale in the United States by the Consumer Product Safety Commission after they were responsible for the deaths of three children since 1970.&lt;ref name="CPSCLawnDarts"&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC).  "[http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PUBS/5053.pdf CPSC Bans Lawn Darts]".  Accessed 5 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, they were also banned in Canada.&lt;ref name="HCSC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/pubs/occup-travail/ref_man/hpa_schedule-annexes_lpd-eng.pdf | title=HPA, Schedule I, Part I - "Prohibited Products" | accessdate=25 January 2011 | date=1 October 2001 | publisher=Health Canada | quote=38. Lawn darts with elongated tips.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magnetix====
One death and four serious injuries led to the recall of 3.8 million [[Magnetix]] building sets in March 2006.  The [[magnets]] inside the plastic building pieces could fall out and be swallowed or aspirated.&lt;ref name="CPSCMagnetix"&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC), 31 March 2006.  "[http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml06/06127.html Child’s Death Prompts Replacement Program of Magnetic Building Sets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405113358/http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml06/06127.html |date=5 April 2006 }}".  Accessed 8 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, Avolio L and Martucciello G published on The New England Journal of Medicine the effects of magnetic toys ingestion in two children ("Ingested Magnets".Luigi Avolio, M.D., and Giuseppe Martucciello, M.D. N Engl J Med 2009; 360:2770 June 25, 2009)
Since then MEGA Brands has implemented design enhancements to Magnetix, including sonic welding of panels, 100% inspection, gluing magnets into rods, elimination of 3+ labeling in favor of 6+ labeling after it assumed operational control of [[Rose Art]] on 1 January 2006. Only safe and improved products are currently on store shelves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml07/07164.html Magnetix Magnetic Building Set Recall Expanded&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422155224/http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml07/07164.html |date=22 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polly Pocket====
In November 2006 4.4 million [[Polly Pocket]] Quik-Clik sets were recalled by Mattel after children in the United States swallowed loose magnetic parts.  The toys had been sold around the world commencing three years previous.&lt;ref name="ScotsmanPP"&gt;[[The Scotsman]], 22 November 2006.  "[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=1728192006 Toy recall over magnet hazard] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116050215/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=1728192006 |date=16 November 2007 }}".  Accessed 8 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Clackers ====
[[Clackers]] were discontinued when reports came out of children becoming injured while playing with them and after a ruling in [[United States v. Article Consisting of 50,000 Cardboard Boxes More or Less, Each Containing One Pair of Clacker Balls]] that they were hazards in the United States. Fairly heavy and fast-moving, and made of hard [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic plastic]], the balls would occasionally shatter upon striking each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Google | title = Books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pz8mD9Vn6OQC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=clackers+toy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hbPqTqKDOozKiQLO6InPBA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=clackers%20toy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Razor Scooter ====
The CSPC issued a voluntary Razor scooter recall, specifically targeting the Razor PowerWing three-wheeled scooters. Around 103,000 Razor scooters were affected by this recall. The reason for the [[Razor scooter]] recall is that the underside of the foot platform can have sharp edges, thus leading to a laceration hazard to kids who are riding the vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
