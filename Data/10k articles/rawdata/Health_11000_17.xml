In March–August 1962, a radiation incident in Mexico City occurred when a ten-year-old boy took home an unprotected industrial [[Radiographic equipment|radiography source]].&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Radiation Biology, 1998, vol. 73, no. 4, p.437 Online: http://www.reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/8929/Seminars/2009_05_RadiationAccidents.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Four people died from overexposure to [[radiation]] from a 5-Ci [[cobalt-60]] capsule, an industrial radiography orphaned source that was not contained in its proper shielding. For several days, the boy kept the capsule in his pocket, then placed it in the kitchen cabinet of his home in Mexico City. Having obtained the source on March 21, the boy died 38 days later on April 29. Subsequently, his mother died on July 10; his 2-year-old sister died on August 18, and his grandmother died on October 15 of that year. The boy's father also received a significant dose of radiation, however he survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Wm.

An '''abortion clinic''' is a medical facility that provides [[abortion]]s. Such [[clinics]] may be public medical centers, private medical practices or nonprofit organizations such as [[Planned Parenthood]].

==Statistics==

===Canada===
*There were 197 abortion providers in [[Canada]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=eggertson2001&gt;{{Cite journal|author =Eggertson L |title=Abortion services in Canada: a patchwork quilt with many holes |journal=[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] |volume=164 |issue=6 |pages=847–9|date=March 2001 |pmid=11276554 |doi= |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/164/6/847 |pmc=80888}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*34 of the 197 providers in Canada in 2001 were clinics and 167 were hospitals.&lt;ref name=eggertson2001 /&gt;
*The [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] with the most providers were [[Ontario]] (76 hospitals, 6 clinics), [[Quebec]] (30 hospitals, 19 clinics), and [[British Columbia]] (37 hospitals, 3 clinics) in 2001.&lt;ref name=eggertson2001 /&gt;
*The [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] with the fewest providers were [[Prince Edward Island]] (none), [[Nunavut]] (one hospital), and [[Yukon]] (one hospital) in 2001.&lt;ref name=eggertson2001 /&gt;

===United States===
*There were 1,793 abortion providers in the [[United States]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=jones2008&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Jones RK, Kooistra K |title=Abortion Incidence and Access to Services In the United States, 2008 |journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=41–50|date=March 2011 |pmid=21388504 |doi= 10.1363/4304111|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4304111.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*381 of the 1,787 providers in the U.S. in 2005 were clinics at which the majority of patient visits were for abortions.&lt;ref name=jones2005&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Jones RK, Zolna MR, Henshaw SK, Finer LB |title=Abortion in the United States: incidence and access to services, 2005 |journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=6–16|date=March 2008 |pmid=18318867 |doi= 10.1363/4000608|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/psrh/full/4000608.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every [[U.S. state|state]] (and the [[District of Columbia]]) had at least one provider in 2008.&lt;ref name=jones2008 /&gt;
*The states with the most providers were [[California]] (522) and [[New York (state)|New York]] (249) in 2008.&lt;ref name=jones2008 /&gt;
*The states with the fewest providers were [[North Dakota]] (one) and [[South Dakota]] (two) in 2008.&lt;ref name=jones2008 /&gt;
*13% of all [[County (United States)|counties]] in the United States had a provider in 2008.&lt;ref name=jones2008 /&gt;
*31% of metropolitan counties and 3% of non-metropolitan counties had a provider in 2005.&lt;ref name=jones2005 /&gt;

==Anti-abortion protests==
Abortion clinics have frequently been the site of protests by [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion activists]]. Protesters often engage in what is known as "[[sidewalk counseling]]", in which they warn people entering the clinic about alleged [[Abortion#Safety|risks of abortion]], attempt to offer alternatives to abortion or show pictures of [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=nytimes-protests&gt;Julie Bosman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/06/nyregion/06abortion.html?_r=0 "Anti-Abortion Activists Worry That a New City Law Will Make Their Task Harder"], ''The New York Times'', 5 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, 85%  of abortion providers were experiencing either picketing, clinic blockades or invasion of the facility,&lt;ref name="Doan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation:The abortion wars and strategies of political harassment|author =Alesha E. Doan|year=2007|page=23|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 19% or providers receiving bomb threats and 16% were picketed at their homes .{{sfn|Doan|2007|p=106}} In 2000 82% of facilities received protests with 61% receiving 20 or more pickets. {{sfn|Doan|2007|p=115}}

The 2007 film ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' contains an example of such protest. The protagonist enters a clinic with the purpose of procuring an abortion, but sees a fellow student protesting outside the clinic who tells her that the fetus "[[Prenatal development|has fingernails]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/20/diablo-cody-screenwriter-young-adult|title=Diablo Cody: devil's advocate|last=Freeman|first=Hadley|date=20 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes Juno to change her mind about having an abortion, and she leaves the clinic, with her friend calling out to her, "God appreciates your miracle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/23/1|title=Just don't say the A-word|last=Clarke|first=Cath|date=23 November 2007|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tactic in which protestors film or photograph patients entering the clinic utilizes the societal [[Social stigma|stigma]] surrounding abortion and attempts to expose or shame women who are seeking the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1022539371607091560|title=Abortion Protesters Use Cameras, Raise New Legal Issues, Lawsuits|last=Journal|first=Yochi J. Dreazen Staff Reporter of The Wall Street|date=2002-05-28|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-abortion movements|Anti-abortion activists]] have also attempted to access abortion clinic medical records by breaking into dumpsters, proposing state legislation that would require clinics to provide information regarding their patients to the government and hacking online databases containing confidential patient information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/05/10/abortions_made_public/|title=Abortions made public|last=Carmon|first=Irin|website=Salon|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, a [[Legal protection of access to abortion|buffer zone]] is enforced to prevent protesters from standing within a certain distance of the clinic entrance.&lt;ref name="britishcolumbialaw"&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96001_01 Access to Abortion Services Act]. Retrieved December 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States these buffer zones have been the subject of many lawsuits and legislative actions on both statewide and national levels. In 2014 the Supreme Court struck down a Massachusetts bill that had legalized a 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics in the state in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/us/supreme-court-abortion-clinic-protests.html|title=Court Rejects Zone to Buffer Abortion Clinic|last=Liptak|first=Adam|date=2014-06-26|last2=Schwartz|first2=John|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abortion Clinic Access ==
One way that anti-abortion activists have [[Types of abortion restrictions in the United States#Laws targeting abortion clinics|restricted access to abortion]] is through systematically forcing the closure of abortion clinics across the country. Between 2011 and 2016 162 abortion clinics in the United States closed or stopped offering abortions due largely to legislative regulations enacted by pro-life politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-24/abortion-clinics-are-closing-at-a-record-pace|title=Abortion Clinics Are Closing at a Record Pace|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bills, referred to as TRAP (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Provider) laws implement medically unnecessary restrictions for clinics that will be difficult or impossible for providers to meet, therefore forcing clinics to close under the guise of increasing the safety of the procedure.

Access to abortions is extremely limited, particularly in rural and conservative areas. According to the [[Guttmacher Institute]], 31% of women in rural areas traveled over 100 miles in order to receive an abortion while another 43% traveled between 50–100 miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2013/one-third-us-women-seeking-abortions-travel-more-25-miles-access-services|title=One-Third of U.S. Women Seeking Abortions Travel More Than 25 Miles to Access Services|date=2013-07-26|newspaper=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers are only increasing as more clinics are forced to close. Between 2011 and 2016 the number of abortion clinics in [[Texas]] dropped from 40 to 19&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2016/06/28/texas-abortion-clinics-have-closed-hb2-passed-2013/|title=Texas Abortion Clinics That Have Closed Since 2013|last=Tribune|first=The Texas|date=2016-06-28|website=The Texas Tribune|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of the state's House Bill 2, a TRAP law designed to force clinics into closure, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in June, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2016/06/28/texas-abortion-clinics-have-closed-hb2-passed-2013/|title=Texas Abortion Clinics That Have Closed Since 2013|last=Tribune|first=The Texas|date=2016-06-28|website=The Texas Tribune|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-abortion violence==
{{Main|Anti-abortion violence}}
Abortion clinics have frequently been subject to anti-abortion violence. ''[[The New York Times]]'' cites over one hundred clinic bombings and incidents of arson, over three hundred invasions, and over four hundred incidents of vandalism between 1978 and 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Death of Dr. Gunn |work= The New York Times |date=March 12, 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/opinion/the-death-of-dr-gunn.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Abortion Federation]], an organization of abortion providers, cites over 300 attempted or completed instances of bombing or arson, thousands of invasions and vandalism incidents, as well as other attacks, between 1977 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;National Abortion Federation (2009), [http://www.prochoice.org/pubs_research/publications/downloads/about_abortion/violence_stats.pdf  "Incidence of Violence &amp; Disruption Against Abortion Providers in the U.S. &amp; Canada"]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NAF, the first instance of arson at an abortion clinic took place in March 1976 in Oregon, and the first bombing was in Ohio in February 1978.&lt;ref&gt;National Abortion Federation. (2007). "[http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/violence/arsons.asp Arsons and Bombings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926221700/http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/violence/arsons.asp |date=September 26, 2011 }}."&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable incidents are:
*In 1993, Dr. [[David Gunn (doctor)|David Gunn]], one of a number of doctors murdered by opponents of abortion rights, was shot and killed outside as he arrived at his clinic.
*In 1993, Dr. [[George Tiller]] was shot in both arms by [[Shelley Shannon]] outside his clinic. Tiller would later be murdered in church by another opponent of abortion rights.
*In 1994, Dr. [[John Britton (doctor)|John Britton]], another doctor, and James Barrett, his escort, were shot and killed by [[Paul Jennings Hill]] as they arrived at a clinic. Barrett's wife June was also wounded.
*In 1994, [[John Salvi]] shot and killed two abortion clinic receptionists, Shannon Lowney and Lee Ann Nichols, and wounded five other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/aron/salvi021996.htm |first=Christopher B. |last=Daly |date=March 19, 1996 |title=Salvi Convicted of Murder in Shootings }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1998, a remote-controlled pipe bomb that [[Eric Robert Rudolph]] set outside a clinic killed security guard Robert Sanderson and maimed nurse [[Emily Lyons]].
*In 2001, [[Peter James Knight]] shot and killed a security guard, Steven Rogers, at the abortion clinic where Rogers worked.
*In 2015, [[Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting|a shooting incident]] occurred at a [[Planned Parenthood]] clinic in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] which resulted in three fatalities, including a police officer, and in multiple injuries to other clinic workers and patients.

In the United States, the [[Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act]] was passed in 1994 in response to acts of violence at clinics, which prohibits the use of force or obstruction to interfere with a person's attempt to obtain or provide reproductive health services, and the intentional damage of a reproductive health care facility such as an abortion clinic.

'''Asthma''' is a common [[chronic (medicine)|long-term]] [[inflammation|inflammatory]] disease of the [[bronchi|airways]] of the lungs.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible [[Airway obstruction|airflow obstruction]], and [[bronchospasm]].&lt;ref name="NHLBI07p11-12"&gt;{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms include episodes of [[wheezing]], [[coughing]], chest tightness, and [[shortness of breath]].&lt;ref name=bts2009p4&gt;{{harvnb|British Guideline|2009|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes may occur a few times a day or a few times per week.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Pathophysiology of asthma}}

Asthma is the result of chronic [[inflammation]] of the [[conducting zone]] of the airways (most especially the [[bronchus|bronchi]] and [[bronchiole]]s), which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding [[smooth muscle]]s.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=GINA2011p2/&gt; --&gt; This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=GINA2011p2/&gt; --&gt; The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=GINA2011p2/&gt; --&gt; Occasionally the airways themselves change.&lt;ref name=GINA2011p2/&gt; Typical changes in the airways include an increase in [[eosinophils]] and thickening of the [[lamina reticularis]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=M38/&gt; --&gt; Chronically the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=M38/&gt; --&gt; Other cell types involved include: [[T lymphocytes]], [[macrophages]], and [[neutrophils]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=M38/&gt; --&gt; There may also be involvement of other components of the [[immune system]] including: [[cytokines]], [[chemokines]], [[histamine]], and [[leukotrienes]] among others.&lt;ref name=M38/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.&lt;ref name=M38/&gt; It is defined by the [[Global Initiative for Asthma]] as "a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment".&lt;ref name=GINA2011p2 /&gt;

There is currently no precise test for the diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time.&lt;ref name=Lemanske2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=M38/&gt; A diagnosis of asthma should be suspected if there is a history of recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution.&lt;ref name=NAEPP42&gt;{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spirometry]] is then used to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=NAEPP42/&gt; In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry.&lt;ref name=GINA2011p20&gt;{{harvnb|GINA|2011|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second ([[spirometry|FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]), and [[peak expiratory flow rate]].&lt;ref name=Yawn2008/&gt; Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic), based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens (atopic) or not (non-atopic).&lt;ref name="RobbinsCotran2010"/&gt; While asthma is classified based on severity, at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system.&lt;ref name=Moore2010&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Moore W.

An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an ''asthma attack''.

Signs occurring during an asthma attack include the use of accessory [[muscle]]s of respiration ([[sternocleidomastoid]] and [[scalene muscles]] of the neck), there may be a [[pulsus paradoxus|paradoxical pulse]] (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation), and over-inflation of the chest.&lt;ref name=Maitre1995&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Maitre B., Similowski T., Derenne J.

[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma.  After the age of 65, most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD.  In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi.  However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and smoking cessation.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibson PG, McDonald VM, Marks GB |title=Asthma in older adults |journal=Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9743 |pages=803–13 |date=September 2010 |pmid=20816547 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61087-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.&lt;ref name="pmid16880365"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hargreave|first=FE|author2=Parameswaran, K|title=Asthma, COPD and bronchitis are just components of airway disease|journal=European Respiratory Journal|date=August 2006|volume=28|issue=2|pages=264–7|doi=10.1183/09031936.06.00056106|pmid=16880365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Applied Therapeutics 2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diaz, P.

While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ripoll|first=Brian C.

This plan should include the reduction of exposure to allergens, testing to assess the severity of symptoms, and the usage of medications. The treatment plan should be written down and advise adjustments to treatment according to changes in symptoms.&lt;ref name=GINA_2011_page56&gt;{{harvnb|GINA|2011|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as [[Health effects of tobacco smoking|cigarette smoke]], pets, or [[aspirin-induced asthma|aspirin]], and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended.  Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories.&lt;ref name=NHLBI07p213&gt;{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BGMA08&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign101.pdf |title=British Guideline on the Management of Asthma|format=PDF|publisher=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network|year=2008 |accessdate=2008-08-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080819203455/http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign101.pdf| archivedate= 19 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bronchodilators]] are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NAEPP/&gt; --&gt; In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NAEPP/&gt; --&gt; If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, an [[leukotriene antagonist]] or a [[mast cell stabilizer]] by mouth is recommended.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NAEPP/&gt; --&gt; For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, corticosteroids by mouth are added to these treatments.&lt;ref name="NHLBI07p214" /&gt;

People with asthma have higher rates of [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=Kew2016/&gt; This is associated with poorer asthma control.&lt;ref name=Kew2016/&gt; [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels in people with asthma.&lt;ref name=Kew2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kew|first=Kayleigh M.|last2=Nashed|first2=Marina|last3=Dulay|first3=Valdeep|last4=Yorke|first4=Janelle|date=2016-09-21|title=Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for adults and adolescents with asthma|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=9|pages=CD011818|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011818.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27649894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lifestyle modification===

Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks.

===Medications===

Medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms; and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation.&lt;ref name="NHLBI07p213" /&gt; [[Antibiotic]]s are generally not needed for sudden worsening of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QRG 153 • British guideline on the management of asthma|url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/QRG153.pdf|website=SIGN|accessdate=6 October 2016|date=September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009122108/http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/QRG153.pdf|archivedate=9 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fast–acting====

====Long–term control====

====Delivery methods====

Medications are typically provided as [[metered-dose inhaler]]s (MDIs) in combination with an [[asthma spacer]] or as a [[dry powder inhaler]]. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A [[nebulizer]] may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.&lt;ref name="NHLBI07p250"&gt;{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Travers|first=Andrew H.|last2=Milan|first2=Stephen J.|last3=Jones|first3=Arthur P.|last4=Camargo|first4=Carlos A.|last5=Rowe|first5=Brian H.|date=2012-12-12|title=Addition of intravenous beta(2)-agonists to inhaled beta(2)-agonists for acute asthma|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=12|pages=CD010179|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010179|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23235685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He experienced recurring nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, terrifying the boy and his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David McCullough|title=Mornings on Horseback: The Story of an Extraordinary Family, a Vanished Way of Life and the Unique Child Who Became Theodore Roosevelt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nuzmvrqPvdIC&amp;pg=PA93|year=1981|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=93–108|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407004947/http://books.google.com/books?id=nuzmvrqPvdIC&amp;pg=PA93|archivedate=2015-04-07|df=|isbn=9780743218306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s to 1950s, asthma was known as one of the "holy seven" [[psychosomatic illness]]es. Its cause was considered to be psychological, with treatment often based on psychoanalysis and other [[talking cure]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid16185365"/&gt; As these psychoanalysts interpreted the asthmatic wheeze as the suppressed cry of the child for its mother, they considered the treatment of depression to be especially important for individuals with asthma.&lt;ref name="pmid16185365"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Opolski M, Wilson I |title=Asthma and depression: a pragmatic review of the literature and recommendations for future research |journal=Clin Pract Epidemiol Ment Health |volume=1 |page=18 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16185365 |pmc=1253523 |doi=10.1186/1745-0179-1-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Бакулева}}) is attached to the [[Russian Academy of Medical Sciences]] and is one of the leading [[cardiovascular surgery]]-related facilities of the [[Russian Federation]]. The center consists of [[Burakovskiy Institute of Cardiac Surgery]] and the Institute of Coronary and Vascular Surgery, both located in [[Moscow]], as wells as it has a filial branch in [[Perm]] - Perm Heart Institute. In 2005 the Center started the first phase of research into the transplant of [[marrow cells]] in patients with [[acute myocardial infarction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= ISTC - Myocardial infarction and cell therapy|url= http://www.istc.ru/istc/sc.nsf/news/Myocardial-infarction.htm |publisher=  |first= |last= |date= 2005-08-25|accessdate= 2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Center was founded in 1956 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] surgeon [[Aleksandr Bakulev]], being officially named the Thoracal Surgery Institute of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR (Институт грудной хирургии Академии медицинских наук СССР) at the time. In 1961 the facility was renamed to the Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery and in 1967, following Bakulev's death, gained his name.

The [[US Department of Education]]'s '''National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation''' ('''[[National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation|NCFMEA]]''') recognizes CAAM-HP as a standard comparable to the standards used in medical schools in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (NCFMEA)|url = http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/ncfmea.html#decisions|website =2.ed.gov|date = 2016-01-13|accessdate = 2016-01-15|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The departments of education from both United States and Canada contacted the [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]] ([[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates|ECFMG]]) and has required that all Caribbean Medical Schools be at the standard of United States and Canadian medical schools, this led the CARICOM to create the Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (CAAM-HP)&lt;ref&gt;http://caam-hp.org/about.html#establishment&lt;/ref&gt; organization who will be assessing Caribbean medical schools. Students of those schools that do not receive accreditation from CAAM-HP or another regional accrediting body recognized by the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME)&lt;ref&gt;http://wfme.org/accreditation/recognition-programme/&lt;/ref&gt; will not be able to complete neither [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]] examinations nor [[Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination|MCCQE]], and therefore will not be able to become United States or Canadian doctors, if their school is not certified by the year 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caam-hp.org/documents/CAAM-HP%20Int%27l%20Recognition.pdf|title=CAAM-HP Creates History - International Recognition Granted!|last=|first=|date=|website=CAAM-HP|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlos Baca''' (born July 24, 1951) is a Mexican intellectual, cartoonist, visual artist, ecologist, [[yogi]], writer and [[rock music]] critic. He is most recognized for being a key figure of the [[counterculture]] movement known as [[La Onda]] and the creator of the comic strip character ''Avandarito''.

==Early years and studies ==
Born as Carlos Eduardo Baca Delgado in Mexico City, he was attracted to nature from early childhood, spending long hours in the famous [[Bosque de Chapultepec|Chapultepec Woods]]. From 1969 to 1979 he studied [[Yoga]] and [[vegetarianism]] at the [[Universal Great Brotherhood]]  becoming an international teacher and lecturer afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baca|first1=Carlos|title=Biografia|url=http://www.carlosbaca.mx/biografia.html|website=Carlos Baca|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counterculture years: Communal life, ''Avandaro'' and ''La Onda'' ==
In 1968 he was invited to collaborate with the magazine ''México Canta'' and by 1969 he was appointed its director. At the same time he was also hired as collaborator in the ''POP'' magazine, writing about philosophy and ecology and making memorable interviews to artists such as [[Juan Gabriel]], [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Love Army]], [[Jim Morrison]], [[Joan Manuel Serrat]], [[Janis Joplin]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez Chelico|first1=Javier|title=Carlos Baca y México Canta|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/11/15/espectaculos/a12o1esp|accessdate=14 November 2014|agency=La Jornada|publisher=UNAM|date=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernandez Chelico|first1=Javier|title=Revistas, didactismos y rock|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2014/04/12/espectaculos/a11o1esp|accessdate=14 November 2014|agency=La Jornada|publisher=UNAM|date=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zolov|first1=Eric|title=Refried Elvis: The rise of the Mexican counterculture|date=July 1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=USA|isbn=9780520215146|edition=1st|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft5q2nb3w6&amp;brand=ucpress|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, together with other La Onda stars such as [[Mayita Campos]], [[José Roberto Hill]] and [[Margarita Bauche]], he funded the [[commune]] ''La Nueva Familia'' (The new family) in San Lorenzo Acopilco, outside Mexico City. The hippie commune was notable for its production of bread and cereals.

In September of the same year he went to the [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro|Avandaro Festival]] to make a reportage on site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baca|first1=Carlos|title=La noche de Avandaro|journal=México Canta|date=19 September 1971|volume=252|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since he was highly revered by the ''[[jipitecas]]'' and his La Onda peers, he was persuaded by [[Armando Molina]], the festival's appointed music coordinator, to inaugurate the festival with a yoga session and an ecology lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garcia Michel|first1=Hugo|title=Yo vi a la encuerada de Avandaro|url=http://www.drogasmexico.org/index.php?nota=4832|accessdate=14 November 2014|agency=MILENIO|date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marroquin|first1=Enrique|title=Dios quiere que llueva para unirnos.|journal=Piedra Rodante|date=30 October 1971|volume=1|issue=6|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the festival he created the comic strip "Aliviane a la Madre Tierra" (Aid to Mother Earth) including its famous character "Avandarito" which was included as part of the POP magazine and was printed from 1971 to 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jiménez Izquierdo|first1=Juan|title=Avandaro: Una leyenda.|date=2011|publisher=ERIDU|location=Mexico|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years ==
By 1974 as the [[hippie movement]] waned world wide and the commune members dispersed each pursuing their own goals in their careers, Baca focused his attention to further his knowledge of nature studying in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[New Mexico]] and attending several seminars. He published his book ''Nutrición Natural al Alcance de Todos'' (Natural nutrition for all) in 1976, starting a notable career which expands 4 decades as a lecturer and writer of ecology, nutrition and environmental issues. He founded ''ALECOS'', a club destined to promote healthy lifestyles and [[alternative medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baca|first1=Carlos|title=Biografia|url=http://www.carlosbaca.mx/biografia.html|website=Carlos Baca|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
His authoritative texts about the counterculture are still being re-published in new books on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ponce|first1=Roberto|title=Presentan el libro "Rock en salsa verde", de Jorge H. Velasco|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=353896|accessdate=14 November 2014|agency=Proceso|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Avandaro, mas que drogas y desnudos|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/815718.html|accessdate=14 November 2014|agency=Notimex|publisher=El Universal|date=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the special occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Avandaro Festival, he was invited by his peers to an event named "Estrellas de Avandaro" (Avandaro stars) and received coverage by publications like the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rock|first1=Chava|title=40 aniversario de Avandaro|journal=Rolling Stone|date=12 September 2011|url=http://rollingstone.com.mx/noticias/40-aniversario-de-avandaro/|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arista|first1=Lidia|title=Venustiano Carranza celebra 40 aniversario de Avándaro|url=http://www.eluniversaldf.mx/venustianocarranza/nota33809.html|accessdate=14 November 2014|agency=El Universal|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Centre for Applied Genomics''' is a genome centre in the Research Institute of [[Sickkids|The Hospital for Sick Children]], and is affiliated with the [[University of Toronto]]. TCAG also operates as a Science and Technology Innovation Centre of [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genomecanada.ca/en/portfolio/science.aspx Genome Canada Science and Technology Platforms]&lt;/ref&gt; with an emphasis on [[next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) and [[bioinformatics]] support. Research at TCAG focuses on the [[genetics|genetic]] and genomic basis of human variability, health and disease, including research on the genetics of [[autism spectrum disorder]] and structural variation of the [[human genome]]. The Centre is located in the Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning in downtown [[Toronto]], Canada.

==History==
The need for a centralized core facility for human genome research at [[Sickkids|SickKids Hospital]] prompted the establishment of The Centre for Applied Genomics (TCAG) in 1998. The Founding Director and Associate Director were Drs. [[Lap-Chee Tsui]] and [[Stephen W. Scherer]], respectively. Dr. Scherer is now the Scientific Director.
[[Image:TCAG hall.jpg|left|320px|thumb|The Centre for Applied Genomics – MaRS location]]
Funding from the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI) enabled TCAG to form by consolidating existing core facilities including the [[Medical Research Council of Canada]] Genome Resource Facility, the [http://www.cgdn.ca/ Canadian Genetic Diseases Network] (CGDN) large insert clone core, the CGDN [[Dna sequencing|DNA Sequencing]] Core and the SickKids Biotechnology Service [[Dna sequencing|DNA Sequencing]] and Synthesis labs. A genome-wide [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] [[genotyping]] laboratory at the [[OHRI|Ottawa Health Research Institute]] led by Dr. Dennis  Bulman was added. Subsequently, operational funding from the [[CIHR]] Genomics Special Projects panel provided for additional staff.

In 2001, a proposal entitled "Genome Resource Core Platform" was submitted to the then newly formed [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada]. This provided operational support, enhancing existing facilities and adding a mouse [[genotyping]] core at the University of Toronto led by Dr. Lucy Osborne. In 2002, SickKids built a new [[Affymetrix]] [[microarray]] facility. This core has quickly grown to become the largest such service centre in Canada and is in the top ten in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Data provided by Affymetrix, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, TCAG entered a second phase of development driven by a $12 million [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]]/[http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/Home.html Ontario Innovation Trust] funded project entitled "Integrative Genomics for Health Research",&lt;ref&gt;Integrative Genomics for Health Research news item (Ontario Innovation Trust website) [http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/SStories21-40/StorySickKidsScherer.html]&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for consolidation of the mouse [[genotyping]] core with the SickKids facilities. This award also supported the establishment of an "Ontario Population Genomics Repository" (OPGP) to be used as controls in studies of common diseases. To efficiently complete this project, TCAG partnered with Dr. John McLaughlin's group at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto)]].

In May, 2004, an application to the newly announced [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]] Research Hospital Fund resulted in a $10.9 million award to build out lab space and consolidate all operations on the 14th and 15th floors of the Toronto Medical Discovery Tower (TMDT) in the [[MaRS Discovery District]]. TCAG was the first occupant of TMDT (in August, 2005), quickly followed by other SickKids scientists. Investments in computer infrastructure from the 2003 [[Canada Foundation for Innovation|CFI]]/[http://www.oit.on.ca/Pages/Home.html Ontario Innovation Trust] competition resulted in the establishment of new phases of the [http://ccb.sickkids.ca/hpf_index.html high-performance computing cluster] (HPF) that is currently used by TCAG and many other users, to allow analysis of large [[genomic]] datasets arising from new [[Dna microarray|microarray]] and [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] technologies. Further enhancements to the TCAG infrastructure were supported by a $10.7 million renewal grant from CFI's Leading Edge Fund competition, entitled "Integrative Genomics for Health Research&amp;nbsp;– Phase II",  awarded in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/News-Room/Past-News/2009/cfi-funding.html SickKids press release, June 18, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a CFI grant entitled "The Centre for Applied Genomics: Paediatric Genomes to Outcomes" provided further infrastructure support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/Newsroom/Past-News/2013/Leading-Edge-Fund-grants.html SickKids kicks off 2013 with two Leading Edge Fund grants, January 13, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, TCAG moved to the Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, a new building housing the SickKids Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcag.ca/news/news130930.html The Centre for Applied Genomics has moved - news item, TCAG website, October 229, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

TCAG operates in large part on Science and Technology Innovation Centre (STIC) funds from [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada], administered by the [http://www.ontariogenomics.ca Ontario Genomics Institute].

==Research==
Current research at TCAG centres around large-scale projects performed by facility personnel, including support of [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada] projects, and a significant focus on the genetics of [[autism spectrum disorder]]s and structural variation of the [[human genome]]. Service work is also performed for over 600 other academic, private sector and government labs each year, drawn from 30 different countries and spanning a wide variety of research disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Data from progress reports submitted to the Ontario Genomics Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Past research at TCAG is reflected by numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications. In 2008, TCAG Scientific Directors, Associate Scientists and staff co-authored 58 peer-reviewed manuscripts dependent in some way (either entirely, or in part) on the platform infrastructure, as documented in [[Pubmed|PubMed]].&lt;ref&gt;PubMed search for publications authored by these individuals during calendar year 2008, excluding Dr. Brudno who was added in 2009 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, over 270 such papers have been published.&lt;ref&gt;PubMed search for publications authored by these individuals, 2002 through present, excluding Drs. Brudno and Beyene who were added more recently [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support of other researchers worldwide is found in many similar publications, with at least 145 papers in scholarly journals, book chapters, or graduate thesis dissertations acknowledging support or use of database resources during 2008 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Google Scholar full-text search results:  publications referring to The Centre for Applied Genomics or the Database of Genomic Variants, either in the Acknowledgments section or body text, and published either electronically or in print. Strategies used were: "TCAG" (ignoring hits from other TCAG acronyms and various DNA sequences), "The Centre for Applied Genomics", American spelling, "The Center for Applied Genomics" (ignoring hits from facilities with similar names), "DGV", "Database of Genomic Variants", "Data Base of Genomic Variants" (including hits from the hyphenated form, "Data-base"), "Toronto Database" (ignoring non-relevant hits from non-DGV databases).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core Facilities==
[[Image:TCAG lab.jpg|right|320px|thumb|TCAG DNA Synthesis Facility]]
TCAG employs a variety of genomic technologies to support different types of experimentation. These are organized into separate Core Facilities, with dedicated managers.

===Informatics and Biostatistics===
The [[Bioinformatics]] team assists with data handling and analysis, and develops new algorithms and analytical methods, with a focus on the analysis of high-throughput ("next-generation") sequencing data. The Statistical Analysis group provides project consultation and [[Statistical power|power analysis]], statistical analysis ([[Genetics|genetic]], [[DNA microarray|microarray]], and [[Biochemical pathway|pathway]] data, [[epidemiology]], [[population genetics]]), and [[copy number variation]] analysis, as well as developing new statistical methods.

===DNA Sequencing and Synthesis===
The facility uses conventional capillary [[Sanger sequencing]] on [[Applied Biosystems]] 3730xl instruments, governed by a [[Lims|Laboratory Information Management System]] (LIMS). Additionally, [[next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) using [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] HiSeq 2500 and HiScan SQ instruments, [[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]] Ion Proton and [[Applied Biosystems]] SOLiD instruments, and a [[454 Life Sciences|454]]/[[Roche Diagnostics|Roche]] GS-FLX Titanium instrument is performed. A key component of this facility is the use of high-performance computing and [[bioinformatics]] support for NGS analysis.

The [[Oligonucleotide#Synthesis|Oligonucleotide Synthesis]] component of this facility makes conventional, long (up to 120 [[DNA base|bases]]) and modified [[oligonucleotide]]s, and purifies these by desalting, cartridge or high-performance liquid chromatography ([[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]]).

===Microarray and Genetic Analysis===
The [[Microarray]] and Gene Expression Core Facility has a dedicated manager, and operates technologies from [[Affymetrix]], [[Agilent]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]]. Additionally, there is a wide variety of analytical [[software]] packages available for on-site data analysis.

===Cytogenomics and Genome Resources===
The Cytogenomics and Genome Resources Core Facility has a single manager between these two functions. Cytogenomics includes karyotyping and spectral (SKY) [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] (for [[mouse]], human, and other species), fluorescent ''in situ'' hybridization ([[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]]) mapping, transgenic insertion site mapping (G-to-FISH mapping) and clone labeling for [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]] experiments. The Genome Resources components includes a clone repository (Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) [[cDNA]] ([[mouse]] and human), genomic clones including human [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s (BACs)) and provides project consultation and design assistance ([[Annotation#Computational biology|annotation]], database [[Information retrieval|queries]], probe selection). It also provides [[Cdna library|cDNA library]] screening and [[quantitative PCR]].

===Genetic Analysis===
The Genetic Analysis area includes capillary-based [[genotyping]] ([[Applied Biosystems]] [[TaqMan]] and SNaPshot, [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]]s), custom [[genotyping]] (e.g. [[heteroduplex]] analysis), [[mouse]] genotyping (for cross progeny and [[genetic linkage]] analysis), and [[methylation]] analysis (for [[epigenetics]] research).

===Biobanking===
The Biobanking Core Facility has its own dedicated manager. It performs [[White blood cell|white cell]] immortalization (from blood) and banking, [[fibroblast]] [[Cell culture|culture]] and banking, culture and banking of other cell types including non-human cells, [[Nuclear DNA|genomic DNA]] preparation from blood, [[saliva]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] or [[Cell (biology)|cells]], and [[Whole genome amplification|whole-genome amplification]] (WGA).

==Funding sources==
TCAG is funded by several agencies, including the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI), [http://www.genomecanada.ca Genome Canada] through the [http://www.ontariogenomics.ca Ontario Genomics Institute], the [[Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation]]. Additionally, philanthropic donations are administered by [[Sickkids|The Hospital for Sick Children]] Foundation, and specific research projects are funded by a wide variety of agencies and charitable foundations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">A '''community hospital''' can be purely a nominal designation or have a more specific meaning. When specific, it refers to a [[hospital]] that is accessible to the general public, and provides a general or specific medical care which is usually short-term, in a cost-effective setting, and also focuses on preventing illnesses and not only treating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is the Community Hospital a Dying Model, or is it the Future of Healthcare?|url=http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/is-the-community-hospital-a-dying-model-or-is-it-the-future-of-healthcare.html|publisher=Becker's Hospital Review and ASC Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fast Facts on US Hospitals|url=http://www.aha.org/research/rc/stat-studies/fast-facts.shtml|publisher=The American Hospital Association.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Psychological Association (APA):  community hospital. (n.d.). Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon. Retrieved July 21, 2013|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/community+hospital}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following countries have specified definitions for a community hospital:

== Thailand ==
{{main|Hospitals in Thailand}}
In Thailand, ''community hospital'' is a specific classification of public hospitals with a capacity of 150 beds or fewer. They serve local populations in provincial districts, providing [[primary care]].

== United Kingdom ==
An older term "cottage hospital" is now no longer applicable, having falling from use because it inadequately describes the wide range of services being offered by their more modern equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Hospital  |url=http://www.rcn.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/287732/05-07_Community_Hospitals_Toolkit.pdf |publisher=Royal College of Nursing|date= March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years the development of community hospitals was ad hoc, reflecting history rather than any rational planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heaney|first=David |title=Community hospitals – the place of local service provision in a modernising NHS: an integrative thematic literature |journal=BMC Public Health |date=2006 |volume=6 |page=309 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-6-309 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/6/309 |pmid=17184517 |pmc=1769373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== England ===
The (non-statutory) phrase is used in England in a similar manner to Scotland. Actual arrangements will be under legislation applicable to the English [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]].

===Northern Ireland===
In Northern Ireland the phrase has similar use to Scotland but official publications give the appearance of ''community hospitals'' being more recent as a concept rather than a mere description.

===Scotland===
"Community Hospital" is not a [[statutory]] phrase but it is often used where there is "a  unit or centre providing an appropriate range and format of accessible health care facilities and resources".&lt;ref&gt;Richie LD, Community hospitals in Scotland; promoting progress, Department of General Practice and Primary Care, University of Aberdeen, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Medical care is normally led by [[General practitioner|GPs]], in liaison with [[consultant (medicine)|consultant]], [[nurse|nursing]] and [[allied health professions|allied health professional colleagues]] as necessary. These hospitals are typically small, using either purpose-built new premises or smaller [[Hospital#Types|general hospitals]] which have been retained to provide non-emergency services after general hospital services have been transferred to more centralised facilities; in some cases the services include [[in-patient]] care. Community hospitals can assist multidisciplinary working and can be used as an extended primary care resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/924/0012112.pdf |title=Building a Health Service Fit for the Future Volume 2: A Guide for the NHS |pages=169–170 |publisher=Scottish Government |date=23 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community hospitals provide over 2,900 inpatient beds and over 750,000 outpatient, allied health professional and nurse led appointments. In many rural and remote communities this allows access to more specialised services and inpatient facilities closer to home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Hospitals: Strategy Refresh|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0039/00391837.pdf |publisher=Scottish Government|date=20 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wales===
The (non-statutory) phrase is used in Wales in a similar (but possibly less restricted) manner to Scotland. Some are named as community hospitals and many more are also listed as having this function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.nhs.uk/ourservices/directory/hospitals |title=Hospitals |publisher=NHS Wales |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some community hospitals have been chosen to act as a hub for services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/836/page/62496 |title=Hospitals in Communities |publisher=NHS Wales |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual arrangements will be under legislation applicable to [[NHS Wales]]/Gig Cymru.

== United States ==
The American Hospital Association (AHA) defines community hospitals as “all nonfederal, short-term general, and other special hospitals.” Health associations and hospital rating organizations, however, typically also say that [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospitals]] are not community hospitals. Some further restrict the community hospital definition to only include independently-run facilities serving a local demographic. A basic definition, therefore, is a hospital serving a local community, run by local leaders, providing financial opportunities for the local economy. A community hospital can be either rural or urban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The modern definition of a community hospital |url=https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/the-modern-definition-of-a-community-hospital.html |accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6440">{{For|the mathematical technique of solving a functional equation|Equating coefficients}}
'''Test equating''' traditionally refers to the statistical process of determining comparable scores on different forms of an [[exam]].&lt;ref name="KolenBrennan"&gt;Kolen, M.J., &amp; Brennan, R.L. (1995). Test Equating.  New York: Spring.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be accomplished using either [[classical test theory]] or [[item response theory]].

In item response theory, ''equating''&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorE&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of placing scores from two or more parallel test forms onto a common score scale. The result is that scores from two different test forms can be compared directly, or treated as though they came from the same test form. When the tests are not parallel, the general process is called linking. It is the process of equating the units and origins of two scales on which the abilities of students have been estimated from results on different tests. The process is analogous to equating degrees Fahrenheit with degrees Celsius by converting measurements from one scale to the other. The determination of comparable scores is a by-product of equating that results from equating the scales obtained from test results.

== Why is equating necessary? ==
Suppose that Dick and Jane both take a test to become licensed in a certain profession.  Because the [[High-stakes testing|high stakes]] (you get to practice the profession if you pass the test) may create a temptation to cheat, the organization that oversees the test creates two forms.  If we know that Dick scored 60% on form A and Jane scored 70% on form B, do we know for sure which one has a better grasp of the material?  What if form A is composed of very difficult items, while form B is relatively easy?  Equating analyses are performed to address this very issue, so that scores are as fair as possible.

== Equating in item response theory ==
[[image:Eq tests.PNG|thumb|400px|right|Figure 1: Test characteristic curves showing the relationship between total score and person location for two different tests in relation to a common scale. In this example a total of 37 on Assessment 1 equates to a total of 34.9 on Assessment 2 as shown by the vertical line]]
In [[item response theory]], person "locations" (measures of some quality being assessed by a test) are estimated on an [[interval scale]]; i.e., locations are estimated in relation to a unit and origin. It is common in educational assessment to employ tests in order to assess different groups of students with the intention of establishing a common scale by equating the origins, and when appropriate also the units, of the scales obtained from response data from the different tests. The process is referred to as equating or test equating.

In item response theory, two different kinds of equating are horizontal and vertical equating.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, F. (1983). Comparison of ability metrics obtained under two latent trait theory procedures. Applied Psychological Measurement, 7, 97-110.
&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical equating refers to the process of equating tests administered to groups of students with different abilities, such as students in different grades (years of schooling).&lt;ref&gt;Baker, F. (1984). Ability metric transformations involved in vertical equating under item response theory. Applied Psychological Measurement, 8(3), 261-271.&lt;/ref&gt; Horizontal equating refers the equating of tests administered to groups with similar abilities; for example, two tests administered to students in the same grade in two consecutive calendar years. Different tests are used to avoid practice effects.

In terms of item response theory, equating is just a special case of the more general process of ''scaling'', applicable when more than one test is used. In practice, though, scaling is often implemented separately for different tests and then the scales subsequently equated.

A distinction is often made between two methods of equating; ''common person'' and ''common item'' equating. Common person equating involves the administration of two tests to a common group of persons. The mean and standard deviation of the scale locations of the groups on the two tests are equated using a linear transformation. Common item equating involves the use of a set of common items referred to as the [[anchor test]] embedded in two different tests. The mean item location of the common items is equated.

== Classical approaches to equating ==
In classical test theory, mean equating simply adjusts the [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of scores so that the mean of one form is comparable to the mean of the other form.  While mean equating is attractive because of its simplicity, it lacks flexibility, namely accounting for the possibility that the standard deviations of the forms differ.&lt;ref name="KolenBrennan" /&gt;

Linear equating adjusts so that the two forms have a comparable [[mean]] and [[standard deviation]].  There are several types of linear equating that differ in the assumptions and mathematics used to estimate parameters.  The Tucker and Levine Observed Score methods estimate the relationship between observed scores on the two forms, while the Levine True Score method estimates the relationship between true scores on the two forms.&lt;ref name="KolenBrennan" /&gt;

Equipercentile equating determines the equating relationship as one where a score could have an equivalent [[percentile]] on either form.  This relationship can be nonlinear.

Unlike with item response theory, equating based on classical test theory is somewhat distinct from scaling.  Equating is a raw-to-raw transformation in that it estimates a raw score on Form B that is equivalent to each raw score on the base Form A.  Any scaling transformation used is then applied on top of, or with, the equating.

== A ==

* '''[[Activities of daily living]]'''
:: The tasks of everyday life. These activities include eating, dressing, getting into or out of a bed or chair, taking a bath or shower, and using the toilet. Instrumental activities of daily living are activities related to independent living and include preparing meals, managing money, shopping, doing housework, and using a telephone. Also called ADL. (NCI)

* '''[[Adverse drug reaction]]'''
:: In the preapproval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions. The phrase "responses to a medicinal product" means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. Regarding marketed medicinal products: A response to a drug that is noxious and unintended and that occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases or for modification of physiological function. (ICH E6)

* '''[[Adverse effect]]'''
:: An unwanted side effect of treatment. (NCI)

* '''[[Adverse event]]'''
:* An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy. Adverse events do not have to be caused by the drug or therapy, and they may be mild, moderate, or severe. (NCI)
:* An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (see the ICH guidance for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting). (ICH E6)

* '''[[Adverse reaction]]'''
:: An unwanted effect caused by the administration of drugs. Onset may be sudden or develop over time (NLM)

* '''[[Interest group|Advocacy]] and [[support group]]s'''
:: Organizations and groups that actively support participants and their families with valuable resources, including self-empowerment and survival tools. (NLM)

* '''[[Animal model]]'''
:: An animal with a disease either the same as or like a disease in humans. Animal models are used to study the development and progression of diseases and to test new treatments before they are given to humans. (NCI)

* '''[[Animal study]]'''
:: A laboratory experiment using animals to study the development and progression of diseases. Animal studies also test how safe and effective new treatments are before they are tested in people. (NCI)

* '''[[Approved drugs]]'''
:: In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve a substance as a drug before it can be marketed. The approval process involves several steps including pre-clinical laboratory and animal studies, clinical trials for safety and efficacy, filing of a New Drug Application by the manufacturer of the drug, FDA review of the application, and FDA approval/rejection of application (NLM)

* '''[[Arm]]'''
:: Any of the treatment groups in a randomized trial. Most randomized trials have two "arms," but some have three "arms," or even more (NLM)

* '''[[Audit]]'''
:: A systematic and independent examination of trial-related activities and documents to determine whether the evaluated trial-related activities were conducted, and the data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, sponsor's standard operating procedures (SOPs), good clinical practice (GCP), and the applicable regulatory requirement(s). (ICH E6)

* '''Audit certificate'''
:: A declaration of confirmation by the auditor that an audit has taken place. (ICH E6)

* '''[[Baseline (medicine)|Baseline]]'''
:* 1. Information gathered at the beginning of a study from which variations found in the study are measured. 2. A known value or quantity with which an unknown is compared when measured or assessed. 3. The initial time point in a clinical trial, just before a participant starts to receive the experimental treatment which is being tested. At this reference point, measurable values such as CD4 count are recorded. Safety and efficacy of a drug are often determined by monitoring changes from the baseline values. (NLM)
:* An initial measurement that is taken at an early time point to represent a beginning condition, and is used for comparison over time to look for changes. For example, the size of a tumor will be measured before treatment (baseline) and then afterwards to see if the treatment had an effect. (NCI)

* '''[[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]]''' approaches
:: Approaches to data analysis that provide a posterior probability distribution for some parameter (e.g. treatment effect), derived from the observed data and a prior probability distribution for the parameter. The posterior distribution is then used as the basis for statistical inference. (ICH E9)

:* A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are kept unaware of the treatment assignment(s). Single blinding usually refers to the subject(s) being unaware, and double blinding usually refers to the subject(s), investigator(s), monitor, and, in some cases, data analyst(s) being unaware of the treatment assignment(s). (ICH E6)

* '''Blind review'''

'''Hamish Watson''' [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh|FRCP]] (26 June 1923 - 23 May 2001), pioneer in [[pediatrics|paediatric]] [[Cardiac catheterization|cardiac catheterisation]].&lt;ref name="tel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hamish Watson |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1309117/Hamish-Watson.html |accessdate=6 August 2018 |agency=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=19 Jun 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson was most notable for being an authority on the [[congenital heart defect]], [[Ebstein's anomaly]].&lt;ref name="tel"/&gt;

== Early Life ==
Hamish Watson was born in Edinburgh to dairy owner John T R Watson and his wife, Annie Ewing Spence&lt;ref name="munk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/5226|title=Munks Roll Details for  Hamish Watson|website=munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He was educated at [[George Watson's College|George Watson's School]] before studying medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|University of Edinburgh]], from where he graduated with an [[MB ChB]] and an MD in 1945.

In 1951, he married Lesley Wood and had two daughters and a son.&lt;ref name="tel"/&gt;

== Career ==
Following his graduation, Watson spent his national service in Africa as RMO, [[Nigeria Regiment]]. Watson  returned to Edinburgh with a small collection of animals bound for the zoo.  His medical career continued at the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] where he was strongly influenced by cardiologist [[Andrew Rae Gilchrist]], who established the cardiology department at the Infirmary. Two years later, moved to [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews University]] Department of Medicine under Sir Ian Hill&lt;ref name="munk"/&gt;, working in Dundee hospitals.  Watson's early research was in the field of anticoagulant therapy but the tragic death of his young son from severe [[Congenital heart defect|congenital heart disease]], provided the impetus for him to undertake pioneering research work in congenital heart disease in children.  From this, Watson developed a diagnostic and treatment technique which involved insertion of narrow tubes into the heart - cardiac catheterisation. Watson  went on to establish the first coronary care unit in Tayside, and was appointed both Post-graduate Dean at the [[University of Dundee]] and head of the Cardiology Department at [[Dundee Royal Infirmary]].  Watson was editor of the 1968 multi-authored book, ''[[Paediatric Cardiology]]'' which became a standard text for students&lt;ref name="tel"/&gt;. Watson was influential in the establishment of the [[European Association of Paediatric Cardiologists]], becoming its first president&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dundee.ac.uk/museum/exhibitions/medical/cardiology/cardiology3/|title=Cardiac Catheterisation and Cardiac Surgery : Museum : University of Dundee|last=Dundee|first=University of|website=www.dundee.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Watson was also a Fellow of the [[American College of Cardiology]], and in 1987, joint chairman of the [[British Cardiac Society]] and a trustee of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

== Later Life ==
Following his retirement, Watson pursued his love of the great outdoors, hunting and fishing regularly.  He was a joint Master of Fox Hounds and, like his wife, an expert fly fisher. The Watsons were also keen gardeners.  A car accident brought this outdoors lifestyle to an abrupt halt however, leaving Watson paralysed and in great pain. He was nursed by his wife and died in 2001, at the age of 77, from [[pneumonia]] in the coronary care unit he had helped establish&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12227527.Dr_Hamish_Watson_Innovative_cardiologist_who_was_most_at__home_when_he_was_in_the_countryside/|title=Dr Hamish Watson Innovative cardiologist who was most at  home when he was in the countryside|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27771">'''Hospital-acquired pneumonia''' ('''HAP''') or '''nosocomial pneumonia''' refers to any [[pneumonia]] contracted by a patient in a [[hospital]] at least 48–72 hours after being admitted. It is thus distinguished from [[community-acquired pneumonia]]. It is usually caused by a [[Bacterial pneumonia|bacterial infection]], rather than a [[viral pneumonia|virus]].&lt;ref name="Mandell"&gt;

HAP is the second most common [[nosocomial infection]] (after [[urinary tract infection]]s) and accounts for 15–20% of the total.&lt;ref name="Mandell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;[http://books.mcgraw-hill.com/medical/harrisons/ Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804162006/http://books.mcgraw-hill.com/medical/harrisons/ |date=2012-08-04 }} 16th Edition, The [[McGraw-Hill]] Companies, {{ISBN|0-07-140235-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most common cause of death among nosocomial infections and is the primary cause of death in [[intensive care unit]]s.&lt;ref name="Mandell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;

HAP typically lengthens a hospital stay by 1–2 weeks.&lt;ref name="Mandell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
New or progressive infiltrate on the chest X-ray with one of the following:&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;
* [[Fever]] &gt; 37.8&amp;nbsp;°C (100&amp;nbsp;°F)
* Purulent sputum
* [[Leukocytosis]] &gt; 10,000 cells/μl
In an elderly person, the first sign of hospital-acquired pneumonia may be mental changes or confusion.
Other symptoms may include:
*A cough with greenish or pus-like phlegm (sputum)
*Fever and chills
*General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)
*Loss of appetite
*Nausea and vomiting
*Sharp chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing or coughing
*Shortness of breath
*Decreased blood pressure and fast heart rate&lt;ref&gt;medlineplus.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventilator-associated pneumonia===
{{see also|Ventilator-associated pneumonia}}
'''Ventilator-associated pneumonia''' ('''VAP''') is a sub-type of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) which occurs in people who are receiving mechanical ventilation. VAP is not characterized by the causative agents; rather, as its name implies, definition of VAP is restricted to patients undergoing mechanical ventilation while in a hospital. A positive culture after intubation is indicative of ventilator-associated pneumonia and is diagnosed as such. In order to appropriately categorize the causative agent or mechanism it is usually recommended to obtain a culture prior to initiating mechanical ventilation as a reference.

===Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP)===

HCAP is a condition in patients who can come from the community, but have frequent contact with the healthcare environment. Historically, the etiology and prognosis of nursing home pneumonia appeared to differ from other types of community acquired pneumonia, with studies reporting a worse prognosis and higher incidence of multi drug resistant organisms as etiology agents. The definition criteria which has been used is the same as the one which has been previously used to identify bloodstream healthcare associated infections.

HCAP is no longer recognized as a clinically independent entity. This is due to increasing evidence from a growing number of studies that many patients defined as having HCAP are not at high risk for MDR pathogens. As a result, 2016 IDSA guidelines removed consideration of HCAP as a separate clinical entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 IDSA guidelines|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/07/06/cid.ciw353.full.pdf|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition====
Healthcare-associated pneumonia can be defined as pneumonia in a patient with at least one of the following risk factors:
* hospitalization in an acute care [[hospital]] for two or more days in the last 90 days;
* residence in a nursing home or long-term care facility in the last 30 days
* receiving outpatient [[intravenous]] therapy (like [[antibiotics]] or [[chemotherapy]]) within the past 30 days

====Causes====
In some studies, the bacteria found in patients with HCAP were more similar to HAP than to CAP; compared to CAP, they could have higher rates of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (''S. aureus'') and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', and less ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''. In European and Asian studies, the etiology of HCAP was similar to that of CAP, and rates of multi drug resistant pathogens such as ''Staphylococcus aureus'' and ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' were not as high as seen in North American studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brito|first=V|author2=Niederman M|title=Healthcare-associated pneumonia is a heterogeneous disease, and all patients do not need the same broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy as complex nosocomial pneumonia|journal=Curr Opin Infect Dis|year=2009|issue=22|pages=316–325|doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e328329fa4e}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chalmers|first=JD|author2=Rother C |author3=Salih W |author4=Ewig S. |title=Healthcare-associated pneumonia does not accurately identify potentially resistant pathogens: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Clin Infect Dis|year=2014|volume=58|pages=330–9|doi=10.1093/cid/cit734}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well known that nursing home residents have high rates of [[Colonization (biology)|colonization]] with MRSA. However, not all studies have found high rates of S. aureus and [[gram-negative bacteria]].&lt;ref name="LTCF-pneumonia"/&gt; One factor responsible for these differences is the reliance on sputum samples and the strictness of the criteria to discriminate 
between colonising or disease-causing bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid16823991"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mylotte JM |title=Nursing home-acquired pneumonia: update on treatment options |journal=Drugs Aging |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=377–90 |year=2006 |pmid=16823991 |doi= 10.2165/00002512-200623050-00002|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, sputum samples might be less frequently obtained in the elderly.&lt;ref name="pmid15526736"/&gt;[[Aspiration pneumonia|Aspiration]] (both of microscopic drops and macroscopic amounts of [[nasopharynx|nose and throat]] secretions) is thought to be the most important cause of HCAP.

Bacteria have been the most commonly isolated pathogens, although viral and fungal pathogens are potentially found in immunocompromised hosts (patients on chronic immunosuppressed medications, solid organ and bone marrow transplant recipients). In general, the distribution of microbial pathogens varies among institutions, partly because of differences in patient population and local patterns of anti microbial resistance in hospitals and critical care units'&lt;ref&gt;clevelandcliniceded.com&lt;/ref&gt; Common bacterial pathogens include aerobic GNB, such as ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'', ''Acinetobacter baumanii'', ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'', ''Escherichia coli'' as well as gram-positive organisms such as ''Staphylococcus aureus''. In patients with an early onset pneumonia (within 5 days of hospitalization), they are usually due to anti microbial-sensitive bacteria such as ''Enterobacter'' spp, ''E. coli'', ''Klebsiella'' spp, ''Proteus'' spp, ''Serratia mare scans'', community pathogens such as ''Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae'', and methicillin-sensitive ''S. aureus'' should also be considered.&lt;ref&gt;Rouille the JL. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: an comprehensive review. Hosp Pract (Minneap) 2012; 40:165–175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(clevelandclinicmeded.com)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pneumonia that starts in the hospital tends to be more serious than other lung infections because: people in the hospital are often very sick and cannot fight off germs. The types of germs present in a hospital are often more dangerous and more resistant to treatment than those outside in the community. Pneumonia occurs more often in people who are using a respirator. This machine helps them breathe. Hospital-acquired pneumonia can also be spread by health care workers, who can pass germs from their hands or clothes from one person to another. This is why hand-washing, wearing grows, and using other safety measures is so important in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;(Medlineplus.gov)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Patients with HCAP are more likely than those with community-acquired pneumonia to receive inappropriate antibiotics that do not target the bacteria causing their disease.

In 2002, an expert panel made recommendations about the evaluation and treatment of probable nursing home-acquired pneumonia.&lt;ref name="pmid12184969"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutt E, Kramer AM |title=Evidence-based guidelines for management of nursing home-acquired pneumonia |journal=J Fam Pract |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=709–16 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12184969 |doi= |url=http://www.jfponline.com/Pages.asp?AID=1275}}&lt;/ref&gt; They defined probably pneumonia, emphasized expedite antibiotic treatment (which is known to improve survival) and drafted criteria for the hospitalization of willing patients.

For initial treatment in the nursing home, a [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotic suitable for respiratory infections ([[moxifloxacin]], for example), or [[amoxicillin with clavulanic acid]] plus a [[macrolide]] has been suggested.&lt;ref name="pmid16823991"/&gt; In a hospital setting, injected ([[parenteral]]) fluoroquinolones or a second- or third-generation [[cephalosporin]] plus a macrolide could be used.&lt;ref name="pmid16823991"/&gt; Other factors that need to be taken into account are recent antibiotic therapy (because of possible resistance caused by recent exposure), known carrier state or risk factors for resistant organisms (for example, known carrier of MRSA or presence of [[bronchiectasis]] predisposing to [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]), or suspicion of possible [[Legionella pneumophila]] infection (legionnaires disease).&lt;ref name="TVG.be"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Depuydt P, Vogelaers D |title=Nosocomial pneumonia outside the hospital: health-care associated pneumonia and nursing home pneumonia |journal=Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde (Belgium) |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=174–181 |year=2007 |doi=10.2143/TVG.63.05.2000033 |url=|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[American Thoracic Society]] and [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] have published guidelines suggesting antibiotics specifically for HCAP.&lt;ref name="guidelines"&gt;{{cite journal |author=American Thoracic Society |author2=Infectious Diseases Society of America |title=Guidelines for the management of adults with hospital-acquired, ventilator-associated, and healthcare-associated pneumonia |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=388–416 |year=2005 |pmid=15699079 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200405-644ST}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines recommend combination therapy with an agent from each of the following groups to cover for both ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' and MRSA. This is based on studies using [[sputum]] samples and [[intensive care]] patients, in whom these bacteria were commonly found.
* [[cefepime]], [[ceftazidime]], [[imipenem]], [[meropenem]] or [[Piperacillin/tazobactam|piperacillin–tazobactam]]; plus
* [[ciprofloxacin]], [[levofloxacin]], [[amikacin]], [[gentamicin]], or [[tobramycin]]; plus
* [[linezolid]] or [[vancomycin]]

In one observational study, empirical antibiotic treatment that was not according to international treatment guidelines was an independent predictor of worse outcome among HCAP patients.&lt;ref name="pmid19124816"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Venditti M, Falcone M, Corrao S, Licata G, Serra P |title=Outcomes of patients hospitalized with community-acquired, health care-associated, and hospital-acquired pneumonia |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=150 |issue=1 |pages=19–26 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19124816 |doi= 10.7326/0003-4819-150-1-200901060-00005|url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19124816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guidelines from Canada suggest that HCAP can be treated like community-acquired pneumonia with antibiotics targeting [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]], based on studies using [[blood culture]]s in different settings which have not found high rates of MRSA or Pseudomonas.&lt;ref name="pmid15993675"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grossman RF, Rotschafer JC, Tan JS |title=Antimicrobial treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in the hospital setting |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=118 Suppl 7A |issue= 7|pages=29S–38S |date=July 2005 |pmid=15993675 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.05.011 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002-9343(05)00385-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides prompt antibiotic treatment, supportive measure for organ failure (such as [[heart failure|cardiac decompensation]]) are also important. Another consideration goes to hospital referral; although more severe pneumonia requires admission to an acute care facility, this also predisposes to hazards of hospitalization such as [[delirium]], [[urinary incontinence]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[falls in older adults|falls]], restraint use, functional decline, [[adverse drug effect]]s and [[nosocomial infection|hospital infections]].&lt;ref name="pmid18299494"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fernandez HM, Callahan KE, Likourezos A, Leipzig RM |title=House staff member awareness of older inpatients' risks for hazards of hospitalization |journal=Arch.

====Prognosis====
Healthcare-associated pneumonia seems to have [[fatality rate]]s similar to hospital-acquired pneumonia, worse than community-acquired pneumonia but less severe than pneumonia in ventilated patients.&lt;ref name="Chest2005"/&gt; Besides clinical markers like [[tachypnea]] (fast breathing) or a high white cell count ([[leukocytosis]]), the prognosis seems to be influenced by the underlying associated diseases ([[comorbidity|comorbidities]]) and functional capacities (for example, the [[Activities of daily living|ADL score]]).&lt;ref name="pmid9789516"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mehr DR, Zweig SC, Kruse RL, etal |title=Mortality from lower respiratory infection in nursing home residents.

====Epidemiology====
Several studies found that healthcare-associated pneumonia is the second most common type of pneumonia, occurring less commonly than community-acquired pneumonia but more frequently than hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia. In a recent observational study, the rates for CAP, HCAP and HAP were 60%, 25% and 15% respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid19124816"/&gt; Patients with HCAP are older and more commonly have simultaneous health problems (such as previous [[stroke]], [[heart failure]] and [[diabetes]]).&lt;ref name="Chest2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kollef MH, Shorr A, Tabak YP, Gupta V, Liu LZ, Johannes RS |title=Epidemiology and outcomes of health-care-associated pneumonia: results from a large US database of culture-positive pneumonia |journal=Chest |volume=128 |issue=6 |pages=3854–62 |year=2005 |pmid=16354854 |doi=10.1378/chest.128.6.3854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of residents in long term care facilities is expected to rise dramatically over the next 30 years. These older adults are known to develop pneumonia 10 times more than their community-dwelling peers, and hospital admittance rates are 30 times higher.&lt;ref name="LTCF-pneumonia"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Muder RR |title=Pneumonia in residents of long-term care facilities: epidemiology, etiology, management, and prevention |journal=Am.

====Nursing home-acquired pneumonia====
Nursing home-acquired pneumonia is an important subgroup of HCAP. Residents of long term care facilities may become infected through their contacts with the healthcare system; as such, the [[microbe]]s responsible for their pneumonias may be different from those traditionally seen in community-dwelling patients, requiring therapy with different [[antibiotics]]. Other groups include patients who are admitted as a day case for regular [[hemodialysis]] or [[intravenous infusion]] (for example, [[chemotherapy]]). Especially in the very old and in [[dementia|demented]] patients, HCAP is likely to present with atypical symptoms.&lt;ref name="pmid15021052"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Loeb M |title=Pneumonia in the elderly |journal=Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=127–30 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15021052 |doi= 10.1097/00001432-200404000-00010|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0951-7375&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11037021"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson JC, Jayadevappa R, Baccash PD, Taylor L |title=Nonspecific presentation of pneumonia in hospitalized older people: age effect or dementia? |journal=J Am Geriatr Soc |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=1316–20 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11037021 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk factors ==
Among the factors contributing to contracting HAP are [[mechanical ventilation]] ([[ventilator-associated pneumonia]]), old age, decreased filtration of inspired air, intrinsic respiratory, neurologic, or other disease states that result in respiratory tract obstruction, trauma, (abdominal) surgery, medications, diminished [[lung volumes]], or decreased clearance of secretions may diminish the defenses of the lung.  Also, poor hand-washing and inadequate disinfection of respiratory devices cause cross-infection and are important factors.&lt;ref name="Mandell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;

== Pathogenesis ==
Most nosocomial respiratory infections are caused by so-called skorvatch microaspiration of upper airway secretions, through inapparent [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]], into the lower respiratory tract. Also, "macroaspirations" of esophageal or gastric material is known to result in HAP.  Since it results from aspiration either type is called [[aspiration pneumonia]].&lt;ref name="Mandell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;

Although [[gram-negative bacilli]] are a common cause they are rarely found in the respiratory tract of people without pneumonia, which has led to speculation of the mouth and throat as origin of the infection.&lt;ref name="Mandell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Pneumonia x-ray.jpg|thumb|'''Pneumonia as seen on chest x-ray.'''
''A'': Normal chest x-ray. ''B'': Abnormal chest x-ray with shadowing from pneumonia in the right lung (left side of image).]]
In hospitalised patients who develop respiratory symptoms and fever, one should consider the diagnosis.  The likelihood increases when upon investigation symptoms are found of [[respiratory insufficiency]], purulent secretions, newly developed infiltrate on the [[chest X-Ray]], and increasing [[leucocytosis|leucocyte count]].  If pneumonia is suspected material from sputum or tracheal aspirates are sent to the microbiology department for cultures.  In case of [[pleural effusion]] [[thoracentesis]] is performed for examination of [[pleural fluid]].  In suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia it has been suggested that [[bronchoscopy]]([[Bronchoalveolar lavage|BAL]]) is necessary because of the known risks surrounding clinical diagnoses.&lt;ref name="Mandell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===
* [[Atelectasis]]
* [[Congestive heart failure]]
* [[Pulmonary embolism]]

== Treatment ==
Usually initial therapy is empirical.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; If sufficient reason to suspect [[influenza]], one might consider [[oseltamivir]]. In case of [[legionellosis]], [[erythromycin]] or [[fluoroquinolone]].&lt;ref name="Mandell"/&gt;

A third generation [[cephalosporin]] ([[ceftazidime]]) + [[carbapenems]] ([[imipenem]]) + [[beta lactam]] &amp; [[beta lactamase inhibitor]]s ([[piperacillin]]/[[tazobactam]])

The '''human eye''' is an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] which reacts to [[light]] and pressure. As a [[Sensory system|sense organ]], the [[mammalian eye]] allows [[Visual perception|vision]]. Human eyes help to provide a three dimensional, moving image, normally coloured in daylight. [[Rod cell|Rod]] and [[Cone cell|cone]] cells in the [[retina]] allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth.

Similar to the [[Mammalian eye|eyes of other mammals]], the human eye's non-image-forming [[photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina receive light signals which affect adjustment of the size of the pupil, regulation and suppression of the hormone [[melatonin]] and [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the [[circadian rhythm|body clock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://discovermagazine.com/2012/jan-feb/12-the-brain-our-strange-light-detector/article_view?b_start:int=0&amp;-C= | title= Our Strange, Important, Subconscious Light Detectors |accessdate= 2012-05-05 |last= Zimmer |first= Carl |date=February 2012 |publisher= Discover Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
[[File:Human eye with blood vessels.jpg|thumb|Blood vessels can be seen within the sclera, as well as a strong limbal ring around the iris.]][[File:Gray892.png|thumb|The outer parts of the eye.|208x208px]]
The eye is not shaped like a perfect sphere, rather it is a fused two-piece unit, composed of the anterior segment and the posterior segment. The anterior segment is made up of the cornea, iris and lens. The cornea is transparent and more curved, and is linked to the larger posterior segment, composed of the vitreous, retina, choroid and the outer white shell called the sclera. The cornea is typically about 11.5&amp;nbsp;mm (0.3&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter, and 1/2&amp;nbsp;mm (500&amp;nbsp;μm) in thickness near its center. The posterior chamber constitutes the remaining five-sixths; its diameter is typically about 24&amp;nbsp;mm. The cornea and sclera are connected by an area termed the limbus. The iris is the pigmented circular structure concentrically surrounding the center of the eye, the pupil, which appears to be black. The size of the pupil, which controls the amount of light entering the eye, is adjusted by the iris' [[iris dilator muscle|dilator]] and [[iris sphincter muscle|sphincter muscle]]s.

Light energy enters the eye through the cornea, through the pupil and then through the lens. The lens shape is changed for near focus (accommodation) and is controlled by the ciliary muscle. Photons of light falling on the light-sensitive cells of the retina ([[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor cones and rods]]) are converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve and interpreted as sight and vision.

=== Size ===
{{See also|Mammalian eye}}
{{Confusing section|reason=it contains many technical terms confusing to average reader|date=April 2018}}Dimensions typically differ among adults by only one or two millimetres, remarkably consistent across different ethnicities. The vertical measure, generally less than the horizontal, is about 24&amp;nbsp;mm. The transverse size of a human adult eye is approximately 24.2&amp;nbsp;mm and the sagittal size is  23.7&amp;nbsp;mm with no significant difference between sexes and age groups. Strong correlation has been found between the transverse diameter and the width of the orbit (r = 0.88).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubfacts.com/detail/25431659/Variations-in-eyeball-diameters-of-the-healthy-adults |title=Variations in eyeball diameters of the healthy adults}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical adult eye has an anterior to posterior diameter of 24 millimetres, a volume of six cubic centimetres (0.4 cu. in.),&lt;ref name=GeneralOphthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=edited by Paul Riordan-Eva, Emmett T.|title=Vaughan &amp; Asbury's General Ophthalmology|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-163420-5|url=http://accessmedicine.com/resourceTOC.aspx?resourceID=720|edition=18th|date=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a mass of 7.5 grams (weight of 0.25 oz.).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

The eyeball grows rapidly, increasing from about 16–17 millimetres (about 0.65&amp;nbsp;inch) at birth to 22.5–23&amp;nbsp;mm (approx. 0.89 in) by three years of age. By age 13, the eye attains its full size.

=== Components ===
[[File:Schematic diagram of the human eye en.svg|thumb|250px|Schematic diagram of the human eye. It shows a horizontal section through the right eye.]]
The eye is made up of three coats, or layers, enclosing various anatomical structures. The outermost layer, known as the [[Fibrous tunic of eyeball|fibrous tunic]], is composed of the [[cornea]] and [[sclera]]. The middle layer, known as the [[Uvea|vascular tunic or uvea]], consists of the [[choroid]], [[ciliary body]], pigmented epithelium and [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. The innermost is the [[retina]], which gets its oxygenation from the blood vessels of the choroid (posteriorly) as well as the retinal vessels (anteriorly).

The spaces of the eye are filled with the [[aqueous humour]] anteriorly, between the cornea and lens, and the [[vitreous body]], a jelly-like substance, behind the lens, filling the entire posterior cavity. The aqueous humour is a clear watery fluid that is contained in two areas:  the [[Anterior chamber of eyeball|anterior chamber]] between the cornea and the iris, and the [[Posterior chamber of eyeball|posterior chamber]] between the iris and the lens. The lens is suspended to the ciliary body by the suspensory ligament ([[Zonule of Zinn]]), made up of hundreds of fine transparent fibers which transmit muscular forces to change the shape of the lens for accommodation (focusing). The vitreous body is a clear substance composed of water and proteins, which give it a jelly-like and sticky composition.&lt;ref&gt;"eye, human."Encyclopædia Britannica from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]] 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The approximate [[field of view]] of an individual human eye (measured from the fixation point, i.e., the point at which one's gaze is directed) varies by facial anatomy, but is typically 30° superior (up, limited by the brow), 45° nasal (limited by the nose), 70° inferior (down), and 100° temporal (towards the temple).&lt;ref name="SavinoDanesh-Meyer2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Savino|first1=Peter J.|last2=Danesh-Meyer|first2=Helen V.|title=Color Atlas and Synopsis of Clinical Ophthalmology – Wills Eye Institute – Neuro-Ophthalmology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RgSZGWQZGIC&amp;pg=PA12|date=2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-1-60913-266-8|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RyanSchachat2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Schachat|first2=Andrew P.|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Charles P. |author4=David R.

=== Dynamic range ===
The retina has a static [[contrast ratio]] of around 100:1 (about 6.5 [[F-number#Stops, f-stop conventions, and exposure|f-stops]]). As soon as the eye moves rapidly to acquire a target ([[saccade]]s), it re-adjusts its exposure by adjusting the iris, which adjusts the size of the pupil. Initial dark adaptation takes place in approximately four seconds of profound, uninterrupted darkness; full adaptation through adjustments in retinal rod photoreceptors is 80% complete in thirty minutes. The process is nonlinear and multifaceted, so an interruption by light exposure requires restarting the dark adaptation process over again. Full adaptation is dependent on good blood flow; thus dark adaptation may be hampered by retinal disease, poor vascular circulation and high altitude exposure. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The eye includes a [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] similar to [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] found in optical instruments such as cameras and the same physics principles can be applied. The [[pupil]] of the human [[eye]] is its [[aperture]]; the iris is the diaphragm that serves as the aperture stop. Refraction in the [[cornea]] causes the effective aperture (the [[entrance pupil]]) to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter. The entrance pupil is typically about 4&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, although it can range from 2&amp;nbsp;mm ({{f/|8.3|}}) in a brightly lit place to 8&amp;nbsp;mm ({{f/|2.1}}) in the dark.

The visual system in the human brain is too slow to process information if images are slipping across the retina at more than a few degrees per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westheimer | first1 = Gerald | last2 = McKee | first2 = Suzanne P | year = 1975 | title = Visual acuity in the presence of retinal-image motion | url = | journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America | volume = 65 | issue = 7| pages = 847–50 | doi=10.1364/josa.65.000847 | pmid=1142031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, to be able to see while moving, the brain must compensate for the motion of the head by turning the eyes. Frontal-eyed animals have a small area of the retina with very high visual acuity, the [[fovea centralis]]. It covers about 2 degrees of visual angle in people. To get a clear view of the world, the brain must turn the eyes so that the image of the object of regard falls on the fovea. Any failure to make eye movements correctly can lead to serious visual degradation.

Having two eyes allows the brain to determine the depth and distance of an object, called stereovision, and gives the sense of three-dimensionality to the vision. Both eyes must point accurately enough that the object of regard falls on corresponding points of the two retinas to stimulate stereovision; otherwise, double vision might occur. Some persons with congenitally crossed eyes tend to ignore one eye's vision, thus do not suffer double vision, and do not have stereovision. The movements of the eye are controlled by six muscles attached to each eye, and allow the eye to elevate, depress, converge, diverge and roll. These muscles are both controlled voluntarily and involuntarily to track objects and correct for simultaneous head movements.

=== Extraocular muscles ===
{{Main|Extraocular muscles}}
Each eye has six [[muscle]]s that control its movements: the [[Lateral rectus muscle|lateral rectus]], the [[Medial rectus muscle|medial rectus]], the [[Inferior rectus muscle|inferior rectus]], the [[Superior rectus muscle|superior rectus]], the [[Inferior oblique muscle|inferior oblique]], and the [[Superior oblique muscle|superior oblique]]. When the muscles exert different tensions, a torque is exerted on the globe that causes it to turn, in almost pure rotation, with only about one millimeter of translation.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Roger H.S. (1988) ''Movements of the eyes (2nd ed.)''. Pion Ltd, London. {{ISBN|0-85086-109-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the eye can be considered as undergoing rotations about a single point in the center of the eye.

=== Rapid eye movement ===
{{Main|Rapid eye movement sleep}}
Rapid eye movement, REM, typically refers to the [[sleep]] stage during  which the most vivid dreams occur. During this stage, the eyes move rapidly. It is not in itself a unique form of eye movement.

=== Saccades ===
{{Main|Saccade}}
Saccades are quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction controlled by the frontal lobe of the brain. Some irregular drifts, movements, smaller than a saccade and larger than a microsaccade, subtend up to one tenth of a degree.

=== Microsaccades ===
{{Main|Microsaccade}}

Even when looking intently at a single spot, the eyes drift around. This ensures that individual photosensitive cells are continually stimulated in different degrees. Without changing input, these cells would otherwise stop generating output. Microsaccades move the eye no more than a total of 0.2° in adult humans.

=== Vestibulo-ocular reflexes ===
{{Main|Vestibulo-ocular reflex}}
The [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] is a [[reflex]] eye movement that stabilizes images on the [[retina]] during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement in response to neural input from the vestibular system of the inner ear, thus maintaining the image in the center of the visual field. For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left.  This applies for head movements up and down, left and right, and tilt to the right and left, all of which give input to the ocular muscles to maintain visual stability.

=== Smooth pursuit movement ===
{{Main|Pursuit movement}}
Eyes can also follow a moving object around. This tracking is less accurate than the vestibulo-ocular reflex, as it requires the brain to process incoming visual information and supply [[feedback]]. Following an object moving at constant speed is relatively easy, though the eyes will often make saccadic jerks to keep up. The smooth pursuit movement can move the eye at up to 100°/s in adult humans.

It is more difficult to visually estimate speed in low light conditions or while moving, unless there is another point of reference for determining speed.

=== Optokinetic reflex ===
{{Main |Optokinetic response}}

The Optokinetic reflex (or optokinetic nystagmus) stabilizes the image on the retina through visual feedback. It is induced when the entire visual scene drifts across the retina, eliciting eye rotation in the same direction and at a velocity that minimizes the motion of the image on the retina. When the gaze direction deviates too far from the forward heading, a compensatory saccade is induced to reset the gaze to the centre of the visual field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0002055 |pmid=18446207|pmc=2323102|year=2008|last1=Cahill|first1=H|title=The Optokinetic Reflex as a Tool for Quantitative Analyses of Nervous System Function in Mice: Application to Genetic and Drug-Induced Variation|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=3|issue=4|pages=e2055|last2=Nathans|first2=J|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2055C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when looking out of the window at a moving train, the eyes can focus on a moving train for a short moment (by stabilizing it on the retina), until the train moves out of the field of vision. At this point, the eye is moved back to the point where it first saw the train (through a saccade).

== Near response ==
The adjustment to close-range vision involves three processes to focus an image on the retina.

=== Vergence movement ===
{{Main|Vergence}}
[[File:Stereogram Tut Eye Convergence.png|thumb|The two eyes converge to point to the same object.]]
When a creature with binocular vision looks at an object, the eyes must rotate around a vertical axis so that the projection of the image is in the centre of the retina in both eyes. To look at a nearby object, the eyes rotate 'towards each other' ([[convergence (eye)|convergence]]), while for an object farther away they rotate 'away from each other' ([[divergence (eye)|divergence]]).

=== Pupil constriction ===
Lenses cannot refract light rays at their edges as well as they can closer to the center. The image produced by any lens is therefore somewhat blurry around the edges (spherical aberration). It can be minimized by screening out peripheral light rays and looking only at the better-focused center. In the eye, the pupil serves this purpose by constricting while the eye is focused on nearby objects. Small apertures also give an increase in depth of field, allowing a broader range of "in focus" vision. In this way the pupil has a dual purpose for near vision: to reduce spherical aberration and increase depth of field.&lt;ref name=Saladin_A&amp;Punity&gt;{{cite book|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth S.|title=Anatomy &amp; physiology : the unity of form and function|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-337825-1|pages=620–622|edition=6th|date=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accommodation of the lens ===
Changing the curvature of the lens is carried out by the [[ciliary muscle]]s surrounding the lens; this process is called "accommodation". Accommodation narrows the inner diameter of the ciliary body, which actually relaxes the fibers of the suspensory ligament attached to the periphery of the lens, and allows the lens to relax into a more convex, or globular, shape. A more convex lens refracts light more strongly and focuses divergent light rays from near objects onto the retina, allowing closer objects to be brought into better focus.&lt;ref name=Saladin_A&amp;Punity /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human eye|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1688997/human-eye|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical significance ==

=== Eye care professionals ===
The human eye contains enough complexity to warrant specialized attention and care beyond the duties of a [[general practitioner]]. These specialists, or [[eye care professional]]s, serve different functions in different countries. Eye care professionals can have overlap in their patient care privileges.  For example, both an [[ophthalmologist]] (M.D.) and optometrist (O.D.) are professionals who diagnoses eye disease and can prescribe lenses to correct vision.  However, typically only ophthalmologists are licensed to perform surgical procedures.  Ophthalmologists may also specialize within a surgical area, such as [[Corneal transplantation|cornea]], [[Cataract surgery|cataracts]], [[Refractive surgery|laser]], [[Retinal detachment|retina]], or [[oculoplastics]].  Other eye care professionals include:
* [[Optometry|Optometrists]]
* [[Opticianry|Opticians]]
* [[Vision therapy|Vision Therapists]] and [[Orthoptics|Orthoptists]]
* [[Ocularist]]s

=== Eye irritation ===

Certain [[volatile organic compound]]s that are both chemically reactive and airway irritants may cause eye irritation. Personal factors (e.g. use of contact lenses, eye make-up, and certain medications) may also affect destabilization of the tear film and possibly result in more eye symptoms.&lt;ref name=Wolkoff /&gt; Nevertheless, if airborne particles alone should destabilize the tear film and cause eye irritation, their content of surface-active compounds must be high.&lt;ref name=Wolkoff /&gt; An integrated physiological risk model with [[blink]] frequency, destabilization, and break-up of the eye tear film as inseparable phenomena may explain eye irritation among office workers in terms of occupational, climate, and eye-related physiological risk factors.&lt;ref name=Wolkoff /&gt;

There are two major measures of eye irritation. One is blink frequency which can be observed by human behavior. The other measures are break up time, tear flow, hyperemia (redness, swelling), tear fluid cytology, and epithelial damage (vital stains) etc., which are human beings' physiological reactions. Blink frequency is defined as the number of blinks per minute and it is associated with eye irritation. Blink frequencies are individual with mean frequencies of &lt; 2-3 to 20-30 blinks/minute, and they depend on environmental factors including the use of [[contact lens]]es. Dehydration, mental activities, work conditions, room temperature, relative humidity, and illumination all influence blink frequency. Break-up time (BUT) is another major measure of eye irritation and tear film stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kjaergaard|first=SK|title=Indoor air quality handbook: Chapter 17, the Irritated Eye in the Indoor Environment|year=2001|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-445549-4|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is defined as the time interval (in seconds) between blinking and rupture. BUT is considered to reflect the stability of the tear film as well. In normal persons, the break-up time exceeds the interval between blinks, and, therefore, the tear film is maintained.&lt;ref name=Wolkoff /&gt; Studies have shown that blink frequency is correlated negatively with break-up time. This phenomenon indicates that perceived eye irritation is associated with an increase in blink frequency since the cornea and conjunctiva both have sensitive nerve endings that belong to the first trigeminal branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norn|first=Mogens S.|title=External eye : methods of examination|year=1974|publisher=Scriptor|location=Copenhagen|isbn=978-8787473033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sibony PA. et al. 1998, pp. 1509-1592"&gt;Sibony PA, Evinger C.

There are other factors that are related to eye irritation as well. Three major factors that influence the most are indoor air pollution, contact lenses and gender differences.

Acute incidence rates for nasal, eye, and [[throat irritation]], and coughing and breathlessness were found to be associated with increased exposure levels of both exposure indices.

=== Eye disease ===
{{Full explanation diagram of a human eye section}}
There are many [[Eye disease|diseases]], disorders, and [[Aging-associated diseases|age-related]] changes that may affect the eyes and surrounding structures.

As the eye ages, certain changes occur that can be attributed solely to the aging process. Most of these anatomic and physiologic processes follow a gradual decline. With aging, the quality of vision worsens due to reasons independent of diseases of the aging eye. While there are many changes of significance in the non-diseased eye, the most functionally important changes seem to be a reduction in pupil size and the loss of accommodation or focusing capability ([[presbyopia]]). The area of the pupil governs the amount of light that can reach the retina. The extent to which the pupil dilates decreases with age, leading to a substantial decrease in light received at the retina. In comparison to younger people, it is as though older persons are constantly wearing medium-density sunglasses. Therefore, for any detailed visually guided tasks on which performance varies with illumination, older persons require extra lighting. Certain ocular diseases can come from sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes and genital warts. If contact between the eye and area of infection occurs, the STD can be transmitted to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agingeye.net/ AgingEye Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913224350/http://www.agingeye.net/ |date=2008-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With aging, a prominent white ring develops in the periphery of the cornea called [[arcus senilis]]. Aging causes laxity, downward shift of eyelid tissues and atrophy of the orbital fat. These changes contribute to the etiology of several eyelid disorders such as [[ectropion]], [[entropion]], [[dermatochalasis]], and [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]. The vitreous gel undergoes liquefaction ([[posterior vitreous detachment]] or PVD) and its opacities — visible as [[floater]]s — gradually increase in number.

Various [[eye care professional]]s, including [[ophthalmologist]]s (eye doctors/surgeons), [[optometrist]]s, and [[optician]]s, are involved in the treatment and management of ocular and vision disorders. A [[Snellen chart]] is one type of [[eye chart]] used to measure [[visual acuity]]. At the conclusion of a complete [[eye examination]], the eye doctor might provide the patient with an [[eyeglass prescription]] for [[corrective lens]]es. Some disorders of the eyes for which corrective lenses are prescribed include [[myopia]] (near-sightedness) which affects about one-third{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} of the human population, [[hyperopia]] (far-sightedness) which affects about one quarter of the population, [[astigmatism]], and [[presbyopia]] (the loss of focusing range during aging).

Lutein and zeaxanthin bind to the electron free radical and are reduced rendering the electron safe. There are many ways to ensure a diet rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, the best of which is to eat dark green vegetables including kale, spinach, broccoli and turnip greens. Nutrition is an important aspect of the ability to achieve and maintain proper eye health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5705">'''Intratracheal instillation''' is the introduction of a substance directly into the [[trachea]].  It is widely used to test the [[Inhalation exposure|respiratory toxicity]] of a substance as an alternative to [[inhalation]] in [[animal testing]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Intratracheal instillation was reported as early as 1923 in studies of the [[carcinogen]]icity of [[coal tar]].

As compared to inhalation, intratracheal instillation allows greater control over the dose and location of the substance, is cheaper and less technically demanding, allows lower amounts of scarce or expensive substances to be used, allows substances to be tested that can be inhaled by humans but not small mammals, and minimizes exposure to laboratory workers and to the skin of laboratory animals.  Disadvantages include its nonphysiological and invasive nature, the [[confounding]] effects of the delivery vehicle and anesthesia, and the fact that it bypasses the [[upper respiratory tract]].  Instillation results in a less uniform distribution of the substance than inhalation, and the substance is cleared from the respiratory tract more slowly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Driscoll|first=Kevin E.

== Methodology ==
Intratracheal instillation is often performed with [[Laboratory mouse|mice]], [[Laboratory rat|rats]], or [[Laboratory hamster|hamsters]], with hamsters often preferred because their mouth can be opened widely to aid viewing the procedure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxvqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163|title=Toxicology of Nanomaterials|last=Zhao|first=Yuliang|date=2016-12-12|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9783527337972|location=|pages=163|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because they are more resistant to lung diseases than rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KhvqCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|title=Free Radicals and Inhalation Pathology|last=Schiller|first=Erich|date=2013-06-29|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9783642186196|location=|pages=63|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instillation is performed either through inserting a needle or [[catheter]] down the mouth and throat, or through surgically exposing the trachea and penetrating it with a needle.  Generally, short-acting inhaled [[anesthetic]] drugs such as [[halothane]], [[metaphane]], or [[enflurane]] are used during the instillation procedure.  [[Saline (medicine)|Saline solution]] is usually used as a delivery vehicle in a typical volume of 1–2 mL/kg body weight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A wide range of substances can be tested, including both soluble materials and insoluble particles or fibers, including [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4721">'''Kermack–McKendrick theory''' is a hypothesis that predicts the number and distribution 
of cases of an infectious disease as it is transmitted through a population over time.
Building principle on the research of [[Ronald Ross]] and [[Hilda Phoebe Hudson|Hilda Hudson]],
[[Anderson Gray McKendrick|A. G. McKendrick]] and [[William Ogilvy Kermack|W. O. Kermack]] published their theory in a set of three articles from 1927, 1932, and 1933.  While Kermack—McKendrick theory was indeed the source of [[epidemic model|SIR models]] and their relatives, Kermack and McKendrick were thinking of a more subtle and empirically useful problem than the simple [[compartmental model]]s discussed here.  The text is somewhat difficult to read, compared to modern papers, but the important feature is it was a model where the age-of-infection affected the transmission and removal rates.

Because of their seminal importance to the field of theoretical epidemiology, these articles were republished in the ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biology'' in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF02464423 | title=Contributions to the mathematical theory of epidemics—I | year=1991 | last1=Kermack | first1=W | last2=McKendrick | first2=A | journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology | volume=53 | pages=33–55 | pmid=2059741 | issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02464424  | title = Contributions to the mathematical theory of epidemics—II.

== Epidemic model (1927) ==
In its initial form, Kermack—McKendrick theory is a compartmental differential-equation model that structures the infectioned population in terms of age-of-infection, while
using simple compartments for people who are susceptible (S) and recovered/removed (R).
Specified initial conditions would change over time according to
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dt} = - \lambda S, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial i}{dt} + \frac{\partial i}{da} = \delta(a)  \lambda S- \gamma(a) i, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = \int_{0}^\infty \gamma(a) i(a,t) \, da ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta(a)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Dirac delta-function]] and the infection pressure

: &lt;math&gt; \lambda = \int_0^\infty \beta(a) i(a,t) \, da .&lt;/math&gt;

Only in the special case when the removal rate &lt;math&gt; \gamma(a) &lt;/math&gt; and the transmission rate &lt;math&gt; \beta(a) &lt;/math&gt; are constant for all ages does the substitution &lt;math&gt; I(t) = \int_0^\infty i(a,t) \, da &lt;/math&gt; transform
their theory into the simple [[epidemic model|SIR model]].  This basic model only accounts for infection and removal events, which are sufficient to describe a simple epidemic, including the threshold condition necessary for an epidemic to start, but can not explain endemic disease transmission or recurring epidemics.

== Endemic disease (1932, 1933) ==

In their subsequent articles, Kermack and McKendrick extended their theory to allow for birth, migration, and death, as well as imperfect immunity.  In modern notation, their model can be represented as

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dt} = b_0 + b_S S + b_I I + b_R R - \lambda S - m_S S, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{di}{dt} + \frac{di}{da} = \delta(a) \lambda ( S + \sigma R ) - \gamma(a) i - \mu(a) i - m_i(a) i, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I(t) = \int_0^\infty i(a,t) \, da &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = \int_0^\infty \gamma(a) i(a,t) \, da - \sigma \lambda R - m_R R,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;b_0&lt;/math&gt; is the immigration rate of susceptibles, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is the per-capita birth rate for state ''j'', ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is the per-capita mortality rate of individuals in state ''j'', &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the relative-risk of infection to recovered individuals who are partially immune, and the infection pressure

: &lt;math&gt; \lambda = \int_0^\infty \beta(a) i(a,t) \, da .&lt;/math&gt;

Kermack and McKendrick were able to show that it admits a stationary solution where disease is endemic, as long as the supply of susceptible individuals is sufficiently large.  This model is difficult to analyze in its full generality, and a number of open questions remain regarding its dynamics.

'''Kwame Addo-Kufuor''' (born 14 July 1940) is a [[Ghana]]ian politician and physician. Addo-Kufuor was a [[member of parliament]] from [[Manhyia (Ghana parliament constituency)|Manhyia]], and from 2001 to 2007 he was the [[Defense Minister|Minister for Defense]] under [[President of Ghana|President]] [[John Kufuor]], his brother. Between June 2008 and 2009, he was [[Interior Minister|Minister for Interior]].

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Kumasi]], Addo-Kufuor is a distinguished Ghanaian consultant physician and statesman, former president of the Ghana Medical Association and later, Ghana’s Minister of Defence and Interior. He concurrently served as Member of Parliament for the Manhyia Constituency in Kumasi from 1997 to 2008.

He was educated at Osei Tutu Boarding School ([[Osei Tutu Senior High School]]), before he proceeded to the famous [[Achimota School]] in Accra, Ghana after which he gained admission to study at [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]], [[University of Cambridge]], England, where he initially enrolled in the arts earning a master's degree before switching to the sciences to do a Bachelor of Medicine, and Bachelor of Surgery degree. He became the first black student to be secretary of the Medical Students Association at Jesus College before continuing with other advance courses in medicine at the University College Medical School, London. 
His postgraduate studies were at The Middlesex Medical School Hospital, London.
In 1975, Addo Kufuor passed the MRCP (UK) examination.

==Professional life==
Addo-Kufuor started his medical practice as a member of the teaching staff of the Middlesex Medical School Hospital and other hospitals in London before returning home to Ghana. He first worked at two of the country’s leading hospitals, the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra and later the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi. It was in Kumasi in 1978 that he later set up what became one of the city’s leadings clinics, Kufuor Clinic, of which he remains to date as the consultant-physician in charge.

In Kumasi during that period, he became a lecturer at the Department of Medicine at the [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology]], which university instituted in his honour in 1990, the Addo-Kufuor Prize for the best student in the final Bachelor of Medicine examination.

Currently a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] (London), of the [[Royal Society of Tropical Medicine]], the [[Ghana Medical Association]], and of the [[West African College of Physicians]], Addo-Kufuor was in 1993 appointed inspector of examinations for the final medical examinations at the University of Ghana Medical School. He also served as member of the executive council of the medical school and was appointed member of Court of Examiners responsible for assessing foreign trained doctors wishing to practice in Ghana by the Ghana Medical and Dental Council.

During his presidency of the Ghana Medical Association from 1992 to 1995, a critical period in Ghana’s transition to democratic rule, Addo-Kufuor successful steered the GMA off potential political conflicts and set on course infrastructural development for this professional association and was representative for West Africa on the Confederation of African Medical Associations.

When the ban on party politics was lifted by the military government of Jerry John Rawlings in 1992, Addo-Kufuor decided to go into public service and was unanimously elected as the Member of Parliament for the Manhyia Constituency of the New Patriotic Party from 1997 to 2008 when he resigned.
He was former chairman, Control Board of Command and Staff College of the Ghana Armed Forces, chairman of Cabinet Committee on Governance, and chairman of the board of Kofi Annan International Peace Keeping Centre.

In 2001, when the NPP won the Presidential elections and claimed majority in Parliament, Addo-Kufuor was appointed defence minister, a position he held until 2007.

Before his appointment as Minister for Defence, he was ranking member for
health in Parliament and played a leading role during the pilot stage of the
establishment of the National Health Insurance Scheme.

The new Ministry of Defence Complex, the Kofi Annan International
Peacekeeping Centre, Burma Hall, Burma Camp Computer Centre were among some of the major initiatives undertaken during his tenure as Minister for Defence.

Addo-Kufuor was instrumental in the construction of the new 37 Military
Hospital in Accra and with the support of Ghanaian and Indian colleagues, the elevation of the hospital to a post - graduate medical college currently training medical specialists.

The Beijing Barracks and the “Open Day” of the Ghana Armed Forces were
among the projects undertaken during this time.

As M.P. for Manhyia, he was responsible for many educational, health, and
infrastructural development initiatives. The Abbey Park Community Centre was
the most significant of these projects.

He was a member of the ECOWAS negotiation team that arranged the first
Meeting between the Ivorian government and the rebel movement, Forces
Nouvelles. He also led the Ministry of Defence delegations to China, UK, US, Russia,
Burundi, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Sierra Leone, India, Lebanon, Togo, and
South Africa.  These contacts helped to enhance the human and equipment
capabilities of the Ghana Armed Forces.

During the Dagbon chieftaincy crisis in northern Ghana, from 2002 to 2003, Addo–Kufuor served concurrently as defence minister and interior minister. In 2008, he was again appointed interior minister.  It was during this time he assisted in developing close collaboration between the police and military in the fight against armed robbery in Ghana. He was also instrumental in safeguarding the peace during the 2008 general elections.

In 2017, Addo-Kufuor was appointed by the government of Nana Addo Danquah Akufuo Addo as chairman of the board of directors of the SSNIT, the state pension fund.

Addo-Kufuor is an active member of the Anglican Church for many years. His
hobbies are gardening, reading, music, foreign travel, and listening to the radio.
He also enjoys boxing and football in a spectator capacity.

He married his wife Rosemary in London in 1966 and they have three children: Kwame, who is currently president of the Ghana Chamber of Mines; Kojo, an investment banker and the chief operating officer of Ghana Home Loans; and Nana Ama, also a banker and currently deputy managing director of the Eximbank, Ghana.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2487">'''La Borde''' is a [[Psychiatric hospital|psychiatric clinic]] that opened in 1951, near the town of [[Cour-Cheverny]] in the [[Loire Valley]] of France. Still in operation today, La Borde has been a model in the field of [[institutional psychotherapy]] where patients actively participate in running the facility.

==History==
The clinic was founded by [[Jean Oury]], a [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] who previously worked in experimental therapy at [[Saint-Alban Psychiatric Hospital]]. The psychiatric practice borrowed the idea of Hermann Simon that it is necessary to look after the establishment and to look after each patient, while returning initiative and responsibility to them by developing situations in which they can work and express their creativity.

From the mid-50s [[Félix Guattari]] worked at La Borde, developing its practice and organization and producing alongside Oury a body of theoretical work on the practice and theory of [[schizoanalysis]], set in practice at La Borde, and included in his 1972 collaboration with the philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]], ''[[Anti-Œdipus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Guattari (1984) and Deleuze and Guattari (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many aspects of La Borde is the annual summer tradition in which the "boarders" and staff work together to perform a play. [[Nicolas Philibert]], the documentary film-maker, made a documentary set at La Borde entitled ''Every Little Thing'' ([[French language|French]] ''[[:fr:La Moindre des choses:|La Moindre des choses]]''). The film was released in 1997 and follows the patients and staff staging their production of ''Operette'' by [[Witold Gombrowicz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0119689|title=Every Little Thing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land &amp; Water Australia''' was an Australian [[statutory corporation]] established under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act of 1989. Its primary focus was to organize and fund [[research and development]] activities which improved the long term productive capacity, sustainable use, management and conservation of Australia's land, water and vegetation resources.

It also acted as a research broker, organising collaborative programs like [http://managingclimate.gov.au Managing Climate Variability] and the [http://npsi.gov.au National Program for Sustainable Irrigation].

The research programs of Land &amp; Water Australia were managed to facilitate the purposeful co-investment of government and other funds to achieve natural resource management outcomes in 'productive lands' (a phrase used to differentiate it from land used predominantly for conservation, Indigenous or Defence purposes). The focus of most programs was on co-investment with research, policy and practitioners to get existing and new knowledge into the minds and hands of people who could use it. After the agency was closed responsibility for some programs and project was transferred.

Land &amp; Water Australia was closed in 2009.

Over the twenty years people at Land &amp; Water Australia learned and contributed a great deal in terms of science and policy understanding about managing Australian landscapes. They also learned a great deal about the business of investing in collaborative applied research, development and extension.  These insights are reflected in the following publications:

''The Getting of Knowledge: a guide to funding and managing applied research''

''The Australian NRM Knowledge System'': an analysis of how well current arrangements generate and organise the knowledge needed for Australia to manage its natural resource more wisely

''Knowledge for Managing Australian Landscapes'' (PDF): a comprehensive analysis of the knowledge needed for sustainable natural resource management in Australia and areas for improvement.

The legacy of Land &amp; Water Australia was the subject of a conference and a promised publication held at the Australian Academy of Science's Shine Dome in May 18–19, 2010, Canberra. Presentations and audio from the conference are available to download [http://lwa.gov.au/land-and-water-australia/land-water-australia-legacy-conference].

A list of achievements selected by the agency [http://lwa.gov.au/node/3710] include:
* the first work that identified the risk of endocrine disrupting chemicals in Australian waterways
* the AUSRIVAS system for measuring river health
* a wetting front detector to save irrigation water
* revealing a huge gap in our water accounts caused by double counting
* uncovering the myriad ways Australia farmers are adapting to our notoriously variable climate
* developing innovative incentives for farmers undertaking conservation works
* ‘controlled traffic’ farming systems to improve soil productivity and health
* identifying of the role of phosphorus, nitrogen and other factors in the development of blue-green algae in the Murray-Darling
* fundamental new research on Australia’s tropical river systems
* being the first to fund a high-profile project on eco-system services, which has gone on to become the framework for natural resource management and science in Australia and is of growing importance internationally
* working closely with the cotton industry to eliminate pesticide contamination of waterways
* working with the wool, meat and grains industries to develop more-sustainable mixed farming systems, research that won a Banksia Environmental Award
* developing, through the dryland salinity program, the model for collaboration of states and other agencies to address the major landscape challenge of dryland salinity. This program, which began in 1993, continues to inform management of Australian landscapes and reduce costs to agriculture.
* leading multi-partner programs to manage climate variability and Australia’s northern rivers, improve irrigation systems, and develop Australia’s national Climate Change Research Strategy for Primary Industries.
* through post-graduate scholarships, LWA has supported research training for more than 100 of the country’s brightest young environmental scientists.

Hyperlinks (see below) to programs, projects and documents started to fail in 2015, reducing accessibility.  There is concern that this substantial investment in knowledge to inform Australia's long-term social, environmental and economic well-being could be lost.  However, knowledge resides in many people and agencies.  An important Director of LWA, Peter Cullen, used to say, the challenge was to "make new mistakes".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Land &amp; Water Australia has a legacy of innovative, high impact and important research.

=== Research Program Evaluation ===

Land &amp; Water Australia's Board and Innovation Manager commissioned an excellent triple bottom line research evaluation that sought to report on the return on investment of projects and programs.  The TBL-ROI method was described by Chudleigh et al. (2006&lt;ref&gt;Chudleigh, P., Simpson, S. and Schofield, N. (2006) ‘Economic Evaluation of R&amp;D Investment in Natural Resource Management’, Evaluation Journal of Australasia, 6: 37–48.&lt;/ref&gt;) and further developed (Schofield et al., 2007&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, N., Chudleigh, P., Simpson, S. and Pearson, S. (2007) Land &amp; Water Australia’s Portfolio Return on Investment &amp; Evaluation Case Studies, (Canberra: Land &amp; Water Australia) &lt;http://lwa.gov.au/products/ec071442&gt; accessed 2 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;) before being rapidly adopted in a rolling evaluation of Australia’s agricultural research and development investment of about A$441m per year.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson S; Chudleigh P; Simpson S; Schofield N, 2012, 'Learning to invest better: Using ex post investment analysis on agri-environmental research and development', Research Evaluation, vol. 21, pp. 136 - 151, https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvs008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Life satisfaction''' (LS) is the way in which people show their emotions, feelings (moods) and how they feel about their directions and options for the [[future]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anand|first1=Paul|title=Happiness Explained|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198735458}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}  It is a measure of [[Quality of life|well-being]] assessed in terms of mood, satisfaction with relationships, achieved goals, [[self-concepts]], and self-perceived ability to cope with one's daily life. Life satisfaction involves a favorable [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards one's life rather than an assessment of current feelings. Life satisfaction has been measured in relation to economic standing, degree of [[education]], experiences, residence, among many other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life satisfaction|url=http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/life-satisfaction/|publisher=OECD Better Life Index|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Review of Life Satisfaction Research with Children and Adolescents|pages=196|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/spq/18/2/192.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Work-Family Conflict, Policies, and the Job-Life Satisfaction Relationship: A Review and Directions for Organizational Behavior-Human Resources Research|pages=145|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/83/2/139.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Life Review Therapy Using Autobiographical Retrieval Practice for Older Adults With Depressive Symptomatology|pages=274|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pag/19/2/272.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life satisfaction is a key part of [[Tripartite model of subjective well-being|subjective wellbeing]].

==Factors affecting life satisfaction==

===Personality===

One of the primary concepts of [[personality]] is the Big Five factor model. This model illustrates what some researchers believe to be the building blocks of every individual's personality.  This model considers the dimensions of [[openness to experience]], [[conscientiousness]], [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], and [[neuroticism]]. In a study carried out by Deneve and Cooper in 1998, multiple studies were analyzed with certain personality questionnaires that linked subjective well-being and personality measures. They found that neuroticism was the strongest predictor of life satisfaction{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=describes specific research without citing it directly}}. Neuroticism is also linked to people who have difficulty making up their mind, and is common in people who suffer from mental illness. The personality factor "openness to experience" is positively correlated with life satisfaction. Apart from the personality dimensions studied in the Big Five model, the trait [[chronotype]] has been related to life satisfaction; morning-oriented people ("larks") showed higher life satisfaction than evening-oriented individuals ("owls").&lt;ref&gt;[http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07420528.2012.685671?journalCode=cbi Jankowski, K.S. (2012). Morningness/Eveningness and Satisfaction With Life in a Polish Sample. ''Chronobiology International, 29,''780-785.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07420528.2013.840786 Díaz-Morales, J.F., Jankowski, K.S., Vollmer, C., Randler, C. (2013). Morningness and life satisfaction: further evidence from Spain. ''Chronobiology International, 30,''1283-1285.]&lt;/ref&gt;

More frequent socialization can also contribute to overall well-being. Social support via others has been shown to affect the well-being of adults and the overall health of those individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guindon|first=Sophie|last2=Cappeliez|first2=Philippe|date=2010-03-01|title=Contributions of Psychological Well-Being and Social Support to an Integrative Model of Subjective Health in Later Adulthood|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12126-009-9050-7|journal=Ageing International|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=38–60|doi=10.1007/s12126-009-9050-7|issn=0163-5158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, people who tend to communicate, and who are considered to be more open to others would have a higher-level of life satisfaction.

Heritability has been shown to have an effect on how one is ranked in terms of life satisfaction. Heritability plays a role in both personality and individual experiences. Research suggests that heritability can influence life satisfaction to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stubbe|first=J. H.|last2=Posthuma|first2=D.|last3=Boomsma|first3=D.

De|date=November 2005|title=Heritability of life satisfaction in adults: a twin-family study|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/heritability-of-life-satisfaction-in-adults-a-twinfamily-study/558C8A4355B220F6A6EF69EEB93B3C99|journal=Psychological Medicine|language=en|volume=35|issue=11|pages=1581–1588|doi=10.1017/s0033291705005374|issn=1469-8978}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study found that there were no individual differences between males and females in terms of the heritability of life-satisfaction, however the personality elements that were affected by heritability did seem to have an effect on their overall life-satisfaction.

It has been further suggested that being able to independently deal with negative emotions can influence long-term life-satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lightsey|first=Owen Richard|last2=McGhee|first2=Richelle|last3=Ervin|first3=Audrey|last4=Gharghani|first4=George Gharibian|last5=Rarey|first5=Eli Benjamin|last6=Daigle|first6=Rosaire Patrick|last7=Wright|first7=Katherine Frances|last8=Constantin|first8=Donnalin|last9=Powell|first9=Kevin|date=2013-03-01|title=Self-Efficacy for Affect Regulation as a Predictor of Future Life Satisfaction and Moderator of the Negative Affect—Life Satisfaction Relationship|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-011-9312-4|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1007/s10902-011-9312-4|issn=1389-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a personality capable of properly dealing with emotions like anger, angst, or hate can be beneficial when dealing with similar things later in life. People who are more easy-going tend to deal with their negative emotions differently than someone who is up-tight. These individual differences can influence the way people deal with problems in the present and how they deal with similar situations in the future.

===Self-esteem===
The [[Satisfaction with Life Index|Satisfaction with Life Scale]] (SWLS) is a single scale that is used by [[UNESCO]], the [[CIA]], the [[New Economics Foundation]], the [[World Health Organization|WHO]], the Veenhoven Database, the Latinbarometer, the [[Afrobarometer]], and the UNHDR to measure how one views his or her [[self-esteem]], well-being and overall happiness with life.&lt;ref&gt;Subjective well-being: Three decades of progress. Diener, Ed; Suh, Eunkook M.; Lucas, Richard E.; Smith, Heidi L. Psychological Bulletin, Vol 125(2), Mar 1999, 276-302. doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276&lt;/ref&gt; Previous modeling showed that positive views and life satisfaction were completely mediated by the concept of self-esteem, together with the different ways in which ideas and events are perceived by people. Several studies found that self-esteem plays a definite role in influencing life satisfaction. By knowing yourself and your worth, you are driven to think in a positive way. There is also a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] model that supports these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last=Cummins|first=Robert|date=October 8, 2002|title=Normative Life Satisfaction: Measurement Issues and a Homeostatic Model|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p64850x664r20q06/fulltext.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outlook on life===
A person's mood and outlook on life can also influence his or her perception of his or her own life satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Frisch"&gt;Bailey, T., Eng, W., Frisch, M., &amp; Snyder, C. R. (2007), "Hope and optimism as related to life satisfaction." ''Journal of Positive Psychology'', 2(3), 168-69.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of [[emotion]]s that may influence how people perceive their lives. [[Hope]] and [[optimism]] both consist of cognitive processes that are usually oriented towards the reaching of goals and the perception of those goals. Additionally, optimism is linked to higher life satisfaction, whereas pessimism is related to symptoms in depression.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, E. C., &amp; Sanna, L. J. (2001). Optimism, pessimism, and positive and negcative affectivity in middle-aged adults: a test of a cognitive-affective model of psychological adjustment. Psychology and Aging, 16(3), 524-531. [http://positiveemotions.gr/library_files/C/Chang_Sanna_Optimism_2001.pdf doi: 10.1037/08827974163524]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Seligman, the happier people are, the less they focus on the negative aspects of their lives. Happier people also have a greater tendency to like other people, which promotes a happier environment. This correlates to a higher level of the person's satisfaction with his or her life, due to the notion that constructiveness with others can positively influence life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. (2002), "Positive emotions undo negative ones". ''Authentic Happiness''. New York, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have found that life satisfaction is compatible with profoundly negative emotional states like depression.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, T. (1981), "Happiness, Contentment and the Good Life". ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Life-review therapy using [[Autobiographical Retrieval Practice]] for older adults with depressive symptoms, in a study carried out by Serrano JP, Latorre JM, Gatz M, and Montanes J, Department of Psychology at Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, demonstrated that, with increased specificity of memories, individuals show decreased depression and hopelessness and increased life satisfaction. The test was designed to measure participants' ability to recall a specific memory in response to a cue word, while being timed.
Thirty cue words; including five words classified as 'positive' (e.g., ''funny, lucky, passionate, happy, hopeful),'' five as 'negative' ''(unsuccessful, unhappy, sad, abandoned, gloomy),'' and five as 'neutral' ''(work, city, home, shoes, family);'' were presented orally in a fixed, alternating order to each member of a focus group. To ensure that the participants understood the instructions, examples were provided of both 'general' memories (e.g., summers in the city) and 'specific' memories (e.g., the day I got married). For each cue word, participants were asked to share a memory evoked by that word.  The memory had to be of an event that should have occurred only once, at a particular time and place, and lasted no longer than a day. 
If the person could not recall a memory within 30 seconds, then that cue instance was not counted. Two psychologists served as raters and independently scored the responses of each participant.  Each memory was tagged either as 'specific' – if the recalled event lasted no more than one day – or, otherwise, as 'general'. The raters were not informed regarding the hypotheses of the study, the experimental (control) group's membership, nor the content of the pretest or post-test.

===Age===

The psychologists Yuval Palgi and [[Dov Shmotkin]] (2009) studied people who were primarily in their nineties. This subject group was found to have thought highly of their past and present. But generally, the group thought lower of their future. These people were very satisfied with their life up until the point they were surveyed but knew that the end was near and so were not quite as hopeful for the future.  Intelligence is also a factor because life satisfaction grows as people become older; as they grow older, they become wiser and more knowledgeable, so they begin to see that life will be better and understand the important things in life more.&lt;ref&gt;Palgi, Y., &amp; Shmotkin, D. (2010), "The predicament of time near the end of life: Time perspective trajectories of life satisfaction among the old-old." ''Aging &amp; Mental Health'', 14(5), 577- 86. {{doi|10.1080/13607860903483086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been recorded that adolescents seem to have a lower level of life satisfaction than their older counterparts. This could be because many decisions are imminent, and an adolescent could be facing them for the first time in his or her life. Although many adolescents have insecurities about many aspects of their lives, satisfaction with friends stayed at a consistent level. This is hypothesized to be due to the amount one can identify with those in one's age group over other age groups. In this same study, researchers found that satisfaction with family decreased. This could be because more rules and regulations are typically implemented by parental figures, and adolescents tend to demonize those in control of them. Also, it was found that life satisfaction in terms of sexuality increased. This is because at this age many adolescents reach sexual maturation, which can encourage them to find verification and satisfaction in the idea of a sexual partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldbeck|first=Lutz|last2=Schmitz|first2=Tim G.|last3=Besier|first3=Tanja|last4=Herschbach|first4=Peter|last5=Henrich|first5=Gerhard|date=2007-08-01|title=Life satisfaction decreases during adolescence|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-007-9205-5|journal=Quality of Life Research|language=en|volume=16|issue=6|pages=969–979|doi=10.1007/s11136-007-9205-5|issn=0962-9343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life events and experiences===

It has been suggested that there are several factors that contribute towards our level of life satisfaction. Experiences that are both acute events (e.g., death of
a loved one) and chronic, daily experiences (e.g., ongoing family discord) influence self-reports of life satisfaction. The book “Happier” by Harvard lecturer Tal Ben-Shahar argues that happiness should be one's ultimate goal, the primary factor in evaluating alternative choices. As the subtitle implies, Happier recommends for us to pursue immediate joyful experience in ways that contributes to more long-term, meaningful satisfaction. Furthermore, Ben-Shahar argues that pursuing genuine self-motivated goals, rather than just instant pleasure or selflessness in service of long-delayed enjoyment, results in an optimal combination of short- and long-term happiness.

Differences in experience can greatly shape the way that we observe and engage with the world around us. It can influence the way we speak to people, the way we act in public, and our general outlook. These experiences which shape the way we think about our surroundings affect our life-satisfaction. Someone who has the tendency to see the world in a more negative light, may have a completely different level of satisfaction than someone who is constantly admiring the beauty of his or her surroundings. People who engage with more stress on average tend to have higher levels of stress can contribute to higher levels of self-report life satisfaction, as long as those who understand how to deal with their stress in a positive way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burger|first=Kaspar|last2=Samuel|first2=Robin|date=2017-01-01|title=The Role of Perceived Stress and Self-Efficacy in Young People’s Life Satisfaction: A Longitudinal Study|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-016-0608-x|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=78–90|doi=10.1007/s10964-016-0608-x|issn=0047-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasonal effects===

A recent study analyzes time-dependent rhythms in happiness comparing life satisfaction by weekdays (weekend neurosis), days of the month (negative effects towards the end of the month) and year with gender and education and outlining the differences observed.&lt;ref&gt;Maennig, W., Steenbeck, M., Wilhelm, M. (2013), Rhythms and Cycles in Happiness, http://www.uni-hamburg.de/economicpolicy/publications.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily within the winter months of the year, an onset of depression can affect us, which is called seasonal affective disorder (SAD). It is recurrent, beginning in the fall or winter months, and remitting in the spring or summer.&lt;ref name="Seasonal affective disorder"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1998-10-24|title=Seasonal affective disorder|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673698010150|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=352|issue=9137|pages=1369–1374|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)01015-0|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that those who experience this disorder usually have a history of major depressive or bipolar disorder, which may be hereditary, having a family member affected as well.

Seasonal affective disorder is hypothesized to be caused by the diminishing of the exposure to environmental light which can lead to changes in levels of the neurotransmitter chemical seratonin. Diminishing active seratonin levels increases depressive symptoms. There are currently a few treatment therapies in order to help with seasonal affective disorder. The first line of therapy is light therapy. Light therapy involves exposure to bright, white light that mimics outdoor light, counteracting the presumed cause of SAD. Due to the shifts in one's neurochemical levels, antidepressants are another form of therapy. Other than light therapy and antidepressants, there are several alternatives which involve agomelatine, melatonin, psychological interventions, as well as diet and lifestyle changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.boisestate.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&amp;sid=43aaf03c-f3c6-4676-b8fe-016f02564714@sessionmgr4007|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.boisestate.edu|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that the onset of SAD typically occurs between the ages of 20–30 years, but most affected people do not seek medical help.&lt;ref name="Seasonal affective disorder"/&gt; This could be due to the stigma of mental health issues. Many are afraid to state they are suffering and would rather hide it. As a society we should push forward towards greater acceptance and gain knowledge in order to solve these issues.

===Values===

It is proposed that overall life satisfaction comes from within an individual based on the individual's personal values and what he or she holds important. For some it is family, for others it is love, and for others it is money or other material items; either way, it varies from one person to another. [[Economic materialism]] can be considered a value. Previous research found that materialistic individuals were predominantly male, and that materialistic people also reported a lower life satisfaction level than their non-materialistic counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Influence of Materialistic Inclination on Values, Life Satisfaction and Aspirations: An Empirical Analysis | journal = Springer | year = 2000 | first =  Ah Kau | last =  Keng |author2=Kwon Jung |author3=Tan Soo Jiuan |author4=Jochen Wirtz | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 317–33|doi=10.1023/A:1006956602509 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/qg25274527610p64/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true of people who value money over helping other people; this is because the money they have can buy them the assets they deem valuable.&lt;ref name="GeorgellisYannis"&gt;Georgellis, Yannis; Tsitsianis, Nicholas; Yin, Ya Ping, "Personal Values as Mitigating Factors in Link Between Income and Life Satisfaction: Evidence from the European Social Survey". ''Social Indicators Research'', Vol 91(3), May, 2009. pp. 329-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Materialistic people are less satisfied with life because they constantly want more and more belongings, and once those belongings are obtained they lose value, which in turn causes these people to want more belongings and the cycle continues. If these materialistic individuals do not have enough money to satisfy their craving for more items, they become more dissatisfied. This has been referred to as a [[hedonic treadmill]]. Individuals reporting a high value on traditions and religion reported a higher level of life satisfaction. This is also true for reported routine churchgoers and people who pray frequently. Other individuals that reported higher levels of life satisfaction were people who valued creativity, and people who valued respect for and from others – two more qualities seemingly not related to material goods.&lt;ref name="GeorgellisYannis" /&gt; Because hard times come around and often people count on their peers and family to help them through, it is no surprise that a higher life satisfaction level was reported of people who had social support, whether it be friends, family, or church. The people who personally valued material items were found to be less satisfied overall in life as opposed to people who attached a higher amount of value with interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, C., Mei, T., &amp; Chen, L. (2009), "How do positive views maintain life satisfaction". Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; accordance with the findings above, it is also fair to say that the notion of how one values themselves plays a part in how someone considers their own life. People who take pride in themselves by staying mentally and physically fit have higher levels of life satisfaction purely due to the content of their day. These values come together in determining how somebody sees themselves in light of others.

===Culture===

Defining culture by reference to deeply engrained societal values and beliefs. Culture affects the [[subjective well-being]]. Well-being includes both general life satisfaction, and the relative balance of positive affect verses negative affect in daily life. Culture directs the attention to different sources of information for making the life satisfaction judgments, thus affecting subjective well-being appraisal.

Individualistic cultures direct attention to inner states and feelings (such as positive or negative affects), while in collectivistic cultures the attention is directed to outer sources (i.e. adhering to social norms or fulfilling one's duties). Indeed, Suh et al. (1998) found that the correlation between life satisfaction and the prevalence of positive affect is higher in individualistic cultures, whereas in collectivistic cultures affect and adhering to norms are equally important for life satisfaction. Most of modern western societies, such as the United States and European countries are directed towards individualism, while the eastern societies like China and Japan, are directed towards collectivism. Those of a collectivistic culture emphasize deeply on the unity one has with their families. They put others' needs before their individual desires. An individualistic culture is geared towards one's own personal achievements and it signals a strong sense of competition. They are expected to carry their own weight and rely on themselves. The United States is said to be one of the most individualistic countries, and on the other hand Korea and Japan are some of the most collectivistic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Ken I.|last2=Park|first2=Hun-Joon|last3=Suzuki|first3=Nori|date=1990|title=Reward Allocations in the United States, Japan, and Korea: A Comparison of Individualistic and Collectivistic Cultures|jstor=256358|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=33|issue=1|pages=188–198|doi=10.2307/256358}}&lt;/ref&gt; However both groups have their flaws. With an individualistic approach, one is inclined in possibly experiencing loneliness. Meanwhile, those in a collectivist culture, may be prone to having a dismay of rejection.

===Family===

Life satisfaction can also be looked at in a new one as influenced by a family. Family life satisfaction is a pertinent topic as everyone's family influences them in some way and most strive to have high levels of satisfaction in life as well as within their own family. As discussed by Gary L. Bowen in his article, "Family Life Satisfaction: A Value Based Approach" he examines how family life satisfaction is enhanced by the ability of family members to jointly realize their family-related values in behavior (459). It is important to examine family life satisfaction from all members of the family from a "perceived" perspective and an "ideal" perspective. Greater life satisfaction within a family increases through communication and understanding each member's attitudes and perceptions. A family can make all the difference for someone's life satisfaction.

In the article "Family System Characteristics, Parental Behaviors, and Adolescent Life Satisfaction" by Carolyn S. Henry, adolescent life satisfaction has much different origins than the life satisfaction of adults. An adolescent's life satisfaction is heavily influenced by his or her family's dynamic and characteristics. Family bonding, family flexibility, parental support are all huge factors into the adolescent's life satisfaction. The more bonding, flexibility, and support there is within a family the higher the adolescent's life satisfaction. Results of this study also revealed that adolescents living in a single-parent family home had significantly lower life satisfaction that adolescents in a two-parent home. An adolescent's age is extremely important in terms of life satisfaction coming from their family (Henry).

Family also relates to life satisfaction in a very different way: a woman's decision to have children or not. In the "Relationship between Information Search in the Childbearing Decision and Life Satisfaction for Parents and Nonparents" article by Carole K. Holahan, reveals that childless women have much higher life satisfaction than women with children. Women who consciously decided not to have children overall had very high life satisfaction. It was found that most of the life satisfaction came from careers instead of children. On the other hand, women who did have children had high life satisfaction which depended on the reasons and decision making for having children. These are just generalizations and life satisfaction comes from many different sources which are unique and different for every person. Life satisfaction can shift all the time from events, situations, family and friend implications and many different things that all must be taken into consideration.

On the other hand, life satisfaction is also affected by parenthood and couples introducing children into their relationship. Research has shown that adults with children are less happy (McLanahan &amp; Adams 1987) due to less life satisfaction, less marital satisfaction, more anxiety and more depression.

===Career===
A satisfying career is an important component of life satisfaction.  Doing something meaningful in a productive capacity contributes to one's feeling of life satisfaction. This notion of accomplishment is related to a person’s drive. Need for accomplishment is an essential part of becoming a fully functional person, and if someone feels accomplished they would be more able to see bright sides in their life; thus improving their life satisfaction

Internationally, the salary one earns is important – income levels show a moderate correlation with individual evaluations of life satisfaction. However, in developed nations, the connection is weak and disappears for the most part when individuals earn enough money to meet basic needs (Kahneman &amp; Deaton 2010; Diener et al., 2010; Myers and Diener, 1995).

Manfred Curry wrote a pioneering&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sailingworld.com/article.jsp?typeID=398&amp;catID=608&amp;ID=200783&lt;/ref&gt; book on [[yacht]] [[aerodynamics]] and racing tactics, published in several editions and several languages,&lt;ref&gt;''Yacht Racing The Aerodynamics of Sails and Racing Tactics''.

'''Markus Kronthaler''' (April 5, 1967 – July 8, 2006) was an Austrian [[Gendarmerie (Austria)|gendarme]] and [[Mountaineering|mountaineer]].

Kronthaler was born in [[Kufstein]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]. He was an officer in the alpine section of Austria's [[Gendarmerie]], which he left in 2003 to become a professional climber. Surviving a free fall of 150 meters (450&amp;nbsp;ft) into snow in January 2006, Kronthaler led a new expedition to [[Chogolisa]] and [[Broad Peak]], [[Pakistan]], in May 2006. He died of [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] on [[Broad Peak]] after reaching the summit on July 8. His body was left on the mountain.

In the summer of 2007, an Austrian mountaineering team climbed Broad Peak to retrieve Kronthaler's corpse, which was brought to Austria and cremated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everestnews.com/pak2009/paknews09102009.htm Markus Kronthaler - an appreciation from a brother to a brother&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the highest ever body recovery from a mountain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpinist.com/doc/ALP20/newswire-kronthaler-body-broad-8000 Highest-Altitude Body Recovery In History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His urn was buried in [[Kufstein]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1599">In [[statistics]], '''median follow-up''' is the [[median]] time between a specified event and the time when data on outcomes are gathered.  The concept is used in [[Cancer survival rates|cancer survival]] analyses.

Many [[Cancer research|cancer studies]] aim to assess the time between two events of interest, such as from [[Treatment of cancer|treatment]] to [[Remission (medicine)|remission]], treatment to [[relapse]], or [[Diagnosis (medical)|diagnosis]] to death. This duration is generically called [[survival time]], even if the end point is not death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Time to event analysis|Time-to-event studies]] must have sufficiently long follow-up durations to capture enough events to reveal meaningful patterns in the data. A short follow-up duration is appropriate for studying very severe cancers with poor [[Prognosis|prognoses]], whereas a long follow-up duration is better suited to studying less-severe disease, or participants with good prognoses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Clark, M. J. Bradburn, S. B. Love and D. G. Altman (15 July 2003). "Survival Analysis Part I: Basic concepts and first analyses". British Journal of Cancer. {{PMC|2394262}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Median follow-up time is included in about half the survival analyses published in cancer journals, but of those, only 31% specify the method used to compute it.&lt;ref&gt;Schemper and Terry L. Smith (1996). "A Note on Quantifying Follow-up in Studies of Failure Time". Elsevier (Department of Medical Computer Sciences, Vienna University, Austria).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6595">[[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG)’s National Department of Health is a statutory organisation focused on the delivery of better health services for the people of Papua New Guinea.

The department’s stated key goals for the period from 2009 to 2013 are:

* Full immunisation of all children under the age of 1;
* Reduction of maternal mortality;
* Reduction of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[Tuberculosis|TB]] prevalence;
* Improving access to service for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.health.gov.pg/aboutus.html | title=About Us | author=National Department of Health Headquarters | publisher=Department of Health | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316194850/http://www.health.gov.pg/aboutus.html | archivedate=2012-03-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Minister for Health is [[Hon. Dr Puka Temu]]. 

==Controversies ==

PNG’s National Department of Health has been accused of corruption, including taking bribes from pharmaceutical companies and misappropriation of government funds.

===Ongoing Investigation into Corruption===

In October 2011, [[Investigation Task Force Sweep]] Chairman [[Sam Koim]] expanded Task Force Sweep’s scope to include an investigation into corruption at the National Department of Health. His team began the process of collecting and collating information on:
* (a) Instances of misappropriation of funds and assets,
* (b) Instances of corruption in the procurement of medicines, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, and
* (c) Activities of provincial hospitals and rural facilities.
A report on these findings is due to be provided to the National Executive Council (NEC) in the coming months. The investigation was initiated after Maxtone-Graham handed over a file to the police fraud squad which contained allegations of corrupt activities in his department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20111010/news01.htm |title=Sweep team eyes Health Dept |author1=TODAGIA KELOLA |author2=BOLA NOHO |publisher=Post Courier |date=10 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120906160251/http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20111010/news01.htm |archivedate=6 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In May 2011, Dr Clement Malau (Dr Malua), former Secretary for Health and Head of the National Department of Health until August 2011, under the previous PNG administration, was under fire for depositing a sum of PGK1.767 million from government money into the Bank of South Pacific (BSP) in 1998, instead using it for healthcare purposes and, ten years later, in August 2008, authorising the re-payment of this amount, plus interest, to an unregistered company named PACPNG Pharmaceuticals, instead of back to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://pngexposed.wordpress.com/2011/05/10/malau-where-is-the-money/ | title= Dr Malau, where is the money? | author= Ex Health worker | publisher=PNGExposed Blog| date=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payments from Pharmaceutical Companies===

In March 2011, it was reported that senior officials in the National Department of Health received massive [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] from pharmaceutical companies for a period of up to ten years.&lt;ref name="TackleHealth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=92202 | title=PAPUA NEW GUINEA: Moves to tackle health kickback scam| author=IRIN| publisher=IRIN| date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Dr Malau said payments by medical suppliers to government officials for favours had run into “the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars”.&lt;ref name="TackleHealth" /&gt;

PNG's former Health Minister Sasa Zibe also stated that the Health Department's drug supply division “is riddled with corruption and is ineffective”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/pacbeat/stories/201104/s3186457.htm | title=PNG to overhaul drug procurement | author=Radio Australia| publisher=Radio Australia| date=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The government blamed a lack of transparency within the tender process as a reason why the corruption went unnoticed for such a long period of time. However, pharmaceutical companies that have significant contracts with the PNG government, including Borneo Pacific Pharmaceutical Ltd, remained silent when questioned by the media.

Doctors in national hospitals reported that they were “starved” of drugs in order to create an emergency system that would allow the National Department of Health to bypass the tender process and give preferential treatment to certain pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speroforum.com/a/50352/Papua-New-Guinea---Moves-to-tackle-health-kickback-scam | title=Papua New Guinea: Moves to tackle health kickback scam | author=IRIN | publisher=Spero News| date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In order to combat these allegations, Dr Malau hired a drug procurement and distribution specialist, charged with establishing an efficient drug ordering and distribution system. However, officials in the department attempted to terminate the expert’s contract prematurely.&lt;ref name="TackleHealth" /&gt;

===AUSAID Paper===

A paper prepared by the Australian government’s aid division, [[AUSAID]] in 2005, stated that although the country has a sound national health policy, a number of factors are hindering its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/png_health.pdf |title=A review of capacity, change and performance issues |author1=Joe Bolger |author2=Angela Mandie-Filer |author3=Volker Hauck |publisher=European Centre for Development Policy Management |date=January 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227163458/http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/png_health.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These factors include:

* Management issues;
* Relationships;
* Financing arrangements;
* The skills of health practitioners; and
* External factors such as the institutional rules which affect the behaviour of sector stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pubout.cfm?ID=5887_4407_5885_6927_4021 |title=Papua New Guinea's health sector: A review of capacity, changes and performance issues |author1=Joe Bolger |author2=Angela Mandie-Filer |author3=Volker Hauck |publisher=Australian Government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227121019/http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pubout.cfm?ID=5887_4407_5885_6927_4021 |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30190">'''The Norwegian Child Welfare Services''' ({{lang-no|Barnevernet}}, literally "child protection") are the public agencies responsible for [[child welfare]] in [[Norway]]. They consist of services in each [[Municipalities of Norway|municipality]], which are aided and supervised by different governmental bodies at the state as well as the [[Counties of Norway|county]] level.

The Child Welfare Services’ statutory obligation is "to ensure that children and youth who live in conditions that may be detrimental to their health and development receive the necessary assistance and care at the right time."&lt;ref name="Child Welfare Act, § 1-1"&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], § 1-1&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 3% of all children in Norway receive some sort of measure from the Child Welfare Services, most of them in the form of relief measures to the child and its parents (such as counselling, advice, external support contacts, access to day care etc.).&lt;ref name="ssb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssb.no/en/sosiale-forhold-og-kriminalitet/statistikker/barneverng |title=
Child welfare, 2015 |author=T. Dyrhaug |date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Statistics Norway |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In about one quarter of the cases, the children are placed outside their homes (mainly in foster families or institutions) after care orders.

== Organisation ==
The Norwegian Child Welfare Services were established, and their activities are regulated, by the Child Welfare Act of 1992,&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]]&lt;/ref&gt; which has the purpose "to ensure that children and youth who live in conditions that may be detrimental to their health and development receive the necessary assistance and care at the right time," and "to help ensure children and youth grow up in a secure environment"&lt;ref name="Child Welfare Act, § 1-1"/&gt;

The superior authority in the field of child welfare in Norway is the [[Norwegian Ministry of Children and Equality|Ministry of Children and Equality]] (Norwegian ''Barne- og likestillingsdepartementet'', abbreviated ''BLD'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], § 2-2&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry is responsible for developing regulations and guidelines, but is not involved in individual cases.&lt;ref name="Child Welfare Act, § 2-3"&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], § 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Each [[Municipalities of Norway|Norwegian municipality]] is obliged to have Child Welfare Services.&lt;ref name="Child Welfare Act, § 2-1"&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], § 2-1&lt;/ref&gt; These are responsible for the local and day-to-day implementation of the Child Welfare Act (such as preventive work, investigation, support service, approval of foster families, follow-up of children placed in foster families or institutions).&lt;ref name="Child Welfare Act, § 2-1"/&gt; This "municipal child welfare" is aided by two agencies that constitute the "governmental child welfare":
* The Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and Family Affairs (Norwegian ''Barne-, ungdoms- og familiedirektoratet'', abbreviated ''Bufdir'') is a governmental body responsible for the "theoretical" aspects of child welfare (interpretation of the law and commissioning and dissemination of research).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bufdir.no/en/English_start_page/About_us/ |title=About us |date=29 March 2016 |publisher=The Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and Family Affairs |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Office for Children, Youth and Family Affairs (Norwegian ''Barne-, ungdoms- og familieetaten'', abbreviated ''Bufetat'') is a governmental body responsible for the "practical" aspects of child welfare (approval and management of child welfare institutions, recruitment and training of foster families).&lt;ref name="Child Welfare Act, § 2-3"/&gt;

In addition, the following bodies at the [[Counties of Norway|county level]] are involved in child welfare:
* The County Social Welfare Boards (Norwegian ''Fylkesnemnda for barnevern og sosiale saker'') function as tribunals that have to approve of any compulsory measures and care orders (i.e., decisions that parents lose custody of their child). It has an autonomous position in relation to the Ministry and the County Governor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[County Governor (Norway)|County Governor]]s, representing the governmental authority at the county level, supervise the activities of the municipalities and child welfare institutions and handle appeals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], §§ 2-3, 6-5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support and assistance ==
The Child Welfare Services are responsible for implementing measures for children and their families in situations where there are special needs in relation to the home environment. Assistance may be provided as [[counselling]], advisory services, and aid measures, including external support contacts, relief measures in the home, and access to [[day care]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], § 4-4&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Under the guidelines of the Norwegian Child Welfare Services, children are entitled to participate in decisions involving their personal welfare, and have the right to state their views in accordance with their age and level of maturity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], §§ 4-1, 6-3&lt;/ref&gt; This applies especially in cases where there are administrative and legal proceedings that will strongly affect the children's day-to-day lives.

== Duties ==
The Child Welfare Services are required to take action if measures implemented in the home environment are not sufficient to safeguard the child's needs. In such cases, the Child Welfare Service in consultation with the parents may place children under [[foster care]], in a [[child welfare institution]], or introduce specific parent–child measures.&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], §§ 4-4, 4-4a&lt;/ref&gt;

Removing a child from the home without parental consent is a measure of last resort in cases of (justifiable suspicion of) serious neglect, [[maltreatment]], [[violence]], [[abuse]], [[trafficking]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], §§ 4-12, 4-29&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a decision from the County Social Welfare Board on the basis of a recommendation submitted by the municipal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], §§ 4-4, 4-10&lt;/ref&gt; In urgent cases (i.e. imminent danger for the [[health|physical]] or [[mental health]] of the child), the municipal welfare services are entitled (and obliged) to issue a provisional care order.&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], § 4-6&lt;/ref&gt; Provisional care orders expire after six weeks unless they are confirmed by the County Social Welfare Board. Decisions taken by the County Social Welfare Board may only be overturned by the [[judiciary of Norway|courts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], § 7-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipal Child Welfare Services are charged with monitoring the development of children who have been placed in care outside their homes as well as their parents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], §§ 4-22, 4-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Child Welfare Service employees are privy to a large amount of personal client information, and must comply with strict rules of [[confidentiality]]. However, information may be provided to other administrative agencies when this is necessary for carrying out child welfare service tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], § 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
According to figures provided by [[Statistics Norway]], 36,800 children received measures from the Norwegian Child Welfare Services at the end of 2015.&lt;ref name="ssb" /&gt; This means that 2.9% of all children in Norway received some sort of measure. Of these, 12% were aged 0–2 years, 23% 3–5 years, 30% 6–12 years, and 35% 13–17 years. In addition, 6,800 young people aged 18–22 years (1.1% of their age class) received follow-up care.&lt;ref name="ssb" /&gt;

60% of the 36,800 children received support measures within their families. 16% received support measures while placed outside their homes with the consent of their parents. In the remainder 24% of the cases, children were placed outside their homes after care orders.&lt;ref name="ssb" /&gt; Of the 14,850 children living outside their homes by the end of 2015, 72% lived in foster families, 14% were old enough to live by themselves with follow-up from the Child Welfare Services, and 8% were taken care of in institutions, while 5% where temporarily placed in private homes awaiting other solutions.&lt;ref name="ssb" /&gt;

The main reasons for measures (both support measures and care measures) were lacking parenting skills (29%), parents’ mental problems (17%), high domestic conflict level (11%) and parents’ drug misuse (8%).&lt;ref name="ssb" /&gt;

Statistics Norway has also published some figures according to [[immigration]] status:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssb.no/sosiale-forhold-og-kriminalitet/artikler-og-publikasjoner/kvart-fjerde-barn-i-barnevernet-har-innvandrarbakgrunn |title=Kvart fjerde barn i barnevernet har innvandrarbakgrunn |language=Norwegian |trans-title=One out of four children in child welfare has an immigrant background |author=T. Dyrhaug |date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Statistics Norway |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 2.2% of all children with Norwegian parents received measures, the corresponding figures were 3.2% for children born in Norway by immigrant parents, and 4.9% for immigrant children. The latter group includes minor [[asylum seeker]]s arriving without parents.

== National and international criticism ==
The Norwegian Child Welfare Services are periodically the subject of public criticism, generally on two main issues. On the one hand, they are criticised for detecting too few cases of parental neglect and helping children too late (i.e., for having a too high threshold for taking action).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forskning.no/barn-og-ungdom/2008/04/svikter-barna-som-trenger-det-mest |title=Svikter barna som trenger det mest |last=Frøjd |first=E.

The Norwegian Child Welfare Services are obliged to ensure the well-being of all children residing in Norway, irrespective of their (or their parents’) nationality.&lt;ref&gt;[[#cwa|Child Welfare Act]], § 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; While Norwegian legislation, following the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], treats children as legal subjects in their own rights, some cultures regard children as the sole responsibility of the family. In several cases, therefore, culture clashes seem to exacerbate conflicts between the Child Welfare Services and immigrant parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manum |first=O.

* [[Pavel Astakhov]], former Russian [[children’s ombudsman]], claimed that the Norwegian Child Welfare Services abducts children from Russia in order to solve "population problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krokfjord |first=T.

* Approximately 4000 people who were formerly taken into custody by the child welfare have sought compensation for suffering and abuse while living in orphanages or foster families between 1945 and 1980.

His point of view was that this was just "cultural difference" and that "it is not easy to understand Norwegian rules for a foreigner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holthe |first=K.H |date=2012-01-23 |title=Diplomatisk drakamp etter barnevernsak i Stavanger |url=http://www.tv2.no/a/3690722|language=no |newspaper=TV2 |location=Bergen |access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berit Aarset, who heads Human Rights Alert, Norway, has called the incident "state kidnapping".  She says, "This is not the first time such a thing is happening in Norway ...the legal system favours the Child Welfare Services and they do what they want all the time... quite often when a Norwegian is married to a non-Norwegian they also do the same thing; they also do this to asylum seekers and in almost every case they say one of the parents has a mental problem just to make their case strong ...that is what has happened in [this] case too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Norway custody row: Top 10 developments |url= http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/norway-custody-row-top-10-developments-178918|access-date=23 February 2012 |newspaper= NDTV |date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In May 2011, the two sons of a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] couple were removed by the Child Welfare Services due to the notifications from school nurses of [[child sexual abuse]] by the father; allegations denied by the couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Mæland | first=Kjetil | title=I Tsjekkia sier de: 'Ikke dra til Norge.

The mother, who has since divorced her husband and continues to reside in Norway, has continued to pursue custody of her children through various channels, including the [[European Court of Human Rights]], where her complaint was rejected without prejudice for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.&lt;ref name="stiznost"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/stiznost-ceske-matky-na-odebrani-deti-v-norsku-soud-strasburk-pbg-/domaci.aspx?c=A141104_141523_domaci_skr | title=Češka, které Norsko odebralo dvě děti, neuspěla ani ve Štrasburku | publisher=Idnes | date=4 November 2014 | access-date=27 December 2014 | work=Z pravy | trans-title=? | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children were separated by social workers and assigned to Norwegian families.

The mother could see her sons twice a year for fifteen minutes. She has however lost her parental rights to both children in 2015, since then she has no right to see them at all. The organization justified its decision among other things by too high media coverage of the case and that they became accustomed to the foster parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Proč vám nevrátíme syny?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8894">'''Nutrient density''' identifies the proportion of [[nutrients]] in foods, with terms such as '''nutrient rich''' and  '''micronutrient dense''' referring to similar properties. Several different national and international standards have been developed and are in use (see [[Nutritional rating systems]]).

==Definition and usage==
According to the [[World Health Organization]], [[nutrient profiling]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010/en/ Nutrient Profiling: Report of a WHO/IASO Technical Meeting, London, United Kingdom, 4-6 October 2010, accessed 10/15/2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; classifies and/or ranks foods by their nutritional composition in order to promote human (and/or animal) health and to prevent disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/profiling/en/ Nutrient Profiling, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ranking by nutrient density is one such nutrient profiling strategy.  Ordering foods by nutrient density is a statistical method of comparing foods by the proportion of nutrients in foods.  Some such comparisons can be the [[glycemic index]] and the [[Overall Nutritional Quality Index]].

Nutrient-dense foods such as [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s are the opposite of [[energy density|energy-dense]] food (also called "[[empty calorie]]" food), such as [[alcohol]] and foods high in added [[sugar]] or processed [[cereals]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/food/nutrition/nutrition/dietary_guide/hgic4062.html Hunter, J. G., Cason, K. L., Nutrient Density, Clemson University, 2006(November), accessed 10/15/2014.  Nutrient density is defined as "a measure of the nutrients provided per calorie of food, or the ratio of nutrients to calories (energy)."]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B758G-4HP5YFV-D/2/c86659719922a2736490366333062119 Darmon, N., Darmon, M., Maillot, M., Drewnowski, A., ''A Nutrient Density Standard for Vegetables and Fruits: Nutrients per Calorie and Nutrients per Unit Cost'', Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 105(12),2005 (December), 1881–1887, DOI: 10.1016/j.jada.2005.09.005, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond its use to distinguish different ''types'' of food from each other, nutrient density allows comparison to be made for different examples or samples of the same kind of food. Nutrient density is correlated with soil quality and mineralization levels of the soil, although the relationship is complex and incorporates other dimensions.

The [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] reported in 2013 that:

==International standards==

The Nutrient Profiling Scoring Calculator (NPSC) in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] is a calculator for determining whether health claims can be made for a food by its reference to the Nutrient Profiling Scoring Criterion (NPSC).  It is defined by the FSANZ Board, which operates under the FSANZ Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/industry/labelling/pages/nutrientprofilingcalculator/Default.aspx FSANZ Board, Nutrient Profiling Scoring Calculator, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom Ofcom nutrient profiling model provides "a single score for any given food product, based on calculating the number of points for ‘negative’ nutrients which can be offset by points for ‘positive’ nutrients."  A 2007 UK-commissioned review of nutrient profiling models commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency identified over 40 different schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publichealth.ox.ac.uk/bhfhprg/publicationsandreports/acad-publications/bhfcpnppublished/nutrientprofilemodel Rayner, M., Scarborough, P., Lobtein, P., The UK Ofcom Nutrient Profiling Model, October 2009, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] reviews scientific and operational issues related to human nutrition, specifically when developing world populations are impacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010/en/ World Health Organization, Nutrient profiling: report of a technical meeting, London, United Kingdom, 4-6 October 2010, 20 pages, Publication date: 2011], {{ISBN|978 92 4 150220 7}}, accessed 10/15/2014, downloadable as a PDF from http://www.who.int/entity/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harperCh4/&gt; Its modern name commemorates [[Cyprian|St. Cyprian]], [[bishop of Carthage]], an early [[Christian]] writer who witnessed and described the plague.&lt;ref name=harperCh4/&gt; The agent of the plague is highly speculative due to sparse sourcing, but suspects include smallpox, pandemic influenza and viral hemorrhagic fever ([[filoviruses]]) like the Ebola virus.&lt;ref name=harper/&gt;&lt;ref name=harperCh4/&gt; 
== Contemporary accounts ==
In 250 to 262, at the height of the outbreak, 5,000 people a day were said to be dying in Rome. Cyprian's biographer, [[Pontius of Carthage]], wrote of the plague at [[Carthage]]:
:"Afterwards there broke out a dreadful plague, and excessive destruction of a hateful disease invaded every house in succession of the trembling populace, carrying off day by day with abrupt attack numberless people, every one from his own house. All were shuddering, fleeing, shunning the contagion, impiously exposing their own friends, as if with the exclusion of the person who was sure to die of the plague, one could exclude death itself also. There lay about the meanwhile, over the whole city, no longer bodies, but the carcasses of many, and, by the contemplation of a lot which in their turn would be theirs, demanded the pity of the passers-by for themselves. No one regarded anything besides his cruel gains. No one trembled at the remembrance of a similar event. No one did to another what he himself wished to experience."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pontius of Carthage]], ''Life of Cyprian''. Transl. Ernest Wallis, c. 1885. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf05.iv.iii.html Online at ''Christian Classics Ethereal Library''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Carthage, the "[[Decian persecution]]", unleashed at the onset of the plague, sought out Christian [[scapegoat]]s. Fifty years later, North African convert to [[Christianity]] [[Arnobius]] defended his new religion from pagan allegations:

:"that a plague was brought upon the earth after the Christian religion came into the world, and after it revealed the mysteries of hidden truth? But pestilences, say my opponents, and droughts, wars, famines, locusts, mice, and hailstones, and other hurtful things, by which the property of men is assailed, the gods bring upon us, incensed as they are by your wrong-doings and by your transgressions." &lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Gentes'' 1.3. Translated by Hamilton Bryce and Hugh Campbell, c. 1885. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf06.xii.iii.i.iii.html Online at ''Christian Classics Ethereal Library''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyprian drew moralizing analogies in his sermons to the Christian community and drew a word picture of the plague's symptoms in his essay ''De mortalitate'' ("On the Plague"):
:"This trial, that now the bowels, relaxed into a constant flux, discharge the bodily strength; that a fire originated in the marrow ferments into wounds of the [[Isthmus of the fauces|fauces]]; that the intestines are shaken with a continual vomiting; that the eyes are on fire with the injected blood; that in some cases the feet or some parts of the limbs are taken off by the contagion of diseased putrefaction; that from the weakness arising by the maiming and loss of the body, either the gait is enfeebled, or the hearing is obstructed, or the sight darkened;—is profitable as a proof of faith. What a grandeur of spirit it is to struggle with all the powers of an unshaken mind against so many onsets of devastation and death! what sublimity, to stand erect amid the desolation of the human race, and not to lie prostrate with those who have no hope in [[God]]; but rather to rejoice, and to embrace the benefit of the occasion; that in thus bravely showing forth our faith, and by suffering endured, going forward to [[Christ]] by the narrow way that Christ trod, we may receive the reward of His life and faith according to His own judgment!" &lt;ref&gt;Cyprian, ''De Mortalitate''. Transl. Ernest Wallis, c. 1885. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf05.iv.v.vii.html Online at ''Christian Classics Ethereal Library''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts of the plague date from about AD 249 to 262.&lt;ref name=harperCh4/&gt; There was a latter incident from 270 involving the death of [[Claudius II Gothicus]], though it's unknown if this was the same plague or a different outbreak.&lt;ref name=harperCh4&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Kyle Harper |year=2017 |page= |chapter=Chapter 4: The Old Age of the World |isbn=978-0691166834}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' says that "in the consulship of [[Flavius Antiochianus|Antiochianus]] and [[Virius Orfitus|Orfitus]]&lt;ref&gt;AD 270.&lt;/ref&gt; the favour of heaven furthered Claudius' success. For a great multitude, the survivors of the barbarian tribes, who had gathered in Haemimontum&lt;ref&gt;[[Mount Haemus]] in the Balkans.&lt;/ref&gt; were so stricken with famine and pestilence that Claudius now scorned to conquer them further.... during this same period the [[Goths|Scythians]] attempted to plunder in Crete and Cyprus as well, but everywhere their armies were likewise stricken with pestilence and so were defeated."

== Epidemiology ==
The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that the people had no previous exposure or [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the plague's cause. Historian [[William Hardy McNeill]] asserts that both the earlier [[Antonine Plague]] (166–180) and the Plague of Cyprian (251–270) were the first transfers from animal hosts to humanity of two different diseases, one of [[smallpox]] and one of [[measles]] although not necessarily in that order. D. Ch. Stathakopoulos asserts that both outbreaks were of smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ch. Stathakopoulos ''Famine and Pestilence in the late Roman and early Byzantine Empire'' (2007) 95&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to historian Kyle Harper, the symptoms attributed by ancient sources to the Plague of Cyprian better match a [[virus|viral disease]] causing a [[hemorrhagic fever]], such as [[ebola]], rather than smallpox. (Conversely, Harper believes that the Antonine Plague was caused by smallpox.)&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Kyle "Pandemics and Passages to Late Antiquity: Rethinking the Plague of c. 249-70 described by Cyprian,” ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' 28 (2015) 223-60.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harper/&gt;&lt;ref name=harperCh4/&gt;

== Legacy ==
According to historian Kyle Harper, the period of the plague nearly saw the end of the Roman Empire. He states that between AD 248 and 268, ".. the history of Roman is a confusing tangle of violent failures. The structural integrity of the imperial machine burst apart. The frontier system crumbled. The collapse of legitimacy invited one usurper after another to try for the throne. The empire fragmented and only the dramatic success of later emperors in putting the pieces back together prevented this moment from being the final act of Roman imperial history."&lt;ref name=harperCh4/&gt;

Many Roman authorities blamed the plague itself on [[Early Christianity|Christianity]]. Despite this, the threat of imminent death from the plague and the unwavering conviction among many of the Christian clergy in the face of it won more converts to the faith.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2377">'''Predictive informatics (PI)''' is the combination of [[predictive modeling]] and [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] applied to healthcare, pharmaceutical, life sciences and business industries.

Predictive informatics enables researchers, analysts, physicians and decision-makers to aggregate and analyze disparate types of data, recognize patterns and trends within that data, and make more informed decisions in an effort to preemptively alter future outcomes.

==Current uses of PI==
===Healthcare===
Over the past decade the increased usage of [[electronic health records]] has produced vast amounts of clinical data that is now computable. Predictive informatics integrates this data with other datasets (e.g., genotypic, phenotypic) in centralized and standardized data repositories upon which predictive analytics may be conducted.

===Pharmaceuticals===
The [[biopharmaceutical]] industry uses predictive informatics (a superset of [[chemoinformatics]]) to integrate information resources to transform data into knowledge in order to make better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization.

===Systems biology===
Scientists involved in [[systems biology]] employ predictive informatics to integrate complex data about the interactions in biological systems from diverse experimental sources.

===Other uses===
Predictive informatics and analytics are also used in financial services, insurance, telecommunications, retail, and travel industries.

{{nihongo|'''Respect for the Aged Day'''|敬老の日|Keirō no Hi}} is a Japanese designated [[public holiday]] celebrated annually to honor [[elderly]] citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planettokyo.com/news/index.cfm/fuseaction/story/ID/94/ |title=What is Respect for the Aged Day? |author= Amy Chavez |accessdate=2008-09-15 |date=2008-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It started in 1966 as a [[Public holiday|national holiday]] and was held on every September 15. Since 2003, Respect for the Aged Day is held on the third Monday of September due to the [[Happy Monday System]].

This national holiday traces its origins to 1947, when Nomadani-mura (later [[Yachiyo, Hyōgo|Yachiyo-cho]], currently [[Taka, Hyōgo|Taka-cho]]), [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], proclaimed September 15 Old Folks' Day (Toshiyori no Hi). Its popularity spread nationwide, and in 1966 it took its present name and status. Annually, [[Japanese media]] take the opportunity to feature the elderly, reporting on the population and highlighting the oldest people in the country.

==Commemorative silver sake cups==
Since 1963, the [[Japanese government]] has given a commemorative silver sake cup to Japanese who reach the age of 100. In 1963 the number was 153, but with numbers increasing, the government decided to reduce the size of the cup to cut costs in 2009.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/03/us-japan-birthday-idUSTRE5220ZP20090303 Ageing Japan cuts cost of 100th birthday gifts March 3, 2009] ''[[Reuters]]'' Retrieved September 26, 2015 &lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 29,357 received a cup.&lt;ref&gt; Izadi, Elahe [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/08/21/japan-has-so-many-super-old-people-that-it-cant-afford-to-give-them-special-sake-cups-anymore/ Japan has so many super old people that it can’t afford to give them special sake cups anymore August 21, 2015] ''[[Washington Post]]'' Retrieved September 26, 2015 &lt;/ref&gt; The cost increase from this led to the government considering making the cups from a different material or simply sending a letter.&lt;ref&gt; Plucinska, Joanna [http://time.com/4004281/japan-centenarian-gift-seniors-day-sakazuki/ Japan Can’t Afford to Give Centenarians Gifts Anymore Because There Are Too Many of Them August 20, 2015] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' Retrieved September 26, 2015 &lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH). He has worked closely with large organisations to develop food safety management systems and training programmes, including CWS Retail Services, [[Marks &amp; Spencer Plc]], [[McDonald's]], The [[De Vere Group]], WRVS, Shell Retail International, HM Prison Catering Services and Gala Retail Services (Ireland). He has provided advice and consultancy services to Governments including the UK Food Standards Agency (The training of Environmental Health Officers regarding the enforcement of the food safety management system for small businesses), such as Safer Food Better Business and the Ministry of Health in Bahrain.

He was the founder member of the Institute of Environmental Health Officer's Food Hygiene Education Working group. In 1982 the CIEH used Sprenger’s Basic and Advanced Food Safety courses he had developed in King's Lynn and with a few minor amendments these became the most popular food safety courses in the UK.He started Highfield.

Sprenger regularly speaks at international conferences. He has been involved in assisting in the training of environmental health officers in the UK, Ireland, Malta, Dubai, Cyprus, Mauritius and the Seychelles. In 2011 he held a workshop in Dubai.&lt;ref name=CCME&gt;

Sprenger has been  based in Dubai since 2010 where he was, at the request of the Dubai Municipality and working closely with Bobby Krishna (the Senior Food Studies and Surveys Officer with the Food Control Department of the Dubai Municipality. responsible for the development and implementation of the very successful Person in Charge Programme. He has also helped run several workshops in Dubai for all stakeholders involved with the PIC programme. In January 2011 this certification programme became compulsory for all food businesses who must have at least one Certified person in charge (PIC) who has been trained in food safety. Sprenger has been responsible for delivering "train the trainer" sessions to over 130 food safety trainers and Dubai Food Inspectors who are responsible for delivering PIC training. In 2011 Sprenger and Bobby Krishna developed the original PIC Handbook and Sprenger designed all of the original PIC training materials including interactive PowerPoint presentations for both Level 2 and Level 3.

Around 12,000 supervisors and managers are trained as PICs each year &lt;ref&gt;

'''Robert Benny Lumsden''' [[Territorial Decoration|TD]], [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCSED]] (1903 – 8 October 1973) was a Scottish [[consultant (medicine)|consultant]] [[Otorhinolaryngology|ear, nose and throat]] (E.N.T.) surgeon.&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/4/5890/495 |title=Obituary - R B Lumsden |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |date=24 November 1973 |page=495 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Lumsden was educated at [[Strathallan School]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] and for a short period at the [[University of Vienna]].&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt; He graduated in medicine (MB, ChB) from Edinburgh in 1926 and became a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] (FRCSED) in 1932.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;

==Surgeon==
After his house appointments Lumsden joined the E.N.T. department of the [[Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh]], where he eventually became honorary consultant.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt; In 1928, he was appointed consultant to the E.N.T. department at [[Forth Valley Royal Hospital|Stirling Royal Infirmary]] and the Deaconess Hospital, Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;

At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Lumsden, already serving with the [[Officers' Training Corps]], was appointed E.N.T. specialist to a field general hospital.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="otc"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=34637 |supp=y |page=4164 |date=20 June 1939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, he was appointed as consultant adviser in E.N.T. to the [[Middle East Command|Middle East Force]].&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt; Lumsden was promoted to captain on 11 April 1945.&lt;ref name="captain"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37303 |supp=y |page=5018 |date=9 October 1945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the Territorial Army Reserve of Officers on 17 April 1955 with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name="retired"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=40506 |supp=y |page=3379 |date=7 June 1955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April 1955, he was awarded the [[Territorial Decoration]] (TD).&lt;ref name="td"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=40463 |supp=y |pages=2471–2472  |date=29 April 1955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lumsden published several papers during his military career detailing some of his medical cases.&lt;ref name="microsoft"&gt;{{AcademicSearch|2641577669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the war, Lumsden spent time in Rome studying the treatment of [[Ménière's disease]] by destruction of the labyrinth of the [[inner ear]] by [[ultrasound]] and in Britain introduced the treatment at the experimental stage.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft" /&gt; While based at the [[David Wilkie (surgeon)|Wilkie]] Surgical Research Institution at the University of Edinburgh he conducted extensive research on the effects of ultrasound on the inner ear.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft" /&gt; Lumsden retired from the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, in 1967.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;

The '''Ross Creek Reservoir''' is an [[artificial lake]] in [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]]. One of the oldest artificial lakes in the country, and the oldest water supply reservoir still in use in the country,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060622180132/http://www.gsnz.org.nz/gs_downloads/fieldtrips/MP116B_FT5.pdf 2003 conference notes, Geological Society of New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt; it was created in the 1860s to provide water for the city of Dunedin, at that time in the middle of rapid expansion due to the [[Otago goldrush]]. Designed by engineer Ralph Donkin and supervising builder [[David Proudfoot]], the reservoir was opened in 1867 as the Royal Albert Reservoir, but the name was unpopular and it has been known as the Ross Creek Reservoir for over a century.

The reservoir, dams, and picturesque valve tower have a [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]] Level I classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{NZHPT|4722|Ross Creek Valve Tower|2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{NZHPT|4922|Ross Creek Earth Dam|2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{stack|[[File:RossCreekReserve.jpg|thumb|200px|Bush tracks surround the reservoir.]]}}
The reservoir is located in a heavily wooded valley in the suburb of [[Glenleith]], four kilometres north of the city centre. Fed by a small stream, the Ross Creek — a tributary of the [[Water of Leith, New Zealand|Water of Leith]] — it is held behind two small dams, 23 metres and 10 metres in height. The base of the larger dam is 95 metres [[above sea level]], with the water surface at approximately 115 metres ASL.

==Ross Creek Reserve==
[[File:SchoolCreekWaterfall.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The School Creek Waterfall was created when the waters of Ross Creek were diverted during construction of the reservoir.]]
The reservoir is surrounded by a public reserve which has been allowed to regenerate with native bush. Though not technically covered by the New Zealand Reserves Act, the area is referred to as a reserve and managed and maintained as such by the [[Dunedin City Council]], by virtue of its high scenic and recreational value.&lt;ref name="Hamel2009"&gt;Hamel, A. (2008) ''Dunedin tracks and Trails.'' Dunedin:Silver Peaks Press. pp. 2.04-06. {{ISBN|978-0-473-13772-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lies between Tanner and Rockside Roads in Glenleith and Cannington Road in [[Maori Hill]]. The winding Burma Road runs through the reserve to the north and west of the reservoir. One of Dunedin's most popular golf courses, [[Balmacewen Golf Course]], abuts the reserve's southwest corner. The highest point in the reserve, in its northeastern corner close to Tanner Road, is some {{convert|190|m|ft}} above sea level.

Numerous popular walking tracks lead to and circle the reservoir, and follow the course of the Ross Creek and its tributary, School Creek. Track counters have recorded as many as 4,000 walkers on the tracks per month, making them some of Dunedin's most well-used bush walks.&lt;ref name="Hamel2009"/&gt; The tracks are marked with stone markers, and a permanent [[orienteering]] course is also marked numbered posts. The walks can be entered from various points along Burma and Tanner Roads, but the main entry is from lower down Ross Creek at Glenleith. A further track links the reserve with a walkway which follows the course of the [[Water of Leith, New Zealand|Water of Leith]] past a former quarry to link with tracks which run through [[Woodhaugh Gardens]] at the mouth of the [[Leith Valley]] {{convert|0.9|km|mi}} to the southeast.

Notable features of the reserve — other than the reservoir — include a waterfall which cascades some {{convert|20|m|ft}} into School Creek. Though these falls appear completely natural, they were created by the diversion of Ross Creek to form the reservoir, and now carry waters from the creek's flood channel. The lower parts of the reserve's tracks close to Glenleith are also notable, as they pass through the narrowest part of the Ross Creek's valley, which rises as canyon walls on both sides of the track and creek.

{{howto|section|date=June 2017}}
To perform the Russian twist, first, one should sit on the floor with knees bent as in a "sit-up" position. The feet should be kept together and slightly above the ground or put under a stable surface. The torso should be kept straight with the back kept off the ground at a 45 degree angle. Arms should be held together away from the body in a straight fashion and hands kept locked together like a ball or one can hold a weight to increase the difficulty. Next, the arms should be swung from one side to another in a twisting motion, with each swing to a side counting as one repetition. The slower one moves the arms from side to side, the harder the exercise becomes, working the abdomen that much better. When moving one's arms during the exercise, it is crucial to not stop between repetitions or else one will lose the effect of working the abdomen. Constant breathing in and out during the exercise is important as one should not hold one's breath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beginnertriathlete.com/cms/article-detail.asp?articleid=1130 Russian Twist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also other variants of this exercise such as using a [[Swiss ball|stability ball]] or with a [[barbell]] standing up.

=== Mason twist ===
The Mason twist is a more advanced (difficult) version of the Russian twist.  It is performed in the same manner, except the legs are straight and the feet are held off the ground (in the V-sit position) for the duration of the exercise. &lt;ref&gt;http://strength.stack52.com/periodic-table-of-bodyweight-exercises/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
Getting a regular [[eye exam]] may play a role in identifying the signs of some systemic diseases. "The eye is composed of many different types of tissue. This unique feature makes the eye susceptible to a wide variety of diseases as well as provides insights into many body systems. Almost any part of the eye can give important clues to the diagnosis of systemic diseases. Signs of a systemic disease may be evident on the outer surface of the eye (eyelids, conjunctiva and cornea), middle of the eye and at the back of the eye (retina)."&lt;ref&gt;"The Eye in Systemic Disease" (University of Illinois at Chicago: 2008), Available at: http://www.uic.edu/com/eye/LearningAboutVision/EyeFacts/SystemicDisease.shtml, Accessed 20 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[500 B.C.]], some researchers have believed that the physical condition of the [[fingernail]]s and [[toenail]]s can indicate various systemic diseases. Careful examination of the fingernails and toenails may provide clues to underlying systemic diseases {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, since some diseases have been found to cause disruptions in the nail growth process. The [[nail plate]] is the hard [[keratin]] cover of the nail. The nail plate is generated by the [[nail matrix]] located just under the cuticle. As the nail grows, the area closest to becoming exposed to the outside world (distal) produces the deeper layers of the nail plate, while the part of the nail matrix deeper inside the finger (proximal) makes the superficial layers. Any disruption in this growth process can lead to an alteration in the shape and texture.

For example, pitting looks like depressions in the hard part of the nail. Pitting is to be associated with [[Psoriasis|psoriasis]], affecting 10% - 50% of patients with that disorder. &lt;ref&gt;Mayeaux EJ Jr. Nail disorders. Prim Care 2000;27: 333-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitting also may be caused by a variety of systemic diseases, including [[reactive arthritis]] and other [[connective tissue disorders]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[pemphigus]], [[alopecia areata]], and [[incontinentia pigmenti]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel CR 3d, Sams WM Jr, Scher RK. Nails in systemic disease. Dermatol Clin 1985;3:465-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Because pitting is caused by defective layering of the superficial nail plate by the proximal nail matrix, any localized dermatitis (e.g., [[atopic|atopic dermatitis]] or chemical [[dermatitis]]) that disrupts orderly growth in that area also can cause pitting.&lt;ref&gt;Eds. ROBERT S. FAWCETT, M.D., M.S., SEAN LINFORD, M.D., and DANIEL L. STULBERG, M.D., ''Nail Abnormalities: Clues to Systemic Disease'' (American Family Physician, March 15, 2004), Available at http://www.aafp.org/afp/20040315/1417.html, Accessed 20 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tabagie''' is a room designated for smoking tobacco and socializing.

{{blockquote|''In every Palace was a Tabagie, a high large room with a dozen contented saturnine figures round a large long table, a long Dutch pipe in the mouth of each.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guide To Carlyle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RU_GwuvGRq0C&amp;pg=PA184|accessdate=7 July 2013|publisher=Ardent Media|pages=184–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In modern [[Quebec French]], ''tabagie'' refers to a [[tobacco shop]], which in [[Parisian French]] is called a ''bureau de tabac''.&lt;ref name="SchmidtWilliams2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dodi-Katrin Schmidt|author2=Michelle M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3231">'''The Institute of Optometry''' is a centre for [[optometry]], based in south London, England. It was  established in 1922 as the '''London Refraction Hospital'''.

==History==
===London Refraction Hospital===
The London Refraction Hospital (LRH) was formed in October 1922, the first institute of its kind in the world. The first committee of management consisted of Owen Aves (Chairman), F.W. Bateman, J.H. Cuff, F.W. Dadd, G.E. Houghton and W. H. Nichols. The first secretary was F.T. Gregg.&lt;ref name=Hardy/&gt; James Forrest, who was a [[oculist|surgeon oculist]], was also involved in the founding.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. (1997), The Institute of Optometry: 75 years, ''British Journal of Optometry and Dispensing'', volume 5, number 3, page 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lib&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalog entry: The London Refraction Hospital. Its history and work 1922 - 1943|url=https://museum.aco.org.au/archive/870-the-london-refraction-hospital-its-history-and-work-1922-1943|publisher=Cyril Kett Museum and Archive|accessdate=16 March 2018|language=en-gb|date=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LRH was enlarged and re-modelled in October 1928 and re-opened in February 1929 by the Rt. Hon. the Countess of Mayo. In November 1938 the LRH was reconstituted by order of the Charity Commission.&lt;ref name=Hardy&gt;Hardy, W.E. and Hogg, A.E., eds. (1943), ''The London Refraction Hospital: Its History and Work 1922-1943'', Borough Press, London, pages 1-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Lord Charnwood was active in the management of the London Refraction Hospital after the second world war.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. (1999), The 2nd Lord Charnwood (1901-1955), a distinguished optometrist, ''British Journal of Optometry and Dispensing'', volume 7, number 3, page 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 it was suggested by Rishi Agarwal in Optometry Today that 'in addition to making efforts for a Royal [[College of Optometrists]], efforts should also be made for a Royal status for the LRH.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R (1985), Royal LRH? Optometry Today, vol 25, number 11, page 374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, P. (1983), The Editor's Round, Optician, vol 185, number 3, page 92. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute of Optometry===
In 1988 the LRH changed its name to the Institute of Optometry.&lt;ref name=Lib/&gt;

In 2008 the Institute of Optometry, in partnership with [[London South Bank University]], established a post-graduate Doctor of Optometry programme. This was the first professional doctorate in optometry by that description offered in the UK, distinct from a traditional PhD.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. (2008), Integrating theory with practice, ''Optician'', volume 236, number 6167, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. (2014), Developing the doctorate, ''Optician'', volume 247, number 6439, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Malaria]]''' is an infectious disease caused by a parasite; it is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Every year, 300 to 700 million people get infected. Malaria kills 1 million to 2 million people every year. 90% of the deaths occur in Africa.&lt;ref name=WHO15&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaria Fact sheet N°94|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of [[tobacco]] are used in [[Afghanistan]]. [[Cigarette smoking]] and ''[[naswar]]'' or [[moist snuff]] which is used through mouth and nose. Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CDC|title=GYTS|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/global/gtss/tobacco_atlas/pdfs/part3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in schools of five provinces of Afghanistan showed high exposure to second hand smoke.

Another unpublished study by Welayatee et all in general population of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, showed high prevalence of cigarette smoking among males aged 18 years and older. Naswar was another common form of tobacco used by adult males.

'''Translational research''' – often used interchangeably with '''translational medicine''' or '''translational science''' or '''bench to bedside''' – is an effort to build on [[basic research|basic scientific research]] to create new [[therapies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Mahla RS| title = Stem Cells Applications in Regenerative Medicine and Disease Therapeutics | journal = International Journal of Cell Biology  | volume = 2016 | issue = 7 | pages = 19 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27516776 | doi = 10.1155/2016/6940283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[medical procedure]]s, or [[diagnostic]]s.  Basic [[biomedical research]] is based on studies of [[pathophysiology|disease processes]] using for example [[cell culture]]s or [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref name="Cohrs 86–88" /&gt; The term translational refers to the "translation" of basic scientific findings in a laboratory setting into potential treatments for disease.&lt;ref name="Woolf_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woolf SH | title = The meaning of translational research and why it matters | journal = JAMA | volume = 299 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–3 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18182604 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2007.26 | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2007.26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reis SE, Berglund L, Bernard GR, Califf RM, Fitzgerald GA, Johnson PC | title = Reengineering the national clinical and translational research enterprise: the strategic plan of the National Clinical and Translational Science Awards Consortium | journal = Academic Medicine | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 463–9 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20182119 | pmc = 2829722 | doi = 10.1097/acm.0b013e3181ccc877 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2011/04/careers-clinical-and-translational-research|title=Careers in Clinical and Translational Research| author = Science Careers Staff | date=2011|work=Science|access-date=March 24, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/factsheets/translating/index.html|title=Translating Research Into Practice|last=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|first=|date=2017|website=www.ahrq.gov|language=en-us|access-date=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Translational medicine is defined by the European Society for Translational Medicine (EUSTM) as "an interdisciplinary branch of the biomedical field supported by three main pillars: benchside, bedside and community."&lt;ref name="Cohrs 86–88"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Translational Medicine definition by the European Society for Translational Medicine | journal = New Horizons in Translational Medicine|pages = 86–88|volume = 2|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.nhtm.2014.12.002|first = Randall J.|last = Cohrs|first2 = Tyler|last2 = Martin|first3 = Parviz|last3 = Ghahramani|first4 = Luc|last4 = Bidaut |first5 = Paul J.|last5 = Higgins|first6 = Aamir|last6 = Shahzad | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is defined for school-based education by the Education Futures Collaboration (www.meshguides.org) as research which translates concepts to classroom practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burden|first1=Kevin|last2=Younie|first2=Sarah|last3=Leask|first3=Marilyn | name-list-format = vanc |title=Translational research principles applied to education: the mapping educational specialist knowhow (MESH) initiative|journal=Journal of Education for Teaching|date=October 2013|volume=39|issue=4|pages=459–463|doi=10.1080/02607476.2013.801216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of translational research are commonly found in education subject association journals and in the MESHGuides which have been designed for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Younie S | date = 2016 | chapter = Mapping Educational Specialist knowHow (MESH) | title = International Teacher Education Knowledge Mobilisation Summit: a framework for UNESCO SDG4 2030 | publisher = Whitehall | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translational research applies findings from basic science to enhance human health and well-being. In a medical research context, it aims to "translate" findings in fundamental research into medical practice and meaningful health outcomes. Translational research implements a "bench-to-bedside", from laboratory experiments through clinical trials to point-of-care patient applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Translational Science|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1149350|website=tuftsctsi.org|publisher=Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute|access-date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; model, harnessing knowledge from basic sciences to produce new drugs, devices, and treatment options for patients. The end point of translational research is the production of a promising new treatment that can be used with practical applications, that can then be used clinically or are able to be commercialized.&lt;ref name="Woolf_2008" /&gt;

As a relatively new research discipline, translational research incorporates aspects of both basic science and clinical research, requiring skills and resources that are not readily available in a basic laboratory or clinical setting.  It is for these reasons that translational research is more effective in dedicated university science departments or isolated, dedicated research centers.&lt;ref name="pmid11689456"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pober JS, Neuhauser CS, Pober JM | title = Obstacles facing translational research in academic medical centers | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 13 | pages = 2303–13 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11689456 | doi = 10.1096/fj.01-0540lsf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, the field has had specialized journals, the ''[[American Journal of Translational Research]]'' and ''[[Translational Research (journal)|Translational Research]]'' dedicated to translational research and its findings.

Translational research is broken down into different stages, including two-stage (T1 and T2), four-stage (T1, T2, T3, and T4), and five-stage (T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5) schemes. In a two-stage model, ''T1 research'', refers to the "bench-to-bedside" enterprise of translating knowledge from the basic sciences into the development of new treatments and ''T2 research'' refers to translating the findings from clinical trials into everyday practice.&lt;ref name="Woolf_2008"/&gt; In a five-stage scheme, T1 involves basic research, T2 involves pre-clinical research, T3 involves clinical research, T4 involves clinical implementation, and T5 involves implementation in the public health sphere. Waldman et al. propose a scheme going from T0 to T5. T0 is laboratory (before human) research. In T1-translation, new laboratory discoveries are first translated to human application, which includes phase I &amp; II clinical trials. In T2-translation, candidate health applications progress through clinical development to engender the evidence base for integration into clinical practice guidelines. This includes phase III clinical trials. In T3-translation, dissemination into community practices happens. T4-translation seeks to (1) advance scientific knowledge to paradigms of disease prevention, and (2) move health practices established in T3 into population health impact. Finally, T5-translation focuses on improving the wellness of populations by reforming suboptimal social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldman|first=Scott A.|last2=Terzic|first2=Andre|date=2010-10-01|title=Clinical and Translational Science: From Bench-Bedside to Global Village|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1752-8062.2010.00227.x|journal=Clinical and Translational Science|language=en|volume=3|issue=5|pages=254–257|doi=10.1111/j.1752-8062.2010.00227.x|issn=1752-8062}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a two-stage scheme, translational research includes two areas of translation. One is the process of applying discoveries generated during research in the laboratory, and in preclinical studies, to the development of trials and studies in humans. The second area of translation concerns research aimed at enhancing the adoption of best practices in the community. Cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies is also an important part of translational science.&lt;ref name="Woolf_2008"/&gt;

== Comparison to basic research or applied research ==
[[Basic research]] is the systematic study directed toward greater [[knowledge]] or understanding of the fundamental aspects of [[phenomena]] and is performed without thought of practical ends. It results in general knowledge and understanding of nature and its laws.&lt;ref&gt;"What is basic research?" (PDF). National Science Foundation. Retrieved 2014-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied research is a form of systematic inquiry involving the practical application of [[science]]. It accesses and uses the research communities' accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, often state, [[commerce|business]], or [[customer|client-driven]] purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|last = Roll-Hansen|first=Nils | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/CPNSS/research/concludedResearchProjects/ContingencyDissentInScience/DP/DPRoll-HansenOnline0409.pdf|title = Why the distinction between basic (theoretical) and applied (practical) research is important in the politics of science|date=April 2009|access-date = November 30, 2013|format = PDF|publisher = The London School of Economics and Political Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medicine, translational research is increasingly a separate research field. A citation pattern between the applied and basic sides in cancer research appeared around 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cambrosio A, Keating P, Mercier S, Lewison G, Mogoutov A | title = Mapping the emergence and development of translational cancer research | journal = European Journal of Cancer | volume = 42 | issue = 18 | pages = 3140–8 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17079135 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejca.2006.07.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges and criticisms ==
Critics of translational research point to examples of important drugs that arose from fortuitous discoveries in the course of basic research such as [[penicillin]] and [[benzodiazepines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tone|first=Andrea|title=The Age of Anxiety: the History of America's Love Affairs with Tranquilizers|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the importance of basic research in improving our understanding of basic biological facts (e.g. the function and structure of [[DNA]]) that go on to transform applied medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/2012/11/26/the-perils-of-translational-research/|title=The perils of translational research|date=November 26, 2012|author=Ashutosh Jogalekar|work=Scientific American Blog Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of failed translational research in the pharmaceutical industry include the failure of anti-aβ therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Golde TE, Schneider LS, Koo EH | title = Anti-aβ therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease: the need for a paradigm shift | journal = Neuron | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–13 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21262461 | pmc = 3058906 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.01.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other problems have stemmed from the widespread irreproducibility thought to exist in translational research literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prinz F, Schlange T, Asadullah K | title = Believe it or not: how much can we rely on published data on potential drug targets? | journal = Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 712 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21892149 | doi = 10.1038/nrd3439-c1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
In U.S., the [[National Institutes of Health]] has implemented a major national initiative to leverage existing academic health center infrastructure through the Clinical and Translational Science Awards. 
The [[National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences]] (NCATS) was established on December 23, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctsaweb.org/|title=Новости Мюнхена и Германии |website=CTSA Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although translational research is relatively new, it is being recognized and embraced globally. Some major centers for translational research include:
* About 60 hubs of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinical and Translational Science Awards Program Hubs|url=http://www.ncats.nih.gov/ctsa/about/hubs|website=www.ncats.nih.gov|publisher=National Institutes for Health|access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Translational Research Institute (Australia)]], [[Brisbane, Queensland]], [[Australia]].
* [[Stanford University Medical Center]], [[Stanford, California]], United States.
* [[Translational Genomics Research Institute]], [[Phoenix, Arizona]], United States.
* [[Maine Medical Center]] in [[Portland, Maine]], United States has a dedicated translational research institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maine Medical Center Research Institute attracts top scientists, licenses discoveries|url=http://www.mainebiz.biz/article/20150615/CURRENTEDITION/306119996/maine-medical-center-research-institute-attracts-top-scientists-licenses-discoveries|website=www.mainebiz.biz|publisher=Mainebiz|access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, translational research is now acknowledged by some universities as a dedicated field to study a PhD or graduate certificate in, in a medical context. These institutes currently include [[Monash University]] in [[Victoria, Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Translational Research – PhD and Graduate Certificate|url=http://www.med.monash.edu.au/cecs/education/translational-research.html |website=www.med.monash.edu.au |publisher=Monash University|access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Queensland]], Diamantina Institute in [[Brisbane, Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MPhil in Translational Research|url= http://www.di.uq.edu.au/mphil-translational-research |website=www.di.uq.edu.au|publisher=University of Queensland Diamantina Institute|access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]], [[United States|America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinical and Translational Research|url=http://medschool.duke.edu/research/clinical-and-translational-research|website=medschool.duke.edu|publisher=Duke University|access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Creighton University]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Clinical and Translational Science|url=http://medschool.creighton.edu/medicine/centers/cts/|website=medschool.creighton.edu|publisher=Creighton University|access-date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certificate Program in Translational|url=http://www.gs.emory.edu/sites/translational/|publisher=Emory University|access-date=4 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The industry and academic interactions to promote translational science initiatives has been carried out by various global centers such as [[European Commission]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[Novartis]] Institute for [[Biomedical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpharmanews.com/novartis/1858-novartis-appoints-timothy-wright-md-as-global-head-development-novartis-pharmaceuticals|title=Novartis|work=World Pharma News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1992 Flxible Metro bus with wheelchair lift fully raised.jpg|thumb|A wheelchair lift in the front door of a city bus in Portland, Oregon, in 2010]]
A '''wheelchair lift''', also known as a '''platform lift''', or '''vertical platform lift''' is a fully powered device designed to raise a [[wheelchair]] and its occupant in order to overcome a step or similar vertical barrier.

Wheelchair lifts can be installed in homes or businesses and are often added to both private and public vehicles in order to meet accessibility requirements laid out by disability acts. These mobility devices are often installed in homes as an alternative to a [[stair lift]], which only transport a passenger and not his/her wheelchair or [[mobility scooter]].

In the United States, the  [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) required that all new [[mass transit]] vehicles placed into service after July&amp;nbsp;1, 1993, be accessible to persons in wheelchairs,&lt;ref name="getting on board"&gt;"Getting on board" (July–August 1993). ''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 190, pp. 86–87. National Trolleybus Association (UK). {{ISSN|0266-7452}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and until the 2000s, this requirement was most commonly met by the inclusion of a wheelchair lift.  In 1993, 29,033 [[transit bus]]es in the U.S. were equipped with a wheelchair lift or [[Wheelchair ramp|ramps]], 52 percent of all U.S. transit buses.&lt;ref name="BTS 2003"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lift- or Ramp-Equipped Buses and Rail Stations|work=Transportation Statistics Annual Report, 2003 |url=https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/transportation_statistics_annual_report/2003/html/chapter_02/lift-_or_ramp-equipped_buses_and_rail_stations.html |publisher=[[Bureau of Transportation Statistics]]|accessdate=2017-06-09|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2001, this figure had grown to 58,785 buses (but the percentage that were equipped with lifts, as opposed to ramps, is not known).&lt;ref name="BTS 2003"/&gt;

[[Low-floor]] transit vehicles (buses, [[Tram|streetcar]]s, [[light rail]] cars) – fitted with ramps or [[Bridge plate (mechanism)|bridge plates]] rather than lifts – later began to become more common than lifts for heavy-duty transit vehicles, while lifts continued to be used in [[paratransit]] vehicles.

A number of legal regimes in various countries regulate the use of wheelchair lifts, setting forth standards for the devices and requiring certain kinds of businesses to make parking lots accessible to vehicles bearing the devices. In some instances, accessibility standards have been achieved in [[legal settlement]]s. For example, in the 2005 case of ''Dilworth, et al. v. City of [[Detroit]]'', NO. 2:04- cv-73152 ([[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|E.D. Mich.]] 2005), the defendant city conceded that the [[Americans With Disabilities Act]] and its supporting legislation required the city "to maintain the wheelchair lifts on its buses in operative condition; promptly repair wheelchair lifts if they are damaged or out of order; establish a system of regular and frequent maintenance checks of wheelchair lifts; remove a vehicle from service if the lift is inoperative (with limited exceptions); provide alternative transportation when the lift doesn't work and the next accessible bus is more than 30 minutes away."

While some [[wheelchair accessible van|wheelchair-accessible van]]s use a powered lift to assist the occupant in boarding, a [[wheelchair ramp]] is usually less expensive for this purpose and is often installed on minivans. Full-size vans require the use of a platform lift. There are two types of platform lifts installed on [[wheelchair accessible van|wheelchair-accessible van]]s: single-arm and dual-arm. Single-arm wheelchair lifts are only used in side-entry applications. They take up less interior space and leave the passenger entry open; however, they have less lifting capacity than dual-arm lifts. Most dual-arm wheelchair lifts have a lift capacity up to 800 pounds. These lifts consume more interior space and block the side entry and, for these reasons, are often mounted in the back of the vehicle for rear-entry applications.

As mandated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), [[wheelchair accessible van|wheelchair-accessible van]]s with wheelchair lifts are equipped with a safety lift interlock. Designed to prevent operation of the wheelchair van or wheelchair lift in unsafe situations, the safety interlock will sound an alarm if an unsafe condition exists (e.g., the vehicle attempts to move while the lift is deployed) or prevent the vehicle from shifting into drive while the wheelchair lift is in operation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/Rulemaking/Rules/Associated%20Files/Lift_FinalRule_Dec-27-02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent innovations have allowed for the development of wheelchair lifts which assist people in entering truck cabs, so that they may drive or operate heavy equipment. Wheelchair lifts can also be used to move an unoccupied scooter into a vehicle.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Indoor vs outdoor vertical lifts ==
An indoor vertical platform lift operates much like an elevator which is installed within a hoist-way or shaft-way. Although the installation of a vertical platform lift is similar to that of an elevator, it's much less expensive. Some models, such as the Savaria V-1504 hydraulic lift, offer options to finish a vertical platform lift to make it operate more like a home elevator.

An outdoor vertical platform may include factory-built enclosures that protect the user from the weather and keep them dry. The enclosure acts as a shaft-way inside the unit with gates or doors that are added to the entrance or exit.

'''Éric A. Cohen''' (born March 19, 1958) is a Canadian molecular [[virologist]] whose research is focused on [[human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]]-host interactions that govern viral replication and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ircm.qc.ca/LARECHERCHE/axes/Immunite/Humaine/Pages/Projets.aspx?PFLG=1033&amp;lan=1033&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://expmed.mcgill.ca/researcher?id=146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/49229.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and Training==
Cohen graduated from [[Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf]] of Montréal in 1977 with a college diploma in Health Sciences. He received a B.Sc. in [[Biochemistry]] from [[McGill University]] in 1981 and a Ph.D. in [[Molecular Biology]] from [[Université de Montréal]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recherche.umontreal.ca/en/research-at-udem/our-professors/profile/chercheur/404/pid/16/&lt;/ref&gt;

As a Ph.D. student, he worked on fundamental aspects of [[herpes simplex virus]] replication and transformation under the direction of  Yves Langelier.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recherche.umontreal.ca/en/research-at-udem/our-professors/profile/chercheur/404/pid/16/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986,  he joined the laboratory of [[William A. Haseltine]] at the [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] and [[Harvard Medical School]] as a postdoctoral fellow, working on fundamental aspects of HIV structure and function to uncover new targets for [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiviral therapy]].  His postdoctoral work led to the identification of two [[Structure and genome of HIV|HIV-1 non-structural proteins]], named [[vpu|Viral Protein U (Vpu)]] and [[Vpr|Viral Protein R (Vpr)]], part of a new class of retroviral proteins - designated accessory proteins - that are required for optimal virus multiplication and dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recherche.umontreal.ca/en/research-at-udem/our-professors/profile/chercheur/404/pid/16/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and Research==
In 1990,  Cohen became a Faculty member of the  Department of Microbiology, Infectiology and Immunology at Université de Montréal  and was appointed Professor of Virology in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://microbiologie.umontreal.ca/recherche/professeurs-chercheurs/eric-cohen/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he joined the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal, where he is currently pursuing research aimed at understanding HIV persistence and identifying intervention strategies for an HIV cure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ircm.qc.ca/LARECHERCHE/Axes/Immunite/humaine/Pages/Biographie.aspx?PFLG=1033&amp;lan=1033&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohen's laboratory has contributed to describing the structure and function of Vpr during HIV-1 infection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=eec70815-fdaf-4012-bd32-7671fa27430d&amp;k=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=e3509527-9813-4b1f-af58-200ad27d7d8c&amp;sponsor&lt;/ref&gt; His work was also involved in defining Vpr as a viral factor with immune-modulatory functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jvi.asm.org/content/85/23/12254.long Pham T.N., J.

Cohen has investigated the role and function of Vpu in HIV pathogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cahr-acrv.ca/featured-researchers/cohen/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-07/idrc-hut071515.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/science/2015/07/16/002-vih-sida-strategie-immunitare-ircm.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/07/16/vih-chercheurs-montrealais-decouverte-importante_n_7813414.html&lt;/ref&gt; His laboratory demonstrated that Vpu enables the optimal production and dissemination of the virus and helped shed light on the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which Vpu counteracts BST2 (also designated [[Tetherin]]), an [[interferon]]-regulated [[host factor]] that strongly inhibits the release and transmission of HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000856 Dube M., B.B.

PLoS Pathog. 6:e1000856.]{{PMID|20386718}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cohen's work also showed that Vpu plays a key part in the negative regulation of the [[CD4]] receptor observed during HIV infection and that the antagonistic actions of Vpu on CD4 and BST2 are among the strategies employed by HIV to circumvent several types of anti-HIV immune responses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/75 Binette J., M.
