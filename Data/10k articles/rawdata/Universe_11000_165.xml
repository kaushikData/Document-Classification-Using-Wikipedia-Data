The '''2002 Eastern Mediterranean Event''' was a high-energy [[upper atmosphere]] [[explosion]] over the [[Mediterranean Sea]], around 34°N 21°E (between [[Libya]] and [[Crete]]) on June 6, 2002.&lt;ref name="USSC"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[United States Space Command]] |title=Speech by Gen. Simon Worden: "Military Perspectives on the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Threat" |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=8834 | work=SpaceRef | date=2002-07-15 |quote=Had you been situated on a vessel directly underneath the intensely bright flash would have been followed by a shock wave that would have rattled the entire ship and possibly caused minor damage. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This explosion, similar in power to a small [[atomic bomb]], has been related to a small [[Near-Earth object|asteroid]] undetected while approaching [[Earth]]. The object disintegrated in an [[air burst]] impact and no meteorite fragments were recovered. The air burst occurred over the sea.

The event occurred during the [[2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff]], and there were concerns by General [[Pete Worden|Simon Worden]] of the U.S. Air Force that if the upper atmosphere explosion had occurred closer to [[Pakistan]] or [[India]], it could have sparked a [[nuclear war]] between the two countries.&lt;ref name="spacedaily"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/deepimpact-02s.html | title=Near-Earth Objects Pose Threat, General Says | work=Space Daily | publisher= | date=2002-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1957">The '''Albrecht effect''' describes how [[cloud condensation nuclei]] (CCN), possibly from anthropogenic pollution, may increase cloud lifetime and hence increase the amount of solar radiation reflected from clouds. Because it does not directly interact with incoming or outgoing radiation, it has an indirect effect on climate.

Aerosol particles act as CCNs creating more droplets of a smaller size. These take more time to coalesce to raindrop size (&gt;100μm), reducing precipitation efficiency and hence increasing the lifetime of the cloud. The increased scattering of incoming radiation leads to a cooling of -0.3 to -1.4 Wm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC 4th Assessment Report, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is not as well understood as the [[Twomey effect]].

There are many other effects, indirect and semi-direct aerosol effects resulting in a large uncertainty in the radiative forcing due to aerosols.

[[File:Record Jules Verne 26 01 2017 102.jpg|thumb|''[[IDEC 3]]'', current outright record holder at 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds.]]
The first '''around the world sailing record''' for [[circumnavigation]] of the world was [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] and the remaining members of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s crew who completed their journey in 1522. The first solo record was set by [[Joshua Slocum]] in the [[Spray (sailing vessel)|''Spray'']] (1898).

Most races or solo attempts start from Europe. Due to the configuration of the continents, sailing around the world consists of sailing on the [[Southern Ocean]] around the [[Antarctica]] continent, passing south of [[Cape Horn]], [[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[Cape Leeuwin]]. Since 1918 the [[Panama Canal]] is an option but the [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] must be entered and exited using engine power. Large stretches of the canal can be crossed under sail power.

Sailing around the world can be done by two directions: eastward or westward. The dominant winds and currents (outside tropical areas) make the voyage eastwards on the Southern hemisphere faster, most skippers and yachts who race prefer this route. Today, the [[multihull]]s perform much better than [[monohulls]] and hold the best times. Leisure yacht skippers who prefer tropical seas more often go westward, using the [[trade wind]]s (and the [[Panama canal]]).

The most famous races around the world are:
* The [[Vendée Globe]] a non-stop solo round the currently run using the [[IMOCA 60]] Class.
* The [[Volvo Ocean Race]] a stopping fully crewed race currently using the [[Volvo Ocean 65]] previously known as the Whitbread Round the World Race.
* The [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race]] a stopping solo round the currently run using the [[IMOCA 60]] Class previously known as the BOC Challenge, later as Around Alone.
* The [[Barcelona World Race]] a non-stop two handed race currently run using the [[IMOCA 60]] Class.
* The [[Clipper Round the World Yacht Race]] a stopping race crewed round the World Race for amateur crews using the [[Clipper Round the World Yacht Race#Clipper 70|Clipper 70]] Class

Former races including:
* The [[Sunday Times Golden Globe Race]], held in 1968-1969, the first round-the-world yacht race.
* The BT [[Global Challenge]], was a race held every four years and followed the westward route.
* [[The Race (yachting race)|The Race]], was a race held in 2000, involving multihulls.
* The [[Oryx Quest]], held in 2005, starting from [[Qatar]].

The [[Jules Verne Trophy]] is awarded to the skipper who breaks the outright record, starting from an imaginary line between the [[Phare du Creach|Créac'h lighthouse]] on Ouessant ([[Ushant]]) Island, [[France]], and the [[Lizard Lighthouse]], [[United Kingdom|UK]].

The records are homologated by the [[World Sailing Speed Record Council]] (WSSRC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sailspeedrecords.com/round-the-world-non-stop.html round the world records] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927171730/http://www.sailspeedrecords.com/round-the-world-non-stop.html |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the WSSRC, for around the world sailing records, there is a rule saying that the length must be at least 21,600&amp;nbsp;nmi calculated along the shortest possible track from the starting port and back that does not cross land and does not go below 63°S. The [[great-circle distance]] formulas are to be used, assuming that the great circle length is 21,600&amp;nbsp;nmi. It is allowed to have one single [[waypoint]] to lengthen the calculated track. The equator must be crossed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sailspeedrecords.com/the-courses-offshore ISAF/World Sailing Speed Record Rules for individually attempted Passage Records or Performances Offshore]&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, this means that the boat should pass a waypoint at or not far from the [[Antipodes|antipode]] of the starting port of the journey (the exact position depends on how short the shortest possible track is). For example, the [[Vendée Globe]] starts at 46°N 2°W, has a waypoint at 57°S 180°E, and barely makes the distance requirement. The participants don't have to go to the antipode at 46°S 178°E since the rounding of Africa gives extra distance.

''Carica stipulata'', "Toronche".).

==Growth==
It can grow at high altitudes (over 2,000 m), and is the most cold-tolerant plant in the genus ''Vasconcellea''. The babaco is classified as a herbaceous shrub like ''[[Papaya|Carica papaya]]'' (pawpaw or papaya) but unlike papaya it produces only female flowers. The babaco plant can produce from 30–60 fruits annually, and has an average life span of about eight years.  The small plant is better suited as a container specimen than its cousin the [[papaya]], which needs constant moisture and high temperatures to survive.

The babaco is suitable for greenhouse cultivation, where it produces high-quality fruit with soft edible skin. The plant is easy to cultivate under greenhouse conditions (Kempler et al., 1993). Propagation of the plant is achieved by rooting axillary shoots. Stem sections root poorly. The opening of axillary buds and subsequent shoot growth is stimulated by removing the apical meristem. The shoots are cut at 15–25&amp;nbsp;cm long and only the apical leaf is kept. The basal area of the stem is mildly injured and dipped in 0.4% IBA rooting powder and planted into suitable rooting media such as peat:perlite:sand and placed under intermittent mist. The cutting can be ready for transplanting within 3 weeks.

In contrast to the tropical papaya, babaco require a cool subtropical climate. Recommended greenhouse minimum temperature of 10&amp;nbsp;°C at night, 12&amp;nbsp;°C during the day, and 18&amp;nbsp;°C for fruit to ripen quickly and uniformly. Excessively low temperatures cause fruit to mature with rough, pitted skin.

The flowering habit is indeterminate. Under greenhouse conditions, plant growth during winter month (October- March at 49°N) is slow, and flowers senesce and fail to set fruit (Kempler et al., 1993). In Ecuador, the trees begin cropping 10 months after planting and continue bearing for 6 months, producing about 40 fruit/tree with each weighing about 1-1.5&amp;nbsp;kg, in the greenhouse we produced about 32&amp;nbsp;kg fruit per square meter in 16 months when planted 0.8 plants per sq. meter, and 25&amp;nbsp;kg sq. meter after 12 months space at 3 plants sq. meter. Because of the heavy fruit load a support system for the plants was required. Small fruit size can be achieved by growing plants at high densities. Fruit begins to mature with gradual color change from green to yellow and, if harvest it delayed, the fruit stalk will abscise and fruit will drop and bruise. The delicate-skinned fruit is harvested with pruners with a short stalk and handled carefully. In northern climate, ripening begins in November (March planting), and continues until June. During this period new flowers are set (April–September) and the second crop starts to ripen in November, the plant is cut above the last-formed fruit as flowers senesce in October. After the end of the second season, cropping plants can be cut and rejuvenated from the base or replaced with new plants.

==Characteristics==
It is a small, unbranched or sparsely branched [[tree]] reaching 5–8&amp;nbsp;m tall. The [[fruit]] differs from the related [[papaya]] (''C. papaya'') in being narrower, typically less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. The babaco fruit is seedless and the smooth skin can be eaten, and is said to have tastes of strawberry, papaya, kiwi and pineapple. The fruit is pentagonal in shape, therefore giving it the scientific name of ''Carica pentagona''. The fruit is not especially acidic, but contains [[papain]], a [[proteolytic enzyme]], which may cause mild irritation or "burns".

Like the papaya, the babaco is grown for its edible fruit and for its [[juice|fruit juice]]. Cultivation away from its native range has been successful as far south as [[New Zealand]], and as far north as [[California]], some regions of [[England]], [[Guernsey]], [[Channel Islands]], and somewhat also in [[Italy]] (mostly [[Sicily]] and [[Calabria]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5386">The '''Blau Monuments''' are a pair of inscribed stone objects from [[Mesopotamia]] now in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/the_blau_monuments.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; They are commonly thought to be a form of ancient [[kudurru]].&lt;ref&gt;Gelb, “Earliest Land Tenure Systems”&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Monuments were purchased by A. Blau in 1886 near the city of [[Uruk]] (modern-day [[Iraq]]). They were carved of bright blue stone commonly regarded as a dark shale or kind of schist.&lt;ref&gt;Gelb&lt;/ref&gt; Thought to be forgeries for some time,&lt;ref&gt;Mallowan, “Early Mesopotamia and Iran”&lt;/ref&gt; excavations at Uruk redeemed them through revealing stylistic parallels in a basalt stele and the famous [[Warka Vase]].  Some assyriologists accepted the Monuments’ authenticity as early as 1901, although this was not a universal belief.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, “Some Notes on the Blau Monuments.” Journal of the American Oriental Society&lt;/ref&gt; Even though widely accepted today, some authors nonetheless maintain scrutiny on the Monuments’ status within [[Mesopotamia]]n history.

==Dating==
The Blau Monuments are dated within the [[Jemdet Nasr period|Uruk III/Jemdet Nasr]] to [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer|Early Dynastic I period]]. Some authors date the pair as early as 3100 BC on the basis of the proto-cuneiform script, while others date them to the ED I period around 2700 BC because of other stylistically similar land sale records with a definite date in the ED I period.&lt;ref&gt;Barton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallowan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gelb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millard, “Books in the Late Bronze Age in the Levant”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postgate, “Early Mesopotamia”&lt;/ref&gt; Both dates are equally represented in scholarly works; the majority of works citing the earliest date usually reference Gelb in their turn.

==Imagery==
The iconography on the Monuments is a matter of some dispute, upon which even recent scholars cannot wholly agree. Throughout their history, it has been consistently believed that the Monuments represented some form of transaction, usually in the form of a gift from a temple to its craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Mallowan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, “Fifty Masterpieces of Ancient Near Eastern Art”&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the imagery has been taken to represent a ceremonial feast given by a new land-owner after a land sale.&lt;ref&gt;Gelb&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obelisk===
The obelisk shows male forms in two separate registers. The lower figure is a nude male who kneels with a pestle and mortar, which could suggest equally craftsmen or food preparation. He has parallels on the Warka Vase, where likewise nude males carry baskets of food for religious purposes. In the upper register, a standing man with a beard, bordered net-skirt, and headband holds a four-legged animal in his hands (usually identified as either a sheep or a goat). This figure is a very common way throughout Mesopotamian art of depicting a male with power.

===Plaque===
The plaque’s obverse shows a similarly hierarchical scene. The leftmost figure is another bearded, skirted man. He holds a long object with both hands. This object has been interpreted as a pestle or a land-sale cone; when compared to the workers elsewhere on the Monuments who are working with pestles, the former identification seems unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, R.E. “On the Blau Monuments”&lt;/ref&gt; Most texts identify the right figure as a woman on the basis of Gelb’s identification, but if so, then ‘she’ lacks the characteristic dress present on other women from the same period, such as on the Ushumgal Stele. The reverse shows four men. Two are nude workers, kneeling with pestles and mortars. Between them stands a beardless, bald man wearing a net skirt. He holds his hands up like the smaller figure on the obverse. The remaining figure sits to the right, and appears nearly identical to the workers except slightly larger. This evidently depicts the process of food preparation for the feast.&lt;ref&gt;Gelb&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==
Like the Ushumgal Stele and other works from a similar time period, the text on the Blau Monuments is not fully comprehensible. Certain signs are readily identified, while others have no known identification. The obelisk’s inscription clearly refers to ‘5 bur’ of land, as well as a temple household and the profession “engar”. This title refers to a high official in an agricultural field, which would suggest the presence of an individual able to undertake such a transaction. The plaque’s text lists commodities of many sorts, as well as several other names and additional undeciphered information. The assumption, then, is that these items were exchanged for the land on the obelisk.

==Controversy==
As a result of the yet-undeciphered text and certain oddities in the iconography, any attempt at definitively declaring a purpose for the Monuments is naturally tenuous. The Monuments are two of only five “ancient kudurrus” listed by Gelb (a classification currently in dispute).&lt;ref&gt;Slanski, "The Babylonian Entitlement Narus"&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, they resist classification, and such a task is certainly not aided by the lack of definite information on their use.

'''Business action on climate change''' includes a range of activities relating to [[global warming]], and to influencing political decisions on global-warming-related [[regulation]], such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Major [[multinational corporation|multinational]]s have played and to some extent continue to play a significant role in the [[politics of global warming]], especially in the [[United States]], through [[lobbying]] of government and funding of [[global warming skeptic]]s. Business also plays a key role in the [[mitigation of global warming]], through decisions to invest in researching and implementing new [[energy technologies]] and energy efficiency measures.  (See also [[individual and political action on climate change]].)

==Overview==
In 1989 in the US, the [[petroleum]] and automotive industries and the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] created the [[Global Climate Coalition]] (GCC) to oppose mandatory actions to address global warming. In 1997, when the [[US Senate]] overwhelmingly passed a resolution against ratifying the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the industry funded a $13 million industry advertising blitz in the run-up to the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2005/05/snowed.html |title=Snowed |publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date= |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published&lt;ref name="NYT 1998"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/26/us/industrial-group-plans-to-battle-climate-treaty.html "Industrial Group Plans to Battle Climate Treaty"], ''The New York Times'', March 26, 1998.  Accessed 26 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; an [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) memo outlining a strategy aiming to make "recognition of uncertainty ... part of the 'conventional wisdom.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentaldefense.org/documents/3860_GlobalClimateSciencePlanMemo.pdf|title=Global Science Communications|date=April 3, 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715153809/http://www.edf.org/documents/3860_GlobalClimateSciencePlanMemo.pdf|archivedate=July 15, 2007|deadurl=yes}}.  Other sources for the file: https://web.archive.org/web/20070224102903/http://www.euronet.nl/users/e_wesker/ew@shell/API-prop.html https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/03/14/document_cw_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The memo has been compared to a late 1960s memo by tobacco company [[Brown and Williamson]], which observed: "Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy."&lt;ref name="motherjones2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2005/05/some_like_it_hot.html |title=Some Like It Hot |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those involved in the memo included Jeffrey Salmon, then executive director of the [[George C. Marshall Institute]], [[Steven Milloy]], a prominent skeptic commentator, and the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]]'s [[Myron Ebell]].&lt;ref name="motherjones2005"/&gt; In June 2005 a former API lawyer, [[Philip Cooney]], resigned his White House post after accusations of politically motivated tampering with scientific reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/oil/story/0,11319,1502486,00.html |title=Ex-oil lobbyist watered down US climate research &amp;#124; Environment |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-12-03 | location=London | first=Julian | last=Borger | date=2005-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the GCC considered its work in the US against [[Climate change policy of the United States|regulation on global warming]] to have been so successful that it "deactivated" itself,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalclimate.org/ Global Climate.org]&lt;/ref&gt; although the loss of some leading members may also have been a factor.

At the same time, since 1989 many previously skeptical petroleum and automobile industry corporations have changed their position as the political and scientific consensus has grown, with the creation of the Kyoto Protocol and the publication of the [[International Panel on Climate Change]]'s Second and [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]]s. These [[corporations]] include major petroleum companies like [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Texaco]], and [[BP]], as well as automobile manufacturers like [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], and [[DaimlerChrysler]]. Some of these have joined with the [[Center for Climate and Energy Solutions]] (formerly the Pew Center on Global Climate Change), a non-profit organization aiming to support efforts to address global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c2es.org/business/belc/members "Business Environmental Leadership Council (BELC) Member Companies"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221133900/http://www.c2es.org/business/belc/members |date=February 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, the [[Carbon Disclosure Project]] has been working with major corporations and investors to disclose the emissions of the largest companies. By 2007, the CDP published the emissions data for 2400 of the largest corporations in the world, and represented major institutional investors with $41 trillion combined assets under management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdproject.net/whatiscdp.asp "Carbon Disclosure Project: Homepage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012032734/http://www.cdproject.net/whatiscdp.asp |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pressure from these investors had had some success in working with companies to reduce emissions.

The [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]], a CEO-led association of some 200 multinational companies, has called on governments to agree on a global targets, and suggests that it is necessary to cut emissions by 60-80 percent from current levels by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WBCSD |url=http://www.wbcsd.org/Plugins/DocSearch/details.asp?DocTypeId=270&amp;ObjectId=MjYxODU |title=Climate Change Debate Needs Revolution, Financial Times, 5 September 2007 |publisher=Wbcsd.org |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2009-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211061703/http://www.wbcsd.org/Plugins/DocSearch/details.asp?DocTypeId=270&amp;ObjectId=MjYxODU |archivedate=11 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, after the [[Trump presidency|election of Donald Trump]], backing was shown in the business community for the [[Paris Agreement]], which became effective November 4, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/corporate-america-isnt-backing-trump-on-climate-2353777108.html |title=Corporate America isn't backing Trump on climate |author=Amy Harder |date=April 17, 2017 |website=AXIOS.com |publisher=[[AXIOS Media]] |access-date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Climate Coalition==

A central organization in climate skepticism was the [[Global Climate Coalition]] (1989–2002), a group of mainly [[United States]] businesses opposing immediate action to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The coalition funded skeptical scientists to be public spokespeople, provided industry a voice on climate change, and fought the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that "even as the coalition worked to sway opinion [towards skepticism], its own scientific and technical experts were advising that the science backing the role of greenhouse gases in global warming could not be refuted."&lt;ref&gt;Revkin, Andrew C. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/science/earth/24deny.html Industry Ignored Its Scientists on Climate], ''The New York Times''. April 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, the rate of corporate members leaving accelerated when they became the target of a national divestiture campaign run by John Passacantando and [[Phil Radford]] with the organization Ozone Action. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', when Ford Motor Company was the first company to leave the coalition, it was “the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming.”&lt;ref name="Canvassing Works"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Canvassing Works]] |url= http://www.canvassingworks.org/canvassingworks/2006/09/alumni_update_p.html |title= Canvassing Works |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/07/business/ford-announces-its-withdrawal-from-global-climate-coalition.html |title=Ford Announces Its Withdrawal From Global Climate Coalition |work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, between December 1999 and early March 2000, the GCC was deserted by Daimler-Chrysler, Texaco, the [[Southern Company]] and General Motors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=3440&amp;method=full|title= GCC Suffers Technical Knockout, Industry defections decimate Global Climate Coalition }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization closed in 2002, or in their own words, 'deactivated'.

==U.S. Climate Action Partnership==
The [[U.S. Climate Action Partnership]] (USCAP) was formed in January 2007 with the primary goal of influencing the US government's regulation of [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|greenhouse gas emissions]].  Original members included [[General Electric]], [[Alcoa]], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], etc., but they were joined in April, 2007 by [[ConocoPhilips]] and [[AIG]].

==Energy industry==

===ExxonMobil===
[[ExxonMobil]] has been a leading figure in the business world's position on climate change, providing substantial funding to a range of global-warming-skeptical organizations. ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' counted some 40 ExxonMobil-funded organization that "either have sought to undermine mainstream scientific findings on global climate change or have maintained affiliations with a small group of "skeptic" scientists who continue to do so." Between 2000 and 2003 these organizations received more than $8m in funding.&lt;ref name="motherjones2005"/&gt;

It has also had a key influence in the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s energy policy, including on the [[Kyoto Protocol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/climatechange/story/0,12374,1501646,00.html |title=Revealed: how oil giant influenced Bush &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-12-03 | location=London | date=2005-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by both $55m spent on [[lobbying]] since 1999,&lt;ref name="motherjones2005"/&gt;  and direct contacts between the company and leading politicians. It was a leading member of the Global Climate Coalition. It encouraged (and may have been instrumental in) the replacement in 2002 of the head of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], [[Robert Watson (scientist)|Robert Watson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exxonmobil.com/Europe-English/Citizen/Eu_VP_climate.asp|title=Climate Change – Addressing the Risks of Climate Change: ExxonMobil's Views and Actions |publisher=[[ExxonMobil]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218154822/http://www.exxonmobil.com/Europe-English/Citizen/Eu_VP_climate.asp|archivedate=December 18, 2007|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also invested $100m into the [[Global Climate and Energy Project]], with [[Stanford University]], and other programs at institutions such as the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the [[International Energy Agency]] [[IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme|Greenhouse Gas Research and Development Program]].

Some of Exxon's activities on climate change produced strong criticism from environmental groups, including reactions such as a leaflet produced by the [[Stop Esso campaign]], saying 'Don't buy E$$o', and featuring a tiger hand setting fire to the Earth. The company's carbon dioxide emissions are more than 50% higher than those of British rival BP, despite the US firm's oil and gas production being only slightly larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,1321223,00.html |title=Exxon admits greenhouse gas increase &amp;#124; Environment |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-12-03 | location=London | first=Terry | last=MacAlister | date=2004-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2004 study commissioned by [[Friends of the Earth]], [[ExxonMobil]] and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/exxonmobils_contribution_t_28012004.html |title=Friends of the Earth: Archived press release: Exxonmobil's contribution to global warming revealed |publisher=[[Friends of the Earth (EWNI)]] foe.co.uk |date=2004-01-29 |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BP===
BP left the Global Climate Coalition in 1997 and said that global warming was a problem that had to be dealt with, although it subsequently joined others in lobbying the Australian government not to sign the Kyoto Protocol unless the US did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/sbeder/Reputation.html |title=Environmentalists and corporate reputation management |publisher=Uow.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2002 [[BP]]'s [[chief executive]], [[John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley|Lord Browne]], declared in a speech that [[global warming]] was real and that urgent action was needed, saying that "Companies composed of highly skilled and trained people can't live in denial of mounting evidence gathered by hundreds of the most reputable scientists in the world.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=mindfully.org |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/BP-How-Green8dec02.htm |title=How Green Is BP? DARCY FREY / The New York Times 8dec02 |publisher=Mindfully.org |date=2001-02-13 |accessdate=2009-12-03 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100620070445/http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/BP-How-Green8dec02.htm# |archive-date=2010-06-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 BP was considering testing [[carbon sequestration]] in one of its [[North Sea]] oil fields, by pumping [[carbon dioxide]] into them (and thereby also increasing yields).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1469010,00.html |title=Seabed supplies a cure for global warming crisis &amp;#124; Science &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |accessdate=2009-12-03 | location=London | first=Robin | last=McKie | date=2005-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout 2006 BP, led by their CEO Lord John Browne, has continued to take a leadership stance on climate change. It has cut its own operational emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by 10%. It is investing $8 billion in renewable energy over the next 10 years. And most recently it has launched a 'target zero' campaign in the UK to encourage its customers to offset their vehicle emissions when they fill up at the petrol station.

BP's American division is a member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) (see above).

===Koch Industries===

From 2005 to 2008, [[Koch Industries]] donated $5.7 million on political campaigns and $37 million on direct lobbying to support fossil fuel industries. Between 1997 and 2008, Koch Industries donated a total of nearly $48 million to climate opposition groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/30/us-oil-donated-millions-climate-sceptics | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=US oil company donated millions to climate sceptic groups, says Greenpeace | first=John | last=Vidal | date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Greenpeace]], Koch Industries is the major source of funds of what Greenpeace calls "[[Climate change denial|climate denial]]".&lt;ref name="GP1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/campaigns/global-warming-and-energy/polluterwatch/koch-industries |title=Secretly Funding the Climate Denial Machine |date=2010-03-29 |work=Global Warming |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |accessdate=2010-04-01 |location=Washington |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401050808/http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/campaigns/global-warming-and-energy/polluterwatch/koch-industries |archivedate=April 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brendan-demelle/greenpeace-unmasks-koch-i_b_518036.html |title=Greenpeace Unmasks Koch Industries' Funding of Climate Denial Industry |last=DeMelle|first=Brendan |date=2010-03-30 |publisher=Huffington Post |location=Los Angeles }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koch Industries and its subsidiaries spent more than $20 million on lobbying in 2008 and $12.3 million in 2009, according to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], a nonpartisan research group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?year=2008&amp;lname=Koch+Industries&amp;id=|title=Client Profile: Summary, 2008|publisher=Center For Responsive Politics|work=www.opensecrets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?year=2009&amp;lname=Koch+Industries&amp;id=|title=Client Profile: Summary, 2009|publisher=Center For Responsive Politics|work=www.opensecrets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
[[American Electric Power]], the world's largest private producer of carbon dioxide, said in 2005 that targets for carbon reduction "represent a common-sense approach that can begin the process of lowering emissions along a gradual, cost-effective path." The company complained that "uncertainties over the cost of carbon" made it very difficult to make decisions about capital investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/featurex/2005/05/globalinc.html |title=Global Inc. Goes Green |publisher=Mother Jones |date=2007-08-10 |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DuPont]] has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 65% since 1990, saving hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. "Give us a date, tell us how much we need to cut, give us the flexibility to meet the goals, and we'll get it done", [[Xcel Energy]] [[CEO]] Wayne Brunetti told ''[[Business Week]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_33/b3896001_mz001.htm |title=BW Online &amp;#124; August 16, 2004 &amp;#124; Global Warming |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2004-08-16 |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Duke Energy]], [[FPL Group]], and [[PG&amp;E Corporation]] are members of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) (see above).

==Transportation==
A large proportion of carbon dioxide emissions occur because of transportation. Several companies have formed or invested in electric substitutes for standard automobiles.  The [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]] is an all-electric sports car, and [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] also produces the [[Tesla Model S]] sedan.  [[Vectrix]] produces and sells an electric scooter rated for 100&amp;nbsp;km/h (60&amp;nbsp;mph).

There has also been greatly increased interest in [[personal rapid transit]], which applies system engineering principles to reduce energy use, eliminate traffic jams, and produce an acceptable substitute to replace cars, all at the same time.  Most systems fully meet Kyoto Treaty carbon emission goals now, 60 years ahead of schedule.  Korean steel maker [[POSCO]] and its partner Vectus Ltd. have produced a working safety case, including test track and vehicles, that remains fully functional in Swedish winters.  Vectus and Suncheon S. Korea signed a memorandum of understanding to install a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vectusprt.com/center/news_view.php |title=POSCO signs MOU with Suncheon City Government for Asia's first Personal Rapid Transit System |publisher=Vectusprt.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Advanced Transportation Systems' [[ULTra]] passed safety certification by the UK Rail Inspectorate in 2003, and won a demonstration project at Heathrow Airport due to be in service in early 2010. ATS Ltd. estimates its ULTra PRT will consume 839 BTU per passenger mile (0.55 [[megajoule|MJ]] per passenger km).&lt;ref name="Lowson"&gt;{{cite web

==Insurance industry==
Climate change threatens to reduce the insurance industry's profits and to slow its growth into developing countries. This has led some to argue that the insurance industry is the natural business to lead a response to climate change&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Insurance companies should collect a carbon levy |journal=Nature |volume=549 |issue=7671 |pages=152-154 |first1=Anthony J. |last1=Webster |last2=Clarke |first2=Richard H. |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/549152a }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2004 [[Swiss Re]], the world's second largest [[reinsurance]] company, warned that the economic costs of climate-related disasters threatened to reach $150 billion a year within ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2005/09/911_in_new_orleans.html |title=911 in New Orleans |publisher=Mother Jones |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Lloyd's of London]], published a report highlighting the latest science and implications for the insurance industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lloyds.com/NR/rdonlyres/38782611-5ED3-4FDC-85A4-5DEAA88A2DA0/0/FINAL360climatechangereport.pdf "Climate Change - Adapt or Bust"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss Re, has said that if the shore communities of four Gulf Coast states choose not to implement adaptation strategies, they could see annual climate-change related damages jump 65 percent a year to $23 billion by 2030. "Society needs to reduce its vulnerability to climate risks, and as long as they remain manageable, they remain insurable, which is our interest as well," said Mark D. Way, head of Swiss Re's [[sustainable development]] for [[the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissre.com/media/news_releases/US_Gulf_Coast_could_face_average_annual_losses_of_up_to_USD_23_billion_by_2030_and_cumulative_economic_damages_of_USD_350_billion_from_climate_risks_says_Swiss_Re_research.html US Gulf Coast could face average annual losses of up to US$23 billion by 2030 and cumulative economic damages of $350 billion from climate risks, says Swiss Re research]; 20 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/science/earth/23adaptation.html A City Prepares for a Warm Long-Term Forecast] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
{{Main|Media coverage of climate change}}

In the UK, some newspapers (''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'') are significantly skeptical, while most others (with varying enthusiasm, ''[[The Independent]]'' giving it most prominence) support action on global warming. Overall, British newspapers have given the issue three times more coverage than US newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2005/05/snowed.html | title=Snowed | publisher=Mother Jones | author=Ross Gelbspan | date=May 2005 | accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 (''[[British Sky Broadcasting]]'' (Sky) became the world's first media company to go 'climate neutral' by purchasing enough carbon offsets. The CEO of the company [[James Murdoch]] (son of [[Rupert Murdoch]] and heir apparent for the News International empire) is a strong advocate of action on climate change and is thought to be influential on the issue within the wider group of companies, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' announced it was "going green" and now covers the global warming issue extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/section/0,,2006410004,00.html | title=Go Green | work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] | accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, to much industry interest, Rupert Murdoch invited [[Al Gore]] to make his climate change presentation at the annual News Corp (including the Fox Network) gathering at the Pebble Beach golf resort, (USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/de691d8a-552e-11db-acba-0000779e2340.html | publisher=[[Financial Times]] | title=Gore and Murdoch join forces in TV deal | author=Emiko Terazono | date=6 October 2006 | accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, Rupert Murdoch announced plans for News Corp. to be [[carbon neutral]] by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/08/14/news/companies/pluggedin_gunther_murdoch.fortune/ |publisher=CNN |title=Rupert Murdoch's climate crusade |author=Marc Gunther |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725222516/http://money.cnn.com/2007/08/14/news/companies/pluggedin_gunther_murdoch.fortune/ |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==More on business action==
Businesses take action on climate change for several reasons. Action improves corporate image and better aligns corporate actions with the environmental interests of owners, employees, suppliers, and customers.  Action also occurs to reduce costs, increase return on investments, and to reduce dependency on uncontrollable costs.

===Increased energy efficiency===
For many companies, looking at more [[efficient energy use]] can pay off in the medium to long term; unfortunately, shareholders need to be satisfied in the short term, so regulatory intervention is often required, to encourage prudent conservation measures. However, as [[carbon intensity]] starts to show up on balance books through organizations such as the [[Carbon Disclosure Project]], voluntary action is starting to take place.

Recently there has been a spate of companies acting to improve their energy efficiency. Possibly the most prominent of these companies is [[Wal-Mart]]. Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the US, has announced specific environmental goals to reduce energy use in its stores and pressure its 60,000 suppliers in its worldwide supply chain to follow its lead. On energy efficiency, Wal-Mart wants to increase the fuel efficiency of its truck fleet by 25% over the next three years and double it within ten years, moving from 6.5 mpg. This seems an attainable goal, and by 2020, it is expected to save the company $494 million a year. The company also wants to build a store that is at least 25% more energy efficient within four years.

===Use of renewable energies===
{{Main|Renewable energy commercialization}}
In August 2002, the largest gathering of ministers in the history of the world met at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.ca/wssd/portal.html |title=WSSD |website=www.iisd.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113005414/http://www.iisd.ca/wssd/portal.html |archivedate=2006-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The global environmental community discussed the role of renewables and energy efficiency in lowering carbon emissions, mitigating poverty reduction (energy access) and improving energy security.  One result from WSSD was the formation of to carry forward the international dialogue on sustainable energy and its role in the energy mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/partnerships/partnerships.htm |title=Partnerships for Sustainable Development |website=www.un.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partnerships formed include the [[Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership]], the Global Village Energy Partnership, the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition (JREC), and the Global Network on Energy for Sustainable Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP)|url=http://www.reeep.org/|website=Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP)|accessdate=April 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvep.org |title=GVEP |website=www.gvep.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107131951/http://www.gvep.org/ |archivedate=2006-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home - Global Network on Energy for Sustainable Development|url=http://www.gnesd.org|website=www.gnesd.org|accessdate=April 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energies and renewable energy technologies have many advantages over their fossil fuel counterparts. These advantages include the absence of local pollution such as particulates, sulphur oxides (SOX's) and nitrous oxides (NOX's). For the business community, the economic advantages are also becoming clearer. Numerous studies have shown that the working environment has a significant effect on workforce morale. Renewable energy solutions are a part of this, wind turbines in particular being seen by many as a potent symbol of a new modernity, where environmental considerations are taken seriously. A workforce seeing a forward-looking and responsible company is more likely to feel good about working for such a company. A happier workforce is a more productive workforce.

More directly, the high petroleum (oil) and gas prices of 2005 have only added to the attraction of renewable energy sources. Although most renewable energies are more expensive at current fuel prices, the difference is narrowing, and uncertainty in oil and gas markets is a factor worth considering for highly energy-intensive businesses.

Another factor affecting the uptake of renewable energies in Europe is the EU Energy Trading Scheme (ETS or EUTS). Many large businesses are fined for increases in emissions, but can sell any "excess" reductions they make.

Companies with high-profile renewable energy portfolios include an aluminium smelter ([[Alcan]]), a cement company ([[Lafarge Tarmac|Lafarge]]), and a microchip manufacturer ([[Intel]]). Many examples of corporate leadership in this area can be found on the website of [[Climate Group|The Climate Group]], an independent organization set up for promoting such action by business and government.

===Carbon offsets===
The principle of [[carbon offset]] is fairly simple: a business decides that it doesn't want to contribute further to global warming, and it has already made efforts to reduce its carbon (dioxide) emissions, so it decides to pay someone else to further reduce its net emissions by planting trees or by taking up low-carbon technologies. Every unit of carbon that is absorbed by trees—or not emitted due to funding of renewable energy deployment—offsets the emissions from fossil fuel use. In many cases, funding of renewable energy, energy efficiency, or tree planting—particularly in developing nations—can be a relatively cheap way of making an event, project, or business "carbon neutral".  Many carbon offset providers—some as inexpensive as $0.10 per ton of carbon dioxide—are referenced in the [[carbon offset|Carbon Offset]] article of this encyclopedia.

Many businesses are now looking to carbon offset all their work. An example of a business going carbon neutral is [[FIFA]]: their 2006 World Cup Final will be carbon neutral. FIFA estimate they are offsetting one hundred thousand tons of carbon dioxide created by the event, largely as a result of people travelling there. Other carbon neutral companies include the bank [[HSBC]], the consumer staples manufacturer [[Annie's Homegrown]], world leading society publisher [[Blackwell Publishing]], and the publishing house [[New Society Publishers]].  [[The Guardian]] newspaper also offsets its carbon emissions resulting from international air travel.&lt;!-- BULLETS FOR EXPANSION

'''Forecasting''' is a method of controlling building [[heating]] by calculating demand for heating energy that should be supplied to the building in each time unit. By combining physics of structures with meteorology, properties of the building, weather conditions including outdoor temperature, wind power and direction, as well as solar radiation can be taken into account. In the case of conventional heating control, only current outdoor temperature is considered.

The starting point for developing the method of forecasting was the ENLOSS mathematical energy balance model developed by Prof. Roger Taesler
&lt;ref&gt;Taesler, R. (1990/91) "Climate and Building Energy Management". ''Energy and Buildings'', Vol. 15-16, pp 599 - 608.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] in cooperation with Thorbjörn Geiser and Stefan Berglund,&lt;ref&gt;United States Patent 6098893 "Comfort control system incorporating weather forecast data and a method for operating such a system" (Inventor Stefan Berglund)&lt;/ref&gt; who are currently both employed at eGain Sweden AB. Forecasting method began to be introduced to use in the late 1980s.

Until 2010 inclusive, forecasting method has been introduced in nearly seven million square metres of floorage of residential buildings and commercial premises. Forecasting method is offered and developed by many companies and organizations. Estimated data indicate 10 - 15 kWh/m2  reduction of average annual heat energy consumption. Since forecasting method contains information about future demand and is not in conflict with other methods of increasing energy efficiency, it is always a good foreground solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sasic Kaligasidis, A et al. (2006) "Upgraded weather forecast control of building [[heating systems]]". p. 951 ff in ''Research in Building Physics and Building Engineering'' Paul Fazio (Editorial Staff), {{ISBN|0-415-41675-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forecasting in practice==
As far as practical use of forecasting method is concerned, usually remote control forecasting receivers are used to send and receive data by means of [[GPRS]] or [[GSM]] network. Then, the forecasting receivers manage the operation of control panels installed in buildings which adjust distribution of [[heat]] energy in the [[heating system]] of a given property.

Recently, special remote control weather loggers have started to be used in combination with forecasting receivers. The weather loggers measure air [[temperature]] and [[humidity]] with high accuracy and the measurements are sent in real time to forecasting receivers to which they are connected. Such a turning point in technology indicates even higher precision of forecasting method.

[[Image:Mixed nuts small white2.jpg|right|thumb|Brazil nuts ride on top of other assorted nuts]]

'''Granular convection''', or '''granular segregation''', is a phenomenon where [[granular material]] subjected to shaking or vibration will exhibit circulation patterns similar to types of fluid [[convection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jfi.uchicago.edu/~jaeger/granular2/convection.html Granular Convection and Size Separation]. The University of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes described as the '''Brazil nut effect''' when the largest particles end up on the surface of a granular material containing a mixture of variously sized objects; this derives from the example of a typical container of mixed nuts, where the largest will be [[Brazil nut]]s. The phenomenon is also known as the '''muesli effect''' since it is seen in packets of [[breakfast cereal]] containing particles of different [[volume|sizes]] but similar [[density]], such as [[muesli]] mix.

Under experimental conditions, granular convection of variously sized particles has been observed forming [[convection cells]] similar to fluid motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.078002|title=On the brink of jamming: Granular convection in densely filled containers|year=2008|last1=Rietz|first1=Frank|last2=Stannarius|first2=Ralf|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=100|issue=7|bibcode = 2008PhRvL.100g8002R|pmid=18352597|page=078002|arxiv=1706.04978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/10/bead-cloud-mystery/#ixzz0xbmvgKP1 Baffling Patterns Form in Scientific Sandbox], Wired, Brandon Keim, October 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The convection of granular flows is becoming a well-understood phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/06/sandgrains/#ixzz0xboW3KAI Grains of Sand Reveal Possible Fifth State of Matter], Wired, Brandon Keim, June 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[Image:Paranuss-Effekt_Brazil_Nut_Effect_Granular_Convection.webm|right|thumb|Brazil nut effect]]It may be [[counterintuitive]] to find that the largest and (presumably) heaviest particles rise to the top, but several explanations are possible:
* The center of mass of the whole system (containing the mixed nuts) in an arbitrary state is not optimally low; it has the tendency to be higher due to there being more empty space around the larger Brazil nuts than around smaller nuts.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} When the nuts are shaken, the system has the tendency to move to a lower energy state, which means moving the center of mass down by moving the smaller nuts down and thereby the Brazil nuts up.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* Including the effects of [[air]] in spaces between particles, larger particles may become [[buoyancy|buoyant]] or sink.  Smaller particles can fall into the spaces underneath a larger particle after each shake.  Over time, the larger particle rises in the mixture. (According to [[Heinrich Jaeger]], "[this] explanation for size separation might work in situations in which there is no granular convection, for example for containers with completely frictionless side walls or deep below the surface of tall containers (where convection is strongly suppressed). On the other hand, when friction with the side walls or other mechanisms set up a convection roll pattern inside the vibrated container, we found that the convective motion immediately takes over as the dominant mechanism for size separation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/safarchive/3_ask/archive/qna/3294_sand.html |title=Sidney Nagel and Heinrich Jaeger Q&amp;A |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* The same explanation without buoyancy or center of mass arguments:  As a larger particle moves upward, any motion of smaller particles into the spaces underneath blocks the larger particle from settling back in its previous position.  Repetitive motion results in more smaller particles slipping beneath larger particles.  A greater density of the larger particles has no effect on this process.  Shaking is not necessary; any process which raises particles and then lets them settle would have this effect.  The process of raising the particles imparts potential energy into the system.  The result of all the particles settling in a different order may be an increase in the potential energy—a raising of the center of mass.
* When shaken, the particles move in vibration-induced [[convection]] flow; individual particles move up through the middle, across the surface, and down the sides. If a large particle is involved, it will be moved up to the top by convection flow. Once at the top, the large particle will stay there because the convection currents are too narrow to sweep it down along the wall.

The phenomenon is related to [[Parrondo's paradox#The saw-tooth example|Parrondo's paradox]] in as much as the Brazil nuts move to the top of the mixed nuts against the gravitational gradient when subjected to random shaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott | first=Derek | authorlink=Derek Abbott |title=Applications of Nonlinear Dynamics |publisher=Springer |year=2009 |pages=307–321 |chapter=Developments in Parrondo's Paradox |isbn=978-3-540-85631-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Granular convection has been probed by the use of [[MRI]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Granular Convection Observed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging |doi=10.1126/science.267.5204.1632|year=1995|last1=Ehrichs|first1=E. E.|last2=Jaeger|first2=H. M.|last3=Karczmar|first3=G. S.|last4=Knight|first4=J. B.|last5=Kuperman|first5=V. Yu.|last6=Nagel|first6=S. R.|journal=Science|volume=267|issue=5204|pages=1632–4|pmid=17808181|bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1632E }}&lt;/ref&gt; where convection rolls similar to those in fluids ([[Bénard cell]]s) can be visualized.

==Applications==

===Manufacturing===
The effect is of serious interest for some manufacturing operations; once a homogeneous mixture of granular materials has been produced, it is usually undesirable for the different particle types to segregate.  Several factors determine the severity of the Brazil nut effect, including the sizes and [[density|densities]] of the particles, the [[pressure]] of any [[gas]] between the particles, and the shape of the container. A rectangular box (such as a box of breakfast cereal) or [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] (such as a can of nuts) works well to favour the effect,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} while a [[cone (geometry)|cone]]-shaped {{Clarify|date=July 2012}} container results in what is known as the '''reverse Brazil nut effect'''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Astronomy===
In [[astronomy]], it is also seen in some low density, or [[rubble pile]] [[asteroid]]s, for example the asteroid [[25143 Itokawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=22 April 2007 |title=Smooth Sections of Asteroid Itokawa |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
In [[geology]], the effect is common in formerly glaciated areas such as [[New England]] and areas in regions of [[permafrost]] where the landscape is shaped into [[hummocks]] by [[frost heave]] — new stones appear in the fields every year from deeper underground. [[Horace Greeley]] noted "Picking stones is a never-ending labor on one of those New England farms. Pick as closely as you may, the next plowing turns up a fresh eruption of boulders and pebbles, from the size of a hickory nut to that of a tea-kettle." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osv.org/school/lesson_plans/ShowLessons.php?PageID=P&amp;LessonID=34&amp;DocID=96 excerpt from ''Recollections of a Busy Life''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910004003/http://www.osv.org/school/lesson_plans/ShowLessons.php?PageID=P&amp;LessonID=34&amp;DocID=96 |date=2012-09-10 }}, by Horace Greeley 1869&lt;/ref&gt;  A hint to the cause appears in his further description that "this work is mainly to be done in March or April, when the earth is saturated with ice-cold water". Underground water freezes, lifting all particles above it.  As the water starts to melt, smaller particles can settle into the opening spaces while larger particles are still raised.  By the time ice no longer supports the larger rocks, they are at least partially supported by the smaller particles that slipped below them.  Repeated freeze-thaw cycles in a single year speeds up the process.

This phenomenon is one of the causes of [[Graded bedding|inverse grading]] which can be observed in many situations including [[soil liquefaction]] during [[earthquake]]s or [[Mass wasting#Flows|mudslides]].  Granular convection is also exemplified by [[debris flow]], which is a fast moving, liquefied landslide of unconsolidated, saturated debris that looks like flowing concrete. These flows can carry material ranging in size from clay to boulders, including woody debris such as logs and tree stumps. Flows can be triggered by intense rainfall, glacial melt, or a combination of the two.

The '''Great Western main line''' is a [[main line (railway)|main line]] [[railway]] in England, that runs westwards from [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]] to {{stnlnk|Bristol Temple Meads}}. Opened in 1841, it was the original route of the pre-1948 [[Great Western Railway]] which was merged into the [[Western Region of British Railways]] and is now a part of the national rail system managed by [[Network Rail]].

[[21st-century modernisation of the Great Western main line|The line is currently being electrified]]. It was electrified from [[Paddington station|Paddington]] to [[Heathrow Terminal 4 railway station|Heathrow Airport]] in the late 1990s. Work to electrify the remainder of the route started in 2011 with an initial aim to complete the work all the way to Bristol by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modernising the Great Western|url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/uploadedFiles/networkrailcouk/Contents/Improvements/The_Great_Western/WesternVision.pdf|last=Network Rail|accessdate=24 August 2016|date=June 2011|ref=harv|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413065743/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/uploadedFiles/networkrailcouk/Contents/Improvements/The_Great_Western/WesternVision.pdf|archivedate=13 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme however has been deferred with no end completion forecast because costs have tripled. The four sections deferred are: [[Didcot Parkway railway station|Didcot Parkway]] to [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]], [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] to [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]], [[Royal Wootton Bassett]] Junction to Bristol Temple Meads and the Thames Valley branches to [[Henley railway station|Henley]] and [[Windsor &amp; Eton Riverside railway station|Windsor]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/21/cost-to-electrify-great-western-mainline-triples-to-28bn-risking-other-schemes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/infrastructure/single-view/view/great-western-electrification-projects-deferred.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Great Western Railway}}
The line was built by the [[Great Western Railway]] and engineered by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] as a dual track line using a wider {{track gauge|84in|lk=on}} [[broad gauge]] and was opened in stages between 1838 and 1841. The final section, between Chippenham and Bath, was opened on completion of the [[Box Tunnel]] in June 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/wilts/vol4/pp280-293|title=Victoria County History: Wiltshire: Vol 4: Railways|year=1959|editor-last=Crittall|editor-first=Elizabeth|website=British History Online|publisher=University of London|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alignment was so level and straight it was nicknamed "Brunel's billiard table". It was supplemented with a third rail for [[dual gauge]] operation, allowing standard gauge {{track gauge|uksg}} trains to also operate on the route, in stages between 1854 and 1875. Dual gauge was introduced as follows: London to [[Reading railway station|Reading]] (October 1861), Reading to {{rws|Didcot}} (December 1856), Didcot to {{rws|Swindon}} (February 1872), Swindon to Thingley Junction, {{rws|Chippenham}} (June 1874), Thingley Junction to {{rws|Bathampton}} (March 1875), Bathampton to Bristol (June 1874), Bristol station area (May 1854). The broad gauge remained in use until 1892. Evidence of the original broad gauge can still be seen at many places where bridges are a wider than usual, or where tracks are ten feet apart instead of the usual six.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The original dual tracks were widened to four in places, mainly in the east half, between 1877 and 1899: Paddington to {{rws|Southall}} (October 1877), Southall to {{rws|West Drayton}} (November 1878), West Drayton to {{rws|Slough}} (June 1879), Slough to east side of [[Maidenhead Railway Bridge|Maidenhead Bridge]] (September 1884), Maidenhead Bridge to {{rws|Reading}} (June 1893), Reading station (1899), Reading to {{rws|Pangbourne}} (July 1893), Pangbourne to [[Cholsey railway station|Cholsey and Moulsford]] (?), Cholsey and Moulsford to [[Didcot Parkway railway station|Didcot]] (December 1892); also short sections between Didcot and Swindon, and at Bristol.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Following the [[Slough rail accident]] in 1900 when five passengers were killed, improved [[vacuum brake|vacuum braking]] systems were used on locomotives and passenger rolling stock and [[GWR ATC|Automatic Train Control]] (ATC) was introduced in 1908.

Further widenings of the line took place between 1903 and 1910 and more widening work took place between 1931 and 1932.{{sfn|Sanderson | Pollard | Thorne | Hradsky |2012| page = 6 }}

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the Great Western Railway was taken into government control, as were most major railways in Britain and were reorganised after the war into the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|"big four" companies]], of which the Great Western Railway was one. The railways returned to direct government control during [[World War II]] before being nationalised to form [[British Rail]]ways (BR) in 1948.{{Relevance inline|date=August 2016}}

The line speed was upgraded in the 1970s to support the introduction of the [[InterCity 125]] (HST).&lt;ref name='EarlyHighspeedBR'&gt;{{cite web |title= High speed track on the Western Region of British Railways |last=Collins |first=R.J. |url= http://www.atypon-link.com/ITELF/doi/pdf/10.1680/iicep.1978.2755 |publisher= [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] |accessdate= 18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the Parliamentary Select Committee on Nationalised Industries recommended considering electrification of more of Britain's rail network, and by 1979 BR presented a range of options that included electrifying the line from Paddington to Swansea by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anonymous |title= Railway Electrification |date=Winter 1979 |location= |publisher= [[British Railways Board]] (Central Publicity Unit) |pages=0–2, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|1979–90 Conservative governments]] that succeeded the [[Callaghan ministry|1976–79 Labour government]], the proposal was not implemented.

In August 2008 it was announced that a number of speed limits on the relief lines between Reading and London had been raised, so that 86% of the line could be used at {{Convert|90|mph}}.&lt;ref name="First Great Western Customer Panel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/Documents/Custom/Customer%20panel/East%20Customer%20Panel%209.10.08%20minutes%20-%20WEBSITE.pdf |title=First Great Western Customer Panel |accessdate=24 November 2008 |publisher=[[First Great Western]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heritage===
The route of the GWML includes dozens of [[listed building]]s and structures, including tunnel portals, bridges and viaducts, stations, and associated hotels.{{sfn|Sanderson | Pollard | Thorne | Hradsky |2012}} Part of the route passes through and contributes to the [[Georgian Architecture]] of the [[City of Bath]] World Heritage Site; the path through [[Sydney Gardens]] has been described as a ''"piece of deliberate railway theatre by Brunel without parallel"''.{{sfn|Sanderson | Pollard | Thorne | Hradsky |2012|loc =   MLN1 10605, MLN1 10605, MLN1 10605, MLN1 10610, MLN1 10614, MLN1 10618}} [[Grade I]] listed structures on the line include [[London Paddington]], [[Wharncliffe Viaduct]], the 1839 Tudor gothic [[Avon Bridge|River Avon Bridge]] in Bristol, and [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads station]].{{sfn|Sanderson | Pollard | Thorne | Hradsky |2012| loc =  MLN1 0000 , MLN1 0742, MLN1 11725, MLN1 11826 }}

==Route==
The communities served by the Great Western main line include: [[London|West London]] (including [[Acton, London|Acton]], [[Ealing]], [[Hanwell]], [[Southall]], [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]], [[Harlington, London|Harlington]] and [[West Drayton]]); [[Iver]]; [[Langley, Slough|Langley]]; [[Slough]]; [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]]; [[Taplow]]; [[Maidenhead]]; [[Twyford, Berkshire|Twyford]]; [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]; [[Tilehurst]]; [[Pangbourne]]; [[Goring-on-Thames]]; [[Streatley, Berkshire|Streatley]]; [[Cholsey]]; [[Didcot]]; [[Swindon]]; [[Chippenham]]; [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]; [[Keynsham]]; and [[Bristol]].

From London to Didcot, the line follows the [[Thames Valley]], crossing the [[River Thames]] three times, including on the famous [[Maidenhead Railway Bridge]]. After [[Swindon railway station|Swindon]], trains pass the [[Swindon Steam Railway Museum]]. From Wootton Bassett there are two different routes to Bristol, firstly via [[Box Tunnel]] and secondly via {{Stnlnk|Bristol Parkway}}.

It is also possible to run via the [[Wessex Main Line]], but this involves a reversal at Bradford Junction, so is only really suitable for multiple unit trains or via Reading to Bath via Newbury. Trains on the Great Western main line are sometimes diverted from Reading along the [[Reading to Taunton line]], as far as {{Stnlnk|Westbury}}, from where they can use the [[Wessex Main Line]] to reach either Chippenham, or Bath Spa. Beyond Bristol, some trains continue on the [[Bristol to Taunton Line]] to {{Stnlnk|Weston-super-Mare}} or beyond.

The following routes are managed by [[Network Rail]] as part of the Great Western main line (Route 13):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/BusinessPlan2007/PDF/Route%2013%20Great%20Western%20Main%20Line.pdf |title=2007 Business Plan |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Didcot to {{Stnlnk|Oxford}} and [[Worcester Foregate Street railway station|Worcester]] via the [[Cherwell Valley Line]] and [[Cotswold Line]], Swindon to {{Stnlnk|Cheltenham Spa}} via the [[Golden Valley Line]], Swindon to {{Stnlnk|Cardiff Central}} and {{Stnlnk|Swansea}} via the [[South Wales Main Line]], [[Cross Country Route]]s south of [[Birmingham]] and also all connecting branch lines.

==Services==
Main line and local services are provided by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] (GWR). The stations served by trains between London Paddington and Bristol Temple Meads are: {{Stnlnk|Slough}}, {{Stnlnk|Reading}}, {{Stnlnk|Didcot Parkway}}, {{Stnlnk|Swindon}}, {{Stnlnk|Chippenham}}, and {{Stnlnk|Bath Spa}}. Some trains between London and Bristol do not call at Didcot Parkway and very few stop at Slough.

Fast trains from Paddington to [[London Heathrow Airport]] are operated by [[Heathrow Airport Holdings]] as the [[Heathrow Express]]. Local services on this route were previously jointly operated by GWR and BAA under the [[Heathrow Connect]] name.

[[CrossCountry]] operate trains between Reading and Oxford, using the Great Western main line as far as Didcot and [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway]] operate a limited number of trains between Bath and Bristol.

Great Western Railway also operate a train between London Paddington – Cardiff Central every 30 minutes, with hourly extensions to [[Swansea railway station|Swansea]]. At Swansea/Cardiff there is a connecting [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]] boat train to/from [[Fishguard Harbour railway station|Fishguard Harbour]] for the [[Stena Line]] ferry to [[Rosslare Europort]] in [[Ireland]]. An integrated timetable is offered between [[London Paddington]] and [[Rosslare Europort]] with through ticketing available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stenaline.ie/ferry/rail-and-sail/fishguard/ |title=Sail and Rail to Britain &amp;#124; Train and Ferry Travel to England &amp; Wales &amp;#124; Stena Line |publisher=Stenaline.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Daytime and nocturnal journeys are offered in both directions daily (including Sundays). Additionally, 2–3 Great Western Railway trains continue to [[Pembroke Dock railway station|Pembroke Dock]] on weekends during the Summer season to connect with ferry services to Ireland.

==Infrastructure==
[[File:St James Railway Bridge, Bath.jpg|thumb|right|St James Railway Bridge, Bath]]
Between London and Didcot there are four tracks, two for each direction. The main lines are mostly used by the faster trains and are on the south side of the route. The relief lines on the north side are used for slower services and those that call at all stations, as only London Paddington, Slough, Maidenhead, Twyford, Reading and [[Didcot Parkway railway station|Didcot Parkway]] stations have platforms on the main lines (although a few others have main line platforms that can be used in an emergency). Between Didcot and [[Royal Wootton Bassett]], a series of passing loops allow fast trains to overtake slower ones. This section is signalled for bi-directional running on each line but this facility is usually only used during engineering working or when there is significant disruption to traffic in one direction.&lt;ref name=2007plans/&gt;

The summit of the line is at Swindon, and falls away in each direction: Swindon is {{convert|270|ft|m}} above Paddington, and {{convert|292|ft|m}} above Bristol Temple Meads. The maximum [[grade (slope)|gradient]] between Paddington and Didcot is 1 in 1320 (0.75 [[&amp;permil;]] or 0.075 [[Percent sign|%]]); between Didcot and Swindon it is 1 in 660 (1.5 &amp;permil; or 0.15 %) but west of Swindon, gradients as steep as 1 in 100 (10 &amp;permil; or 1 %) are found in places, such as [[Box Tunnel]] and to the east of {{stnlnk|Dauntsey}}.{{sfn|MacDermot|1927|pp=124, 127}}{{sfn|Gradient Profiles|2003|loc=figs. W1, W6}}

The line is electrified between Paddington and Didcot Parkway using [[25 kV AC]] overhead supply lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Trains On The Way as Thames Valley Electrification Reaches Major Milestone|url=http://www.crossrail.co.uk/news/articles/new-trains-on-the-way-as-thames-valley-electrification-reaches-major-milestone|publisher=Crossrail Ltd|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line speed is {{Convert|125|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Great Western Main Line|url=http://www.agilitytrains.com/great-western-main-line|publisher=Agility Trains|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relief lines from Paddington to Didcot are limited to {{Convert|90|mph|km/h}} as far as Reading, and then {{Convert|100|mph|km/h}} to Didcot.

==Planned developments==
{{Main|21st-century modernisation of the Great Western main line }}
Since 2011, the Great Western has been undergoing a £5 billion modernisation by Network Rail.{{sfn|Network Rail|2011|p=8}}

[[Reading railway station]] saw a major redevelopment with new platforms, a new entrance, footbridge and lifts; the work was completed a year ahead of schedule&lt;ref name=bbc_9July2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading rail station revamp 'a year ahead of schedule'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-18769442|website=www.bbc.com|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=£425M transformation planned at Reading|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/general/2008/09/10-reading-station-boost.html|work=railnews.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-28334188 Queen opens revamped Reading station] ''BBC News'' 17 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrification from Airport Junction to the west===
The [[Crossrail]] project covered electrification of the line from Airport Junction to Maidenhead and, following a number of announcements and delays, the government announced in March 2011 that it would electrify the line between London and Cardiff together with the section linking Bristol Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads.&lt;ref name="railnews.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/general/2011/03/01-great-western-electrification-and-iep.html |publisher=RailNews|title=Great Western electrification and IEP to go ahead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Network Rail|2011|p=9}} In July 2012, the government announced that the final portion of the Great Western, from Cardiff to Swansea, would be electrified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/42bn-of-new-rail-schemes-unveiled-7945745.html |newspaper=The Independent |title=£4.2bn of new rail schemes unveiled |first=Peter |last=Woodman |date=16 July 2012 |agency=Press Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following delays to the original plan, and a major escalation of costs, the Conservative government announced in July 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/20/grayling-sparks-fury-by-scrapping-rail-electrification-plans|title=Grayling sparks fury by scrapping rail electrification plans|last=correspondent|first=Gwyn Topham Transport|date=2017-07-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, for the time being, the electrification would only be completed as far as Thingley Junction, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} west of Chippenham on the Swindon to Bristol Temple Meads section of the route. At the same time the Cardiff to Swansea section, that from Bristol Parkway to Bristol Temple Meads, and Didcot to Oxford were also postponed. The government argued that bi-mode trains will fill in the gaps pending completion of electrification, although the [[British Rail Class 800|Class 800]] trains are much slower in diesel mode than under electric power. The electrification as far as Didcot Parkway was completed in December 2017.

In addition to allowing Crossrail services with the new {{brc|345}} EMUs, the electrification allowed the introduction of {{brc|387}} EMUs by GWR. It was originally planned to bring second-hand {{brc|365}}s from [[Thameslink and Great Northern|Great Northern]] after the arrival of their new {{brc|700}} trains&lt;ref&gt;http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/policy/single-view/view/first-great-western-plans-at300s-to-cornwall.html&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later decided to order new Class 387s for GWR instead. Eight were delivered during 2016, with more on order to bring the total to 45. Some of the {{brc|165}} and {{brc|166}} DMUs currently used by GWR for Thames Valley services will be displaced to services on the lines around Cardiff and Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2015/03/24-derby-to-build-new-trains.html|title=Derby to build new trains for First Great Western|date=24 March 2015|website=Railnews|access-date=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line will also be used by the new [[Intercity Express Programme|Hitachi Super Express]] high speed trains – the {{brc|800}}s and {{brc|802}}s – which will gradually replace the [[InterCity 125]] and {{brc|180}} sets currently used for the long-distance services.

===Other proposals===
Network Rail plans to install [[European Rail Traffic Management System]] (ERTMS) in-cab signalling on the Great Western line;&lt;ref name="GvtRailElectricationPaper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/rail-electrification.pdf |title=DfT Rail Electrification paper |publisher=Dft.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170123080842/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/rail-electrification.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Network Rail|2011|p=11}} this is a pre-requisite for the [[Intercity Express Programme|Super Express]] trains to run at 140&amp;nbsp;mph (225&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Hitachi Super Express]] article&lt;/ref&gt;  Some or all of the resignalling work will be undertaken during the electrification work.&lt;ref name="GvtRailElectricationPaper"/&gt;

Further capacity improvements are also scheduled at Swindon, adding to recent changes and the new Platform 4.

Crossrail services are planned to terminate at Reading. Some of the current suburban services into London Paddington are planned to be transferred to the new Crossrail service, which will in turn free up some surface-level capacity at London Paddington.&lt;ref name="GvtRailElectricationPaper" /&gt;

Other more distant aspirations include resignalling and capacity improvements at Reading; the provision of four continuous tracks between Didcot and Swindon (including a grade-separated junction at Milton, where westbound relief line switches from the north side of the line to the south); and resignalling between Bath and Bristol to enable trains to run closer together.

Access to [[Heathrow Airport]] from the west remains an aspiration and the 2009 [[Heathrow Airtrack]] scheme, abandoned in 2011, proposed a route south of the Great Western main line to link the airport with Reading. Plans for electrification of the line will make it easier to access Heathrow from Reading, since lack of electrification between Reading station and Airport Junction (near West Drayton station) was a limiting factor.&lt;ref name="GvtRailElectricationPaper" /&gt; Plans under consideration in 2014 included new tunnels between Heathrow and [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heathrow rail link plan unveiled by Network Rail|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-26064200|accessdate=11 April 2015|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A local group is campaigning for the reopening of [[Saltford railway station|Saltford station]] between Bath and Bristol, to coincide with electrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rail-ly good news over station plan for Saltford|url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/Rail-ly-good-news-station-plan/story-25616274-detail/story.html|accessdate=11 April 2015|work=Bath Chronicle|publisher=Local World|date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been calls to reopen the former [[Wantage Road railway station|Wantage Road station]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29430204&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxfordshire County Council]] include a proposal for a new station to serve for Wantage and Grove in their 2015-2031 local transport plan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/cms/sites/default/files/folders/documents/roadsandtransport/transportpoliciesandplans/localtransportplan/ConnectingOxfordshirevol1policyandoverallstrategy.pdf Connecting Oxfordshire: Local Transport Plan 2015-2031]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major incidents==
*[[Slough rail accident]] - 16 June 1900 - An express train from Paddington to {{rws|Falmouth Docks}} ran through two sets of signals at danger and collided with a local train heading for [[Windsor &amp; Eton Central railway station|Windsor]]. Five passengers were killed and 35 seriously injured.
*[[Ealing rail crash]] - 19 December 1973 - A train from Paddington to Oxford derailed after a loose battery box cover on the [[British Rail Class 52|Class 52 "Western" locomotive]] hauling the train struck lineside equipment, causing a set of points to move under the train. Ten passengers were killed and 94 injured.
*[[Southall rail crash]] - 19 September 1997 - An [[InterCity 125]] service from {{rws|Swansea}} to Paddington, operated by [[First Great Western|Great Western Trains]], failed to stop at a red signal and collided with a freight train entering Southall goods yard. Seven people were killed and 139 were injured. The incident severely damaged public confidence in the safety of the rail system. It was found that the train's AWS was faulty, and the driver had been distracted (he had bent down to pack his bag). Great Western Trains was fined £1.5 million for violations of health and safety law in connection with the accident.
* [[Ladbroke Grove rail crash]] - 5 October 1999 - A [[Thames Trains]] service from Paddington to {{rws|Bedwyn}} passed a signal at danger at the gantry protecting a main set of (crossover) points between the one-way and bi-directionally used lines.

'''Hand warmers'''  are small (mostly disposable) packets which are held in the hand and produce heat on demand to warm cold hands. They are commonly used in outdoor activities. Other types of warmers are available to provide soothing heat for muscular or joint aches.

Depending on the type and the source of heat, hand warmers can last from 30 minutes (recrystallisation) up to 24 hours (platinum catalyst).
The hand warmer was created by Japanese inventor Niichi Matoba. Matoba received a patent for applying the principle of an oxidation reaction that produces heat by means of platinum catalysis. He then devoted his time to researching how to make the product suitable for practical use. In 1923, he manufactured a prototype of his device naming it HAKUKIN-kairo (HAKKIN warmer). A version of these original portable hand warmers is still produced in Japan.

== Types ==
===Air activated (iron)=== 
Air-activated hand warmers contain [[cellulose]], [[iron]], [[water]], [[activated carbon]], [[vermiculite]] (water reservoir) and [[salt]] and produce heat from the [[exothermic]] [[oxidation]] of iron when exposed to [[air]]. They typically emit heat for 1 to 10 hours, although the heat given off rapidly diminishes after 1–2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Warmer Hands (And Toes) Through Chemistry | publisher = ScienceIQ.com | accessdate = 2007-09-03 | url = http://www.scienceiq.com/Facts/WarmerHands.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swisseduc.ch/chemie/schwerpunkte/waermebeutel/docs/waermebeutel.pdf Handwärmer: Warme Hände, heisser Kopf]&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen molecules in the air react with iron, forming rust. Salt is often added to catalyze the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/68288-hand-warmers-work/|title= How Hand warmers work|date= February 2, 2014|accessdate= December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hand warmer.jpg|thumb|Crystallisation-type hand warmer with scale showing metal disc trigger]]
[[File:Hand warmer activation.webm|thumb|alt=A finger presses the metal disk trigger in the center of the hand warmer generating a nucleation center, initialising crystallisation. The contents changes from liquid to an insoluble solid and liquid mixture spreading out from the metal disk |Short clip showing the activation and crystallisation of a crystallisation-type reusable hand warmer.]]

===Supersaturated solution (crystallisation-type)===
{{See also|Sodium acetate#Heating pad}}

This type of hand warmers can be recharged by immersing the hand-warmer in very hot water until the contents are uniform and then allowing it to cool. The release of heat is triggered by flexing a small metal disk in the hand warmer, which generates [[nucleation]] centers that initiate crystallisation. Heat is required to dissolve the salt in its own water of crystallisation and it is this heat that is released when crystallisation is initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How do sodium acetate heat pads work? | publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]] | accessdate = 2007-09-03 | url = http://www.howstuffworks.com/question290.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[latent heat of fusion]] is about 264–289&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg.&lt;ref name=IDMA&gt;Ibrahim Dincer and Marc A. Rosen. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EsfcWE5lX40C&amp;q=latent+heat+of+fusion+sodium+acetate#search Thermal Energy Storage: Systems and Applications], page 155&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Pocket body warmer.jpg|left|thumb|Lighter fuel warmer (Hakukin brand, Peacock model)]]

This process can be scaled up to provide a domestic heating store developed by Sunamp Scotland&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-40188414 BBC Scotland 2017-06-08 From hand-warmer to house-warmer for tech firm]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sunamp.com/ Sunamp company site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lighter fuel===
Lighter fuel hand-warmers use [[lighter]] fluid (petroleum naptha). These can be re-used by simply refuelling. Typical models can generate heat for either half a day or a whole day, depending on conditions.

===Battery===
[[Image:XGUO_HandWarmer.jpg|thumb|A rechargeable electric hand warmer.&amp;nbsp; This device plugs into a USB port to charge its battery. It can also be used to charge or power other devices via USB.]]
Battery operated hand warmers use electrically resistive heating devices to convert electrical energy in the battery. Typically hand warmers can heat for up to six hours, with heat outputs from 40-48C. Rechargeable electronic hand warmers can be charged from a mains power supply or from a 5V USB power supply, with up to 500 recharge cycles possible.

===Charcoal===
[[Charcoal]]  hand-warmers provide heat by burning charcoal in a special case. These can last up to 6 hours and become comfortably hot. Charcoal cases for these usually have felt on the outside and have items in it that do not produce heat, but spread the heat such as metal. A charcoal hand warmer can start heating when both ends of charcoal are struck and then extinguished to create a hot charcoal. The smouldering stick is then placed inside the case. The charcoal sticks are available from most outdoor activity shops and are fairly inexpensive.

The '''Hostivické Ponds''' are a natural monument located at the western edge of [[Prague]], about 4&amp;nbsp;km from [[Zličín]] in the municipalities of [[Hostivice]], [[Břve]] and [[Litovice]]. This small-scale protected area was established on 14 October 1996 by the District Office of Western Prague with the aim of the conservation of natural communities of the Hostivické pond system.
{{stack|[[image:Hráz Litovického rybníka.JPG|thumb|right|Embankment of Litovice pond]]}}
In the adjacent [[wetlands]] and forests rare and endangered species of plants and animals can be found. During the reign of [[Rudolf II]] the fishponds in the area served as a source of water for [[Prague Castle]].

In 1972 rare fungus ''[[Haasiella|Haasiella venustissima]]'', previously found in only two localities in [[Czechoslovakia]], was found in the area. Also found in the reeds are tufted sedge (''[[Carex cespitosa]]''), bistort (''[[Persicaria bistorta]]'') and great burnet (''[[Sanguisorba officinalis]]''). In the past [[western marsh orchid]]s and [[black poplar]]s, could be found, but they have not been seen in recent years.

==History==
[[image:Hostivické rybníky - mapa.png|thumb|150px|left|Map showing the boundaries of natural sights]]
Litovická valley attracted to the settlement as early as the [[Neolithic]] ([[New Stone Age]]). The oldest settlement in Hostivice ponds is supported by the present village on the hill and at the top Břve [[Krahulov]]. The mere mention of Hostivice dates from the 14th century. All three villages united under one domain Gothard Zdarsky Zdar from around 1640.

From a historical perspective, it was important that the pond system served as the source region of water for water supply, supplying the [[Prague Castle]] during the [[reign]] of [[Rudolf II]].

On the [[shore]] of the pond [[Břevského]] was then built camp, which was subsequently abandoned. Currently, the buildings in the camp removed. This area is often used for [[Crime|illegal]] [[waste]] disposal. [[Natural Monument]] Hostivické ponds was established in 1996 and since that time the development of its old Czech Union for Nature Conservation, in particular its basic organization in Hostivice.

'''Hovensa''' (known also as '''St. Croix Refinery''')  was a petroleum refinery located on the island of [[St. Croix]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands]]. The refinery was a joint venture between [[Hess Corporation]] and [[Petroleos de Venezuela]]. For most of its operating life as HOVENSA it supplied heating oil and gasoline to the U.S. Gulf Coast and the eastern seaboard with the crude mainly sourced from [[Venezuela]]. Previously it had sourced its crude feedstock from a number of other countries including [[Libya]]. At a capacity of about {{convert|500000|oilbbl/d}} as of 2010 it was in the top 10 largest refineries in the world.&lt;ref name=downstream151008&gt;

A '''humistor''' is a type of [[variable resistor]] whose [[Resistance (electricity)|resistance]] varies based on [[humidity]].

== Construction ==
A humistor has a [[Ceramic Composition and Properties|ceramic composition]] comprising at least one component having a [[spinel]] type cubic symmetry selected from the group consisting of MgCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O4, FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, NiCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CoCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, MnCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CuCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and, if desired, at least one component selected from the group consisting of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|4086556}}  Humidity sensitive ceramic resistor. &lt;/ref&gt; A humidity sensor has a sensing portion which usually comprises a humidity-sensitive resistor composed of an [[organic polymer]], such as a [[polyamide]] resin, [[polyvinyl chloride]] or [[polyethylene]], or a [[metal oxide]].

==Operation==
A capacitive humidity sensor detects humidity based on a change of [[capacitance]] between two detection electrodes provided on a [[semiconductor]] substrate. The capacitance type humidity sensor detects humidity by measuring the change in the [[electrostatic]] capacity of an element corresponding to the ambient humidity. A resistive humidity sensor detects relative humidity by measuring the change in the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of an element corresponding to the ambient humidity. Most of the resistance type humidity sensors include an [[electrolytic]], polymeric, or metallic oxide sensor element. An impedance humidity sensor changes its [[electrical impedance]] as the humidity of the surrounding environment changes, and the measured impedance is converted into humidity readings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronics-manufacturers.com/products/sensors-transducers-detectors/humidity-sensor/ Electronics Manufacturers: Humidity sensors]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Humidity sensors can be used not only to measure the humidity in an atmosphere but also to automatically control [[humidifiers]], [[dehumidifiers]], and air conditioners for humidity adjustment.

'''Leven Beach Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] located on the north coast of the lower part of [[Yorke Peninsula]] within the boundaries of the gazetted localities of  [[Point Souttar, South Australia|Point Souttar]] and [[The Pines, South Australia|The Pines]] about {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} west north-west of [[Point Turton, South Australia|Point Turton]].&lt;ref name=PLB&gt;{{cite web|title=Search result for "Leven Beach Conservation Park" (Record no SA0039233) with the following layers being selected - "Suburbs and Localities" and "Place names (gazetteer)" |url=http://maps.sa.gov.au/plb/# |publisher=Government of South Australia |date= |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservation park was proclaimed in 1988 for the purpose of conserving ‘sheoak woodland and potentially provides habitat for a nationally endangered species of butterfly, the [[Hesperilla flavescens|Yellowish Sedge-skipper Butterfly]]’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainland Conservation Parks of Yorke Peninsula Management Plan 2009|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/40ccb65e-c97a-4f04-af74-9e4f00b16e48/mainland-cps-of-yp-mp.pdf|publisher=Department for Environment and Heritage|accessdate=15 July 2014|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3179">The '''Little Box Challenge''' was an engineering competition run by [[Google]] and the [[IEEE]]'s Power Electronics Society.&lt;ref name="Tweed2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stockton2014"/&gt; The original challenge was posted on July 22, 2014 with modifications on December 16, 2014 and March 23, 2015.&lt;ref name="Reqs"/&gt; Testing was in October 2015 at the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]]. From the 18 finalists, CE+T Power's team called ''Red Electrical Devils'' won the $1 million prize, which was awarded to them in March 2016.&lt;ref name="Russell2016"/&gt;

The challenge was to build a [[power inverter]] that was about 10 times smaller than the state-of-the-art at the time. It had to have an efficiency greater than 95 percent and handle loads of 2 kVA. It also had to fit in a metal enclosure of no more than 40 cubic inches (the eponymous "little box") and withstand 100 hours of testing.&lt;ref name="Reqs"/&gt;

The goals of the competition were lower cost solar [[photovoltaic]] power, more efficient [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]], affordable [[microgrids]], and the ability to use an electric vehicle's battery as backup power during a [[power outage]]. Google also hoped a smaller inverter could make its data centers run more efficiently.&lt;ref name="Tweed2014"/&gt;

'''MARMOK-A-5''' is an offshore electrical power generator that uses wave energy to create electricity. This device is a spar buoy installed in the maritime testing site Bimep, in the Bay of Biscay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tidalenergytoday.com/2016/10/13/wave-energy-device-hits-bimep-waters/|title=Wave energy device hits Bimep waters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wave energy device successfully deployed at BiMEP site|url=https://phys.org/news/2016-11-energy-device-successfully-deployed-bimep.html|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opera"&gt;{{cite web|title=OCEANTEC deployed at BiMEP its first wave energy converter - OPERA H2020|url=http://opera-h2020.eu/?p=657|website=OPERA H2020|accessdate=1 January 2018|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first grid connected maritime generator in Spain, and one of the first in the word.

Developed by the Basque company Oceantec Energias Marinas inside the European project OPERA, it is delivering electrical energy to the grid since December 2016. The buoy is located in the ocean, 4Km from the coastline and is connected to the sea with a submarine electrical cable. With a nominal power of 30kW, the principal aim of the MARMOK-A-5 device is obtaining results in the way of designing a new generation cost effective high power marine energy generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tecnalia.com/es/energia-medioambiente/noticias/oceantec-instala-en-bimep-su-primer-dispositivo-para-el-aprovechamiento-de-la-energia-de-las-olas.htm |date=2016-10-13 |title=Oceantec instala en BiMEP su primer dispositivo para el aprovechamiento de la energía de las olas}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle ==
The operation principle of MARMOK-A-5 is a point absorber OWC ([[Oscillating Water Column]]). The device is 5m in diameter and a length of 42m,&lt;ref name="Hydroworld"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oceantec wave energy device online in Spain|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2016/11/oceantec-marmok-a-5-commissioned-at-bimep-in-spain.html|website=Hydroworld|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6m above the water. It has a weight of more than 80 tons. The bouy is floating in a 90m depth and is tied to the sea bed with a mooring system based on anchors. This wave energy converter has demonstrated its robustness surviving difficult environmental conditions with waves as big as 12m.

[[Units of measurement]] used in [[Malaysia]] and neighbouring countries include the ''[[Catty|kati]]'', a unit of [[mass]], and the ''gantang'', a unit of [[volume]].

== Mass ==

In measuring amount by mass, the common unit is ''[[Catty|kati]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singlishdictionary.com/singlish_K.htm#kati "Kati" entry] at A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English.&lt;/ref&gt; which is about 1{{fraction|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;lb (604.79 g).&lt;ref name="my_law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Weights and Measures Act 1972 |work=Laws of Malaysia |url=http://www.kpdnkk.gov.my/akta-timbang-dan-sukat-1972 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201182503/http://www.kpdnkk.gov.my/akta-timbang-dan-sukat-1972 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A higher unit is ''[[Picul|pikul]]'' or ''picul'', which is 100 ''kati'' or {{convert|133.333|lb}}.&lt;ref name="Xinhua Zidian"&gt;新华字典 (''[[Xīnhuá Zìdiǎn]]''), Peking, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Volume ==
{{Other uses|Gantang (disambiguation)}}
In measuring amount by volume, the common unit is ''gantang'' (gallon), which is  equivalent to {{convert|1|impgal|lk=on}} or 8 pints. 
To make it clear,
Gantang equals a Gallon. A Gallon has sub measurements of 4 Quarts, or 8 Pints, or 16 Cups. A Gantang has sub measurements of 4 Churpak, or 8 Leng, or 16 Chentong. 
Churpak equals a Quart.
Leng equals a Pint.
Chentong equals a Cup.&lt;ref&gt;

''Chentong'' is also normally used only in certain areas, and so eight ''leng'' makes up a ''gantang''.

When used to measure unhusked rice, a ''gantang'' weights about {{convert|4|to|5|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}.

Fascinated by the rare breed of [[white tiger]] which was native to Rewa, he worked to protect the species and making the region poacher-free.&lt;ref name="Sharma2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. C.

After the abolition of royalty, Singh represented Rewa in the [[5th Lok Sabha]] (1971), [[7th Lok Sabha]] (1980) and the [[8th Lok Sabha]] (1984).&lt;ref name="Obituary: Maharaja Martand Singh of Rewa" /&gt; The Government of India awarded him the third-highest civilian honour of the [[Padma Bhushan]], in 1986, for his contributions to society.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2016 |accessdate=3 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U68ulwpb?url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singh was married to Princess Pravina of Kutch and the couple had one son.&lt;ref name="Last Maharaja of Rewa" /&gt; He died on 20 November 1995, at the age of 72.&lt;ref name="Obituary: Maharaja Martand Singh of Rewa" /&gt; He was again in the news in 2013 when his son filed a lawsuit regarding the allegedly illegal sale of ''Rewa Kothi'', their Mumbai bungalow with a reported value of {{INR}}2 billion, using a fake [[power of attorney]].

He went on to receive an M.S. in [[Statistics]] and Operations Research from [[Stanford University]] in 1964, and then attended [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he received a [[Ph.D.]] in Economics in 1967.

==Research==
Weitzman's research has covered a wide range of topics including Environmental and Natural Resource Economics, Green Accounting, Economics of Biodiversity, Economics of Environmental Regulation, Economics of Climate Change, Discounting, Comparative Economic Systems, Economics of Profit Sharing, Economic Planning, and Microfoundations of Macro Theory.

Much of Weitzman's research is focused on climate change. Traditional cost-benefit analysis of climate change looks at the costs of reducing [[global warming]] (the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions) versus the benefits (potentially stopping or slowing climate change). However, in most analyses, the damages that would stem from dramatic climate change are not taken into consideration. Weitzman has added dramatic [[climate change]] to the [[cost-benefit analysis]] to show that immediate measures must be taken in regards to climate change regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/weitzman/files/REStatModeling.pdf|title=On Modeling and Interpreting the Economics of Catastrophic Climate Change|author="Martin Weitzman"|date=2008-06-05|accessdate=2008-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013224417/http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/weitzman/files/REStatModeling.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weitzman's past research was focused on fixed versus profit sharing wages and their effect on unemployment. He proposed that when firms use profit sharing wages, meaning employees receive higher wages when a company is doing well, firms have lower rates of unemployment and do better during recessions.

Another topic of research that Weitzman is well known for is his study of price versus quantity controls.  Weitzman proposed a theory that when faced with uncertainty the relative slopes of the marginal benefits versus the marginal costs must be examined in order to determine which type of control will be most effective.  For example, in the case of pollution, the relative slopes of marginal costs and marginal damages must be examined (the marginal benefits are the avoidance of the marginal damages). His research showed that if the slope of marginal costs is steeper, price controls are more effective and if the relative slope of marginal damages is steeper, then quantity controls are more effective.

==Books==
Weitzman has written three books: ''The Share Economy: Conquering Stagflation'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674805835 Weitzman, Martin L., "The Share Economy," Harvard University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Income, Wealth, and the Maximum Principle'', and, most recently, ''Climate Shock'',&lt;ref name="climateshockref"&gt;[https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10414.html Gernot Wagner &amp; Martin L. Weitzman, "Climate Shock: The Economic Consequences of a Hotter Planet", Princeton University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; jointly with [[Gernot Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gwagner.com Gernot Wagner official website, researcher and lecturer, Harvard University]&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Share Economy: Conquering Stagflation'', Weitzman proposes that a main cause of [[stagflation]] is paying workers a fixed wage, regardless of how the company is performing. He introduces an alternate labor payment system as a way of combating stagflation.
''Income, Wealth, and the Maximum Principle'' is a book geared towards advanced economic students particularly those who want to be able to formulate and solve complex allocation problems and who are interested in the relationship between income accounting and wealth or welfare. ''Climate Shock'' details how what we know about global warming is bad and what we don't know is potentially much worse.&lt;ref name="climateshockref" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/what-if-climate-scientists-are-guessing-wrong.html|title=What If Climate Scientists Are Guessing Wrong?|last=Chait|first=Jonathan|work=Daily Intelligencer|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Pilita|title=‘Climate Shock: The Economic Consequences of a Hotter Planet’, by Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman|url=https://www.ft.com/content/bc2016e2-d320-11e4-9b0a-00144feab7de|work=Financial Times|date=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The economic options for combatting climate change|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/economic-options-combatting-climate-change/|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Weitzman began his teaching career in 1967 as an assistant professor of economics at [[Yale University]]. Three years later Weitzman was promoted to be an associate professor, and he remained in this position until 1972; at this time he joined the faculty at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1972 still as an associate professor. In 1974, Weitzman became a professor at [[MIT]], where he taught until 1989. From 1986 to 1989, Weitzman was recognized as a Mitsui professor at MIT. In 1989, Weitzman became an Ernest E. Monrad Professor of Economics at Harvard University and has remained in this position for the last 18 years. He currently teaches two graduate courses:
Ec 2680 Environmental and Natural Resource Economics &amp; Ec 2690 Environmental Economics and Policy Seminar.

'''Mawsynram''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔ:|s|ɪ|n|ˌ|r|ʌ|m}}) is a village in the [[East Khasi Hills district]] of [[Meghalaya]] state in north-eastern [[India]], 65 kilometres from Shillong. Mawsynram receives one of the highest rainfalls in India.   It is reportedly the wettest place on Earth, with an average annual [[rainfall]] of {{convert|11,872|mm|in|lk=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wmo.asu.edu/#global |title=Global Weather &amp; Climate Extremes |website=Arizona State University World Meteorological Organization |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Meghalaya: The Wettest Place on Earth |work=The Atlantic | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2014/08/meghalaya-the-wettest-place-on-earth/100797/ |date=22 August 2014| accessdate = 2014-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = India's Mawsynram villagers who live in the wettest place in the world with 40 FEET of rain a year |work= Daily Mail Online | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2471421/Indias-Mawsynram-villagers-live-wettest-place-world-40-FEET-rain-year.html |date=22 October 2013| accessdate = 2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mawsynram, India|work=National Geographic | url = http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/365-photos/rain-mawsynram-india/ |date=4 February 2013| accessdate = 2014-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but that claim is disputed by [[Lloró]], [[Colombia]], which reported an average yearly rainfall of {{convert|12,717|mm|in|lk=on}} between 1952 and 1989&lt;ref&gt;http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/faunayflora/pacific1/cap10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacerda2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luiz Drude de Lacerda|title=Environmental Geochemistry in Tropical and Subtropical Environments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3th0bNos0OcC&amp;pg=PA177|date=2004|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-42540-3|pages=177–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[López de Micay]], also in Colombia, which reported {{convert|12892|mm|abbr=on}} per year between 1960 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/comment.html?entrynum=135#commenttop |title=Weather Extremes : New Wettest Place on Earth Discovered? - Weather Underground |work=wunderground.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031053635/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/comment.html?entrynum=135 |archivedate=2014-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiempo.com/ram/32180/descubierto-en-colombia-un-nuevo-lugar-mas-humedo-en-la-tierra/|title=¿Descubierto en Colombia un nuevo lugar más húmedo en la Tierra?|work=tiempo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'', Mawsynram received {{convert|26,000|mm|in}} of [[rainfall]] in 1985.

==Location==
Mawsynram is located at 25° 18′ N, 91° 35′ E, at an altitude of about 1,400 metres (4,600&amp;nbsp;ft), 15&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Cherrapunji]], in the [[Khasi Hills]] in the state of [[Meghalaya]] ([[India]]) . The name of the village contains ''Maw'', a  [[Khasi language|Khasi]] word meaning ''stone''.

===Climate and rainfall===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Mawsynram features a [[subtropical highland climate]] with an extraordinarily showery and long monsoonal season and a short dry season. Based on the data of a recent few decades, it appears to be the wettest place in the world, or the place with the highest average annual rainfall. Mawsynram receives over 10,000 millimeters of rain in an average year, and the vast majority of rain it falls during the [[Monsoon of India|monsoon]] months. A comparison of rainfalls for [[Cherrapunji]] and Mawsynram for some years is given in Table 1.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tribune'', Chandigarh, August 2003. {{fcn|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily due to the high altitude, it seldom gets truly hot in Mawsynram. Average monthly temperatures range from around 11°C in January to just above 20°C in August. The village also experiences a brief but noticeably drier season from December until February, when monthly precipitation on average does not exceed {{convert|30|mm|in}}. The little precipitation during the village’s "low sun" season is something that is shared by many areas with this type of climate.

Three reasons can be cited for high rainfall at Mawsynram:{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}
#The warm moist winds of the northward-moving air from the [[Bay of Bengal]] during the [[Monsoon of India|monsoon]], which cover an extensive area but are forced to converge into the narrower zone over the Khasi Hills, thus concentrating their moisture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}
#The alignment of the Khasi Hills (east to west) places them directly in the path of the airflow from the Bay of Bengal, producing a significant [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]] (plus cooling, further condensation and thus more rain).{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}
#Finally, uplift over the [[Khasi Hills]] is virtually continuous in the [[Monsoon of India|monsoon]] period because the lifted air is constantly being pulled up by vigorous winds in the upper [[atmosphere]], hence the rainfall is more or less continuous.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Natural landmarks===
Located in Mawsynram, is a cave named Mawjymbuin, known for its [[stalagmites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Khasi Hills: Mawsynram|work=Department of Tourism, Government of Meghalaya| url = http://megtourism.gov.in/dest-khasi.html | accessdate = 2014-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside this cave is a pair of notable [[speleothem]]s - breast-shaped stalactite over a massive stalagmite. The area is known for its many caves, commercialised and non-commercialised, which contain remnants of a past that tells us of the history of the plateau that was once present.

Sharing many of its features with the [[Ford Explorer]], the vehicles were virtually identical in terms of hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/new/research/mercury/mountaineer.html Edmunds, 2006 Mountaineer review]&lt;/ref&gt; Externally, they were styled somewhat differently, and the Mountaineer was positioned with a more upscale interior, with the Mountaineer's [[suggested retail price|MSRP]] coming in at $1,000–$6,000 more than the Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2001/12/10/1210test.html Forbes, 2000 Mountaineer review]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was last redesigned for the 2006 model year with a new frame, looking very similar to its previous model.

Some controversy resulted after the media highlighted a number of rollovers involving Explorers and Mountaineers fitted with Firestone tires. The Mountaineer has been praised for its excellent handling and stability.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070216143700/http://www.edmunds.com/mercury/mountaineer/2007/review.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Mountaineer was never sold in Canada.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} As part of the discontinuation of the Mercury brand, production of the Mountaineer ended in late 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2010/07/12/mercury-production-to-cease-in-late-september/#comments "Mercury production to cease in late September?"] from Autoblog (July 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Wiki cars 076.jpg|left|thumb|Ford Explorer Limited (1993), indirect Ford predecessor of the Mercury Mountaineer]]
In 1991, General Motors introduced the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]] sport-utility vehicle, derived from the four-door [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]].  Though far lower in price, the Bravada was marketed as a competitor to the [[Range Rover]] (and the later [[Land Rover Discovery]]) and [[Toyota Land Cruiser]].  While sharing its body with the Blazer, Oldsmobile differentiated the Bravada with the use of model-specific trim and a dedicated all-wheel drive powertrain (in place of part-time four-wheel drive).  For 1993, Jeep briefly revived the long-running Grand Wagoneer nameplate as part of the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] model line, using [[Woodie (car body style)|woodgrain exterior trim]] and a leather interior; limited sales led to its cancellation after a single model year.

As a response to the Bravada and the Grand Wagoneer, Ford introduced the Ford Explorer Limited in 1993.  In contrast to the outdoors-themed Explorer Eddie Bauer, the Limited was geared towards on-road driving; it was fitted with all-wheel drive in place of traditional four-wheel drive.  The Limited was also distinguished by monochromatic body trim, body-color bumpers, and chrome wheels.

As part of the redesign of the Explorer for 1995, the Limited remained part of the Explorer lineup, with the segment gaining additional competitors through the use of badge engineering.  For 1996, the [[Acura SLX]] (Isuzu Trooper), [[Infiniti QX4]] (Nissan Pathfinder), and the larger [[Lexus LX450]] (Toyota Land Cruiser) were introduced together.

As these brands, along with Oldsmobile, competed more directly with luxury brands than the Ford model line, Ford Motor Company sought to develop SUVs for its Lincoln-Mercury division.  To minimize model overlap, Mercury was chosen to sell a version of the mid-size Ford Explorer, while Lincoln would sell a version of the then-upcoming full-size [[Ford Expedition]].

The Mercury Mountaineer was began production in late 1996 as a 1997 model.  As with the Ford Explorer Limited, the Mercury Mountaineer was offered only in a four-door body configuration.  After its first year, sales of the Mountaineer fell short of Lincoln-Mercury sales projections.  Following several revisions in 1997 and 1998, the Mountaineer would go on to become the third-best selling vehicle in the Mercury division, behind only the Sable and the Grand Marquis.

=== Body ===
At its launch, the Mercury Mountaineer was closest in appearance to the Ford Explorer XLT, though trimmed between the Explorer Eddie Bauer and Explorer Limited.  To differentiate it from its Ford counterpart, the Mountaineer was styled with a distinct dark-gray lower body color scheme; while visually similar to the Explorer, the Mountaineer adopted the chrome waterfall grille styling of the Grand Marquis.  While the taillights were model-specific, the rear hatch and bumper were shared with the European-export version of the Explorer.

As part of a 1998 model revision, the Mountaineer was given a model-specific grille and headlights, larger wheels, and a new rear hatch design.

=== Chassis ===
The 1997-2001 Mercury Mountaineer shares the chassis of the four-door Ford Explorer, following its 1995 redesign.  Though heavily based upon the first-generation Ford Ranger, the sport-utility vehicles are wider and are based on a separate wheelbase.  As with the Ford Explorer, the Mountaineer is fitted with fully independent wishbone front suspension.

For 1997, the Mercury Mountaineer was fitted with a 215hp 5.0L V8 with a 4-speed automatic transmission. In contrast to the Ford Explorer, the Mountaineer was available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive; part-time four-wheel drive was not available.  For 1998, a 205hp 4.0L V6 was added as an option.

=== Trim ===
The first-generation Mercury Mountaineer was introduced in a single trim level, offering many optional features of the Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer and Limited as standard.  For 1998, Mercury introduced a V6-engined version of the Mountaineer to expand its price range.  Though including a different powertrain, Mercury chose to offer largely the same features on both versions.

For the 2002 model year, the second-generation Mercury Mountaineer was introduced as a counterpart to the third-generation Ford Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20010506235803/http://www.2002mountaineer.com:80/nojavascript.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Previewed by a concept vehicle at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show#2000|2000 Los Angeles Auto Show]], the 2002 Mercury Mountaineer marked the introduction of a new design language for the Mercury line, with style elements later appearing on the Mercury Monterey, Mercury Mariner, Mercury Montego, and Mercury Milan; along with a silver waterfall grille and silver-trimmed taillamps.

As part of the redesign, the Mountaineer was given further differentiation from the Explorer; while sharing the same roofline and doors, much of the lower sheetmetal was different, with the Mountaineer having different front fenders and hood, front and rear bumpers, liftgate, and taillamps.

Sharing a chassis with the third-generation Ford Explorer, the Mountaineer was fitted with four-wheel independent suspension.  Sharing the 4.0L V6 of its predecessor, the second-generation Mountaineer also was fitted with the 4.6L V8 engine option of the Explorer, with four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive optional powertrain layouts; a 5-speed automatic transmission was standard.

In line with other Mercury models, the Mountaineer expanded from a single trim level to a base Convenience trim and a deluxe Premier trim; slotted above the Explorer Limited, the Mountaineer Premier offered features including a rear TV/DVD player, rear ceiling air vents, chrome exhaust tip and roof rack, and body-color bumpers.{{clear}}

}}
For the 2006 model year, Ford redesigned its mid-size SUVs.  While its [[Ford U platform#U2|U251 platform]] was all-new, the third-generation Mountaineer followed on with the success of its predecessor by retaining nearly its entire exterior, unlike the Explorer.  For the 2006 Mountaineer, the exterior redesign featured all-white taillamps, turn signal repeaters on the front fenders, larger wheels, satin silver trim on the sideview mirrors and bumpers; the Mercury logos on the grille and tailgate were enlarged.

Since the discontinuation of the [[Lincoln Aviator]] left the Mountaineer as the top nameplate of the Ford mid-size SUV model lineup, much of the attention of the redesign was focused in the interior trim and features to better differentiate it from the Explorer Eddie Bauer and Limited.  Carried over from the Lincoln Aviator was the option of a DVD-based navigation system with voice control; this system would be unavailable on the Explorer until 2008.  As an option, power retracting running boards (as seen on the Lincoln Navigator) were a new feature.

As with all Mountaineers since 2001, a 210&amp;nbsp;hp [[Ford Cologne V6 engine#SOHC|4.0L SOHC V6]] was the standard engine.  As with the Explorer, the 292&amp;nbsp;hp [[Ford Modular engine#4.6L#3-valve|4.6L Modular 24-valve V8]] was an option.  V6 Mountaineers used a 5-speed 5R55W automatic transmission.  For V8 models, Ford developed an all-new 6-speed transmission based on a ZF design; the 6R automatic was fitted to all V8 Explorers and Mountaineers.

During its production, this generation saw relatively few functional changes.  In 2008, side curtain airbags became standard.  On the outside, the ''"MOUNTAINEER"'' lettering was deleted from the front doors.  Due to reliability issues, the retracting running boards were discontinued.  For 2009, versions of the Mountaineer configured for towing were upgraded as trailer sway control was made standard.  To potentially save fuel for drivers, the navigation system was given upgrades, including traffic flow monitoring and live updates on gasoline prices from nearby service stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmunds.com/mercury/mountaineer/2009/review.html&lt;/ref&gt;  For 2010, Ford's [[MyKey]] was added as a standard feature on all trim levels; it is a programmable security system designed for vehicles owned by multiple drivers.

== Discontinuation ==
Following the June 2010 announcement by Ford Motor Company to shelve the Mercury brand, 2010 would be the end of Mountaineer production; the final vehicle was produced on October 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=32749 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514121635/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=32749 |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the Milan, Mariner, and Grand Marquis, the Mountaineer was not produced for a short 2011 model year.  The third-best selling vehicle of the division in 2000, the Mountaineer was the worst-selling Mercury ten years later.  {{clear}}

==Firestone tire controversy==
{{main|Firestone vs Ford Motor Company controversy}}

In May 2000, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) contacted [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] about the high incidence of tire failure on first generation [[Mercury Mountaineer#first generation|Mercury Mountaineers]], first and second generation [[Ford Explorer#first generation|Ford Explorers]], and [[Mazda Navajo|Mazda Navajo 3-doors]] fitted with Firestone tires. Ford investigated and found that several models of 15-inch (381&amp;nbsp;mm) Firestone tires (''ATX'', ''ATX II'', and ''Wilderness AT'') had very high failure rates, especially those made at Firestone's [[Decatur, Illinois]] plant. To this day the Ford Motor Company refuses to equip any vehicle they sell with Firestones. Individuals can still opt to purchase tires aftermarket though.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35590">In [[mathematics]], a '''metric space''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] for which [[Metric (mathematics)|distances]]  between all [[Element (mathematics)|members]] of the set are defined. Those distances, taken together, are  called a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the set. A metric on a space induces [[topological properties]] like [[open set|open]] and [[closed set]]s, which lead to the study of more abstract [[topological space]]s.

The most familiar metric space is [[3-dimensional Euclidean space]]. In fact, a "metric" is the generalization of the [[Euclidean metric]] arising from the four long-known properties of the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean metric  defines the distance between two points as the length of the [[Straight line|straight]] [[line segment]] connecting them. Other metric spaces occur for example in [[elliptic geometry]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], where distance on a [[sphere]] measured by angle is a metric, and the [[hyperboloid model]] of hyperbolic geometry is used by [[special relativity]] as a metric space of [[velocities]].

== History ==
{{Expand section|Reasons for generalizing the Euclidean metric, first non-Euclidean metrics studied, consequences for mathematics|date=August 2011}}

In 1906 [[Maurice Fréchet]] introduced metric spaces in his work ''Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel''.&lt;ref&gt;Rendic. Circ. Mat. Palermo 22 (1906) 1–74&lt;/ref&gt; However the name is due to [[Felix Hausdorff]].

== Definition ==

A '''metric space''' is an [[ordered pair]] &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]

:&lt;math&gt;d \colon M \times M \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

such that for any &lt;math&gt;x, y, z \in M&lt;/math&gt;, the following holds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=B. Choudhary|title=The Elements of Complex Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5K9i2YwgTjYC&amp;pg=PA20|year=1992|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-0399-2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first condition follows from the other three. Since for any &lt;math&gt;x, y \in M&lt;/math&gt;:

:{|

|}

The function &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is also called ''distance function'' or simply ''distance''. Often, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is omitted and one just writes &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used.

Ignoring mathematical details, for any system of roads and terrains the distance between two locations can be defined as the length of the shortest route connecting those locations. To be a metric there shouldn't be any one-way roads. The triangle inequality expresses the fact that detours aren't shortcuts. If the distance between two points is zero, the two points are indistinguishable from one-another. Many of the examples below can be seen as concrete versions of this general idea.

== Examples of metric spaces == &lt;!-- [[Finite Metric space]] redirects here--&gt;
* The [[real number]]s with the distance function &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \vert y - x \vert&lt;/math&gt; given by the [[absolute difference]], and, more generally, [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space]] with the [[Euclidean distance]], are [[complete space|complete]] metric spaces. The [[rational number]]s with the same distance function also form a metric space, but not a complete one.
* The [[positive real numbers]] with distance function &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) =\vert \log(y/x) \vert&lt;/math&gt; is a complete metric space.
* Any [[normed vector space]] is a metric space by defining &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \lVert y - x \rVert&lt;/math&gt;, see also [[Metric (mathematics)#Metrics on vector spaces|metrics on vector spaces]]. (If such a space is [[Complete metric space|complete]], we call it a [[Banach space]].) Examples:
** The [[Norm (mathematics)#Taxicab norm or Manhattan norm|Manhattan norm]] gives rise to the [[Manhattan distance]], where the distance between any two points, or vectors, is the sum of the differences between corresponding coordinates.
** The [[maximum norm]] gives rise to the [[Chebyshev distance]] or chessboard distance, the minimal number of moves a [[king (chess)|chess king]] would take to travel from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[British Rail]] metric (also called the “post office metric” or the “[[SNCF]] metric”) on a [[normed vector space]] is given by &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \lVert x \rVert + \lVert y \rVert&lt;/math&gt; for distinct points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d(x,x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. More generally &lt;math&gt;\lVert . \rVert&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced with a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; taking an arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to non-negative reals and taking the value &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; at most once:  then the metric is defined on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = f(x) + f(y)&lt;/math&gt; for distinct points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d(x,x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  The name alludes to the tendency of railway journeys to proceed via London (or Paris) irrespective of their final destination.
* If &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a metric space by restricting the domain of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X \times X&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[discrete metric]], where &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise, is a simple but important example, and can be applied to all sets. This, in particular, shows that for any set, there is always a metric space associated to it. Using this metric, any point is an [[open ball]], and therefore every subset is open and the space has the [[discrete topology]].
* A finite metric space is a metric space having a [[finite set|finite]] number of points.  Not every finite metric space can be [[Isometry|isometrically]] embedded in a [[Euclidean space]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nati Linial|Nathan Linial]].

* The [[hyperbolic geometry#Models of the hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic plane]] is a metric space. More generally:
** If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is any [[connectedness|connected]] [[Riemannian manifold]], then we can turn &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; into a metric space by defining the distance of two points as the [[infimum]] of the lengths of the paths (continuously differentiable [[curve]]s) connecting them.
** If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is some set and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space, then, the set of all [[bounded function]]s &lt;math&gt;f \colon X \rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. those functions whose image is a [[bounded subset]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;) can be turned into a metric space by defining &lt;math&gt;d(f,g) = \sup_{x \in X} d(f(x),g(x))&lt;/math&gt; for any two bounded functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt; is [[supremum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Searcóid, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aP37I4QWFRcC&amp;pg=PA107 p. 107].&lt;/ref&gt; This metric is called the [[uniform metric]] or supremum metric, and If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is complete, then this [[function space]] is complete as well. If ''X'' is also a topological space, then the set of all bounded [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] functions from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (endowed with the uniform metric), will also be a complete metric if ''M'' is.
** If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is an [[graph theory|undirected connected graph]], then the set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of vertices of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can be turned into a metric space by defining &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; to be the length of the shortest path connecting the vertices &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. In [[geometric group theory]] this is applied to the [[Cayley graph]] of a group, yielding the [[word metric]].
* [[Graph edit distance]] is a measure of dissimilarity between two [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], defined as the minimal number of [[Graph operations|graph edit operations]] required to transform one graph into another.
* The [[Levenshtein distance]] is a measure of the dissimilarity between two [[string (computer science)|strings]] &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, defined as the minimal number of character deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. This can be thought of as a special case of the shortest path metric in a graph and is one example of an [[edit distance]].
* Given a metric space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; and an increasing [[concave function]] &lt;math&gt;f \colon [0,\infty) \rightarrow [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f \circ d&lt;/math&gt; is also a metric on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* Given an [[injective function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; from any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to a metric space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(f(x), f(y))&lt;/math&gt; defines a metric on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
* Using [[T-theory]], the [[tight span]] of a metric space is also a metric space. The tight span is useful in several types of analysis.
* The set of all &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over some [[field (mathematics)|field]] is a metric space with respect to the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] distance &lt;math&gt;d(X,Y) = \mathrm{rank}(Y - X)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[Helly metric]]  is used in [[game theory]].

== Open and closed sets, topology and convergence ==
Every metric space is a [[topological space]] in a natural manner, and therefore all definitions and theorems about general topological spaces also apply to all metric spaces.

About any point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in a metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; we define the '''[[open ball]] of radius &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a real number) about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''' as the set
:&lt;math&gt;B(x;r) = \{y \in M : d(x,y) &lt; r\}.&lt;/math&gt;
These open balls form the [[base (topology)|base]] for a topology on ''M'', making it a [[topological space]].

Explicitly, a subset &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is called '''[[open set|open]]''' if for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; there exists an &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B(x;r)&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. The [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of an open set is called '''[[closed set|closed]]'''. A [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is any subset of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; that contains an open ball about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as a subset.

A topological space which can arise in this way from a metric space is called a '''metrizable''' space; see the article on [[metrization theorems]] for further details.

A [[sequence]] (&lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;) in a metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is said to [[limit of a sequence|converge]] to the limit &lt;math&gt;x \in M&lt;/math&gt; [[iff]] for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a natural number ''N'' such that &lt;math&gt;d(x_n,x) &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, one can use the general definition of convergence available in all topological spaces.

A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of the metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is closed iff every sequence in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that converges to a limit in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has its limit in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

== Types of metric spaces ==

===Complete spaces===
{{Main|Complete metric space}}

A metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''complete''' if every [[Cauchy sequence]] converges in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. That is to say: if &lt;math&gt;d(x_n, x_m) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as both &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; independently go to infinity, then there is some &lt;math&gt;y\in M&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d(x_n, y) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Every [[Euclidean space]] is complete, as is every closed subset of a complete space. The rational numbers, using the absolute value metric &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \vert x - y \vert&lt;/math&gt;, are not complete.

Every metric space has a unique (up to [[isometry]]) [[completion (metric space)|completion]], which is a complete space that contains the given space as a [[dense set|dense]] subset. For example, the real numbers are the completion of the rationals.

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a complete subset of the metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is closed in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, a space is complete [[iff]] it is closed in any containing metric space.

Every complete metric space is a [[Baire space]].

===Bounded and totally bounded spaces===
[[File:Diameter of a Set.svg|thumb|Diameter of a set.]]
{{See also|bounded set}}
A metric space ''M'' is called '''bounded''' if there exists some number ''r'', such that ''d''(''x'',''y'') ≤ ''r'' for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''M''.  The smallest possible such ''r'' is called the '''[[diameter]]''' of ''M''. The space ''M'' is called '''precompact''' or '''[[totally bounded]]''' if for every ''r'' &gt; 0 there exist finitely many open balls of radius ''r'' whose union covers ''M''. Since the set of the centres of these balls is finite, it has finite diameter, from which it follows (using the triangle inequality) that every totally bounded space is bounded.  The converse does not hold, since any infinite set can be given the discrete metric (one of the examples above) under which it is bounded and yet not totally bounded.

Note that in the context of [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]s in the space of [[real number]]s and occasionally regions in a Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt; a bounded set is referred to as "a finite interval" or "finite region". However boundedness should not in general be confused with "finite", which refers to the number of elements, not to how far the set extends; finiteness implies boundedness, but not conversely. Also note that an unbounded subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R ^n&lt;/math&gt; may have a finite [[Lebesgue measure|volume]].

===Compact spaces===
A metric space ''M'' is compact if every sequence in ''M'' has a [[subsequence]] that converges to a point in ''M''. This is known as [[sequentially compact space|sequential compactness]] and, in metric spaces (but not in general topological spaces), is equivalent to the topological notions of [[countably compact space|countable compactness]] and [[compact space|compactness]] defined via [[open cover]]s.

Examples of compact metric spaces include the closed interval [0,1] with the absolute value metric, all metric spaces with finitely many points, and the [[Cantor set]]. Every closed subset of a compact space is itself compact.

A metric space is compact [[iff]] it is complete and totally bounded.  This is known as the [[Heine–Borel theorem]]. Note that compactness depends only on the topology, while boundedness depends on the metric.

[[Lebesgue's number lemma]] states that for every open cover of a compact metric space ''M'', there exists a "Lebesgue number" δ such that every subset of ''M'' of [[diameter]] &lt; δ is contained in some member of the cover.

Every compact metric space is [[second countable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/CompactMetricSpacesAreSecondCountable.html|title=PlanetMath: a compact metric space is second countable&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=planetmath.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205003114/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/CompactMetricSpacesAreSecondCountable.html|archivedate=5 February 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a continuous image of the [[Cantor set]]. (The latter result is due to [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn|Urysohn]].)

===Locally compact and proper spaces===
A metric space is said to be [[locally compact]] if every point has a compact neighborhood. Euclidean spaces are locally compact, but infinite-dimensional Banach spaces are not.

A space is [[proper space|proper]] if every closed ball {''y'' : ''d''(''x'',''y'') ≤ ''r''} is compact. Proper spaces are locally compact, but the converse is not true in general.

===Connectedness===
A metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is [[connected space|connected]] if the only subsets that are both open and closed are the empty set and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; itself.

A metric space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is [[connectedness|path connected]] if for any two points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in M&lt;/math&gt; there exists a continuous map &lt;math&gt;f\colon [0,1] \to M&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f(0)=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(1)=y&lt;/math&gt;.
Every path connected space is connected, but the converse is not true in general.

There are also local versions of these definitions: [[locally connected space]]s and [[connectedness|locally path connected spaces]].

[[Simply connected space]]s are those that, in a certain sense, do not have "holes".

===Separable spaces===
A metric space is [[separable space]] if it has a [[countable]] [[dense set|dense]] subset. Typical examples are the real numbers or any Euclidean space. For metric spaces (but not for general topological spaces) separability is equivalent to [[second-countable space|second-countability]] and also to the [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]] property.

===Pointed metric spaces===
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty metric space and &lt;math&gt;x_0\in X&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''pointed metric space'', and &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''distinguished point''.  Note that a pointed metric space is just a nonempty metric space with attention drawn to its distinguished point, and that any nonempty metric space can be viewed as a pointed metric space. The distinguished point is sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; due to its similar behavior to zero in certain contexts.

==Types of maps between metric spaces==
Suppose (''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are two metric spaces.

===Continuous maps===
{{Main|Continuous function (topology)}}

The map ''f'':''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;→''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[continuous map|continuous]]
if it has one (and therefore all) of the following equivalent properties:
;General topological continuity: for every open set ''U'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[preimage]] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') is open in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:This is the general definition of [[Continuity (topology)|continuity in topology]].
;Sequential continuity: if (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a sequence in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that converges to ''x'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the sequence (''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) converges to ''f''(''x'') in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:This is [[sequential continuity]], due to [[Eduard Heine]].
;ε-δ definition: for every ''x'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and every ε&gt;0 there exists δ&gt;0 such that for all ''y'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; we have
::&lt;math&gt;d_1(x,y)&lt;\delta \Rightarrow d_2(f(x),f(y))&lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
:This uses the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]], and is due to [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]].

Moreover, ''f'' is continuous if and only if it is continuous on every compact subset of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The [[image (mathematics)|image]] of every compact set under a continuous function is compact, and the image of every connected set under a continuous function is connected.

===Uniformly continuous maps===
The map ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]] if for every ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0 there exists ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;d_1(x,y)&lt;\delta \Rightarrow d_2(f(x),f(y))&lt; \varepsilon \quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Every uniformly continuous map ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is continuous.  The converse is true if ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is compact ([[Heine–Cantor theorem]]).

Uniformly continuous maps turn Cauchy sequences in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into Cauchy sequences in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For continuous maps this is generally wrong; for example, a continuous map
from the open interval (0,1) ''onto'' the real line turns some Cauchy sequences into unbounded sequences.

===Lipschitz-continuous maps and contractions===
{{Main|Lipschitz continuity}}

Given a real number ''K''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0, the map ''ƒ''&amp;nbsp;: ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Lipschitz continuity|''K''-Lipschitz continuous]] if

:&lt;math&gt;d_2(f(x),f(y))\leq K d_1(x,y)\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Every Lipschitz-continuous map is uniformly continuous, but the converse is not true in general.

If ''K'' &lt; 1, then ''ƒ'' is called a [[contraction mapping|contraction]]. Suppose ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is complete. If ''ƒ'' is a contraction, then ''ƒ'' admits a unique fixed point ([[Banach fixed point theorem]]). If ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is compact, the condition can be weakened a bit: ''ƒ'' admits a unique fixed point if

:&lt;math&gt; d(f(x), f(y)) &lt; d(x, y) \quad \mbox{for all} \quad x \ne y \in M_1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Isometries===
The map ''f'':''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;→''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[isometry]] if
:&lt;math&gt;d_2(f(x),f(y))=d_1(x,y)\quad\mbox{for all}\quad x,y\in M_1&lt;/math&gt;
Isometries are always [[injective]]; the image of a compact or complete set under an isometry is compact or complete, respectively. However, if the isometry is not [[surjective]], then the image of a closed (or open) set need not be closed (or open).

===Quasi-isometries===
The map ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[quasi-isometry]] if there exist constants ''A''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 and ''B''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{A} d_2(f(x),f(y))-B\leq d_1(x,y)\leq A d_2(f(x),f(y))+B \text{ for all } x,y\in M_1&lt;/math&gt;

and a constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 such that every point in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a distance at most ''C'' from some point in the image&amp;nbsp;''f''(''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).

Note that a quasi-isometry is not required to be continuous. Quasi-isometries compare the "large-scale structure" of metric spaces; they find use in [[geometric group theory]] in relation to the [[word metric]].

==Notions of metric space equivalence==
Given two metric spaces (''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):

*They are called '''homeomorphic''' (topologically isomorphic) if there exists a [[homeomorphism]] between them (i.e., a [[bijection]] continuous in both directions).
*They are called '''uniformic''' (uniformly isomorphic) if there exists a [[uniform isomorphism]] between them (i.e., a [[bijection]] uniformly continuous in both directions).
*They are called '''isometric''' if there exists a [[bijective]] [[isometry]] between them. In this case, the two metric spaces are essentially identical.
*They are called '''quasi-isometric''' if there exists a [[quasi-isometry]] between them.

==Topological properties==
Metric spaces are [[paracompact]]&lt;ref&gt;Rudin, Mary Ellen.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2035708 A new proof that metric spaces are paracompact] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412015215/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2035708 |date=2016-04-12 }}.  Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 20, No. 2. (Feb., 1969), p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hausdorff space]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{planetmath reference|id=5838|title=metric spaces are Hausdorff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence [[normal space|normal]] (indeed they are perfectly normal). An important consequence is that every metric space admits [[partitions of unity]] and that every continuous real-valued function defined on a closed subset of a metric space can be extended to a continuous map on the whole space ([[Tietze extension theorem]]). It is also true that every real-valued [[Lipschitz maps|Lipschitz-continuous]] map defined on a subset of a metric space can be extended to a Lipschitz-continuous map on the whole space.

Metric spaces are [[first countable]] since one can use balls with rational radius as a neighborhood base.

The metric topology on a metric space ''M'' is the coarsest topology on ''M'' relative to which the metric ''d'' is a continuous map from the product of ''M'' with itself to the non-negative real numbers.

==Distance between points and sets; Hausdorff distance and Gromov metric==
A simple way to construct a function separating a point from a closed set (as required for a [[completely regular]] space) is to consider the [[Distance#Distances between sets and between a point and a set|distance between the point and the set]]. If (''M'',''d'') is a metric space, ''S'' is a [[subset]] of ''M'' and ''x'' is a point of ''M'', we define the distance from ''x'' to ''S'' as
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,S) = \inf\{d(x,s) : s \in S \} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\inf&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[infimum]].

Then ''d''(''x'', ''S'') = 0 if and only if ''x'' belongs to the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''S''. Furthermore, we have the following generalization of the triangle inequality:
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,S) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,S),&lt;/math&gt;
which in particular shows that the map &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto d(x,S)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

Given two subsets ''S'' and ''T'' of ''M'', we define their [[Hausdorff distance]] to be
:&lt;math&gt;d_H(S,T) = \max \{ \sup\{d(s,T) : s \in S \} , \sup\{ d(t,S) : t \in T \} \} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[supremum]].

In general, the Hausdorff distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'',''T'') can be infinite. Two sets are close to each other in the Hausdorff distance if every element of either set is close to some element of the other set.

The Hausdorff distance ''d''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; turns the set ''K''(''M'') of all non-empty compact subsets of ''M'' into a metric space. One can show that ''K''(''M'') is complete if ''M'' is complete.
(A different notion of convergence of compact subsets is given by the [[Kuratowski convergence]].)

One can then define the [[Gromov–Hausdorff convergence|Gromov–Hausdorff distance]] between any two metric spaces by considering the minimal Hausdorff distance of isometrically embedded versions of the two spaces. Using this distance, the class of all (isometry classes of) compact metric spaces becomes a metric space in its own right.

==Product metric spaces==
If &lt;math&gt;(M_1,d_1),\ldots,(M_n,d_n)&lt;/math&gt; are metric spaces, and ''N'' is the [[Euclidean norm]] on ''R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', then &lt;math&gt;\Big(M_1\times \ldots \times M_n, N(d_1,\ldots,d_n)\Big)&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space, where the [[product metric]] is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;N(d_1,...,d_n)\Big((x_1,\ldots,x_n),(y_1,\ldots,y_n)\Big) = N\Big(d_1(x_1,y_1),\ldots,d_n(x_n,y_n)\Big),&lt;/math&gt;

and the induced topology agrees with the [[product topology]].  By the equivalence of norms in finite dimensions, an equivalent metric is obtained if ''N'' is the [[Norm (mathematics)#Taxicab norm or Manhattan norm|taxicab norm]], a [[Norm (mathematics)#p-norm|p-norm]], the [[Norm (mathematics)#Infinity norm or maximum norm|max norm]], or any other norm which is non-decreasing as the coordinates of a positive ''n''-tuple increase (yielding the triangle inequality).

Similarly, a countable product of metric spaces can be obtained using the following metric

:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac1{2^i}\frac{d_i(x_i,y_i)}{1+d_i(x_i,y_i)}.&lt;/math&gt;

An uncountable product of metric spaces need not be metrizable. For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is not [[first-countable space|first-countable]] and thus isn't metrizable.

===Continuity of distance===
In the case of a single space &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt;, the distance map &lt;math&gt;d\colon M\times M \rightarrow R^+&lt;/math&gt; (from the [[Metric space#Definition|definition]]) is uniformly continuous with respect to any of the above product metrics &lt;math&gt;N(d,d)&lt;/math&gt;, and in particular is continuous with respect to the product topology of &lt;math&gt;M\times M&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quotient metric spaces==
If ''M'' is a metric space with metric ''d'', and ''~'' is an [[equivalence relation]] on ''M'', then we can endow the quotient set ''M/~'' with the following (pseudo)metric. Given two equivalence classes [''x''] and [''y''], we define
:&lt;math&gt;d'([x],[y]) = \inf\{d(p_1,q_1)+d(p_2,q_2)+\dotsb+d(p_{n},q_{n})\}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[infimum]] is taken over all finite sequences &lt;math&gt;(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;[p_1]=[x]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;[q_n]=[y]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;[q_i]=[p_{i+1}], i=1,2,\dots, n-1&lt;/math&gt;. In general this will only define a [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;d'([x],[y])=0&lt;/math&gt; does not necessarily imply that &lt;math&gt;[x]=[y]&lt;/math&gt;. However, for nice equivalence relations (e.g., those given by gluing together polyhedra along faces), it is a metric.

The quotient metric ''d'' is characterized by the following [[universal property]]. If &lt;math&gt;f:(M,d)\longrightarrow(X,\delta)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric map]] between metric spaces (that is, &lt;math&gt;\delta(f(x),f(y))\le d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'') satisfying ''f''(''x'')=''f''(''y'') whenever &lt;math&gt;x\sim y,&lt;/math&gt; then the induced function &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}\colon M/\sim\longrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;, given by &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}([x])=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, is a metric map &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}\colon (M/\sim,d')\longrightarrow (X,\delta).&lt;/math&gt;

A topological space is [[sequential space|sequential]] if and only if it is a quotient of a metric space.&lt;ref&gt;Goreham, Anthony. [http://at.yorku.ca/p/a/a/o/51.pdf Sequential convergence in Topological Spaces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604232111/http://at.yorku.ca/p/a/a/o/51.pdf |date=2011-06-04 }}.

==Generalizations of metric spaces==
*Every metric space is a [[uniform space]] in a natural manner, and every uniform space is naturally a [[topological space]]. Uniform and topological spaces can therefore be regarded as generalizations of metric spaces.
*If we consider the first definition of a metric space [[#Definition|given above]] and relax the second requirement, we arrive at the concepts of a [[pseudometric space]] or a dislocated metric space.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Pascal Hitzler and Anthony Seda, Mathematical Aspects of Logic Programming Semantics. Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; If we remove the third or fourth, we arrive at a [[quasimetric space]], or a [[semimetric space]].
*If the distance function takes values in the [[extended real number line]] '''R'''∪{+∞}, but otherwise satisfies all four conditions, then it is called an ''extended metric'' and the corresponding space is called an ''&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;-metric space''. If the distance function takes values in some (suitable) ordered set (and the triangle inequality is adjusted accordingly), then we arrive at the notion of ''generalized ultrametric''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*[[Approach space]]s are a generalization of metric spaces, based on point-to-set distances, instead of point-to-point distances.
*A [[continuity space]] is a generalization of metric spaces and [[poset]]s, that can be used to unify the notions of metric spaces and [[Domain theory|domain]]s.
* A partial metric space is intended to be the least generalisation of the notion of a metric space, such that the distance of each point from itself is no longer necessarily zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/pmetric/|title=Partial metrics : welcome|author=|date=|website=www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727003912/http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/pmetric/|archivedate=27 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metric spaces as enriched categories ===
The ordered set &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R},\geq)&lt;/math&gt; can be seen as a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] by requesting exactly one [[morphism]] &lt;math&gt;a\to b&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;a\geq b&lt;/math&gt; and none otherwise. By using &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; as the [[tensor product]] and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; as the [[Identity element|identity]], it becomes a [[monoidal category]] &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt;.
Every metric space &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; can now be viewed as a category &lt;math&gt;M^*&lt;/math&gt; [[enriched category|enriched]] over &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt;:
* Set &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ob}(M^*):=M&lt;/math&gt;
* For each &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in M&lt;/math&gt; set &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(X,Y):=d(X,Y)\in \operatorname{Ob}(R^*)&lt;/math&gt;
* The composition morphism &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}(Y,Z)\otimes \operatorname{Hom}(X,Y)\to \operatorname{Hom}(X,Z)&lt;/math&gt; will be the unique morphism in &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; given from the triangle inequality &lt;math&gt;d(y,z)+d(x,y)\geq d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt;
* The identity morphism &lt;math&gt;0\to \operatorname{Hom}(X,X)&lt;/math&gt; will be the unique morphism given from the fact that &lt;math&gt;0\geq d(X,X)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Since &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; is a poset, all [[Diagram (category theory)|diagrams]] that are required for an enriched category commute automatically.

'''Mount Livadiyskaya''' ({{lang-ru|гора́ Ливади́йская}} or {{lang|ru|со́пка Ливади́йская}}), unofficially known as '''Mount Pedan''' ({{lang|ru|Педа́н}}) or '''Mount Pidan''' ({{lang|ru|Пида́н}}) is one of the highest peaks in [[Shkotovsky District]] of [[Primorsky Krai]], [[Russia]].

Livadiyskaya is a part of the [[Livadiysky Range]] of the [[Sikhote-Alin]].

The history of the mountain is often mystified, due to the presence of [[megalith]]s. These attract adepts of different [[neopagan]] and other faiths.

The mountain is a popular hiking spot, which has seen a surge in the number of ascensions in recent years.   This has resulted in worsening contamination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="938">In the physical sciences, a '''multilayer''' or '''stratified medium''' is a stack of different [[thin film]]s. Typically, a multilayer is man made for a specific purpose. Since layers are thin with respect to some relevant length scale, [[interface (matter)|interface]] effects are much more important than in bulk materials, giving rise to novel physical properties.

The term "multilayer" is ''not'' an extension of "[[monolayer]]" and "[[bilayer]]", which describe a ''single'' layer that is one or two molecules thick. A multilayer medium rather consists of several thin films.

== Examples ==

An [[optical coating]], as used for instance in a [[dielectric mirror]], is made of several layers that have different [[refractive index|refractive indexes]].

[[Giant magnetoresistance]] is a macroscopic quantum effect observed in alternating ferromagnetic and non-magnetic conductive layers.

'''Norther''' is an [[offshore wind farm]] to be built in the Belgian [[North Sea]], within the Exclusive Economic Zone of [[Belgium]], approximately 23 kilometres from the Belgian port of [[Ostend]].

[[Bottle]]s made of [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET, sometimes PETE) can be used to make lower grade products, such as carpets.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} To make a food grade plastic, the bottles need to be [[Hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] down to [[monomers]], which are purified and then [[Polymerization|re-polymerised]] to make new PET. 
In many countries, PET plastics are coded with the [[resin identification code]] number "1" inside the [[recycling symbol|universal recycling symbol]], usually located on the bottom of the container.

== Usage of PET ==
PET is used as a raw material for making [[packaging]] materials such as bottles and containers for packaging a wide range of food products and other [[consumer goods]]. Examples include [[soft drink]]s, [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[detergents]], [[cosmetics]], pharmaceutical products and [[Vegetable oil|edible oils]].  PET is one of the most common consumer plastics used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark Howard|first=Brian|title=Recycling Symbols on Plastics - What Do Recycling Codes on Plastics Mean|url=http://www.thedailygreen.com/green-homes/latest/recycling-symbols-plastics-460321?src=soc_fcbk|publisher=The Daily Green (Good Housekeeping)|accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyethylene terephthalate can also be used as the main material in [[Papermaking|making water-resistant paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = [[Teijin]] [[Corporate group|Group]]|title=Teijin Develops Eco-friendly Wet-strong Printing Paper Made 100% with Recycled Polyester Derived from Used PET Bottles|url=http://www.teijin.com/news/2013/ebd130312_00.html|publisher=Teijin Group|accessdate=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-consumer waste ===
The empty PET packaging is discarded by the [[consumer]], after use and becomes PET [[waste]].  In the recycling industry, this is referred to as "post-consumer PET."  Many local governments and waste collection agencies have started to collect post-consumer PET separately from other household waste. Besides that there is [[container deposit legislation]] in some countries which also applies to PET bottles.

It is debatable whether exporting circulating resources that damages the domestic recycling industry is acceptable or not.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hanaki: Urban Environmental Management and Technology, {{ISBN|9784431783978}}, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, overseas market pressure led to a significant cost reduction in the domestic market. The cost of the plastics other than PET bottles remained high.

|}

=== Sorting ===
When the PET bottles are returned to an authorized redemption center, or to the original seller in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly or fully refunded to the redeemer. In both cases the collected post-consumer PET is taken to recycling centres known as [[materials recovery facility|materials recovery facilities]] (MRF) where it is sorted and separated from other materials such as metal, objects made out of other rigid plastics such as [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[high density polyethylene|HDPE]], [[polypropylene]], flexible plastics such as those used for bags (generally low density [[polyethylene]]), drink cartons, glass, and anything else which is not made out of PET.

Post-consumer PET is often sorted into different colour fractions: transparent or uncoloured PET, blue and green coloured PET, and the remainder into a mixed colours fraction.  The emergence of new colours (such as amber for plastic beer bottles) further complicates the sorting process for the recycling industry.

|[[File:Bales Crushed PET Bottles.JPG|thumb|right|Bales of crushed PET bottles.]]
|}

=== Processing for sale ===
The sorted post-consumer PET waste is crushed, pressed into bales and offered for sale to recycling companies.  Colourless/light blue post-consumer PET attracts higher sales prices than the darker blue and green fractions.  The mixed color fraction is the least valuable.

=== Further treatment ===
The further treatment process includes crushing, washing, separating and drying.
Recycling companies further treat the post-consumer PET by shredding the material into small fragments.  These fragments still contain residues of the original content, shredded paper labels and plastic caps.  These are removed by [[plastic granulation]], resulting in pure PET fragments, or "PET flakes".  PET flakes are used as the raw material for a range of products that would otherwise be made of [[polyester]]. Examples include polyester fibres (a base material for the production of [[clothing]], [[pillow]]s, [[carpets]], etc.), polyester sheets, [[strapping]], or back into PET bottles.

==Melt filtration==
Melt filtration is typically used to remove contaminants from polymer melts during the extrusion process.&lt;ref&gt;Melt Filtration [http://www.p2pays.org/ref/14/13545.pdf Options and Alternatives]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a mechanical separation of the contaminants within a machine called a ‘screen changer’. A typical system will consist of a steel housing with the filtration medium contained in moveable pistons or slide plates that enable the processor to remove the screens from the extruder flow without stopping production. The contaminants are usually collected on woven wire screens which are supported on a stainless steel plate called a ‘breaker plate’—a strong circular piece of steel drilled with large holes to allow the flow of the polymer melt. For the recycling of polyester it is typical to integrate a screen changer into the extrusion line. This can be in a pelletizing, sheet extrusion or strapping tape extrusion line.

==Drying polyester==
PET polymer is very sensitive to hydrolytic degradation, resulting in severe reduction in its molecular weight, thereby adversely affecting its subsequent melt processability. Therefore, it is essential to dry the PET flakes or granules to a very low moisture level prior to melt extrusion.

PET must be dried to &lt;100 parts per million (ppm) moisture and maintained at this moisture level to minimize hydrolysis during melt processing.&lt;ref&gt;http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/14/13543.pdf PET Drying Best Practices&lt;/ref&gt;

Dehumidifying Drying - These types of dryers circulate hot and de-humidified dry air onto the resin, suck the air back, dry it and then pump again in a closed loop operation. This process reduces moisture level in the PET down to 50ppm or lower. The efficiency of moisture removal depends on the air dew point. If the air dew point is not good, then some moisture remains in the chips and cause IV loss during processing.

[[File:IRD Drum.jpg|left|thumb|IRD drying drum used for the drying of Polyester pellets and polyester bottle flakes]]
Infrared Drying polyester pellets and flakes - A new type of dryer has been introduced in recent years, using Infrared drying (IRD). Due to the high rate of energy transfer with IR heating in combination with the specific wavelength used, the energy costs involved with these systems can be greatly reduced, along with the size. Polyester can be dried and amorphous flake crystallized and dried within only about 15 minutes down to a moisture level of approx. 300ppm in one step, and down to &lt;50 ppm using a buffer hopper to complete the drying in typically under 1 hour

== Global statistics ==
[[File:Profile Raincoat 100 percent Recycled PET fabric.jpg|thumb|Dog raincoat made from 100% recycled [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] fabric.]]

Worldwide, approximately 7.5 million tons of PET were collected in 2011.  This gave 5.9 million tons of flake.  In 2009 3.4 million tons were used to produce fibre, 500,000 tons to produce bottles, 500,000 tons to produce [[APET]] sheet for thermoforming, 200,000 tons to produce strapping tape and 100,000 tons for miscellaneous applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcipetpackaging.co.uk|title=- PCI Wood Mackenzie|website=PCI Wood Mackenzie|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petcore]], the European [[trade association]] that fosters the collection and recycling of PET, reported that in Europe alone, 1.6 million tonnes of PET bottles were collected in 2011 - more than 51% of all bottles.  After exported bales were taken into account, 1.12 million tons of PET flake were produced.  440,000 tons were used to produce fibres, 283,000 tons to produce more bottles, 278,000 tons to produce APET sheets, 102,000 tons for strapping tape and 18,000 tons for miscellaneous applications.  (Source: PCI for Petcore and EuPR)

In 2008 the amount of post-consumer PET bottles collected for recycling and sold in the United States was approx. 1.45 billion pounds.&lt;ref name=Dege&gt;Nicholas Dege: The Technology of bottled water, p. 431, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, {{ISBN|9781444393323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, 81% of the PET bottles sold in [[Switzerland]] were recycled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bafu.admin.ch/dokumentation/medieninformation/00962/index.html?lang=fr&amp;msg-id=50084 (page visited on 4 November 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing energy prices may increase the volume of recycling PET bottles.&lt;ref name=Dege/&gt; In Europe, the EU Waste Framework Directive mandates that by 2020 there should be 50% recycling or reuse of plastics from household streams.&lt;ref name=Dege/&gt;

In the United States the recycling rate for PET packaging was 31.2% in 2013, according to a report from The National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR) and The Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers (APR). A total of 1,798 million pounds was collected and 475 million pounds of recycled PET used out of a total of 5,764 million pounds of PET bottles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plasticstoday.com/articles/recycling-for-PET-packaging-reaches-31-percent-in-2013-141008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Re-use of PET bottles ==
PET bottles are also recycled as-is (re-used) for various purposes, including for use in school projects, and for use in [[solar water disinfection]] in [[developing nation]]s, in which empty PET bottles are filled with water and left in the sun to allow disinfection by [[ultraviolet radiation]].  PET is useful for this purpose because many other materials (including window glass) that are transparent to visible light are opaque to ultraviolet radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A novel use is as a building material in third-world countries. According to online sources, the bottles, in a labor-intensive process, are filled with sand, then stacked and either mudded or cemented together to form a wall. Some of the bottles can be filled instead with air or water, to admit light into the structure.

In '''passive solar building design''', windows, walls, and floors are made to collect, store, reflect, and distribute [[solar energy]] in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer. This is called passive solar design because, unlike active [[solar heating]] systems, it does not involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doerr |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Doerr |year=2012 |title=Passive Solar Simplified |edition=1st |url=http://alitheiapress.com/ |accessdate=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key to design a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local [[climate]] performing an accurate [[site analysis]]. Elements to be considered include window placement and size, and [[Glazing (window)|glazing]] type, [[thermal insulation]], [[thermal mass]], and shading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Brian|title=Harnessing Solar Heat|year=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-7275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, but existing buildings can be adapted or "retrofitted".

==Passive energy gain==
[[Image:Illust passive solar d1.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Elements of passive solar design, shown in a direct gain application]]
''Passive solar'' technologies use [[solar energy|sunlight]] without active mechanical systems (as contrasted to [[active solar]]). Such technologies convert sunlight into usable heat (in water, air, and thermal mass), cause air-movement for [[ventilating]], or future use, with little use of other energy sources. A common example is a [[sunroom#Solarium|solarium]] on the [[equator]]-side of a building. [[Passive cooling]] is the use of the same design principles to reduce summer cooling requirements.

Some passive systems use a small amount of conventional energy to control dampers, shutters, night insulation, and other devices that enhance solar energy collection, storage, and use, and reduce undesirable [[heat transfer]].

Passive solar technologies include direct and indirect [[solar gain]] for space heating, [[solar hot water|solar water heating]] systems based on the [[thermosiphon]], use of [[thermal mass]] and [[Phase Change Material|phase-change materials]] for slowing indoor air temperature swings, [[solar cooker]]s, the [[solar chimney]] for enhancing natural ventilation, and [[earth sheltering]].

More widely, passive solar technologies include the [[solar furnace]], but this typically requires some external energy for aligning their concentrating mirrors or receivers, and historically have not proven to be practical or cost effective for widespread use. 'Low-grade' energy needs, such as space and water heating, have proven over time to be better applications for passive use of solar energy.

==As a science==
The [[scientific]] basis for passive solar building design has been developed from a combination of [[climatology]], [[thermodynamics]] (particularly [[heat transfer]]: [[conduction (heat)]], [[convection]], and [[electromagnetic radiation]]), [[fluid mechanics]]/[[natural convection]] (passive movement of air and water without the use of electricity, fans or pumps), and human [[thermal comfort]] based on [[heat index]], [[psychrometrics]] and [[enthalpy]] control for buildings to be inhabited by humans or animals, [[sunroom]]s, solariums, and [[greenhouse]]s for raising plants.

Specific attention is divided into: the site, location and solar orientation of the building, local [[sun path]], the prevailing level of [[insolation]] ([[latitude]]/sunshine/clouds/[[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]), design and construction quality/materials, placement/size/type of windows and walls, and incorporation of solar-energy-storing [[thermal mass]] with [[heat capacity]].

While these considerations may be directed toward any building, achieving an ideal optimized cost/performance solution requires careful, [[holistic]], [[system integration]] [[engineering]] of these scientific principles. [[History of passive solar building design|Modern refinements]] through computer modeling (such as the comprehensive U.S. Department of Energy "Energy Plus"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = U.S. Department of Energy – Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy – Energy Plus Energy Simulation Software | url = http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/ | accessdate = 2011-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[building energy simulation]] software), and application of decades of lessons learned (since the 1970s energy crisis) can achieve significant energy savings and reduction of environmental damage, without sacrificing functionality or aesthetics.&lt;ref name=fs110&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, passive-solar design features such as a greenhouse/sunroom/solarium can greatly enhance the livability, daylight, views, and value of a home, at a low cost per unit of space.

Much has been learned about passive solar building design since the 1970s energy crisis. Many unscientific, intuition-based expensive construction experiments have attempted and failed to achieve [[zero energy building|zero energy]] – the total elimination of heating-and-cooling energy bills.

Passive solar building construction may not be difficult or expensive (using off-the-shelf existing materials and technology), but the scientific passive solar building design is a non-trivial engineering effort that requires significant study of previous counter-intuitive lessons learned, and time to enter, evaluate, and iteratively refine the [[building energy simulation|simulation]] input and output.

One of the most useful post-construction evaluation tools has been the use of [[thermography]] using digital [[Thermographic camera|thermal imaging cameras]] for a formal quantitative scientific [[energy audit]]. Thermal imaging can be used to document areas of poor thermal performance such as the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day.

The scientific lessons learned over the last three decades have been captured in sophisticated comprehensive [[building energy simulation]] computer software systems (like U.S. DOE Energy Plus).

Scientific passive solar building design with quantitative [[cost benefit]] [[product optimization]] is not easy for a novice. The level of complexity has resulted in ongoing bad-architecture, and many intuition-based, unscientific construction experiments that disappoint their designers and waste a significant portion of their construction budget on inappropriate ideas.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://occ.governee.cere.net/2013/08/passive-solar-design-in-architecture-new-trend/|title=Passive Solar Design in Architecture – New Trend?|last=Talamon|first=Attila|date=7 Aug 2013|website=Governee|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic motivation for scientific design and engineering is significant. If it had been applied comprehensively to new building construction beginning in 1980 (based on 1970s lessons learned), America could be saving over $250,000,000 per year on expensive energy and related pollution today.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since 1979, Passive Solar Building Design has been a critical element of achieving [[zero energy building|zero energy]] by educational institution experiments, and governments around the world, including the U.S. Department of Energy, and the energy research scientists that they have supported for decades. The [[cost effective]] [[proof of concept]] was established decades ago, but [[cultural assimilation]] into architecture, construction trades, and building-owner [[decision making]] has been very slow and difficult to change.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The new terms "Architectural Science" and "Architectural Technology" are being added to some schools of Architecture, with a future goal of teaching the above scientific and energy-engineering principles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==The solar path in passive design==

[[File:Solar altitude.svg|thumb|300px|Solar altitude over a year; latitude based on [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]]]

{{Main article|Sun path|Position of the Sun}}

The ability to achieve these goals simultaneously is fundamentally dependent on the seasonal variations in the sun's path throughout the day.

This occurs as a result of the [[inclination]] of the Earth's axis of rotation in relation to its [[orbit]]. The [[sun path]] is unique for any given latitude.

In Northern Hemisphere non-tropical latitudes farther than 23.5 degrees from the equator:

* The sun will reach its [[noon|highest point]] toward the south (in the direction of the equator)
* As winter [[solstice]] approaches, the [[azimuth|angle]] at which the sun [[sunrise|rises]] and [[sunset|sets]] progressively moves further toward the South and the daylight hours will become shorter
* The opposite is noted in summer where the sun will rise and set further toward the North and the daylight hours will lengthen&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srrb.noaa.gov/highlights/sunrise/fig5_40n.gif&lt;/ref&gt;

The converse is observed in the Southern Hemisphere, but the sun rises to the east and sets toward the west regardless of which hemisphere you are in.

In equatorial regions at less than 23.5 degrees, the position of the sun at [[noon|solar noon]] will oscillate from north to south and back again during the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srrb.noaa.gov/highlights/sunrise/fig5_0n.gif&lt;/ref&gt;

In regions closer than 23.5 degrees from either north-or-south pole, during summer the sun will trace a complete circle in the sky without setting whilst it will never appear above the horizon six months later, during the height of winter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srrb.noaa.gov/highlights/sunrise/fig5_90n.gif&lt;/ref&gt;

The 47-degree difference in the altitude of the sun at [[solar noon]] between winter and summer forms the basis of passive solar design. This information is combined with local climatic data ([[degree day]]) heating and cooling requirements to determine at what time of the year solar gain will be beneficial for [[thermal comfort]], and when it should be blocked with shading. By strategic placement of items such as glazing and shading devices, the percent of solar gain entering a building can be controlled throughout the year.

One [[passive solar]] sun path design problem is that although the sun is in the same relative position six weeks before, and six weeks after, the solstice, due to "thermal lag" from the [[thermal mass]] of the Earth, the temperature and solar gain requirements are quite different before and after the summer or winter solstice. Movable shutters, shades, shade screens, or window quilts can accommodate day-to-day and hour-to-hour solar gain and insulation requirements.

Careful arrangement of rooms completes the passive solar design. A common recommendation for residential dwellings is to place living areas facing solar noon and sleeping quarters on the opposite side.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109095540/http://www.yourhome.gov.au/technical/fs43.html|title=Your Home Technical Manual - 4.3 Orientation - Part 1|author=|date=9 November 2012|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[heliodon]] is a traditional movable light device used by architects and designers to help model sun path effects.

==Passive solar heat transfer principles==

Personal [[thermal comfort]] is a function of personal health factors (medical, psychological, sociological and situational), ambient air temperature, [[mean radiant temperature]], air movement ([[wind chill]], [[turbulence]]) and [[relative humidity]] (affecting human [[evaporation|evaporative]] cooling). [[Heat transfer]] in buildings occurs through [[convection]], [[Heat conduction|conduction]], and [[thermal radiation]] through roof, walls, floor and windows.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325024055/http://www.yourhome.gov.au/technical/fs47.html|title=Your Home Technical Manual - 4.7 Insulation|author=|date=25 March 2012|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convective heat transfer===
[[Convective heat transfer]] can be beneficial or detrimental. Uncontrolled air infiltration from poor [[weatherization]] / weatherstripping / draft-proofing can contribute up to 40% of heat loss during winter;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/whole_wall/airtight.html |title=BERC – Airtightness |publisher=Ornl.gov |date=2004-05-26 |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, strategic placement of operable windows or vents can enhance convection, cross-ventilation, and summer cooling when the outside air is of a comfortable temperature and [[relative humidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320202939/http://yourhome.gov.au/technical/fs46.html|title=Your Home Technical Manual - 4.6 Passive Cooling|author=|date=20 March 2012|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filtered [[energy recovery ventilation]] systems may be useful to eliminate undesirable humidity, dust, pollen, and microorganisms in unfiltered ventilation air.

Natural convection causing [[stack effect|rising]] warm air and falling cooler air can result in an uneven stratification of heat. This may cause uncomfortable variations in temperature in the upper and lower conditioned space, serve as a method of venting hot air, or be designed in as a natural-convection air-flow loop for [[passive solar]] heat distribution and temperature equalization.  Natural human cooling by [[perspiration]] and [[evaporation]] may be facilitated through natural or forced convective air movement by fans, but ceiling fans can disturb the stratified insulating air layers at the top of a room, and accelerate heat transfer from a hot attic, or through nearby windows. In addition, high [[relative humidity]] inhibits evaporative cooling by humans.

===Radiative heat transfer===
The main source of [[heat transfer]] is [[radiant energy]], and the primary source is the sun. Solar radiation occurs predominantly through the roof and windows (but also through walls). [[Thermal radiation]] moves from a warmer surface to a cooler one.  Roofs receive the majority of the solar radiation delivered to a house.  A [[cool roof]], or [[green roof]] in addition to a [[radiant barrier]] can help prevent your attic from becoming hotter than the peak summer outdoor air temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11680 |title=EERE Radiant Barriers |publisher=Eere.energy.gov |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[albedo]], [[Absorbance|absorptivity]], [[emissivity]], and [[reflectivity]]).

Windows are a ready and predictable site for [[thermal radiation]].&lt;ref name=fs18a&gt;{{cite web

Energy from radiation can move into a window in the day time, and out of the same window at night. Radiation uses [[photon]]s to transmit [[electromagnetic waves]] through a vacuum, or translucent medium. Solar heat gain can be significant even on cold clear days. Solar heat gain through windows can be reduced by [[insulated glazing]], shading, and orientation.  Windows are particularly difficult to insulate compared to roof and walls. [[Convective heat transfer]] through and around [[window covering]]s also degrade its insulation properties.&lt;ref name=fs18a/&gt;  When shading windows, external shading is more effective at reducing heat gain than internal [[window covering]]s.&lt;ref name=fs18a/&gt;

Western and eastern sun can provide warmth and lighting, but are vulnerable to overheating in summer if not shaded. In contrast, the low midday sun readily admits light and warmth during the winter, but can be easily shaded with appropriate length overhangs or angled louvres during summer and leaf bearing summer shade trees which shed their leaves in the fall.  The amount of radiant heat received is related to the location [[latitude]], [[altitude]], [[cloud cover]], and seasonal / hourly [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] (see [[Sun path]] and [[Lambert's cosine law]]).

Another passive solar design principle is that thermal energy can be [[Thermal mass|stored]] in certain building materials and released again when heat gain eases to stabilize [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] (day/night) temperature variations. The complex interaction of [[thermodynamic]] principles can be [[counterintuitive]] for first-time designers. Precise [[Building Information Modeling|computer modeling]] can help avoid costly construction experiments.

The precise amount of equator-facing glass and thermal mass should be based on careful consideration of latitude, altitude, climatic conditions, and heating/cooling [[degree day]] requirements.

Factors that can degrade thermal performance:

* Deviation from ideal orientation and north/south/east/west aspect ratio
* Excessive glass area ("over-glazing") resulting in overheating (also resulting in glare and fading of soft furnishings) and heat loss when ambient air temperatures fall
* Installing glazing where solar gain during the day and thermal losses during the night cannot be controlled easily e.g. West-facing, angled glazing, skylights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Introductory Passive Solar Energy Technology Overview | publisher = U.S. DOE – ORNL Passive Solar Workshop | url = http://www.passivesolarenergy.info/#S1 | accessdate = 2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Thermal losses through non-insulated or unprotected glazing
* Lack of adequate shading during seasonal periods of high solar gain (especially on the West wall)
* Incorrect application of [[thermal mass]] to modulate daily temperature variations
* Open staircases leading to unequal distribution of warm air between upper and lower floors as warm air rises
* High building surface area to volume – Too many corners
* Inadequate [[weatherization]] leading to high air infiltration
* Lack of, or incorrectly installed, [[radiant barrier]]s during the hot season. (See also [[cool roof]] and [[green roof]])
* [[Building insulation|Insulation materials]] that are not matched to the main mode of heat transfer (e.g. undesirable convective/conductive/radiant [[heat transfer]])

Technically, PSH is highly efficient. Direct-gain systems can utilize (i.e. convert into "useful" heat) 65–70% of the energy of solar radiation that strikes the aperture or collector.

Passive solar fraction (PSF) is the percentage of the required heat load met by PSH and hence represents potential reduction in heating costs. RETScreen International has reported a PSF of 20–50%. Within the field of [[sustainability]], energy conservation even of the order of 15% is considered substantial.

Other sources report the following PSFs:

*5–25% for modest systems
*40% for "highly optimized" systems
*Up to 75% for "very intense" systems

In favorable climates such as the southwest United States, highly optimized systems can exceed 75% PSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmsea.org/Passive_Solar/Passive_Solar_Design.htm |title=Passive Solar Design |publisher=New Mexico Solar Association |accessdate=2015-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201213855/http://www.nmsea.org/Passive_Solar/Passive_Solar_Design.htm |archivedate=2015-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key passive solar building configurations==
There are three primary passive solar energy configurations:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mechanical and Electrical Systems in Architecture, Engineering and Construction.|last=Wujek|first=Joseph|publisher=Pearson Education/Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=9780135000045|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*direct [[solar gain|solar system]]
*indirect solar system
*isolated solar system

===Direct solar system===
In a '''''direct-gain passive solar system''''', the indoor space acts as a solar collector, heat absorber, and distribution system. South-facing glass in the northern hemisphere(north-facing in the southern hemisphere) admits solar energy into the building interior where it directly heats (radiant energy absorption) or indirectly heats (through convection) thermal mass in the building such as concrete or masonry floors and walls. The floors and walls acting as thermal mass are incorporated as functional parts of the building and temper the intensity of heating during the day. At night, the heated thermal mass radiates heat into the indoor space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In cold climates, a '''''sun-tempered building''''' is the most basic type of direct gain passive solar configuration that simply involves increasing (slightly) the south-facing glazing area, without adding additional thermal mass. It is a type of direct-gain system in which the building envelope is well insulated, is elongated in an east–west direction, and has a large fraction (~80% or more) of the windows on the south side. It has little added thermal mass beyond what is already in the building (i.e., just framing, wall board, and so forth). In a sun-tempered building, the south-facing window area should be limited to about 5 to 7% of the total floor area, less in a sunny climate, to prevent overheating. Additional south-facing glazing can be included only if more thermal mass is added. Energy savings are modest with this system, and sun tempering is very low cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In genuine '''''direct gain passive solar systems''''', sufficient thermal mass is required to prevent large temperature fluctuations in indoor air; more thermal mass is required than in a sun tempered building. Overheating of the building interior can result with insufficient or poorly designed thermal mass. About one-half to two-thirds of the interior surface area of the floors, walls and ceilings must be constructed of thermal storage materials. Thermal storage materials can be concrete, adobe, brick, and water. Thermal mass in floors and walls should be kept as bare as is functionally and aesthetically possible; thermal mass needs to be exposed to direct sunlight. Wall-to-wall carpeting, large throw rugs, expansive furniture, and large wall hangings should be avoided.

Typically, for about every 1&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of south-facing glass, about 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of thermal mass is required for thermal mass (1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per 5 to 10 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). When accounting for minimal-to-average wall and floor coverings and furniture, this typically equates to about 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (5 to 10 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of south-facing glass, depending upon whether the sunlight strikes the surface directly. The simplest rule of thumb is that thermal mass area should have an area of 5 to 10 times the surface area of the direct-gain collector (glass) area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Solid thermal mass (e.g., concrete, masonry, stone, etc.) should be relatively thin, no more than about 4 in (100&amp;nbsp;mm) thick. Thermal masses with large exposed areas and those in direct sunlight for at least part of the day (2 hour minimum) perform best. Medium-to-dark, colors with high absorptivity, should be used on surfaces of thermal mass elements that will be in direct sunlight. Thermal mass that is not in contact with sunlight can be any color. Lightweight elements (e.g., drywall walls and ceilings) can be any color. Covering the glazing with tight-fitting, moveable insulation panels during dark, cloudy periods and nighttime hours will greatly enhance performance of a direct-gain system. Water contained within plastic or metal containment and placed in direct sunlight heats more rapidly and more evenly than solid mass due to natural convection heat transfer. The convection process also prevents surface temperatures from becoming too extreme as they sometimes do when dark colored solid mass surfaces receive direct sunlight.

Depending on climate and with adequate thermal mass, south-facing glass area in a direct gain system should be limited to about 10 to 20% of the floor area (e.g., 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of glass for a 100&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; floor area). This should be based on the net glass or glazing area. Note that most windows have a net glass/glazing area that is 75 to 85% of the overall window unit area. Above this level, problems with overheating, glare and fading of fabrics are likely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Indirect solar system===
In an '''''indirect-gain passive solar system''''', the thermal mass ([[concrete]], masonry, or water) is located directly behind the south-facing glass and in front of the heated indoor space and so there is no direct heating The position of the mass prevents sunlight from entering the indoor space and can also obstruct the view through the glass. There are two types of indirect gain systems: thermal storage wall systems and roof pond systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Thermal Storage (Trombe) Walls'''

In a '''''thermal storage wall''''' system, often called a '''''[[Trombe wall]]''''', a massive wall is located directly behind south-facing glass, which absorbs solar energy and releases it selectively towards the building interior at night. The wall can be constructed of cast-in-place concrete, brick, adobe, stone, or solid (or filled) concrete masonry units. Sunlight enters through the glass and is immediately absorbed at the surface of the mass wall and either stored or conducted through the material mass to the inside space. The thermal mass cannot absorb solar energy as fast as it enters the space between the mass and the window area. Temperatures of the air in this space can easily exceed 120&amp;nbsp;°F (49&amp;nbsp;°C). This hot air can be introduced into interior spaces behind the wall by incorporating heat-distributing vents at the top of the wall. This wall system was first envisioned and patented in 1881 by its inventor, Edward Morse. Felix Trombe, for whom this system is sometimes named, was a French engineer who built several homes using this design in the French Pyrenees in the 1960s.

A thermal storage wall typically consists of a 4 to 16 in (100 to 400&amp;nbsp;mm) thick masonry wall coated with a dark, heat-absorbing finish (or a selective surface) and covered with a single or double layer of high transmissivity glass. The glass is typically placed from ¾ in to 2 in from the wall to create a small airspace. In some designs, the mass is located 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;ft (0.6 m) away from the glass, but the space is still not usable. The surface of the thermal mass absorbs the solar radiation that strikes it and stores it for nighttime use. Unlike a direct gain system, the thermal storage wall system provides passive solar heating without excessive window area and glare in interior spaces. However, the ability to take advantage of views and daylighting are eliminated. The performance of Trombe walls is diminished if the wall interior is not open to the interior spaces. Furniture, bookshelves and wall cabinets installed on the interior surface of the wall will reduce its performance.

A classical '''''Trombe wall''''', also generically called a '''''vented thermal storage wall''''', has operable vents near the ceiling and floor levels of the mass wall that allow indoor air to flow through them by natural convection. As solar radiation heats the air trapped between the glass and wall and it begins to rise. Air is drawn into the lower vent, then into the space between the glass and wall to get heated by solar radiation, increasing its temperature and causing it to rise, and then exit through the top (ceiling) vent back into the indoor space. This allows the wall to directly introduce heated air into the space; usually at a temperature of about 90&amp;nbsp;°F (32&amp;nbsp;°C).

If vents are left open at night (or on cloudy days), a reversal of convective airflow will occur, wasting heat by dissipating it outdoors. Vents must be closed at night so radiant heat from the interior surface of the storage wall heats the indoor space. Generally, vents are also closed during summer months when heat gain is not needed. During the summer, an exterior exhaust vent installed at the top of the wall can be opened to vent to the outside. Such venting makes the system act as a solar chimney driving air through the building during the day.

Vented thermal storage walls vented to the interior have proven somewhat ineffective, mostly because they deliver too much heat during the day in mild weather and during summer months; they simply overheat and create comfort issues. Most solar experts recommended that thermal storage walls should not be vented to the interior.

There are many variations of the Trombe wall system. An '''''unvented thermal storage wall''''' (technically not a Trombe wall) captures solar energy on the exterior surface, heats up, and conducts heat to the interior surface, where it radiates from the interior wall surface to the indoor space later in the day. A '''''water wall''''' uses a type of thermal mass that consists of tanks or tubes of water used as thermal mass.

A typical unvented thermal storage wall consists of a south facing masonry or concrete wall with a dark, heat-absorbing material on the exterior surface and faced with a single or double layer of glass. High transmission glass maximizes solar gains to the mass wall. The glass is placed from ¾ to 6 in. (20 to 150&amp;nbsp;mm) from the wall to create a small airspace. Glass framing is typically metal (e.g., aluminum) because vinyl will soften and wood will become super dried at the 180&amp;nbsp;°F (82&amp;nbsp;°C) temperature that can exist behind the glass in the wall. Heat from sunlight passing through the glass is absorbed by the dark surface, stored in the wall, and conducted slowly inward through the masonry. As an architectural detail, patterned glass can limit the exterior visibility of the wall without sacrificing solar transmissivity.

A water wall uses containers of water for thermal mass instead of a solid mass wall. Water walls are typically slightly more efficient than solid mass walls because they absorb heat more efficiently due to the development of convective currents in the liquid water as it is heated. These currents cause rapid mixing and quicker transfer of heat into the building than can be provided by the solid mass walls.

Temperature variations between the exterior and interior wall surfaces drive heat through the mass wall. Inside the building, however, daytime heat gain is delayed, only becoming available at the interior surface of the thermal mass during the evening when it is needed because the sun has set. The time lag is the time difference between when sunlight first strikes the wall and when the heat enters the building interior. Time lag is contingent upon the type of material used in the wall and the wall thickness; a greater thickness yields a greater time lag. The time lag characteristic of thermal mass, combined with dampening of temperature fluctuations, allows the use of varying daytime solar energy as a more uniform night-time heat source. Windows can be placed in the wall for natural lighting or aesthetic reasons, but this tends to lower the efficiency somewhat.

The thickness of a thermal storage wall should be approximately 10 to 14 in (250 to 350&amp;nbsp;mm) for brick, 12 to 18 in (300 to 450&amp;nbsp;mm) for concrete, 8 to 12 in (200 to 300&amp;nbsp;mm) for earth/adobe, and at least 6 in (150&amp;nbsp;mm) for water. These thicknesses delay movement of heat such that indoor surface temperatures peak during late evening hours. Heat will take about 8 to 10 hours to reach the interior of the building (heat travels through a concrete wall at rate of about one inch per hour). A good thermal connection between the inside wall finishes (e.g., drywall) and the thermal mass wall is necessary to maximize heat transfer to the interior space.

Although the position of a thermal storage wall minimizes daytime overheating of the indoor space, a well-insulated building should be limited to approximately 0.2 to 0.3&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of thermal mass wall surface per ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor area being heated (0.2 to 0.3 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor area), depending upon climate. A water wall should have about 0.15 to 0.2&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of water wall surface per ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.15 to 0.2 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of floor area.

Thermal mass walls are best-suited to sunny winter climates that have high diurnal (day-night) temperature swings (e.g., southwest, mountain-west). They do not perform as well in cloudy or extremely cold climates or in climates where there is not a large diurnal temperature swing. Nighttime thermal losses through the thermal mass of the wall can still be significant in cloudy and cold climates; the wall loses stored heat in less than a day, and then leak heat, which dramatically raises backup heating requirements. Covering the glazing with tight-fitting, moveable insulation panels during lengthy cloudy periods and nighttime hours will enhance performance of a thermal storage system.

The main drawback of thermal storage walls is their heat loss to the outside. Double glass (glass or any of the plastics) is necessary for reducing heat loss in most climates. In mild climates, single glass is acceptable. A selective surface (high-absorbing/low-emitting surface) applied to the exterior surface of the thermal storage wall improves performance by reducing the amount of infrared energy radiated back through the glass; typically, it achieves a similar improvement in performance without the need for daily installation and removal of insulating panels. A selective surface consists of a sheet of metal foil glued to the outside surface of the wall. It absorbs almost all the radiation in the visible portion of the solar spectrum and emits very little in the infrared range. High absorbency turns the light into heat at the wall's surface, and low emittance prevents the heat from radiating back towards the glass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Roof Pond System'''

A '''''roof pond'' ''passive solar system''''', sometimes called a '''''solar roof''''', uses water stored on the roof to temper hot and cold internal temperatures, usually in desert environments. It typically is constructed of containers holding 6 to 12 in (150 to 300&amp;nbsp;mm) of water on a flat roof. Water is stored in large plastic bags or fiberglass containers to maximize radiant emissions and minimize evaporation. It can be left unglazed or can be covered by glazing. Solar radiation heats the water, which acts as a thermal storage medium. At night or during cloudy weather, the containers can be covered with insulating panels. The indoor space below the roof pond is heated by thermal energy emitted by the roof pond storage above. These systems require good drainage systems, movable insulation, and an enhanced structural system to support a 35 to 70&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1.7 to 3.3&amp;nbsp;kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) dead load.

With the angles of incidence of sunlight during the day, roof ponds are only effective for heating at lower and mid-latitudes, in hot to temperate climates. Roof pond systems perform better for cooling in hot, low humidity climates. Not many solar roofs have been built, and there is limited information on the design, cost, performance, and construction details of thermal storage roofs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Isolated solar system===
In an '''''isolated gain passive solar system''','' the components (e.g., collector and thermal storage) are isolated from the indoor area of the building.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An '''''attached sunspace''''', also sometimes called a '''''solar room''''' or '''''solarium''''', is a type of isolated gain solar system with a glazed interior space or room that is part of or attached to a building but which can be completely closed off from the main occupied areas. It functions like an attached greenhouse that makes use of a combination of direct-gain and indirect-gain system characteristics. A sunspace may be called and appear like a greenhouse, but a greenhouse is designed to grow plants whereas a sunspace is designed to provide heat and aesthetics to a building. Sunspaces are very popular passive design elements because they expand the living areas of a building and offer a room to grow plants and other vegetation. In moderate and cold climates, however, supplemental space heating is required to keep plants from freezing during extremely cold weather.

An attached sunspace’s south-facing glass collects solar energy as in a direct-gain system. The simplest sunspace design is to install vertical windows with no overhead glazing. Sunspaces may experience high heat gain and high heat loss through their abundance of glazing. Although horizontal and sloped glazing collects more heat in the winter, it is minimized to prevent overheating during summer months. Although overhead glazing can be aesthetically pleasing, an insulated roof provides better thermal performance. Skylights can be used to provide some daylighting potential. Vertical glazing can maximize gain in winter, when the angle of the sun is low, and yield less heat gain during the summer. Vertical glass is less expensive, easier to install and insulate, and not as prone to leaking, fogging, breaking, and other glass failures. A combination of vertical glazing and some sloped glazing is acceptable if summer shading is provided. A well-designed overhang may be all that is necessary to shade the glazing in the summer.

The temperature variations caused by the heat losses and gains can be moderated by thermal mass and low-emissivity windows. Thermal mass can include a masonry floor, a masonry wall bordering the house, or water containers. Distribution of heat to the building can be accomplished through ceiling and floor level vents, windows, doors, or fans. In a common design, thermal mass wall situated on the back of the sunspace adjacent to the living space will function like an indirect-gain thermal mass wall. Solar energy entering the sunspace is retained in the thermal mass. Solar heat is conveyed into the building by conduction through the shared mass wall in the rear of the sunspace and by vents (like an unvented thermal storage wall) or through openings in the wall that permit airflow from the sunspace to the indoor space by convection (like a vented thermal storage wall).

In cold climates, double glazing should be used to reduce conductive losses through the glass to the outside. Night-time heat loss, although significant during winter months, is not as essential in the sunspace as with direct gain systems since the sunspace can be closed off from the rest of the building. In temperate and cold climates, thermally isolating the sunspace from the building at night is important. Large glass panels, French doors, or sliding glass doors between the building and attached sunspace will maintain an open feeling without the heat loss associated with an open space.

A sunspace with a masonry thermal wall will need approximately 0.3&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of thermal mass wall surface per ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor area being heated (0.3 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor area), depending on climate. Wall thicknesses should be similar to a thermal storage wall. If a water wall is used between the sunspace and living space, about 0.20&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of thermal mass wall surface per ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor area being heated (0.2 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor area) is appropriate. In most climates, a ventilation system is required in summer months to prevent overheating. Generally, vast overhead (horizontal) and east- and west-facing glass areas should not be used in a sunspace without special precautions for summer overheating such as using heat-reflecting glass and providing summer-shading systems areas.

The internal surfaces of the thermal mass should be dark in color. Movable insulation (e.g., window coverings, shades, shutters) can be used help trap the warm air in the sunspace both after the sun has set and during cloudy weather. When closed during extremely hot days, window coverings can help keep the sunspace from overheating.

To maximize comfort and efficiency, the non-glass sunspace walls, ceiling and foundation should be well insulated. The perimeter of the foundation wall or slab should be insulated to the frost line or around the slab perimeter. In a temperate or cold climate, the east and west walls of the sunspace should be insulated (no glass).

==Additional measures==
Measures should be taken to reduce heat loss at night e.g. window coverings or movable window insulation.

===Heat storage===
The sun doesn't shine all the time.  Heat storage, or [[thermal mass]], keeps the building warm when the sun can't heat it.

In diurnal solar houses, the storage is designed for one or a few days.  The usual method is a custom-constructed thermal mass. This includes a [[Trombe wall]], a ventilated concrete floor, a cistern, water wall or roof pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=Ayyoob|last2=Yamagata|first2=Yoshiki|title=Roof ponds as passive heating and cooling systems: A systematic review|journal=Applied Energy|date=December 2015|volume=160|pages=336–357|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.09.061}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also feasible to use the thermal mass of the earth itself, either as-is or by incorporation into the structure by banking or using rammed earth as a structural medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthship.com/|title=Earthships|author=|date=|website=earthship.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subarctic areas, or areas that have long terms without solar gain (e.g. weeks of freezing fog), purpose-built thermal mass is very expensive.  Don Stephens pioneered an experimental technique to use the ground as thermal mass large enough for annualized heat storage.  His designs run an isolated thermosiphon 3&amp;nbsp;m under a house, and insulate the ground with a 6&amp;nbsp;m waterproof skirt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenershelter.org/TokyoPaper.pdf Annualized Geo-Solar Heating, Don Stephens]- Accessed 2009-02-05&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insulation===
{{Main article| Building insulation}}
[[Thermal insulation]] or [[superinsulation]] (type, placement and amount) reduces unwanted leakage of heat.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;  Some passive buildings are actually [[Straw bale construction|constructed of insulation]].

===Special glazing systems and window coverings===

{{Main article|Insulated glazing|Window covering}}

The effectiveness of direct [[solar gain]] systems is significantly enhanced by insulative (e.g. [[double glazing]]), spectrally selective glazing ([[low-emissivity|low-e]]), or movable window insulation (window quilts, bifold interior insulation shutters, shades, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermal Shutters &amp; Shades – Over 100 Schemes for Reducing Heat Loss through Windows 1980 | author=[[William Shurcliff|Shurcliff, William A.]]|isbn=0-931790-14-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, Equator-facing windows should not employ glazing coatings that inhibit solar gain.

There is extensive use of super-insulated windows in the [[Germany|German]] [[Passive House]] standard. Selection of different spectrally selective window coating depends on the ratio of heating versus cooling [[degree day]]s for the design location.

===Glazing selection===

====Equator-facing glass====
The requirement for vertical equator-facing glass is different from the other three sides of a building. [[Insulated glazing|Reflective window coatings]] and multiple panes of glass can reduce useful solar gain. However, direct-gain systems are more dependent on [[Insulated glazing|double or triple glazing]] to reduce heat loss. Indirect-gain and isolated-gain configurations may still be able to function effectively with only single-pane glazing. Nevertheless, the optimal cost-effective solution is both location and system dependent.

====Roof-angle glass and skylights====

Skylights admit harsh direct overhead sunlight and glare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Florida Solar Energy Center – Skylights | url = http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/buildings/homes/windows/skylights.htm | accessdate = 2011-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; either horizontally (a flat roof) or pitched at the same angle as the roof slope. In some cases, horizontal skylights are used with reflectors to increase the intensity of solar radiation (and harsh glare), depending on the roof [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. When the winter sun is low on the horizon, most solar radiation reflects off of roof angled glass ( the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] is nearly parallel to roof-angled glass morning and afternoon ). When the summer sun is high, it is nearly perpendicular to roof-angled glass, which maximizes solar gain at the wrong time of year, and acts like a solar furnace. Skylights should be covered and well-insulated to reduce [[natural convection]] ( warm air rising ) heat loss on cold winter nights, and intense solar heat gain during hot spring/summer/fall days.

The equator-facing side of a building is south in the northern hemisphere, and north in the southern hemisphere. Skylights on roofs that face away from the equator provide mostly indirect illumination, except for summer days when the sun may rise on the non-equator side of the building (at some [[latitudes]]). Skylights on east-facing roofs provide maximum direct light and solar heat gain in the summer morning. West-facing skylights provide afternoon sunlight and heat gain during the hottest part of the day.

Some skylights have expensive glazing that partially reduces summer solar heat gain, while still allowing some visible light transmission. However, if visible light can pass through it, so can some radiant heat gain (they are both [[electromagnetic radiation]] waves).

You can partially reduce some of the unwanted roof-angled-glazing summer solar heat gain by installing a skylight in the shade of [[deciduous]] (leaf-shedding) trees, or by adding a movable insulated opaque window covering on the inside or outside of the skylight. This would eliminate the daylight benefit in the summer. If tree limbs hang over a roof, they will increase problems with leaves in rain gutters, possibly cause roof-damaging [[Ice dam (roof)|ice dams]], shorten roof life, and provide an easier path for pests to enter your attic. Leaves and twigs on skylights are unappealing, difficult to clean, and can increase the glazing breakage risk in wind storms.

"Sawtooth roof glazing" with vertical-glass-only can bring some of the passive solar building design benefits into the core of a commercial or industrial building, without the need for any roof-angled glass or skylights.

Skylights provide daylight. The only view they provide is essentially straight up in most applications. Well-insulated [[light tube]]s can bring daylight into northern rooms, without using a skylight. A passive-solar greenhouse provides abundant daylight for the equator-side of the building.

Infrared [[thermography]] color thermal imaging cameras ( used in formal [[energy audit]]s ) can quickly document the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day.

The U.S. Department of Energy states: "vertical glazing is the overall best option for sunspaces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = U.S. Department of Energy – Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy – Sunspace Orientation and Glazing Angles | url = http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/designing_remodeling/index.cfm/mytopic=10320 | accessdate = 2011-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roof-angled glass and sidewall glass are not recommended for passive solar sunspaces.

The U.S. DOE explains drawbacks to roof-angled glazing: Glass and plastic have little structural strength. When installed vertically, glass (or plastic) bears its own weight because only a small area (the top edge of the glazing) is subject to gravity. As the glass tilts off the vertical axis, however, an increased area (now the sloped cross-section) of the glazing has to bear the force of gravity. Glass is also brittle; it does not flex much before breaking. To counteract this, you usually must increase the thickness of the glazing or increase the number of structural supports to hold the glazing. Both increase overall cost, and the latter will reduce the amount of solar gain into the sunspace.

Another common problem with sloped glazing is its increased exposure to the weather. It is difficult to maintain a good seal on roof-angled glass in intense sunlight. Hail, sleet, snow, and wind may cause material failure. For occupant safety, regulatory agencies usually require sloped glass to be made of safety glass, laminated, or a combination thereof, which reduce solar gain potential. Most of the roof-angled glass on the Crowne Plaza Hotel Orlando Airport sunspace was destroyed in a single windstorm. Roof-angled glass increases construction cost, and can increase insurance premiums. Vertical glass is less susceptible to weather damage than roof-angled glass.

It is difficult to control solar heat gain in a sunspace with sloped glazing during the summer and even during the middle of a mild and sunny winter day. Skylights are the antithesis of [[zero energy building]] Passive Solar Cooling in climates with an air conditioning requirement.

====Angle of incident radiation====

The amount of solar gain transmitted through glass is also affected by the angle of the incident [[solar radiation]]. [[Sunlight]] striking a single sheet of glass within 45 degrees of [[perpendicular]] is mostly transmitted (less than 10% is [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]]), whereas for sunlight striking at 70 degrees from perpendicular over 20% of light is reflected, and above 70 degrees this percentage reflected rises sharply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/cbd/cbd039_e.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321191136/http://irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/pubs/cbd/cbd039_e.html|archivedate=2009-03-21 |title=Solar Heat Gain Through Glass |publisher=Irc.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these factors can be modeled more precisely with a photographic [[light meter]] and a [[heliodon]] or [[optical bench]], which can quantify the ratio of [[reflectivity]] to [[Transmittance|transmissivity]], based on [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]].

Alternatively, [[passive solar]] computer software can determine the impact of [[sun path]], and cooling-and-heating [[degree day]]s on [[energy]] performance.

===Operable shading and insulation devices===
A design with too much equator-facing glass can result in excessive winter, spring, or fall day heating, uncomfortably bright living spaces at certain times of the year, and excessive heat transfer on winter nights and summer days.

Although the sun is at the same altitude 6-weeks before and after the solstice, the heating and cooling requirements before and after the solstice are significantly different. Heat storage on the Earth's surface causes "thermal lag." Variable cloud cover influences solar gain potential. This means that latitude-specific fixed window overhangs, while important, are not a complete seasonal solar gain control solution.

Control mechanisms (such as manual-or-motorized interior insulated drapes, shutters, exterior roll-down shade screens, or retractable awnings) can compensate for differences caused by thermal lag or cloud cover, and help control daily / hourly solar gain requirement variations.
&lt;!--
[[File:Retractable shade.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Manually retractable shade sail in Australia]]
--&gt;

[[Home automation]] systems that monitor temperature, sunlight, time of day, and room occupancy can precisely control motorized window-shading-and-insulation devices.

===Exterior colors reflecting – absorbing===
Materials and colors can be chosen to reflect or absorb [[solar thermal energy]]. Using information on a [[Color]] for [[electromagnetic radiation]] to determine its [[thermal radiation]] properties of reflection or absorption can assist the choices.&lt;br&gt;See [http://www.energy.ca.gov/2006publications/CEC-500-2006-067/CEC-500-2006-067.PDF Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory: '''"Cool Colors"''']

==Landscaping and gardens==
{{Main article|Energy-efficient landscaping}}
[[Energy-efficient landscaping]] materials for careful passive solar choices include [[hardscape]] building material and "[[softscape]]" [[plant]]s. The use of [[landscape design]] principles for selection of [[trees]], [[hedge (barrier)|hedge]]s, and [[trellis (agriculture)|trellis]]-[[pergola]] features with [[vine]]s; all can be used to create summer shading. For winter solar gain it is desirable to use [[deciduous]] plants that drop their leaves in the autumn gives year round passive solar benefits. Non-deciduous [[evergreen]] [[shrub]]s and trees can be [[windbreak]]s, at variable heights and distances, to create protection and shelter from winter [[wind chill]]. [[Xeriscaping]] with 'mature size appropriate' [[Native plant|native species]] of-and [[Drought tolerance|drought tolerant plants]], [[drip irrigation]], mulching, and [[organic gardening]] practices reduce or eliminate the need for energy-and-water-intensive [[irrigation]], gas powered garden equipment, and reduces the landfill waste footprint. Solar powered [[landscape lighting]] and fountain pumps, and covered [[swimming pool]]s and [[plunge pool]]s with [[Solar water heating|solar water heaters]] can reduce the impact of such amenities.

==Other passive solar principles==

===Passive solar lighting===
{{Main article|Passive solar lighting}}
[[Passive solar lighting]] techniques enhance taking advantage of [[Sunlight|natural]] [[Daylighting|illumination]] for interiors, and so reduce reliance on artificial lighting systems.

This can be achieved by careful building design, orientation, and placement of window sections to collect light. Other creative solutions involve the use of reflecting surfaces to admit daylight into the interior of a building. Window sections should be adequately sized, and to avoid [[over-illumination]] can be shielded with a [[Brise soleil]], [[awning]]s, well placed trees, glass coatings, and other passive and active devices.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Chiras, D. The Solar House: Passive Heating and Cooling. Chelsea Green Publishing Company; 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major issue for many [[window]] systems is that they can be potentially vulnerable sites of excessive thermal gain or heat loss. Whilst high mounted [[clerestory]] window and traditional [[skylight (window)|skylight]]s can introduce daylight in poorly oriented sections of a building, unwanted heat transfer may be hard to control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Environmentandgreenerliving/Greenerhome/DG_064374 |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; Insulating and heating your home efficiently : Directgov – Environment and greener living |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allwoodwork.com/article/homeimprovement/reduce_your_heating_bills.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917055254/http://allwoodwork.com/article/homeimprovement/reduce_your_heating_bills.html|archivedate=2010-09-17 |title=Reduce Your Heating Bills This Winter – Overlooked Sources of Heat Loss in the Home |publisher=Allwoodwork.com |date=2003-02-14 |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, energy that is saved by reducing artificial lighting is often more than offset by the energy required for operating [[HVAC]] systems to maintain [[thermal comfort]].

Various methods can be employed to address this including but not limited to [[window covering]]s, [[insulated glazing]] and novel materials such as [[aerogel]] semi-transparent insulation, [[optical fiber]] embedded in walls or roof, or [https://web.archive.org/web/20130701184144/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/solar/ hybrid solar lighting at Oak Ridge National Laboratory].

Reflecting elements, from active and [[passive daylighting]] collectors, such as [[light shelves]], lighter wall and floor colors, [[mirror]]ed wall sections, interior walls with upper glass panels, and clear or translucent glassed hinged [[door]]s and [[sliding glass door]]s take the captured light and passively reflect it further inside. The light can be from passive windows or skylights and solar [[light tube]]s or from [[active daylighting]] sources. In traditional [[Japanese architecture]] the [[Shōji]] sliding panel doors, with translucent [[Washi]] screens, are an original precedent. [[International Style (architecture)|International style]], [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] and [[Mid-century modern]] [[architecture]] were earlier innovators of this passive penetration and reflection in industrial, commercial, and residential applications.

===Passive solar water heating===
{{Main article|Solar hot water}}

There are many ways to use [[solar thermal energy]] to heat water for domestic use. Different active-and-passive [[solar hot water]] technologies have different location-specific economic [[cost benefit analysis]] implications.

Fundamental passive solar hot water heating involves no pumps or anything electrical. It is very cost effective in climates that do not have lengthy sub-freezing, or very-cloudy, weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Norton (2011) Solar Water Heaters: A Review of Systems Research and Design Innovation, Green. 1, 189–206, ISSN (Online) 1869-8778&lt;/ref&gt; Other active solar water heating technologies, etc. may be more appropriate for some locations.

It is possible to have active solar hot water which is also capable of being "off grid" and qualifies as sustainable. This is done by the use of a photovoltaic cell which uses energy from the sun to power the pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://martinandrade.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/passive-solar-energy-my-edit.pdf|title=Solar Energy Home Design|last=Andrade|first=Martin|date=6 March 2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to the Passive House standard in Europe==
{{Main article|Passive house}}

There is growing momentum in Europe for the approach espoused by the [[passive house|Passive House]] (''Passivhaus'' in German) Institute in Germany. Rather than relying solely on traditional passive solar design techniques, this approach seeks to make use of all passive sources of heat, minimises energy usage, and emphasises the need for high levels of insulation reinforced by meticulous attention to detail in order to address thermal bridging and cold air infiltration. Most of the buildings built to the Passive House standard also incorporate an active [[heat recovery ventilation]] unit with or without a small (typically 1&amp;nbsp;kW) incorporated heating component.

The energy design of Passive House buildings is developed using a spreadsheet-based modeling tool called the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) which is updated periodically. The current version is PHPP2007, where 2007 is the year of issue. A building may be certified as a "Passive House" when it can be shown that it meets certain criteria, the most important being that the annual specific heat demand for the house should not exceed 15kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;a.

==Design tools==

Traditionally a [[heliodon]] was used to simulate the altitude and azimuth of the sun shining on a model building at any time of any day of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heliodon.com.mx/productos/heliodon/gal/helio_u_c_colon.JPG |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318232122/http://www.heliodon.com.mx/productos/heliodon/gal/helio_u_c_colon.JPG |archivedate=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, computer programs can model this phenomenon and integrate local climate data (including site impacts such as [[shadow|overshadowing]] and physical obstructions) to predict the solar gain potential for a particular building design over the course of a year. [[GPS]]-based [[smartphone]] applications can now do this inexpensively on a hand held device. These [[design tool]]s provide the passive solar designer the ability to evaluate local conditions, design elements and orientation prior to construction. Energy performance optimization normally requires an iterative-refinement design-and-evaluate process. There is no such thing as a "one-size-fits-all" universal passive solar building design that would work well in all locations.

==Levels of application==

Many detached suburban houses can achieve reductions in heating expense without obvious changes to their appearance, comfort or usability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/de/passive_solar_design.html |title=Industrial Technologies Program: Industrial Distributed Energy |publisher=Eere.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is done using good siting and window positioning, small amounts of thermal mass, with good-but-conventional insulation, weatherization, and an occasional supplementary heat source, such as a central radiator connected to a (solar) water heater. Sunrays may fall on a wall during the daytime and raise the temperature of its [[thermal mass]]. This will then [[Thermal radiation|radiate]] heat into the building in the evening. External shading, or a radiant barrier plus air gap, may be used to reduce undesirable summer solar gain.

An extension of the "passive solar" approach to seasonal solar capture and storage of heat and cooling. These designs attempt to capture warm-season solar heat, and convey it to a [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|seasonal thermal store]] for use months later during the cold season ("annualised passive solar.")  Increased storage is achieved by employing large amounts of thermal mass or [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger|earth coupling]]. Anecdotal reports suggest they can be effective but no formal study has been conducted to demonstrate their superiority. The approach also can move cooling into the warm season. Examples:

* [[Passive Annual Heat Storage]] (PAHS) – by John Hait
* [[Annualized Geothermal Solar]] (AGS) heating – by Don Stephen
* [[Earth sheltering|Earthed-roof]]

A "purely passive" solar-heated house would have no mechanical furnace unit, relying instead on energy captured from sunshine, only supplemented by "incidental" heat energy given off by lights, computers, and other task-specific appliances (such as those for cooking, entertainment, etc.), showering, people and pets. The use of natural convection air currents (rather than mechanical devices such as fans) to circulate air is related, though not strictly solar design. Passive solar building design sometimes uses limited electrical and mechanical controls to operate dampers, insulating shutters, shades, awnings, or reflectors. Some systems enlist small fans or solar-heated chimneys to improve convective air-flow. A reasonable way to analyse these systems is by measuring their [[coefficient of performance]]. A heat pump might use 1 J for every 4 J it delivers giving a COP of 4. A system that only uses a 30 W fan to more-evenly distribute 10&amp;nbsp;kW of solar heat through an entire house would have a COP of 300.

Passive solar building design is often a foundational element of a cost-effective [[zero energy building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39678.pdf |title=Cold-Climate Case Study for Affordable Zero Energy Homes: Preprint |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toolbase.org/PDF/CaseStudies/ZEHPrimer.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813130840/http://www.toolbase.org/PDF/CaseStudies/ZEHPrimer.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-08-13 |title=Zero Energy Homes: A Brief Primer |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a ZEB uses multiple passive solar building design concepts, a ZEB is usually not purely passive, having active mechanical renewable energy generation systems such as: [[wind turbine]], [[photovoltaics]], [[micro hydro]], [[geothermal]], and other emerging alternative energy sources.

===Passive solar design on skyscrapers===
There has been recent interest in the utilization of the large amounts of surface area on skyscrapers to improve their overall energy efficiency. Because skyscrapers are  increasingly ubiquitous in urban environments, yet require large amounts of energy to operate, there is potential for large amounts of energy savings employing passive solar design techniques. One study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lotfabadi|first=Pooya|title=Solar considerations in high-rise buildings|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271226417_Solar_Considerations_in_High-rise_Buildings|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=89|pages=183–195|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.12.044}}&lt;/ref&gt; which analyzed the proposed [[22 Bishopsgate]] tower in London, found that a 35% energy decrease in demand can theoretically  be achieved through indirect solar gains, by rotating the building to achieve optimum ventilation and daylight penetration, usage of high thermal mass flooring material to decrease temperature fluctuation inside the building, and using double or triple glazed low emissivity window glass for direct solar gain. Indirect solar gain techniques included moderating wall heat flow by variations of wall thickness (from 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm), using [[Glazing (window)|window glazing]] on the outdoor space to prevent heat loss, dedicating 15–20% of floor area for thermal storage, and implementing a [[Trombe wall]] to absorb heat entering the space. Overhangs are used to block direct sunlight in the summer, and allow it in the winter, and heat reflecting blinds are inserted between the thermal wall and the glazing to limit heat build-up in the summer months.

Another study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Irene|last2=Baldwin|first2=Andrew N.|date=2016-02-15|title=Investigating the potential of applying vertical green walls to high-rise residential buildings for energy-saving in sub-tropical region|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132315301906|journal=Building and Environment|volume=97|pages=34–39|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.11.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed double-green skin facade (DGSF) on the outside of high rise buildings in Hong Kong.  Such a green facade, or vegetation covering the outer walls, can combat the usage of air conditioning greatly - as much as 80%, as discovered by the researchers.

In more temperate climates, strategies such as glazing, adjustment of window-to-wall ratio, sun shading and roof strategies can offer considerable energy savings, in the 30% to 60% range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raji|first=Babak|last2=Tenpierik|first2=Martin J.|last3=van den Dobbelsteen|first3=Andy|title=An assessment of energy-saving solutions for the envelope design of high-rise buildings in temperate climates: A case study in the Netherlands|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778815303637|journal=Energy and Buildings|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.10.049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''photon''' is a type of [[elementary particle]], the [[quantum]] of the [[electromagnetic field]] including [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[light]], and the [[force carrier]] for the [[electromagnetic force]] (even when [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|static]] via [[virtual particle]]s). The photon has zero [[rest mass]] and always moves at the [[speed of light]] within a [[vacuum]].

Like all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by [[quantum mechanics]] and exhibit [[wave–particle duality]], exhibiting properties of both [[wave]]s and [[wikt:particle|particles]]. For example, a single photon may be [[refraction|refracted]] by a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and exhibit [[Interference (wave propagation)|wave interference]] with itself, and it can behave as a particle with definite and finite measurable position or [[momentum]], though not both at the same time.  The photon's wave and quantum qualities are two observable aspects of a single phenomenon – they cannot be described by any mechanical model;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joos|first1=George|title=Theoretical Physics|date=1951|publisher=Blackie and Son Limited|location=London and Glasgow|page=679}}&lt;/ref&gt; a representation of this dual property of light that assumes certain points on the wavefront to be the seat of the energy is not possible. The quanta in a light wave are not spatially localized. 

The modern concept of the photon was developed gradually by [[Albert Einstein]] in the early 20th century to explain experimental observations that did not fit the classical [[electromagnetic wave equation|wave model]] of light. The benefit of the photon model is that it accounts for the frequency dependence of light's energy, and explains the ability of [[matter]] and electromagnetic radiation to be in [[thermal equilibrium]]. The photon model accounts for anomalous observations, including the properties of [[black-body radiation]], that others (notably [[Max Planck]]) had tried to explain using ''semiclassical models''. In that model, light is described by [[Maxwell's equations]], but material objects emit and absorb light in ''quantized'' amounts (i.e., they change energy only by certain particular discrete amounts). Although these semiclassical models contributed to the development of quantum mechanics, many further experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kimble|first=H.J.|last2=Dagenais|first2=M.|last3=Mandel|first3=L.|year=1977|title=Photon Anti-bunching in Resonance Fluorescence|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=39|pages=691–695|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.39.691|bibcode=1977PhRvL..39..691K|issue=11}}

In the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]], photons and other elementary particles are described as a necessary consequence of physical laws having a certain [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] at every point in [[spacetime]]. The intrinsic properties of particles, such as [[electric charge|charge]], [[invariant mass|mass]], and [[spin (physics)|spin]], are determined by this [[gauge theory|gauge symmetry]].  The photon concept has led to momentous advances in experimental and theoretical physics, including [[laser]]s, [[Bose–Einstein condensation]], [[quantum field theory]], and the [[probability amplitude|probabilistic interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. It has been applied to [[photochemistry]], [[two-photon excitation microscopy|high-resolution microscopy]], and [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer|measurements of molecular distances]]. Recently, photons have been studied as elements of [[quantum computer]]s, and for applications in [[optical imaging]] and [[optical communication]] such as [[quantum cryptography]].

==Nomenclature==
The word [[Quantum|''quanta'']] (singular ''quantum,'' Latin for ''[[wikt:quantum|how much]]'') was used before 1900 to mean particles or amounts of different [[Quantity|quantities]], including [[electron|electricity]]. In 1900, the German physicist [[Max Planck]] was studying black-body radiation: he suggested that the experimental observations would be explained if the energy carried by electromagnetic [[wave]]s could only be released in "packets" of energy. In his 1901 article &lt;ref name="Planck1901"/&gt; in ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'' he called these packets "energy elements". In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published a paper in which he proposed that many light-related phenomena—including black-body radiation and the [[photoelectric effect]]—would be better explained by modelling electromagnetic waves as consisting of spatially localized, discrete wave-packets.&lt;ref name="Einstein1905"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A.|authorlink=Albert Einstein|year=1905|title=Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt|url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf|journal=[[Annalen der Physik]]|volume=17|pages=132–148|doi=10.1002/andp.19053220607|bibcode=1905AnP...322..132E|issue=6|language=de}}. An [[s:Translation:On a Heuristic Point of View about the Creation and Conversion of Light|English translation]] is available from [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; He called such a wave-packet ''the light quantum'' (German: ''das Lichtquant'').&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Although the 1967 [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/planck-lecture.html Elsevier translation] of Planck's Nobel Lecture interprets Planck's ''Lichtquant'' as "photon", the more literal 1922 translation by Hans Thacher Clarke and Ludwik Silberstein {{cite book|first=Max |last=Planck|title=The Origin and Development of the Quantum Theory|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4UC4AAAAIAAJ}}|year=1922|publisher=Clarendon Press}} (here [https://archive.org/details/origindevelopmen00planrich]) uses "light-quantum". No evidence is known that Planck himself used the term "photon" by 1926 (see also [http://www.nobeliefs.com/photon.htm this note]).&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''photon'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek word]] for light, ''{{lang|grc|φῶς}}'' (transliterated ''phôs''). [[Arthur Compton]] used ''photon'' in 1928, referring to [[Gilbert N. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Discordances entre l'expérience et la théorie électromagnétique du rayonnement." In Électrons et Photons. Rapports et Discussions de Cinquième Conseil de Physique, edited by Institut International de Physique Solvay. Paris: Gauthier-Villars, pp. 55–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The same name was used earlier, by the American physicist and psychologist [[Leonard T. Troland]], who coined the word in 1916, in 1921 by the Irish physicist [[John Joly]], in 1924 by the French physiologist [[René Wurmser]] (1890–1993) and in 1926 by the French physicist [[Frithiof Wolfers]] (1891–1971).&lt;ref name="kragh" /&gt; The name was suggested initially as a unit related to the illumination of the eye and the resulting sensation of light and was used later in a physiological context. Although Wolfers's and Lewis's theories were contradicted by many experiments and never accepted, the new name was adopted very soon by most physicists after Compton used it.&lt;ref name="kragh" /&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;[[Isaac Asimov]] credits [[Arthur Compton]] with defining quanta of energy as photons in 1923. {{cite book|first=Isaac |last=Asimov|title=The Neutrino: Ghost Particle of the Atom|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-SkMngEACAAJ}}|date=1 April 1983|publisher=Avon Books|isbn=978-0-380-00483-6|authorlink=Isaac Asimov|location=Garden City (NY)}} and {{cite book|first=Isaac |last=Asimov|authorlink=Isaac Asimov|title=The Universe: From Flat Earth to Quasar|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Eo5xpO83YpoC}}|date=1 January 1971|location=New York (NY)|publisher=[[Walker (publisher)|Walker]]|isbn=0-8027-0316-X|lccn=66022515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In physics, a photon is usually denoted by the symbol ''γ'' (the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[gamma]]). This symbol for the photon probably derives from [[gamma ray]]s, which were discovered in 1900 by [[Paul Ulrich Villard|Paul Villard]],&lt;ref&gt;

A photon's wave vector may not be zero and can be represented either as a [[Euclidean vector|spatial 3-vector]] or as a (relativistic) [[four-vector]]; in the latter case it belongs to the [[light cone]] (pictured). Different signs of the four-vector denote different [[circular polarization]]s, but in the 3-vector representation one should account for the polarization state separately; it actually is a [[spin quantum number]]. In both cases the space of possible wave vectors is three-dimensional.

Photons are emitted in many natural processes. For example, when a charge is [[acceleration|accelerated]] it emits [[synchrotron radiation]]. During a [[molecule|molecular]], [[atom]]ic or [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] transition to a lower [[energy level]], photons of various energy will be emitted, ranging from [[radio wave]]s to [[gamma ray]]s. Photons can also be emitted when a particle and its corresponding [[antiparticle]] are [[annihilation|annihilated]] (for example, [[electron–positron annihilation]]).&lt;ref name=Halliday/&gt;{{rp|572,1114,1172}}

In empty space, the photon moves at ''c'' (the [[speed of light]]) and its [[energy]] and [[momentum]] are related by {{nowrap|''E'' {{=}} ''pc''}}, where ''p'' is the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the momentum vector '''p'''. This derives from the following relativistic relation, with {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 0}}:&lt;ref&gt;See section 1.6 in {{harvnb|Alonso|Finn|1968|loc=Section 1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E^{2}=p^{2} c^{2} + m^{2} c^{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

The energy and momentum of a photon depend only on its [[frequency]] (''ν'') or inversely, its [[wavelength]] (''λ''):

:&lt;math&gt;E=\hbar\omega=h\nu=\frac{hc}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{p}=\hbar\boldsymbol{k},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''k''''' is the [[wave vector]] (where the wave number {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} {{!}}'''''k'''''{{!}} {{=}} 2π/''λ''}}), {{nowrap|''ω'' {{=}} 2π''ν''}} is the [[angular frequency]], and {{nowrap|''ħ'' {{=}} ''h''/2π}} is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;Davison E. Soper, [http://physics.uoregon.edu/~soper/Light/photons.html Electromagnetic radiation is made of photons], Institute of Theoretical Science, University of Oregon&lt;/ref&gt;

Since '''''p''''' points in the direction of the photon's propagation, the magnitude of the momentum is

:&lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k=\frac{h\nu}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

The photon also carries a quantity called [[Spin angular momentum of light|spin angular momentum]] that does not depend on its frequency.&lt;ref name="spin"&gt;This property was experimentally verified by Raman and Bhagavantam in 1931: {{Cite journal|last=Raman|first=C.V.|last2=Bhagavantam|first2=S.|title=Experimental proof of the spin of the photon|url=http://dspace.rri.res.in/bitstream/2289/2123/1/1931%20IJP%20V6%20p353.pdf|format=PDF|authorlink=C.

These two possible helicities, called right-handed and left-handed,&lt;!-- Which is which again?--&gt; correspond to the two possible [[circular polarization]] states of the photon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Burgess|first=C.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PLYECqs2geEC|page=27}}
|last2=Moore|first2=G.|title=The Standard Model. A Primer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=0-521-86036-9|chapter=1.3.3.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate the significance of these formulae, the annihilation of a particle with its antiparticle in free space must result in the creation of at least ''two'' photons for the following reason. In the [[center of momentum frame]], the colliding antiparticles have no net momentum, whereas a single photon always has momentum (since, as we have seen, it is determined by the photon's frequency or wavelength, which cannot be zero). Hence, [[momentum|conservation of momentum]] (or equivalently, [[translational invariance]]) requires that at least two photons are created, with zero net momentum. (However, it is possible if the system interacts with another particle or field for the annihilation to produce one photon, as when a positron annihilates with a bound atomic electron, it is possible for only one photon to be emitted, as the nuclear Coulomb field breaks translational symmetry.)&lt;ref name=Griffiths2008&gt;{{citation| author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Elementary Particles|edition=2nd revised| publisher=WILEY-VCH |year=2008|isbn= 978-3-527-40601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64–65}} The energy of the two photons, or, equivalently, their frequency, may be determined from [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation of four-momentum]]. Seen another way, the photon can be considered as its own antiparticle. The reverse process, [[pair production]], is the dominant mechanism by which high-energy photons such as [[gamma ray]]s lose energy while passing through matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alonso|Finn|1968|loc=Section 9.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; That process is the reverse of "annihilation to one photon" allowed in the electric field of an atomic nucleus.

The classical formulae for the energy and momentum of [[electromagnetic radiation]] can be re-expressed in terms of photon events. For example, the [[radiation pressure|pressure of electromagnetic radiation]] on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in [[momentum]] per unit time.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Appendix XXXII in {{cite book|first1=Max |last1=Born|first2=Roger John|last2= Blin-Stoyle|first3=J.

Each photon carries two distinct and independent forms of [[angular momentum of light]]. The [[spin angular momentum of light]] of a particular photon is always either +''ħ'' or −''ħ''.
The [[light orbital angular momentum]] of a particular photon can be any integer ''N'', including zero.&lt;ref&gt;

===Experimental checks on photon mass===
Current commonly accepted physical theories imply or assume the photon to be strictly massless. If the photon is not a strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, ''c'', in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, ''c'', would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the [[upper bound]] on speed that any object could theoretically attain in spacetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mermin, David|title=Relativity without light|doi=10.1119/1.13917|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=February 1984|volume=52|issue=2|pages=119–124|bibcode=1984AmJPh..52..119M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it would still be the speed of spacetime ripples ([[gravitational waves]] and [[graviton]]s), but it would not be the speed of photons.

If a photon did have non-zero mass, there would be other effects as well. [[Coulomb's law]] would be modified and the [[electromagnetic field]] would have an extra physical [[degree of freedom]]. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence of the speed of light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an [[electric field]] to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field.

Sharper upper limits on the speed of light have been obtained in experiments designed to detect effects caused by the galactic [[magnetic potential|vector potential]]. Although the galactic vector potential is very large because the galactic [[magnetic field]] exists on very great length scales, only the magnetic field would be observable if the photon is massless.

In most theories up to the eighteenth century, light was pictured as being made up of particles.

[[File:Light-wave.svg|thumb|340px|right|In 1900, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell's]] [[Maxwell's equations|theoretical model of light]] as oscillating [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s seemed complete. However, several observations could not be explained by any wave model of [[electromagnetic radiation]], leading to the idea that light-energy was packaged into ''quanta'' described by E=hν. Later experiments showed that these light-quanta also carry momentum and, thus, can be considered [[elementary particle|particles]]: the ''photon'' concept was born, leading to a deeper understanding of the electric and magnetic fields themselves.]]
The [[electromagnetic wave equation|Maxwell wave theory]], however, does not account for ''all'' properties of light. The Maxwell theory predicts that the energy of a light wave depends only on its [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], not on its [[frequency]]; nevertheless, several independent types of experiments show that the energy imparted by light to atoms depends only on the light's frequency, not on its intensity. For example, [[photochemistry|some chemical reactions]] are provoked only by light of frequency higher than a certain threshold; light of frequency lower than the threshold, no matter how intense, does not initiate the reaction. Similarly, electrons can be ejected from a metal plate by shining light of sufficiently high frequency on it (the [[photoelectric effect]]); the energy of the ejected electron is related only to the light's frequency, not to its intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Frequency-dependence of luminiscence p. 276f., photoelectric effect section 1.4 in {{harvnb|Alonso|Finn|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The phrase "no matter how intense" refers to intensities below approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at which point [[perturbation theory]] begins to break down. In contrast, in the intense regime, which for visible light is above approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the classical wave description correctly predicts the energy acquired by electrons, called [[ponderomotive energy]].

Since the Maxwell theory of light allows for all possible energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially that the energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein was the first to propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself.&lt;ref name="Einstein1905" /&gt; Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the ''energy'' of a Maxwellian light wave were localized into point-like quanta that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space.&lt;ref name="Einstein1905" /&gt; In 1909&lt;ref name="Einstein1909"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A.|authorlink=Albert Einstein|year=1909|title=Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung|url=http://www.ekkehard-friebe.de/EINSTEIN-1909-P.pdf|journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]|volume=10|pages=817–825|language=de}}.

The pivotal question was then: how to unify Maxwell's wave theory of light with its experimentally observed particle nature? The answer to this question occupied [[Albert Einstein]] for the rest of his life,&lt;ref name="Pais1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pais|first=A.|authorlink=Abraham Pais|year=1982|title=Subtle is the Lord: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=74596612|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-853907-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was solved in [[quantum electrodynamics]] and its successor, the [[Standard Model]] (see ''{{section link||Second quantization}}'' and ''{{section link||The photon as a gauge boson}}'', below).

==Einstein's light quantum==
Unlike Planck, Einstein entertained the possibility that there might be actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], and the [[photoelectric effect]]. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.&lt;ref&gt;''Einstein and the Quantum: The Quest of the Valiant Swabian'', A. Douglas Stone, Princeton University Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early objections==
[[File:Bohr-atom-PAR.svg|thumb|250px|Up to 1923, most physicists were reluctant to accept that light itself was quantized. Instead, they tried to explain photon behavior by quantizing only ''matter'', as in the [[Bohr model]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] (shown here). Even though these semiclassical models were only a first approximation, they were accurate for simple systems and they led to [[quantum mechanics]].]]

Einstein's 1905 predictions were verified experimentally in several ways in the first two decades of the 20th century, as recounted in [[Robert Millikan]]'s Nobel lecture.&lt;ref name="Millikan1923"&gt;{{cite web|last=Millikan|first=R.A|authorlink=Robert Millikan|year=1924|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1923/millikan-lecture.html|title=Robert A. Millikan's Nobel Lecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, before [[Compton scattering|Compton's experiment]]&lt;ref name="Compton1923" /&gt; showed that photons carried [[momentum]] proportional to their [[wave number]] (1922), most physicists were reluctant to believe that [[electromagnetic radiation]] itself might be particulate. (See, for example, the Nobel lectures of [[Wilhelm Wien|Wien]],&lt;ref name="Wien1911" /&gt; [[Max Planck|Planck]]&lt;ref name="Planck1918" /&gt; and Millikan.&lt;ref name="Millikan1923" /&gt;) Instead, there was a widespread belief that energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbed or emitted radiation. Attitudes changed over time. In part, the change can be traced to experiments such as [[Compton scattering]], where it was much more difficult not to ascribe quantization to light itself to explain the observed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hendry|first=J.|year=1980|title=The development of attitudes to the wave-particle duality of light and quantum theory, 1900–1920|journal=[[Annals of Science]]|volume=37|issue=1|pages=59–79|doi=10.1080/00033798000200121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after Compton's experiment, [[Niels Bohr]], [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|Hendrik Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|John Slater]] made one last attempt to preserve the Maxwellian continuous electromagnetic field model of light, the so-called [[BKS theory|BKS model]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1924"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohr|first=N.|authorlink=Niels Bohr|author2=[[Hendrik Anthony Kramers|Kramers, H.A.]]|author3=[[John C. Slater|Slater, J.C.]]|year=1924|title=The Quantum Theory of Radiation|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]|volume=47|issue=281|pages=785–802|doi=10.1080/14786442408565262}} Also ''[[European Physical Journal|Zeitschrift für Physik]]'', '''24''', 69 (1924).&lt;/ref&gt; To account for the data then available, two drastic hypotheses had to be made:

#'''Energy and momentum are conserved only on the average in interactions between matter and radiation, but not in elementary processes such as absorption and emission.''' This allows one to reconcile the discontinuously changing energy of the atom (the jump between energy states) with the continuous release of energy as radiation.
#'''Causality is abandoned'''. For example, [[spontaneous emission]]s are merely [[stimulated emission|emissions stimulated]] by a "virtual" electromagnetic field.

However, refined Compton experiments showed that energy–momentum is conserved extraordinarily well in elementary processes; and also that the jolting of the electron and the generation of a new photon in [[Compton scattering]] obey causality to within 10 [[picosecond|ps]]. Accordingly, Bohr and his co-workers gave their model "as honorable a funeral as possible".&lt;ref name="Pais1982" /&gt; Nevertheless, the failures of the BKS model inspired [[Werner Heisenberg]] in his development of [[matrix mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Heisenberg1932"&gt;{{cite web|last=Heisenberg|first=W.|authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/heisenberg-lecture.html|title=Heisenberg Nobel lecture|year=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few physicists persisted&lt;ref name="Mandel1976"&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Mandel|first=L.|authorlink=Leonard Mandel|year=1976|doi=10.1016/S0079-6638(08)70018-0|title=The case for and against semiclassical radiation theory|journal=[[Progress in Optics]]|editor=E. Wolf|publisher=North-Holland|volume=13|pages=27–69|series=Progress in Optics|isbn=978-0-444-10806-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in developing semiclassical models in which [[electromagnetic radiation]] is not quantized, but matter appears to obey the laws of [[quantum mechanics]]. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments for the existence of photons was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as ''absolutely'' definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, ''all'' semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;These experiments produce results that cannot be explained by any classical theory of light, since they involve anticorrelations that result from the [[measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement process]]. In 1974, the first such experiment was carried out by Clauser, who reported a violation of a classical [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]. In 1977, Kimble ''et al.'' demonstrated an analogous anti-bunching effect of photons interacting with a beam splitter; this approach was simplified and sources of error eliminated in the photon-anticorrelation experiment of Grangier ''et al.'' (1986). This work is reviewed and simplified further in Thorn ''et al.'' (2004). (These references are listed below under [[#Additional references]].)&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.

==Wave–particle duality and uncertainty principles==

[[File:Mach-Zehnder photons animation.gif|thumb|300px|right|Photons in a [[Mach–Zehnder interferometer]] exhibit wave-like interference and particle-like detection at [[Photon-counting detector|single-photon detectors]].]]
Photons, like all quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be difficult to visualize. The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as [[diffraction]] and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single photon passing through a [[double-slit experiment]] exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit. A single photon passing through a double-slit experiment lands on the screen with a [[probability distribution]] given by its interference pattern determined by [[Maxwell's equations]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1909"&gt;{{cite conference|last=Taylor|first=G.I.|authorlink=Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|year=1909|title=Interference fringes with feeble light|work=Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|volume=15|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, experiments confirm that the photon is ''not'' a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a [[beam splitter]].&lt;ref name="Saleh"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Saleh, B. E. A.  |author2=Teich, M. C. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Fundamentals of Photonics|publisher=Wiley|year=2007|isbn=0-471-35832-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the photon seems to be a [[point-like particle]] since it is absorbed or emitted ''as a whole'' by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; m across) or even the point-like [[electron]]. Nevertheless, the photon is ''not'' a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the [[electromagnetic field]], as conceived by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local [[gauge symmetry]] and the laws of [[quantum field theory]] (see ''{{section link||Second quantization}}'' and ''{{section link||The photon as a gauge boson}}'' below).

[[File:Gamma-ray-microscope.svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[thought experiment]] for locating an [[electron]] (shown in blue) with a high-resolution gamma-ray microscope. The incoming [[gamma ray]] (shown in green) is scattered by the electron up into the microscope's [[angular aperture|aperture angle]] θ. The scattered gamma ray is shown in red. [[Optics|Classical optics]] shows that the electron position can be resolved only up to an uncertainty Δx that depends on θ and the [[wavelength]] λ of the incoming light.]]

A key element of [[quantum mechanics]] is [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[uncertainty principle]], which forbids the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle along the same direction. Remarkably, the uncertainty principle for charged, material particles ''requires'' the quantization of light into photons, and even the frequency dependence of the photon's energy and momentum.

{{anchor|Locating an electron with an ideal microscope}}An elegant illustration of the uncertainty principle is Heisenberg's [[thought experiment]] for locating an electron with an ideal microscope.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg1927"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heisenberg|first=W.|authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|year=1927|url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/bond/papers/corr155.1.html|title=Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik|journal=[[European Physical Journal|Zeitschrift für Physik]]|volume=43|pages=172–198|doi=10.1007/BF01397280|bibcode=1927ZPhy...43..172H|issue=3–4|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the electron can be determined to within the [[angular resolution|resolving power]] of the microscope, which is given by a formula from classical [[optics]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta x \sim \frac{\lambda}{\sin \theta}
&lt;/math&gt;

where θ is the [[angular aperture|aperture angle]] of the microscope and λ is the wavelength of the light used to observe the electron. Thus, the position uncertainty &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; can be made arbitrarily small by reducing the wavelength λ. Even if the momentum of the electron is initially known, the light impinging on the electron will give it a momentum "kick" &lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; of some unknown amount, rendering the momentum of the electron uncertain. If light were ''not'' quantized into photons, the uncertainty &lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; could be made arbitrarily small by reducing the light's intensity. In that case, since the wavelength and intensity of light can be varied independently, one could simultaneously determine the position and momentum to arbitrarily high accuracy, violating the [[uncertainty principle]]. By contrast, Einstein's formula for photon momentum preserves the uncertainty principle; since the photon is scattered anywhere within the aperture, the uncertainty of momentum transferred equals
:&lt;math&gt;

Thus, the entire world is quantized; both matter and fields must obey a consistent set of quantum laws, if either one is to be quantized.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., p. 10f. in {{Cite book|last=Schiff|first=L.I.|title=Quantum Mechanics|edition=3rd|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1968|isbn=0-07-055287-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analogous uncertainty principle for photons forbids the simultaneous measurement of the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of photons (see [[Fock state]] and the [[Photon#Second quantization|Second quantization]] section below) in an electromagnetic wave and the phase &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; of that wave

Both photons and electrons create analogous [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference patterns]] when passed through a [[double-slit experiment]]. For photons, this corresponds to the interference of a [[electromagnetic wave equation|Maxwell light wave]] whereas, for material particles (electron), this corresponds to the interference of the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger wave equation]]. Although this similarity might suggest that [[Maxwell's equations]] describing the photon's electromagnetic wave are simply Schrödinger's equation for photons, most physicists do not agree.&lt;ref&gt;

==Stimulated and spontaneous emission==
{{Main article|Stimulated emission|Laser}}
[[File:Stimulatedemission.png|thumb|400px|right|[[Stimulated emission]] (in which photons "clone" themselves) was predicted by Einstein in his kinetic analysis, and led to the development of the [[laser]]. Einstein's derivation inspired further developments in the quantum treatment of light, which led to the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics.]]

In 1916, Albert Einstein showed that Planck's radiation law could be derived from a semi-classical, statistical treatment of photons and atoms, which implies a link between the rates at which atoms emit and absorb photons. The condition follows from the assumption that functions of the emission and absorption of radiation by the atoms are independent of each other, and that thermal equilibrium is made by way of the radiation's interaction with the atoms. Consider a cavity in [[thermal equilibrium]] with all parts of itself and filled with [[electromagnetic radiation]] and that the atoms can emit and absorb that radiation. Thermal equilibrium requires that the energy density &lt;math&gt;\rho(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; of photons with frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; (which is proportional to their [[number density]]) is, on average, constant in time; hence, the rate at which photons of any particular frequency are ''emitted'' must equal the rate at which they ''absorb'' them.&lt;ref name="Einstein1916a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A.|authorlink=Albert Einstein|year=1916|title=Strahlungs-emission und -absorption nach der Quantentheorie|journal=[[Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft]]|volume=18|pages=318–323|bibcode=1916DPhyG..18..318E|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein began by postulating simple proportionality relations for the different reaction rates involved. In his model, the rate &lt;math&gt;R_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; for a system to ''absorb'' a photon of frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and transition from a lower energy &lt;math&gt;E_{j}&lt;/math&gt; to a higher energy &lt;math&gt;E_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the number &lt;math&gt;N_{j}&lt;/math&gt; of atoms with energy &lt;math&gt;E_{j}&lt;/math&gt; and to the energy density &lt;math&gt;\rho(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; of ambient photons of that frequency,

:&lt;math&gt;
R_{ji}=N_{j} B_{ji} \rho(\nu) \!
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rate constant]] for absorption. For the reverse process, there are two possibilities: spontaneous emission of a photon, or the emission of a photon initiated by the interaction of the atom with a passing photon and the return of the atom to the lower-energy state. Following Einstein's approach, the corresponding rate &lt;math&gt;R_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for the emission of photons of frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and transition from a higher energy &lt;math&gt;E_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to a lower energy &lt;math&gt;E_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
R_{ij}=N_{i} A_{ij} + N_{i} B_{ij} \rho(\nu) \!
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for [[spontaneous emission|emitting a photon spontaneously]], and &lt;math&gt;B_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for emissions in response to ambient photons ([[stimulated emission|induced or stimulated emission]]). In thermodynamic equilibrium, the number of atoms in state i and those in state j must, on average, be constant; hence, the rates &lt;math&gt;R_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; must be equal. Also, by arguments analogous to the derivation of [[Boltzmann statistics]], the ratio of &lt;math&gt;N_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;g_i/g_j\exp{(E_j-E_i)/(kT)},&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] of the state i and that of j, respectively, &lt;math&gt;E_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; their energies, k the [[Boltzmann constant]] and T the system's [[temperature]]. From this, it is readily derived that
&lt;math&gt;g_iB_{ij}=g_jB_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;
A_{ij}=\frac{8 \pi h \nu^{3}}{c^{3}} B_{ij}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The A and Bs are collectively known as the ''Einstein coefficients''.&lt;ref&gt;Section 1.4 in {{cite book|last=Wilson|first=J.|last2=Hawkes|first2=F.J.B.|title=Lasers: Principles and Applications|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=New York|year=1987|isbn=0-13-523705-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein could not fully justify his rate equations, but claimed that it should be possible to calculate the coefficients &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; once physicists had obtained "mechanics and electrodynamics modified to accommodate the quantum hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A.|authorlink=Albert Einstein|year=1916|title=Strahlungs-emission und -absorption nach der Quantentheorie|journal=[[Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft]]|volume=18|pages=318–323|bibcode=1916DPhyG..18..318E|language=de|quote=p. 322: Die Konstanten &lt;math&gt;A^n_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^n_m&lt;/math&gt; würden sich direkt berechnen lassen, wenn wir im Besitz einer im Sinne der Quantenhypothese modifizierten Elektrodynamik und Mechanik wären."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in 1926, [[Paul Dirac]] derived the &lt;math&gt;B_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; rate constants by using a semiclassical approach,&lt;ref name="Dirac1926"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dirac|first=P.A.M.|authorlink=Paul Dirac|year=1926|title=On the Theory of Quantum Mechanics|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] A|volume=112|pages=661–677|doi=10.1098/rspa.1926.0133|bibcode=1926RSPSA.112..661D|issue=762}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1927, succeeded in deriving ''all'' the rate constants from first principles within the framework of quantum theory.&lt;ref name="Dirac1927a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dirac|first=P.A.M.|authorlink=Paul Dirac|doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0039|year=1927|title=The Quantum Theory of the Emission and Absorption of Radiation|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] A|volume=114|pages=243–265|bibcode=1927RSPSA.114..243D|issue=767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dirac1927b"&gt;

Einstein was troubled by the fact that his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not determine the ''direction'' of a spontaneously emitted photon.

Planck's law of black-body radiation follows immediately as a geometric sum. However, Debye's approach failed to give the correct formula for the energy fluctuations of blackbody radiation, which were derived by Einstein in 1909.&lt;ref name="Einstein1909" /&gt;

In 1925, [[Max Born|Born]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Pascual Jordan|Jordan]] reinterpreted Debye's concept in a key way.&lt;ref name="Born1925"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Born|first=M.|authorlink=Max Born|author2=[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]]|author3=[[Pascual Jordan|Jordan, P.]]|year=1925|title=Quantenmechanik II|journal=[[European Physical Journal|Zeitschrift für Physik]]|volume=35|pages=557–615|doi=10.1007/BF01379806|bibcode=1926ZPhy...35..557B|issue=8–9|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; As may be shown classically, the [[Fourier series|Fourier modes]] of the [[electromagnetic four-potential|electromagnetic field]]—a complete set of electromagnetic plane waves indexed by their wave vector '''k''' and polarization state—are equivalent to a set of uncoupled [[simple harmonic oscillator]]s. Treated quantum mechanically, the energy levels of such oscillators are known to be &lt;math&gt;E=nh\nu&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the oscillator frequency. The key new step was to identify an electromagnetic mode with energy &lt;math&gt;E=nh\nu&lt;/math&gt; as a state with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; photons, each of energy &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt;. This approach gives the correct energy fluctuation formula.
[[File:vertex correction.svg|thumb|left|In quantum field theory, the probability of an event is computed by summing the [[probability amplitude]] (a [[complex number]]) for all possible ways in which the event can occur, as in the [[Feynman diagram]] shown here; the probability equals the square of the [[absolute value|modulus]] of the total amplitude.]]

[[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] took this one step further.&lt;ref name="Dirac1927a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dirac1927b" /&gt; He treated the interaction between a charge and an electromagnetic field as a small perturbation that induces transitions in the photon states, changing the numbers of photons in the modes, while conserving energy and momentum overall. Dirac was able to derive Einstein's &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; coefficients from first principles, and showed that the Bose–Einstein statistics of photons is a natural consequence of quantizing the electromagnetic field correctly (Bose's reasoning went in the opposite direction; he derived [[Planck's law of black-body radiation]] by ''assuming'' B–E statistics). In Dirac's time, it was not yet known that all bosons, including photons, must obey Bose–Einstein statistics.

Dirac's second-order [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] can involve [[virtual particle|virtual photons]], transient intermediate states of the electromagnetic field; the static [[Coulomb's law|electric]] and [[magnetism|magnetic]] interactions are mediated by such virtual photons. In such [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]], the [[probability amplitude]] of observable events is calculated by summing over ''all'' possible intermediate steps, even ones that are unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy &lt;math&gt;E=pc&lt;/math&gt;, and may have extra [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] states; depending on the [[gauge fixing|gauge]] used, virtual photons may have three or four polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons. Although these transient virtual photons can never be observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of observable events. Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation calculations can give apparently [[infinity|infinite]] contributions to the sum. Such unphysical results are corrected for using the technique of [[renormalization]].

Other virtual particles may contribute to the summation as well; for example, two photons may interact indirectly through virtual [[electron]]–[[positron]] [[pair production|pairs]].&lt;ref&gt;Photon-photon-scattering section 7-3-1, renormalization chapter 8-2 in {{Cite book|last=Itzykson|first=C.|last2=Zuber|first2=J.-B.|title=Quantum Field Theory|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1980|isbn=0-07-032071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, such photon–photon scattering (see [[two-photon physics]]), as well as electron–photon scattering, is meant to be one of the modes of operations of the planned particle accelerator, the [[International Linear Collider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiglein|first=G.|title=Electroweak Physics at the ILC|journal=[[Journal of Physics: Conference Series]]|volume=110|page=042033|year=2008|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/110/4/042033|bibcode=2008JPhCS.110d2033W|issue=4|arxiv = 0711.3003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[modern physics]] notation, the [[quantum state]] of the electromagnetic field is written as a [[Fock state]], a [[tensor product]] of the states for each electromagnetic mode

:&lt;math&gt;|n_{k_0}\rangle\otimes|n_{k_1}\rangle\otimes\dots\otimes|n_{k_n}\rangle\dots&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;|n_{k_i}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; represents the state in which &lt;math&gt;\, n_{k_i}&lt;/math&gt; photons are in the mode &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt;. In this notation, the creation of a new photon in mode &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; (e.g., emitted from an atomic transition) is written as &lt;math&gt;|n_{k_i}\rangle \rightarrow|n_{k_i}+1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. This notation merely expresses the concept of Born, Heisenberg and Jordan described above, and does not add any physics.

==The hadronic properties of the photon==

A theory called [[Vector Meson Dominance]] (VMD) was developed to explain this effect.

==The photon as a gauge boson==
{{Main article|Gauge theory}}

The electromagnetic field can be understood as a [[gauge field]], i.e., as a field that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every position in [[spacetime]].&lt;ref name="Ryder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryder|first=L.H.|year=1996|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nnuW_kVJ500C}}|title=Quantum field theory|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-47814-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[electromagnetic field]], this gauge symmetry is the [[Abelian group|Abelian]] [[unitary group|U(1) symmetry]] of [[complex number]]s of absolute value 1, which reflects the ability to vary the [[complex geometry|phase]] of a complex field without affecting [[observable]]s or [[real number|real valued functions]] made from it, such as the [[energy]] or the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]].

The quanta of an [[gauge theory|Abelian gauge field]] must be massless, uncharged bosons, as long as the symmetry is not broken; hence, the photon is predicted to be massless, and to have zero [[electric charge]] and integer spin. The particular form of the [[electromagnetic interaction]] specifies that the photon must have [[spin (physics)|spin]] ±1; thus, its [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] must be &lt;math&gt;\pm \hbar&lt;/math&gt;. These two spin components correspond to the classical concepts of [[circular polarization|right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized]] light. However, the transient [[virtual photon]]s of [[quantum electrodynamics]] may also adopt unphysical polarization states.&lt;ref name="Ryder" /&gt;

In the prevailing [[Standard Model]] of physics, the photon is one of four [[gauge bosons]] in the [[electroweak interaction]]; the [[W and Z bosons|other three]] are denoted W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and are responsible for the [[weak interaction]]. Unlike the photon, these gauge bosons have [[invariant mass|mass]], owing to a [[Higgs mechanism|mechanism]] that breaks their [[special unitary group|SU(2) gauge symmetry]]. The unification of the photon with W and Z gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction was accomplished by [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Steven Weinberg]], for which they were awarded the 1979 [[Nobel Prize]] in physics.&lt;ref name="Glashow"&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/glashow-lecture.html Sheldon Glashow Nobel lecture], delivered 8 December 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salam"&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/salam-lecture.html Abdus Salam Nobel lecture], delivered 8 December 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/weinberg-lecture.html Steven Weinberg Nobel lecture], delivered 8 December 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicists continue to hypothesize [[grand unification theory|grand unified theories]] that connect these four [[gauge boson]]s with the eight [[gluon]] gauge bosons of [[quantum chromodynamics]]; however, key predictions of these theories, such as [[proton decay]], have not been observed experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., chapter 14 in {{cite book|last=Hughes|first=I. S.|title=Elementary particles|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-521-26092-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to the mass of a system==
{{See also|Mass in special relativity|Mass in general relativity}}
The energy of a system that emits a photon is ''decreased'' by the energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; of the photon as measured in the rest frame of the emitting system, which may result in a reduction in mass in the amount &lt;math&gt;{E}/{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the mass of a system that absorbs a photon is ''increased'' by a corresponding amount. As an application, the energy balance of nuclear reactions involving photons is commonly written in terms of the masses of the nuclei involved, and terms of the form &lt;math&gt;{E}/{c^2}&lt;/math&gt; for the gamma photons (and for other relevant energies, such as the recoil energy of nuclei).&lt;ref&gt;E.g., section 10.1 in {{Cite book|last=Dunlap|first=R.A.|title=An Introduction to the Physics of Nuclei and Particles|publisher=[[Cengage Learning#Brands/imprints|Brooks/Cole]]|year=2004|isbn=0-534-39294-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept is applied in key predictions of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED, see above). In that theory, the mass of electrons (or, more generally, leptons) is modified by including the mass contributions of virtual photons, in a technique known as [[renormalization]]. Such "[[radiative correction]]s" contribute to a number of predictions of QED, such as the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment|magnetic dipole moment]] of [[lepton]]s, the [[Lamb shift]], and the [[hyperfine structure]] of bound lepton pairs, such as [[muonium]] and [[positronium]].&lt;ref&gt;Radiative correction to electron mass section 7-1-2, anomalous magnetic moments section 7-2-1, Lamb shift section 7-3-2 and hyperfine splitting in positronium section 10-3 in {{Cite book|last=Itzykson|first=C.|last2=Zuber|first2=J.-B.|title=Quantum Field Theory|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1980|isbn=0-07-032071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since photons contribute to the [[stress–energy tensor]], they exert a [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] on other objects, according to the theory of [[general relativity]]. Conversely, photons are themselves affected by gravity; their normally straight trajectories may be bent by warped [[spacetime]], as in [[gravitational lens]]ing, and [[gravitational redshift|their frequencies may be lowered]] by moving to a higher [[potential energy|gravitational potential]], as in the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]]. However, these effects are not specific to photons; exactly the same effects would be predicted for classical [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]].&lt;ref&gt;E. g. sections 9.1 (gravitational contribution of photons) and 10.5 (influence of gravity on light) in {{Cite book|last=Stephani|first=H.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=V04_vLQvstcC|page=86}}|last2=Stewart|first2=J.|pages=86 ff, 108 ff.|title=General Relativity: An Introduction to the Theory of Gravitational Field|isbn=0-521-37941-5|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photons in matter==
{{See also|Group velocity|Photochemistry}}

Light that travels through transparent matter does so at a lower speed than ''c'', the speed of light in a vacuum. For example, photons engage in so many collisions on the way from the [[Solar core|core]] of the sun that radiant energy can take about a million years to reach the surface;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| title = Through the Eyes of Hubble: Birth, Life and Violent Death of Stars|first=R.|last=Naeye|publisher=CRC Press|year=1998|isbn=0-750-30484-7|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=06_9B7S_q_YC|page=16}}|oclc=40180195}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, once in open space, a photon takes only 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. The factor by which the speed is decreased is called the [[refractive index]] of the material. In a classical wave picture, the slowing can be explained by the light inducing [[electric polarization]] in the matter, the polarized matter radiating new light, and that new light interfering with the original light wave to form a delayed wave. In a particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the photon with quantum excitations of the matter to produce [[quasi-particle]]s known as [[polariton]] (other quasi-particles are [[phonon]]s and [[exciton]]s); this polariton has a nonzero [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]], which means that it cannot travel at ''c''. Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at [[variable speed of light|different speeds]]; this is called [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (not to be confused with scattering). In some cases, it can result in [[slow light|extremely slow speeds of light]] in matter. The effects of photon interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in [[Raman scattering]] and [[Brillouin scattering]].&lt;ref&gt;Polaritons section 10.10.1, Raman and Brillouin scattering section 10.11.3 in {{Cite book | last = Patterson | first=J.D. | last2 = Bailey | first2=B.C.| title = Solid-State Physics: Introduction to the Theory| publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| year=2007| isbn=3-540-24115-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photons can also be [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by nuclei, atoms or molecules, provoking transitions between their [[energy level]]s. A classic example is the molecular transition of [[retinal]] (C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;O), which is responsible for [[Visual perception|vision]], as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate [[biochemistry|biochemist]] [[George Wald]] and co-workers. The absorption provokes a [[cis-trans]] [[isomerization]] that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the [[photodissociation]] of [[chlorine]]; this is the subject of [[photochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. section 11-5 C in {{Cite book|last=Pine|first=S.H.|last2=Hendrickson |first2=J.B.|last3=Cram |first3=D.J.|last4=Hammond |first4=G.S.|title=Organic Chemistry|edition=4th|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=1980|isbn=0-07-050115-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nobel lecture given by G. Wald on December 12, 1967, online at nobelprize.org: [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1967/wald-lecture.html The Molecular Basis of Visual Excitation].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological applications==
Photons have many applications in technology. These examples are chosen to illustrate applications of photons ''per se'', rather than general optical devices such as lenses, etc. that could operate under a classical theory of light. The laser is an extremely important application and is discussed above under [[stimulated emission]].

Individual photons can be detected by several methods. The classic [[photomultiplier]] tube exploits the [[photoelectric effect]]: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. [[Semiconductor]] [[charge-coupled device]] chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic [[capacitor]] that can be detected. Other detectors such as [[Geiger counter]]s use the ability of photons to [[ionize]] gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of the gas.&lt;ref&gt;Photomultiplier section 1.1.10, CCDs section 1.1.8, Geiger counters section 1.3.2.1 in {{cite book|first=C.R.|last=Kitchin|title=Astrophysical Techniques|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton (FL)|year=2008|isbn=1-4200-8243-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planck's energy formula &lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt; is often used by engineers and chemists in design, both to compute the change in energy resulting from a photon absorption and to determine the frequency of the light emitted from a given photon emission. For example, the [[emission spectrum]] of a [[gas-discharge lamp]] can be altered by filling it with (mixtures of) gases with different electronic [[energy level]] configurations.

Under some conditions, an energy transition can be excited by "two" photons that individually would be insufficient. This allows for higher resolution microscopy, because the sample absorbs energy only in the spectrum  where two beams of different colors overlap significantly, which can be made much smaller than the excitation volume of a single beam (see [[two-photon excitation microscopy]]). Moreover, these photons cause less damage to the sample, since they are of lower energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Denk, W. |author2=Svoboda, K. |title=Photon upmanship: Why multiphoton imaging is more than a gimmick|journal=[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]|volume=18|issue=3|pages=351–357|year=1997|pmid=9115730|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)81237-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, two energy transitions can be coupled so that, as one system absorbs a photon, another nearby system "steals" its energy and re-emits a photon of a different frequency. This is the basis of [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]], a technique that is used in [[molecular biology]] to study the interaction of suitable [[protein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=J.R.|last=Lakowicz|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-PSybuLNxcAC|page=529}}|title=Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy|pages=529 ff|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=0-387-31278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different kinds of [[hardware random number generator]]s involve the detection of single photons. In one example, for each bit in the random sequence that is to be produced, a photon is sent to a [[beam-splitter]]. In such a situation, there are two possible outcomes of equal probability. The actual outcome is used to determine whether the next bit in the sequence is "0" or "1".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=T.|last=Jennewein|first2=U.|last2=Achleitner|first3=G.|last3=Weihs|first4=H.|last4=Weinfurter|first5=A.|last5=Zeilinger|title=A fast and compact quantum random number generator|doi=10.1063/1.1150518|journal=[[Review of Scientific Instruments]]|volume=71|pages=1675–1680|year=2000|arxiv=quant-ph/9912118|bibcode=2000RScI...71.1675J|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A.|last=Stefanov|first2=N.|last2=Gisin|first3=O.|last3=Guinnard|first4=L.|last4=Guinnard|first5=H.|last5=Zbiden|title=Optical quantum random number generator|journal=[[Journal of Modern Optics]]|volume=47|pages=595–598|year=2000|doi=10.1080/095003400147908|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent research==
{{See also|Quantum optics}}

Much research has been devoted to applications of photons in the field of [[quantum optics]]. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast [[quantum computer]], and the [[quantum entanglement]] of photons is a focus of research. [[Nonlinear optics|Nonlinear optical processes]] are another active research area, with topics such as [[two-photon absorption]], [[self-phase modulation]], [[modulational instability]] and [[optical parametric oscillator]]s. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons ''per se''; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of [[spontaneous parametric down conversion]] is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of [[optical communication]], especially for [[quantum cryptography]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Introductory-level material on the various sub-fields of quantum optics can be found in {{Cite book

[[Two-photon physics]] studies interactions between photons, which are rare.  In 2018, MIT researchers announced the discovery of bound photon triplets, which may involve [[polariton]]s.&lt;ref name="NW-20180216"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hignett |first=Katherine |title=Physics Creates New Form Of Light That Could Drive The Quantum Computing Revolution |url=http://www.newsweek.com/photons-light-physics-808862 |date=16 February 2018 |work=[[Newsweek]] |accessdate=17 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20180216"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liang, Qi-Yu et al. |title=Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/783 |date=16 February 2018 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=359 |issue=6377 |pages=783–786 |doi=10.1126/science.aao7293 |accessdate=17 February 2018 |arxiv=1709.01478 |bibcode=2018Sci...359..783L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pinch''' is the compression of an electrically conducting [[Electrical filament|filament]] by [[magnetic]] forces.  The conductor is usually a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], but could also be a solid or liquid [[metal]].  Pinches were the first type of device used for controlled [[fusion power|nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref name="Phillips, James 2013"&gt;Phillips, James. "Magnetic Fusion."

== Basic mechanism ==

[[File:Plasma Pinch Mechanism.png|thumb|center|600px|This is a basic explanation of how a pinch works. (1) Pinches apply a huge voltage across a tube.  This tube is filled with fusion fuel, typically deuterium gas. If the product of the voltage &amp; the charge is higher than the ionization energy of the gas the gas ionizes.  (2) Current jumps across this gap.  (3) The current makes a magnetic field which is perpendicular to the current.  This magnetic field pulls the material together. (4) These atoms can get close enough to fuse.]]

An electromagnetic aluminium can crusher consists of four main components: a [[high voltage]] [[direct current|DC]] [[power supply]], which provides a source of [[electrical energy]], a large ''energy discharge'' [[capacitor]] to accumulate the electrical energy, a high voltage switch or [[spark gap]], and a robust coil (capable of surviving high magnetic pressure) through which the stored electrical energy can be quickly discharged in order to generate a correspondingly strong pinching magnetic field (see diagram below).

[[Image:can-pincher.png|thumb|center|300px|Electromagnetic pinch "can crusher": schematic diagram]]

In practice, such a device is somewhat more sophisticated than the schematic diagram suggests, including electrical components that control the current in order to maximize the resulting pinch, and to ensure that the device works safely. For more details, see the notes.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of electromagnetic pinch can crushers can be found at (a) Bob LaPointe's site on [http://members.tm.net/lapointe/Main.html High Voltage Devices and Experiments] (b) Tristran's [http://members.tripod.com/extreme_skier/cancrusher/ Electromagnetic Can Crusher] (including schematic) (c) Sam Borros's [http://www.powerlabs.org/pssecc.htm Solid State Can Crusher]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first creation of a Z-pinch in the laboratory may have occurred in 1790 in Holland when [[Martin van Marum|Martinus van Marum]] created an explosion by discharging 100 [[Leyden jar]]s into a wire.&lt;ref&gt;van Marum M 1790 ''Proc. 4th Int. Conf. on Dense Z-Pinches'' (Vancouver 1997) (Am. Inst. Phys. Woodbury, New York, 1997) Frontispiece and p ii&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was not understood until 1905, when Pollock and Barraclough&lt;ref name="pollock"&gt;Pollock J A and Barraclough S (1905) ''Proc. R. Soc. New South Wales'' 39 131&lt;/ref&gt; investigated a compressed and distorted length of copper tube from a [[lightning rod]] after it had been struck by lightning. Their analysis showed that the forces due to the interaction of the large current flow with its own magnetic field could have caused the compression and distortion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bas Pease|R. S. Pease]], "The Electromagnetic Pinch: From [[James Arthur Pollock|Pollock]] to the [[Joint European Torus]]", "[http://nsw.royalsoc.org.au/journal/118_12.html#pease Pollock Memorial Lecture for 1984 delivered at the University of Sydney, 28 November, 1984"]: ''This review of the electromagnetic pinch starts with an exhibit taken from Pollock's work, carefully preserved and drawn to attention of modern research by [[Charles Norman Watson-Munro|Professor C. Watson-Munro]]. It is a compressed and distorted length of copper tube originally part of the lightning conductor on the Hartley Vale kerosene refinery in New South Wales. It was known to have been struck by lightning. Pollock and Barraclough (1905) from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Sydney University carried out an analysis to see whether or not the compression could have arisen from the flow of electric current. They concluded that the compressive forces, due to the interaction of the large current flow with its own magnetic field could have been responsible for the compression and distortion. As far as I know, this is the first identified piece of observational data on the electromagnetic pinch; and the first theoretical discussion of the effect.''&lt;/ref&gt; A similar, and apparently independent, theoretical analysis of the pinch effect in liquid metals was published by Northrupp in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Northrupp E F 1907 "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1907PhRvI..24..474N&amp;amp;db_key=PHY&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format= Some Newly Observed Manifestations of Forces in the Interior of an Electric Conductor]"  ''Phys. Rev.'' 24 474. He wrote: "Some months ago, my friend, Carl Hering, described to me a surprising and apparently new phenomenon which he had observed. He found, in passing a relatively large alternating current through a non-electrolytic, liquid conductor contained in a trough, that the liquid contracted in cross-section and flowed up hill lengthwise of the trough... Mr. Hering suggested the idea that this contraction was probably due to the elastic action of the lines of magnetic force which encircle the conductor... As the action of the forces on the conductor is to squeeze or pinch it, he jocosely called it the 'pinch phenomenon'.&lt;/ref&gt; The next major development was the publication in 1934 of an analysis of the radial pressure balance in a static Z-pinch by [[Willard Harrison Bennett|Bennett]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1934 | title = Magnetically Self-Focussing Streams | journal = Phys.

Thereafter, the experimental and theoretical progress on pinches was driven by [[fusion power]] research. In their article on the "Wire-array Z-pinch: a powerful x-ray source for [[inertial confinement fusion|ICF]]", M G Haines ''et al.'', wrote on the "Early history of Z-pinches".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haines | first1 = M G | last2 = Sanford | first2 = T W L | last3 = Smirnov | first3 = V P | year = 2005 | title = Wire-array Z-pinch: a powerful x-ray source for ICF | url = http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0741-3335/47/12B/S01 | journal = Plasma Phys.

==Equilibrium analysis ==

===One dimension ===
In [[plasma physics]] three pinch geometries are commonly studied: the θ-pinch, the [[Z-pinch]], and the Screw Pinch.  These are cylindrically shaped.  The cylinder is symmetric in the axial (''z'') direction and the azimuthal (θ) directions.  The one-dimensional pinches are named for the direction the current travels.

====The θ-pinch====

[[Image:thet pinch.png|right|thumb|200px|A sketch of the θ-pinch equilibrium. The {{color box| purple}} z-directed magnetic field corresponds to a {{color box|yellow}} θ-directed plasma current.]]

The θ-pinch has a magnetic field directed in the z direction and a large diamagnetic current directed in the θ direction.  Using [[Ampère's law]] (discarding the displacement term)

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
        \vec{B} &amp;= B_z(r)\hat{z} \\
  \mu_0 \vec{J} &amp;= \nabla \times \vec{B} \\
                &amp;= \frac{1}{r} \frac{d}{d \theta}B_z(r) \hat{r} - \frac{d}{dr}B_z(r) \hat{\theta}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''B'' is only a function of ''r'' we can simplify this to

: &lt;math&gt; \mu_0 \vec{J} = -\frac{d}{dr}B_z(r) \hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

So ''J'' points in the θ direction.

Thus, the equilibrium condition (∇''p'' = '''j''' × '''Β''') for the  θ-pinch reads:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{d r} \left( p + \frac{B_z^2}{2\mu_0} \right) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

θ-pinches tend to be resistant to plasma instabilities; This is due in part to [[Alfvén's Theorem]] (or, frozen in flux theorem).

====The Z-pinch====
{{main|Z-pinch}}
[[Image:z pinch.png|right|thumb|200px|A sketch of the Z-pinch equilibrium. A {{color box|purple}} θ-directed magnetic field corresponds to a {{color box|yellow}} z-directed plasma current.]]

The Z-pinch has a magnetic field in the θ direction and a current "J" flowing in the "z" direction.  Again, by electrostatic Ampère's Law

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
        \vec{B} &amp;= B_{\theta}(r)\hat{\theta} \\
  \mu_0 \vec{J} &amp;= \nabla \times \vec{B} \\
                &amp;= \frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r B_\theta(r)\right) \hat{z} - \frac{d}{dz}B_\theta(r) \hat{r} \\
                &amp;= \frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r B_\theta(r)\right) \hat{z}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the equilibrium condition, ∇''p'' = '''j''' × '''Β''', for the Z-pinch reads:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{d r} \left( p + \frac{B_\theta^2}{2\mu_0} \right) + \frac{B_\theta^2}{\mu_0 r} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since particles in a plasma basically follow magnetic field lines, Z-pinches lead them around in circles.  Therefore, they tend to have excellent confinement properties.

====The screw pinch====

The screw pinch is an effort to combine the stability aspects of the θ-pinch and the confinement aspects of the Z-pinch.  Referring once again to Ampère's Law

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J}&lt;/math&gt;

But this time, the ''B'' field has a θ component ''and'' a ''z'' component

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
        \vec{B} &amp;= B_\theta \hat{\theta} + B_z \hat{z} \\
  \mu_0 \vec{J} &amp;= \frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r B_\theta\right) \hat{z} - \frac{d}{dr}B_z \hat{\theta}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So this time ''J'' has a component in the ''z'' direction and a component in the θ direction.

Finally, the equilibrium condition (∇''p'' = '''j''' × '''Β''') for the  screw pinch reads:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{d r} \left(p + \frac{B_z^2 + B_\theta^2}{2 \mu_0} \right) + \frac{B_\theta^2}{\mu_0 r} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

====The screw pinch via colliding optical vortices====

The '' screw pinch ''  might be produced in laser plasma by colliding optical vortices of ultrashort duration.&lt;ref name="Okulov2010plasma"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose optical vortices ought to be phase-conjugated.&lt;ref name="Okulov2008_phase conjugation"&gt;

The magnetic field distribution is given here again via Ampère's law:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J}&lt;/math&gt;

===Two dimensions ===
[[Image:toroidal coord.png|right|thumb|250px|A ''toroidal coordinate system'' in common use in plasma physics.

]]

A common problem with one-dimensional pinches is the end losses.  Most of the motion of particles is along the magnetic field.  With the θ-pinch and the screw-pinch, this leads particles out of the end of the machine very quickly, leading to a loss of mass and energy.   On top of this problem, the Z-pinch has major stability problems. Though particles can be reflected to some extent with [[magnetic mirror]]s, even these allow many particles to pass.  A common method of beating these end losses, is to bend the cylinder around into a torus.  Unfortunately this breaks θ symmetry, as paths on the inner portion (inboard side) of the torus are shorter than similar paths on the outer portion (outboard side).  Thus, a new theory is needed.  This gives rise to the famous [[Grad–Shafranov equation]].  Numerical solutions to the Grad–Shafranov equation have also yielded some equilibria, most notably that of the [[reversed field pinch]].

===Three dimensions ===
As of 2015, there is not a coherent analytical theory for three-dimensional equilibria.  The general approach to finding three-dimensional equilibria is to solve the vacuum ideal MHD equations.  Numerical solutions have yielded designs for [[stellarator]]s.  Some machines take advantage of simplification techniques such as helical symmetry (for example University of Wisconsin's Helically Symmetric eXperiment). However, for an arbitrary three-dimensional configuration an equilibrium relation, similar to that of the 1-D configurations exists:&lt;ref&gt;Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics: Modern perspectives in energy. Jeffrey P. Freidberg. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Cambridge, Massachusetts. Plenum Press - New York and London - 1987. (Pg.86 &amp; 95)&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \nabla_\perp \left( p + \frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0} \right) - \frac{B^2}{\mu_0 }\vec{\kappa} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Where κ is the curvature vector defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; \vec{\kappa} = \left(\vec{b} \cdot \nabla\right)\vec{b}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''b'' the unit vector tangent to ''B''.

==Formal treatment==
[[Image:water-pinching.jpg|thumb|256px|'''A stream of water pinching''' into droplets has been suggested as an analogy to the electromagnetic pinch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trubnikov | first1 = Boris A | year = 1992 | title = A new hypothesis of cosmic ray generation in plasma pinches | bibcode=1992ITPS...20..898T | journal = IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 898–904 | doi=10.1109/27.199547}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gravity accelerates free-falling water which causes the water column to constrict. Then [[surface tension]] breaks the narrowing water column into droplets (not shown here) (see [[Plateau-Rayleigh instability]]), which is analogous to the [[magnetic field]] which has been suggested as the cause of pinching in bead lightning.&lt;ref&gt;"The PLASMAK Configuration and Ball Lightning" ([http://www.prometheus2.net/bl-tokyo.pdf PDF]) presented at the International Symposium on Ball Lightning; July 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The morphology (shape) is similar to the so-called sausage [[instability]] in plasma.]]

===The Bennett relation===
Consider a cylindrical column of fully ionized quasineutral &lt;!-- This derivation assumes that the plasma is quasineutral, otherwise N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; could not be expressed as a single N.  Of course, one could easily assume that this was implied.  Clarification may not be necessary. --&gt;plasma, with an axial electric field, producing an axial current density, '''j''', and associated azimuthal magnetic field, '''B'''. As the current flows through its own magnetic field, a pinch is generated with an inward radial force density of '''j x B'''. In a steady state with forces balancing:

:∇''p'' = ∇(''p&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; + p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') = '''j &amp;times; Β'''
where ∇''p'' is the magnetic pressure gradient, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the electron and ion pressures. Then using [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equation]] ∇ &amp;times; '''B''' = μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; '''j''' and the [[ideal gas law]] ''p = N k T'', we derive:
:&lt;math&gt;2 N k(T_e + T_i) = \frac{{\mu_0}} {4 \pi} I^2&lt;/math&gt; (the Bennett relation)
where ''N'' is the number of electrons per unit length along the axis, ''T&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the electron and ion temperatures, ''I'' is the total beam current, and ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

===The generalized Bennett relation===
[[Image:Generalized Bennett Relation diagram.png|thumb|200px|The generalized Bennett relation considers a current-carrying magnetic-field-aligned cylindrical plasma pinch undergoing rotation at angular frequency ω]]The ''Generalized Bennett Relation'' considers a current-carrying magnetic-field-aligned cylindrical plasma pinch undergoing rotation at angular frequency ω. Along the axis of the plasma cylinder flows a current density j&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in an azimuthal magnetίc field Β&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;. Originally derived by Witalis,&lt;ref&gt;Witalis, E. A.

===The Carlqvist relation===
The Carlqvist Relation, published by [[Per Carlqvist]] in 1988,&lt;ref name="adsabs.harvard.edu"/&gt; is a specialization of the Generalized Bennett Relation (above), for the case that the kinetic pressure is much smaller at the border of the pinch than in the inner parts. It takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\mu_0}} {8 \pi} I^2 (a) +\frac{1}{2}G\overline{m}^2 N^2 (a) =  \Delta W_{B_z} + \Delta W_k&lt;/math&gt;

and is applicable to many space plasmas.

The plasma is assumed to be non-rotational, and the kinetic pressure at the edges is much smaller than inside.]]

The Carlqvist Relation can be illustrated (see right), showing the total current (''I'') versus the number of particles per unit length (''N'') in a Bennett pinch. The chart illustrates four physically distinct regions. The plasma temperature is quite cold (''T''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = ''T''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = ''T''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 20 K), containing mainly hydrogen with a mean particle mass 3×10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt; kg. The thermokinetic energy ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; ''πa''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(a). The curves, ΔW&lt;sub&gt;Bz&lt;/sub&gt; show different amounts of excess magnetic energy per unit length due to the axial magnetic field B&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. The plasma is assumed to be non-rotational, and the kinetic pressure at the edges is much smaller than inside.

'''Chart regions:''' (a) In the top-left region, the pinching force dominates. (b) Towards the bottom, outward kinetic pressures balance inwards magnetic pressure, and the total pressure is constant. (c) To the right of the vertical line Δ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''B''z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the magnetic pressures balances the gravitational pressure, and the pinching force is negligible. (d) To the left of the sloping curve Δ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''B''z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the gravitational force is negligible. Note that the chart shows a special case of the Carlqvist relation, and if it is replaced by the more general Bennett relation, then the designated regions of the chart are not valid.

Carlqvist further notes that by using the relations above, and a derivative, it is possible to describe the Bennett pinch, the [[Jeans instability|Jeans criterion]] (for gravitational instability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeans | first1 = J. H. | title = The stability of a spherical nebula | journal = Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.

[[Image:Polyphenylene Oxide.png|thumb|350px|Figure 2: Representative Structure of Polyphenylene Oxide (PPO)]]
'''Phenyl ether polymers''' are a class of [[polymer]]s that contain a [[phenol|phenoxy]] and/or a [[thiophenol|thiophenoxy]] group as the repeating group in [[ether]] linkages.  Commercial phenyl ether polymers belong to two chemical classes: '''polyphenyl ethers''' ('''PPE'''s) and '''[[Poly(p-phenylene oxide)|polyphenylene oxide]]s''' ('''PPO'''s).  The phenoxy groups in the former class of polymers do not contain any substituents whereas those in the latter class contain 2 to 4 alkyl groups on the phenyl ring.  The structure of an oxygen-containing PPE is provided in Figure 1 and that of a 2, 6-xylenol derived PPO is shown in Figure 2. Either class can have the oxygen atoms attached at various positions around the rings.

== Structure and synthesis ==
[[File:Ullmann p-diphenoxybenzene.png|thumb|268px|Figure 3: [[Ullmann condensation|Ullmann Ether Synthesis]] of 4R2E (''p''-diphenoxybenzene), a simple polyphenyl ether]]
[[File:Diphenyl oxide.svg|thumb|220px|Figure 4: Structure of 2R1E [[Diphenyl Ether]]]]
[[File:3R2TE Polyphenyl Polythioether.png|thumb|220px|Figure 5: Structure of 3R2TE Polyphenyl Thioether]]
The proper name for a phenyl ether polymer is poly(phenyl ether) or polyphenyl polyether, but the name polyphenyl ether is widely accepted.  Polyphenyl ethers (PPEs) are obtained by repeated application of the [[Ullmann condensation|Ullmann Ether Synthesis]]: reaction of an alkali-metal [[phenate]] with a [[halogenated]] benzene catalyzed by copper.&lt;ref&gt;"The Ullmann Ether Condensation," by A A Moroz and Mark S Shvartsberg, 1974, Russ. Chem. Rev. 43 (8), 679-689&lt;/ref&gt;

PPEs of up to 6 phenyl rings, both oxy and thio ethers, are commercially available.  See Table 1.&lt;ref&gt;SANTOLUBES LLC Product Brochure&lt;/ref&gt;  They are characterized by indicating the substitution pattern of each ring, followed by the number of phenyl rings and the number of ether linkages.  Thus, the structure in Figure 1 with ''n'' equal to 1 is identified as pmp5P4E, indicating para, meta, para substitution of the three middle rings, a total of 5 rings, and 4 ether linkages.  Meta substitution of the aryl rings in these materials is most common and often desired.  Longer chain analogues with up to 10 benzene rings are also known.

The simplest member of the phenyl ether family is [[diphenyl ether]] (DPE), also called diphenyl oxide, the structure of which is provided in Figure 4.  Low molecular weight polyphenyl ethers and thioethers are used in a variety of applications, and include high-vacuum devices, optics, electronics, and in high-temperature and radiation-resistant fluids and greases.  Figure 5 shows the structure of the sulfur analogue of 3-R polyphenyl ether shown in Figure 3.

== Physical properties ==
Typical physical properties of polyphenyl ethers are provided in Table 2.&lt;ref&gt;Joaquim, M., "Polyphenyl Ether Lubricants" Synthetic Lubricants and High-performance Functional Fluids", R. L. Rudnick and R. L. Shubkin, Eds., p. 239, Marcel Dekker, Inc., NY, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical properties of a particular PPE depend upon the number of aromatic rings, their substitution pattern, and whether it is an ether or a thioether.  In the case of products of mixed structures, properties are hard to predict from only the structural features; hence, they must be determined via measurement.  
 
The important attributes of PPEs include their thermal and oxidative stability and stability in the presence of [[ionizing radiation]].  PPEs have the disadvantage of having somewhat high pour points.  For example, PPEs that contain two and three benzene rings are actually solids at room temperatures.  The melting points of the ordinarily solid PPEs are lowered if they contain more m-phenylene rings, alkyl groups, or are mixtures of isomers.  PPEs that contain only o- and p-substituted rings have the highest melting points.

=== Thermo-oxidative stability ===
PPEs have excellent high temperature properties and good oxidation stability.  With respect to volatilities, p-derivatives have the lowest volatilities, and the o-derivatives have the highest volatilities.  The opposite is true for flash points and fire points.  Spontaneous ignition temperatures of polyphenyl ethers lie between {{convert|550|and|595|°C}}, alkyl substitution reduces this value by ~{{convert|50|°C}}.  PPEs are compatible with most metals and elastomers that are commonly used in high-temperature applications. They typically swell common seal materials.&lt;ref&gt;"Synthetic Lubricants," Chapter 6, pp. 96–153, Lubricants and Related Products: Synthesis, Properties, Applications, International Standards by Dieter Klamann, Verlag Chemie Gmbh publisher (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxidation stability of un-substituted PPEs is quite good, partly because they lack easily oxidizable carbon-hydrogen bonds.  Thermal decomposition temperature, as measured by the [[isoteniscope]] procedure, is between {{convert|440|and|465|°C}}.

=== Radiation stability ===
Ionizing radiation affects all organic compounds, causing a change in their properties because radiation disrupts covalent bonds that are most prevalent in organic compounds.  One result of ionization is that the organic molecules disproportionate to form smaller hydrocarbon molecules as well as larger hydrocarbons molecules.  This is reflected by increased evaporation loss, lowering of the flash and fire points, and increased viscosity.  Other chemical reactions caused by radiation include oxidation and [[isomerization]].  The former leads to increased acidity, corrosivity, and coke formation; the latter causes a change in viscosity and volatility.

PPEs have extremely high radiation resistance.  Of all classes of synthetic lubricants (with the possible exception of [[perfluoropolyether]]s) the polyphenyl ethers are the most radiation resistant.&lt;ref&gt;Bolt, R. O., "Radiation Effects on Lubricants," CRC Handbook of Lubrication, Vol. I, Theory and Practice of Tribology: Applications and Maintenance, pp. 3–44 , Richard E. Booser Editor, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1983.  Carroll, J. G. and Bolt. R. O., Radiation Effects on Organic Materials, Bolt. R. O. and Carroll, J. G., Eds., Academic Press, New York, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;  Excellent radiation stability of PPEs can be ascribed to the limited number of ionizable carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds.  In one study, the performance of PPE under the influence of 1x10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; ergs/gram of radiation at {{convert|99|°C}} was compared with synthetic ester, synthetic hydrocarbon, and silicone fluids.&lt;ref&gt;Joaquim, M. E. and J. F. Herber, "Lubrication of Electronic Connectors and Equipment in Radiation Environments, http://www.chemassociates.com/products/findett/PPEs_Radiation2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; PPE showed a viscosity increase of only 35%, while all other fluids showed a viscosity increase of 1700% and gelled.  Further tests have shown PPEs to be resistant to gamma  and associated neutron radiation dosages of 1x10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; erg/g at temperatures up to {{convert|315|°C}}.

=== Surface tension ===
PPEs have high surface tension; hence these fluids have a lower tendency to wet metal surfaces.  The surface tension of the commercially available 5R4E is 49.9 dynes/cm, one of the highest in pure organic liquids.&lt;ref&gt;The Surface Tension of Pure Liquid Compounds, Joseph J. Jasper, J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, Vol. 1, No. 4, 1972; https://www.nist.gov/srd/PDFfiles/jpcrd13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This property is useful in applications where migration of the lubricant into the surrounding environment must be avoided.

== Applications ==
While originally PPEs were developed for use in extreme environments that were experienced in aerospace applications, they are now used in other applications requiring low volatility and excellent thermo-oxidative and ionizing radiation stability.  Such applications include use as [[diffusion pump]] fluids; high vacuum fluids; and in formulating jet engine/turbine lubricants, high-temperature hydraulic lubricants and greases, and heat transfer fluids.  In addition, because of excellent optical properties these fluids have found use in optical devices.

=== Ultra-high-vacuum fluids ===
[[Vacuum pump]]s are devices that remove gases from an enclosed space to greatly reduce pressure. Oil [[diffusion pump]]s in combination with a fore pump are amongst the most popular.  Diffusion pumps use a high boiling liquid of low vapor pressure to create a high-speed jet that strikes the gaseous molecules in the system to be evacuated and direct them into space that is being evacuated by the fore pump. A good diffusion fluid must therefore reflect low vapor pressure, high flash point, high thermal and oxidative stability and chemical resistance.  If the diffusion pump is operating in the proximity of ionizing radiation source, good radiation stability is also desired.

Data presented in Table 3 demonstrates polyphenyl ether to be superior to other fluids that are commonly used in diffusion pumps.&lt;ref&gt;"Inside a Vacuum Diffusion Pump," by Manuel E. Joaquim and Bill Foley; http://www.xtronix.ch/pdf/Diffusion%20Pump.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  PPEs help achieve the highest vacuum of 4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; torr at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.  Such high vacuums are necessary in equipment such as electron microscopes, mass spectrometers and that used for various surface physics studies.  Vacuum pumps are also used in the production of electric lamps, vacuum tubes, and cathode ray tubes (CRTs), semiconductor processing, and vacuum engineering.

=== Electronic connector lubricants ===
5R4E PPE has a surface tension of 49.9 dynes/cm, which is amongst the highest in pure organic liquids.  Because of this, this PPE and the other PPEs do not effectively wet metal surfaces.  This property is useful when migration of a lubricant from one part of the equipment to another part must be avoided, such as in certain electronic devices.  A thin film of polyphenyl ether on a surface is not a thin contiguous film as one would envision, but rather comprises tiny droplets.  This PPE property tends to keep the film stationary, or at least to cause it to remain in the area where the lubrication is needed, rather than migrating away by spreading and forming a new surface.   As a result, contamination of other components and equipment, which do not require a lubricant, is avoided.  The high surface tension of PPEs, therefore, makes them useful in lubricating electronic contacts. 
 
Polyphenyl ether lubricants have a 30-year history of commercial service for connectors with precious and base metal contacts in telecom, automotive, aerospace, instrumentation and general-purpose applications.&lt;ref&gt;Using Lubricants to Avoid Failures in Medical Electronic Connectors," by Sibtain Hamid in Medical Electronics Manufacturing, Spring 2004 and SANTOLUBES Brochure on Stationary lubricants prevent connector failures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SANTOLUBES Brochure on Stationary lubricants prevent connector failures&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to maintaining the current flow and providing long-term lubrication, PPEs offer protection to connectors against aggressive acidic and oxidative environments.  By providing a protective surface film, polyphenyl ethers not only protect connectors against corrosion but also against vibration-related wear and abrasion that leads to [[fretting]] wear.  The devices that benefit from the specialized properties of PPEs include cell phones, printers, and a variety of other electronic appliances.  The protection lasts for decades or for the life of the equipment.

=== Optics ===
Polyphenyl ethers (PPEs) possess good optical clarity, a high refractive index, and other beneficial optical properties.  Because of these, PPEs have the ability to meet the rigorous performance demands of signal processing in advanced photonics systems.  Optical clarity of PPEs resembles that of the other optical polymers, that is, they have refractive indices of between 1.5 and 1.7 and provide good propagation of light between approximately 400&amp;nbsp;nm and 1700&amp;nbsp;nm.  Close refractive index (RI) matching between materials is important for proper propagation of light through them.  Because of the ease of RI matching, PPEs are used in many optical devices as optical fluids.  Extreme resistance to ionizing radiation gives PPEs an added advantage in the manufacture of solar cells and solid-state UV/blue emitters and telecommunication equipment made from high-index glasses and semiconductors.

=== High-temperature and radiation-resistant lubricants ===
PPEs, being of excellent thermo-oxidative stability and radiation resistance, have found extensive use in high temperature applications that also require radiation resistance.  In addition, PPEs demonstrate better wear control and load-carrying ability than mineral oils, especially when used in bearings.

As noted earlier, PPEs were developed for use in jet engines that involved high speed-related frictional temperatures of as high as {{convert|320|°C}}.  While the use of PPEs in lubricating jet engines has somewhat subsided due to their higher cost, they are still used in some aerospace applications.  PPEs are also used as base fluids for radiation-resistant greases used in nuclear power plant mechanisms.  PPEs and their derivatives have also found use as vapor phase lubricants in gas turbines and custom bearings, and wherever extreme environmental conditions exist.  Vapor phase lubrication is achieved by heating the liquid lubricant above its boiling point.  The resultant vapors are then transported to the hot bearing surface.  If the temperatures of the bearing surface are kept below the lubricant’s boiling point, the vapors re-condense to provide liquid lubrication.

Polyphenyl ether technology can also provide superior fire safety and fatigue life, depending on the specific bearing design.  In this application, PPEs have the advantage of providing lubrication both as a liquid at low temperatures and as a vapor at temperatures above {{convert|315|°C}}.  Due to the low volatility and excellent high-temperature thermo-oxidative stability, PPEs have also found use as a lubricant for chains used in and around kilns, metal fabrication plants, and glass molding and manufacturing equipment.  In these high-temperature applications, PPEs do not form any sludge and hard deposits.  The low soft-carbon residue that is left behind is removed easily by wiping.  PPEs' low volatility, low flammability, and good thermodynamic properties make them ideally suited for use as heat transfer fluids and in heat sink applications as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hamid, S. and Burian, S. A., "Polyphenyl Ether Lubricants," published in Synthetics, Mineral Oils, and Bio-based Lubricants: Chemistry and Technology, Leslie R. Rudnick Editor, pp. 175–199, Taylor and Francis Publisher&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polyphenylene oxides (PPOs) ==
{{main|Poly(p-phenylene oxide)}}
These polymers are made through oxidative coupling of substituted phenol in the presence of oxygen and copper and amine containing catalysts, such as [[cuprous bromide]] and [[pyridine]].    See Figure 2 for the PPO structure.  PPO polymers can be classified as plastic resins.  They and their composites with polystyrene, glass, and nylon are used as high-strength, moisture-resistant engineering plastics in a number of industries, including computer, telecommunication, and automotive parts. PPOs are marketed by [[SABIC|SABIC Innovative Plastics]] under the trademarked name of Noryl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geglobalresearch.com/cooltechnologies/pdf/2002grc087.pdf 2002grc087 High Heat PPO.: 13C and 31P NMR Methods for Characterizing End Groups and Chain Structures in Poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)/Poly(2,3,6-trimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) Copolymers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''San Juanico disaster''' was an [[industry|industrial]] [[disaster]] caused by a massive series of explosions at a [[liquid petroleum gas]] (LPG) tank farm in San Juanico, Mexico (outside of [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]) on 19 November 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gas explosion|explosions]] consumed 11,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of LPG, representing one third of Mexico City's entire liquid petroleum gas supply. The explosions destroyed the facility and devastated the local town of [[San Juan Ixhuatepec]], with 500&amp;ndash;600 people killed, and 5000&amp;ndash;7000 others suffering severe burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The San Juanico disaster was one of the deadliest [[industrial disasters]] in world history.

==Facility==
The incident took place at a storage and distribution facility (a "terminal") for liquified petroleum gas (LPG) belonging to the multi-state enterprise, [[Pemex|Petroleos Mexicanos]] (PEMEX). The facility consisted of 54 LPG storage tanks; 6 large spherical tanks (four holding 1,600 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and two holding 2,400 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and 48 smaller horizontal bullet shaped tanks of various sizes. All together the tanks contained 11,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of a [[propane]]/[[butane]] mixture at the time of the accident.

==Origin==
The disaster was initiated by a [[gas leak]] on the site, likely caused by a pipe [[wikt:rupture|rupture]] during transfer operations, which caused a plume of LPG to concentrate at ground level for 10 minutes. The plume eventually grew large enough to drift on the wind towards the west end of the site, where the facility's waste-gas flare pit was located.

==The fire==
At 5:40 a.m., the cloud reached the flare and ignited, resulting in a [[vapor cloud explosion]] that severely damaged the tank farm and resulted in a massive [[conflagration]] fed by the LPG [[leak]]ing from newly damaged tanks. Just four minutes later, at 5:44 a.m., the first tank underwent a [[BLEVE]] (Boiling Liquid/Expanding Vapor Explosion). Over the next hour, 12 separate BLEVE explosions were recorded. The fire and smaller explosions continued until 10 a.m. the next morning. It is believed that the escalation was caused by an ineffective gas detection system.

==Damage and casualties==
The town of San Juan Ixhuatepec surrounded the facility and consisted of 40,000 residents, with an additional 61,000 more living in the hills. The explosions demolished houses and propelled twisted metal fragments (some measuring 30 tons) over distances ranging from a few meters to up to 1200&amp;nbsp;m. Much of the town was destroyed by the explosions and ensuing fire, with the current statistics indicating 500 to 600 deaths, and 5,000&amp;ndash;7,000 severe injuries. Radiant heat generated by the inferno incinerated most corpses to ashes, with only 2% of the recovered remains left in recognizable condition.

The formation of similar features during [[supervolcano|explosive volcanism]] is generally discounted due to the lack of [[Metamorphism|metamorphic]] effects unequivocally associated with explosions and the difficulty in reaching sufficient pressures during such an event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc1992/pdf/1219.pdf A.

==Effects==

===Mineral microstructures===

====Planar fractures====

Planar fractures are parallel sets of multiple planar cracks or cleavages in [[quartz]] grains; they develop at the lowest
pressures characteristic of [[shock waves]] (~5–8 GPa) and a common feature of quartz grains found associated with impact structures. Although the occurrence of planar fractures is relatively common in other deformed rocks, the development of intense, widespread, and closely spaced planar fractures is considered diagnostic of shock metamorphism.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/CB-954/chapter4.pdf Chapter 4, 'Shock-Metamorphic Effects in Rocks and Minerals'] of the online book, French, B.M. 1998. ''[[Traces of Catastrophe]], A handbook of shock-metamorphic effects in terrestrial meteorite impact structures'', [[Lunar and Planetary Institute]] 120pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Planar deformation features====

[[File:Suvasvesi shocked quartz.jpg|thumb|200px|Shocked quartz with two sets of ‘decorated’ planar deformation features in [[impactite|impact melt rock]] from the [[Suvasvesi]] South impact structure, Finland (thin section [[photomicrograph]], plane polarized light).]]
{{Main|Planar deformation features}}
[[Planar deformation features]], or PDFs, are optically recognizable microscopic features in [[crystallite|grain]]s of [[silicate minerals]] (usually [[quartz]] or [[feldspar]]), consisting of very narrow planes of [[glassy]] material arranged in parallel sets that have distinct orientations with respect to the grain's [[crystal structure]]. PDFs are only produced by extreme shock compressions on the scale of meteor impacts. They are not found in [[volcanic]] environments.

====Brazil twinning in quartz====

This form of [[Crystal twinning|twinning]] in quartz is relatively common but the occurrence of close-spaced Brazil twins parallel to the [[basal plane]], (0001), has only been reported from impact structures. Experimental formation of basal-orientated Brazil twins in quartz requires high stresses (about 8 [[GPa]]) and high strain rates, and it seems probable that such features in natural quartz can also be regarded as unique impact indicators.&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;

===High-pressure polymorphs===

The very high pressures associated with impacts can lead to the formation of high-pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s of various minerals. Quartz may occur as either of its two high-pressure forms, [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]]. Coesite occasionally occurs associated with [[eclogite]]s formed during very high pressure regional metamorphism but was first discovered in a meteorite crater in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chao | first1 = E.

[[File:Wells Creek shatter cones 1.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Shatter cone]]s developed in fine grained [[dolomite]] from the [[Wells Creek crater]], USA.]]Two of the high-pressure [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] of [[titanium dioxide]], one with a [[baddeleyite]]-like form and the other with a [[lead dioxide|α-PbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] structure, have been found associated with the [[Nördlinger Ries]] impact structure.&lt;ref&gt;An Ultradense Polymorph of Rutile with Seven-Coordinated Titanium from the Ries Crater, Ahmed El Goresy, Ming Chen, Leonid Dubrovinsky, Philippe Gillet, Günther Graup, Science, 2001, 293, 5534,1467 - 1470 {{doi|10.1126/science.1062342}} {{PMID|11520981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A natural shock-induced dense polymorph of rutile with α-PbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure in the suevite from the Ries crater in Germany, Ahmed El Goresy, Ming Chen, Philippe Gillet, Leonid Dubrovinsky, Günther Graup and Rajeev Ahuja, ''[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]]'', 192, 4, 2001, 485-495, {{doi|10.1016/S0012-821X(01)00480-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond, the high-pressure [[allotrope]] of [[carbon]], has been found associated with many impact structures, and both [[fullerene]]s  and [[carbyne]]s have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1999M&amp;PSA..34R..43G Gilmour, I. 1999. Carbon allotropes in impact-produced rocks], ''[[Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science]]'', 34, A43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shatter cones===
{{Main|Shatter cone}}
Shatter cones have a distinctively conical shape that radiates from the top of the cones repeating cone-on-cone, at various scales in the same sample. They are only known to form in rocks beneath [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]s or [[Underground nuclear testing|underground nuclear explosions]]. They are evidence that the rock has been subjected to a shock with pressures in the range of 2-30 [[Pascal (pressure)|GPa]].&lt;ref name=French1998&gt;{{cite book

==Occurrence==

The effects described above have been found singly, or more often in combination, associated with every impact structure that has been identified on Earth. The search for such effects therefore forms the basis for identifying possible candidate impact structures, particularly to distinguish them from volcanic features.

A '''Snakeboard''', also known as pivotboard or streetboard, is a board that was invented in [[South Africa]] in 1989 by James Fisher, Simon King and Oliver Macleod Smith. The concept was to fuse the original [[skateboard]] with elements of [[snowboarding]] and [[surfing]] to create a fun riding experience. The first prototype was constructed using two square wooden boards, an old roller skate chopped in half, and a piece of plumbing pipe to join them together. Many variants were tried before manufacturing began. The first boards to be mass-produced were made from a strong plastic nylon known as Zytel ST801.




== Performance ==
The rider of a snakeboard stands with one foot on each footplate (the feet are usually fixed to the board using bindings) and, by moving his/her feet in and out in conjunction with the shoulders and hips, is able to propel the board in any direction using only body weight. This transfer of energy is called nonholonomic locomotion. The board moves in a motion similar to that of a snake&amp;mdash;hence the sport's original name of snakeboarding. The rider of a snakeboard can ride the board on almost any terrain (depending on the setup and model of board) and even propel himself uphill and perform extreme stunts similar to those done by skateboarders and snowboarders. Snakeboards allow riders to gain momentum without the need to push themselves with their feet like skateboarders.

Quoted directly from the Snakeboard patent Abstract and Claims: "This invention relates to a skateboard comprising two footboards each of the footboards including a foot platform and wheel-set which carries two wheels in axial alignment fixed to the underside of the platform, a spacer element for holding the footboards in a spaced relationship and a pivot arrangement having a vertical pivot axis connecting each footboard to the spacer element to enable both footboards to pivot relatively to the spacer element, each wheel set including a wheel body, wheel axles which are fixed to and project from the opposite sides of the body with the wheels being journaled for rotation on the axles, a first pivot pin being attached to the wheel body with its axis in a vertical direction, a support member on the wheel body, a second pivot pin pivotally connecting the foot platform to the support member with its pivot axis normal to the wheel axis, and resilient suspension means between the support member and the underside of the foot platform for holding the platform horizontal, said pivot arrangement being pivotally engaged with the first pivot pin."

== History ==
Skatex International (Pty) Ltd is the name of the first company that manufactured boards of this kind and was the inventors' original company. Skatex International licensed Snakeboard USA to sell and distribute the boards in the United States; the sport rapidly became known as "snakeboarding". James Fisher, Simon King and Oliver Macleod Smith jointly owned the patents and trademarks for the sport. In the late 1990s, the inventors licensed PMS (UK), a toy retailer, to manufacturer the "Sydewynder" under license. Over 50,000 Sydewynders were sold in the UK and Europe. The inventors then listed their company Snakeboard International AIM market, a division of the London Stock Exchange. Later there was a reverse acquisition of Snakeboard International by a company called MV Sports. MV Sports eventually stopped manufacturing the Snakeboard. However, the sport survives today with more advanced boards and is becoming more widely known as streetboarding.

A snakeboard is self-propelled, and there is no need to touch a foot on the ground. Moreover, it is considerably easier to generate and maintain momentum than on a skateboard. To perform a trick, one's feet must be strapped to the board, which makes it harder to "bail out" of a trick or dismount. It should also be noted that while the footstraps limit the amount a rider can manipulate the board, they also facilitate certain techniques. Much like a snowboarder, the rider can perform spins and somersaults higher and farther than any skateboarder. At the same time, this means a faster learning curve. While a skateboarder will spend weeks learning the most basic maneuvers, such as the [[Ollie]], or jump, a streetboarder (snakeboarder) simply has to strap himself to the board and jump as he would without the board attached.

'''Sodium sulfate''' (also known as '''sodium sulphate''' or '''sulfate of soda''') is the [[inorganic compound]] with formula Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as well as several related [[hydrate]]s. All forms are white solids that are highly soluble in water. With an annual production of 6 million [[tonne]]s, the decahydrate is a major [[commodity]] chemical product.  It is mainly used for the manufacture of [[detergent]]s and in the [[kraft process]] of paper [[pulping]].&lt;ref&gt;Helmold Plessen "Sodium Sulfates" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia Of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, 2000, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
*Anhydrous sodium sulfate, known as the rare mineral [[thenardite]], used as a drying agent in [[organic synthesis]].
*Heptahydrate sodium sulfate, a very rare form.
*Decahydrate sodium sulfate, known as the mineral [[mirabilite]], widely used by [[chemical industry]]. It is also known as Glauber's salt.

==History==
The decahydrate of sodium sulfate is known as Glauber's salt after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]/[[Germany|German]] chemist and [[apothecary]] [[Johann Rudolf Glauber]] (1604–1670), who discovered it in 1625 in Austrian spring water. He named it ''sal mirabilis'' (miraculous salt), because of its medicinal properties: the crystals were used as a general purpose [[laxative]], until more sophisticated alternatives came about in the 1900s.&lt;ref name='szydlo'&gt;{{cite book|first = Zbigniew|last = Szydlo|authorlink = Zbigniew Szydlo|title = Water which does not wet hands: The Alchemy of Michael Sendivogius|location = London–Warsaw|publisher = Polish Academy of Sciences|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='galileo'&gt;{{cite web|url = http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/glauber.html|title = Glauber, Johann Rudolf|first = Richard S.|last = Westfall|publisher = The Galileo Project|year = 1995|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111118122205/http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/glauber.html|archivedate = 2011-11-18|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, Glauber's salt began to be used as a raw material for the [[chemical industry|industrial]] production of soda ash ([[sodium carbonate]]), by reaction with potash ([[potassium carbonate]]). Demand for soda ash increased and the supply of sodium sulfate had to increase in line. Therefore, in the nineteenth century, the large scale [[Leblanc process]], producing synthetic sodium sulfate as a key intermediate, became the principal method of soda ash production.&lt;ref name='Aftalion'&gt;{{cite book|first = Fred|last = Aftalion|title = A History of the International Chemical Industry|location = Philadelphia|publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press|year = 1991|pages = 11–16|isbn = 978-0-8122-1297-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical and chemical properties==
Sodium sulfate is very stable, being unreactive toward most [[Redox|oxidizing or reducing agents]] at normal temperatures. At high temperatures, it can be converted to [[sodium sulfide]] by [[carbothermal reduction]]:&lt;ref name='crc'&gt;{{cite book|title = Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|edition = 71st|publisher = [[CRC Press]]|location = [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]]|year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 C → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S  +  2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Acid-base===
Sodium sulfate is a [[Acidity|neutral]] salt: its aqueous solutions exhibit a pH of 7. The neutrality of such solutions reflects the fact that sulfate is derived, formally, from the strong acid [[sulfuric acid]].   Furthermore, the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, with only a single positive charge, only weakly polarizes its water ligands provided there are metal ions in solution.  Sodium sulfate reacts with sulfuric acid to give the [[acid salt]] [[sodium bisulfate]]:&lt;ref name='merck'&gt;{{cite book|title = The Merck Index|edition = 7th|publisher = [[Merck &amp; Co.]]|location = Rahway, New Jersey, US|year = 1960|title-link = Merck Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Howard |last = Nechamkin|title = The Chemistry of the Elements|publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]]|location = New York|year = 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   ⇌ 2 NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
The [[equilibrium constant]] for this process depends on [[concentration]] and temperature.

===Solution and ion exchange===
Sodium sulfate has unusual solubility characteristics in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = W.F.|last = Linke|author2=A. Seidell |title = Solubilities of Inorganic and Metal Organic Compounds|edition = 4th|publisher = Van Nostrand|year = 1965|isbn = 978-0-8412-0097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its solubility in water rises more than tenfold between 0&amp;nbsp;°C to 32.384&amp;nbsp;°C, where it reaches a maximum of 49.7&amp;nbsp;g/100 mL. At this point the solubility curve changes slope, and the solubility becomes almost independent of temperature. This temperature at 32.384&amp;nbsp;°C, corresponding to the release of crystal water and melting of the hydrated salt, serves as an accurate temperature reference for thermometer [[calibration]].

Sodium sulfate is a typical electrostatically bonded [[ion]]ic sulfate, containing Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and [[sulfate|SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions. The existence of sulfate in solution is indicated by the easy formation of insoluble sulfates when these solutions are treated with [[barium|Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] or [[lead|Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] salts:
: Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 NaCl  +  BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
[[File:Na2SO4 solubility.png|thumb|Graph showing solubility of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; vs. temperature.]]

Sodium sulfate displays a moderate tendency to form [[double salt]]s. The only [[alum]]s formed with common trivalent metals are NaAl(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (unstable above 39&amp;nbsp;°C) and NaCr(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in contrast to [[potassium sulfate]] and [[ammonium sulfate]] which form many stable alums.&lt;ref name=Lipson1935&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Lipson| first1=Henry| authorlink1=Henry Lipson | first2=C.

===Structure===
Crystals consist of [Na(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions with [[octahedral molecular geometry]].  These octahedral share edges such that eight of the 10 water molecules are bound to sodium and two others are interstitial, being hydrogen bonded to sulfate.  These cations are linked to the sulfate anions via [[hydrogen bond]]s.  The Na-O distances are 240 [[picometer|pm]].&lt;ref&gt;Helena W. Ruben, David H. Templeton, Robert D. Rosenstein, Ivar Olovsson "Crystal Structure and Entropy of Sodium Sulfate Decahydrate" J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961, volume 83, pp 820–824. {{DOI|10.1021/ja01465a019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crystalline sodium sulfate decahydrate is also unusual among hydrated salts in having a measureable [[residual entropy]] (entropy at [[absolute zero]]) of 6.32&amp;nbsp;J·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is ascribed to its ability to distribute water much more rapidly compared to most hydrates.&lt;ref name="Brodale1957"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Brodale|first = G.|author2=W.F.

==Production==
The world production of sodium sulfate, almost exclusively in the form of the decahydrate amounts to approximately 5.5 to 6&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;tonnes annually (Mt/a). In 1985, production was 4.5&amp;nbsp;Mt/a, half from natural sources, and half from chemical production. After 2000, at a stable level until 2006, natural production had increased to 4&amp;nbsp;Mt/a, and chemical production decreased to 1.5 to 2&amp;nbsp;Mt/a, with a total of 5.5 to 6&amp;nbsp;Mt/a.&lt;ref name='ceh'&gt;{{cite book|first = Bala|last = Suresh|author2 = Kazuteru Yokose|title = Sodium sulfate|url = http://www.sriconsulting.com/CEH/Public/Reports/771.1000/?Abstract.html|location = Zurich|publisher = Chemical Economic Handbook SRI Consulting|date = May 2006|pages = 771.1000A–771.1002J|work = CEH Marketing Research Report|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070314084954/http://www.sriconsulting.com/CEH/Public/Reports/771.1000/?Abstract.html|archivedate = 2007-03-14|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='usgs'&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/sodium_sulfate/stat|title = Statistical compendium Sodium sulfate|publisher = [[US Geological Survey]], Minerals Information|location = Reston, Virginia|year = 1997|accessdate = 2007-04-22|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070307171936/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/sodium_sulfate/stat/|archivedate = 2007-03-07|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='roskill'&gt;{{cite book|title = The economics of sodium sulphate|edition = Eighth|year = 1999|location = London|publisher = Roskill Information Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='chemsys'&gt;{{cite book|title = The sodium sulphate business|date=November 1984|location = London|publisher = Chem Systems International}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all applications, naturally produced and chemically produced sodium sulfate are practically interchangeable.

===Natural sources===
Two thirds of the world's production of the decahydrate (Glauber's salt) is from the natural mineral form [[mirabilite]], for example as found in lake beds in southern [[Saskatchewan]]. In 1990, [[Mexico]] and [[Spain]] were the world's main producers of natural sodium sulfate (each around 500,000&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s), with [[Russia]], [[United States]] and [[Canada]] around 350,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes each.&lt;ref name='usgs'/&gt; Natural resources are estimated at over 1 billion tonnes.&lt;ref name='ceh'/&gt;&lt;ref name='usgs'/&gt;

Major producers of 200,000 to 1,500,000 tonnes/year in 2006 included [[Searles Valley Minerals]] (California, US), Airborne Industrial Minerals (Saskatchewan, Canada), [[Química del Rey]] (Coahuila, Mexico), Minera de Santa Marta and Criaderos Minerales Y Derivados, also known as [[Grupo Crimidesa]] (Burgos, Spain), Minera de Santa Marta (Toledo, Spain), Sulquisa (Madrid, Spain), Chengdu Sanlian Tianquan Chemical ([[Tianquan County]], Sichuan, China), Hongze Yinzhu Chemical Group ([[Hongze District]], Jiangsu, China), {{ill|Nafine Chemical Industry Group|lt=|zh|南风化工}} (Shanxi, China), Sichuan Province Chuanmei Mirabilite ({{ill|万胜镇|lt=|zh|万胜镇}}, [[Dongpo District]], [[Meishan]], Sichuan, China), and Kuchuksulphat JSC (Altai Krai, Siberia, Russia).&lt;ref name='ceh'/&gt;&lt;ref name='roskill'/&gt;

Anhydrous sodium sulfate occurs in arid environments as the mineral [[thenardite]]. It slowly turns to mirabilite in damp air. Sodium sulfate is also found as [[glauberite]], a calcium sodium sulfate mineral. Both minerals are less common than mirabilite.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Chemical industry===
About one third of the world's sodium sulfate is produced as by-product of other processes in chemical industry. Most of this production is chemically inherent to the primary process, and only marginally economical. By effort of the industry, therefore, sodium sulfate production as by-product is declining.

The most important chemical sodium sulfate production is during [[hydrochloric acid]] production, either from [[sodium chloride]] (salt) and [[sulfuric acid]], in the [[Mannheim process]], or from [[sulfur dioxide]] in the [[James Hargreaves (chemist)|Hargreaves process]].&lt;ref name='kirk-othmer'&gt;{{cite book|first = D.|last = Butts|title = Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|edition = 4th|volume = v22|pages =403–411|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='hargreaves'&gt;{{cite journal|first = J.|last = Hargreaves|title =|journal = Chem. News|volume = 27|page = 183|year = 1873}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting sodium sulfate from these processes is known as '''''salt cake'''''.
:Mannheim: 2 NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 HCl + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
:Hargreaves: 4 NaCl + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 4 HCl + 2 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

The second major production of sodium sulfate are the processes where surplus [[sodium hydroxide]] is [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralised]] by sulfuric acid, as applied on a large scale in the production of [[rayon]]. This method is also a regularly applied and convenient laboratory preparation.
: 2 NaOH([[Aqueous|aq]]) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O([[Liquid|l]])

In the laboratory it can also be synthesized from the reaction between [[sodium bicarbonate]] and [[magnesium sulfate]].
: 2NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Formerly, sodium sulfate was also a by-product of the manufacture of [[sodium dichromate]], where sulfuric acid is added to sodium chromate solution forming sodium dichromate, or subsequently chromic acid. Alternatively, sodium sulfate is or was formed in the production of [[lithium carbonate]], [[chelating agent]]s, [[resorcinol]], [[ascorbic acid]], [[silica]] pigments, [[nitric acid]], and [[phenol]].&lt;ref name='ceh'/&gt;

Bulk sodium sulfate is usually purified via the decahydrate form, since the anhydrous form tends to attract [[iron]] compounds and [[organic compound]]s. The anhydrous form is easily produced from the hydrated form by gentle warming.

Major sodium sulfate by-product producers of 50–80 Mt/a in 2006 include Elementis Chromium (chromium industry, Castle Hayne, NC, US), Lenzing AG (200 Mt/a, rayon industry, Lenzing, Austria), Addiseo (formerly Rhodia, methionine industry, Les Roches-Roussillon, France), Elementis (chromium industry, Stockton-on-Tees, UK), Shikoku Chemicals (Tokushima, Japan) and Visko-R (rayon industry, Russia).&lt;ref name='ceh'/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Sulfate clump.ogv|thumb|Sodium sulfate used to dry an organic liquid. Here clumps form, indicating the presence of water in the organic liquid.]]
[[File:Sulfate noclump.ogg|thumb|By further application of sodium sulfate the liquid may be brought to dryness, indicated here by the absence of clumping.]]

===Commodity industries===

With US pricing at $30 per tonne in 1970,6 up to $90 per tonne for salt cake quality and $130 for better grades, sodium sulfate is a very cheap material. The largest use is as [[Filler (materials)|filler]] in powdered home laundry detergents, consuming approx. 50% of world production. This use is waning as domestic consumers are increasingly switching to compact or liquid detergents that do not include sodium sulfate.&lt;ref name='ceh'/&gt;

Another formerly major use for sodium sulfate, notably in the US and Canada, is in the [[Kraft process]] for the manufacture of [[wood pulp]]. Organics present in the "black liquor" from this process are burnt to produce heat, needed to drive the [[Redox|reduction]] of sodium sulfate to [[sodium sulfide]]. However, due to advances in the thermal efficiency of the Kraft recovery process in the early 1960s, more efficient sulfur recovery was achieved and the need for sodium sulfate makeup was drastically reduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Gary|last = Smook|title = Handbook for Pulp and Paper Technologists|url = http://imisrise.tappi.org/TAPPI/Products/02/SMO/0202SMOOK4.aspx|year = 2002|page = 143|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160807043026/http://imisrise.tappi.org/TAPPI/Products/02/SMO/0202SMOOK4.aspx|archivedate = 2016-08-07|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Hence, the use of sodium sulfate in the US and Canadian pulp industry declined from 1.4 Mt/a in 1970 to only approx. 150,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes in 2006.&lt;ref name='ceh'/&gt;

The [[glass]] industry provides another significant application for sodium sulfate, as second largest application in Europe. Sodium sulfate is used as a [[fining agent]], to help remove small air bubbles from molten glass. It fluxes the glass, and prevents scum formation of the glass melt during refining. The glass industry in Europe has been consuming from 1970 to 2006 a stable 110,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes annually.&lt;ref name='ceh'/&gt;

Sodium sulfate is important in the manufacture of [[textiles]], particularly in Japan, where it is the largest application. Sodium sulfate helps in "levelling", reducing negative charges on fibres so that dyes can penetrate evenly. Unlike the alternative [[sodium chloride]], it does not corrode the [[stainless steel]] vessels used in dyeing. This application in Japan and US consumed in 2006 approximately 100,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes.&lt;ref name='ceh'/&gt;

===Thermal storage===

The high heat storage capacity in the phase change from solid to liquid, and the advantageous phase change temperature of 32&amp;nbsp;°C (90&amp;nbsp;°F) makes this material especially appropriate for storing low grade solar heat for later release in space heating applications. In some applications the material is incorporated into thermal tiles that are placed in an attic space while in other applications the salt is incorporated into cells surrounded by solar–heated water. The phase change allows a substantial reduction in the mass of the material required for effective heat storage (the heat of fusion of sodium sulfate decahydrate is 82 kJ/mol or 252 kJ/kg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.mie-u.ac.jp/research/activities/29/29_31.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924000749/http://www.eng.mie-u.ac.jp/research/activities/29/29_31.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), with the further advantage of a consistency of temperature as long as sufficient material in the appropriate phase is available.

For cooling applications, a mixture with common [[sodium chloride]] salt (NaCl) lowers the melting point to 18&amp;nbsp;°C (64&amp;nbsp;°F).  The heat of fusion of NaCl·Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is actually ''increased'' slightly to 286 kJ/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.mie-u.ac.jp/research/activities/29/29_31.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924000749/http://www.eng.mie-u.ac.jp/research/activities/29/29_31.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }} p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small-scale applications===

In the laboratory, anhydrous sodium sulfate is widely used as an inert [[desiccant|drying agent]], for removing traces of water from organic solutions.&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book|last = Vogel|first = Arthur I. |author2=B.V. Smith |author3=N.M. Waldron|edition = 3rd|title = Vogel's Elementary Practical Organic Chemistry 1 Preparations|publisher = [[Longman]] Scientific &amp; Technical|location = London|year = 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more efficient, but slower-acting, than the similar agent [[magnesium sulfate]]. It is only effective below about 30&amp;nbsp;°C, but it can be used with a variety of materials since it is chemically fairly inert. Sodium sulfate is added to the solution until the crystals no longer clump together; the two video clips (see above) demonstrate how the crystals clump when still wet, but some crystals flow freely once a sample is dry.

Glauber's salt, the decahydrate, was historically used as a [[laxative]]. It is effective for the removal of certain drugs such as [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) from the body, for example, after an overdose.&lt;ref name=Cocchetto1981&gt;{{cite journal|last = Cocchetto|first = D.M.|author2=G. Levy |year = 1981|title = Absorption of orally administered sodium sulfate in humans|journal = J Pharm Sci|volume = 70|issue = 3|pages =331–3| doi = 10.1002/jps.2600700330|pmid = 7264905}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Prescott1979&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Prescott|first1 = L.

In 1953, sodium sulfate was proposed for [[heat]] storage in passive [[solar heating]] systems. This takes advantage of its unusual solubility properties, and the high heat of [[crystallisation]] (78.2&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Maria|last = Telkes|title = Improvements in or relating to a device and a composition of matter for the storage of heat|url = http://v3.espacenet.com/textdes?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=GB694553&amp;F=0&amp;QPN=GB694553|work = British Patent No. GB694553|year = 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other uses for sodium sulfate include de-frosting windows, [[starch]] manufacture, as an additive in carpet fresheners, and as an additive to cattle feed.

At least one company, Thermaltake, makes a laptop computer chill mat (iXoft Notebook Cooler) using sodium sulfate decahydrate inside a quilted plastic pad. The material slowly turns to liquid and recirculates, equalizing laptop temperature and acting as an insulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thermaltake.com/products-model_Specification.aspx?id=C_00000712 | title = IXoft Specification | publisher = Thermaltake Technology Co., Ltd. | accessdate = 2015-08-15 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160312234730/http://www.thermaltake.com/products-model_Specification.aspx?id=C_00000712 | archivedate = 2016-03-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Although sodium sulfate is generally regarded as non-toxic,&lt;ref name="WHO2000"&gt;{{cite web|title = Sodium sulfate (WHO Food Additives Series 44)|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|year = 2000|url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v44jec07.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-06|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070904064342/http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v44jec07.htm|archivedate = 2007-09-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; it should be handled with care.

[[File:Réacteur à sels stables.jpg|thumb|A stable salt reactor core, with support structures in grey, heat exchangers and pumps in green, and fuel assemblies in red.]]
The '''stable salt reactor''' (SSR) is a nuclear reactor design proposed by Moltex Energy Ltd&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.moltexenergy.com/ |title=Moltex Energy {{!}} Safer Cheaper Cleaner Nuclear {{!}} Stable Salt Reactors {{!}} SSR |publisher= Moltex Energy LLP |access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in the [[United Kingdom]].

Moltex Energy proposes the SSR as an improved version of the [[molten salt reactor]] with improved safety characteristics and economics. 
Stable salt reactors do not need expensive containment structures and components to keep them in a stable condition. 
In the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl accident]] the two most troublesome by-products were [[caesium-137]] and [[iodine-131]] in gaseous form, which are harmful to land and people. This hazard is inherent with any water-cooled reactor, but in a molten salt reactor these elements do not exist in the form of a gas — they are bound in nonvolatile salts, which cannot escape the plant in most accident scenarios.

Moltex Energy have used [[computational fluid dynamics]] to prove the feasibility of a static fuel concept. Solid fuel in fuel rods is replaced by molten salt fuel, in assemblies that are very similar to current light water reactor technology. The result is a simple, low cost reactor that uses components from today’s nuclear fleet but has all the safety advantages of a molten salt fuel.

==Technology==
[[File:RSS - crayon &amp; assemblage.jpg|thumb|Single fuel tube showing 'diving bell' gas vent and an entire assembly.]]
The basic unit of the reactor core is the fuel assembly.  Each assembly contains nearly 400 fuel tubes of 10&amp;nbsp;mm diameter with a 1&amp;nbsp;mm helical wire wrap filled to a height of 1.6&amp;nbsp;metres with fuel salt. The tubes have diving bell gas vents at the top to allow fission gasses to escape.

An unusual design feature of the reactor is that its core is rectangular in shape. This is neutronically inefficient compared to a cylindrical core but allows for simpler movement of fuel assemblies, and extension of the core as required simply by adding additional modules.

The assemblies move laterally through the core, with fresh assemblies entering at the sides in opposite directions, similar to the refuelling of [[CANDU reactor]]s. They are raised only slightly to move them into an adjacent slot, remaining in the coolant at all times.

===Modular construction===
[[File:SSR module and core section.jpg|thumb|Reactor module, and 300&amp;nbsp;MWe reactor core with 2 modules.]]
The reactor core is composed of modules, each with a thermal output of 375&amp;nbsp;MW, containing 10&amp;nbsp;rows of 10 fuel assemblies, upper and lower support grids, heat exchangers, pumps, control assemblies and instrumentation. 
Two or more of these modules are assembled side by side in a rectangular reactor tank.
A 1200&amp;nbsp;MWe reactor is possible in a tank that can fit on the back of a truck, making the technology significantly more compact than today’s reactors.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The modules (without fuel assemblies) are planned to be delivered to the construction site pre-assembled and pre-tested as single road-transportable components. 
They are installed into the stainless steel tank when the civil works phase is complete during commissioning.

The upper part of the reactor consists of an [[argon]] containment dome, incorporating two crane-type systems, a low-load device designed to move fuel assemblies within the reactor core and a high-load device designed to raise and lower fuel assemblies into the coolant, and to replace entire modules should that be necessary. 
All reactor maintenance is planned to be carried out remotely.

===Fuel and materials===
The fuel in the SSR is composed of two-thirds [[sodium chloride]] (table salt) and one-third [[plutonium]] and mixed [[lanthanide]]/[[actinide]] trichlorides. 
Fuel for the initial six reactors is expected to come from stocks of pure plutonium dioxide from [[PUREX]] reprocessed conventional spent nuclear fuel, mixed with pure [[depleted uranium]] trichloride. 
Further fuel can come from reprocessed nuclear waste from today’s fleet of reactors.

Trichlorides are more thermodynamically stable than the corresponding fluoride salts and can therefore be maintained in a strongly reducing state by contact with sacrificial nuclear grade zirconium metal added as a coating on, or an insert within, the fuel tube.
As a result, the fuel tube can be made from standard nuclear certified steel without risk of corrosion. 
Since the reactor operates in the fast spectrum, the tubes will be exposed to very high [[neutron flux]] and suffer high damage (dpa) levels, estimated at 100–200&amp;nbsp;dpa over the tube life. 
Highly neutron damage tolerant steels such as PE16 will therefore be used for the tubes. 
Assessment is also being carried out on other steels with fast-neutron data such as HT9, NF616 and 15-15Ti.

The average power density in the fuel salt is 150&amp;nbsp;kW/l which allows a large temperature margin below the boiling point of the salt.{{cn|date=September 2018}}
Power peaking to double this level for substantial periods would not exceed the safe operating conditions for the fuel tube.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

===Coolant===
The coolant salt in the reactor tank is a sodium zirconium fluoride mixture. The zirconium is not nuclear-grade and still contains ~2% [[hafnium]]. This has minimal effect on core reactivity but makes the coolant salt low-cost and a highly effective neutron shield. One metre of coolant reduces neutron flux by four orders of magnitude. All components in the SSR are protected by this coolant shield.

The coolant also contains 1&amp;nbsp;mol% zirconium metal (which dissolves forming 2&amp;nbsp;mol% ZrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This reduces its [[Reduction potential|redox potential]] to a level making it virtually non-corrosive to standard steels. The reactor tank, support structures and heat exchangers can therefore be constructed from standard [[SAE 316L stainless steel|316L stainless steel]].

The coolant salt is circulated through the reactor core by four pumps attached to the heat exchangers in each module. Flow rates are modest, approximately 1&amp;nbsp;m/s with resulting low requirement for pump power. There is redundancy to continue operation in the event of a pump failure.

==Safety==
The stable salt reactor was designed with intrinsic safety characteristics being the first line of defence. There is no operator or active system required to maintain the reactor in a safe and stable state. The following are primary intrinsic safety features behind the SSR:

=== Reactivity control ===
The SSR is self-controlling and no mechanical control is required. There is zero excess reactivity at any time; i.e. the rate at which fission generates heat matches the rate at which heat is being removed. This is made possible by the combination of a high negative [[temperature coefficient of reactivity]] and the ability to continually extract heat from the fuel tubes. As heat is taken out of the system the temperature drops, causing the reactivity to go up. When the reactor heats up the reactivity goes down, making it stable at all times.

===Non-volatile radioactive material===
Use of molten salt fuel with the appropriate chemistry eliminates the hazardous volatile iodine and caesium, making multi-layered containment unnecessary in preventing airborne radioactive plumes in severe accident scenarios.
The [[noble gas]]ses [[xenon]] and [[krypton]] would leave the reactor core in normal operation, but be trapped until their radioactive isotopes decay, so there would be very little that could be released in an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moltexenergy.com/learnmore/Moltex_Gaseous.pdf|title=Gaseous Fission Products in the Stable Salt Reactor|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Moltex Energy Ltd|format=PDF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No high pressures===
High pressures within a reactor provide a driving force for dispersion of radioactive materials from a water-cooled reactor.  Molten salt fuels and coolants have boiling points far above the SSR's operating temperature, so its core runs at atmospheric pressure. Physical separation of the steam generating system from the radioactive core by means of a secondary coolant loop eliminates that driving force from the reactor. High pressures within fuel tubes are avoided by venting off fission gases into the surrounding coolant salt.

===Low chemical reactivity===
[[Zirconium]] in [[pressurized water reactor]]s (PWRs) and [[sodium]] in [[fast reactor]]s both create the potential for severe explosion and fire risks. 
There are no chemically-reactive materials used in the SSR.

===Decay heat removal===
Immediately after a nuclear reactor shuts down, almost 7% of its previous operating power continues to be generated, from the decay of short-halflife [[fission products]]. In conventional reactors, removing this [[decay heat]] passively is challenging because of their low temperatures. The SSR operates at much higher temperatures so this heat can be rapidly transferred away from the core. In the event of a reactor shutdown and failure of all active heat-removal systems in the SSR, decay heat from the core dissipates into air cooling ducts around the perimeter of the tank that operate continually. The main heat transfer mechanism is radiative. Heat transfer goes up substantially with temperature so is negligible at operating conditions but is sufficient for decay heat removal at higher accident temperatures. The reactor components are not damaged during this process and the plant can be restarted afterwards.

==A solution to the nuclear waste legacy==
Most countries that use nuclear power choose to store spent nuclear fuel deep underground until its [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] has reduced to levels similar to natural uranium. Acting as a wasteburner, the SSR offers a different way to manage this waste.

Operating in the fast spectrum, the SSR is effective at transmuting long-lived actinides into more stable isotopes. Today’s reactors that are fuelled by reprocessed spent fuel need very-high-purity plutonium to form a stable pellet. The SSR can have any level of lanthanide and actinide contamination in its fuel as long as it can still go critical. This low level of purity greatly simplifies the reprocessing method for existing waste.

The method used is based on [[Nuclear_reprocessing#Pyroprocessing|pyroprocessing]] and is well understood. A 2016 report by the Canadian National Laboratories on reprocessing of CANDU fuel estimates that pyroprocessing would be about half the cost of more conventional reprocessing. Pyroprocessing for the SSR uses only one third of the steps of conventional pyroprocessing, which will make it even cheaper. It is potentially competitive with the cost of manufacturing fresh fuel from mined uranium.

The waste stream from the SSR will be in the form of solid salt in tubes. This can be vitrified and stored underground for over 100,000 years as is planned today, or it can be reprocessed. In that case, [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]] would be separated out and safely stored at ground level for the few hundred years needed for them to decay to levels similar to uranium ore. The troublesome long-lived [[actinide]]s and the remaining fuel would go back into the reactor where they to be burnt and transmuted into more-stable isotopes.

==Other stable salt reactor designs==
Stable salt reactor technology is highly flexible and can be adapted to several different reactor designs. The use of molten salt fuel in standard fuel assemblies allows Stable Salt versions of many of the large variety of nuclear reactors considered for development worldwide. The focus today however is to allow rapid development and roll out of low-cost reactors.

Moltex Energy is focussed on deployment of the fast spectrum SSR-Wasteburner discussed above. This decision is primarily driven by the lower technical challenges and lower predicted cost of this reactor.

In the longer term the fundamental breakthrough of molten fuel salt in tubes opens up other options. These have been developed to a conceptual level to confirm their feasibility. They include:

*'''Uranium burner (SSR-U)''' This is a thermal spectrum reactor burning [[low-enriched uranium]] which may be more suited to nations without an existing nuclear fleet and concerns about waste. It is moderated with [[graphite]] as part of the fuel assembly.
*'''Thorium breeder (SSR-Th)''' This reactor contains [[thorium]] in the coolant salt which can breed new fuel. Thorium is an abundant fuel source that can provide energy security to nations without indigenous uranium reserves. 
With this range of reactor options and the large global reserves of uranium and thorium available, the Stable Salt Reactor can fuel the planet for several thousands of years.

==Economics==
The [[overnight capital cost]] of the stable salt reactor was estimated at $1,950/kW by an independent UK nuclear engineering firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brooking|first=Jon |date=2015-01-01 |title= Design review and hazop studies for stable salt reactor |url= http://inis.iaea.org/Search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:47073950 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For comparison, the capital cost of a modern pulverised coal power station in the United States is $3,250/kW and the cost of large-scale nuclear is $5,500/kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://analysis.nuclearenergyinsider.com/moltex-energy-sees-uk-canada-smr-licensing-springboard-asia |title=Moltex Energy sees UK, Canada SMR licensing as springboard to Asia |work= Nuclear Energy Insider |date= June 28, 2016 |access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Further reductions to this overnight cost are expected for modular factory-based construction.

This low capital cost results in a [[levelised cost of electricity]] (LCOE) of $44.64/MWh with substantial potential for further reductions, because of the greater simplicity and intrinsic safety of the SSR.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The [[International Energy Agency]] predicts that nuclear will maintain a constant small role in global energy supply with a market opportunity of 219&amp;nbsp;GWe up to 2040. 
With the improved economics of the SSR, Moltex Energy predicts that it has the potential to access a market of over 1,300&amp;nbsp;GWe by 2040.

==Development==
{{update section|date=September 2018}}
A patent was granted in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/65e7697f591b41905b81/GB2508537A.pdf |title=Patent GB2508537A |last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A design has been developed and a safety case is well under way, to begin formal discussions with nuclear regulatory authorities.

[[File:Clerck1757-title-page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the 1757 edition of ''Svenska Spindlar'']]

The book '''''{{Lang|sv|Svenska Spindlar}}''''' or '''''{{lang|la|Aranei Svecici}}''''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Latin]], respectively, for "Swedish spiders") was one of the major works of the Swedish arachnologist and entomologist [[Carl Alexander Clerck]] and appeared in Stockholm in the year 1757. It was the first comprehensive book on the spiders of Sweden and one of the first regional monographs of a group of animals worldwide. The full title of the work was ''{{lang|sv|Svenska Spindlar uti sina hufvud-slägter indelte samt under några och sextio särskildte arter beskrefne och med illuminerade figurer uplyste}} – {{lang|la|Aranei Svecici, descriptionibus et figuris æneis illustrati, ad genera subalterna redacti, speciebus ultra LX determinati}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?PPN367246287 |author=C. Clerck |year=1757 |title=Svenska Spindlar uti sina hufvud-slågter indelte samt under några och sextio särskildte arter beskrefne och med illuminerade figurer uplyste / Aranei Svecici, descriptionibus et figuris æneis illustrati, ad genera subalterna redacti, speciebus ultra LX determinati |pages=[1-8], 1-154, pl. 1-6 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Laurentius Salvius}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Swedish spiders into their main genera separated, and as sixty and a few particular species described and with illuminated figures illustrated") and included 162 pages of text (eight pages were unpaginated) and 6 colour plates. It was published in Swedish, with a Latin translation printed in a slightly smaller font below the Swedish text.

Clerck described in detail 67 species of Swedish spiders,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de/zooweb/servlet/AnimalBase/list/taxa?from_reference=1 AnimalBase list] of all 67 names of species established by Clerck 1757.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the first time in a zoological work consistently applied binomial nomenclature as proposed by [[Carl Linnaeus]] and used for the first time for botanical names in his 1753 work ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', and which he presented in 1758 in the 10th edition of his work ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' for more than 4,000 animal species.

''Svenska Spindlar'' is the first zoological work to make systematic use of binomial nomenclature, and the only pre-Linnaean source to be recognised as a taxonomic authority for such names.

== Presentation of the spiders ==

Clerck explained in the last (9th of the 2nd part) chapter of his work that in contrast to previous authors he used the term "spider" in the strict sense, for animals possessing eight eyes and separated [[prosoma]] and [[opisthosoma]], and that his concept of this group of animals did not include [[Opiliones]] (because they had two eyes and a broadly joined prosoma and opisthosoma) and other groups of [[arachnids]].

For all spiders Clerck used a single generic name (''[[Araneus]]''), to which was added a specific name which consisted of only one word. Each species was presented in the Swedish text with their Latin scientific names,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/16922815 |chapter=Introduction |title=Descriptive Catalogue of the Spiders of Burma based upon the Collection made by Eugene W. Oates and Preserved in the British Museum |publisher=[[British Museum (Natural History)]] |author=Eugene William Oates &amp; Tord Thorell |year=1895 |page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by detailed information containing the exact dates when he had found the animals, and a detailed description of eyes, legs and body. The differences between the sexes were also described. Each species was illustrated in impressively accurate drawings printed on coloured copper plates which were bound at the end of the volume.

==Impact and importance of the work ==
Because of the exceptionally thorough treatment of the spider species, the scientific names proposed by Clerck (which were adopted by Carl Linnaeus in his ''Systema Naturae'' in 1758 with only minor modifications) had traditionally been recognized by arachnologists as [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] and available. In 1959 the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN Commission]] decided that Clerck's work should be available for zoological nomenclature,&lt;ref name="Dir104"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] |year=1959 |title=Direction 104. Grant of the status of availability to the names published by C. A. Clerck in 1757 in the work ''Aranei Svecici'' and addition of the title of that work to the Official List of Works approved as available for use in Zoological Nomenclature |journal=[[Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature]] |volume=17 |issue=3–5 |pages=89–91 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/44459#page/111/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] did not mention Clerck's work.{{#tag:ref|The third edition of the ICZN Code (1960) restricted binomial publications to works after 1757.|group=Note}} Only after 1999 was this officially recognized in the Code.&lt;ref name="Art3.1"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] |year=1999 |title=[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] |edition=4th |isbn=0-85301-006-4 |chapter=Article 3.1 |chapterurl=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/includes/page.jsp?article=3&amp;nfv= |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that in case of doubt the spelling of a spider name as from Clerck's 1757 work has priority over that proposed by Linnaeus in 1758 (an example is ''Araneus'' instead of ''Aranea''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/11534193 |chapter=Rules of Nomenclature in Zoology |title=Natural Science |volume=8 |publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co |year=1896 |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Clerck's spiders were the first animals in modern zoology to have obtained an available scientific name in the Linnean system.&lt;ref name="Art3.1"/&gt;

== Year 1757 or 1758? ==
In the late 1800s, Clerck's 1757 work was commonly accepted as the first application of binomial nomenclature to spiders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VRnaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Transactions of the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne], Volume 13, Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyneside Naturalists' Field Club, 1896, Pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 the ICZN Commission ruled that the date 1758 should be used for Clerck's names,&lt;ref name="Dir104"/&gt; this date 1758 was repeated to apply to Clerck's names in the 4th edition of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Art3.1"/&gt;

In a complete binomial name with author and year, the year corresponds to the year of publication of the original source. Since 2000, the ICZN Code includes an exception of this very basic rule.&lt;ref name="Art21.1"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] |year=1999 |title=[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] |edition=4th |isbn=0-85301-006-4 |chapter=Article 21.1 |chapterurl=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/includes/page.jsp?article=21&amp;nfv= |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning on the new provision in the Code has been misunderstood by many researchers who believed that by setting the date for Clerck's work to 1758 (overriding its true date 1757) and the date for ''Systema Naturae'' to 1 January 1758, the priority was changed. In 2007, a case was even brought before the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|Commission]] because the researchers were no longer sure whether the generic name should be ''[[Araneus]]'' Clerck or ''Aranea'' Linnaeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=N. J. Kluge |year=2007 |title=Case 3371. Araneidae Clerck, 1758, ''Araneus'' Clerck, 1758 and ''Tegenaria'' Latreille, 1804 (Arachnida, Araneae): proposed conservation |journal=[[Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature]] |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=15–18 |url=http://www.insecta.bio.pu.ru/z/pdf/BZN64%281%29Case3371.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302010941/http://www.insecta.bio.pu.ru/z/pdf/BZN64%281%29Case3371.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their judgement the year 1758 for Clerck's ''Svenska Spindlar'' could be interpreted in a way that the Linnean work from 1 January 1758 should have priority. In 2009 the Commission saw itself forced to repeat once more, although this was already explicit in the Code's Article 3.1, that the name ''Araneus'' established by Clerck shall have priority and be used for the genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] |year=2009 |title=Opinion 2224 (Case 3371) Araneidae Clerck, 1758, ''Araneus'' Clerck, 1758 and ''Tegenaria'' Latreille, 1804 (Arachnida, Araneae): proposed conservation |journal=[[Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=192–193 |url=http://iczn.org/content/opinion-2224-case-3371-araneidae-clerck-1758-araneus-clerck-1758-and-tegenaria-latreille-180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:T F Bourdillon.jpg|thumb|Portrait from the Teak Museum, Nilambur. ]]
'''Thomas Fulton Bourdillon''' (1849 – 19 December 1930) was [[Conservator of Forests]] in the princely state of [[Travancore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary: T. F. Bourdillon|journal=Nature|volume=127|issue=3192|page=29|year=1931|doi=10.1038/127029a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v127/n3192/abs/127029a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He came to Travancore (at present Southern Kerala) as a planter in 1871 and was appointed by the Travancore Durbar in 1886 as a special forest officer to explore the forests and to report on their resources. In 1891 he was appointed as Conservator of Forests, a position he retained till his retirement in June 1908. He was a keen botanist and an all-round forest officer. During his period, he brought the Department to a high state of efficiency.

In 1908, he authored the first book on the trees of the region ''The Forest Trees of Travancore''. In 1901 he was admitted a Fellow of the Linnean Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/proceedingsoflin18981902linn|title=Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London : Linnean Society of London : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive|work=Internet Archive|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote about bird life to [[Allan Octavian Hume]] and contributed many articles on forestry to the ''Indian Forester''. He worked in close association with other naturalists of his time including [[Richard Henry Beddome|R. H. Beddome]] and [[Harold S. Ferguson]].

Today there exists in [[Arienkavu]] on the northern side of [[Shendurney]] valley a place called Bourdillon's Plot which was the location of the first plot where [[teak]] was planted using stumps in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keralaforest.org/html/general/index.htm |title=Kerala Forest|publisher=Keralaforest.org|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was developed to grow teak sustainably for the needs of the navy. This attempt to grow teak for the needs of the [[Royal Navy]] was started by Mr. [[Henry Valentine Conolly|H. V. Conolly]], the then Collector of Malabar.

The tree species Aglaia bourdillonii, bird subspecies [[great eared-nightjar]] ''Eurostopodus macrotis bourdilloni'' and the [[Common blackbird|blackbird]] ''Turdus merula bourdilloni'' are named after him.

There have been two '''Tokaimura nuclear accidents''' at the nuclear facility at [[Tōkai, Ibaraki]]: on 11 March 1997, an explosion occurred in a [[Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation|Dōnen]] plant, and 
on 30 September 1999, a serious [[criticality accident]] happened in a [[JCO (company)|JCO]] plant.

==In 1997==
{{See also|Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation}}

The first Tokaimura nuclear accident was the accident which occurred on 11 March 1997, in a nuclear reprocessing plant of the Dōnen ([[Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation]]). Another name is the {{nihongo|'''Dōnen accident'''|動燃事故|Dōnen jiko}}.

On the night of Tuesday 11 March 1997, a small explosion occurred in a nuclear reprocessing plant of the Dōnen. Windows were smashed and smoke escaped to the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fires damage Japanese nuclear facility, Tokaimura (1997) - on Newspapers.com|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2977418/fires_damage_japanese_nuclear_facility/|website = Newspapers.com|accessdate = 2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Thursday, workers repaired thirty broken windows and three doors with duct tape. They had been damaged during the blast. At least 37 workers were exposed to elevated levels of radiation during the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan acknowledges delays in dealing with accident at nuclear power plant, Tokaimura (1997) - on Newspapers.com|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2977432/japan_acknowledges_delays_in_dealing/|website = Newspapers.com|accessdate = 2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week after the event, meteorological officials detected unusually high levels of [[caesium]] {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off|sp=us}} south-west of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Greater radiation leak hinted -  Tokaimura nuclear accident, Japan (1997) - on Newspapers.com|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2977436/greater_radiation_leak_hinted/|website = Newspapers.com|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In 1999==
The second and more serious Tokaimura nuclear accident ({{lang-ja|東海村JCO臨界事故}} ''Tōkai-mura JCO-rinkai-jiko'') indicates the [[nuclear disaster]] which occurred on 30 September 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Timeline: Nuclear plant accidents|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5165736.stm|newspaper=BBC News  |date=11 July 2006|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tokaimura: One year on|author=Charles Scanlon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/949732.stm|newspaper=BBC News  |date=30 September 2000|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuclear accident shakes Japan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/461446.stm|newspaper=BBC News  |date=30 September 1999|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in two deaths.&lt;ref name="Newfoundland"/&gt; It was the worst civilian nuclear [[radiation]] accident in Japan prior to the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] of 2011.

The [[criticality accident]] occurred in a [[uranium]] reprocessing facility operated by [[JCO (company)|JCO]] (formerly Japan Nuclear Fuel Conversion Co.), a subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. in the village of [[Tōkai, Ibaraki|Tōkai]], [[Naka District, Ibaraki|Naka District]], [[Ibaraki Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="Criticality"&gt;[http://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/tokaimura-criticality-accident.aspx Tokaimura Criticality Accident]&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident occurred as three workers, Hisashi Ouchi, Masato Shinohara, and Yutaka Yokokawa,&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/libraries/projects/cases/tokaimura/tokaimura.html|title=The Tokaimura Accident: Nuclear Energy and Reactor Safety|author=Michael E.

It was JCO's first batch of fuel for that reactor in three years, and no proper qualification and training requirements appear to have been established to prepare those workers for the job. At around 10:35, a precipitation tank reached [[critical mass]] when its fill level, containing about {{convert|16|kg|lb|abbr=off}} of uranium, reached about {{convert|40|L|USgal|abbr=off|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Criticality"/&gt;

===Details===

Criticality was reached upon the technicians adding a seventh bucket of an aqueous [[uranyl nitrate]] solution to the tank. The nuclear fission chain reaction became self-sustaining and began to emit intense [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[neutron radiation]].  At the time of the criticality event, Ouchi had his body draped over the tank while Shinohara stood on a platform to pour the solution into it; Yokokawa was sitting at a desk four meters away.  All three technicians observed a blue flash (possibly [[Cherenkov radiation]]) &lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not replace “Cherenkov radiation” with “ionized air”.

 --&gt;

Technicians Ouchi and Shinohara immediately experienced pain, nausea, difficulty breathing, and other symptoms. Ouchi then began to vomit in the decontamination room a few minutes later and lost consciousness shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency: “Report on the preliminary fact finding mission following the accident at the nuclear fuel processing facility in Tokaimura, Japan”, 1999 (See ''External links'', below).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuclear fission product|Fission products]] such as [[Isotopes of yttrium|yttrium{{nbhyph}}94]] and [[Isotopes of barium|barium{{nbhyph}}140]] began contaminating the building.

Being a wet process with an intended liquid result, the water sustained the chain reaction by serving as a [[neutron moderator]], whereby neutrons emitted from fissioned nuclei are slowed so they are more readily absorbed by neighboring nuclei, inducing them to fission in turn. The criticality continued intermittently for about 20 hours. As the solution boiled vigorously, steam bubbles attenuated the liquid water's action as a neutron moderator (see ''[[Void coefficient]]''&amp;thinsp;) and the solution lost criticality. However, the reaction resumed as the solution cooled and the voids disappeared. 

The following morning, workers permanently stopped the reaction by draining water from a cooling jacket surrounding the precipitation tank since that water was serving as a [[neutron reflector]]. A [[boric acid]] solution ([[boron]] being a good neutron absorber) was then added to the tank to ensure that the contents remained subcritical. These operations exposed 27 workers to radioactivity.&lt;ref name="Criticality"/&gt;

===Cause===
The cause of the accident was the workers adding a uranyl nitrate solution which contained about 16&amp;nbsp;kg of uranium into the precipitation tank. This greatly exceeded the tank's uranium limit of 2.4&amp;nbsp;kg and caused an instantaneous and uncontrolled nuclear fission. Under correct procedures, the uranyl nitrate would have been stored inside a buffer tank and then pumped from there into the precipitation tank at intervals of the correct volume level not exceeding 2.4&amp;nbsp;kg. 

In this case, the workers bypassed using any buffer tanks entirely and instead poured the uranyl nitrate directly into the precipitation tank with a stainless steel bucket rather than using a pump. The buffer tank would have actually held this solution safely, as it had a tall and narrow geometry and was designed to prevent criticality. The precipitation tank however had not been designed to hold this type of solution and was not configured to prevent criticality.&lt;ref name=Ryan /&gt;

===Evacuation===
Five hours after the start of the criticality, evacuation commenced of some 161 people from 39 households within a 350-meter radius from the conversion building. Residents were allowed home two days later with sandbags and other shielding to protect from residual gamma radiation. Twelve hours after the start of the incident residents within 10&amp;nbsp;km were asked to stay indoors as a precautionary measure, and this restriction was lifted the following afternoon.&lt;ref name="Criticality"/&gt;

===Aftermath===
Dozens of emergency workers and nearby residents were hospitalized and hundreds of thousands of others were forced to remain indoors for 24 hours; 39 of the workers were exposed to the radiation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicstoday.org/dec99/toka1.htm  In The Wake of Tokaimura, Japan Rethinks its Nuclear Picture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120049/http://www.physicstoday.org/dec99/toka1.htm |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 667 workers, emergency responders, and nearby residents were exposed to excess radiation as a result of the accident.&lt;ref name="Newfoundland"/&gt;

By measuring the concentration of [[sodium-24]], created by a [[neutron activation]] whereby sodium-23 nuclei were rendered radioactive by absorbing neutrons from the accident, it was possible to deduce the dose received by the technicians.  According to the STA, Hisashi Ouchi was exposed to 17 [[sievert]]s (Sv) of radiation, Masato Shinohara received 10&amp;nbsp;Sv, and Yutaka Yokokawa 3&amp;nbsp;Sv.&lt;ref name="Newfoundland"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ryan /&gt;  By comparison, a dose of .05 sieverts is the maximum allowable annual dose for Japanese nuclear workers.&lt;ref name="Criticality"/&gt; A dose of 8&amp;nbsp;Sv (800&amp;nbsp;[[Roentgen equivalent man|rem]]) is normally fatal and more than 10&amp;nbsp;Sv almost invariably so.&lt;ref name=Ryan /&gt;  Normal background radiation amounts to an annual exposure of about 3&amp;nbsp;mSv (millisieverts).&lt;ref name="Newfoundland"/&gt; There were 56 plant workers whose exposures ranged up to 23&amp;nbsp;mSv and a further 21 workers received elevated doses when draining the precipitation tank. Seven workers immediately outside the plant received doses estimated at 6-15&amp;nbsp;mSv (combined neutron and gamma effects).&lt;ref name="Criticality"/&gt;

The two technicians who received the higher doses, Ouchi and Shinohara, died several months later. Ouchi suffered serious burns to most of his body, experienced severe damage to his internal organs, and had a near-zero white blood cell count.&lt;ref name="Newfoundland"/&gt; Shinohara received numerous skin grafts, which were successful, but he ultimately succumbed to infection due to the damage his immune system sustained in the incident. Ouchi died on December 21, 1999, while Shinohara died on April 27, 2000. 

The cause of the accident was said to be "[[human error]] and serious breaches of safety principles", according to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref name="Criticality"/&gt;

In September 2000 JCO agreed to pay $121 million in compensation to settle 6,875 claims from people exposed to radiation and affected agricultural and service businesses.&lt;ref name=safetyonline-20010424/&gt;

In April 2001 six employees, including the plant administrator and accident survivor Yutaka Yokokawa, plead guilty to a charge of negligence resulting in death. The JCO President also plead guilty on behalf of the company. The court heard that a 1995 safety committee had approved the use of buckets in the procedure, and a widely distributed but unauthorised 1996 manual recommended the use of buckets in making the solution. A Science and Technology Agency report indicated JCO management had since 1993 permitted the use of a stainless steel bucket as a shortcut in the process, even though it was contrary to written procedures.&lt;ref name=safetyonline-20010424&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.safetyonline.com/doc/jco-employees-plead-guilty-to-negligence-in-d-0001 |title=JCO employees plead guilty to negligence in deaths at Japanese nuclear facility |last=Smith |first=Sandy |website=Safety Online |date=24 April 2001 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chicagotribune-20001013&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-10-13/news/0010130205_1_nuclear-facilities-nuclear-accident-nuclear-fuel-processing-plant |title=6 Arrested In Japan's '99 Nuclear Accident |last=Schmetzer |first=Uli |website=Chicago Tribune |date=13 October 2000 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|Mounting of a [[steam turbine]] produced by [[Siemens]], Germany]]
'''Turbomachinery''', in [[mechanical engineering]], describes [[machine]]s that transfer [[energy]] between a [[rotor (turbine)|rotor]] and a [[fluid]], including both [[turbines]] and [[gas compressor|compressors]].  While a turbine transfers energy from a fluid to a rotor, a compressor transfers energy from a rotor to a fluid.&lt;ref name="Logan1"&gt;Logan, Earl. "Handbook of turbomachinery". 1995. Marcel Deckker.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamili1"&gt;Vandad Talimi (Original author unknown). "Mechanical Equipment and Systems". 2013. Memorial University of Newfoundland. http://www.engr.mun.ca/~yuri/Courses/MechanicalSystems/Turbomachinery.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These two types of machines are governed by the same basic relationships including [[Newton's Laws of Motion|Newton's second Law of Motion]] and [[Euler's pump and turbine equation]] for [[compressible fluid]]s.  [[Centrifugal pump]]s are also turbomachines that transfer energy from a rotor to a fluid, usually a liquid, while turbines and compressors usually work with a gas.&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;

== History ==
The first use of turbomachines were technically water wheels between the 3rd and 1st century BCE, credited to the people in the Mediterranean region (see more at [[water wheel]]). The first real modern turbomachines did not appear until the late 1880s. It was not until the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]], however, [[steam power]] started to be utilized with [[reciprocating engine]]s and turbines, which opened up the potential of steam power. The first impulse type turbine was created by Carl Gustaf de Laval in 1883. This was closely followed by the first practical reaction type turbine in 1884, built by [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]]. Parsons’ first design was a multi-stage axial-flow unit, which [[George Westinghouse]] acquired and began manufacturing in 1895, while [[General Electric]] acquired de Laval’s designs in 1897. Since then, development has skyrocketed from Parsons’ early design, producing 0.746&amp;nbsp;kW, to modern nuclear steam turbines producing upwards of 1500 MW. Today, steam turbines account for roughly 90% of electrical power generated in the United States. The first patents for gas turbines were filed in 1791 by [[John Barber (engineer)|John Barber]]. Then the first functioning industrial gas turbines were used in the late 1890s to power street lights (Meher-Homji, 2000).

==Classification==
[[File:SteamTurbine.jpg|thumb|A steam turbine from [[MAN SE]] subdidiary MAN Turbo]]
In general, the two kinds of turbomachines encountered in practice are open and closed turbomachines. Open machines such as [[propeller]]s, [[windmill]]s, and unshrouded [[mechanical fan|fan]]s act on an infinite extent of fluid, whereas closed machines operate on a finite quantity of fluid as it passes through a housing or casing.&lt;ref name="Tamili1" /&gt;

Turbomachines are also categorized according to the type of flow. When the flow is parallel to the [[axis of rotation]], they are called axial flow machines, and when flow is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, they are referred to as radial (or centrifugal) flow machines. There is also a third category, called mixed flow machines, where both radial and axial flow velocity components are present.&lt;ref name="Tamili1" /&gt;

Turbomachines may be further classified into two additional categories: those that absorb energy to increase the [[fluid pressure]], i.e. [[pump]]s, [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]], and [[Gas compressor|compressors]], and those that produce energy such as [[turbine]]s by expanding flow to lower pressures. Of particular interest are applications which contain pumps, fans, compressors and turbines. These components are essential in almost all mechanical equipment systems, such as power and [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration cycles]].&lt;ref name="Tamili1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bask1"&gt;Baskharone, E. A. "Principles of Turbomachinery in Air-Breathing Engines". 2006. Cambridge University Press. 580 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turbomachines ==

===Definition===
Any device that extracts energy from or imparts energy to a continuously moving stream of fluid can be called a turbomachine. Elaborating, a turbomachine is a power or head generating machine which employs the dynamic action of a rotating element, the rotor; the action of the rotor changes the energy level of the continuously flowing fluid through the machine. Turbines, compressors and fans are all members of this family of machines.&lt;ref name="Raja1"&gt;Rajadurai, J. S. "Thermodynamics and thermal engineering". 2003. New Age International. {{ISBN|81-224-1493-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to positive displacement machines (particularly of the reciprocating type which are low speed machines based on the mechanical and volumetric efficiency considerations), the majority of turbomachines run at comparatively higher speeds without any mechanical problems and volumetric efficiency close to one hundred percent.&lt;ref name="SOCO1"&gt;"Combining Support Vector Machines and Segmentation Algorithms for Efficient Anomaly Detection: A Petroleum Industry Application". International Joint Conference SOCO’14-CISIS’14-ICEUTE’14. 2014. pp.269-278. {{ISBN|978-3-319-07995-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categorization===

====Energy conversion====
Turbomachines can be categorized on the basis of the direction of energy conversion:&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamili1" /&gt;

* Absorb power to increase the fluid pressure or head (ducted Fans, compressors and pumps).
* Produce power by expanding fluid to a lower pressure or head (hydraulic, steam and gas turbines).

====Fluid flow====
Turbomachines can be categorized on the basis of the nature of flow path through the passage of the rotor:&lt;ref name="Mobil1"&gt;Wills, J. George. "Lubrication fundamentals". 1980. Mobil oil corporation. Marcel Dekker. 460 pages. {{ISBN|0-8247-6976-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Axial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram.svg|thumb|centre|Axial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;]]
''[[Axial flow|Axial flow turbomachines]]'' - When the path of the through-flow is wholly or mainly parallel to the axis of rotation, the device is termed an axial flow turbomachine.&lt;ref name="Dixon1"&gt;Dixon, S. L. "Fluid mechanics and thermodynamics of turbomachinery". 1998. Elsevier. 460 pages. {{ISBN|0-7506-7870-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radial component of the fluid velocity is negligible. Since there is no change in the direction of the fluid, several axial stages can be used to increase power output.

A [[Kaplan turbine]] is an example of an axial flow turbine.

In the figure:
*U = Blade velocity,
*V&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = Flow velocity,
*V = Absolute velocity,
*V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = Relative velocity,
*V&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = Tangential or Whirl component of velocity.
[[File:Radial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram.svg|thumb|centre|Radial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;]]
''[[Radial turbine|Radial flow turbomachines]]'' - When the path of the throughflow is wholly or mainly in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, the device is termed a radial flow turbomachine.&lt;ref name="Dixon1" /&gt; Therefore, the change of radius between the entry and the exit is finite. A Radial turbomachine can be inward or outward flow type depending on the purpose that needs to be served. Outward flow type increases the energy level of the fluid and vice versa. Due to continuous change in direction, several radial stages are generally not used.

A [[centrifugal pump]] is an example of a radial flow turbomachine.

''[[Mixed flow compressor|Mixed flow turbomachines]]'' – When axial and radial flow are both present and neither is negligible, the device is termed a mixed flow turbomachine.&lt;ref name="Dixon1" /&gt; It combines flow and force components of both radial and axial types.

A [[Francis turbine]] is an example of a mixed-flow turbine.

====Physical action====
Turbomachines can finally be classified on the relative magnitude of the pressure changes that take place across a stage:&lt;ref name="Tamili1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bask1" /&gt;

[[File:An Impulse Turbomachine Stage.svg|thumb|centre|An Impulse Turbomachine Stage&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;]]
''Impulse Turbomachines'' operate by accelerating and changing the flow direction of fluid through a stationary [[nozzle]] (the stator blade) onto the rotor blade. The nozzle serves to change the incoming pressure into velocity, the [[enthalpy]] of the fluid decreases as the velocity increases. Pressure and enthalpy drop over the rotor blades is minimal. Velocity will decrease over the rotor.&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dixon1" /&gt;

[[Newton's second law]] describes the transfer of energy. Impulse turbomachines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blading on the rotor.

A [[Pelton wheel]] is an impulse design.

[[File:A Reaction Turbomachine Stage.svg|thumb|centre|A Reaction Turbomachine Stage&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;]]
''Reaction Turbomachines'' operate by reacting to the flow of fluid through aerofoil shaped rotor and stator blades. The velocity of the fluid through the sets of blades increases slightly (as with a nozzle) as it passes from rotor to stator and vice versa. The velocity of the fluid then decreases again once it has passed between the gap. Pressure and enthalpy consistently decrease through the sets of blades.&lt;ref name="Logan1" /&gt;

[[Newton's third law]] describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently.

Most turbomachines use a combination of impulse and reaction in their design, often with impulse and reaction parts on the same blade.

==Dimensionless ratios to describe turbomachinery==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
[[File:Walchenseewerk Pelton 120.jpg|thumb|[[Pelton wheel]] being installed into [[Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station]].]]
The following dimensionless ratios are often used for the characterisation of fluid machines.  They allow a comparison of flow machines with different dimensions and boundary conditions.
#Pressure range '''ψ'''
#Flow coefficient '''φ''' (including delivery or volume number called)
#Performance numbers '''λ'''
#Run number '''σ'''
#Diameter Number '''δ'''

== Applications ==

=== Power Generation ===
[[Hydroelectricity|'''Hydro electric''']]- Hydro-electric turbomachinery uses potential energy stored in water to flow over an open impeller to turn a generator which creates electricity

[[Steam turbine|'''Steam turbines''']]- Steam turbines used in power generation come in many different variations. The overall principle is high pressure steam is forced over blades attached to a shaft, which turns a generator. As the steam travels through the turbine, it passes through smaller blades causing the shaft to spin faster, creating more electricity.

[[Gas turbine|'''Gas turbines''']]- Gas turbines work much like steam turbines. Air is forced in through a series of blades that turn a shaft. Then fuel is mixed with the air and causes a combustion reaction, increasing the power. This then causes the shaft to spin faster, creating more electricity.

[[Wind turbine|'''Windmills''']]- Also known as a wind turbine, windmills are increasing in popularity for their ability to efficiently use the wind to generate electricity. Although they come in many shapes and sizes, the most common one is the large three-blade. The blades work on the same principle as an airplane wing. As wind passes over the blades, it creates an area of low and high pressure, causing the blade to move, spinning a shaft and creating electricity. It is most like a steam turbine, but work with an infinite supply of wind.

=== Marine ===
'''Steam turbine'''- Steam turbines in marine applications are very similar to those in power generation. The few differences between them are size and power output. Steam turbines on ships are much smaller because they don’t need to power a whole town. They aren’t very common because of their high initial cost, high specific fuel consumption, and expensive machinery that goes with it.

'''Gas turbines'''- Gas turbines in marine applications are becoming more popular due to their smaller size, increased efficiency, and ability to burn cleaner fuels. They run just like gas turbines for power generation, but are also much smaller and do require more machinery for propulsion. They are most popular in naval ships as they can be at a dead stop to full power in minutes (Kayadelen, 2013), and are much smaller for a given amount of power.
Flow of air through a turbocharger and engine

'''[[Pump-jet|Water jet]]-''' Essentially a waterjet drive is like an aircraft turbojet with the difference that the operating fluid is water instead of air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.castoldijet.it/en/waterjet_en/waterjet_drive_propulsion_systems.html|title=Waterjet drives propulsion systems|website=www.castoldijet.it|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water jets are best suited to fast vessels and are thus used often by the military. Water jet propulsion has many advantages over other forms of marine propulsion, such as stern drives, outboard motors, shafted propellers and surface drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hamiltonjet.com/global/waterjet-overview|title=WaterJet Overview|date=2015-03-18|work=HamiltonJet|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auto ===
[[File:Turbocharger Animation by Tyroola.gif|thumb|Air and exhaust flow through engine and turbocharger]]
[[Turbocharger|'''Turbochargers''']]- Turbochargers are one of the most popular turbomachines. They are used mainly for adding power to engines by adding more air. It combines both forms of turbomachines. Exhaust gases from the engine spin a bladed wheel, much like a turbine. That wheel then spins another bladed wheel, sucking and compressing outside air into the engine.

[[Supercharger|'''Superchargers''']]- Superchargers are used for engine-power enhancement as well, but only work off the principle of compression. They use the mechanical power from the engine to spin a screw or vein, some way to suck in and compress the air into the engine.

=== General ===
[[Pump|'''Pumps''']]- Pumps are another very popular turbomachine. Although there are very many different types of pumps, they all do the same thing. Pumps are used to move fluids around using some sort of mechanical power, from electric motors to full size diesel engines. Pumps have thousands of uses, and are the true basis to turbomachinery (Škorpík, 2017).

[[Air compressor|'''Air compressors''']]- Air compressors are another very popular turbomachine. They work on the principle of compression by sucking in and compressing air into a holding tank. Air compressors are one of the most basic turbomachines.

'''[[Mechanical fan|Fans]]'''- Fans are the most general type of turbomachines. They work opposite of wind turbines. Mechanical power spins the blades, forcing air through them and forcing out. Basic desk-top fans to large turbofan airplane engines work this way.

=== Aerospace ===
'''Gas turbines'''- Aerospace gas turbines, more commonly known as jet engines, are the most common gas turbines. They are the most like power generation turbines because the electricity used on the airplane is from the turbines, while also providing the propulsion. These turbines are the smallest out of the industrial turbines, and are most often the most advanced.

==Partial list of turbomachine topics==
Many types of dynamic continuous flow turbomachinery exist.  Below is a partial list of these types.  What is notable about these turbomachines is that the same fundamentals apply to all.  Certainly there are significant differences between these machines and between the types of analysis that are typically applied to specific cases.  This does not negate the fact that they are unified by the same underlying physics of fluid dynamics, gas dynamics, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics.

==Related notions==
The term "sag" should not be confused with [[brownout (electricity)|brownout]] which is the reduction of voltage for minutes or hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Standler|first=Ronald B.|title=Protection of electronic circuits from overvoltages|year=1989|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471611219|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "transient" as used in [[power quality]] is an [[umbrella term]] and can refer to sags, but also to swells, dropouts, etc.&lt;ref name="VedamSarma2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=R. Sastry Vedam|author2=Mulukutla S. Sarma|title=Power Quality: VAR Compensation in Power Systems|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-6482-7|pages=4–5 and 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swell==
'''Voltage swell''' is the opposite of voltage sag. Voltage swell, which is a momentary increase in voltage, happens when a heavy load turns off in a power system.&lt;ref name=Kazibwe&gt;{{cite book|last=Kazibwe|first=Wilson E.|title=Electric power quality control techniques|year=1993|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|location=New York|isbn=978-0-442-01093-5|page=11|author2=Sendaula, Musoke H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
There are several factors which cause a voltage sag to happen:
* Since the electric motors draw more current when they are starting than when they are running at their rated speed, starting an electric motor can be a reason of a voltage sag.&lt;ref name=Bollen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kazibwe/&gt;
* When a line-to-ground fault occurs, there will be a voltage sag until the protective switch gear operates.&lt;ref name=Bollen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kazibwe/&gt;
* Some accidents in [[power line]]s such as [[lightning]] or a falling object can be a cause of line-to-ground fault and a voltage sag as a result.&lt;ref name=Kazibwe/&gt;
* Sudden load changes or excessive loads can cause a voltage sag.&lt;ref name=Kazibwe/&gt;
* Depending on the [[transformer]] connections, transformers energizing could be another reason for voltage sags happening.&lt;ref name=Teodorescu/&gt;
* Voltage sags can arrive from the utility but most are caused by in-building equipment. In residential homes, voltage sags are sometimes seen when refrigerators, air-conditioners, or furnace fans start up.
