He was highly influential author of literary criticism in [[Telugu language]]. 

He practiced [[Sanskrit]] grammar and logic as language options by follow the navadweepa tradition.  Because of companionship with literary writers, he started to look for his mother tongue based on the wisdom of his knowledge of the wisdom of curious literature.

He was the editor of the magazine "Trilinga" which was stated in 1916 by [[vavikolanu subbarao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04tDyxmNOhsC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Akkiraju+umakantam#v=onepage&amp;q=Akkiraju%2520umakantam&amp;f=false |title=The Great Indian Patriots |last=Rao |first=P.

In 1910 he published ''Trilinga Kathalu'', and in 1911 he collected the copies of ''Palnati Veeracharitra'' and published them after editing. Based the stories of warriors of palnadu he has written book ''Palnati Veerula Kathalu'', the stories of warriors in palnadu. He has written ''Netikalapu Kavitwam'' which criticised the lack of standards in [[modernist poetry]]. He was not only the critic but also a famous writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~adluri/telugu/modern/people/akkiraju_umakantam.html |title=akkiraaju umaakaantaM |website=www.engr.mun.ca |access-date=2017-09-01}}{{SPS|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His famous novel based on the biography of ''Tippu Sulthan'' in 1913.

'''Basque dialects''' are linguistic varieties of the [[Basque language]] which differ in pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar from each other and from [[Standard Basque]]. Between six&lt;ref name=Euskalkiz&gt;Pagola, RM ''Euskalkiz Euskalki'' [[Basque Government]] 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and nine&lt;ref name="Trask"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Basque|last=Trask|first=R. L.|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1997|isbn=0-415-13116-2|location=|pages=|author-link=Larry Trask}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basque dialects have been historically distinguished:

*[[Biscayan dialect|Biscayan]]
*[[Gipuzkoan dialect|Gipuzkoan]]
*[[Upper Navarrese dialect|Upper Navarrese (Northern and Southern)]]
*[[Lower Navarrese dialect|Lower Navarrese (Eastern and Western)]]
*[[Lapurdian dialect|Lapurdian]]
*[[Souletin dialect|Souletin (Souletin and Roncalese)]]

In modern times, however, both Lower Navarrese and Lapurdian are considered part of a Navarrese–Lapurdian dialect, so there would be five dialects, divided into 11 subdialects and 24 minor varieties.&lt;ref name=Zuazo2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=El euskera y sus dialectos|year=2010|publisher=Alberdania|isbn=978-84-9868-202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PrerromanosN.png|thumb|right|The pre-Roman tribal boundaries in the general area of the modern-day Basque Country.]]
The boundaries of all these dialects do not coincide directly with current political or administrative boundaries. It was believed that the dialect boundaries between Bizkaian, Gipuzkoan and Upper Navarrese showed some relation to some pre-Roman tribal boundaries between the [[Caristii]], [[Varduli]] and [[Vascones]]. However, main Basque dialectologists now deny any direct relation between those tribes and Basque dialects. It seems that these dialects were created in the [[Middle Ages]] from a previously quite unified Basque language, and the dialects diverged from each other since then as a result of the administrative and political division that happened in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]].&lt;ref name=Zuazo2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitxelena|first=Koldo|title=Lengua común y dialectos vascos|journal=Anuario del Seminario de Filología Vasca Julio de Urquijo|year=1981|issue=15|pages=291–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Basque dialectology==
[[File:Bonaparte euskalki mapa.jpg|thumb|Louis-Lucien Bonaparte's original 1866 map of Basque dialects.]]
[[File:Euskalkien mapa (1998).jpg|thumb|Map of Basque dialects (Koldo Zuazo, 1998)]]
One of the first scientific studies of Basque dialects, regarding the [[auxiliary verb]] forms, was made by [[Louis-Lucien Bonaparte]], a nephew of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. His original dialect map, ''Carte des Sept Provinces Basques'', was published in 1869 along with his ''Le Verbe Basque en Tableaux'' was regarded as the authoritative guide in Basque dialectology for a century. He collected his data in fieldwork between 1856 and 1869 in five visits to the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. By then, the Basque language was in retreat throughout the territory in which it had been commonly spoken. In [[Álava]], Basque had all but vanished from the Plains and the Highlands, remaining only in the stronghold of [[Aramaio]] and bordering fringes of [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]], while in [[Navarre]] the scholar collected the last live evidence in areas extending as far south as [[Tafalla]].
        
In 1998, [[Koldo Zuazo]], Professor of Basque Philology at the [[University of the Basque Country]], redefined the dialect classifications slightly. For example, he changed the name of Biscayan to Western, Gipuzkoan to Central, Upper Navarrese to Navarrese. He also grouped Lapurdian with Lower Navarrese, distinguished Eastern Navarrese as an independent dialect, and recognised several mixed areas:
*[[Biscayan dialect|Western (Biscayan)]]
*[[Gipuzkoan dialect|Central (Gipuzkoan)]]
*[[Upper Navarrese dialect|(Upper) Navarrese]]
*[[Eastern Navarrese]] (including [[Salazarese]] and the extinct [[Roncalese]])
*[[Lapurdian dialect|Navarrese–Lapurdian]]
*[[Souletin dialect|Souletin]]

Much has been studied too on the Basque dialect spoken formerly in Álava. In 1997, Zuazo released research carried out on the issue based on dispersed recorded evidence (such as Landuchio's glossary) and papers drawn up especially by [[Koldo Mitxelena]]. The pundit outlines three main linguistic areas running north to south, where features related to Western and Navarrese dialects mix up to different degrees according to their geographical position.

He focuses mainly on relevant lexico-morphological differences, such as instrumental declension marks -gaz/rekin, ablative -rean/tik, b'''a'''rria/b'''e'''rria (= 'new'), el'''ex'''ea/el'''iz'''ea (= 'church'), '''p'''adura/'''m'''adura (= 'swamp'), to mention but a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Zuazo, Koldo | year = 1998 | title = ''Arabako Euskararen Lekukoak; Ikerketak eta Testuak''. Arabako Euskara | publisher = Eusko Legebiltzarra/Parlamento Vasco | location= Vitoria-Gasteiz | isbn = 84-87122-73-6 | page = 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key distinguishing features in Basque dialect phonology include:
*loss of {{IPA|/h/}} and aspirated stops in Southern Basque dialects
*divergence of historic {{IPA|/j/}} into {{IPA|/j/ /ɟ/ /ʒ/ /ʃ/ /x/ /χ/}}&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt;
*Souletin development of the vowel {{IPA|/y/}}

==Morphological variation==
Modern Basque dialects show a high degree of dialectal divergence. However, cross-dialectal communication without prior knowledge of either [[Standard Basque]] or the other dialect is normally possible to a reasonable extent, with the notable of exception of Zuberoan (also called [[Souletin]]), which is regarded as the most divergent Basque dialect.

The names for the language in the dialects of Basque (''Euskara'' in Standard Basque) for example exemplify to some degree the dialectal fragmentation of the Basque speaking area. The most divergent forms are generally found in the Eastern dialects.

Basque dialects all diverge from this standard inventory to a larger or lesser extent. The [[grapheme]] ''j'' (historically /j/) displays by far the most noticeable divergence, followed by the fricatives and affricates. Hualde (1991) describes the following:
* [[Baztan (valley)|Baztan]], an [[Eastern Navarrese]] dialect: lack of /x/
* [[Arbizu]], a dialect in a mixed [[Gipuzkoan]]/[[Western Navarrese]] dialect area: geminate vowels /i/~/ii/, /e/~/ee/, /a/~/aa/, /o/~/oo/, /u/~/uu/
* [[Gernika]], a [[Biscayan]] dialect: merger of /s̻/ with /s̺/ and /ts̻/ with /ts̺/. Additional phonemes: /ʒ/. Lack of /c/ and /ɟ/.
* [[Ondarroa]], a [[Biscayan]] dialect: merger of /s̻/ with /s̺/ and /ts̻/ with /ts̺/. Additional phonemes: /dz/. Lack of /c/ and /ɟ/.

==Standardized dialects==
There have been various attempts throughout history to promote standardised forms of Basque dialects to the level of a common standard Basque.

*A standardised form of Lower Navarrese was the dialect used by influential 16th-century author [[Joanes Leizarraga]].
*[[Resurrección María de Azkue|Azkue]]'s [[Gipuzkera Osotua]] ("Complemented Gipuzkoan"), dating to 1935, attempted, though largely unsuccessfully, to create a standardized Basque based on Gipuzkoan, complemented with elements from other dialects.
*In the 1940s, a group called ''Jakintza Baitha'' ("Wisdom House") gathered around the academician [[Federico Krutwig]], who preferred to base the standard on the [[Lapurdian]] of [[Joanes Leizarraga]]'s Protestant Bible and the first printed books in Basque. However, they did not receive support from other Basque language scholars and activists.
*In 1944, [[Pierre Lafitte Ithurralde|Pierre Lafitte]] published his ''Navarro-Labourdin Littéraire'', based on [[Lapurdian|Classical Lapurdian]], which has become the [[de facto]] standard form of Lapurdian. It is taught in some schools of Lapurdi and used on radio, in church, and by the newspaper ''[[Herria]]''.
*Since 1968, Euskaltzaindia has promulgated a [[Standard Basque|Unified (or Standard) Basque (''Euskara batua'')]] based on the central dialects that has successfully spread as the formal dialect of the language. ''Batua'' is found in official texts, schools, TV, newspapers and in common parlance by new speakers, especially in the cities, whereas in the countryside, with more elderly speakers, people remain more attached to the natural dialects, especially in informal situations.
*More recently, the distinct dialects of Bizkaian and Zuberoan have also been standardised.

'''Bawm''' or '''Bawm Chin''', also known as '''Banjogi''', is a [[Kuki-Chin languages|Kuki-Chin language]] primarily spoken in Bangladesh. It is also spoken in adjacent regions of Northeast India and Burma.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sino-Tibetan Languages'' Graham Thurgood and Randy J. LaPolla&lt;/ref&gt; The Bawms that live on the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] of Bangladesh call their settlements "Bawmram", which literally means an area or location inhabited by Bawms.&lt;ref&gt;Loncheu, Nathan (2013). Dena, Lal, ed. Bawmzos: ''A Study Of The Chin-Kuki-Zo Tribes Of Chittagong''. Akansha Publishing House. {{ISBN|9788183703468}}. Retrieved 17 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mizoram]], India, Bawm Chin is spoken in [[Chhimtuipui district]], [[Lunglei district]], and [[Aizawl district]] (''[[Ethnologue]]''). It is also spoken in the states of [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]].

==General information==
Most of the Kuki-Chin communities live in Rangamati and Bandarban districts of Chittagong division in Bangladesh, with most of the Bawm community residing in the Bethel Para in Ruma subdistrict and Thanci subdistrict of the Bandarban district. Also, the Bawm reside in the Rangamati Sadar and Barkal and Bilaichari subdistricts of the Rangamati district.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Roy &amp; Sangma. 2011.  ''The Kuki-Chin Communities of Bangladesh: A sociolinguistic survey''. SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bawm language is fairly developed and contains a good amount of literature including dictionaries, religious texts, historical texts, folk stories and books such as short stories and science fiction. However, the Bawm language is at risk for endangerment. One way in which the language can prosper is through the use of multilingual education programs to ensure that the Bawm community as a whole has sufficient resources to pass the language to the next generation. The use of multilingual education programs requires the community to be educated in what types of books and literature to use.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Roy &amp; Sangma. 2011.  ''The Kuki-Chin Communities of Bangladesh: A sociolinguistic survey''. SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
In 1981, around 7,000 Bawms inhabited the hills of southeastern Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;''The Invention of the ‘Jummas': State Formation and Ethnicity in Southeastern Bangladesh'', WILLEM VAN SCHENDEL&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, around 5,000 Bawm inhabited India, with a population in all countries totaling around 16,000. In 2011, 10,000 Bawms inhabited the Chittagong hills of Bangladesh and 1,500 Bawm inhabited Myanmar. The endangerment status of the Bawm language in India and Myanmar is 6B and in Bangladesh is 5 (developing).&lt;ref&gt;Bawm at Ethnologue (17th ed., 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The language is threatened severely in India and Myanmar as the number of speakers continues to decline. In Bangladesh, the language is stable but its speakers in numbers are not increasing.

'''Bhadant Anand Kausalyayan''' (5 January 1905 – 22 June 1988) was a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, scholar, traveller and a prolific writer from India. He is considered as one of the great [[Activism|activists]] of Buddhism of the 20th century. He was influenced by the Buddhist scholar and [[Social reformers of India|social reformer]] [[Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan]] and [[B. R. Ambedkar]].

==Personal life==
Bhadant Anand Kausalyayan was born Harnam Das on 5 January 1905 in Sohana Village of [[Ambala]] District in [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]].  He did BA from National College in [[Lahore]]. His travels took him to different parts of World for promoting Buddhism like his mentor, Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan. He always wanted to have experience of travelling far distances across many countries and discover new things. His aim was to continue the tradition started by his inspirations. He is one of the pioneers of [[Indian Literature|Indian travel literature]].

==Works==
He contributed a lot to Indian travel literature and [[Hindi]]. He worked for [[Hindi]] Sahitya Sammelan, Prayag, Rastrabhasha Prachar Samiti, Vardha etc. He used very simple language in his books that everyone can easily understand. He wrote many essays, novels, books on his travel to different places. He also wrote many books on Buddhism. More than 20 of his books were published.

Ambedkar left behind lacs of Buddhist followers who were in need of strong Buddhist(religious) leader, particularly in Maharashtra. Kausalyayan travelled and guided Maharashtrian Buddhists and also translated Ambedkar's work ''The Buddha and His Dhamma'' into Hindi. He also traced and collected original resources from Pali Tripitika and other Buddhist literature, which Ambedkar had not done.

}}The '''Bullom So''' language, also called ''Mani'' or ''Mandingi'', is an [[endangered language]] currently spoken in a few villages in [[Samu Chiefdom|Samu region]] of [[Sierra Leone]]'s [[Kambia District]], near the border of [[Guinea]]. It belongs to the [[Mel languages|Mel]] branch of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] language family and is particularly closely related to the [[Bom language]]. Intermarriage between Bullom So speakers and speakers of [[Temne language|Temne]] and [[Susu language|Susu]] is common. As the few remaining speakers of Bullom So are all over 60, the language is considered [[Moribund language|moribund]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{fix|text=similar claims in Eth. 15 have been abandoned}}

== History ==
According to Childs, the Mani once occupied an area far greater than where the language is spoken today. At the start of the 18th century, the Mani kingdom stretched from Sierra-Leone to Guinea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were later replaced along the coastal region by [[Temne people|Temne-Baga]] speakers, and later by the [[Susu people|Soso]], through war, invasion and acculturation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Classification ==
The Bullom So (Mani) language is a [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] language of [[Mel languages|Mel]] subgroup. It is closely related to [[Kissi language|Kisi]], [[Sherbro language|Sherbro]], Kim and [[Bom language|Bom]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Prosody ===
The most common syllable type in Bullom So (Mani) is CV and CVC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nasals can also be syllabic, though they are relatively uncommon, much like V only syllables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Vowels are nasalised when syllable codas contain [[Nasal consonant|nasals]]. Here are some examples from Childs (2011: 37):

''Regressive Nasal Assimilation''

/wàm/ [wãm] or [wã] 'ten'

/tún/ [tũ] 'commit'

/bìn/ [bĩ] 'plank'

/nyɛ̀n/ [nyɛ̃] 'mouth'

=== Written Mani before the Twenty-First Century ===
Nyländer translated the Gospel of Matthew into Bullom So, and portions of the Bible were also included in his Book of Common Prayer.  These were published by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1816.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6912">A '''cache language model''' is a type of statistical [[language model]]. These occur in the [[natural language processing]] subfield of [[computer science]] and assign [[probability|probabilities]] to given sequences of words by means of a [[probability distribution]]. Statistical language models are key components of  [[speech recognition]] systems and of many [[machine translation]] systems: they tell such systems which possible output word sequences are probable and which are improbable. The particular characteristic of a cache language model is that it contains a [[Cache (computing)|cache component]] and assigns relatively high probabilities to words or word sequences that occur elsewhere in a given text. The primary, but by no means sole, use of cache language models is in speech recognition systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

To understand why it is a good idea for a statistical language model to contain a cache component one might consider someone who is dictating a letter about elephants to a speech recognition system. Standard (non-cache) [[N-gram]] language models will assign a very low probability to the word "elephant" because it is a very rare word in [[English language|English]]. If the speech recognition system does not contain a cache component the person dictating the letter may be annoyed: each time the word "elephant" is spoken another sequence of words with a higher probability according to the N-gram language model may be recognized (e.g., "tell a plan"). These erroneous sequences will have to be deleted manually and replaced in the text by "elephant" each time "elephant" is spoken. If the system has a cache language model, "elephant" will still probably be misrecognized the first time it is spoken and will have to be entered into the text manually; however, from this point on the system is aware that "elephant" is likely to occur again – the estimated probability of occurrence of "elephant" has been increased, making it more likely that if it is spoken it will be recognized correctly. Once "elephant" has occurred several times the system is likely to recognize it correctly every time it is spoken until the letter has been completely dictated. This increase in the probability assigned to the occurrence of "elephant" is an example of a consequence of [[machine learning]] and more specifically of [[pattern recognition]].

There exist variants of the cache language model in which not only single words but also multi-word sequences that have occurred previously are assigned higher probabilities (e.g., if "San Francisco" occurred near the beginning of the text subsequent instances of it would be assigned a higher probability).

The cache language model was first proposed in a paper published in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kuhn | first1=R. | last2=De Mori | first2=R. | authorlink1= | authorlink2=Renato de Mori | title=A Cache-Based Natural Language Model for Speech Recognition | journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence]] | date=June 1990 | volume=12 | issue=6 |pages=570–583| url=http://visgraph.cs.ust.hk/biometrics/Papers/Voice/pami1990-06-01.pdf | issn=1939-3539 | doi=10.1109/34.56193 }} ([https://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/tp/1990/06/i0570-abs.html Abstract])
&lt;/ref&gt; after which the [[IBM]] speech-recognition group experimented with the concept. The group found that implementation of a form of cache language model yielded a 24% drop in [[Word error rate|word-error rates]] once the first few hundred words of a document had been dictated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/H/H91/H91-1057.pdf | title=A Dynamic Language Model for Speech Recognition | author=F. Jelinek|author2=B. Merialdo|author3=S. Roukos|author4=M. Strauss|lastauthoramp=y | journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | year=1991 | volume=98 | issue=2 | doi=10.3115/112405.112464 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614121245/http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/H/H91/H91-1057.pdf | archivedate=June 14, 2006 | deadurl=y}} Conference: Speech and Natural Language, Proceedings of a Workshop held at Pacific Grove, California, USA, February 19–22, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed survey of language modeling techniques concluded that the cache language model was one of the few new language modeling techniques that yielded improvements over the standard N-gram approach: "Our caching results show that caching is by far the most useful technique for perplexity reduction at small and medium [[Training set|training data]] sizes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joshua T. Goodman|year=2001|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0108005.pdf|title=A Bit of Progress in Language Modeling: Extended Version|publisher=Microsoft Research|location=Redmond, WA (US)|id=Technical report MSR-TR-2001-72|arxiv=cs/0108005v1 |bibcode=2001cs........8005G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the cache language model has generated considerable interest among those concerned with [[computational linguistics]] in general and [[statistical natural language processing]] in particular: recently there has been interest in applying the cache language model in the field of statistical machine translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W10/W10-2602.pdf | title=Context Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation Using Models with Exponentially Decaying Cache | author=Tiedemann, Jorg | conference=Proceedings of the 2010 Workshop on Domain Adaptation for Natural Language Processing, ACL 2010, | year=2010 | pages=8–15 | location=Uppsala, Sweden | publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the cache language model in improving word prediction rests on the human tendency to use words in a "bursty" fashion: when one is discussing a certain topic in a certain context the frequency with which one uses certain words will be quite different from their frequencies when one is discussing other topics in other contexts. The traditional N-gram language models, which rely entirely on information from a very small number (four, three, or two) of words preceding the word to which a probability is to be assigned, do not adequately model this "burstiness".

==History==
CILLDI was established in 1999 by a collective of language advocates and educators including Donna Paskemin, Heather Blair, and Sally Rice; the first CILLDI summer institute was held on the [[Onion Lake First Nation]],  Saskatchewan and offered one course entitled "Expanding Cree Language and Literacy" with fifteen students from Alberta and Saskatchewan.&lt;ref name="CILLDI_2000"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cilldi.ualberta.ca/AboutCILLDI/History/2000.aspx |title=CIILDI History 2000|work=University of Alberta |date=2002 |accessdate=July 5, 2016 |location=Edmonton, Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2000.

According to Arden Ogg of the Cree Literacy Network, Donna Paskewin,&lt;ref name="Paskemin_2011_eulogy" /&gt;

{{quote|... was the driving force behind the inception of the Canadian Indigenous Language and Literacy Development Institute (CILLDI) in 2000 at the University of Alberta and helped guide its development as a language planner, instructor, curriculum developer, immersion teacher, and fundraiser, always consulting the Elders and following appropriate protocols. I believe that we would never have gotten the Institute off the ground had it not been for Donna’s insistence on its importance and the urgent need. Donna’s work has been the foundation of the language retention and revitalization efforts of the over 800 CILLDI students since 2000.| Arden Ogg "In Tribute" 2011}}

When Donna's young daughter Jodee Jayne attended CILLDI one summer, as the youngest attendee, Donna was motivated to organize a Cree Immersion Day camp in 2004 at CILLDI for the children of our adult students so that the language would be learned by the next generations.&lt;ref name="Blair_Paskemin"&gt;Blair, H., Paskemin, D., &amp; McGilvery, F.

===Community Linguist Certificate (CLC)===
Some CILLDI courses lead to a Community Linguist Certificate (CLC). This program provides a unique opportunity to earn university credit while learning about Indigenous languages and culture. CIILDI provides "background training in a variety of disciplines to students who may be seeking a B.A. or a B.Ed. or other advanced degree, diploma, or certificate." Through CILLDI the accredited Community Linguist Certificate (CLC) program was developed in 2007 by Sally Rice - "Professor of Linguistics at the University of Alberta and a co-founder and former director of CILLDI" - &lt;ref name="aclacaal_2016"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.aclacaal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TRC_Event_30_May_Full_Program.pdf |format=PDF |title=Towards A Living Digital Archive of Canadian Indigenous Languages |first1=Sally |last1=Rice |first2=Dorothy |last2=Thunder |conference=Conference of the Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics (CAAL) |series=Indigenous Languages and Reconciliation |date=May 30, 2016 |accessdate=July 11, 2016 |location=Calgary, Alberta}} Held during the 2016 [[Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences|Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences]]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 over 90 Indigenous language speakers in Canada had earned their CLC.&lt;ref name="aclacaal_2016"/&gt; CLC students are often "fluent speakers who may also be veteran language teachers with years of experience in the classroom but very little formal training" or "young professionals recently tasked with developing language revitalization programming in their home communities."

===A National Vision for Indigenous Language Stability (ANVILS)===

A National Vision for Indigenous Language Stability (ANVILS) is a workshop held in during CILLDI's intense summer school program at the University of Alberta. ANVIL brings together "Indigenous leaders, national and international scholars and representatives from the government to begin a national conversation about Indigenous language sustainability and preservation."

==Role==
Canadian researchers compiling a 2007 literature review of Canadian and international indigenous language learning and teaching, noted that literature published on "linguistic language theoretical and practical findings" - was more easily available to public educational institutions or libraries; but the invaluable pedagogical language strategies significant body of "pedagogical linguistic language materials" developed ''within'' First Nations communities" were known to representatives from institutes like CILLDI who worked closely with communities.&lt;ref name="Lit_Review_2007" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

[[File:Seawise University wreck.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|{{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} capsized after a fire.]]

'''Capsizing''' or '''keeling over''' occurs when a [[boat]] or [[ship]] is turned on its side or it is upside down in the water. The act of reversing a capsized vessel is called '''righting'''.
 
If a capsized vessel has enough flotation to prevent sinking, it may recover on its own if it is not [[Ship stability|stable]] inverted.  Vessels of this design are called self-righting.

==Small vessels==
In [[dinghy]] sailing, a practical distinction can be made between being knocked down (to 90 degrees) which is called a capsize, and being inverted, which is called being [[Turtling (sailing)|turtled]].  Small dinghies frequently capsize in the normal course of use and can usually be recovered by the crew.  Some types of dinghy are occasionally deliberately capsized, as capsizing and righting the vessel again can be the fastest means of draining water from the boat.

Capsizing (but not necessarily turtling) is an inherent part of dinghy sailing. It is not a question of "if" but a question of "when".&lt;ref name="discover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverboating.com/resources/article.aspx?id=255 |title=Will I capsize? |publisher=Discover Boating |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For those who do not want the experience, a [[keelboat]] [[monohull]] has physics on its side.&lt;ref name="discover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dashew"/&gt; But even [[yachts]] can capsize and turtle in extraordinary conditions, so design considerations are important.&lt;ref name="Dashew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://setsail.com/evaluating-stability-and-capsize-risks-for-yachts/ |title=Evaluating Stability and Capsize Risks for Yachts  |first1=Steve |last1=Dashew  |date=January 8, 2012 |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such events can overcome skill and experience; boats need to be appropriate for foreseeable conditions.&lt;ref name="Keilman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-10-30/news/ct-met-mackinac-race-1030-20111030_1_capsized-wingnuts-boat |title=Report: Boat in deadly accident unfit for Mackinac race {{mdash}} Craft that capsized called too unstable for long competition in area prone to severe weather |date=October 30, 2011 |first1=John |last1=Keilman |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kayak roll.gif|thumb|left|A kayak roll, after intentional capsizing]]
A capsized [[kayak]] may be righted with a [[kayak roll|roll]] or [[Eskimo Rescue|eskimo rescue]]. As long as the kayaker knows how to react, the water is not too shallow, and the location is not close to dangers that require evasive action by the kayaker – which cannot be taken while capsized – capsizing itself is usually not considered dangerous. In [[whitewater kayaking]], capsizing occurs frequently and is accepted as an ordinary part of the sport.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

For sailing vessels, the "capsize ratio" is a commonly published number used as a guideline for safe operation, where a ratio of less than 2.0 is considered suitable for offshore operation.  However the only variables that go into "capsize ratio" are a vessel's beam and its displacement, and a thorough assessment of [[ship stability]] needs to consider various other factors.

A vessel may be designated as "self-righting" if it is designed to be able to capsize then return to upright without intervention (with or without crew on board).  Most small craft intended as [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] with rigid (rather than inflatable) hulls designed since about the middle of the twentieth century are self-righting.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Large vessels==
In a storm, even large vessels may be rolled by being hit broadside by a large wave or "pitchpoled" [[Stem (ship)|stem]] over [[stern]] in extreme [[Ocean surface wave|waves]]. This is normally catastrophic for larger ships, and smaller yachts can be dismasted (i.e., lose their [[mast (sailing)|masts]] and [[rigging]]) due to the drag as the boat is forced to roll over.

Among ship types, a [[RORO|roll-on-roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ship]] is more prone to capsizing as it has large open car decks near the [[waterline]]. If the watertight car-deck doors fail through damage or mismanagement (as in the partial sinking of {{MS|Herald of Free Enterprise}} where the doors were accidentally left open), and one of the largest peacetime maritime disasters when [[MS Estonia]] sank off of the Finnish archipelago, water entering the car-deck is subject to the [[free surface effect]] and may cause a capsize. As a RORO ferry rolls, vehicles can break free and slide down if not firmly secured, adversely altering the ship's [[centre of gravity]], [[accelerating]] the roll, and possibly turning an otherwise recoverable roll into a capsize.

A ship that is holed may capsize.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/9030330/The-EU-ignored-years-of-expert-warnings-on-cruise-ship-safety.html The Telegraph: The EU ignored years of expert warnings on cruise ship safety.] Discusses stability issue when large modern ships are holed&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the very large [[cruise ship]] ''{{ship||Costa Concordia||2}}'' was holed, lost its propulsion, and drifted into shallow water where she partially sank, resting on her side with most of her structure out of the water.  Technically, this was not a capsize as her bottom was only partly exposed; rather this was a partial [[Shipwreck|sinking]].

A vessel which capsizes without being holed may allow water to enter in places normally above the waterline. The ship may not then be able to right itself; stability and safety will be compromised even if the vessel is righted.

== Competition ==
[[Image:Aus2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A team at the 2005 ISAF Team Racing World Championship narrowly avoids capsizing.]]
In competitive [[yacht racing]], a capsized boat has certain special rights as it cannot maneuver.  A boat is deemed capsized when the mast is touching the water; when it is fully inverted, it is said to have [[Turtling (sailing)|turned turtle]] or turtled.&lt;ref name="Rousmaniere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://offshore.ussailing.org/AssetFactory.aspx?vid=19214 |title=Tests of Sailor Retrieval, Capsize Recovery and Entrapment |first1=John |last1=Rousmaniere |authorlink1=John Rousmaniere |publisher=[[US Sailing]] |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203024047/http://offshore.ussailing.org/AssetFactory.aspx?vid=19214 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Good racers can often recover from a capsize with minimal loss of time.

The capsize can result from extreme [[broach (sailing)|broaching]], especially if the [[keel]] has insufficient leverage to tilt the vessel upright.

[[Motor life boat]]s are designed to be self-righting if capsized, but most other motorboats are not.

==Training==
[[File:Rejsning-af-kaentret-hobie-cat.jpg|250px|thumb|Righting a capsized [[Hobie Cat]]]]
Intermediate sailors are encouraged to capsize their dinghies in a safe location with supervision at least once to become acquainted with their boat's floating properties and the capsize process. The boat is then righted, bailed out, and the sails reset, so that in the event of an uncontrolled capsize, the boat and its occupants are familiar with the procedure and may recover.

Most small monohull sailboats can normally be righted by standing or pulling down on the [[centreboard]], [[daggerboard]] (or [[bilgeboard]] in a [[Scow#Racing boats: the inland lake scows|scow]]) to lift the mast clear of the water. Depending on the design of the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], the boat's [[righting moment]] will normally take effect once the mast is around 30 degrees from horizontal and help pull the boat [[Vertical direction|vertical]]. Righting a catamaran that is lying on its side involves using a righting line fed over the upper hull. The crew stands on the lower hull and pulls back on the righting line. In small [[catamaran|catamarans]] such as the [[Hobie 16]] it is imperative that at least one crew member assumes this task as soon as possible as there is a chance that the boat will [[Turtling (sailing)|turtle]] and then become extremely difficult to recover without assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fusionboats.com/pdf/FusionRighting.pdf |title=Fusion Capsize Manual |publisher=F-15 dinghy |format=PDF |accessdate=November 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221355/http://www.fusionboats.com/pdf/FusionRighting.pdf |archivedate=December 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[monohulls]] and catamarans  use a small flotation device mounted at the tip of the mast or mainsail to ensure that the craft cannot assume an inverted position, or at least that a fully inverted position is not stable (i.e. it would come to a position where the mast is lying on the surface of the water, which would be preferable to fully inverted).

In both cases, having a crew member lift the end of the mast out of the water may help speed the process, as the greatest challenge of righting a capsized boat is shedding the weight of the water from the sails. A helpful step, where possible (on a loose footed sail), is to disconnect the clew of the sail from the boom, which prevents the sail from scooping up water as the sail lifts out of the water. The [[Bow (ship)|bow]] of the capsized vessel should be pointed towards the wind so that when the sail starts to lift out of the water the wind can catch underneath the sail and help right the boat.

Care is taken not to let the boat swing all the way over and capsize on the other side, frequently with the crew on the bottom. This is more likely if the boat is not pointed into the wind.

== Prevention ==
There is a wide range of technology that can be installed or strategically placed to prevent or deter a boat or ship from capsizing. The various technologies rely on inflating airbags also known as lift bags which increasing the vessel's [[buoyancy]] with the water.

=== Yachts ===
Capsizing in yachts can occur when water is able to infiltrate the hull and decrease the vessels water and buoyancy leading to capsizing. Yachts can be deployed with a flotation system which is a series of strategically placed lift bags within the interior of the hull increasing the [[Buoyancy|vessel's buoyancy]] and filling void space where water can collect, providing valuable time to remove the water, fix damage or evacuate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turtlepac.com/products/underwater-lift-bags-yacht-floatation/|title=Underwater Lift Bags &amp; Yacht Floatation {{!}}|website=www.turtlepac.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large ships ===
When larger ships such as cargo ships and tankers capsize or sink not only is recovery not possible but great [[Oil spill|environment damage]] can occur from spillage of cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.su-sy.eu/|title=SuSy - Surfacing System for Ship Recovery|website=www.su-sy.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger ships are being equipped with Surfacing System for Ship Recovery which is an inflatable device that is installed in the [[ballast]] water tank or within the hull of the vessel and can be deployed within seconds of an accident to stabilize the vessel and give more time for rescue and evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/new-airbags-will-save-ships-from-sinking|title=New Airbags Will Save Ships From Sinking|last=Munoz|first=Gabriella|newspaper=ScienceAlert|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coving''' is a method of [[urban planning]] used in [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] and redevelopment of cities characterized by non-uniform [[Lot (real estate)|lot]] shapes and home placement. When combined with winding roads, lot area is increased and road area reduced. Coving is used as an alternative to conventional urban "[[Grid plan|grid]]" and suburban zoning-driven land development layouts in order to enhance curb appeal, eliminate monotony, reduce costs, such as road surfacing and street length, while increasing the amount of land available for construction.&lt;ref name = "PS_1"&gt;{{cite journal

== History ==

Coving was pioneered by [[Minneapolis]]-based [[urban design]]er Rick Harrison. His design intent was that no two houses look directly into each other's windows.  The name comes from coves of green spaces among the homes which are made possible by winding roads and meandering setbacks.&lt;ref name = "NYT"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Coving was first discovered by accident when Rick Harrison was experimenting with design options on a Chicago subdivision layout in 1990.{{fact|date=November 2017}}  By the meandering of setbacks and the elimination of pavement bubbles running the calculations through Land Innovation software it was discovered that street pavement was reduced 20%.  Assuming it was a software error, the site was manually checked.  What he had discovered was that by a careful meandering of the homes to form curved shapes separate from the direction of the street, there could be a significant reduction in street length.  Coving has led to many new discoveries and pioneering design methods and techniques as well as new software technologies and user interfaces.  Currently Coving is in its fourth generation, and has demonstrated an average reduction of public street length by 25% while maintaining density of conventional (curved street) subdivision platting.  More recently in 2013, advancements in architecture were made possible by the lot shaping and open space interconnection with living spaces within the home - redefining architecture as well as land planning.

[[File:A Coved Streetscape.JPG|thumb|A Coved Streetscape with homes using architectural shaping and blending in Viera Florida]]

Another area where coved design has made advancement is in the realm of Urban Redevelopment.  By abandoning excessive streets and right-of-ways a demonstrated reduction of public street of upwards of 60% can redefine how inner core suburban (typically tight gridded lots) are redeveloped.  This model was first created at the beginning of the 2008 recession and is being proposed in blighted urban spaces to bring about housing affordability and increased quality of life.

[[File:A coved redevelopment.JPG|thumb|A redevelopment plan with elements of coving proposed for Detroit]]
[[File:A Redevelopment example of Coving.JPG|thumb|A Redevelopment example of Coving used for a Detroit proposal]]

==Advantages and disadvantages==
A coved layout reduces construction costs by reducing roadway length, thereby lowering paving and utility-line costs. The reduction in road surface adds usable land for lots and parks. Other benefits are increased pedestrian safety due to less road and fewer intersections. Individual properties also gain aesthetic value from the separate meandering setback lines, sidewalks, and roadways.&lt;ref name = "aesthetic value"&gt;{{cite journal

Very early coved design (first generation) were somewhat experimental with potential problems:

Coving has been cited as having several disadvantages: greater set-back from the street, larger lots, reduced usability for mixed application, decreased walkability, decreased street and pedestrian connectivity of a tract to its surroundings, increased suburban sprawl, leaving little or no public open space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHAPTER XXXII - LAND DIVISION ORDINANCE |url=http://www.slinger-wi-usa.org/Ordinance%20Page/land%20division%20article%207.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613182846/http://www.slinger-wi-usa.org/Ordinance%20Page/land%20division%20article%207.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-13 |work=Village of Slinger, Wisconsin |accessdate=2007-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowing more soil [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and less communal open space than alternate development types such as [[urban cluster]] and [[new urbanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lancaster.ne.gov/city/pworks/watrshed/educate/bmpguide/pdf/bmpguid4.pdf | title=Low Impact Development | format=PDF | work=Lancaster, Nebraska | accessdate=2007-01-25 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to eliminate any negative elements of the design, research was done to visit early coved sites and query both residents and cities to revise and update the design methods.  Along with receiving comments from land developers and builders, coved design had gone through 4 iterations of evolution.  Today's coved designs have better vehicular flow reducing energy and time in transit, direct and connective pedestrian systems with safer and elegant meandering walks, as well as curve radii standards that reduce excessive infrastructure of early designs.  These comparisons are for traditional curved subdivision designs as well as the New Urbanism or smart growth methods of planning. In the top two images on this page, the before TND, or Smart Growth design has 54 street intersections and 38% more street length than the coved design of the same housing mix and density.  The coved plan has much better walking connectivity and is far safer with less interaction between vehicles and people. More important is that the average lot size increases 15% and monotony is eliminated.  As with all coved development, the design methods accomplish all of this and more by exceeding every existing regulatory minimum.  Coved development is unique in all of land planning in that it actually gains efficiency by exceeding existing regulatory minimums, it is the first method of design with such a claim to boast.  What this means is there is nothing special to request for approvals - the design exceeds the regulatory minimums.

== Design ==
An external early commentary was made about the covered design methods:

Designing coved developments is considered comparatively difficult. Specialized software is often used and designers often need several years of experience to become proficient. The design also isn't feasible for narrow tracts of land, and house footprints need to be less than 85% of the lot size.&lt;ref name="SDUT"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
Existing CAD based software is not intended to create plans that are not based upon replication.  With coved design there is little if any replication.  LandMentor, a software product can produce plans using coving concepts within an acceptable time frame.

'''Erukhan''' ({{lang-hy|Երուխան}}) (1870 &amp;ndash; 1915) was the pen name for '''Yervant Srmakeshkhanlian''' ({{lang-hy|Երուանդ Սրմաքէշխանլեան}}), was an Armenian writer of the late 19th and early 20th century. He was arrested, tortured, and killed by the [[Turkey|Turkish]] authorities during the [[Armenian Genocide]].

== Life ==

Erukhan was born in 1870 in the city of [[Constantinople]]. He received his childhood education from the Nersesian institution, an old and shabby building serving as a school. Erukhan based one of his humorous characters in the novel “The Lord’s Daughter” (Armenian: Ամիրային Աղջիկը) on the school’s principal: Constantine Abantarian. As a student, Erukhan was said to be a lazy and weak student. He had a particular distaste for [[mathematics]], saying that the first individuals that he detested in his life were his mathematics teachers.

In 1886, his father pushed him to pursue a career in medicine but a family friend persuaded him to enroll his son in the newly opened Central College (Armenian: Կեդրոնական Վարժարան). Erukhan enrolled in the school, but he was unable to be a first-rate student. Ironically, he was even mediocre in Armenian literature. He fell ill during the end of year exam session and was unable to write his exams. His appeal for make up examinations was refused and he dropped out of the institution. 
[[File:Erukhan photograph.jpg|thumb|Erukhan]]
Being from a poor family, he was forced to quickly find work. He worked for a week alongside a trader before being fired supposedly because he “wasn’t the man for the job”. 
During the next two years, Erukhan devoted himself to reading a multitude of novels from various [[Europe]]an and Armenian writers, he also became fluent in the [[French language]]. He then joined the editing team of the newspaper East (Armenian: Արեւելք) as translator. He eventually started writing his own material, and his talent was spotted by the great Armenian writers of the time [[Krikor Zohrab|Zohrab]] and [[Arpiar Arpiarian|Arpiarian]]. He was encouraged to continue writing and his works were continually published in the newspapers East (Armenian: Արեւելք) and Masis (Armenian: Մասիս).

In 1896, during the [[Hamidian massacres]], he fled the country, alongside many other Armenian intellectuals. He settled in [[Bulgaria]], where he wrote for the newspaper Shavigh (Armenian: Շաւիղ) and worked as a teacher as well. In 1904, he moved to [[Egypt]] where he took charge of the editing of Light Bringer (Armenian: Լուսաբեր) newspaper. He got married to one of his former students in 1905.

== Works ==

''The Lord’s Daughter'' (Amirayin aghchige, Armenian: Ամիրային աղջիկը) is possibly one of the best works in Western Armenian literature. The author portrays a tragedy about the disparity between two classes of Armenians living in Constantinople.

''The Legitimate Son'' (Harazad vortin, Armenian: Հարազատ որդին) is a spiritual novel about a husband who thinks his wife has wronged him and that their son is therefore illegitimate. The father is tormented about the thought and finally commits suicide.

Erukhan wrote many short stories describing the hard yet simple life of fishermen, firemen and porters. These works were gathered and published in Paris in 1942. He also had many published articles throughout the years in various newspapers.

== Writing Style ==

Erukhan can be classified as a realist that came from a younger generation of Armenian writers. He was preceded by Zohrab and other realist novelists. In a career spanning a quarter century, he wrote approximately sixty short novels and two novels. His stories are of great value to historians because he was able to depict in great details the daily setting of many characters. His accurate descriptions have become a form of documented history of those specific individuals and their respective environment. He provides great insight into the careers, social norms, social hierarchy, ideologies and even gossip of that specific era. This author didn’t look to the aristocracy for his storylines, but instead embraced the commoner as his main source of character depictions. The reader truly feels the joys and the pains of these common people in his novels.

He was convinced that work and hard labor truly molded men into better people and made them better able to appreciate life. The ones that struggled to bring food on the table were purer of heart than those who did not, according to him. He truly did sympathize with the poor, but did recognize their bravery and their resolute nature. His stories can be seen as a sort of homage to those who have never received any.

His language is usually simple but it does sometimes get clogged with a more difficult vocabulary and many nuanced comparisons. The influence of other prominent writers of his époque can be seen in some of his writings.

== Death ==

He returned to Constantinople in 1908, where he became principal of his former school: the Central College. Five years later, he moved to [[Kharberd]] (Nor Kyurin) (Armenian: Խարբերդ) where he took an administrative role in a local school. April 24, 1915 signaled the start of the Armenian Genocide. Erukhan, along with a priest, was arrested and thrown in jail shortly after that date. They were tortured for many days, after which they were chained and made to walk to streets of [[Kharberd]]. The Turkish soldiers herded them outside the city and shot Erukhan and the priest. His wife and two children were killed in the [[death marches]] leading to [[Deir ez-Zor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34755">Verbs in the [[Finnish language]] can be divided into six main groups depending on the stem type, both for formal analysis and for teaching the language to non-native speakers.  All six types have the same set of personal endings, but the stems assume different suffixes and undergo (slightly) different changes when inflected.

The article on [[Finnish language grammar]] has more about verbs and other aspects of Finnish grammar.

==Tables of conjugation==
Tables of conjugation are given here for the regular verb, of type I ''puhua'' (to speak), as used in the formal, written language. Verb conjugation in the everyday [[Colloquial Finnish|spoken language]] is somewhat different.

===Basic tenses in the indicative mood===

|-
! colspan="3" | passive voice
| puhutaan || ei puhuta || puhuttiin || ei puhuttu || on puhuttu || ei ole puhuttu || oli puhuttu || ei ollut puhuttu
|}
The present, imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect correspond fairly well to English: "speaks", "spoke", "has spoken", and "had spoken", respectively or in the passive voice, "it is spoken", "it was spoken", "it has been spoken", and "it had been spoken". The auxiliary verb ''ei'' used for negation, usually with the naked stem of the main verb but with the past participle in the negative imperfect. Finnish lacks a true future tense, so normally the present tense is used for future time as well.

===Conditional and potential mood===

|-
! colspan="3" | passive voice
| puhuttaisiin || ei puhuttaisi || olisi puhuttu || ei olisi puhuttu || puhuttaneen || ei puhuttane || lienee puhuttu || ei liene puhuttu
|}
The conditional mood corresponds mostly to "would" or "should" or to the past subjunctive in English. (Finnish lacks a subjunctive mood.)  The potential mood is rather rare, and corresponds to "may" or "might" in English.  The perfect forms of these moods are easily understood as "would have", "should have", "might have", etc.

===Imperative mood and miscellaneous tenses===

!colspan="3"| || colspan="4" | imperative mood || colspan="4" | indicative mood

|-

|-

|-
! 1st || rowspan="3" | pl.
| me || puhukaamme || älkäämme puhuko || olkaamme puhuneet || älkäämme olko puhuneet || &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash;
|-
! 2nd
| te || puhukaa || älkää puhuko || olkaa puhuneet || älkää olko puhuneet || &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash;
|-
! 3rd
| he || puhukoot || älkööt puhuko || olkoot puhuneet || älkööt olko puhuneet || &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash; || &amp;mdash;
|-
! colspan="3" | passive voice
| puhuttakoon ||ei puhuttako&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br/&gt;älköön puhuttako|| olkoon puhuttu || älköön olko puhuttu || on puhuttava || ei ole puhuttava || oli puhuttava || ei ollut puhuttava
|}

The first and third person imperative forms here correspond to English "let us speak", "let him not speak", "let it not be spoken", etc.  The perfect imperative is still valid, if somewhat awkward and contrived: as English "let it (not) have been spoken". The first person plural imperative ''puhukaamme'' sounds rather formal and archaic so in everyday speech, the passive present indicative, ''puhutaan'', is used instead, but it may not quite be considered correct. There are many variations of the imperative forms: in old writings, one may also see the forms ''puhukaat'' or ''puhukaatte'' for the second person plural, ''puhukaan'' for the third person plural, or ''puhuttakaan'' for the passive. In the passive or third person, the imperative is sometimes used for the present or perfect [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] of other languages, a [[grammatical mood|mood]] lacking in Finnish.

The [[:fi:Liittopreesens|present prospective]] and the [[:fi:Liittoimperfekti|imperfect prospective]] correspond best to "I am to speak" and "I was to speak" in English. It is not correct Finnish to use these tenses in the plural: the plural form of the present participle, ''puhuvat'', would be confusing if used in this sense, as it resembles too closely the third person plural present indicative. Despite the apparently equivalent use of the present participle, the [[grammatical aspect]] of these tenses is [[Prospective aspect|prospective]] rather than [[continuous and progressive aspects|continuous or progressive]] as in English.

===Verbs of obligation in the agent construction===

Verbs of obligation such as ''täytyä'', ''tarvita'', ''pitää'', and ''tulla'', with the meanings "must", "need to", "ought to", "shall", respectively are often used in the agent form of construction in which the verb is not conjugated for person but is in the impersonal third person singular. Here
* the person or persons bearing the obligation are regarded as the 'agent' (not the subject) and in the genitive case
* the verb of obligation is in the impersonal &lt;u&gt;third person singular&lt;/u&gt; regardless of the plurality and person of the agent.
* This is followed by another verb or verb phrase in which the verb is in the short from first infinitive (the dictionary form) and which is then regarded as the sentence's subject.&lt;ref&gt;Pirjo Leino: Suomen kielioppi pg 114 Infinitive Subject. Otava 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

: Heidä&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt; täyty&lt;u&gt;y&lt;/u&gt; puhua minun kanssani = ''They must speak with me'';
: Minun täytyy puhua heidän kanssansa = ''I must speak with them'';
: Sinun ei tarvitse tehdä tuota = ''you don't need to do that'';
: Ei sinun pidä tappaman  = ''thou shalt not kill''.&lt;ref&gt;Note the archaic use of the [[instructive case]] of the third infinitive. A common error, even for native Finns, is to confuse this with the illative case, ''tappamaan'', which would be incorrect.  Now, the first infinitive is used with ''pitää''.&lt;/ref&gt;
: Sinun pitäisi tulla huomenna = ''you should come tomorrow''.

There is no equivalent of this type of construction in English.

The verb ''täytyä'' can be used only in this construction and therefore has no other personal forms. The other verbs can carry personal endings in other forms of construction with the normal subject, verb, and object in which the obligation is less strong or in which the verb takes on a different meaning altogether.

* (Minä) tarvitsen apua  ''I need help'', expressing need without obligation
* (Minä) pidän hänestä ''I like him/her'', verb has a different meaning

==Infinitives and participles==
In Finnish there are five infinitive forms,&lt;ref&gt;Savolainen, Erkki.  [http://www.finnlectura.fi/verkkosuomi/Morfologia/sivu25221.htm Verkkokielioppi: 2.5.2.2.1 Infinitiivit] [http://www.finnlectura.fi/ Finn Lectura] 2001&lt;/ref&gt; with past and present participles for both active and passive voices.&lt;ref&gt;Savolainen, Erkki.  [http://www.finnlectura.fi/verkkosuomi/Morfologia/sivu25222.htm Verkkokielioppi: 2.5.2.2.2 Partisiipit] [http://www.finnlectura.fi/ Finn Lectura] 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinitive I===
First infinitive is the dictionary form of the verb: ''puhu-a'' = "to speak" (stem ''puhu''), and it corresponds in meaning and function to the English infinitive introduced by the particle "to". The suffix of the first infinitive depends on the type of the verb stem. With so-called "vowel" stems, (see verbs of Type I, below), the first infinitive suffix is ''-a''/''-ä'', whereas with "consonantal" stems, (types IV-VI), the suffix is most often ''-ta''/''-tä''. With vowel stems that consist of a single open syllable ending in a long vowel or a [[diphthong]] or longer stems that end in such syllables, (Type II), the infinitive suffix is ''-da''/''-dä'': ''saa-da'' = "to get", ''syö-dä'' = "to eat", ''reagoi-da'' = "to react". The first infinitive of consonantal stems always has the weak [[consonant gradation|consonant grade]] in the stem, e.g., ''ka'''''r'''''ata'' = "to flee" &lt; stem ''ka'''''rk'''''aa-''.

It can be used in a sentence similarly to the English infinitive and stand for a subject or a direct object, without any additional inflection.  It is also [[case government|governed]] by [[modal verb]]s like ''saattaa'' "might" or ''voida'' "be able to": ''saattaa mennä'' = "might go" or ''voi hakea'' = "can fetch".

It has a so-called "long form", with the ending of the nominal [[translative case]] and an obligatory possessive suffix. The long form is usually associated with the literary register.  It connotes either extent or intent:
:''muista-a'' = "to remember"; ''muista-a-kse-ni'' = "as far as I can remember" (extent), or "in order that I might remember" (intent), lit. "for my remembering".
:''näh-dä'' = "to see"; ''näh-dä-kse-en'' = "as far as he/she/it/they can see" (extent), "so that they could see" (intent).
In spoken Finnish, intent is often expressed with the short form infinitive if the subject is implicit or understood by context or more explicitly with a subordinate clause containing a conditional verb: ''että minä muistaisin''.  Nevertheless, the long form is still used to signify extent; another example: ''tietä-ä'' = "to know", ''tietä-ä-kse-ni'' = "as far as I know".

The first infinitive generally take on no inflected forms. It appears only in the short (dictionary) form and in the long form, and the long form is not used without a possessive suffix.

===Infinitive II===
The second infinitive may be formed from the first infinitive by replacing the final 'a/ä' with an 'e'. It occurs in the [[instructive]] and [[inessive]] cases. If the second infinitive has a subject, the subject is put in the genitive case; in the inessive case, the second infinitive also accepts a possessive suffix if it is appropriate.

The instructive form conveys manner of action corresponding approximately with "-ing" or "-ingly" in English, less commonly with "-ande/ende" in Swedish and very commonly with "-ant" in French. It is parallel in function and meaning to the Russian [[adverbial participle]] (as opposed to the [[adjectival participle]]):
:''tietä'''en''''' = "knowingly" (instructive);
:''tietä'''en''''', että hänen täytyisi puhua'' = "knowing that he would have to speak" = ''sach'''ant''' qu'il aurait besoin de parler'' in French = ''зна'''я''', что ему следовало бы говорить'' in Russian
:'näin puhu'''en'''' = "thus speaking" (instructive);

The inessive form conveys coterminal action, something happening at the same time as something else. More properly, it is seen as some action whose accomplishment simultaneously brings about the accomplishment of something else. It corresponds approximately in English to the use of "when", "while", or the somewhat archaic or British "whilst"; strict co-terminality is still expressed in English with "in" or"by", the present participle "-ing" and any subject in the possessive case in a manner analogous to the Finnish, like in French with "''en''" and the present participle "''-ant''":

:''kuoll'''essa''''' = "in dying" or "while dying" = ''en mour'''ant''''' in French (inessive) = ''умира'''я''''' in Russian
:''Varas iski uhrin syöd'''essä''' aamupalaa'' = "The thief struck whilst the victim was eating breakfast"

The inessive of this infinitive also has a passive form:
:''tiede'''ttäessä''''' = "in being known", said of some fact;
but it is ambiguous and could be taken for the active inessive infinitive II of the [[causative]] ''tiedettää'', "to make (someone) know"
:''tiedettä'''essä''''' = "in making (someone) know" or "in making (some fact) known".

===Infinitive III===
The third infinitive is formed by adding the ending ''-ma/mä'' to the hard grade of the present stem. It is a noun in its own right, denoting "the act" of a verb. It is fully declineable as a noun, but some of the cases have special or commonly understood meanings. The [[illative]] of the third infinitive is a common [[inchoative]], governed by such verbs as ''ruveta'' and ''joutua'':
:''hän rupesi saarnaa'''maan''''' = "he began to preach"
:''häntä ei mennä neuvo'''maan''''' = "You don't go and advise him"
The [[elative case|elative]] is used in the sense of forbidding or discouraging an action.
:''poikia kiellettiin poltta'''masta''''' = "the boys were forbidden from smoking"
The [[adessive]] is used to tell how the action is done.
:''jätteet hävitettiin poltta'''malla''''' = "the waste was destroyed by burning"
Also with a possessive suffix.
:''poltta'''mallani''' sormella en voinut kirjoittaa'' = "I couldn't type with the finger I burned"
:''kun toimimme neuvo'''mallasi''' tavalla kaikki onnistui'' = "when we did the way you advised all went well"

====Agentive participle====
In Finnish, the passive participle cannot be used when the agent is expressed. Finnish uses forms ending in ''-ma/mä'' that are formally identical to the third infinitive. (Some authors include it as one of the uses of the third infinitive; others list it under the special name "agentive participle".) The agentive participle is never used when the agent is '''not''' expressed, and  it must be used in all situations that one wishes to use the passive and express the agent:
:''Talo on Pekan maalaa'''ma''''' = "The house was painted by Pekka"
:''Pekan maalaa'''ma''' talo'' = "the house painted by Pekka"
:''Talo on (sinun) maalaa'''ma'''si'' = "The house was painted by you"
As expected for a participle, it agrees with the head noun; in the following, the ending ''-mia'' and ''kirjeita'' 'letters' are in the partitive plural:
:''pojan viime viikolla Japanista ystävilleen kirjoitta'''mia''' kirjeitä'' = "(some of) the letters written by the boy to his friends last week from Japan"

===Infinitive IV===
The fourth infinitive is formed just like the third but with the ending ''-minen'', which is declined like all other Finnish nouns in ''-nen''.  It is also a noun but its meaning is more "the process" rather than the very act of a verb.  This often corresponds to "-ation" words in English:
:''käy'''minen''''' = "(the process of) going", which can mean "fermentation" among other things.
The use of this form as a proper infinitive rather than an "action noun" is generally restricted to forms such as the following in which it implies a sort of obligation:
:''minun on teke'''minen''' jotakin'' = "it is up to me to do something"
:''on teke'''minen''' jotakin'' = "something ought to be done"
:''heidän ei ole kysy'''mistä''' ...'' = "theirs is not to ask ..."
:''tästä ei ole puhu'''mista''''' = "this is not to be spoken of";
or this construction, where the finite verb is repeated in the partitive with a possessive suffix:
:''hän puhui puhu'''mistaan''''' = "he talked and talked".

===Infinitive V===
The rarely-used fifth infinitive is a "diminutive" of the third infinitive. It is apparently used only in the [[Adessive case|adessive]] plural with a possessive suffix. It indicates that at some point, the action of the verb is "but little" accomplished:
:''olin puhu'''maisillani''''' = "I was just starting to speak".

===Present participles===
====Active====
The active present participle is formed by adding ''-va/vä'' to the hard grade of the present indicative stem of the verb.
:''tule'''va'''t päivät ovat tuulisia'' = "the coming days are (going to be) windy"
(In the nominative plural, the form nearly always coincides with the third person plural present indicative.)

====Passive====
There is also a passive present participle formed by adding the same ending to the passive stem:
:''puhu'''ttava''''' = "to be spoken of"
This form is also ambiguous: it could equally well be the active present participle of the [[causative]] ''puhuttaa'', "to cause (someone) to speak", thus:
:''puhutta'''va''''' = (active) "making (someone) speak"
:''puhute'''ttava''''' = (passive) "being made to speak"

===Past participles===
====Active====
The active past participle is usually formed by adding ''-nut/nyt'' to the short stem, omitting any [[epenthetic]] vowel. Verbs of type III (ending in ''-lla/llä'', ''-rra/rrä'', and ''-sta/stä'') assimilate the ''n'' of this ending:
:''tul'''lut''''' = "(one that has) come";
:''pur'''rut''''' = "(one that has) bitten";
:''pes'''syt''''' = "(one that has) washed".
The stem of the active past participle, for all other cases except the nominative singular, ends in ''-nee-'', which may be likewise assimilated. See tables of conjugation.

====Agentive====
See [[Finnish verb conjugation#Agentive Participle|Agentive Participle]] above.

====Passive====
The passive past participle has the ending ''-tu/ty'' or ''-ttu/tty'' to the soft grade of the stem. For a verb of type I, a final '''''-a/ä-''''' of the stem is replaced by '''''-e-''''' for the passive past participle:
: ''ant'''a'''a'' = "to give"; ''ann'''e'''ttu'' = "(that has been) given".
The passive past participle is subject to [[consonant gradation]]:
:''tt'' → ''t'';
and for verbs of type III:
:''lt'' → ''ll'',&lt;math&gt;\quad&lt;/math&gt; ''nt'' → ''nn'',&lt;math&gt;\quad&lt;/math&gt; ''rt'' → ''rr'', &lt;math&gt;\quad&lt;/math&gt; ''st'' → ''st''.

: ''anne'''ttu''''' = (that has been) given; ''anne'''tut''''' = "(that have been) given", (pl.);
: ''pur'''tu''''' "(one that has been) bitten", graded as ''pur'''ru-''''', e.g. ''pur'''run''''' "of that which has been bitten".
: ''pes'''ty''''' = "(that has been) washed", unchanged in soft grade, e.g. ''pes'''tyt''' hiukset'' = "hair that has been washed" (pl. of ''hius'', "a single hair").

=====Derived passive forms=====
All other passive forms of the verb may be regularly derived from the passive past participle by replacing the final ''-u/y'' with the following endings:
* in the hard grade:
** ''''-iin':''' passive imperfect; ''annettiin'' "was given"
** ''''-ava':''': passive present participle; ''annettava'' "that which is (to be) given"
** ''''-aisiin/äisiin':''' passive conditional; ''annettaisiin'' "would be given"
** ''''-aisi/äisi':''' passive conditional connegative with [[negative verb]] ''ei''; ''ei annettaisi'' "would not be given"
** ''''-aneen/äneen':''' passive potential; ''annettaneen'' "might be given"
** ''''-ane/äne':''' passive potential connegative; ''ei annettane'' "might not be given"
** ''''-akoon/äköön', '-akaan/äkään':''' passive imperative; ''annettakoon'' "shall be given"
** ''''-ako/äkö':''' passive imperative connegative; ''ei annettako'' "shall not be given"
* in the soft grade:
**''''-aan/ään':''' passive present indicative; ''annetaan'' "is given"
**''''-a/ä':''' passive present indicative connegative with negative verb ''ei''; ''ei anneta'' "is not given"

==Type I verbs==
They are verbs whose infinitive forms end in vowel + ''a/ä'', for example ''puhua'' = "to speak", ''tietää'' = "to know". The group contains a very large number of verbs.  Here is how ''tietää'' conjugates in the present indicative:

:''minä tiedä'''n''''' = '''I''' know
:''sinä tiedä'''t''''' = '''you''' (singular) know
:''hän tiet'''ää''''' = '''(s)he/it''' knows
:''se tiet'''ää''''' = '''(s)he/it''' knows {{qualifier|colloquial}}
:''me tiedä'''mme''''' = '''we''' know
:''te tiedä'''tte''''' = '''you''' (plural/formal) know
:''he tietä'''vät''''' = '''they''' know
:''ne tietä'''ä''''' = '''they''' know {{qualifier|colloquial}}

The personal endings are ''-n'', ''-t'', ''-(doubled final vowel)'', ''-mme'', ''-tte'', ''-vat''.  The inflecting stem is formed by dropping the final ''-a/ä'' of the infinitive and has a strong-grade consonant in the third-person forms and weak-grade elsewhere. For the third person plural, it is an exception to the general rule for strong grade.

===Past tense===
In the simple case (which applies to most type I verbs), the imperfect indicative is formed by inserting the characteristic marker ''i'' between the stem and the personal endings, which are the same as in the present tense except that the vowel does '''not''' double in the third person singular:
:''puhu'''n''''' = "I speak", ''puhu'''in''''' = 'I spoke'
:''puhu'''t''''' = "you speak", ''puhu'''it''''' = 'you spoke'
:''puhu'''u''''' = "(he) speaks", ''puhu'''i''''' = '(he) spoke'
:''puhu'''mme''''' = "we speak", ''puhu'''imme''''' = 'we spoke' and so on.

However, the insertion of the ''i'' often has an effect on the stem. Of type I verbs, one notable exception is ''tietää'':
:''tiedän'' = 'I know', ''tiesin'' = 'I knew'

''ymmärtää'' = 'to understand' also follows this pattern. Changes of stem for other verb types will be discussed in the relevant sections below.

===Passive===
;Present passive: The present passive is formed by adding ''-taan'' to the inflecting stem of the verb with the consonant in its weak form:
:puhua &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; puhu- &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; puhutaan
:If the vowel at the end of the stem is ''a'' or ''ä'', it is changed to ''e'' before the ''-taan'' ending:
:tietää &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; tiedä- &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; tiede &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; tiedetään

;Past passive: It is formed in the same way as the present passive except that the ending is ''-ttiin'': ''puhuttiin'' = 'it was spoken', ''tiedettiin'' = 'it was known'.
:Note the presence of the same ''i'' marker in the past passive as in the imperfect indicative and the presence of the extra ''t''.

;Conditional passive: It is formed in the same way as the present passive except that the ending is ''-ttaisiin'', hence ''puhuttaisiin'' = 'it would be spoken', ''tiedettäisiin'' = 'it would be known'.
:Note the presence of the ''isi'' conditional marker.

;Potential passive: It is formed in the same way as the present passive except that the ending is ''-ttaneen'', hence ''puhuttaneen'' = 'it may be spoken', ''tiedettäneen'' = 'it may be known'.
:Note the presence of the ''ne'' potential marker.

==Type II verbs==
With verbs whose first infinitive ends in vowel + ''da'' ( ''juoda'' = 'to drink', ''syödä'' = 'to eat'), it is a fairly large group of verbs partly because one way in which foreign borrowings are incorporated into the Finnish verb paradigms is to add ''oida'': ''organisoida'' = 'to organise'.

Another important verb of this type is ''voida'' = 'to be able/allowed to'.

The stem is formed by removing ''da'' with no vowel doubling in the third person singular: juon, juot, juo, juomme, juotte, juovat.

===Imperfect indicative===
For these verbs whose stems end in two vowels, the '''first''' of the vowels is lost when the ''i'' is added in the imperfect:
''juon = 'I drink', ''join'' = 'I drank'.

There is an exception to the rule if the stem already ends in an ''i'' (''voida'' or the ''-oida'' verbs mentioned earlier). Then, the stem does not change between present and imperfect indicative so the imperfect forms are the same as the present forms, and the distinction between them must be made from context.

===Passive===
Passives are formed in the same way:
:syödä &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; syödään, syötiin, syötäisiin
:juoda &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; juodaan, juotiin, juotaisiin

==Type III verbs==
Verbs have a first infinitive ending in two consonants + ''a'': ''mennä'' = 'to go'. Another way of looking at the verbs is that they have verb stems ending in a consonant to which a vowel must be added (''e'' for the present tense or ''i'' for the past tense) before the personal ending. The final consonant of the stem is generally emphasised by length in the infinitive and participle forms and so is written as a double consonant. If the consonant ending of the stem is -s, however, the dictionary form of the verb ends with -stä or -sta. It is another large group of verbs.

===Present indicative===
The stem is formed by removing the ''a'' and its preceding consonant, and ''e'' followed is added, followed by the personal endings: menen, menet, menee, menemme, menette, menevät.

===Imperfect indicative===
The ''i'' of the imperfect is added directly to the stem formed as for the present tense, and the personal endings are added:
''pestä'' = 'to clean', ''pesen'' = 'I clean', ''pesin'' = 'I cleaned' etc.

===Passive===
;Present passive
:The passive has the same ''-aan'' ending as for group I verbs but no ''t''; the easiest way to form the passive is to extend the vowel on the end of the first infinitive and then add ''n'':

:mennä &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; mennään

;Other forms
:All other forms of the passive are related to the present passive in the same way as for type I verbs, including the 'extra t', except that since there was no ''t'' to start with, the passive forms have only one. Also, the double consonant before the ending becomes single.

:mennä &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; mennään &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; mentiin, mentäisiin
:olla &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ollaan &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; oltiin (see below), oltaisiin

==Type IV verbs==
Types IV-VI have a first infinitive ending in a vowel and ''ta/tä''.  Most commonly, type IV verbs end with ''ata/ätä'', ''ota/ötä'', ''uta/ytä'', but other vowels are possible: ''tavata'' = "to meet", ''pilkata'' = "to mock", ''vastata'' = "to answer", ''haluta'' = "to want", ''tarjota'' = "to offer".

The stem used in present indicative conjugation is formed by dropping the ''-ta/-tä'' suffix from the infinitive form and adding ''a/ä''. In conjugation, the normal personal ending is added; the final vowel is doubled in the third person singular unless the stem already ends in ''aa/ää'':
:''halua-n, halua-t, halua-a, halua-mme, halua-tte, halua-vat''
:''tapaa-n, tapaat, tapaa, tapaa-mme'', etc.
:''pilkkaa-n, pilkkaa-t, pilkkaa, pilkkaa-mme'', etc.
:''vastaa-n, vastaa-t, vastaa, vastaa-mme'', etc.
:''tarjoa-n, tarjoa-t, tarjoa-a, tarjoa-mme'', etc.

The consonant in the stem appears in the strong grade.

===Imperfect indicative===

The imperfect stem can be obtained from the infinitive by changing the final ''t'' to ''s'' followed by the usual imperfect marker ''i''; the stem consonant appears in the strong grade: ''halusi-n'' = "I wanted", ''tapasi-t'' = "you met", ''vastasi'', "he answered", etc.

===Passive===
Passives in this type are formed in the same fashion as for type I verbs; as in type I, the stem consonant appears in the weak grade:
:''haluta'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; halutaan, haluttiin, haluttaisiin
:''tavata'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; tavataan, tavattiin, tavattaisiin
:''vastata'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; vastataan, vastattu, vastattiin, etc.

==Type V verbs==
All verbs have infinitives ending in ''ita/itä''. There are few members, but ''tarvita'' = "to need" is a common example.

The indicative stem may be obtained by dropping the final ''a'' and adding ''-se'': tarvitsen, tarvitset, tarvitsee, tarvitsemme, tarvitsette, tarvitsevat.

===Imperfect indicative===
''-si'' takes the place of ''-se'', but in the third-person singular, there is only one vowel: ''tarvitsin, tarvitsit, tarvitsi, tarvitsimme, tarvitsitte, tarvitsivat''.

===Passive===
The passive forms of these verbs are built just like those of type IV; both types end in ''-ta''.
:valita &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; valitaan, valittiin, valittaisiin
:merkitä &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; merkitään, merkittiin, merkittäisiin

==Type VI verbs==
Almost all verbs have infinitives ending in 'eta' (notable exceptions are ''parata'' = "to improve/become better" and ''huonota'' = "to deteriorate/become worse"). There are not many verbs in this category, and they tend to be uncommon. However, it is a fairly common route for turning adjectives into verbs: ''kylmä'' = "cold", ''kylmetä'' = "to get cold".

The present stem is characterized by the insertion of ''ne'' after the infinitive stem and so the final syllable of the stem is open, and hence the final consonant of the stem is in strong grade:
:''rohje-ta' = "to dare"
::''rohkene'''n''''' = "I dare"
::''rohkene'''t''''' = "you dare"
::''rohkene'''e''''' = 'he/she/it dares' etc.
:''pae-ta'' = "to escape", ''pakene'''n''''' = "I escape"
:''kylme-tä'' = "to get cold", ''kylmene'''n''''' = "I get cold"
:''para-ta'' = "to improve" (intransitive), ''parane'''n''''' = "I improve"

===Imperfect indicative===
The imperfect indicative is formed by replacing the final "e" of the "ne" stem with the imperfect marker "i":
::''rohkeni'''n''''' = "I dared"
::''rohkeni'''t''''' = "you dared"
::''rohkeni'' = "he/she/it dared" etc.

===Passive===
Passives are formed in the same way as for type IV verbs.

==Nonderivable and irregular stems==

Standard Finnish has comparatively very few irregular verbs in addition to 'olla' discussed above. However, because the infinitive is an inflected form of the root, the [[consonant gradation]] may obscure the root. The root of the word 'juosta' = 'to run' is ''juoks-''; when generating the infinitive, the pattern ''ks'' → ''s'' is applied: ''juoks+ta'' → ''juosta''. Epenthetic 'e' is added for personal forms: ''juoksen''.

There is a rare pattern with a stem with ''-k-'' rendered as ''-hdä'' in the infinitive but disappearing in gradation:
:'tehdä' = 'to do, make': tee-; teen, teet, tekee, teemme, teette, tekevät, etc.
:'nähdä' = 'to see': näe-; näen, näet, näkee, näemme, näette, näkevät, etc.
That is, ''teke-'' and ''näke-'' forms are rendered as ''tehdä'' and ''nähdä'' in the infinitive but are subject to gradation of 'k' in personal forms like ''teen''. In some colloquial forms, the 'e' is rendered as a chroneme instead: ''nään'' instead of ''näen'' etc.

[[Spoken Finnish]] adds some more irregular verbs by assimilative deletion:
:tulla - tule - tuu
:mennä - mene - mee
:panna - pane - paa
:olla - ole - oo

'''Gabriela Antunes''' (8 July 1937 - 3 April 2004) was an [[Angola]]n writer and educator.

==Biography==
Antunes was born on 8 July 1937 in [[Huambo]]. After completing secondary school in Huambo, she moved to [[Lisbon]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=portal&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabriela Antunes|url=http://www.portaldaliteratura.com/autores.php?autor=2264|work=Portal da Literatura|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She obtained a bachelor's degree in linguistics in Germany.&lt;ref name="James2004"/&gt; Antunes earned a postgraduate degree in Education and English in [[Luanda]]. She began working at the Sarmento Rodrigues Commercial and Industrial School, and in 1964 was hired at the English and German Commercial Institute of Luanda. She also taught at the Superior Private Institute of Angola. Antunes was the [[UNESCO]] Coordinator of Portuguese in Angola. In addition, she was the director of the [[Angolan National Library]].&lt;ref name=portal/&gt;

Gabriela Antunes was professor and journalism program coordinator at the High Institute of Luanda Economics. In the sports field, she achieved the position of chairman of the general meeting of the [[Angolan Swimming Federation]].&lt;ref name=noticias&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabriela Antunes foi a enterrar esta tarde no Alto das Cruzes|url=http://www.angonoticias.com/Artigos/item/533/gabriela-antunes-foi-a-enterrar-esta-tarde-no-alto-das-cruzes|work=AngoNotícias|date=8 April 2004|author=ANGOP|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, she changed jobs from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Culture, headed at the time by [[António Jacinto]]. At this point, she became more interested in children's literature. Antunes joined the Angolan Writers Union (UEA) in June 1984. In 1986, she hosted a children's program on the [[Public Television of Angola]].&lt;ref name=morte&gt;{{cite web|last=Cardoso|first=Pedro|title=Morte de Gabriela Antunes deixa um vazio na literatura infantil angolana|url=http://www.angop.ao/angola/pt_pt/noticias/lazer-e-cultura/2004/3/15/Morte-Gabriela-Antunes-deixa-vazio-literatura-infantil-angolana,0109736b-9f11-4796-a5d3-fca011874271.html|work=[[ANGOP]]|date=7 April 2004|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in several seminars and conferences in Africa, America and Europe as well as in the first Biennial, held in December 1995.&lt;ref name=nexus/&gt;

One of her best known works is ''Histórias Velhas, Roupa Nova'' or ''Estórias velhas, roupa nova'', a collection of four children's stories.&lt;ref name="MacêdoChaves2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macêdo|first1=Tania|last2=Chaves|first2=Rita de Cássia Natal|last3=Flory|first3=Suely Fadul Villibor|title=Literaturas de língua portuguesa: Angola|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVOMzsHj28IC&amp;pg=PA157|year=2007|publisher=Arte &amp; Ciência|isbn=978-85-7473-339-5|page=157|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote several works adapting traditional tales for children, and asserted that her mission was "to tell them of their things, their land, beauty and people."&lt;ref name=morte/&gt; She won the Culture Award from the Cultural Foundation of the Portuguese Language in 1999 for her contributions to Portuguese language literature.&lt;ref name="James2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Martin W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Angola|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTSoqGzOPXsC&amp;pg=PA8|date=27 May 2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6560-0|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February 2000, she was honored at the Camões Institute, the Embassy of Portugal in Angola, in recognition of her literary work.&lt;ref name=nexus&gt;{{cite web|title=Escritora Gabriela Antunes morre vítima de doença|url=http://www.nexus.ao/view.cfm?m_id=12292&amp;cat_02=NOTICIAS|work=Nexus|date=5 April 2004|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Puang Matoa 2004.JPG|thumb|In Bugis society, androgynous ''bissu'' are priests, shamans, sorcerers, or mediums.]]

The [[Bugis]] people are the most numerous of the three major [[ethnic group]]s of [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peletz |first=Michael G. |title=Gender Pluralism: Southeast Asia Since Early Modern Times |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-415-93161-8 |oclc=351812201}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

In contrast to the [[gender binary|two-gender system]], Bugis society recognises five [[gender]]s: ''makkunrai'', ''oroané'', ''bissu'', ''calabai'', and ''calalai''.&lt;ref name="Graham Davies"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham Davies |first=Sharyn |title=Challenging Gender Norms: Five Genders Among Bugis in Indonesia |series=Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |year=2006 |page=xi |isbn=978-0-495-09280-3 |oclc=476076313}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Oroané" and "Makkunrai" are comparable to [[cisgender]] [[men]] and [[women]], respectively.

''Bissu'' are [[androgynous]] [[shaman]]s. ''Calalai'' and ''calabai'' are respectively approximately equivent to [[trans men]] and [[trans women]].&lt;ref name="Graham Davies"/&gt;

In daily social life, the ''bissu'', the ''calabai'', and the ''calalai'' may enter the dwelling places and the villages of both men and women.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Bissu==
The ''bissu'' belong to one of the five genders of the Bugis.  There are divergent theories regarding the definitive origins and meaning of "gender transcendent", as they are commonly called.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/29/IIASNL29_27.pdf |title=Sex, Gender, and Priests in South Sulawesi, Indonesia |publisher=[[International Institute for Asian Studies]] |accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For one to be considered ''bissu'', all aspects of gender must be combined to form a whole. It is believed that you are born with the propensity to become a Bissu, revealed in a baby whose genitalia are ambiguous. Ambiguous genitalia alone cannot ensure that you become a bissu. Moreover, these ambiguous genitalia need not be visible; a normative male who becomes a bissu is believed to be female on the inside. This combination of sexes enables a 'meta-gender' identity to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-66/sulawesi-s-fifth-gender-3007484 |title=Sulawesi's fifth gender |journal=[[Inside Indonesia]] |accessdate=2011-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728104208/http://www.insideindonesia.org/edition-66-apr-jun-2001/sulawesi-s-fifth-gender-3007484 |archive-date=28 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bugis society has a cultural belief that all five genders must co-exist harmoniously.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Calabai==
According to the Bugis gender system, ''calabai'' are false women and so are generally [[assigned male at birth]] but take on the role of heterosexual females. Their fashions and gender expression are distinctly feminine but do not match that of "typical" [[cisgender]] women.

{{quote|text=If there is to be a wedding in Bugis society, more often than not ''calabai'' will be involved in the organization. When a wedding date has been agreed upon, the family will approach a ''calabai'' and negotiate a wedding plan. The ''calabai'' will be responsible for many things: setting up and decorating the tent, arranging the bridal chairs, bridal gown, costumes for the groom and the entire wedding party (numbering up to twenty-five), makeup for all those involved, and all the food. Rarely did I attend a village wedding with less than a thousand guests. On the day, some ''calabai'' remain in the kitchen preparing food while others form part of the reception, showing guests to their seats. |author=Sharyn Graham |source=}}

==Calalai==
The ''calalai'' are [[assigned female at birth]] but take on the roles of heterosexual males. They dress and present themselves as men, hold masculine jobs and typically live with female partners to adopt children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Think Sociology |last=Carl |first=John D. |edition=2nd |publisher=Pearson |location=Upper Saddle River |year=2011 |oclc=663102354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3677">'''Joaquín María Bover de Roselló''' ([[Seville]], 1810 - [[Palma, Majorca|Palma de Mallorca]], 1865) was a Spanish writer and editor who wrote primarily in Spanish but also some poems in [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

== Development ==

Kannada is a Southern [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]], and according to Dravidian scholar Sanford B. Steever, its history can be conventionally divided into three periods: Old Kannada (''Halegannada'') from 450–1200 CE, Middle Kannada (''Nadugannada'') from 1200–1700, and Modern Kannada from 1700 to the present.&lt;ref name="steeve"&gt;Steever, S. B. (1998), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Kannada is influenced to an appreciable extent by Sanskrit. Influences of other languages such as [[Prakrit]] and [[Pali]] can also be found in the Kannada language. The scholar [[Iravatham Mahadevan]] indicated that Kannada was already a language of rich oral tradition earlier than the 3rd century BCE, and based on the native Kannada words found in Prakrit  inscriptions of that period, Kannada must have been spoken by a widespread and stable population.&lt;ref name="ciil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Classical Kannada, Antiquity of Kannada |url=http://www.classicalkannada.org/LanguageEng.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425022336/http://www.classicalkannada.org/LanguageEng.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 April 2010 |publisher=Central Institute for Indian Languages |work=Centre for classical Kannada |accessdate=28 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamil_epigraphy1" /&gt; The scholar K. V. Narayana claims that many tribal languages which are now designated as Kannada dialects could be nearer to the earlier form of the language, with lesser influence from other languages.&lt;ref name="ciil" /&gt;

== Sanskrit and Prakrit influence ==

The sources of influence on literary Kannada grammar appear to be three-fold: [[Pāṇini]]'s grammar, non-Paninian schools of [[Sanskrit]] grammar, particularly ''Katantra'' and ''Sakatayana'' schools, and [[Prakrit]] grammar.&lt;ref name=prak&gt;{{cite book|last=Mythic Society (Bangalore, India)|title=The quarterly journal of the Mythic society (Bangalore)., Volume 76|year=1985|publisher=Mythic Society (Bangalore, India)|pages=Pages_197–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary Prakrit  seems to have prevailed in Karnataka since ancient times. The vernacular Prakrit speaking people may have come into contact with Kannada speakers, thus influencing their language, even before Kannada was used for administrative or liturgical purposes. Kannada phonetics, morphology, vocabulary, grammar and syntax show significant influence from these languages.&lt;ref name=prak/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|author1=B. K. Khadabadi |author2=Prākr̥ta Bhāratī Akādamī |title=Studies in Jainology, Prakrit literature, and languages: a collection of select 51 papers Volume 116 of Prakrit Bharti pushpa|year=1997|publisher=Prakrit Bharati Academy,|pages=444 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some naturalised (''[[tadbhava]]'') words of Prakrit origin in Kannada are: ''baṇṇa'' (colour) derived from  ''vaṇṇa'', ''hunnime'' (full moon) from ''puṇṇivā''. Examples of naturalized Sanskrit words in Kannada are: ''varṇa'' (colour), ''arasu'' (king) from ''rajan'', ''paurṇimā'', and ''rāya'' from ''rāja'' (king).&lt;ref name=banna&gt;{{cite book|last=Jha|first=Ganganatha|title=Journal of the Ganganatha Jha Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Volume 32|year=1976|publisher=Ganganatha Jha Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha,|pages=see page 319}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like the other Dravidian languages Kannada also has borrowed (''[[tatsama]]'') words such as ''dina'' (day), ''kopa'' (anger), ''surya'' (sun), ''mukha'' (face), ''nimiṣa'' (minute) and ''anna'' (rice).&lt;ref name="tatsama"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulli|first=Jayavant S|title=History of grammatical theories in Kannada|year=1991|publisher=Internationial School of Dravidian Linguistics,|pages=330 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting this tradition, an inscription of about the 9th century CE, containing specimens of different alphabets, mostly Dravidian, was discovered in a Jain temple in the Deogarh fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Buddha-Dhamma, Or, the Life and Teachings of the Buddha, History of Kannada Language|last=R|first=Narasimhacharya|publisher=Asian Educational Services|year=1942|isbn=9788120605596|location=|pages=35–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek dramatists [[Euripides]] (480-406 BCE) and [[Aristophanes]] (446-386 BCE) of the 5th–4th century BCE were purportedly familiar with the Kannada country and language which can be concluded by the usage of Kannada words, phrases and expressions in their Greek plays along with Persian and Punic. This would show a far more intimate contact of the Greeks with Kannada culture than with Indian culture elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Appadurai |first=Sri K. |date=1997 |title=THE PLACE OF KANNADA AND TAMIL in INDIA'S NATIONAL CULTURE |url=http://www.intamm.com/journalism/ta-jour3.htm |journal=THE PLACE OF KANNADA AND TAMIL in INDia's NATIONAL CULTURE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415154722/http://www.intamm.com/journalism/ta-jour3.htm |archivedate=15 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kannada word ''Ooralli'' (''lit'' it means "in a village") is said to be written on a huge wall constructed in Alexandria in the 4th century BCE as part of the remnants of 36,000 palm manuscripts that had been burnt in an accidental fire in Alexander's time. The palm manuscripts contained texts written not only in Greek, Latin and Hebrew, but also in Sanskrit and Kannada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kannada-word-found-on-wall-in-egypt/article1393769.ece|title=Kannada word found on wall in Egypt|date=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some 3rd–1st century BCE Tamil inscriptions, words of Kannada influence such as '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''nalliyooraa'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'', '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''kavuDi'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''posil'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' have been introduced. The use of the vowel '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''a''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' as an adjective is not prevalent in Tamil but its usage is available in Kannada. Kannada words such as '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''gouDi-gavuDi'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' transform into Tamil’s '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''kavuDi'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' for lack of the usage of ''Ghosha svana'' in Tamil. Hence the Kannada word 'gavuDi' becomes 'kavuDi' in Tamil. 'Posil' ('hosilu') was introduced into Tamil from Kannada and colloquial Tamil uses this word as 'Vaayil'. In a 1st-century CE Tamil inscription, there is a personal reference to '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''ayjayya''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', a word of Kannada origin. In a 3rd-century CE Tamil inscription there is usage of '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''oppanappa vIran''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. Here the honorific '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''appa''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' to a person's name is an influence from Kannada. Another word of Kannada origin is '''taayviru''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' and is found in a 4th-century CE Tamil inscription. S. Settar studied the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''sittanvAsal''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' inscription of first century CE as also the inscriptions at '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''tirupparamkunram''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''adakala''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''neDanUpatti''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. The later inscriptions were studied in detail by Iravatham Mahadevan also. Mahadevan argues that the words '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''erumi''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''kavuDi''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''poshil''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''tAyiyar''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' have their origin in Kannada because Tamil cognates are not available. Settar adds the words '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''nADu''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''iLayar''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' to this list. Mahadevan feels that some grammatical categories found in these inscriptions are also unique to Kannada rather than Tamil. Both these scholars attribute these influences to the movements and spread of Jainas in these regions. These inscriptions belong to the period between the first century BCE and fourth century CE. These are some examples that are proof of the influence of Kannada on Tamil before the common era and in the early centuries of the common era.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ellakavi.wordpress.com/2007/11/12/it-is-necessary-for-kannadigas-to-know-about-the-greatness-of-their-language-which-most-are-not-aware-of/|title=Kannada, Kannadiga, Kannadigaru, Karnataka|last=Nagarajaiah|first=Hampa|date=12 November 2007|publisher=ellakavi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331034917/http://www.classicalkannada.org:80/DataBase/KannwordHTMLS/CLASSICAL%20KANNADA%20LANGUAGE%20HTML/ANTIQUITY%20OF%20KANNADA.htm|title=Antiquity of Kannada|date=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DZBkAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Early+Tamil+Epigraphy&amp;q=posil|title=Early Tamil Epigraphy|isbn=9780674012271|last1=Mahadevan|first1=Iravatham|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 150 CE Prakrit book ''Gaathaa Saptashati'', written by Haala Raja, Kannada words like ''tIr or Teer (''meaning ''to be able)'', ''tuppa'', ''peTTu'', ''poTTu, poTTa, piTTu (''meaning ''to strike), Pode (Hode)'' have been used. On the Pallava Prakrit inscription of 250 CE of Hire Hadagali's Shivaskandavarman, the Kannada word ''kOTe'' transforms into ''koTTa''. In the 350 CE Chandravalli Prakrit inscription, words of Kannada origin like ''punaaTa'', ''puNaDa'' have been used. In one more Prakrit inscription of 250 CE found in Malavalli, Kannada towns like ''vEgooraM'' (''bEgooru''), ''kundamuchchaMDi'' find a reference.&lt;ref name="Tamil_epigraphy1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/131873/7/07_chapter%202.pdf|title=Karnataka history|last=|first=|date=|website=ShodhGanga|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] (23 – 79 CE) was a naval and army commander in the early Roman Empire. He writes about pirates between Muziris and Nitrias (Netravati River). He also mentions Barace (Barcelore). Nitrias of Pliny and Nitran of Ptolemy refer to the Netravati River as also{{clarify|date=October 2016}} the modern port city of [[Mangaluru]], upon its mouth. Many of these are Kannada origin names of places and rivers of the Karnataka coast of 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=78I5lDHU2jQC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=ptolemy+nitran#v=onepage&amp;q=ptolemy%20nitran&amp;f=false|title=Some Early Dynasties of South India|last=Chattopadhyaya|first=Sudhakar|date=1 January 1974|website=|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=9788120829411|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muzirisheritage.org/history.php|title=Muziris Heritage Project|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commerce between the Roman Empire and India|last=Warmington|first=E.

The Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]] (150 CE) mentions places such as Badiamaioi (Badami), Inde (Indi), Kalligeris (Kalkeri), Modogoulla (Mudagal), Petrigala (Pattadakal), Hippokoura (Huvina Hipparagi), Nagarouris (Nagur), Tabaso (Tavasi), Tiripangalida (Gadahinglai), Soubouttou or Sabatha (Savadi), Banaouase (Banavasi), Thogorum (Tagara), Biathana (Paithan), Sirimalaga (Malkhed), Aloe (Ellapur) and Pasage (Palasige) indicating prosperous trade between Egypt, Europe and Karnataka. He also mentions Pounnata (Punnata) and refers to beryls, i.e., the ''Vaidhurya'' gems of that country. He mentions Malippala (Malpe) a coastal town of Karnataka. In this work Larika and Kandaloi are identified as Rastrika and Kuntala. Ptolemy writes in the midst of the false mouth and the Barios, there is a city called Maganur (Mangalore). He mentions of inland centres of pirates called Oloikhora (Alavakheda). He mentions Ariake Sadinon meaning Aryaka Satakarni and Baithana as capital of Siro(e) P(t)olmaios, i.e., Sri Pulimayi clearly indicating his knowledge of the Satavahana kings. The word ''Pulimayi'' means ''One with body of Tiger'' in Kannada, which bears testimony to the possible Kannada origin of Satavahana kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://storyofkannada.blogspot.in/2009/04/greece-and-kannada-in-classical-era.html#.Vtr_mvl94sk|title=Story of Kannadiga, Kannada and Karnataka.

A possibly more definite reference to Kannada is found in the '[[Charition mime|Charition Mime]]' ascribed to the late 1st to early 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Suryanatha Kamath – Karnataka State Gazetteer – South Kanara (1973), Printed by the Director of Print, Stationery and Publications at the Govt. Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manohar Laxman Varadpande – History of Indian theatre, Volume 3 (1987), Abhinav Publications, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; The farce, written by an unknown author, is concerned with a Greek lady named Charition who has been stranded on the coast of a country bordering the Indian Ocean. The king of this region, and his countrymen, sometimes use their own language, and the sentences they speak could be interpreted as Kannada, including ''Koncha madhu patrakke haki'' ("Having poured a little wine into the cup separately") and ''paanam beretti katti madhuvam ber ettuvenu'' ("Having taken up the cup separately and having covered it, I shall take wine separately.").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;D.

The corrupt lines indicate that the text found at Oxyrhynchus (Egypt) has been copied, meaning that the original was even earlier in date. Wilamowitz (1907) and Andreassi (2001) say that for more precise dating of the original, some place the composition of the work as early as in the Hellenistic period (332-30 BCE), others at a later date, up to the early 2nd c.

The earliest examples of a full-length Kannada language stone inscription (''shilaashaasana'') containing [[Brahmi]] characters with characteristics attributed to those of [[Halegannada|proto-Kannada]] in ''Hale Kannada'' (''lit'' Old Kannada) script can be found in the [[Halmidi inscription]], usually dated c. AD 450, indicating that Kannada had become an administrative language at that time.

Kannada inscriptions are not only discovered in Karnataka but also quite commonly in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Some inscriptions were also found in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The Northern most Kannada inscription of the Rashtrakutas of 964 CE is the Jura record found near Jabalpur in present-day Madhya Pradesh, belonging to the reign of Krishna III.

It is a writing on literary criticism and poetics meant to standardise various written Kannada dialects used in literature in previous centuries. The book makes reference to Kannada works by early writers such as King [[Durvinita]] of the 6th century and Ravikirti, the author of the Aihole record of 636 AD.&lt;ref name="extinct_works6"&gt;Sastri (1955), p355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamath (2001), p90&lt;/ref&gt; Since the earliest available Kannada work is one on grammar and a guide of sorts to unify existing variants of [[Kannada grammar]] and literary styles, it can be safely assumed that literature in Kannada must have started several centuries earlier.&lt;ref name="extinct_works6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extinct_works5"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Kannada Literature-I |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/kar/literature/history1.htm |author=Jyotsna Kamat |publisher=Kamat's Potpourri |work=Kamat's Potpourri, 4 November 2006 |accessdate=25 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early [[Extant literature|extant]] prose work, the ''Vaddaradhane'' (ವಡ್ಡಾರಾಧನೆ) by [[Shivakotiacharya]] of AD 900 provides an elaborate description of the life of Bhadrabahu of [[Shravanabelagola]].&lt;ref name="kavirajamarga"&gt;Sastri (1955), p356&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the 9th century, Old Kannada was spoken from [[Kaveri]] to [[Godavari]]. The Kannada spoken between the rivers [[Varada]] and [[Malaprabha]] was the pure well of Kannada undefiled.&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|9788120605596}}"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Narasimhacharya|first1=R.|title=History of Kannada Language|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=yhXRDSgBuL0C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=tulu&amp;f=false|publisher=Asian Educational Services, 1942|isbn=9788120605596|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late classical period gave birth to several genres of Kannada literature, with new forms of composition coming into use, including ''Ragale'' (a form of blank verse) and meters like ''Sangatya'' and ''Shatpadi''. The works of this period are based on [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] principles. Two of the early writers of this period are [[Harihara (poet)|Harihara]] and Raghavanka, trailblazers in their own right. Harihara established the ''Ragale'' form of composition while [[Raghavanka]] popularised the ''Shatpadi'' (six-lined stanza) meter.&lt;ref name="hari"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp&amp;nbsp;361–2&lt;/ref&gt; A famous [[Jainism|Jaina]] writer of the same period is [[Janna]], who expressed Jain religious teachings through his works.&lt;ref name="jan"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p20&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vachana|Vachana Sahitya]] tradition of the 12th century is purely native and unique in world literature, and the sum of contributions by all sections of society. Vachanas were pithy poems on that period's social, religious and economic conditions. More importantly, they held a mirror to the seed of social revolution, which caused a radical re-examination of the ideas of caste, creed and religion. Some of the important writers of Vachana literature include [[Basavanna]], [[Allama Prabhu]] and [[Akka Mahadevi]].&lt;ref name="akka"&gt;Sastri (1955), p361&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I of 850 CE recognised that the Sanskrit style of Kannada literature was ''Margi'' (formal or written form of language) and ''Desi'' (folk or spoken form of language) style was popular and made his people aware of the strength and beauty of their native language Kannada. In 1112 CE, Jain poet Nayasena of Mulugunda, Dharwad district, in his Champu work ''Dharmamrita'' (ಧರ್ಮಾಮೃತ), a book on morals, warns writers from mixing Kannada with Sanskrit by comparing it with mixing of clarified butter and oil. He has written it using very limited Sanskrit words which fit with idiomatic Kannada. In 1235 CE, Jain poet Andayya, wrote ''Kabbigara Kava''- ಕಬ್ಬಿಗರ ಕಾವ  (Poet's Defender), also called ''Sobagina Suggi'' (Harvest of Beauty) or ''Madana-Vijaya and'' ''Kavana-Gella'' (Cupid's Conquest)'','' a ''Champu'' work in pure Kannada using only indigenous (''desya'') Kannada words and the derived form of Sanskrit words – ''tadbhavas'', without the admixture of Sanskrit words. He succeeded in his challenge and proved wrong those who had advocated that it was impossible to write a work in Kannada without using Sanskrit words. Andayya may be considered as a protector of Kannada poets who were ridiculed by Sanskrit advocates. Thus Kannada is the only Dravidian language which is not only capable of using only native Kannada words and grammar in its literature (like Tamil), but also use Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary (like Telugu, Malayalam, Tulu, etc.) The Champu style of literature of mixing poetry with prose owes its origins to the Kannada language which was later incorporated by poets into Sanskrit and other Indian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dqGojPpe8DIC&amp;dq=andayya+pure+kannada|title=Indian Literature|last=Nagendra|first=Dr.|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan, 1988|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nOTmIt3wumwC&amp;dq=andayya+pure+kannada|title=History of Kannada Literature: Readership Lectures|last=Narasimhacharya|first=Ramanujapuram|publisher=Asian Educational Services, 1988|isbn=9788120603035|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;dq=andayya|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: A-Devo|last=Datta|first=Amaresh|publisher=Sahitya Akademi, 1987|isbn=9788126018031|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y2noBgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=nayasena+a+jain|title=Gods, Heroes and their Story Tellers: Intangible cultural heritage of South India|last=Hari Saravanan|first=V.|publisher=Notion Press, 2014|isbn=9789384391492|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kannada literature"&gt;Rice, Edward.

===Middle Kannada===
{{Main article|Kannada literature in Vijayanagara empire|Literature of the Kingdom of Mysore}}
During the period between the 15th and 18th centuries, [[Hinduism]] had a great influence on Middle Kannada (''Nadugannada''- ನಡುಗನ್ನಡ) language and literature. [[Kumara Vyasa]], who wrote the ''Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari'' (ಕರ್ಣಾಟ ಭಾರತ ಕಥಾಮಂಜರಿ), was arguably the most influential Kannada writer of this period. His work, entirely composed in the native ''Bhamini Shatpadi'' (hexa-meter), is a sublime adaptation of the first ten books of the [[Mahabharata]].&lt;ref name="kumar"&gt;Sastri (1955), p364&lt;/ref&gt; 
During this period, the Sanskritic influence is present in most abstract, religious, scientific and rhetorical terms.&lt;ref name="influence"&gt;"Literature in all Dravidian languages owes a great deal to Sanskrit, the magic wand whose touch raised each of the languages from a level of patois to that of a literary idiom".

Hindu saints of the [[Vaishnava]] sect such as [[Kanakadasa]], [[Purandaradasa]], [[Naraharitirtha]], [[Vyasatirtha]], [[Sripadaraya]], [[Vadirajatirtha]], [[Vijaya Dasa]], [[Jagannatha Dasa]], Prasanna Venkatadasa produced devotional poems in this period.&lt;ref name="bhakti"&gt;Sastri (1955), pp&amp;nbsp;364–365&lt;/ref&gt; Kanakadasa's ''Ramadhanya Charite'' (ರಾಮಧಾನ್ಯ ಚರಿತೆ ) is a rare work, concerning with the issue of class struggle.&lt;ref name="ragi"&gt;The writing exalts the grain Ragi above all other grains that form the staple foods of much of modern Karnataka (Sastri 1955, p365)&lt;/ref&gt; This period saw the advent of ''[[Haridasa]] Sahitya'' (''lit'' Dasa literature) which made rich contributions to ''[[Bhakti]]'' literature and sowed the seeds of Carnatic music.

===Modern Kannada===
{{Main article|Modern Kannada literature|Kannada poetry}}
The Kannada works produced from the 19th century make a gradual transition and are classified as ''Hosagannada'' or Modern Kannada. Most notable among the modernists was the poet Nandalike Muddana whose writing may be described as the "Dawn of Modern Kannada", though generally, linguists treat ''Indira Bai'' or ''Saddharma Vijayavu'' by Gulvadi Venkata Raya as the first literary works in Modern Kannada. The first modern [[movable type]] printing of "Canarese" appears to be the ''Canarese Grammar'' of [[William Carey (missionary)|Carey]] printed at [[Serampore]] in 1817, and the "[[Bible translations into Kannada|Bible in Canarese]]" of [[John Hands]] in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Report on the administration of Mysore – Page 90 Mysore – 1864 "There is no authentic record of the casting of the first Early Canarese printing. Canarese type, but a Canarese Grammar by Carey printed at Serampore in 1817 is extant. About the same time a translation of the Scriptures was printed&lt;/ref&gt; The first novel printed was [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', along with other texts including ''Canarese Proverbs'', ''The History of Little Henry and his Bearer'' by [[Mary Martha Sherwood]], [[Christian Gottlob Barth]]'s ''Bible Stories'' and "a Canarese hymn book."&lt;ref&gt;Missions in south India – Page 56 Joseph Mullens – 1854 "Among those of the former are tracts on Caste, on the Hindu gods; Canarese Proverbs; Henry and his Bearer; the Pilgrim's Progress; Barth's Bible Stories; a Canarese hymn book"&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Kannada in the 20th century has been influenced by many movements, notably ''Navodaya'', ''Navya'', ''Navyottara'', ''Dalita'' and ''Bandaya''. Contemporary Kannada literature has been highly successful in reaching people of all classes in society. Further, Kannada has produced a number of prolific and renowned poets and writers such as [[Kuvempu]], [[Bendre]], and [[V K Gokak]]. Works of Kannada literature have received eight [[Jnanpith|Jnanpith awards]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|author=Special Correspondent |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article2468374.ece |title=The Hindu – Jnanpith for Kambar |publisher=Thehindu.com |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=The Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest number awarded to any Indian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html |title=Welcome to: Bhartiya Jnanpith |publisher=jnanpith.net |date= |accessdate=7 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013122739/http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
{{Main article|Kannada dialects}}
There is also a considerable difference between the spoken and written forms of the language. Spoken Kannada tends to vary from region to region. The written form is more or less consistent throughout Karnataka. The [[Ethnologue]] reports "about 20 dialects" of Kannada. Among them are [[Kundagannada]] (spoken exclusively in [[Kundapura]]), Nadavar-Kannada (spoken by [[Nadavaru]]), [[Havigannada]] (spoken mainly by [[Havyaka Brahmin|Havyaka Brahmins]]), [[Are Bhashe]] (spoken by Gowda community mainly in [[Madikeri]] and [[Sullia]] region of [[Dakshina Kannada]]), Malenadu Kannada (Sakaleshpur, Coorg, Shimoga, Chikmagalur), [[Sholaga language|Sholaga]], [[Gulbarga Kannada]], Dharawad Kannada etc. All of these dialects are influenced by their regional and cultural background. The one million [[Komarpant]]s in and around Goa speak their own dialect of Kannada, known as Halegannada. They are settled throughout Goa state, throughout Uttara Kannada district and Khanapur taluk of Belagavi district, Karnataka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Journey from Madras through the Countries of Mysore, Canara, and Malabar.

Ethnologue also classifies a group of four languages related to Kannada, which are, besides Kannada proper, [[Badaga language|Badaga]], [[Holiya language|Holiya]], [[Kurumba language|Kurumba]] and [[Urali language|Urali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kannada|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/lsi/lsi.php?volume=4&amp;pages=701#page/404/mode/2up|website=The Record News|publisher=DSAL, Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasik district of Maharashtra has a distinct tribe called 'Hatkar Kaanadi' people who speak a Kannada (Kaanadi) dialect with lot of old Kannada words.

R. Narasimhacharya considers [[Tulu language|Tulu]], [[Kodava language|Kodava]], [[Toda language|Toda]], [[Kota language (India)|Kota]], [[Badaga language|Badaga]] and [[Irula language|Irula]] as Kannada dialects due to their closeness to Kannada.&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|9788120605596}}"/&gt;

==Status==

The Director of the Central Institute of Indian Languages, Udaya Narayana Singh, submitted a report in 2006 to the Indian government arguing for Kannada to be made a classical language of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/04/stories/2006100419510100.htm|title=Kannada likely to get classical tag|last=K.N. Venkatasubba Rao|date=4 October 2006|work=The Hindu|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the Indian government announced that Kannada was to be designated as one of the classical languages of India.&lt;ref name="tag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oldest"/&gt;

==Writing system==
{{Main article|Kannada alphabet|Kannada braille}}

The language uses forty-nine [[phonemic]] letters, divided into three groups: ''swaragalu'' (vowels – thirteen letters); ''vyanjanagalu'' (consonants – thirty-four letters); and ''yogavaahakagalu'' (neither vowel nor consonant – two letters: ''[[anusvara]]'' {{lang|kn|ಂ}} and ''[[visarga]]'' {{lang|kn|ಃ}})&lt;!--Swaragalu+Yogavaahakagalu=vowels?--&gt;. The character set is almost identical to that of other [[Languages of India|Indian languages]]. The Kannada script is almost perfectly phonetic, but for the sound of a "half n" (which becomes a half m). The number of written symbols, however, is far more than the forty-nine characters in the alphabet, because different characters can be combined to form ''compound'' characters ''(ottakshara)''. Each written symbol in the Kannada script corresponds with one [[syllable]], as opposed to one [[phoneme]] in languages like English. The Kannada script is syllabic.

== Dictionary ==
Kannada–Kannada dictionary has existed in Kannada along with ancient works of Kannada grammar. The oldest available Kannada dictionary was composed by the poet 'Ranna' called 'Ranna Kanda' (ರನ್ನ ಕಂದ) in 996 ACE. Other dictionaries are 'Abhidhana Vastukosha' (ಅಭಿದಾನ ವಾಸ್ತುಕೋಶ)  by Nagavarma (1045 ACE), 'Amarakoshada Teeku'(ಅಮರಕೋಶದ ತೀಕು) by Vittala (1300), 'Abhinavaabhidaana'(ಅಭಿನವಾಭಿದಾನ) by Abhinava Mangaraja (1398 ACE) and many more.&lt;ref&gt;N Ucida and B B Rajpurohit, http://www.aa.tufs.ac.jp/~tjun/data/kandic/kannada-english_dictionary.pdf, Kannada-English Etymological Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; A Kannada–English dictionary consisting of more than 70,000 words was composed by [[Ferdinand Kittel]].&lt;ref name="kittel"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kannada Dialect Dictionaries and Dictionaries in Subregional Languages of Karnataka|url=http://www.languageinindia.com/sep2005/kannadadictionary1.html|author=Manjulakshi &amp; Bhat|publisher=Central Institute of Indian Languages, University of Mysore|work=Language in India, Volume 5: 9 September 2005|accessdate=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Main article|Kannada grammar}}

The canonical word order of Kannada is [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] (subject–object–verb) as is the case with Dravidian languages.
Kannada is a highly [[inflection|inflected]] language with three [[Grammatical gender|gender]]s (masculine, feminine, and neuter or common) and two numbers (singular and plural). It is inflected for gender, number and tense, among other things. The most authoritative known book on old Kannada grammar is ''[[Shabdhamanidarpana]]'' by [[Keshiraja]]. The first available Kannada book, a treatise on poetics, rhetoric and basic grammar is the ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' from 850 C.E.

The most influential account of Kannada grammar is [[Keshiraja]]'s ''[[Shabdamanidarpana]]'' (c. AD 1260).&lt;ref name="GS Gai"&gt;''Studies in Indian History, Epigraphy, and Culture'' – By Govind Swamirao Gai, pp. 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F. Kittel, 'A Grammar of the Kannada Language'"&gt;''A Grammar of the Kannada Language''. F. Kittel (1993), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier grammatical works include portions of ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' (a treatise on ''alańkāra'') of the 9th century, and ''Kavyavalokana'' and ''Karnatakabhashabhushana'' (both authored by [[Nagavarma II]] in the first half of the 12th century).&lt;ref name="F. Kittel, 'A Grammar of the Kannada Language'" /&gt;

===Compound bases===
Compound bases, called ''samāsa'' in Kannada, are a set of two or more words compounded together.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Kittel, pp. 30&lt;/ref&gt; There are several types of compound bases, based on the rules followed for compounding. The types of compound bases or samāsas: tatpurusha, karmadhāraya, dvigu, bahuvreehi, anshi, dvandva, kriya and gamaka samāsa.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} Examples: ''taṅgāḷi'', ''hemmara'', ''kannusanne''.

===Pronouns===
In many ways the third-person pronouns are more like demonstratives than like the other pronouns. They are pluralized like nouns and whereas the first- and second-person pronouns have different ways to distinguish number.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat, D.N.S. 2004. ''Pronouns.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language engineering''' involves the creation of [[natural language processing]] systems, whose cost and outputs are measurable and predictable.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} It is a distinct field contrasted to natural language processing and [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1351324999002144] Hamish Cunnigham, ''Natural Language Engineering''  (1999), 5: 1-16 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; A recent trend of language engineering is the use of Semantic Web technologies for the creation, archiving, processing, and retrieval of machine processable language data.&lt;ref&gt;Shiyong Lu, Dapeng Liu, Farshad Fotouhi, Ming Dong, Robert Reynolds, Anthony Aristar, Martha Ratliff, Geoff Nathan, Joseph Tan, and Ronald Powell, "Language Engineering for the Semantic Web: a Digital Library for Endangered Languages", ''Information Research,'' 9(3), April, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Language families of Asia.png|thumb|450px|Of the many language families of Asia, Indo-European (purple, blue, and medium green) and Sino-Tibetan (chartreuse and pink) dominate numerically, while Altaic families (grey, bright green, and maroon) occupy large areas geographically. Regionally dominant families are Japonic in Japan, Austronesian in the Malay Archipelago (dark red), Kadai and Mon–Khmer in Southeast Asia (azure and peach), Dravidian in South India (khaki), Turkic in Central Asia (grey), and Semitic in the Mideast (orange).]]
There is a wide variety of [[language]]s spoken throughout [[Asia]], comprising different language families and some unrelated isolates. The major language families spoken on the continent include [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]], [[Mongolic languages|Siberian]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]]. They usually have a long tradition of writing, but not always.

==Language groups==
[[File:Ethnolinguisticswasiacia.jpg|thumb|300px|Ethnolinguistic distribution in Central/Southwest Asia of the [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian]], [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] (Hamito-Semitic) and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] families.]]
The major families in terms of numbers are [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] in South Asia and [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] in East Asia. Several other families are regionally dominant.

===Sino-Tibetan===
{{main article|Sino-Tibetan languages}}
Sino-Tibetan includes [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Karen languages|Karen]] and numerous languages of the Tibetan Plateau, southern China, Burma, and North east India.

===Indo-European===
{{main article|Indo-Iranian languages|Slavic languages|Armenian languages|Anatolian languages|Tocharian languages}}
The [[Indo-European languages]] are primarily represented by the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian branch]]. The family includes both [[Indic languages|Indic]] languages ([[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] and other languages spoken primarily in [[South Asia]]) and [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ([[Persian language|Persian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]] and other languages spoken primarily in Iran, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Central Asia, the Caucasus and parts of South Asia). In addition, other branches of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] spoken in Asia include the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] branch, which includes [[Russian language|Russian]] in [[Siberia]]; [[Greek language|Greek]] around the [[Black Sea]]; and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]; as well as extinct languages such as [[Hittite language|Hittite]] of Anatolia and [[Tocharian language|Tocharian]] of (Chinese) Turkestan.

===Altaic families===
{{main article|Altaic languages}}
A number of smaller, but important language families spread across central and northern Asia have long been linked in an as-yet unproven Altaic family. These are the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] (including [[Manchu language|Manchu]]), [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]], and [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] languages. Speakers of the [[Turkish language]] ([[Anatolian Turks]]) are believed to have adopted the language, having instead originally spoken the [[Anatolian languages]], an extinct group of languages belonging to the Indo-European family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11078479|doi=10.1086/316890|authors=Z. Rosser et al.|title=Y-Chromosomal Diversity in Europe is Clinal and Influenced Primarily by Geography, Rather than by Language|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=67|issue=6|pages=1526–1543|year=2000|pmc=1287948|url=http://evolutsioon.ut.ee/publications/Rosser2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mon–Khmer===
{{main article|Austroasiatic languages}}
The Mon–Khmer languages (also known as Austroasiatic) are the oldest family in Asia. Languages given official status are [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Khmer language|Khmer]] (Cambodian).

===Kra–Dai===
{{main article|Kra–Dai languages}}
The [[Kra–Dai languages]] (also known as Tai-Kadai) are found in southern China, Northeast India and Southeast Asia. Languages given official status are [[Thai language|Thai]] (Siamese) and [[Lao language|Lao]].

===Austronesian===
{{main article|Austronesian languages}}
The [[Austronesian languages]] are widespread throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], including major languages such as [[Fijian language|Fijian]] ([[Fiji]]), [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ([[Philippines]]), and [[Malay language|Malay]] ([[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Brunei]]). [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], and [[Madurese language|Madurese]] of [[Indonesia]] belong to this family as well.

===Dravidian===
{{main article|Dravidian languages}}
The Dravidian languages of southern India and parts of Sri Lanka include [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], and [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], while smaller languages such as [[Gondi language|Gondi]] and [[Brahui language|Brahui]] are spoken in central India and Pakistan respectively.

===Afro-Asiatic===
{{main article|Semitic languages}}
The [[Afroasiatic languages]] (in older sources Hamito-Semitic), particularly its [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch, are spoken in [[Western Asia]]. It includes [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], in addition to extinct languages such as [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. The [[Modern South Arabian languages]] contain a [[substratum]] influence from the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of Afroasiatic, which suggests that Cushitic speakers originally inhabited the Arabian Peninsula alongside Semitic speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blažek|first=Václav|title=Afroasiatic Migrations: Linguistic Evidence|url=http://www.phil.muni.cz/jazyk/files/AAmigrationsCORR.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siberian families===
{{main article|Paleosiberian languages}}
Besides the Altaic families already mentioned (of which Tungusic is today a minor family of Siberia), there are a number of small language families and isolates spoken across northern Asia. These include the [[Uralic languages]] of western Siberia (better known for Hungarian and Finnish in Europe), the [[Yeniseian languages]] ([[Dené–Yeniseian languages|linked]] to Turkic and to the Athabaskan languages of North America), [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]], [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]] of Sakhalin, [[Ainu languages|Ainu]] of northern Japan, [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]] in easternmost Siberia, and—just barely—[[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]]. Some linguists have noted that the [[Koreanic languages]] share more similarities with the [[Paleosiberian languages]] than with the [[Altaic languages]]. The extinct [[Ruan-ruan language|Ruan-ruan]] language of Mongolia is unclassified, and does not show genetic relationships with any other known language family.

===Caucasian families===
{{main article|Languages of the Caucasus}}
Three small families are spoken in the [[Caucasus]]: [[Kartvelian languages]], such as [[Georgian language|Georgian]]; [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] (Dagestanian languages), such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]]; and [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]], such as [[Circassian language|Circassian]]. The latter two may be related to each other. The extinct [[Hurro-Urartian languages]] may be related as well.

===Small families of Southern Asia===
Although dominated by major languages and families, there are number of minor families and isolates in [[South Asia]] &amp; [[Southeast Asia]]. From west to east, these include:
*extinct languages of the [[Fertile Crescent]] such as [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Proto-Euphratean language|Proto-Euphratean]]
*extinct languages of South Asia: the unclassified [[Harappan language|Harappan]] language
*small language families and isolates of the [[Indian subcontinent]]: [[Burushaski]], [[Kusunda language|Kusunda]], and [[Nihali language|Nihali]]. The [[Vedda language|Vedda]] language of [[Sri Lanka]] is likely an isolate that has mixed with [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]].
*the two [[Andamanese languages|Andamanese]] language families: [[Great Andamanese languages|Great Andamanese]] and [[Ongan languages|Ongan]]; [[Sentinelese language|Sentinelese]] remains undocumented to date, and hence unclassified.
*isolates and languages with isolate [[substratum|substrata]] of Southeast Asia: [[Kenaboi language|Kenaboi]], [[Enggano language|Enggano]], and the [[Philippine Negrito languages]] [[Manide language|Manide]] and [[Umiray Dumagat language|Umiray Dumagat]]
*[[Language isolates and independent language families in Arunachal]]: [[Digaro languages|Digaro]], [[Hrusish languages|Hrusish]] (including the [[Miji languages]]&lt;ref name="Blench2015"&gt;Blench, Roger. 2015. [https://www.academia.edu/12657496/The_Mijiic_languages_distribution_dialects_wordlist_and_classification ''The Mijiic languages: distribution, dialects, wordlist and classification'']. m.s.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Midzu languages|Midzu]], [[Puroik language|Puroik]], [[Siangic languages|Siangic]], and [[Kho-Bwa languages|Kho-Bwa]]
*[[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] (Miao–Yao) scattered across southern China and Southeast Asia
*several "[[Papuan languages|Papuan]]" families of the central and eastern Malay Archipelago: languages of [[Halmahera languages|Halmahera]], [[East Timor languages|East Timor]], and the extinct [[Tambora language|Tambora]] of [[Sumbawa]]. Numerous additional families are spoken in Indonesian [[New Guinea]], but this lies outside the scope of an article on Asian languages.

===Creoles and pidgins===
{{main article|Creole languages|Pidgin language}}
The eponymous [[Chinese Pidgin English|pidgin]] ("business") language developed with European trade in China. Of the many creoles to have developed, the most spoken today are [[Chavacano]], a [[Spanish-based creole]] of the Philippines, and various [[Malay-based creoles]] such as [[Manado Malay]] influenced by [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. A very well-known Portuguese-based creole is the [[Kristang language|Kristang]], which is spoken in [[Malacca]], a city-state in [[Malaysia]].

===Sign languages===
{{main article|Sign language|List of sign languages#Asia/Pacific}}
A number of sign languages are spoken throughout Asia. These include the [[Japanese Sign Language family]], [[Chinese Sign Language]], [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]], as well as a number of small indigenous sign languages of countries such as [[Nepali Sign Language|Nepal]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnamese sign languages|Vietnam]]. Many official sign languages are part of the [[French Sign Language family]].

==Official languages==
{{main article|List of official languages by state}}
Asia and Europe are the only two continents where most countries use native languages as their [[official languages]], though English is also widespread.

The dozen '''Luo''', '''Lwo''' or '''Lwoian''' languages are spoken by the [[Luo peoples]] in an area ranging from southern [[Sudan]] to southern [[Kenya]], with [[Dholuo language|Dholuo]] extending into northern [[Tanzania]] and [[Alur language|Alur]] into the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. They form one of the two branches of the [[Western Nilotic languages|Western Nilotic]] family, the other being [[Dinka–Nuer languages|Dinka–Nuer]]. The Southern Luo varieties are [[mutually intelligible]], and apart from ethnic identity they might be considered a single language.

The time depth of the division of the Luo languages is moderate, perhaps close to two millennia. The division within the [[Southern Luo]] dialect cluster is considerably shallower, perhaps five to eight centuries, reflecting migrations due to the impact of the [[Islamization of Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bethwell Ogot]], ''History of the Southern Luo: Volume 1, Migration and Settlement''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6669">In the theory of [[formal language]]s, the '''Myhill–Nerode theorem''' provides a [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient condition]] for a language to be [[regular language|regular]]. The theorem is named for [[John Myhill]] and [[Anil Nerode]], who proved it at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1958 {{harv|Nerode|1958}}.

==Statement of the theorem==
Given a language ''L'', and a pair of strings ''x'' and ''y'', define a  '''distinguishing extension''' to be a string ''z'' such that
exactly one of the two strings ''xz'' and ''yz'' belongs to ''L''.
Define a relation ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' on strings by the rule that ''x R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; y'' if there is no distinguishing extension for ''x'' and ''y''.  It is easy to show that ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an [[equivalence relation]] on strings, and thus it divides the set of all strings into  [[equivalence class]]es.

The Myhill–Nerode theorem states that ''L'' is regular if and only if ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' has a finite number of equivalence classes, and moreover that the number of states in the smallest [[deterministic finite automaton]] (DFA) recognizing ''L'' is equal to the number of equivalence classes in ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''. In particular, this implies that there is a unique [[DFA minimization|minimal DFA]] with minimum number of states {{harv|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}.

==Proof==
If ''L'' is a regular language, then by definition there is a DFA ''A'' that recognizes it, with only finitely many states. If there are ''n'' states, then partition the set of all finite strings into ''n'' subsets, where subset ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the set of strings that, when given as input to automaton ''A'', cause it to end in state ''i''. For every two strings ''x'' and ''y'' that belong to the same subset, and for every choice of a third string ''z'', automaton ''A'' reaches the same state on input ''xz'' as it reaches on input ''yz'', and therefore must either accept both of the inputs ''xz'' and ''yz'' or reject both of them. Therefore, no string ''z'' can be a distinguishing extension for ''x'' and ''y'', so they must be related by ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''. Thus, ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a subset of an equivalence class of ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''. Combining this fact with the fact that every member of one of these equivalence classes belongs to one of the sets ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', this gives a many-to-one relation from states of ''A'' to equivalence classes, implying that the number of equivalence classes is finite and at most ''n''.

In the other direction, suppose that ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' has finitely many equivalence classes. In this case, it is possible to design a deterministic finite automaton that has one state for each equivalence class. The start state of the automaton corresponds to the equivalence class containing the empty string, and the transition function from a state ''X'' on input symbol ''y'' takes the automaton to a new state, the state corresponding to the equivalence class containing string ''xy'', where ''x'' is an arbitrarily chosen string in the equivalence class for ''X''. The definition of the Myhill–Nerode relation implies that the transition function is well-defined: no matter which representative string ''x'' is chosen for state ''X'', the same transition function value will result. A state of this automaton is accepting if the corresponding equivalence class contains a string in ''L''; in this case, again, the definition of the relation implies that all strings in the same equivalence class must also belong to ''L'', for otherwise the empty string would be a distinguishing string for some pairs of strings in the class.

Thus, the existence of a finite automaton recognizing ''L'' implies that the Myhill–Nerode relation has a finite number of equivalence classes, at most equal to the number of states of the automaton, and the existence of a finite number of equivalence classes implies the existence of an automaton with that many states.

==Use and consequences==
The Myhill–Nerode theorem may be used to show that a language ''L'' is [[regular language|regular]] by proving that the number of equivalence classes of ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is finite. This may be done by an exhaustive [[Proof by cases|case analysis]] in which, beginning from the [[empty string]], distinguishing extensions are used to find additional equivalence classes until no more can be found. For example, the language consisting of binary representations of numbers that can be divided by 3 is regular. Given the empty string, ''00'' (or ''11''), ''01'' and ''10'' are distinguishing extensions resulting in the three classes (corresponding to numbers that give remainders 0, 1 and 2 when divided by 3), but after this step there is no distinguishing extension anymore. The minimal automaton accepting our language would have three states corresponding to these three equivalence classes.

Another immediate [[corollary]] of the theorem is that if a language defines an infinite set of equivalence classes, it is ''not'' regular.  It is this corollary that is frequently used to prove that a language is not regular.

== Generalization ==
The Myhill–Nerode theorem can be generalized to trees. See [[tree automaton]].

'''Palya Lankesh''' (8 March 1935 – 25 January 2000) was an Indian poet, fiction writer, playwright, translator, screenplay writer and journalist who wrote in the [[Kannada]] language. He was also an award-winning film director.

== Early life and career ==

Lankesh was born in the small village of Konagavalli in [[Shimoga]], Karnataka. After graduating with an honours degree in English from Central College at [[Bengaluru]], Lankesh completed his [[Master of Arts]] degree in English from [[Maharaja's College, Mysore|Maharaja's College]], Mysore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Down memory lane|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/down-memory-lane/article2271841.ece|accessdate=7 December 2017|work=The Hindu|date=16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Manake Karanjiya Sparsha''. Compiled by Gauri Lankesh.Lankesh Prakashana.Bengaluru(2010) page i&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1976 film ''[[Pallavi (1976 film)|Pallavi]]''—a cinematic narration, told from the female protagonist's point of view and based on his novel ''Biruku''—won the National Award for Best Direction (Swarna Kamal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elitist double standards?|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1976-national-film-awards-mrinal-sens-mrigaya-selected-for-golden-lotus-award/1/435697.html|accessdate=3 December 2017|work=India Today|date=15 September 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lankesh quit his job as an assistant professor in English at [[Bangalore University]] in 1980 and started Lankesh Patrike, the first Kannada tabloid, which influenced Kannada culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;''Manake Karanjiya Sparsha''. Compiled by Gauri Lankesh. Lankesh Prakashana.Bengaluru(2010) page i&lt;/ref&gt;

Lankesh's first work was the collection of short stories ''Kereya Neeranu Kerege Chelli'' (1963).

'''Pervomaiskyi''' ({{lang-uk|Первомайський}}) is a city in [[Kharkiv Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]) of [[Ukraine]], formerly known as '''Likhachove'''. Administratively, it is incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]]. It also serves as the administrative center of [[Pervomaiskyi Raion, Kharkiv Oblast|Pervomaiskyi Raion]] though administratively it does not belong to the raion. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2017|30,389}} It is the fourth largest city in Kharkiv Oblast.

The city is known for [[Khimprom]], one of the biggest chemical factories in the former USSR.  The city has lush green plots and parks, a cultural center named "DK Khimik" and a stadium also named "Khimik".

==History==
In 1869 a railway was opened, Kursk-Kharkiv-Sevastopol. In August of the same year a whistle stop was built 80 kilometres from [[Kharkiv]]. Trains stopped for water and firewood and the station was named Likhachevo, in honour of a squire Likhachov, whose estate was near a village Sivash in a few kilometres from the railway. Water was supplied from lake Sivash and a water-tower was built.

After the [[Russian Civil War]] the (joint) Alekseevskogo, Berekskogo, Upper Bishkinskogo rural Soviets decided to relocate the peasants of these villages to the farm Likhachevo. So in 1924 a settlement was built in Likhachevo which originally was under the jurisdiction of the Upper Bishkinskyi village council. The founders of the village were migrants from the villages of Alexeevka, Bereka, Maslivka, and Upper-Bishkin. They built streets, such as 1 May Street. Agriculture and crafts schools were built, along with a primary school, which both children and adults attended.

In 1927 the village had 13 lots and 56 residents. In 1928, it was already 85 lots. The population increased as workers came to work at the brick and mechanical plant, as well as the mill. In September 1929, on the initiative of activists Tolokneeva and Fedoseenko, a gang was organized in the village. At the suggestion of porters, it was called "May 1" in honor of the international proletarian holiday. In early December 1929 Lihachevsky machine-tractor station was organized (one of the first in the Kharkiv district). Lihachevsky MTS first served 30 collective Alexeevski district.

According to the Soviet census of 1939, 640 people lived in Likhachevo.

On 20 October 1941 the Nazis occupied Likhachevo. 38 boys and girls were sent to work as slave laborers in Germany. 15 people from the village joined the partisans in Alexeevski district, whose leaders were Secretary of the Communist Party VS Ulyanov and executive committee chairman AG Buznyka.

Likhachevo repeatedly became the site of fierce fighting. During the war, it changed hands four times. On 16 September 1943 troops of the Steppe Front finally returned Likhachevo to Soviet control.

In 1946 a midwifery unit began to operate in the town. In 1948 a hospital was built, employing two doctors and three nurses.

In 1947 a kindergarten was built.

On 25 December 1948 Likhachevo became the center of the Council of Agriculture, who controlled the farm Pervomajskij, Our Way.

In 1950 a high school was built; its enrollment was 824 students and it employed 28 teachers.

On 24 June 1952 the settlement Likhachevo was renamed Pervomaiskyi.

[[File:Ukr Kh Pervomaiskyi Church Our Lady of Kazan 20.10.2018 (SU-HS) 5.jpg |thumb|200px|Church Our Lady of Kazan (2018)]]
Pervomaiskyi is situated on the Pivdenna Zalisnitsa railway line. The railway station here is called "Likhachove," or, in Russian, "Likhachevo". Pervomaiskyi is also a main road hub which links many other cities like [[Lozova]], [[Merefa]], [[Balakliia]] and [[Izium]] together with the Kharkiv Oblast.

==Economy==
Pervomaiskyi was planned as a colony for the workers and clerical staff of the Khimprom chemical factory. Until the fall of the [[USSR]] in 1992, the city's inhabitants had good earnings, but afterwards, the city's economy collapsed. Many became jobless. However in the late 1990s some private companies moved into Pervomaiskyi.

==Education==
Pervomaiskyi originally had just two schools till 1977. Now it has 7 secondary schools; one is Russian-medium, and the rest are Ukrainian-medium. Pervomaiskyi has 6-day-care centres (detski sad), which are all Ukrainian-medium. There is one college offering technical education after 9th Class in many fields like cooking, tractor building, driving, heavy wheel driving, and field fertilizing.

==Geography and climate==
As Pervomaiskyi lies just around 95&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Kharkiv]], its weather is similar. Pervomaiskyi's climate is moderate [[Continental climate|continental]]: cold and snowy winters, and hot summers. The seasonal average temperatures are not too cold in winter, not too hot in summer: {{convert|-6.9|°C|°F}} in January, and {{convert|20.3|°C|°F}} in July. The average rainfall totals {{convert|513|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year, with the most in June and July.

[[Image:Saken Sejfullin.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Postage stamp|Stamp]] of [[Kazakhstan]] devoted to S. Seyfullin, 2005]]
'''Saken Seyfullin''' ({{lang-kz|'''Сәкен Сейфуллин'''}}) (15 October 1894 – 28 February 1939) was a pioneer of modern Kazakh literature, poet and writer, and national activist. Founder and first head of the Union of Writers of Kazakhstan, he was the author of controversial literature calling for greater independence of Kazakhs from Soviet and Russian power. He met repression and was executed in 1939. The Soviet government posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] him during [[de-Stalinization]].

==Biography==
Seyfullin was born 15 October 1894 in a nomadic settlement in what is today [[Karaganda Region]].

===Education===
From 1905 to 1908, Seyfullin studied in a Russian-Kazakh school in the Spassk brass works. He went on to study in Akmola in the primary parish school and the Akmola three-class city school. In addition, he taught [[Russian language|Russian]] at a Muslim [[madrasah]]. On August 21 of 1913, Seifullin entered the [[Omsk]] teaching seminarium. His first article was published in the November edition of ''[[Ay Qap]]'' magazine. It was at this time that he began to be spied upon by the Omsk [[okhrana]], the secret police.

In 1914, Seyfullin became one of the heads of the first cultural and educational society of Kazakh youth, ''Birlik'' (Unity) in Omsk. His book of poetry (Past Days) was published that year.

In 1916, he worked on a property census commission for the 12 [[volost]]s of Akmola Uezd. In that year he wrote the poem ''Volnenie'' (Unrest), dedicated to Central Asian unrest in 1916. From September 1 of 1916 he taught in Bugula school, which he had a hand in founding.

On 9 March 1917 he moved to [[Akmola]], where he wrote a welcoming poem for the [[February revolution]], "Спешно собрались мы в поход". In April of that year, Seyfullin created a social-political and cultural society named Жас қазақ (Young Kazakh). In July, he conteibuted to an issue of ''Tirshilik'' (Life) newspaper. In September, Seyfullin began teaching three-month pedagogical courses in the new Russian-Kazakh school in [[Akmolinsk]].

Right after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], Seyfullin wrote a poem, "А ну-ка, джигиты!", which is said to be the first work of Kazakh Soviet literature. On 27 December 1917, the Soviet regime was established in Akmolinsk. Seyfullin was elected a member of the Akmola Deputy Board and was appointed national commissar of education. In February, he was admitted to the Party. On 1 May 1918 his play, "Бақыт жолына" (On the Way of Happiness), was performed for the first time.

===Civil War===
When on June 4, 1918, the [[White movement|White Guard]] conducted a revolution, Seyfullin was arrested and sent to [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]] jail. He was put in a [[Death Carriage]] of [[Ataman]] [[Michael Annenkoff]], where he spent 47 days. He broke out of [[Kolchak Prison]] and reached his village by July. After two months he was forced to flee for [[Taraz]].

===Capture and execution===
Seyfullin was arrested by the agents of the NKVD from Moscow in February 1939 and executed in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakh SSR]], deemed a "threat to the society" and a "nationalist". However, since [[Independence]], Saken Seyfullin is often considered one of the most influential Kazakh thinkers of the 21st century, a major contributor to Kazakh culture and literature, and a martyr for freedom.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

'''Section 17''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is one of the provisions of the ''Charter'' that addresses rights relating to [[Canada]]'s two [[official language]]s, [[English (language)|English]] and [[French (language)|French]].  While the section 17 right to use either language within the [[Parliament of Canada]] repeats a right already anchored in section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', section 17 also guarantees the right to use both languages in the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|legislature]] of [[New Brunswick]], the only officially bilingual province under [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 16 of the ''Charter'']].

==Text==
Section 17 reads,

{{cquote|17.(1)  Everyone has the right to use English or French in any debates and other proceedings of Parliament.

(2)  Everyone has the right to use English or French in any debates and other proceedings of the legislature of New Brunswick.}}

==Application==
As noted in the Supreme Court decision ''[[New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia]]'' (1993), the stated application of section 17 is to "Parliament."  This wording is an anomaly because technically Parliament is just an institution that enacts statutes.  The rights held under section 17, in contrast, presumably are not held against the statutes of Parliament but rather apply to the debates that occur within Parliamentary institutions, such as the [[House of Commons of Canada]] and [[Senate of Canada]].

This section, as it applies to Parliament, extends to Parliamentary committees, and thus any witness has a right to use either English or French if he or she appears before a committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/pdp-hrp/canada/guide/official_e.cfm#17 |title=Guide to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Program, Canadian Heritage |date= |accessdate= April 23, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221095848/http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/pdp-hrp/canada/guide/official_e.cfm |archivedate=21 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Michel Bastarache]] and his fellow-writers agree that section 17 applies to "other activities of Parliament," including Parliamentary committees, but argue that bilingualism in Parliamentary committees had been allowed for years prior to the Charter and interpreters had been provided.&lt;ref&gt;Bastarache, Michel, Andre Braen, Emmanuel Didier and Pierre Foucher, ''Language Rights in Canada'', ed. Michel Bastarache, trans. Translation Devinat et Associés, Ottawa, (Montréal, Quebec:  Editions Yvon Blais, 1987), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] building, where members may speak English or French.]]
As noted, the section also extends these constitutional rights to New Brunswick.  However, similar statutory rights in New Brunswick had already been in place when the ''Charter'' came to force.  Namely, they were in the Official Languages of New Brunswick Act.&lt;ref&gt;William Tetley, "Language and Education Rights in Quebec and Canada (A Legislative History and Personal Political Diary)," ''Law and Contemporary Problems'', Vol. 45, No. 4, Canadian Constitution, 1982. (Autumn, 1982), page 187.&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 17 thus constitutionalized the rights.

==Interpretation==
In the 1986 [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents]]'', Justice [[Jean Beetz]] found that section 17 was so similar to section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (section 17 was based on section 133) that section 17 would not represent any change in regard to rights that had belonged under section 133.  Thus, section 133 case law would influence section 17 case law.  Justice [[Bertha Wilson]], commenting on section 17's parallel with section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, also said that it could represent mere "constitutional continuity."  However, she did acknowledge that section 17 being exempt from the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]], and the [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|amending formula]] making Canada's language rights impossible to amend without the support from all provinces as well as the federal government, reveal language rights to be "a response to the peculiar facts of Canada's history."  At any rate, Beetz found that in Parliament, while section 17 guarantees a right for a person to speak in either French or English, depending on his or her preference, this does not extend to guaranteeing a right for the person's speech to be translated so all can understand it; the same line of reasoning had been used for section 133.

This line of thinking regarding section 133 also appeared in the Supreme Court case ''[[MacDonald v. City of Montreal]]'' (1986).  In ''MacDonald'', ''[[Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick]]'' (1975) was cited as finding that section 133 did not really effectively establish a sophisticated official bilingualism for Canada.  While rights to biligualism in legislative bodies might allow for some members to understand each other if they happened to know the language being used, there was no guarantee for this.  Moreover, courts should interpret these rights conservatively since they are a political matter.  According to ''MacDonald'', having translators in Parliament is thus not mandatory under section 133, since there is no guarantee everyone will be able to understand an MP when he or she chooses to speak in English or French.  These rights are thus [[negative and positive rights|negative rights]] only.  An unconstitutional action would be for Parliament or a legislature to force a person to leave for speaking in English or French.

'''Semantic analytics,''' also termed '''Semantic Relatedness''', is the use of [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]] to analyze content in [[web resource]]s. This field of research combines [[text analytics]] and [[Semantic Web]] technologies like [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]. Semantic analytics measures the relatedness of different ontological concepts.

Some academic research groups that have active project in this area include [http://knoesis.wright.edu Kno.e.sis center] at [[Wright State University]] among others. 

==History==
An important milestone in the beginning of semantic analytics occurred in 1996, although the historical progression of these algorithms is largely subjective. In his seminal study publication, Philip Resnik established that computers have the capacity to emulate human judgement. Spanning the publications of multiple journals, improvements to the accuracy of general semantic analytic computations all claimed to revolutionize the field. However, the lack of a standard terminology throughout the late 90's was the cause of much miscommunication. This prompted Budanitsky &amp; Hirst to standardize the subject in 2006 with a summary that also set a framework for modern spelling and grammar analysis&lt;ref&gt;Budanitsky, Alexander, and Graeme Hirst. “Evaluating WordNet-Based Measures of Lexical Semantic Relatedness.” Comput. Linguist. 32, no. 1 (March 2006): 13–47. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1162/coli.2006.32.1.13&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the early days of semantic analytics, obtaining a large enough reliable knowledge bases was difficult. In 2006, Strube &amp; Ponzetto demonstrated that Wikipedia could be used in semantic analytic calculations&lt;ref&gt;Strube, Michael, and Simone Paolo Ponzetto. “WikiRelate! Computing Semantic Relatedness Using Wikipedia.” In ''Proceedings of the 21st National Conference on Artificial Intelligence - Volume 2'', 1419–1424. AAAI’06. Boston, Massachusetts: AAAI Press, 2006. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1597348.1597414&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. The usage of a large knowledge base like Wikipedia allows for an increase in both the accuracy and applicability of semantic analytics.

==Methods==
Given the subjective nature of the field, different methods used in semantic analytics depend on the domain of application. No singular methods is considered correct, however one of the most generally effective and applicable method is [[Explicit semantic analysis|Explicit Semantic Analysis]] (ESA)&lt;ref&gt;Z. Zhang, A. L. Gentile, and F. Ciravegna, “Recent advances in methods of lexical semantic relatedness – a survey,” Natural Language Engineering, vol. 19, no. 04, pp. 411–479, Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;. ESA was developed by Evgeniy Gabrilovich and Shaul Markovitch in the late 2000's.&lt;ref&gt;Evgeniy Gabrilovich and Shaul Markovitch. 2007. Computing semantic relatedness using Wikipedia-based explicit semantic analysis. In IJcAI, 1606–1611. Retrieved October 9, 2016 from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.aaai.org/Papers/IJCAI/2007/IJCAI07-259.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It uses [[machine learning]] techniques to create a semantic interpreter, which extracts text fragments from articles into a sorted list. The fragments are sorted by how related they are to the surrounding text.

[[Latent semantic analysis]] (LSA) is another common method that does not use ontologies, only considering the text in the input space.

==Applications==

* [[Entity linking]]
* Ontology Building / Knowledge Base Population
* Search &amp; Query Tasks
* Natural Language Processing
** Spoken dialog systems (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana)
* Artificial Intelligence
* Knowledge management

The application of semantic analysis methods generally streamlines organizational processes of any knowledge management system. Academic libraries often use a domain-specific application to create a more efficient organizational system By classifying scientific publications using semantics and Wikipedia, researchers are helping people find resources faster. Search engines like [[Semantic Scholar]] provide organized access to millions of articles.

==Biography==
She was born in 1942.&lt;ref name="AAAS" /&gt; Her parents were William and Mary. Later, her father remarried to a woman, Joan, who currently lives in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Carey's studies focus on the development of children and adults and the cultural construction of concepts over time.

Carey received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Radcliffe College]] in 1964, a [[Fulbright]] scholarship to study in [[University of London]] in 1965, and a [[Ph.D.]]  in [[Experimental psychology]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1971. She was employed at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1972 to 1996 in the Psychology Department of Brain and [[Cognitive development]] and [[New York University]] from 1996 to 2001 before she joined the faculty at [[Harvard University]] in 2001.

On returning to Harvard, Carey began working alongside Elizabeth Spelke, and they started a Developmental Studies lab. Carey also studied alongside George Miller, Jerome Butler, and Roger Brown. She conducted experiments on infants, toddlers, adults, and non-human primates. Carey coined the term "Quinian bootstrapping," a bootstrapping process that historians and philosophers look at on conceptual change.

Carey is a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]], [[National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine]],{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and the [[British Academy]]. Her research analyzes philosophical concepts, and conceptual changes in science over time. She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=AAAS /&gt; Carey is a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and has received many academic awards and distinctions, including the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] for philosophy of mind in 1998. She was the first woman to receive the [[Rumelhart Prize]], in 2009, which has been given annually since 2001 for significant contributions to the theoretical foundation of human [[cognition]].

She is married to the professor of philosophy [[Ned Block]] (NYU). Carey authored ''Conceptual Change in Childhood'', which reconciles [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s work on [[animism]] with later work on children's knowledge of biological concepts. She also authored ''The Origin of Concepts'' for which she won the 2010 Eleanor Maccoby Book Award from the [[American Psychological Association]].

==Career==
When Susan Carey began her career she served on a few Editorial Boards. Some of the boards she was on were for the Psychological Review, Psychological Science, Journal of Acquisition, and Development Psychology. Susan Carey and Elsa Bartlett were at Harvard University when they created the term "[[Fast mapping]]" in 1978.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This term refers to the hypothesized mental process where a new concept is learned only based on a single exposure. Susan Carey wrote a book during her career as a psychologist, which was called Conceptual Change in Childhood. This book was about the cognitive differences between children and adults. It is a case study about children's acquisition of biological knowledge and analyzes the ways the knowledge is restructured during the development. Susan Carey wrote another book called "the Origin of Concepts" which shows the basis of development of cognitive science.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In her professional experience she started out as an assistant professor at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) between 1972 and 1977. She then went to an associate professor at MIT in 1977 to 1984. Instead of being in the psychology department in 1984 she became a professor in the MIT's department of brain and cognitive sciences until 1996. She was a professor at NYU (New York University) for the department of psychology from 1996 to 2001, after her career at NYU she had moved to Harvard and is still currently teaching.

==Awards==
Susan Carey has received many fellowships and honors.

In [[formal language theory]], the '''terminal yield''' (or '''fringe''') of a [[tree data structure|tree]] is the sequence of leaves encountered in an ordered walk of the tree.

Parse trees and/or derivation trees are encountered in the study of [[phrase structure grammar]]s such as [[context-free grammar]]s or [[linear grammar]]s.  The leaves of a derivation tree for a [[formal grammar]] ''G'' are the [[terminal symbol]]s of that grammar, and the internal nodes the [[nonterminal]] or variable symbols.  One can read off the corresponding terminal string by performing an ordered [[tree traversal]] and recording the terminal symbols in the order they are encountered.  The resulting sequence of terminals is a string of the language ''L''(''G'') generated by the grammar ''G''.

'''The King and Country debate''' took place at the [[Oxford Union]] debating society of [[Oxford University]] in [[England]] on 9 February 1933. The motion, "that this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country", was carried by 275 votes to 153.&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite book

==Background==
Prior to the debate, a similar motion had been proposed at the [[Cambridge Union]] by [[Arthur Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede|Arthur Ponsonby]] in March 1927: "That lasting peace can only be secured by the people of England adopting an uncompromising attitude of pacifism".&lt;ref name="sp"&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Parkinson |title=Arena Of Ambition: a history of the Cambridge Union |location=Thriplow |publisher=Icon |year=2009 |isbn=9781848310612 |page=44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was passed by 213 votes to 138 and attracted no public attention.&lt;ref name="sp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ceadel |first=Martin |title=The King and Country Debate, 1933: Student Politics, Pacifism and the Dictators |journal=The Historical Journal |volume=22 |issue=2 |year=1979 |pages=397-422 |doi=10.1017/s0018246x00016885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oxford Union motion was proposed by [[Kenelm Hubert Digby]] of [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] and opposed by K. R. F. Steel-Maitland of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]]. Among other speakers, [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]] argued against it. Digby found some difficulty obtaining a noted speaker to support the motion: [[Norman Angell]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Beverley Nichols]] and [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]] were all unable to attend.&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; Finally, philosopher [[C. E. M. Joad]] agreed to come and support the motion. Joad and David Maurice Graham of Balliol, the Union's Librarian at the time and the original drafter of the motion, argued in favour at the debate.&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt;

The teller for the Ayes was [[Max Beloff]] and that for the Noes was R. G. Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2002|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the Union was Frank Hardie.&lt;ref name= "BWBU"/&gt;

==Debate==
Digby addressed the packed chamber: "It is no mere coincidence that the only country fighting for the cause of peace, Soviet Russia, is the country that has rid itself of the war-mongering clique. The justification urged for the last war was that it was a war to end war. If that were untrue it was a dastardly lie; if it were true, what justification is there for opposition to this motion tonight?"

''[[Isis magazine|Isis]]'', a student magazine of the [[University of Oxford]], reported that Digby had a "tub-thumping style of oratory which would be more appreciated in [[Speaker's Corner|Hyde Park]] than in the Union".

Hogg argued that the policy that Digby advocated would cause, not prevent, war. In his opinion, a powerful England was a factor for peace and a disarmed Britain would have no more influence for peace in Europe than it had in the Far East, with the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]].

Joad delivered what was described as a "tour de force of pacifist rhetoric". He claimed that the motion really meant "that this House will never commit murder on a huge scale whenever the Government decided it should do so" and argued that although limited wars might have been justified in the past, the scale of destruction now possible with modern weapons meant that war had become unthinkable. Joad also postulated that any invasion of Britain could be defeated by a [[Gandhian]] campaign of [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt;

All told, there were five opening speakers, nine others supporting the motion and ten against. Future Oxford Union President [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]] was the eighth of the nine speakers in support of the motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the motion was put, President Frank Hardie declared it carried, 275 votes to 153. Digby went to shake hands with Hogg, but his opponent refused to do so.&lt;ref name= "BWBU"&gt;{{cite book|title=Barbed Wire Between Us: A Story of Love and War|first1=Derek |last1=Round |first2=Kenelm |last2=Digby|publisher=Random House |location=Auckland|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
A Fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], [[R. B. McCallum]], claimed that the "sensation created when this resolution was passed was tremendous. It received world-wide publicity.... Throughout England people, especially elderly people, were thoroughly shocked. Englishmen who were in India at the time have told me of the dismay they felt when they heard of it.... 'What is wrong with the younger generation?' was the general query".&lt;ref name= "McCallum pp. 177–80"&gt;{{harvnb|McCallum|1944|pp=177–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the debate gained little media attention, but the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' ran an article about the debate headlined "DISLOYALTY AT OXFORD: GESTURE TOWARDS THE REDS".&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; The ''[[Daily Express]]'' wrote: "There is no question but that the woozy-minded Communists, the practical jokers, and the sexual indeterminates of Oxford have scored a great success in the publicity that has followed this victory.... Even the plea of immaturity, or the irresistible passion of the undergraduate for posing, cannot excuse such a contemptible and indecent action as the passing of that resolution".

The ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' responded differently: "The obvious meaning of this resolution [is] youth's deep disgust with the way in which past wars for 'King and Country' have been made, and in which, they suspect, future wars may be made; disgust at the national hypocrisy which can fling over the timidities and follies of politicians, over base greeds and communal jealousies and jobbery, the cloak of an emotional symbol they did not deserve".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2002|pp=374–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the controversy arose because some newspapers falsely claimed that the supporters of the motion had insulted King [[George V]] (in fact, the British monarchy had been barely mentioned in the debate) or the British soldiers, killed in World War I&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Oxford Magazine |date=9 March 1933 |pages=538–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Daily Express'' reporter claimed to have found the Mayor of Oxford, Alderman C. H. Brown, and his wife sitting in front of the fire reading their bibles, with Brown claiming, "I say that as mayor of a city that fathers a university of such foreign communistic sentiments, I am ashamed". [[Cambridge University]] was reported to have threatened to pull out of that year's [[Boat Race]] because of "incompatibility of temperament".&lt;ref name= "BWBU"/&gt;

An anonymous critic sent the Oxford Union a box containing 275 [[white feather]]s, one for each vote for the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1997|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second box followed, and Hardie announced that each member who had voted 'aye' could have two feathers.&lt;ref name= "BWBU"/&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]] condemned the motion in a speech on 17 February 1933 to the Anti-Socialist and Anti-Communist Union: "That abject, squalid, shameless avowal... It is a very disquieting and disgusting symptom":

&lt;blockquote&gt;My mind turns across the narrow waters of Channel and the North Sea, where great nations stand determined to defend their national glories or national existence with their lives. I think of Germany, with its splendid clear-eyed youths marching forward on all the roads of the Reich singing their ancient songs, demanding to be conscripted into an army; eagerly seeking the most terrible weapons of war; burning to suffer and die for their fatherland. I think of Italy, with her ardent Fascisti, her renowned Chief, and stern sense of national duty. I think of France, anxious, peace-loving, pacifist to the core, but armed to the teeth and determined to survive as a great nation in the world. One can almost feel the curl of contempt upon the lips of the manhood of all these people when they read this message sent out by Oxford University in the name of young England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Gilbert |title=Prophet of Truth. Winston S. Churchill. 1922-1939 |publisher=Minerva |year=1990 |page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By contrast, Joad, [[A. A. Milne]] and [[Francis Wrigley Hirst]] all publicly defended the resolution. Hirst later argued in his book, ''Consequences of the War to Great Britain'' (1934), that the resolution did not rule out wars of self-defence, only [[imperialist]] conflicts.&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; [[John Alfred Spender]] and [[James Louis Garvin]] took issue with the resolution, which, in their view, neglected the issue of war prevention.&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt;

In March 1933 the "Oxford Pledge" or "[[Oxford Oath]]", as the resolution came to be called, was adopted by the [[University of Manchester]] and the [[University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1997|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the dominions of the [[British Empire]], the [[University of Melbourne]], the [[University of Toronto]] and the [[University of Cape Town]] all passed motions affirming that they would fight for King and Country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. P. |last=Thornton |title=The Imperial Idea and Its Enemies |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |year=1966 |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks after it was passed, [[Randolph Churchill]] proposed a resolution at the Oxford Union to delete the "King and Country" motion from the Union's records but was defeated by 750 votes to 138, in a rowdy debate, where Churchill was met by a barrage of hisses and stink bombs. A bodyguard of Oxford Conservatives and police escorted Churchill back to his hotel, after the debate.&lt;ref name= "BWBU"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2002|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Kimber, 3rd Baronet|Charles Kimber]], who would later lead the peace group [[Federal Union]], was present at the debate, and later argued the vote was a protest against nationalist wars, not war in general. Kimber noted that several of the motion's supporters later fought with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lyn |last=Smith |title=Voices against War : A Century of Protest |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |year=2009 |pages=79-94 |ISBN=184596456X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking after the debate, Digby said: "I believe that the motion was representative neither of the majority of the undergraduates of Oxford nor of the youth of this country. I am certain if war broke out tomorrow the students of the university would flock to the recruiting office as their fathers and uncles did."&lt;ref name= "BWBU"/&gt; He was proved right: when World War II broke out in September 1939, the [[War Office]] organised a recruiting board at Oxford, which invited undergraduates and resident postgraduates under 25 to enlist: 2,632, out of a potential 3,000, volunteered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Addison |chapter=Oxford and the Second World War |editor1-first=Brian |editor1-last=Harrison |title=The History of the University of Oxford: The Twentieth-century |volume=Volume 8 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1994 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCallum recalled at the outbreak of war two students, "men of light and leading in their college and with a good academic record" visited him to say goodbye before leaving to join their units. Both of them had separately said that if they had to vote on the "King and Country" resolution then and there, they would do so. One of them said: "I am not going to fight for King and Country, and you will notice that no one, not [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]], not [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Halifax]], has asked us to".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCallum|1944|pp=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Telford Taylor]], chief United States prosecutor at the [[Nuremberg trials]], wrote "the 'King and Country' debate was a colorful reflection of the British temper between the two great wars. Exhausted and disgusted by the prolonged bloodbath in [[Flanders Fields]], wracked by internal economic strains and already tiring of the burdens of empire, neither the people nor their leaders were in any mood to embark on new crusades".&lt;ref name= "BWBU"/&gt;

Sixty years after the event, Digby mused, "It was just a debate. I don't know what all the fuss was about. Frank Hardie had asked me to propose the motion and I agreed. That's all there was to it. But ever since the debate security intelligence organisations seem to have taken an interest in me". Certainly Digby's subsequent career in [[Sarawak]] and the United Kingdom suffered by his association with the debate.&lt;ref name= "BWBU"/&gt;

==Foreign reaction==
In a speech in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 20 July 1934, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP [[Robert Bernays]] described a visit he made to Germany:

{{quotation|I remember very vividly, a few months after the famous pacifist resolution at the Oxford Union visiting Germany and having a talk with a prominent leader of the young Nazis. He was asking about this pacifist motion and I tried to explain it to him. There was an ugly gleam in his eye when he said, "The fact is that you English are soft". Then I realized that the world enemies of peace might be the pacifists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone |first=Quintin |last=Hogg |title=[[The Left was Never Right]] |publisher=Faber and Faber |year=1945 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 18-year-old [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]], who was walking across Europe in 1934, "dreaded" being asked in Germany about the resolution, and tried to explain it: "A kind of joke, really...I could detect a kindling glint of scornful pity and triumph in the surrounding eyes which declared quite plainly their certainty that, were I right, England was too far gone in degeneracy and frivolity to present a problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Patrick Leigh Fermor |first=Patrick Leigh |last=Fermor |title=[[A Time of Gifts]] |publisher=John Murray |year=1977 |pages=115-116}}, where the debate is erroneously dated to 'the summer before'!&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benito Mussolini]] was particularly struck by the sentiment expressed by the undergraduates and became convinced that the Joad declaration proved that Britain was a "frightened, flabby old woman".&lt;ref name= "Churchill p. 150"&gt;{{harvnb|Churchill|1986|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; While considering whether to take British threats seriously while embarking on his [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Abyssinia adventure]] Mussolini often referred to the Joad declaration on why he ignored British demands.&lt;ref name= "Churchill p. 150"/&gt;

Martin Ceadel, reviewing the German coverage of the "King and Country Debate", notes that although it was widely covered in Germany, the Nazis did not seem to have made political capital out of it: "indeed, the London correspondent of the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' was in 1933 stressing rather the militarism of British youth".&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; Shortly before the outbreak of war in 1939, the ''Völkischer Beobachter'' was still "insisting that the Oxford debate was insignificant".&lt;ref name="mc"/&gt;

Churchill would, after the war, write on how Japan and Germany too took note of the Joad resolution, which altered their way of thinking about Britain as a "decadent, degenerate... and swayed many [of their] calculations".&lt;ref name= "Churchill p. 77"&gt;{{harvnb|Churchill|1986|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tulu''' (Tulu:  {{lang|tcy-Knda|ತುಳು&amp;nbsp;ಭಾಷೆ}} {{lang|tcy-Latn|Tulu bāse}} {{IPA-xx|ˈt̪ulu ˈbɒːsæ|}})&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--This is a footnote--&gt;
Tulu can be written in three different scripts: ''Tulu bāse'' is written [[File:Tulubaase4.png|alt=&lt;File: Tuḷu bāse&gt;|75x75px]] in [[Tulu script]], {{lang-kn|ತುಳು ಬಾಸೆ}} in [[Kannada script]] . {{lang|tcy|ಭಾಷೆ}} ''bhāṣe'', {{lang|tcy|ಭಾಶೆ}}, ''bhāśe'', and {{lang|tcy|ಬಾಶೆ}} ''bāśe'' are alternative spellings for the Tulu word ''bāse'' in the Kannada script. The correct spelling for the word "language" in [[Kannada language|Kannada]] is {{lang-kn|ಭಾಷೆ}} ''bhāṣe'', but that is not necessarily true in Tulu. Männer’s ''Tulu-English and English-Tulu Dictionary'' (1886) says, "{{lang|tcy|ಬಾಶೆ, ಬಾಸೆ}} '''bāšè''', '''bāsè''', ''see'' {{lang|tcy|ಭಾಷೆ}}." (vol.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;478), "{{lang|tcy|ಭಾಶೆ, ಭಾಷೆ}} '''bhāšè''', '''bhāshè''', ''s''.&amp;nbsp;Speech, language." (vol.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;508), meaning that the four spellings are more or less acceptable. The word is actually pronounced {{lang|tcy|ಬಾಸೆ}} ''bāse'' in Tulu. Note that '''š''' and '''sh''' in his dictionary correspond to ''ś'' and ''ṣ'', respectively, in [[ISO 15919]].

[[Robert Caldwell]], in his pioneering work ''A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages'', called this language "peculiar and very interesting". According to him, "Tulu is one of the most highly developed languages of the Dravidian family. It looks as if it had been cultivated for its own sake."&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell (1856), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|postscript=.|last=Raghuram|first=M.|title=Tulu Fit To Be Included in Eighth Schedule|url=http://www.hindu.com/2002/07/16/stories/2002071602460300.htm|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|publisher=[[The Hindu Group]]|date=16 July 2002|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tulu is the primary spoken language in Tulu Nadu, a region comprising the districts of [[Dakshina Kannada]] and [[Udupi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dk.nic.in/|title=ದಕ್ಷಿಣ ಕನ್ನಡ ಜಿಲ್ಲೆ, ಮಂಗಳೂರು, ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ|website=Dk.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the west of the state of [[Karnataka]] and the [[Kasaragod taluk]].

The various medieval inscriptions of Tulu from the 15th century are in the [[Tigalari alphabet|Tigalari or Tulu]] script.&lt;ref name="BhatSteveer" /&gt; Two Tulu epics named ''Sri Bhagavato'' and ''Kaveri'' from the 17th century were also written in the same script.&lt;ref name="BhatSteveer" /&gt; However, in modern times the Tulu language is mostly written using the [[Kannada script]].&lt;ref name="BhatSteveer" /&gt; The Tulu language is known for its [[oral literature]] in the form of epic poems called ''Paddana'' .The [[Epic of Siri]] and the legend of [[Koti and Chennayya]] belong to this category of Tulu literature.&lt;ref name="BhatSteveer" /&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main|Dravidian languages}}
Tulu belongs to the southern branch of the family of [[Dravidian languages]]. It descends directly from Proto-Southern Dravidian, which in turn descends directly from [[Proto-Dravidian]], the hypothesised mother language from which all Dravidian languages descend. The Tulu language originates in the southern part of India.

==Etymology==
Linguists [[:kn:ಪುರುಷೋತ್ತಮ ಬಿಳಿಮಲೆ|Purushottama Bilimale (ಪುರುಷೋತ್ತಮ ಬಿಳಿಮಲೆ)]] have suggested that the word "Tulu" means "that which is connected with water", based on words from Kannada and Tamil. "Tulave" (jack fruit) means "watery" in Tulu; and, other water-related words in Tulu include "talipu", "teli", "teLi", "teLpu", "tuLipu", "tulavu", and "tamel". In Kannada, there are words such as tuLuku means "that which has characteristics of water" and toLe{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In Tamil, thuli means drop of water;{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and, thulli means the same in Malayalam.

== Official status ==
Tulu is not currently an official language of India or any other country. Efforts are being made to include Tulu to the 8th Schedule of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Centre still examining inclusion of Tulu, Kodava in 8th Schedule|url=http://www.coastaldigest.com/news/101637-centre-still-examining-inclusion-of-tulu-kodava-in-8th-schedule|work=Coastaldigest.com - The Trusted News Portal of India, Coastal Karnataka|date=22 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, an online campaign was organized to include Tulu to 8th schedule of constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/twitter-campaign-to-include-tulu-in-eighth-schedule-of-constitution/article19459992.ece|title=Twitter campaign to include Tulu in Eighth Schedule of Constitution|date=2017-08-10|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-11-12|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2017, when the prime minister, [[Narendra Modi]] visited [[Dharmasthala Temple]] same demand was presented in front of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/demand-to-include-tulu-in-eight-schedule-grows-louder-with-pms-visit/articleshow/61327370.cms|title=Demand to include Tulu in Eight Schedule grows louder with PM’s visit - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oldest available inscriptions in Tulu are from the period between 14th to 15th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CF5Qo4NDE64C&amp;pg=PA162 |title=The Dravidian languages - Sanford B.

Another group of inscriptions are found in the ''Ullur'' ''Subrahmanya'' Temple near [[Kundapura]]. Many linguists like S.U. Panniyadi and [[L. V. Ramaswami Iyer]] as well as P.S. Subrahmanya suggested that Tulu is among the oldest languages in the Dravidian family which branched independently from its Proto-Dravidian roots nearly 500 years ago. This assertion is based on the fact that Tulu still preserves many aspects of the [[Proto-Dravidian language]].

This dating of Tulu is also based on the fact that the region where Tulu is natively spoken was known to the ancient Tamils as Tulu Nadu. Also, the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet Mamular who belongs to the Sangam Age (200 AD) describes Tulu Nadu and its dancing beauties in one of his poems.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2002/07/16/stories/2002071602460300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Tulu fit to be included in Eighth Schedule | date=2002-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Halmidi inscriptions one finds mention of the Tulu country as the kingdom of the [[Alupas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-01-25/mangalore/28038826_1_tulu-language-karnataka-tulu-sahitya-academy-tulu-nadu | work=The Times Of India | title=Teaching Tulu at primary level sought | date=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region was also known to the Greeks of the 2nd century as ''Tolokoyra''. The history of Tulu would not be complete without the mention of the [[Charition mime]], a [[Greek language|Greek]] play belonging to 2nd century BC. The play's plot centres around the coastal Karnataka, where Tulu is mainly spoken. The play is mostly in Greek, but the [[India]]n characters in the play are seen speaking a language different from Greek.

There is considerable ambiguity regarding the Indian language in the play, though all scholars agree the Indian language is Dravidian, but there is considerable dispute over which one. Noted German Indologist Dr. E. Hultzsch was the first to suggest that the language was Dravidian.{{clarify|date=June 2015}} The dispute regarding the language in the play is yet to be settled, but scholars agree that the dispute arises from the fact that Old Kannada, Old Tamil and Tulu during the time when the play was written were perhaps dialectical variations of the same [[wiktionary:proto-language|proto-language]], and that over the years they evolved into their present forms as separate languages.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Tulu is widely considered one of the most rich and well organized for many reasons. Found largely in Karnataka, it is spoken primarily within the Indian state. Dating back several hundred years, the language has developed numerous defining qualities. The Tulu people follow a saying which promotes leaving negative situations and finding newer, more positive ones. The language, however, is not as popular as others which means it could become endangered and extinct very soon. The influence of other mainstream languages is present danger for the Tulu people. With the right degree of awareness, we can help promote Tulu to more people who may appreciate it and its uniqueness.[https://archive.org/stream/elementsofcompar00lathrich/elementsofcompar00lathrich_djvu.txt &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] Today, it is spoken by nearly 1.8 million people around the globe. Large parts of the language are altered and changed constantly because it is commonly passed down through oral tradition. Oral traditions within Tulu have meant that certain phrases have not always maintained the same meaning or importance.

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Alvakheda map.jpg|thumb|Map Showing ancient Tulu kingdom of Alva Kheda]]
According to [[Malayalam]] works like [[Keralolpathi]] and [[Sangam literature]] in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the region stretching from the [[Chandragiri river]], now part of the [[Kasaragod district]], Kerala, to [[Gokarna, India|Gokarna]], now part of [[Uttara Kannada]] district of Karnataka, was ruled by the [[Alupas]] and was known as '''Alva Kheda'''. This Kingdom was the Homeland of Tulu speaking people. 
However the present day Tulu linguistic majority area is confined to the region of [[Tulu Nadu]], which comprises the districts of part of [[Dakshina Kannada]] and [[Udupi]] in the Indian state of [[Karnataka]] and the northern part of [[Kasaragod district]] of Kerala up to the river Payaswani also known as Chandragiri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/13/stories/2006081317290300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Tulu Nadu Movement Gaining Momentum | date=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of [[Mangalore]], [[Udupi]] and [[Kasaragod Town|Kasaragod]] being the cultural centres of Tulu culture.

[[Tuluva]]s have a saying: "Oorudu nanji aanda paardh badkodu" . A loose translation would be: "If it's tough at home; run away and survive". Tuluvas are true to this character and have migrated to other places in great numbers. Early migration was to neighbouring regions like Malabar (now Kerala), Mysore kingdom, Madras Presidency ( Tamil Nadu now - areas like salem, attur, chinnasalem, thiruvannamalai, villupuram, vellore, chennai and perambalur). The large scale migration of Tulu speaking people from undivided [[dakshina Kannada]] district to other provinces (regions) of India happened during World War I, but there is no concrete materialistic evidence to prove.

The reason being rationing of food grains by British who were ruling India then and spread of communicable diseases. The next wave of emigration was during World War II, now they settled in interior parts of Karnataka, coastal [[Andhra Pradesh]] and also far off cities like Mumbai and Chennai. They mostly ran restaurants serving [[Udupi cuisine]]. [[Mumbai]] and [[Thane]] in Maharashtra state has a sizable population of [[Tuluva]]s. Even today Tulu is widely spoken in the Dakshina Kannada, partially in [[Udupi district]] of Karnataka state and to some extent in Kasaragod of Kerala. Efforts are also being made to include Tulu in the list of [[Languages of India|Official languages of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yakshagana.com/tulu-recog.htm |title=Why Tulu Language Deserves Recognition from Kendra Sahithya Academy and Why It Should Be Included in Schedule 8B of the Constitution |publisher=Yakshagana.com |date=2000-08-12 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, Tulu is largely contained to the southern part of India. The Indian state of Karnataka is where the language seems to thrive in the present day. Some of the major cities within the Tulu culture include Kasaragod and Mangalore. [http://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=138784 &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] Speakers of the language have reflected interest in spreading to more modern nations such as the United States.

==Writing system==
[[File:Tulubaase4.png|thumb|right|215px|alt=tigalari script.|Tigalari Script.]]
{{Main|Tigalari alphabet|Kannada alphabet|}}

The various historical inscriptions of Tulu found around Barkur and Kundapura are in the Tigalari script. The [[Kannada script]] has become contemporary script for the Tulu language gradually. All contemporary works and literature are done in the Kannada script. Historically, Brahmins of [[Tulu Nadu]] and [[Havyaka Brahmin]]s used the [[Tigalari alphabet|Tigalari]] script to write [[Vedas]] and other [[Sanskrit]] works. The Tigalari script is descended from the [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] through the [[Grantha alphabet|Grantha]] script. It is a sister script of the [[Malayalam script]]. However, very few works written in vernacular languages like Kannada and Tulu are available. Hence, the Tigalari script was employed by Tulu Brahmins to write Tulu and Kannada languages apart from the Kannada script. The National Mission for Manuscripts has conducted several workshops on this script with the help of a scholar, Keladi Gunda Jois. In the 18th century, the use of the Kannada script for writing Tulu and non-availability of print in the Tigalari script contributed to the marginalization of the Tigalari script. Currently, the script is studied by few scholars and manuscriptologists for research and religious purposes. Although its contents is largely derived from the Kannada language, there is proof that Tulu may have been before others in the Dravidian family. The [[Kannada script]] has become the contemporary script for the Tulu language gradually. All contemporary works and literature are done in the Kannada script.

==Dialects==
Tulu language has four dialects, which are broadly similar, with slight variations.

The four dialects are:
#'''Common Tulu''':&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=tcy |title=Ethnologue report for language code: tcy |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spoken by the majority includes the [[Mogaveera]], [[Bunt (community)|Bunts]], [[Billava]], [[Kulala]] [[Devadiga]], [[Jogi]] communities and others. This is the dialect of commerce, trade and entertainment and is mainly used for inter-community communication. It is further subdivided into seven groups:
##Central Tulu: Spoken in [[Mangalore]].
##Northwest Tulu: Spoken in [[Udupi]].
##Northeast Tulu: Spoken in [[Karkala]] and [[Belthangady]].
##Southwest Tulu: Spoken in [[Manjeshwar]] and [[Kasaragod district|Kasaragod]], known as Kasaragod Tulu influencing [[Malayalam]].
##Southcentral Tulu: Spoken in [[Bantwal]],.
##Southeast Tulu: Spoken in [[Puttur, Karnataka|Puttur]] [[Sullia]].
##Southern Tulu: Spoken in South of [[Kasaragod]] and [[Payaswini]] (Chandragiri) river influencing [[Malayalam]] known as Thenkaayi Tulu.
#'''Brahmin Tulu''':&lt;ref name="ethnologue"/&gt; Spoken by the Tulu Brahmins who are subdivided into [[Shivalli Brahmins]], [[Sthanika Brahmins]] and [[Tuluva Hebbars]]. It is slightly influenced by [[Sanskrit]].
#'''Jain Dialect''':&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/places/0020a.htm |title=Places |publisher=Boloji.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spoken by the [[Tulu Jains]]. It is a dialect where the initial letters 'T' and 'S' have been replaced by the letter 'H'. For example, the word ''Tare'' is pronounced as ''Hare'', ''Saadi'' is pronounced as ''Haadi''.
#'''Girijan Dialect''':&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; Spoken by the Koraga, Mansa, other Girijans and Tribal classes.
#There are numerous variations and dialects of the Tulu language. There's no official script for the language which allows for substantial room in variation and personalizing. Malayalam was the script that was used to help write the Tulu language. However, recent studies show that this script may have been designed based off an original Tulu script that's yet to be found. Of the five Dravidian languages, Tulu is considered one of the oldest as more pieces from its history are being discovered. The different dialects can be based off the location within northern and southern parts of Karnataka.

==Spoken characteristics==

===Phonology===
Five short and five long vowels (''a'', ''ā'', ''e'', ''ē'', ''u'', ''ū'', ''i'', ''ī'', ''o'', ''ō'') are common in [[Dravidian languages]]. Like [[Kodava Takk]] (and also like [[Konkani language|Konkani]] and [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]), Tulu also has an {{IPA|[ɛ]}}- or {{IPA|[æ]}}-like vowel, generally occurring word-finally. [[Kannada script]] does not have a symbol to specifically represent this vowel, which is often written as a normal ''e''.&lt;ref name="s163"&gt;Bhat (1998), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the first person singular form and the third person singular masculine form of a verb are spelled identically in all tenses, both. ending in ''e'', but are pronounced differently: the terminating ''e'' in the former sounds nearly like ‘a’ in the English word ‘man’ ({{lang|tcy|ಮಲ್ಪುವೆ}} ''maḷpuve'' {{IPA|/maɭpuvæ/}}, "I make"), while that in the latter like ‘e’ in ‘men’ ({{lang|tcy|ಮಲ್ಪುವೆ}} ''maḷpuve'' {{IPA|/maɭpuve/}}, "he makes").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brigel|first=J.|title=A Grammar of the Tulu Language|year=1872|publisher=C. Stolz|url=https://archive.org/details/grammaroftululan00briguoft|accessdate=2009-10-31|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paniyadi in his 1932 grammar used a special vowel sign to denote Tulu /ɛ/ in the Kannada script: according to Bhat, he used two ''telakaṭṭu''s for this purpose (usually, a ''telakaṭṭu'' means the crest that a Kannada character like {{lang|kn|ಕ, ತ, ನ}} has), and the same convention was adopted by Upadhyaya in his 1988 Tulu Lexicon.&lt;ref name="s163"/&gt; The long counterpart of this vowel occurs in some words.&lt;ref name="s161"&gt;Bhat (1998), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; In all dialects, the pair /e/ and /ɛ/ contrasts.&lt;ref name="s161"/&gt;

Additionally, like [[Kodava Takk]] and [[Toda language|Toda]], and like [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] ''saṁvr̥tōkāram'', Tulu has an {{IPA|[ɯ]}}-like vowel (or [[schwa]] {{IPA|/ə/}}) as a [[phoneme]], which is [[Romanization|romanized]] as ''ŭ'' (ISO), ''ɯ'', or ''u̥''. Both J. Brigel and A. Männer say that it is pronounced like ''e'' in the French ''je''. Bhat describes this phoneme as /ɯ/. However, if it is like Malayalam "half-u", {{IPA|[ə]}} or {{IPA|[ɨ]}} may be a better description. In the Kannada script, Brigel and Männer used a [[virama]] (halant), {{lang|kn|&amp;nbsp;್}}, to denote this vowel. Bhat says a ''telakaṭṭu'' is used for this purpose, but apparently he too means a virama.&lt;ref&gt;Bhat (1998), pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast between {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/ɭ/}} is preserved in the South Common dialect and in the Brahmin dialect, but is lost in several dialects.&lt;ref name="s161"/&gt; Additionally, the Brahmin dialect has {{IPA|/ʂ/}} and {{IPA|/ɦ/}}. Aspirated consonants are sometimes used in the Brahmin dialect, but are not phonemic.&lt;ref name="s161"/&gt; In the [[Koraga language|Koraga]] and [[Holeya]] dialects, ''s'' {{IPA|/s/}} and ''ś'' {{IPA|/ʃ/}} merge with ''c'' {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} (the Koraga dialect of the Tulu language is different from the Koraga language).&lt;ref name="s161"/&gt; Word-initial consonant clusters are rare and occur mainly in Sanskrit loanwords.&lt;ref name="s161"/&gt; As noted in 'Dialects/Varieties', the Tulu alphabet resembles the Malayalam script in many ways. It is also similar to many characters found in the Tigalari alphabet. This is from the same region in the state of Karnataka. The Tigilari and Kannada alhpabets include a stress on vowels with "a" and "o"sounds. [http://www.omniglot.com/writing/tulu.htm &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] Other vowels include sounds such as "au" "am" and "ah". Numerous consonants have their own origin from the Dravidian languages like "kha" "gha" "dha" and "jha". These are derived from the Tigalari alphabet.

===Morphology===
Tulu has five [[Lexical category|parts of speech]]: [[noun]]s (substantives and [[adjective]]s), [[pronoun]]s, numerals, [[verb]]s, and [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brigel (1872), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantives have three [[grammatical gender]]s (masculine, feminine, and neuter), two [[grammatical number|numbers]] (singular and plural), and eight [[grammatical case|cases]] (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, ablative or instrumental, communicative, and vocative). According to Bhat, Tulu has two distinct locative cases. The communicative case is used with verbs like "tell", "speak", "ask", "beseech", "inquire", and denotes ''at whom'' a message, an inquiry, or a request is aimed, as in "I told ''him''." or "I speak ''to them''." It is also used to denote ''relationship with whom'' it is about, in a context like "I am on good terms ''with him''." or "I have nothing ''against him''."&lt;ref&gt;Brigel (1872), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Bhat calls it the [[sociative case]]. It is somewhat similar to the [[comitative case]], but different in that it denotes communication or relationship, not physical companionship. The plural suffix is ''-rŭ'', ''-ḷu'', ''-kuḷu'', or ''-āḍḷu''; as, ''mēji'' ("table"), ''mējiḷu'' ("tables").&lt;ref&gt;Brigel (1872), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The nominative case is unmarked, while the remaining cases are expressed by different suffixes.

The following table shows the declension of a noun, based on Brigel and Bhat ('''u̥''' used by Brigel and '''ɯ''' used by Bhat are both shown as '''ŭ''' for clarity): when two forms are given, the one in parentheses is by Bhat, and the other is by Brigel.&lt;ref&gt;Brigel (1872), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhat (1998), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these differences may be dialectal variations.

The personal pronouns are irregularly inflected: ''yānŭ'' "I" becomes ''yen-'' in [[oblique case]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brigel (1872), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Tulu makes the distinction between the [[Clusivity|inclusive]] and exclusive "we" (See [[Clusivity#Dravidian languages|''Clusivity: Dravidian languages'']]): ''nama'' "we (including you)" as opposed to ''yenkuḷu'' "we (not including you)".&lt;ref name="Brigel33"&gt;Brigel (1872), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; For verbs, this distinction does not exist. The personal pronouns of the second person are ''ī'' (oblique: ''nin-'') "you (singular)" and ''nikuḷu'' "you (plural)". Three genders are distinguished in the third person, as well as proximate and remote forms. For example, ''imbe'' "he (proximate)", ''āye'' "he (remote)". The suffix ''-rŭ'' makes a polite form of personal pronouns, as in ''īrŭ'' "you (respectfully)", ''ārŭ'' "he (remote; respectfully)".&lt;ref name="Brigel33"/&gt;
[[Preposition and postposition|Postpositions]] are used usually with a noun in the genitive case, as in ''guḍḍe-da mittŭ'' "on the hill".

Tulu verbs have three forms: [[Voice (grammar)|active]], [[causative]], and [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]] (or middle voice).&lt;ref&gt;Brigel (1872), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
They [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for [[Grammatical person|person]], number, gender, [[Grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, [[pluperfect]], future, and [[future perfect]]), [[Mood (grammar)|mood]] (indicative, imperative, conditional, infinitive, potential, and subjunctive), and [[Grammatical polarity|polarity]] (positive and negative).&lt;ref&gt;Brigel (1872), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syntax ==
Each sentence is composed of a subject and a predicate and every sentence is a full speech or thought in words. There is both singular and plural while being expressed in first through third person. There are several exceptions to each of these depending on the instance. For example: the verb has to be in a plural style if there are numerous nominatives within a sentence or of different genders that agree with the previous sentence. The verb may also be omitted in some sentences. Present tense and past tense may change and their perception.[https://archive.org/details/grammaroftululan00briguoft]

==Written literature==
The written literature of Tulu is not as large as the literature of other literary Dravidian languages such as Tamil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/05/21/stories/2009052150550200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=‘Tulu is a Highly Developed Language of the Dravidian Family' | date=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Tulu is one of only five literary Dravidian languages, the other four being [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]]. The earliest available Tulu literature that survives to this date is the Tulu translation of the great [[Sanskrit]] epic of [[Mahabharata]] called '''Mahabharato''' (ಮಹಾಭಾರತೊ). It was written by ''Arunabja'' (1657 AD), a poet who lived in [[Kodavur]] near [[Udupi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/11/13/stories/2004111302140500.htm | location=Chennai, India | newspaper=[[The Hindu]] | title=Tulu Academy Yet to Realise Its Goal | date=2004-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; around late 14th to early 15th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111126113813/http://www.kannadauniversity.org/EN/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other important literary works in Tulu are:
* [[Devi Mahatmyam]]'s (ಶ್ರೀ ದೇವಿ ಮಹಾತ್ಮೆ) 1200 AD - Tulu translation
* Sri Bhagavata (ಶ್ರೀ ಭಾಗವತೊ) 1626 AD - written by Vishnu Tunga
* Kaveri (1391 AD)

This script was mainly used to write religious and literary works in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Statement-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b35"&gt;Burnell (1874), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even today the official script of the eight Tulu monasteries ([[Ashta Mathas of Udupi]]) founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in Udupi is Tulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=K T Vinobha|title=Pejawar pontiff signs mutt papers in Tulu|url=http://lite.epaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&amp;pageid=6&amp;edlabel=TOIBG&amp;mydateHid=11-10-2011&amp;pubname=&amp;edname=&amp;articleid=Ar00602&amp;format=&amp;publabel=TOI|accessdate=22 November 2011|newspaper=Times of India|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113104557/http://lite.epaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&amp;pageid=6&amp;edlabel=TOIBG&amp;mydateHid=11-10-2011&amp;pubname=&amp;edname=&amp;articleid=Ar00602&amp;format=&amp;publabel=TOI|archive-date=13 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thecanaratimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecanaratimes.com/epaper/index.php/archives/12807 |title=Pejawar Seer's Signature Is in Tulu Script |publisher=The Canara Times |date=2011-10-12 |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pontiffs of the monasteries write their names using this script when they are appointed.&lt;ref name="thecanaratimes.com"/&gt;

Modern-day Tulu literature is written using the Kannada script. ''Mandara Ramayana'' is the most notable piece of modern Tulu literature. Written by Mandara Keshava Bhatt, it received the Sahitya Academy award for best poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahitya-akademi.gov.in/old_version/awa4.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223183029/http://www.sahitya-akademi.gov.in/old_version/awa4.htm|date=23 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Madipu'', ''Mogaveera'', ''Saphala'' and ''Samparka'' are popular Tulu periodicals published from Mangalore. The Tulu Sahitya Academy, established by the state government of Karnataka in 1994, as also the Kerala Tulu Academy established by the Indian State Government of Kerala in [[Manjeshwaram]] in 2007, are important governmental organisations that promote Tulu literature. Nevertheless, there are numerous organisations spread all over the world with significant Tulu-migrated populations that contribute to Tulu literature. Some notable contributors of Tulu literature are [[Kayyar Kinhanna Rai]], [[M. K. Seetharam Kulal]], Amruta Someshwara, B. A. Viveka Rai, Kedambadi Jattappa Rai, Venkataraja Puninchattaya, Paltadi Ramakrishna Achar, Dr. Sunitha M. Shetty, Dr. Vamana Nandavara, Sri. Balakrishna Shetty Polali.

==Oral traditions==
The oral traditions of Tulu are one of the major traditions that greatly show the finer aspects of the language. The following are various forms of Tulu oral tradition and literature.

*[[Paddanas]]: A form of oral [[epic poem]] sung in a highly stylised manner during the [[Hindu]] rituals of [[Bhuta Kola]] and [[Nagaradhane]], which are peculiar to the Tulu people. These Paddanas are mostly legends about gods or historical personalities among the people. The longest of them being '''[[Epic of Siri|Siri Paddana]]''', which is about a woman called Siri who shows strength and integrity during adverse times and in turn attains divinity. The Paddana greatly depicts the independent nature of the Tulu womenfolk. The entire Paddana was written down by [[Finnish people|Finnish]] scholar [[Lauri Honko]]&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"/&gt; of the [[University of Turku]] and it falls four lines short of [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]].
*Riddles: They are another important aspect of Tulu oral traditions. These riddles are largely tongue twisting and mostly deal with kinship and agriculture.
*[[Bhajan]]s: Bhajans sung in numerous temples across the Tulu region are varied and are dedicated to various gods and goddesses. Most of these are of the Hindu tradition, others being [[Jain]]. They are sung in both the [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] style as well a style similar to what is used in [[Yakshagana]].
*Kabitol: Songs sung during the cultivation of crops, the traditional occupation of the people. '''O Bele''' is considered the finest among them.

==Theatre==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Uloopi Mantapa.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A female character in [[Yakshagana]]]] --&gt;
Theatre in the form of the traditional [[Yakshagana]], prevalent in coastal Karnataka and northern Kerala has greatly preserved the finer aspects of the Tulu language. Yakshagana which is conducted in Tulu is very popular among the Tuluva people. It can also be seen as a form of temple art, as there are many Yakshagana groups that are attached to temples, for example that of [[Kateel|Kateel Durga Parameshwari Temple]] as also the [[Udupi Krishna Temple]].

Presently, eight professional Yakshagana troupes perform Tulu-language Yakshagana{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} not only during the Yakshagana season but also during the off-season in various places in Karnataka and outside.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In [[Mumbai]], Tulu Yakshagana is very popular among the Tulu audiences. More than 2,000 Yakshagana artistes take part in the performance in various places in Mumbai annually.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Notable performers include Kalladi Koraga Shetty, Pundur Venkatraja Puninchathaya, Guru Bannanje Sanjiva Suvarna and Pathala Venkatramana Bhat.

Tulu plays are among the major entertainment for admirers of art and culture in the [[Tulu Nadu]]. Tulu plays, generally centered on the comic genre, are very popular in Mumbai and [[Bangalore]] outside [[Tulu Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/chan/exclusive_arch.asp?ex_id=107 |title=D A I J I W O R L D |publisher=D A I J I W O R L D |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tulu cinema==
{{main|Tulu cinema}}
The [[Tulu cinema]] industry is fairly small; it produces around five films annually. The first film, ''Enna Thangadi'', was released in 1971. Usually these films are released in theatres across the [[Tulu Nadu]] region and on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raveeshkumar.com/2006/08/tulu-cinema-at-35_31.html |title=Ee Prapancha: Tulu Cinema at 35 |publisher=Raveeshkumar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critically acclaimed film ''[[Suddha (film)|Suddha]]'' won the award for Best Indian Film at the [[Osian's Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema]] in [[New Delhi]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1063429/|title=Quiet voices from afar - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=11 November 2006|website=Dnaindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/04/29/stories/2006042903020300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Things Fall Apart | date=2006-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/21/stories/2006072108810200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Filmmaker Extraordinary | date=2006-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, ''[[Oriyardori Asal]]'' (2011) has been the most commercially successful Tulu film.&lt;ref name="'Oriyardori Asal' headed for 175-day run in theatres!"&gt;{{cite web|title='Oriyardori Asal' Headed for 175-day Run in Theatres!|url=http://www.dakshintimes.com/dakshina-kannada/mangalore/news/11114532259/oriyardori-asal-headed-175-day-run-theatres.html|publisher=Dakshintimes.com|accessdate=7 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108190457/http://www.dakshintimes.com/dakshina-kannada/mangalore/news/11114532259/oriyardori-asal-headed-175-day-run-theatres.html|archivedate=8 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaali Polilu]] is the longest-running film in Tulu film history, as well as the highest-grossing film in the Tulu film industry.

Tulu is also taught as a language at the post graduate level in '''[[Mangalore University]]''', and there is a dedicated department for '''Tulu studies, Translation and Research''' at '''[[Dravidian University]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dravidianuniversity.ac.in/tuludept.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512045846/http://dravidianuniversity.ac.in/tuludept.html |archivedate=12 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Kuppam]] [[Andhra Pradesh]].'''The Government Degree College'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kannuruniversity.ac.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=117 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827091932/http://www.kannuruniversity.ac.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=117 |archivedate=27 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; at Kasaragod in Kerala has also introduced a certificate course in Tulu for the academic year 2009-2010. It has also introduced Tulu as an optional subject in its Kannada post-graduation course. It has adopted syllabi from the books published by the Tulu Sahitya Academy.

German missionaries Revs. Kammerer and Männer were the first people to conduct research on the language. Rev. Krammer collected about 3,000 words and their meanings until he died. Later his work was carried on by Rev. Männer, who completed the research and published the first dictionary of the Tulu language in 1886 with the help of the then Madras government. The effort was incomplete, as it did not cover all aspects of the language. The Govinda Pai Research Centre at MGM College, [[Udupi]] started an 18-year Tulu lexicon project in the year 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/sep/22udupi.htm |title=Rediff On The Net: Now, Tulu has a real dictionary! |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different [[dialect]]s, special vocabularies used for different occupational activities, rituals, and folk literature in the forms of [[Paād-danāas]] were included in this project. The Centre has also released a six-volume, trilingual, modestly priced Tulu-[[Kannada]]-[[English language|English]] lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-08/mangalore/28086486_1_lexicon-world-tulu-convention-dictionary |title= Tulu Nighantu a Lexicon That Speaks a Million Words|author= Leena Mudbidri|date= 8 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tulu [[lexicon]] was awarded the Gundert Award for the best [[dictionary]] in the country in 1996.

[[File:Alexandra Ansanelli Aurora Sleeping Beauty Royal Ballet.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexandra Ansanelli]] wearing a classical tutu]]

The modern '''tutu''' is a [[dress]] worn as a [[costume]] in a [[ballet]] [[performance]], often with attached [[bodice]].&lt;ref&gt;Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, "Tutu," in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Dance'' (Oxford University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; It may be made of [[tarlatan]], muslin, silk, tulle, gauze, or nylon. Modern tutus have two basic types: the Romantic tutu is soft and bell-shaped, reaching the calf or ankle; the Classical tutu is short and stiff, projecting horizontally from the waist and hip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/tutu|title=tutu - Definition of tutu in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The derivation of the word ''[[tutu (disambiguation)|tutu]]'' is unknown. The word was not recorded anywhere until 1881.  One theory is that it is simply derived from the word ''[[Tulle (netting)|tulle]]'' (one of the materials from which it is made).{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Another theory is that it derives from French babytalk for bottom (''cucul''): during that era, the ''abonnés'' (rich male subscribers at the [[Paris Opera Ballet]]) were encouraged to mix with the ballet girls in the foyer, and arrange assignations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweeklings.com/cbuchanan/2013/07/01/flowers-of-the-gutter-ballet-companies-as-brothels-from-paris-to-russia/|title=Flowers of the Gutter: Ballet Companies as Brothels from Paris to Russia - The Weeklings|website=TheWeeklings.com|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is suggested the expression came from the abonnés playfully patting the back of the tulle dress with the saying ''pan-pan cucul'' (French for ''I'll spank your bottom'').

A third, related theory suggests a derivation from the more vulgar French word, "cul" (which can be used to refer to the bottom or genital area).  During this era, women (including dancers) wore [[pantalettes]] as underwear, which were open at the crotch.  The abonnés favoured the very front rows in the hope of a scandalous view, and the skirt was modified for that reason.  This is supported by the description by nineteenth-century balletomane, [[Charles-Louis-Étienne Nuitter|Charles Nuitter]], who defined ''tutu'' as "a slang term for the very short petticoat worn by ''danseuses'' in the interest of modesty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cyril W.|last=Beaumont|title=A French-English Dictionary of Technical Terms Used in Classical Ballet|publisher=ISTD|location=London|date=1959|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Sylphide -Marie Taglioni -1832 -2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marie Taglioni]] wearing a Romantic tutu]]

The skirt that became known as the Romantic tutu made its first appearance in 1832 at the Paris Opera, where [[Marie Taglioni]] wore a gauzy white skirt cut to reveal her ankles, designed by Eugene Lami in ''[[La Sylphide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ivor Guest, ''The Romantic Ballet in Paris'' (Alton, Hampshire: Dance Books, 2008), {{ISBN|978-1852731199}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 19th century onwards, the tutu was steadily shortened, for ease of movement and to show off the dancer's legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Victoria and Albert Museum|title=Spotlight: Four Centuries of Costume Design, a Tribute to the Royal Ballet|location=London|publisher=Theatre Museum|date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashion designers have often been involved in design for ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Chazin-Bennahum, ''The Lure of Perfection: Fashion and Ballet, 1780-1830'' (New York: Routledge, 2005), {{ISBN| 978-0415970389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion designers Cecil Beaton in England, Christian Lacroix in France, and Isaac Mizrahi in the United States have all designed tutus. Among the leading makers of tutus around the world, few designers have matched the reputation of [[Barbara Karinska]] (1886-1983), costumer for the New York City Ballet for many years, She designed and constructed tutus of extraordinary beauty and durability.&lt;ref&gt;Toni Bentley, ''Costumes by Karinska'', with a foreword by Edward Gorey (New York: Abrams, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0810935167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tyler Burge''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɜr|dʒ}}; born 1946) is a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at [[UCLA]].  Burge has made contributions to many areas of [[philosophy]], including the [[philosophy of mind]], philosophy of logic, [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of language]], and the [[history of philosophy]].

==Education and career==
Burge earned his Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Princeton University]] in 1971 where he worked with [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and John Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophy.ucla.edu/people/55-tyler-burge.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He joined the UCLA faculty that year (1971), and has taught there ever since, with visiting professorships also at [[Stanford University]], [[Harvard University]], and [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophy.ucla.edu/people/55-tyler-burge.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He is an elected Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] since 1993&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucla.edu/about/awards-and-honors/faculty/american-academy-of-arts-and-sciences&lt;/ref&gt; and a Corresponding Fellow of the [[British Academy]] since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/sections/index.cfm?member=3203&lt;/ref&gt; He was the recipient of the 2010 [[Jean Nicod Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;http://129.199.13.77/seminaires-colloques/conferences-et-prix-jean-nicod/archives/tyler-burge-2010/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical Work==
===Anti-individualism===
Burge has argued for  [[anti-individualism]].  In Burge's words, anti-individualism is a theory that asserts the following:  “individuating many of a person or animal’s mental kinds … is necessarily dependent on relations that the person bears to the physical, or in some cases social, environment".&lt;ref name=Burge2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burge|first1=Tyler|title=Individuation and Self-Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=November 1988|volume=85|issue=11|page=650|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1007312.files/Week%2013/burge%20individualism.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This view, and some variants, has been called "content externalism", or just "[[externalism]]."  Burge favors "anti-individualism" over this terminology, in part because he considers the central issue to be what individuates content, rather than where contents may be located, as "externalism" may suggest. (Burge 2003, 435-6).

[[File:Pg 206 Thigh Muscles.jpg|right|thumb|100px|The patient's belief that arthritis is in his thigh depends on conventional meaning as determined by the linguistic community.]]
Burge argues in a similar fashion that a person's beliefs are dependent on the physical world. In his [[thought experiment]] he attempted to demonstrate that all thoughts and beliefs have wide contents.

In “The Meaning of Meaning” (1975), Putnam had argued that the meaning of a [[natural kind]] term such as “water” depends on the nature of the physical world.  Burge argues that the difference in the thoughts is attributable to the difference between the nature of stuffs in the respective physical environments. As with the "arthritis" thought experiment, dependence of thought on the physical environment is a conclusion that is supposed to follow purely from reflection on the cases in the thought experiment.

Burge has extended the thesis of anti-individualism into the realm of the theory of vision, arguing that the contents of representations posited by a computational theory of vision, such as that pioneered by [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], are dependent on the environment of the organism's evolutionary history. (See Burge 1986.)

Anti-individualism about thoughts is a controversial thesis.  It has been disputed on a number of grounds.  For example, it has been claimed that the thesis undermines a person's authoritative knowledge of their own thought contents. (See, e.g., McKinsey 1991.)  It has also been thought to cause problems for our understanding of the way that mental states cause behavior. (See, e.g., Fodor 1991.)  Burge (1988) has argued that anti-individualism is compatible with knowledge of our own mental states. He has also argued that it presents no problems for our understanding of causation. (See Burge 1989.)

===''Origins of Objectivity''===

Burge published his first book-length monograph in 2010, offering a philosophical account of perception heavily informed by empirical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199581405.do&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was described by one reviewer as "an absolutely terrific work, conceived and executed at a scale and level of ambition rarely seen in contemporary philosophy. The book's primary aim is to contribute a theory of perception; more broadly, however, it also delivers a subtle and nuanced query into the place of distinctively psychological capacities in the natural order."&lt;ref&gt;https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24627-origins-of-objectivity/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other philosophical work===

In the history of philosophy, he has published articles on the philosophy of [[Gottlob Frege]], and René Descartes. A collection of his writings on Frege, along with a substantial introduction and several postscripts by the author, has been published (Burge, 2005).  In epistemology, he has written on such topics as self-knowledge, interlocution, reasoning and memory, and reflection (Burge 2013).  He is perhaps most well known for his contributions to the philosophy of mind, including his views on de re belief &lt;!-- What is "de re belief"? --&gt;and, most notably, [[anti-individualism]] with respect to [[mental content]], which is also known as [[externalism]], the view that the content of one's thoughts depends partly on the external environment.  A [[festschrift]] devoted mostly to Burge's work on anti-individualism, including extensive replies from Burge to the contributors, has also appeared (Hahn and Ramberg 2003). Since 1978, four of Burge's articles have been chosen as among "the ten best" of the year by ''The Philosopher's Annual''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophersannual.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Achille Devéria - Vidocq.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Eugène François Vidocq]], pioneering criminologist and the founder of one of the first undercover police units in the early [[19th century]].]]
To go "'''undercover'''" is to avoid detection by the entity one is observing, and especially to [[deception|disguise]] one's own identity or use an assumed identity for the purposes of gaining the trust of an individual or organization to learn or confirm confidential information or to gain the trust of targeted individuals in order to gather information or evidence. Traditionally, it is a technique employed by [[law enforcement agencies]] or [[private investigators]], and a person who works in such a role is commonly referred to as an [[Espionage|undercover agent]].

== History ==
Undercover work has been used in a variety of ways throughout the course of history, but the first organized, but informal, undercover program was first employed in France by [[Eugène François Vidocq]] in the early 19th century, from the late [[First French Empire|First Empire]] through most of the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. At the end of 1811, Vidocq set up an informal plainclothes unit, the ''[[Brigade]] de la Sûreté'' ("Security Brigade"), which was later converted to a security police unit under the [[Prefecture of Police]]. The Sûreté initially had eight, then twelve, and, in 1823, twenty employees. One year later, it expanded again, to 28 secret agents. In addition, there were eight people who worked secretly for the Sûreté, but instead of a salary, they received licences for gambling halls. A major portion of Vidocq's subordinates were ex-criminals like himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodgetts|first=Edward A.|title=Vidocq. A Master of Crime|year=1928|publisher=Selwyn &amp; Blount|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vidocq personally trained his agents, for example, in selecting the correct disguise based on the kind of job. He himself still went out hunting for criminals too. His memoirs are full of stories about how he outsmarted crooks by pretending to be a beggar or an old [[cuckold]]. At one point, he even simulated his own death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|surname1=Morton, James|title=The First Detective: The Life and Revolutionary Times of Vidocq |publisher=Ebury Press|isbn=978-0-09-190337-4|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the first modern police force was established in 1829 by Sir [[Robert Peel]] as the [[Metropolitan Police]] of [[London]]. From the start, the force occasionally employed plainclothes undercover detectives, but there was much public anxiety that these powers were being used for the purpose of political repression. In part due to these concerns, the 1845 official ''Police Orders'' required all undercover operations to be specifically authorized by the [[superintendent (police)|superintendent]]. It was only in 1869 that Police commissioner [[Edmund Henderson]] established a formal plainclothes detective division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wIf5w6BJOmQC|title=Historical Dictionary of Law Enforcement|author=Mitchel P. Roth, James Stuart Olson|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=271|isbn=978-0-313-30560-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Special Irish Branch.jpg|thumb|left|[[Special Branch]] detectives on an undercover operation at the [[London Docks]], 1911.]]
The first [[Special Branch]] of police was the [[Special Irish Branch]], formed as a section of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] of the [[Metropolitan Police|MPS]] in London in 1883, initially to combat the bombing campaign that the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] had begun a few years earlier. This pioneering branch was the first to be trained in [[counter terrorism]] techniques.

Its name was changed to [[Special Branch]] as it had its remit gradually expanded to incorporate a general role in counter terrorism, combating foreign subversion and infiltrating [[organized crime]]. [[Law enforcement agency|Law enforcement agencies]] elsewhere established similar Branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1fqAZzIDlgYC|title=Dictionary of Policing|author=Tim Newburn, Peter Neyroud|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=262|isbn=978-1-134-01155-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], a similar route was taken with the establishment of the Italian Squad in 1906 by the [[New York City Police Department]] under [[New York City Police Commissioner|police commissioner]] [[William McAdoo (New Jersey)|William McAdoo]] to combat rampant crime and intimidation in the poor Italian neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OB0wOgBbHHkC|title=Italian Americans in Law Enforcement|author=Anne T.

(1988). Undercover: Police Surveillance In America. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Romano2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne T.

== Risks ==
There are two principal problems that can affect agents working in undercover roles. The first is the maintenance of identity and the second is the reintegration back into normal duty.

Living a double life in a new environment presents many problems.  Undercover work is one of the most stressful jobs a special agent can undertake.&lt;ref&gt;Girodo, M. (1991). Symptomatic reactions to undercover work. The [[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]], 179 (10), 626-630.&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest cause of stress identified is the separation of an agent from friends, family and his normal environment. This simple isolation can lead to depression and anxiety.  There is no data on the divorce rates of agents, but strain on relationships does occur.  This can be a result of a need for secrecy and an inability to share work problems, and the unpredictable work schedule, personality and lifestyle changes and the length of separation can all result in problems for relationships.&lt;ref name="Marx, G. 1988"&gt;Marx, G. (1988). Undercover: Police Surveillance In America. Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[stress (biological)|Stress]] can also result from an apparent lack of direction of the investigation or not knowing when it will end.  The amount of elaborate planning, risk, and expenditure can pressure an agent to succeed, which can cause considerable stress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Marx, G. (1988). Undercover: Police Surveillance In America. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The stress that an undercover agent faces is considerably different from his counterparts on regular duties, whose main source of stress is the administration and the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |journal= Work &amp; Stress
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the undercover agents are removed from the bureaucracy, it may result in another problem.  The lack of the usual controls of a uniform, badge, constant supervision, a fixed place of work, or (often) a set assignment could, combined with their continual contact with the [[organized crime]], increase the likelihood for [[Political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

This stress may be instrumental in the development of [[drug]] or alcohol abuse in some agents.  They are more prone to the development of an [[Substance dependence|addiction]] as they suffer greater stress than other police, they are isolated, and drugs are often very accessible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  Police, in general, have very high [[alcoholism]] rates compared to most occupational groups, and stress is cited as a likely factor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  The environment that agents work in often involves a very liberal exposure to the consumption of alcohol,&lt;ref&gt;Girodo, M. (1991). Drug corruptions in undercover agents: Measuring the risks. Behavioural Science and the Law, 9, 361-370.&lt;/ref&gt; which in conjunction with the stress and isolation could result in alcoholism.

There can be some guilt associated with going undercover due to betraying those who have come to trust the officer. This can cause anxiety or even, in very rare cases, sympathy with those being targeted.  This is especially true with the infiltration of political groups, as often the agent will share similar characteristics with those they are infiltrating like class, age, ethnicity or religion.  This could even result in the conversion of some agents.&lt;ref name="Marx, G. 1988" /&gt;

The lifestyle led by undercover agents is very different compared to other areas in law enforcement, and it can be quite difficult to reintegrate back into normal duties.  Agents work their own hours, they are removed from direct supervisory monitoring, and they can ignore the dress and etiquette rules.&lt;ref&gt;Girodo, M. (1991). Personality, job stress, and mental health in undercover agents. Journal of Social Behaviour and Personality, 6 (7), 375-390.&lt;/ref&gt;  So resettling back into the normal police role requires the shedding of old habits, language and dress.  After working such free lifestyles, agents may have discipline problems or exhibit neurotic responses.  They may feel uncomfortable, and take a cynical, suspicious or even paranoid world view and feel continually on guard.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
Other risks include capture, [[death]] and [[torture]].

== Plainclothes law enforcement ==
Undercover agents should not be confused with [[law enforcement officer]]s who wear '''plainclothes'''.  This method is used by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]]. To wear plainclothes is to wear [[civilian]] [[Clothing|clothes]], instead of wearing a [[uniform]], to avoid detection or identification as a law enforcement officer. However, plainclothes police officers typically carry normal police equipment and normal identification. [[Police detective]]s are assigned to wear plainclothes by wearing suits instead of the uniform typically worn by their peers. Police officers in plainclothes must identify themselves when using their police powers; however, they are not required to identify themselves on demand and may lie about their status as a police officer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3019">In [[telecommunications]], a '''voice operated switch''', also known as '''VOX''' or '''voice-operated exchange''', is a switch that operates when sound over a certain threshold is detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Newton's Telecom Dictionary |last=Newton |first=Harry |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=CMP books |location= |isbn= |pages=901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually used to turn on a transmitter or recorder when someone speaks and turn it off when they stop speaking. It is used instead of a [[push-to-talk operation|push-to-talk button]] on transmitters or to save storage space on recording devices. On [[mobile telephone|cell phones]], it is used to save [[battery (electricity)|battery]] life. Intercom systems that use a speaker in a room as both a speaker and a microphone will often use VOX on the main console to switch the audio direction during a conversation. The circuit usually includes a delay between the sound stopping and switching direction, to avoid the circuit turning off during short pauses in speech.

A special case exists, if there is enough energy to power the system directly. For example, a microphone may send a voltage, high enough, to directly operate a transmitter. &lt;ref&gt;http://g3xbm-qrp.blogspot.com/2009/10/sound-powered-transmitters.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with push-to-talk ==
Unlike manual [[push-to-talk]] (PTT) operation, VOX is
automatic; the user can keep his or her hands free while talking. But VOX also has some significant disadvantages that explain why PTT is still common.

Most VOX circuits have a sensitivity adjustment, but unwanted (and sometimes undetected) VOX triggering can still occur on background noise, heavy breathing or a side conversation. Conversely, it may not activate when desired on speech that is too weak.

The VOX in a two-way radio can also be triggered by the loudspeaker carrying the other side of the conversation. This problem can be
minimized with an "anti vox" feature to decrease VOX sensitivity when the receiver is active.

Transmitters and recorders have short but finite activation times that
may clip the beginnings of phrases. Some modern VOX circuits eliminate this problem by recording or transmitting a delayed version of the input signal. An older way of overcoming this, used by pilots, and astronauts, as some of the first users of VOX, was to habitually preface every transmission with "uh" in place of keying the microphone. 

VOX uses a "hang" timer, typically 1-3 seconds, to remain engaged during brief speech pauses. This means the last several seconds of each transmission or recorded segment are always silence. A VOX-activated recorder can delete the end of each segment but the user of a VOX-activated half duplex radio must wait for the timer to expire before he or she can receive again.

'''''Yo''''' is an English [[slang]] [[interjection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/yo|title=Yo - Define Yo at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly associated with [[American English]]. It  was popularized by the [[Italian-American]] community in  [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="flappers2rappers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalzell|first=Tom|title=Flappers 2 Rappers: American Youth Slang|year=1996|publisher=Merriam Webster|location=Springfield, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87779-612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although often used as a greeting, ''yo'' may come at the end of a sentence, often to direct focus onto a particular individual or group or to gain the attention of another individual or group.

==Etymology and history==
The interjection ''yo'' was first used in [[Middle English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/yo?q=yo|title=yo: definition of yo in Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English)|publisher=|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary yo (interjection) etymological definition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=yo (interjection) etymological definition|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=yo&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Mr Douglas Harper|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''yo'', it was also sometimes written ''io''.&lt;ref&gt;''Yo'', Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the term may have been in use in the 16th century, its current popularity stems from its use in Philadelphia's [[Italian American]] population in the twentieth century, which spread to other ethnic groups in the city, notably among the [[African American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalzell|first=Tom|title=Flappers 2 Rappers: American Youth Slang|page=177|publisher=Merriam Webster|location=Springfield, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87779-612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late twentieth century it frequently appeared in [[hip hop music]] and became associated with [[African American Vernacular English]], as seen in the title ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'', a popular American television hip-hop music program in the 1980s.

==Notable uses==
A frequent example of the expression is fictional Philadelphian [[Rocky Balboa]], where the word is used throughout all of the Rocky films, and is part of the iconic line, "Yo, Adrian, I did it!", which was ranked 80th in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|the AFI's list of 100 best movie quotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes400.pdf |title=AFI's List of Nominated Quotes |publisher=American Film Institute |format=PDF |access-date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "[[Yo, Blair]]. What are you doing?" was an informal greeting that [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[George W. Bush]] gave to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]] during the [[G8]] summit in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, on 17 July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Dent (2007) The Language Report: English on the move 2000–2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
* In [[Baltimore]], and possibly other cities, ''yo'' (or a word coincidentally identical to it) has become a [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns|gender-neutral pronoun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005298.html|title=Language Log|publisher=|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many features of the site have been noted by the press, including its culture tests,&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Gael Fashingbauer; ''Star Tribune'' (Minneapolis, MN), June 2, 2001, "An international view of culture offers surprises"&lt;/ref&gt; humorous excerpts from phrase books,&lt;ref&gt;''Informationsdienst'', "Kurz notiert",  April 22, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; its collection of numbers in over 5000 languages,&lt;ref&gt;''Lexington Herald-Leader'' (KY), February 4, 2002, Page A2&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Language Construction Kit''.&lt;ref&gt;''Fairfield County Business Journal''; 12/27/99, Vol. 38 Issue 52, p7, "Surf's Up"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''ComputerSweden'', January 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Deutsche Welle'', September 20, 2004, "Schmeichlerische Sprachmelodien"&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Language Construction Kit==
''The Language Construction Kit''&lt;ref&gt;''Corriere della Sera'', March 8, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', February 21, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; was originally a collection of [[HTML]] documents written by Rosenfelder and hosted at Zompist.com intended to be a guide for making [[constructed language]]s. The LCK proceeds from the simplest aspects of language upward, starting with [[phonology]] and [[writing system]]s, moving on to [[word]]s, going through the complexities of [[grammar]], and ending with an overview of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s and [[dialect]]s. This sensible progression, as well as the warnings against common oversights, frequent use of examples from [[natural language]]s, and healthy dose of [[humor]], has earned the LCK its popular and respected status among the [[Internet]] conlanging [[community]]. It has been translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[German language|German]] by fans, and came out in book form in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zompist.com/lckbook.html Zompist.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenfelder has published several follow-up works: ''Advanced Language Construction'' and ''The Conlanger's Lexipedia'', which get into more detail on certain aspects of conlanging, and ''The Planet Construction Kit'', which is geared towards creating whole fantasy worlds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zompist.com/lckbook.html Zompist.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, Rosenfelder published the ''China Construction Kit.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zompist.com/china.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The Zompist Bulletin Board==
The website has a corresponding [[bulletin board system|bulletin board]], formerly hosted with [[SpinnWebe]] but now with its own domain at www.verduria.org.  The Zompist Bulletin Board (often abbreviated ''ZBB'') is an online forum created for the purpose of discussing [[conlang]]s, [[conworld]]s, and Mark Rosenfelder's own constructed world, ''Almea''. Members of the board share and showcase their own conlangs and conworlds, as well as discuss aspects of the world's languages.

==Almea==
''Almea'' is a fictional world constructed by Mark Rosenfelder, which '''Zompist.com''' is mainly dedicated to. It is populated by several races, known as the ''Thinking Kinds''. The Thinking kinds include the humans, the ''ktuvoks'' (swamp reptiles considered demons by most Almean humans), the ''iliu'' (ancient wise aquatic race, playing a role similar to elves in Tolkien's mythos), the ''flaids'' (said to be 'friendly but insane'), the ''elcari'' (hard-working mountain dwellers comparable to Tolkien's dwarves), and the ''icëlani'' (more primitive relatives of humans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zompist.com/verbio.htm |title= The descent of lesüasi |website=Zompist.com|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almea's main continent, Ereláe, has several nations, including Verduria, which is the most detailed, Dhekhnam, which is a ktuvok empire (meaning that humans function as slaves to the ''ktuvoks'' there, much like blacks were slaves to whites in the [[Confederate States of America|South]]), and Skouras, a detailed maritime nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zompist.com/almea.htm |title= Cultures of Ereláe|website=Zompist.com|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ereláe also has a detailed historical atlas, which was inspired by the New Penguin Historical Atlases.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In addition to the various atlases and languages, there is also a wiki called the Almeopedia, which works as an encyclopedic reference. The part of the website devoted to Almea, Virtual Verduria, also includes a range of stories and guides to various subjects, including drawing and maps.

Languages of Almea described on the website include:
{{div col|colwidth=18em}}
*[[Verdurian language|Verdurian]]
*Ismaîn
*Barakhinei
*Caďinor
*Cuêzi
*Axunašin
*Xurnese
*Proto-Eastern
*Kebreni
*Munkhâshi
*Wede:i
*Old Skourene
*Elkarîl
*Flaidish
*Uyseʔ
*Lé
*Dhekhnami
{{div col end}}

Most words in those languages have etymologies, being derived from proto-languages (like Proto-Eastern above) by means of sound changes, and are given historical backgrounds, resulting in the presence of loan-words.
