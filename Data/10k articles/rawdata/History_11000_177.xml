'''Bamburgh''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|m|b|ər|ə}} {{respell|BAM|bər|ə}}) is a village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] on the coast of [[Northumberland]], England.

The village is notable for the nearby [[Bamburgh Castle]], a castle which was the seat of the former [[List of monarchs of Northumbria|Kings of Northumbria]], and for its association with the [[Victorian era]] heroine [[Grace Darling]], who is buried there.

The extensive beach by the village was awarded the [[Blue Flag beach|Blue Flag]] rural beach award in 2005. The [[Bamburgh Dunes]], a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], stand behind the beach. Bamburgh is popular with holidaymakers and is within the [[Northumberland Coast]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].

==History==
The site now occupied by [[Bamburgh Castle]] was previously home to a fort of the indigenous [[Celtic Britons]] known as ''Din Guarie''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainBernaccia.htm|title=Bernaccia (Bryneich / Berneich)|publisher=The History Files|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may have been the capital of the kingdom of [[Bernicia]], the realm of the [[Gododdin]] people,&lt;ref&gt;'An English empire: Bede and the early Anglo-Saxon kings' by N. J. Higham, Manchester University Press ND, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7190-4423-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-4423-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the realm's foundation in c. 420 until 547, the year of the first written reference to the castle. In that year the [[citadel]] was captured by the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ruler [[Ida of Bernicia]] (Beornice) and became Ida's seat.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - Ingram Translation|''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'']], entry for 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late medieval British author [[Thomas Malory]] identified Bamburgh Castle with [[Joyous Gard]], the mythical castle home of [[Lancelot|Sir Launcelot]] in [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vjEyDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA536&amp;lpg=PA536&amp;dq=Joyous+Gard+Bamburgh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CxgXejkNwm&amp;sig=iOi2OhyBeYqNTxS-23MaBNkh3y8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjubGe09vbAhUBLMAKHa4CDng4ChDoAQg3MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Joyous%20Gard%20Bamburgh&amp;f=false|title=The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: Concise Volume A - Third Edition|first= Joseph |last=Black|page=536|publisher=Broadview|year=2016|isbn=978-1554813124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==St Aidan's Church==
[[File:St Aidan's Church, Bamburgh - geograph.org.uk - 77241.jpg|thumbnail|[[St Aidan's Church, Bamburgh]]]]
According to [[Bede]], [[St Aidan]] built a wooden church outside the castle wall in AD 635, and he died here in AD 652. A wooden beam preserved inside the church is traditionally said to be the one on which he rested as he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staidan-bamburgh.co.uk/|title=St Aidan, Bamburgh|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present church dates from the late 12th century, though some pre-[[Norman conquest of England|conquest]] stonework survives in the north aisle. The chancel, said to be the second longest in the country (60&amp;nbsp;ft; 18m), was added in 1230; it contains an 1895 reredos in Caen stone by W.S. Hicks, depicting northern saints of the 7th and 8th centuries. There is an effigy of local heroine [[Grace Darling]] in the North Aisle. This formed part of the original [[Monument to Grace Darling]] but was removed due to weathering of the stonework. Her memorial is sited in the churchyard in such a position that it can be seen by passing ships.&lt;ref&gt;Purves, Churches of Newcastle and Northumberland, Tempus, Stroud, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
An [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] of the same name exists. This ward includes [[Belford, Northumberland|Belford]] and also stretches south to [[Ellingham, Northumberland|Ellingham]] with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 4,846.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/bamburgh-e05008022#sthash.KthaFkv1.dpbs|title=Parish Population 2011|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bamburgh Lighthouse was built by [[Trinity House]] in 1910 to guide shipping both passing along the Northumberland coast and in the waters around the [[Farne Islands]]. It was extensively modernised in 1975 and is now monitored from the Trinity House Operations and Planning Centre in [[Harwich]]. Routine maintenance is carried out by a local attendant. It is the most northerly land-based [[lighthouse]] in England.&lt;ref name="Trinity House"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses-and-lightvessels/bamburgh-lighthouse| title = Bamburgh Lighthouse | work = | publisher = Trinity House | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When originally built, the lamp was mounted on a skeletal steel tower (the footprint of which can still be seen within the compound) which stood alongside the white building which housed an [[acetylene]] plant to power the lamp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photographers-resource.co.uk/A_heritage/Lighthouses/LG2_EW/Bamburgh_lighthouse.htm Vintage postcard showing original arrangement.]&lt;/ref&gt; (A similar arrangement can be seen today at [[Peninnis Lighthouse]].) During electrification in 1975 the tower was removed, and the lantern was placed instead on top of the (now redundant) acetylene building.&lt;ref name="Trinity House"/&gt;

'''Božidar Prokić''' ([[Zabojnica]], near [[Kragujevac]], [[Principality of Serbia]], 11 October 1859 – [[Belgrade]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], 6 May 1922) was a Serbian historian and first [[Byzantinist]]. He was the principal founder of [[Byzantine Studies]] as an independent academic discipline at the [[University of Belgrade]] in 1906. His work is considered a significant contribution to the study and understanding of [[John Skylitzes]] and the history of the origin and development of the [[Bulgarian Empire]] under [[Samuel of Bulgaria]]. Also, he was the director of the [[National Archives of Serbia]] at the most difficult time, the Balkan Wars and the First World War that followed.

==Biography== 
After graduating from Belgrade's ''[[Grandes écoles]]'', Prokić went to the University of Paris to further his studies. In 1892 he was invited to the [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]] where he collaborated in Byzantine Studies with [[Karl Krumbacher]]. At the time Krumbacher was being appointed  to the newly-established chair in Byzantinistik at the university. Krumbacher and his associates began establishing Byzantine Studies as an independent academic discipline in modern universities.

Božidar Prokić was named professor of Medieval History at the [[Grandes écoles]] shortly after his arrival from Germany in 1892. Thirteen years later that institution of higher learning became the [[University of Belgrade]] in 1905.

His most important work is ''Die Zusätze in der Handschrift des Johannes Skylitzes'', published in 1906. A second edition was published later. The value of the work was greatly enhanced by its bibliographies and it remained a standard textbook for Byzantine studies for many years to come.

From 1892 until 1905 he taught at his ''alma mater'' until it became the University of Belgrade. Then he tried to convince the governors to establish a chair in Byzantinistik, like his colleague Krumbacher did in 1892 in Munich, but not fully satisfied with the university's transformation and the post he was offered, he resigned soon after. From 1911 he was the director of the National Archives of Serbia in Belgrade.

== Legacy ==
One might consider Božidar Prokić, the father of southern Slavic Byzantology, since he trained and inspired the first generation of Byzantists, including [[Dragutin Anastasijevic]]. The University of Belgrade also gave Byzantine Studies a Russian-born scholar -- [[George Ostrogorsky]].

The '''Cabinda War''' is an ongoing separatist insurgency, waged by the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]] (FLEC) against the government of [[Angola]]. FLEC aims at the restoration of the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Cabinda]], located within the borders of the [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda province]] of Angola.

==Background==
The area of modern-day Cabinda was first explored by navigator [[Diogo Cão]] in 1483, later falling under Portuguese influence. In 1853 a delegation of Cabindan chiefs unsuccessfully requested the extension of Portuguese administration from the colony of Angola to Cabinda. Local chiefs continued their attempts at cooperating with Portugal until the 1884 [[Berlin Conference]] and the 1885 [[Treaty of Simulambuco]], following which the Cabindan enclave became a Portuguese protectorate. Despite the fact that Cabinda held a semi independent status, a new Portuguese government elected in 1956 transferred the region's administration to Angolan without a prior agreement with Cabinda's local leadership.&lt;ref name=GoaLY/&gt;&lt;ref name=Famir/&gt;

The first Cabindan separatist movement known as Associaco dos Indigenas do Enclave de Cabinda (AlEC) was formed in 1956, AIEC advocated the creation of a union between Cabinda and [[Belgian Congo]] or [[French Congo]]. Associacao dos Ressortissants do Enclave de Cabinda (AREC) was founded in 1959 as humanitarian organisation, AREC was renamed into Freedom Movement for the State of Cabinda (MLEC), shifting its role into a political movement promoting self-determination. The National Action Committee of the Cabindan People (CAUNC) and the Mayombé Alliance (ALLIAMA) joined the growing political scene in the same year. In 1963, MLEC, ALLIAMA and CAUNC merged into the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]] (FLEC), which had since been the largest self-determination movement in the region.&lt;ref name=GoaLY/&gt;

On the same year, the [[Organisation of African Unity]] declared that Cabinda is an independently governed state with its own independence movement. On 10 January 1967, FLEC formed a government in exile based in the town of Tshela, Zaire. In August 1974, FLEC absorbed the Democratic Union of Cabindan Peoples and the Democratic Party of Cabinda, becoming the sole political organisation in Cabinda.&lt;ref name=Famir&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?id=163016&amp;lng=en|title=FLEC-Cabinda Secessionism|work=Wikileaks|date=September 2011|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1974LUANDA00819_b.html|title=CABINDAN NATIONALISM AND THE POSSIBLE NEED FOR A U.S. POLICY DECISION|work=Wikileaks|date=24 September 1974|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saqjo/&gt;

In January 1975 under pressure from Angolan liberation movements, Portugal accepted Cabinda as part of Angola in the [[Alvor Agreement]] where the 3 Angolan independence movements ([[MPLA]], [[UNITA]] and FNLA) were present, denying Cabinda the right to self-determination previously granted by the U.N. Chart/Right to Self-determination and the [[Treaty of Simulambuco]]. On 1 August 1975, FLEC president [[Luis Ranque Franque]] announced the formation of the [[Republic of Cabinda]], an independent state. The MPLA troops controlling the region at the time ignored the statement.&lt;ref name=Saqjo/&gt; In November 1975, Angola gained independence from Portugal, claiming Cabinda as part of its territory. The provisional Cabindan government, led by the [[FLEC]], was overturned. On 8 November 1975, FLEC responded by initiating armed struggle, aiming at creating a separate Cabindan state.&lt;ref name=fewS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/cabinda.htm|title=Cabinda|author=John Pike|publisher=Global Security|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TlA/&gt;

==Conflict==
In the course of the [[Angolan Civil War]], FLEC split into five independent factions. FLEC-Posiçao Militaire (FLEC-PM) was later renamed
into FLEC-Renovada (FLEC-R),  FLEC-N'Zita, FLEC-Lubota,  Uniao Nacional de Libertaçao de Cabinda (UNLC) and the [[Communist Committee of Cabinda]]. As the war continued the [[MPLA]] led government attempted to gain the support of the various FLEC factions and enter negotiations. On the other hand, [[UNITA]] rebels directly collaborated with FLEC-FAC, while seeking to broaden its alliance with the group. The above did not stop UNITA from occasionally collaborating with MPLA in anti-FLEC operations. In 2002, the Angolan government signed a peace deal with UNITA officially ending the civil war.&lt;ref name=KWak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ac5010.html|title=Angola: Information on an anti-government group called Frente Liberaccion d'Enclave Cabinda (FLEC)|work=Refworld|date=1 November 1995|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.elpais.com/africa-no-es-un-pais/2012/05/que-pasa-en-cabinda.html|title=¿Qué pasa en...

[[Cuba]], [[East Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] entered the civil war on MPLA's side in 1975, soon invading Cabinda.&lt;ref name=Uss/&gt;&lt;ref name=czH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thCentury/articles/cubansinafrica.aspx|title=Castro in Africa: Cuba's Operation Carlotta, 1975|work=Military History Online|date=2 March 2008|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to U.S. intelligence services, [[France]] and [[Belgium]] allegedly supported FLEC by providing training and financial aid, despite the fact that [[Zaire]] remained FLEC's main foreign supporter. FLEC-Renovada received support from a number of US, South African and Japanese right wing organisations as well as the [[World League for Freedom and Democracy]].&lt;ref name=Fr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1974KINSHA08998_b.html|title=RUMORED FRENCH AID TO CABINDA LIBERATION MOVEMENT|work=Wikileaks|date=25 October 1974|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zai&gt;{{cite web|url=

In 1956, oil was first discovered in the region; by 1966, [[Gulf Oil Company]] began commercial exploitation. The large amounts of revenue generated by oil royalties contributed to the rise of Cabinda's geopolitical significance. By 1970, oil revenues amounted to $16 million and were expected to rise to $32–50 million by 1972. Oil continued to play an important role; by 2011 it represented approximately 86% of the Angolan state’s total earnings. The marginalisation of the local population in favor of Portuguese and later Angolan interests played an important role in the rise of separatist militancy in the region.&lt;ref name=Famir/&gt;

On 18 July 2006, the Cabinda Forum for Dialogue (FCD) and FLEC-Renovada led by [[António Bento Bembe]] signed a second definite cease fire with the Angolan government known as the Memorandum of Understanding for Peace in Cabinda. The event took place in Macabi, Cabinda. The agreement assured Cabinda's status as a part of Angola, provided special economic status and local governance powers to Cabinda, and condemned further acts of insurgency and separatism. The treaty received criticism from Bembe's opponents within the movement. The peace accord marked a sharp decrease in the conflict's intensity.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06LUANDA740_a.html|title=ANGOLA – SECOND, "DEFINITIVE" CEASE-FIRE SIGNED IN CABINDA|work=Wikileaks|date=19 July 2006|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wikileaks.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06LUANDA673_a.html|title=ANGOLA – GRA READY TO SIGN PEACE ACCORD IN CABINDA|work=Wikileaks|date=30 July 2006|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International intervention in the conflict has been limited, with [[Portugal]] offering a mediation role and letting the FLEC rule a delegation in [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://escolapau.uab.cat/img/programas/procesos/06anuarie.pdf|title=Procesos de Paz|work=Escola Pau|date=2006|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report indicates that between September 2007 and March 2009, 38 people were [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary detained]], tortured, humiliated and later put on trial for alleged security crimes. The arrested included six members of the Angolan military who were charged with desertion and carrying out armed attacks, as well as a former [[Voice of America]] journalist, known for his criticism of the government. The detainees were denied contact with legal professionals or their families for prolonged periods of time. The above are considered to be a violation of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/83879/section/3|title=They Put Me in the Hole {{!}} Section 3|work=HRW|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/83879/section/7|title=They Put Me in the Hole {{!}} Section 7|work=HRW|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/83879/section/8|title=They Put Me in the Hole {{!}} Section 8|work=HRW|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Bertelsmann Stiftung]] investigation covering the period between 2011 and 2013, indicated that systematic human rights violations have taken place, with journalists, civil rights activists and clergy members receiving harassment after being accused of supporting FLEC.
Reports by [[Freedom House]], Bertelsmann Stiftung and Human Rights Watch also pointed out at violations committed by FLEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/397283/TreatmentofCabindans.pdf|title=Treatment of persons from Cabinda|work=UK Home Office|date=January 2015|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claire Boudreau''', {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRHSC|AIH}} (born 1965) is a Canadian [[history|historian]], [[genealogy|genealogist]], and [[Officer of Arms|officer of arms]]. She has served as a [[herald]] in the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] since 17 March 1997 in the office of [[Saguenay Herald]] and later as [[Saint-Laurent Herald]], to which office she succeeded on the retirement of [[Auguste Vachon]], and then Deputy Chief Herald from 1 December 2005 until 16 June 2007, when she was made the second [[Chief Herald of Canada]] following the retirement of [[Robert Watt]].  She is also a nationally and internationally recognized scholar in heraldic studies. She is the author of many articles and publications. She has been the principal designer and administrator of the authority's pioneering online [[Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada]], which was unveiled in July 2005. She has been an Academician of the [[Académie Internationale d'Héraldique]] since 2000.

==Arms==
{{Infobox COA wide
|image = 
|crest = A panther rampant Azure incensed proper
|escutcheon = Azure an orle Argent
|supporters = Two panthers incensed holding a girdle book and standing on a rocky mount proper
|badge = A panther's face Azure incensed proper jessant-de-lis Argent
|motto = ARDENTE 
|symbolism = The blue colour represents the French origins of Claire Boudreau. The narrow line (orle) appears as a second shield within the main shield and highlights both the importance of heraldry in her life and her doctoral research in this field. The orle and the overall simplicity of the design express both the absolute notion of the Cartesian "whole", contained but continuous, and the idea that infinity can be contained within the span of one's life or within any other given framework. The panther in the crest is a monster spewing fire from its mouth, nostrils and ears. It is the most appropriate symbol to express human passion in any domain. The heraldic panther is endowed with the body of a lion, a horse's head with horns, a griffin's forelegs and a lion's hind legs. This diversified nature makes it a symbol of tolerance and of the spirit of adventure by which alone the frontiers of the unknown can be pushed back. Repeating the symbolism of the crest, the multicoloured panthers are based on examples found in mediaeval miniatures. They hold mediaeval "girdle books", which were portable books held to the owner's belt by a knot in their binding. These indicate that the best inventions are often simple and eminently practical concepts.ARDENTE ("fervent"), along with the panther in the crest is a reference to the totemic name "Panthère ardente" ("Fiery panther") given to Claire Boudreau within the Scout movement in 1978. The motto therefore contains a second allusion to passion, a sort of internal flame that drives one to outstanding achievements.

The '''Classical Association''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[learned society]] in the field of [[classics]], and a registered charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|313371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The association was founded on 19 December 1903, and its objects are defined in its constitution as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalassociation.org/Constitution/Constitution.pdf|title=The Classical Association Constitution|accessdate=2009-01-13 |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The advancement of education by the promotion, development and maintenance of classical studies
# To increase public awareness of the contribution and importance of classics to education and public life.

==Publications==
The Association publishes three journals:  ''Classical Review'', ''Classical Quarterly'' and ''Greece &amp; Rome'', and a newspaper ''Classical Association News'' (sometimes abbreviated to CA News).  Its other activities include work with schools, conferences, and the award of grants. Its past presidents include novelist [[Lindsey Davis]]. The association celebrated its centenary in 2003 by publishing a book, ''The Classical Association: the First Century 1903-2003'', edited by Dr Christopher Stray; this includes a history of the association and studies of various aspects of its activities over the century, including an account of the [[Classical Association of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalassociation.org/Centenary/Centenary.html|title=Centenary 1903-2003|work=Classical Association|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the merger of the [[Joint Association of Classical Teachers]] into the Classical Association in 2015, the Classical Association took over publication of JACT's journals, the ''Journal of Classics Teaching'' (which went online only) and ''Omnibus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalassociation.org/teaching.html|title=Teaching|author=|date=|website=www.classicalassociation.org|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jact.org/ca-merger/|title=jact.org - This website is for sale! - jact classics classical greek greece latin rome roman ancient history omnibus bulletin Resources and Information. |author=|date=|website=www.jact.org|accessdate=23 April 2018 |deadurl=usurped}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

[[File:Etymological Relationships Tree.png|thumb|Diagram showing relationships between etymologically-related words]]

In [[linguistics]], '''cognates''' are [[word]]s that have a common [[etymology|etymological]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Crystal |editor-first=David |editorlink=David Crystal |date=2011 |title=A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics |edition=6th |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZPQVuSgDAkC&amp;pg=PT104 |chapter=cognate |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |page=104 |isbn=978-1-4443-5675-5 |oclc=899159900 |access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cognate etymon need not be inherited directly from a proto-language; the etymon can be borrowed from some other language, in which evolution produces cognate forms. For example, the [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:dish#English|dish]]'' and the [[German language|German]] word ''[[wikt:Tisch#German|Tisch]]'' ("table") are cognates because they both come from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:discus#Latin|discus]]'', which relates to their flat surfaces. Cognates may have evolved similar, different or even opposite meanings, but in most cases there are some similar letters in the word. Some words sound similar, but don't come from the same root; these are called false cognates.

In [[etymology]], the ''cognate'' category excludes [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] and [[loanword]]s. The word ''cognate'' derives from the Latin noun ''[[:wikt:cognatus|cognatus]]'', which means "blood relative".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/cognate "cognate"], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed.: "Latin ''cognātus'': ''co-'', co- + ''gnātus'', born, past participle of ''nāscī'', to be born." Other definitions of the English word include "[r]elated by blood; having a common ancestor" and "[r]elated or analogous in nature, character, or function".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Cognates do not need to have the same meaning, which [[semantic drift|may have changed]] as the languages developed separately. For example [[English language|English]] ''[[wikt:starve#English|starve]]'' and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''[[wikt:sterven#Dutch|sterven]]'' or [[German language|German]] ''[[wikt:sterben|sterben]]'' ("to die") all derive from the same [[Proto-Germanic]] root, ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/sterbaną|*sterbaną]]'' ("die"). ''Discus'' is from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''δίσκος'' (from the verb ''δικεῖν'' "to throw"). A later and separate English reflex of ''discus'', probably through [[medieval Latin]] ''desca'', is ''[[wikt:desk#English|desk]]'' (see [[OED]] s.v. ''desk'').

Cognates also do not need to have similar forms: English ''[[wikt:father|father]]'', [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:père#French|père]]'', and Armenian [[wikt:հայր|հայր]] (''hayr'') all descend directly from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*ph₂tḗr''.

==Across languages==
Examples of cognates in [[Indo-European languages]] are the words ''night'' ([[English language|English]]), ''nuit'' ([[French language|French]]), ''noche'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''Nacht'' ([[German language|German]]), ''nacht'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''nag'' ([[Afrikaans]]), ''nicht'' ([[Scots language|Scots]]), ''natt'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''nat'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''nátt'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''nótt'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''noc'' ([[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Polish language|Polish]]), ночь, ''noch'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]), ноќ, ''noć'' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]), нощ, ''nosht'' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]), ''ніч'', ''nich'' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), ''ноч'', ''noch''/''noč'' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]), ''noč'' ([[Slovene language|Slovene]]), ''noć'' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]]), νύξ, ''nyx'' ([[Ancient Greek]], ''νύχτα''/''nychta'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''nox/nocte'' ([[Latin]]), ''nakt-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''natë'' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]), ''nos'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''nueche'' ([[Asturian language|Asturian]]), ''noite'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]), ''notte'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''nit'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''nuèch/nuèit'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]), ''noapte'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]), ''nakts'' ([[Latvian language|Latvian]]), ''naktis'' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]) and ''Naach'' ([[Colognian language|Colognian]]), all meaning "night" and being derived from the Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/nókʷts|*nókʷts]]}} "night".

Another Indo-European example is ''star'' ([[English language|English]]), ''str-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''tara'' ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]), ''tora'' ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]), ''astre''/''étoile'' ([[French language|French]]), ''ἀστήρ (astēr)'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] or ''ἀστέρι''/''ἄστρο'', ''asteri''/''astro'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''astro/stella'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''aster'' ([[Latin]]) ''stea'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), ''stairno'' ([[Gothic language|Gothic]]), ''astgh'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]), ''Stern'' ([[German language|German]]), ''ster'' (Dutch and [[Afrikaans]]), ''Schtähn'' ([[Colognian language|Colognian]]), ''starn'' (Scots), ''stjerne'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and Danish), ''stjarna'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''stjärna'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''stjørna'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''setāre'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]), ''stoorei'' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]), ''seren'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''steren'' ([[Cornish language|Cornish]]), ''estel'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''estela'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]) ''estrella'' and ''astro'' [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''estrella'' [[Asturian language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]], ''estrela'' and ''astro'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]) and ''estêre'' or ''stêrk'' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), from the Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/h₂stḗr|*h₂stḗr]]}} "star".

The [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|سلام}} ''salām'', the [[Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|שלום}} ''shalom'', the [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] ''shlama'' and the [[Amharic language|Amharic]] ''selam'' ("peace") are also cognates, derived from the [[Proto-Semitic]] [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Semitic/šalām-|*šalām-]] "peace".

Cognates may often be less easily recognised than the above examples, and authorities sometimes differ in their interpretations of the evidence. The English word ''[[wikt:milk#English|milk]]'' is clearly a cognate of German ''[[wikt:Milch#German|Milch]]'', Dutch ''[[wikt:melk#Dutch|melk]]'', Russian ''[[wikt:молоко#Russian|молоко (moloko)]]'' and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Slovene_language|Slovenian]] ''mleko'', also Montenegrin ''[[wikt:mlijeko#Serbo-Croatian|mlijeko]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Compare also Greek [[wikt:ἀμέλγω#Ancient Greek|ἀμέλγω]] ''amelgō'' "to milk".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, French ''[[wikt:lait#French|lait]]'', Catalan ''llet'', Italian ''latte'', Romanian ''[[wikt:lapte#Romanian|lapte]]'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''[[wikt:leche#Spanish|leche]]'' and ''[[wikt:leite#Portuguese|leite]]'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]) (all meaning "milk") are less-obvious cognates of [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|[[wikt:γάλακτος#Ancient Greek|γάλακτος]]}}'' ''gálaktos'' (genitive singular of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:γάλα#Ancient Greek|γάλα]]}} ''gála'', "milk"), a relationship that is more evidently seen through the intermediate Latin ''[[wikt:lac#Latin|lac]]'' "milk" as well as the English word ''[[wikt:lactic#English|lactic]]'' and other terms borrowed from Latin. All of them come from Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/h₂melǵ-|h₂melǵ-]]}} "milk".

Some cognates are semantic opposites. For instance, while the Hebrew word {{Hebrew|חוצפה}} ''[[chutzpah]]'' means "impudence," its [[Classical Arabic]] cognate {{lang|ar|حصافة}} ''ḥaṣāfah'' means "sound judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Hans|authorlink=Hans Wehr |editor= J. Milton Cowan| title=[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] |origyear=1979 |year=1994 |publisher=Spoken Language Services, Inc. |location=[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], [[Illinois]] |isbn=0-87950-003-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within the same language==
Cognates within a single language, or ''[[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]]'', may have meanings that are slightly or even totally different.  For example, English ''ward'' and ''guard'' (&lt;PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/wer-|*wer-]]'', "to perceive, watch out for") are cognates, as are ''shirt'' (garment on top) and ''skirt'' (garment on bottom) (&lt;PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/sker-|*sker-]]'', "to cut"). In some cases, including this one, one cognate ("skirt") has an ultimate source in another language related to English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Harper |first= Douglas  |date= |title= skirt (n.).|url=  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=skirt |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |location= |access-date=2017-06-16 | archiveurl=  | archivedate= | quote=early 14c., "lower part of a woman's dress," from Old Norse ''skyrta'' "shirt, a kind of kirtle" }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but the other one ("shirt") is native.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Harper |first= Douglas  |date= |title= shirt (n.).|url=  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shirt |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |location= |access-date=2017-06-16 | archiveurl=  | archivedate= | quote=Old English ''scyrte'' "skirt, tunic," from Proto-Germanic *''skurtjon'' "a short garment"  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That happened with many loanwords, such as ''skirt'' in this example, which was borrowed from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] during the [[Danelaw]].

Sometimes both doublets come from other languages, often the same one but at different times. For example, the word ''chief'' (meaning the leader of any group) comes from the [[Middle French]] ''chef'' ("head"), and its modern pronunciation preserves the Middle French consonant sound; the word ''chef'' (the leader of the cooks) was borrowed from the same source centuries later, but by then, the consonant had changed to a "sh" sound in French. Such word sets can also be called [[etymological twins]], and they may come in groups of higher numbers, as with, for example, the words ''wain'' (native), ''waggon/wagon'' (Dutch), and ''vehicle'' (Latin) in English.

A word may also [[loanword|enter another language]], develop a new form or meaning there, and be re-borrowed into the original language; that is called [[reborrowing]]. For example, the Greek word ''κίνημα'' (''kinima'', "movement") became French ''cinéma'' (compare American English ''movie'') and then later returned to Greece as ''σινεμά'' (''sinema'', "the art of film", "movie theater"). In Greek, ''κίνημα'' (''kinima'', "movement") and ''σινεμά'' (''sinema'', "filmmaking, cinema") are now doublets.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, ''σινεμά'' stands beside a Greek [[neologism]] based on the original form of the same root, ''κινηματογράφος'' (''kinimatoγráfos''), with the same two meanings as ''cinéma''/''σινεμά''. (The film or movie itself is the unrelated ''ταινία'' (''tainia'').)&lt;/ref&gt;

A less obvious English-language doublet pair is ''[[wikt:grammar|grammar]]'' and ''[[wikt:glamour|glamour]]''.

==False cognates==
[[False cognates]] are words that people commonly believe are related (have a common origin), but that linguistic examination reveals are unrelated. For example, on the basis of superficial similarities, the Latin verb ''habēre'' and German ''haben'', both meaning 'to have', appear to be cognates. However, because the words evolved from different roots, in this case, different [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) roots, they cannot be cognate (see for example [[Grimm's law]]). German ''haben'', like English ''have'', comes from PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/kh₂pyé-|*kh₂pyé-]]'' 'to grasp', and its real cognate in Latin is ''capere'', 'to seize, grasp, capture'. Latin ''habēre'', on the other hand, is from PIE ''*gʰabʰ'', 'to give, to receive', and hence cognate with English ''give'' and German ''geben''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, English ''much'' and Spanish ''mucho'' look similar and have a similar meaning but are not cognates, as they evolved from different roots: ''much'' from Proto-Germanic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/mikilaz|*mikilaz]]'' &lt; PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/meg-|*meǵ-]]'' and ''mucho'' from Latin ''multum'' &lt; PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/mel-|*mel-]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ringe|first1=Don|title=A quick introduction to language change|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/3-22.pdf|website=Univ. of Pennsylvania: Linguistics 001 (Fall 2011)|accessdate=15 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620051440/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/3-22.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-20|location=¶ 29|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cristina Rivera Garza''' (born October 1, 1964)&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite web |author= |title= Cristina Rivera Garza |publisher= Enciclopedia de la Literature de México  |url= http://www.elem.mx/autor/datos/929|accessdate=November 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[List of Mexican-American writers|Mexican author]] and professor best known for her fictional work, with various novels such as ''Nadie me verá llorar'' winning a number of Mexico’s highest literary awards as well as awards abroad. The author was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], near the U.S. border and has developed her career in teaching and writing on both sides of the border. She has taught history and creative writing at various universities such as the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM), [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Toluca|Tec de Monterrey, Campus Toluca]] and her current position at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. Awards include the Juan Vicente Melo National Short Story Award, [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Prize]] (the only author to win this award twice) and the Anna Seghers International Prize.

==Life==
Rivera Garza was born in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]], in the northeast of Mexico near the border with the United States.&lt;ref name=writersorg&gt;{{cite web |title= Rivera Garza, Cristina |publisher=Writers Org |url= https://www.escritores.org/biografias/143-cristina-rivera-garza |accessdate=November 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tusquetseditores&gt;{{cite web |title= Catálogo / Autores / Rivera Garza, Cristina |publisher=Tusquets Publishers |url= http://www.tusquetseditores.com/autor/cristina-rivera-garza |accessdate=November 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is bilingual in English and Spanish with her desire to write forming her teen years.&lt;ref name=crsamuelson&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cheyla Rose Samuelson  |title= Writing at Escape Velocity: An interview with Cristina Rivera Garza |journal= Confluenica  |publisher= University of Northern Colorado |volume=23 |issue=1 |date=Fall 2007 |pages=135–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcricalde&gt;{{cite web |author= Maricruz Castro Ricalde |title= Hibridismo y otredad en Nadie me verá llorar de Cristina Rivera Garza |publisher=UAEM |location=Toluca |url= http://www.uaemex.mx/plin/colmena/Colmena45/Libros/Maricruz.html |accessdate=November 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She did her undergraduate studies at ENEP-Acatlán (part of UNAM) in sociology, then went on to study her master’s in Latin American history at UNAM.&lt;ref name=writersorg/&gt;&lt;ref name=tusquetseditores/&gt; She holds a Ph.D. in History from the University of Houston (1995).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uh.edu/class/history/graduate/phd-recipients/&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctoral thesis was on the subjection of the human body to state power in mental asylums in early 20th century Mexico.&lt;ref name=crsamuelson/&gt;

She has lived in various places in Mexico as well as in the United States, developing her teaching career on both sides of the border, living in [[Mexico City]], [[Toluca]], [[Houston]] and [[San Diego]].&lt;ref name=tusquetseditores/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcricalde/&gt;&lt;ref name=bkeizman&gt;{{cite journal |author=Betina Keizman |title= El blog de Cristina Rivera Garza: Experiencia literaria y terreno de contienda |journal= Chasqui |volume=42 |issue=1 |date=May 2013 |pages=3–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera Garza spent some of her “decisive years” studying in Mexico City, which she says has given her a personal and intimate relationship with Mexico’s capital, featured in her novel “Nadie me verá llorar.” However, she never permanently moved to the capital, which is Mexico’s literary center, making her feel outside of the country’s literary scene. She has also stated that she does not like the concentration of Mexico’s culture on the capital.&lt;ref name=crsamuelson/&gt;

While she declines to use words to describe herself, she does state that “I am me and my keyboard.”  She states that her personality is not fixed, and such would be limiting.&lt;ref name=jlherrera&gt;{{cite web |author= Jorge Luis Herrera  |title= Entrevista con Cristina Rivera Garza: El amor es una reflexión, un volver atrás |publisher=CONACULTA |location=Mexico |url= http://www.reneavilesfabila.com.mx/universodeelbuho/60/herrera60.pdf|accessdate=November 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera Garza maintains interests in narrative, history, and the nature of human language/communication.&lt;ref name=crsamuelson/&gt; She believes that writing can be a question of life or death,  and that writers should misbehave in real life as well as in the imagination to be connected to the world and better able to tell stories.&lt;ref name=mmateos&gt;{{cite news |author= Mónica Mateos-Vega  |title= Cristina Rivera Garza altera la realidad y la describe de manera alucinante |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=June 21, 2012 |page=4 |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2012/06/21/cultura/a04n1cul |accessdate=November 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching career==
She has always had a full-time job in teaching, which limits her time for creative writing, for which she is better known.&lt;ref name=crsamuelson/&gt; Her first professorship was with San Diego State University from 1997 to 2004, teaching Mexican history.&lt;ref name=crsamuelson/&gt;&lt;ref name=epdlp&gt;{{cite web  |title= Cristina Rivera Garza (México, 1964) |publisher= El Poder de la Palabra  |url= http://www.epdlp.com/escritor.php?id=2526|accessdate=November 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 CECUT/Centro Cultural de Tijuana invited her to teach a class in creative writing, which she says changed her “personal dynamics, a lot of my relationships with Mexico” being in a Spanish dominant academic environment again.&lt;ref name=crsamuelson/&gt;

In 2004, she returned to Mexico as a professor of humanities at Tec de Monterrey, Campus Toluca, where she was co-director.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=writersorg/&gt;&lt;ref name=crsamuelson/&gt; In 2008, she returned to San Diego as a professor of creative writing at the literature department of the University of California, San Diego.&lt;ref name=writersorg/&gt;

She has also taught at UNAM, [[UAEM|Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México (UAEM)]], [[DePauw University]],&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; and has done research into popular conceptions of insanity and the history of psychiatry in Mexico. Her research work has appeared in journals such as Hispanic American Historical Review, the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, as well as journals in England and Argentina.&lt;ref name=writersorg/&gt;

==Writing career==
[[File:TaigaCCM05.JPG|thumb|Rivera presenting the book ''El Mal de la Taiga'' at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City|Tec de Monterrey, Mexico City]] ]]
She is one of Mexico’s most prolific writers of her generation,&lt;ref name=bkeizman/&gt; receiving grants from CME (1984), [[FONCA]] (1994, 1999), and the Centro de Estudios México-Estados Unidos (1998).&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; In addition to writing books, she has collaborated with publications such as El Cuento, El Sol de Toluca, [[Excélsior]], La Guillotina, La Palabra y El Hombre, Macrópolis, Nacional, Punto de Partida, Revista de la UAEM and San Quintin.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;

Rivera Garza has also explored the digital realm as a venue for the publication of creative works. This began with blogging, starting with a now defunct site called ''Blogsívela'', a novel/blog written with the participation of readers.&lt;ref name=bkeizman/&gt;  She has blogged since the late nineties with her current blog dating from 2004. However, instead of using her blog solely for promotional purpose like most other writers, Rivera Garza uses the resource to publish material that is more experimental and unconstrained by the requirements of traditional publishing.&lt;ref name=bkeizman/&gt; She has also experimented with Twitter (@riveragarza), with her tweets described as developing meta commentaries both on tweeting and on literature, stating “Look at it this way: an article is three or four tweets surrounded by text.” She coined the term “tweetnovel” (tuitnovela in Spanish)  as a timeline written by the characters. Various people participate in the creative but there is someone responsible for the timeline.&lt;ref name=epaz&gt;{{cite journal |author= Edmundo Paz Soldán |title= "Cristina Rivera Garza’s Tweets." Hybrid Storyspaces:Redefining the Critical Enterprise in Twenty-First Century Hispanic Literature.  |journal= Hispanic Issues On Line 9  |date=Spring 2012 |pages=38–39 |url=http://hispanicissues.umn.edu/assets/doc/03_PAZ_SOLDAN.pdf |accessdate=November 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and style==
Rivera Garza’s works have been described as a “disturbing pleasure.”&lt;ref name=elmal&gt;{{cite news  |title= El mal de la taiga rima con desamor |newspaper= El  Informador |location=Guadalajara |date=December 4, 2012 |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/cultura/2012/421911/6/el-mal-de-la-taiga-rima-con-desamor.htm  |accessdate=November 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a writer, she aims to darken thing and make readers suspicious, believing that “there is too much light and clarity in the world” as well as too much communication and messaging. She does not write to create stories, nor to express herself or convince her readers to her point of view. Instead she believes she is producing a kind of reality, agreeing with poet [[Caridad Ascensio]] that books provide travel through a state of mind.&lt;ref name=jlherrera/&gt;  She does not believe the purpose of fiction is to inform, as there are other ways to do this, but rather she views writing as a physical manifestation of thinking. Rivera Garza believes that literature is one of the few ways people can explore the limits of human experience through language, stating that the books that have impacted her the most are those that made her think.&lt;ref name=crsamuelson/&gt;&lt;ref name=jlherrera/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmateos/&gt;

Most of her creative work is a hybrid of styles, genres and elements. She mixes styles such as narrative, poetry, short story and novel.&lt;ref name=crsamuelson/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcricalde/&gt; She blends elements from her imagination, along with those of reality including historical documents and even included herself in one of her novels.&lt;ref name=bkeizman/&gt; Her work has often focuses on those marginalized, such as insane people and prostitutes and challenges the idea that concepts such as sex, nation or narrative identity are stable.&lt;ref name=crsamuelson/&gt; Several of her works are influenced by her experience on both sides of the border, primarily writing in Spanish but has written in English as well.&lt;ref name=crsamuelson/&gt;&lt;ref name=epdlp/&gt;

==Recognition==
Rivera Garza is one of Mexico’s best-known writers,&lt;ref name=elmal/&gt; having won six of Mexico’s highest literary awards.&lt;ref name=epdlp/&gt; [[Jorge Volpi]] has named her his favorite writer.&lt;ref name=mcricalde/&gt; Her work, especially “Nadie me verá llorar” has been praised by critics, such as [[Carlos Fuentes]], who stated that it has not received the attention that it deserves.&lt;ref name=mcricalde/&gt;&lt;ref name=cfuentes&gt;{{cite news |author=Carlos Fuentes |title= Cristina Rivera Garza: Una revelacion |newspaper= Reforma |location=Mexico City   |date= December 9, 2002 |page=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work has earned her various forms of recognition starting in the 1980s with the Punto de Partida Poetry Competition in 1984 for ''Apuntes'' and the [[San Luis Potosí]] National Short Story Prize in 1987 for ''La guerra no importa''.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=writersorg/&gt; In the 1990s her first novel, “Desconocer” was a finalist at the 1994 [[Juan Rulfo Prize]] .&lt;ref name=mcricalde/&gt;

In 2001 she won the Juan Vicente Melo National Short Story Award, and was chosen as a member of the SNCA from 2003 to 2005.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcricalde/&gt;

Her first international award was the Anna Seghers International Prize, awarded in Berlin in 2005.&lt;ref name=jlherrera/&gt;

'''Domenico Losurdo''' (14 November 1941 – 28 June 2018) was an Italian [[Marxist]] philosopher and historian.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Sannicandro di Bari]], Losurdo obtained his doctorate in 1963 from the [[University of Urbino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienzeformaz.urbino.com/Prodotti/SchedaProdotto.asp?PathID=329.402&amp;IDDB=1&amp;Lan=IT|title=Losurdo Domenico|publisher=Università degli studi di Urbino « Carlo Bo »|language=Italian|accessdate=22 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717173427/http://www.scienzeformaz.urbino.com/Prodotti/SchedaProdotto.asp?PathID=329.402&amp;IDDB=1&amp;Lan=IT|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of Urbino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniurb.it/it/portale/index.php?mist_id=12000&amp;lang=ENG&amp;tipo=ENG&amp;page=1070|title=Faculties: Faculty of Education|publisher=University of Urbino|accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical work ==
Losurdo criticised the concept of [[totalitarianism]], especially in the works of [[Hannah Arendt]]. He argued that totalitarianism is a polysemic concept with origins in [[Christian theology]] and that applying it to the political sphere requires an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place [[fascist]] regimes and the [[Soviet Union]] in the dock together, serving the [[anti-communism]] of [[Cold War]]-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research.

Losurdo wrote ''[[Liberalism: A Counter-History]]'', which is highly critical of the European intellectual tradition of [[liberalism]]. He argues that liberalism, which purports to emphasize the importance of individual liberty, has long been marked by its exclusion of people from these rights, resulting in [[racism]], [[slavery]] and [[genocide]].

Losurdo asserted that the origins of fascism and [[Nazism]] are to be found in what he views as [[colonialist]] and [[imperialist]] policies of the West. He examined the intellectual and political positions of intellectuals on [[modernity]]. In his view, [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] were the greatest thinkers of modernity while [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was its greatest critic.

Losurdo died on 28 June 2018 at the age of 76.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ilpartitocomunistaitaliano.it/2018/06/28/pci-ancona-cordoglio-per-la-scomparsa-del-compagno-losurdo/|title=PCI Ancona: cordoglio per la scomparsa del Compagno Losurdo|website=ilpartitocomuistaitaliano.it|language=Italian|date=28 June 2018|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eduardo Neumann Gandía''' (1852 &amp;ndash; 1913), was one of [[Puerto Rico]]'s most accomplished  [[historian]]s.  He is particularly best known for his nineteenth century ''Verdadera y auténtica historia de la ciudad de Ponce desde sus primitivos tiempos hasta la época contemporánea''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL2243453M/Verdadera-y-auténtica-historia-de-la-ciudad-de-Ponce ''Verdadera y auténtica historia de la ciudad de Ponce desde sus primitivos tiempos hasta la época contemporánea.''] Open Library. Accessed 18 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Guillermo Neumann]], who was mayor of Ponce from 23 April 1851 to September 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Socorro Giron. ''Ponce, el teatro La Perla y La Campana de la Almudaina.'' Ponce Municipal Government. 1992. p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], but died in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], his "beloved city."&lt;ref&gt;On the Foreword to his book ''Verdadera y Auténtica Historia de la Ciudad de Ponce: Desde sus Primitivos tiempos hasta la Epoca Contemporanea'', Neumann dedicated the book to the city of Ponce and wrote "...I consider myself more ''Ponceño'' ('Poncean', or a person from Ponce) than others. Yes, I love Ponce, with all the love that fits in a sincere and altruistic heart...To you, my beloved town, I dedicate these pages that tell your history, and to you I pay today, like yesterday, and will tomorrow, like always, pure and loving homage." (September 1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Neumann Gandía distinguished himself as an essayist and teacher, as well as an accomplished historian and prolific writer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edicionesdigitales.info/biblioteca/historiaponce.pdf ''Verdadera y Auténtica Historia de la Ciudad de Ponce: Desde sus Primitivos tiempos hasta la Epoca Contemporanea.''] www.edicionesdigitales.info.  Work by Eduardo Neumann Gandía. September 1911. (Originally printed in April 1913 at Ponce, Puerto Rico.) Reprinted by [[Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña]]. San Juan, Puerto Rico. 1987. page 13. Page Number: Foreword by Guillermo Baralt, March 1987. Accessed 17 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known of his books is his 1913 ''"Verdadera y auténtica historia de la ciudad de Ponce desde sus primitivos tiempos hasta la época contemporánea"'' (True and Authentic History of the City of Ponce, from its primitive times to the contemporary age), a comprehensive and detailed history of the city of Ponce covering over 250 years, from 1646 to 1911. Neumman was also a prolific art collector. He had particularly keen interest in Taino and Antillean pottery in Puerto Rico.  Part of his "Bird-Effigy" bowl collection was acquired by Jesse Walter Fewkes in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-4NAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA185 ''The Aborigines of Porto Rico and Neighboring Islands.''] Jesse Walter Fewkes. 25th Annual Report to the U.S. Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1903-04. 1907. p.185. US Govt Printing Office. Accessed 18 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and recognitions==
In San Juan there is a public housing development also named after him.  There is a middle school in Ponce honoring his memory and contributions. He is also recognized at Ponce's [[Tricentennial Park (Ponce, Puerto Rico)|Park of Illustrious Ponce Citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelponce.com/History.html ''Tricentennial Park: History.''] TravelPonce.

'''Eusebius of Caesarea''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|s|iː|b|i|ə|s|}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Εὐσέβιος τῆς Καισαρείας}}, ''Eusébios tés Kaisareías''; {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;260/265&amp;nbsp;– 339/340), also known as '''Eusebius Pamphili''' (from the {{lang-grc-gre|Εὐσέβιος τοῦ Παμϕίλου)}}, was a [[historian of Christianity]], [[exegete]], and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[polemicist]]. He became the [[bishop]] of [[Caesarea Maritima]] about 314 AD. Together with [[Pamphilus of Caesarea|Pamphilus]], he was a scholar of the [[Biblical canon]] and is regarded as an extremely learned Christian of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=González|first=Justo|authorlink=Justo L. González|title=The Story of Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZO-lwEACAAJ|accessdate=17 May 2013|year=1984|publisher=Prince Press|isbn=978-1-56563-522-7|page=129|chapter=14 – Official Theology: Eusebius of Caesarea}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''Demonstrations of the Gospel'', ''Preparations for the Gospel'', and ''On Discrepancies between the Gospels'', studies of the Biblical text. As "Father of [[Church history|Church History]]" (not to be confused with the title of Church Father), he produced the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', ''On the Life of Pamphilus'', the ''Chronicle'' and ''On the Martyrs''.

During the Council of [[Antioch]]ia (325) he was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] for subscribing to the [[Arianism|heresy of Arius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cita web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/eusebio-di-cesarea/|title= Eusebius of Cesarea in the Treccani Encyclopedia online|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus withdrawn during the [[First Council of Nicaea]] where he accepted that the [[Homoousion]] referred to the [[Logos]]. Never recognized as a saint, he became counselor of [[Constantine the Great]], and with the bishop of [[Nicomedia]] he continued to polemicize against Saint [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], [[Church Fathers]], since he was condemned in the [[First Council of Tyre]] in 335.

==Sources==

Little is known about the life of Eusebius. His successor at the [[Episcopal see|See]] of Caesarea, [[Acacius of Caesarea|Acacius]], wrote a ''Life of Eusebius'', a work that has since been lost. Eusebius' own surviving works probably only represent a small portion of his total output.  Beyond notices in his extant writings, the major sources are the 5th-century ecclesiastical historians [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates]], [[Sozomen]], and [[Theodoret]], and the 4th-century Christian author [[Jerome]]. There are assorted notices of his activities in the writings of his contemporaries [[Athanasius]], [[Arius]], [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]], and [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]]. Eusebius' pupil, [[Eusebius of Emesa]], provides some incidental information.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace-Hadrill, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
In his ''Ecclesiastical History'', Eusebius writes of [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius of Alexandria]] as his contemporary. If this is true, Eusebius' birth must have been before Dionysius' death in autumn 264; most modern scholars date the birth to some point in the five years between 260 and 265.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 277; Wallace-Hadrill, 7; Quasten dates his birth to "about 263" (3.309).&lt;/ref&gt; He was presumably born in the town in which he lived for most of his adult life, [[Caesarea Maritima]].&lt;ref&gt;Louth, "Birth of church history", 266; Quasten, 3.309.&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptized and instructed in the city,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wallace-Hadrill, 12, citing Socrates, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 1.8; Theodoret, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 1.11.&lt;/ref&gt; and lived in Palestine in 296, when [[Diocletian]]'s army passed through the region (in the ''Life of Constantine'', Eusebius recalls seeing [[Constantine I|Constantine]] traveling with the army).&lt;ref&gt;Wallace-Hadrill, 12, citing ''Vita Constantini'' 1.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius was made [[presbyter]] by [[Agapius of Caesarea]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some, like theologian and ecclesiastical historian [[John Henry Newman]], understand Eusebius' statement that he had heard [[Dorotheus of Tyre]] "expound the Scriptures wisely in the Church" to indicate that Eusebius was Dorotheus' pupil while the priest was resident in Antioch; others, like the scholar D. S. Wallace-Hadrill, deem the phrase too ambiguous to support the contention.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Ecclesiastical History'' 7.32.4, qtd. and tr. D. S. Wallace-Hadrill, 12; Wallace-Hadrill cites J. H. Newman, ''The Arians of the Fourth Century'' (1890), 262, in 12 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 3rd century, Caesarea had a population of about 100,000. It had been a pagan city since [[Pompey]] had given control of the city to the [[gentile]]s during his command of the eastern provinces in the 60s BC. The gentiles retained control of the city for the three centuries to follow, despite Jewish petitions for joint governorship. Gentile government was strengthened by the city's refoundation under [[Herod the Great]] (r.&amp;nbsp;37–4&amp;nbsp;BC), when it had taken on the name of [[Augustus|Augustus Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 81–82; cf. also A. H. M. Jones, ''The Cities of the Eastern Roman Provinces'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1937), 273–74.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the gentile settlers, Caesarea had large Jewish and Samaritan minorities. Eusebius was probably born into the Christian contingent of the city. Caesarea's Christian community presumably had a history reaching back to [[Apostolic Age|apostolic times]],&lt;ref&gt;Acts 8:40, 10:1–48; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 82, 327 n. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is a common claim that no bishops are attested for the town before about 190,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 82.&lt;/ref&gt; even though the [[Apostolic Constitutions]] 7.46 states that [[Zacchaeus]] was the first bishop.

Through the activities of the theologian [[Origen]] (185/6–254) and the school of his follower [[Pamphilus of Caesarea|Pamphilus]] (later 3rd century – 309), Caesarea became a center of Christian learning. Origen was largely responsible for the collection of usage information, or which churches were using which gospels, regarding the texts which became the [[New Testament]]. The information used to create the late-fourth-century [[Easter Letter]], which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the [[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]] [HE] of Eusebius of Caesarea, wherein he uses the information passed on to him by Origen to create both his list at HE 3:25 and Origen's list at HE 6:25. Eusebius got his information about what texts were accepted by the third-century churches throughout the known world, a great deal of which Origen knew of firsthand from his extensive travels, from the library and writings of Origen.&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Bateman, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1653073 Origen’s Role in the Formation of the New Testament Canon], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his deathbed, Origen had made a bequest of his private library to the Christian community in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Quasten, 3.309.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the books of his patron Ambrosius, Origen's library (including the original manuscripts of his works&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.32.3–4; Kofsky, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Pamphilus might not have obtained all of Origen's writings, however: the library's text of Origen's commentary on Isaiah broke off at 30:6, while the original commentary was said to have taken up thirty volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 333 n. 114, citing Eusebius, ''HE'' 6.32.1; ''In Is''. p. 195.20–21 Ziegler.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}) formed the core of the collection that Pamphilus established.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 6.32.3–4; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 93; idem., "Eusebius of Caesarea", 2 col. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Pamphilus also managed a school that was similar to (or perhaps a re-establishment of&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 124–25.&lt;/ref&gt;) that of Origen.&lt;ref&gt;Kofsky, 12, citing Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 7.32.25. On Origen's school, see: Gregory, ''Oratio Panegyrica''; Kofsky, 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Pamphilus was compared to [[Demetrius of Phalerum]] and [[Peisistratos|Pisistratus]], for he had gathered Bibles "from all parts of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his model Origen, Pamphilus maintained close contact with his students. Eusebius, in his history of the persecutions, alludes to the fact that many of the Caesarean martyrs lived together, presumably under Pamphilus.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Pamphilus settled in Caesarea (''ca''. 280s), he began teaching Eusebius, who was then somewhere between twenty and twenty-five.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his close relationship with his schoolmaster, Eusebius was sometimes called ''Eusebius Pamphili'': "Eusebius, son of Pamphilus".{{refn|There are three interpretations of this term: (1) that Eusebius was the "spiritual son", or favored pupil, of Pamphilus;&lt;ref&gt;Quasten, 3.310.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) that Eusebius was literally adopted by Pamphilus;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and (3) that Eusebius was Pamphilus' biological son. The third explanation is the least popular among scholars. The scholion on the ''Preparation for the Gospels'' 1.3 in the ''Codex Paris''. 451 is usually adduced in support of the thesis. Most reject the scholion as too late or misinformed, but E. H. Gifford, an editor and translator of the ''Preparation'', believes it to have been written by [[Arethas of Caesarea|Arethas]], the tenth-century archbishop of Caesarea, who was in a position to know the truth of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace-Hadrill, 12 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} The name may also indicate that Eusebius was made Pamphilus' heir.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace-Hadrill, 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Pamphilus gave Eusebius a strong admiration for the thought of Origen.&lt;ref&gt;Quasten, 3.309–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Pamphilus nor Eusebius knew Origen personally;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 93, 95; Louth, "Birth of church history", 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Pamphilus probably picked up Origenist ideas during his studies under [[Pierius]] (nicknamed "Origen Junior"&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''de Viris Illustribus'' 76, qtd. and tr. Louth, "Birth of church history", 266.&lt;/ref&gt;) in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 93, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; In Caesarea, Origenist thought was continued in the generation after his death by [[Theotecnus]], bishop of the city for much of the late 3rd century and an alumnus of Origen's school.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eusebius' ''Preparation for the Gospel'' bears witness to the literary tastes of Origen: Eusebius quotes no comedy, tragedy, or lyric poetry, but makes reference to all the works of [[Plato]] and to an extensive range of later philosophic works, largely from [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonists]] from [[Philo]] to the late 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever its secular contents, the primary aim of Origen and Pamphilus' school was to promote sacred learning. The library's biblical and theological contents were more impressive: Origen's [[Hexapla]] and [[Tetrapla]]; a copy of the original Aramaic version of the [[Gospel of Matthew]]; and many of Origen's own writings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Marginal comments in extant manuscripts note that Pamphilus and his friends and pupils, including Eusebius, corrected and revised much of the biblical text in their library.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Their efforts made the hexaplaric Septuagint text increasingly popular in Syria and Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after joining Pamphilus' school, Eusebius started helping his master expand the library's collections and broaden access to its resources. At about this time Eusebius compiled a ''Collection of Ancient Martyrdoms'', presumably for use as a general reference tool.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In the 290s, Eusebius began work on his ''magnum opus'', the ''Ecclesiastical History'', a narrative history of the Church and Christian community from the [[Apostolic Age]] to Eusebius' own time. At about the same time, he worked on his ''Chronicle'', a universal calendar of events from the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] to, again, Eusebius' own time. He completed the first editions of the ''Ecclesiastical History'' and ''Chronicle'' before 300.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 277; Wallace-Hadrill, 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishop of Caesarea==
Eusebius succeeded [[Agapius of Caesarea|Agapius]] as Bishop of Caesarea soon after 313  and was called on by [[Arius]] who had been excommunicated by his bishop [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]]. An episcopal council in Caesarea pronounced Arius blameless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vermes|first=Geza|title=Christian Beginnings from Nazareth to Nicea|accessdate=Feb 4, 2016|date=2012|publisher=Allen Lane the Penguin Press|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius, a learned man and famous author, enjoyed the favour of the [[Emperor Constantine]]. Because of this he was called upon to present the [[creed]] of his own church to the 318 attendees of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walker |first=Williston |title=A History of the Christian Church |year=1959 |publisher=T&amp;T Clark |location= Edinburgh |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the anti-Arian creed from Palestine prevailed becoming the basis for the [[Nicene Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce L. Shelley, ''Church History in Plain Language,'' (2nd ed. Dallas, Texas: Word Publishing, 1995.), p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theological views of Arius, that taught the subordination of the Son to the Father, continued to be a problem. [[Eustathius of Antioch]] strongly opposed the growing influence of [[Origen|Origen's]] theology as the root of [[Arianism]]. Eusebius, an admirer of Origen, was reproached by Eustathius for deviating from the Nicene faith. Eusebius prevailed and Eustathius was deposed at a [[synod]] in [[Antioch]].

However, [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] became a more powerful opponent and in 334, he was summoned before a synod in Caesarea (which he refused to attend). In the following year, he was again summoned before a [[First Synod of Tyre|synod in Tyre]] at which Eusebius of Caesarea presided. Athanasius, foreseeing the result, went to [[Constantinople]] to bring his cause before the Emperor. Constantine called the bishops to his court, among them Eusebius. Athanasius was condemned and exiled at the end of 335. Eusebius remained in the Emperor's favour throughout this time and more than once was exonerated with the explicit approval of the Emperor Constantine. After the Emperor's death (c.337), Eusebius wrote the [[Life of Constantine]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KchhO8KEy3cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Life+of+Constantine%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Life of Constantine'', Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; an important historical work because of eye witness accounts and the use of primary sources. Eusebius died c.339.&lt;ref&gt;Colm Luibheid, ''The Essential Eusebius : The Story of the First Centuries of the Christian Church in the Words of Its Greatest Historian'', Mentor-Omega Press, 1966, p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Much like his birth, the exact date of Eusebius' death is unknown. However, there is primary text evidence from a council held in Antioch that by the year 341, his successor Acacius had already filled the seat as Bishop. [[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates]] and Sozomen write about Eusebius' death, and place it just before Constantine's son [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] died, which was in early 340. They also say that it was after the second banishment of Athanasius, which began in mid 339. This means that his death occurred some time between the second half of 339 and early 340.&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip and Rev. Arthur Cushman McGiffert, Ph.D. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine. Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library, (1890). 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Armenian translation of Eusebius Chronicon.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Armenian translation of Chronicon. 13th century manuscript]]
Of the extensive literary activity of Eusebius, a relatively large portion has been preserved. Although posterity suspected him of [[Arianism]], Eusebius had made himself indispensable by his method of authorship; his comprehensive and careful excerpts from original sources saved his successors the painstaking labor of original research. Hence, much has been preserved, quoted by Eusebius, which otherwise would have been lost.

The literary productions of Eusebius reflect on the whole the course of his life. At first, he occupied himself with works on Biblical criticism under the influence of [[Pamphilus of Caesarea|Pamphilus]] and probably of [[Dorotheus of Tyre]] of the [[School of Antioch]]. Afterward, the persecutions under [[Diocletian]] and [[Galerius]] directed his attention to the martyrs of his own time and the past, and this led him to the history of the whole Church and finally to the history of the world, which, to him, was only a preparation for ecclesiastical history.

Then followed the time of the Arian controversies, and [[dogma]]tic questions came into the foreground. Christianity at last found recognition by the State; and this brought new problems—apologies of a different sort had to be prepared. Lastly, Eusebius wrote eulogies in praise of Constantine. To all this activity must be added numerous writings of a miscellaneous nature, addresses, letters, and the like, and exegetical works that extended over the whole of his life and that include both commentaries and treatises on [[Biblical archaeology]].

===''Onomasticon''===
Eusebius' ''Onomasticon'' (more properly, ''On the Place-Names in the Holy Scripture'', {{lang|grc|Περὶ τῶν τοπικῶν ὀνομάτων τῶν ἐν τῇ Θείᾳ Γραφῇ}}) is a directory of place names, or "[[gazetteer]]", a primary source that provides [[Historical geography|historical geographers]] with a contemporary knowledge of 4th-century [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]]. It sits uneasily between the ancient genres of geography and lexicography, taking elements from both but a member of neither.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 106.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Eusebius' description of his own method, who wrote: "I shall collect the entries from the whole of the divinely inspired Scriptures, and I shall set them out grouped by their initial letters so that one may easily perceive what lies scattered throughout the text,"&lt;ref&gt;''Onomasticon'' p. 2.14ff., qtd. and tr. Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 107.&lt;/ref&gt; implies that he had no similar type of book to work from; his work being entirely original, based only on the text of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 106–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have suggested that Eusebius had at his disposal early Roman maps of the Roman Empire with which to work, and which allowed him to record the precise distances between locations in Roman miles.&lt;ref&gt;Yoel Elitzur, ''Ancient Toponyms in Eretz-Israel as Preserved among the Arabs - The Linguistic Aspects'', Hebrew University: Jerusalem 1992, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, this innovation has been very useful to modern research. Of the approximate 980 Biblical and N.T. names of places contained in those works, Eusebius identifies some 340 with locations known in his own day and age. 

Eusebius organizes his entries into separate categories according to their first letters. The entries for [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] under [[Tau]], for example, read as follows:&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 107.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Tina (Kinah, 15:22): of the tribe of Judah.&lt;br&gt;
Telem (15:24): of the tribe of Judah.&lt;br&gt;
Tessam ([Azem] 15:29): of the tribe of Judah.&lt;br&gt;
Tyre ([Zer] 19:35): of the tribe of Naphthali.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under each letter, the entries are organized first by the book they are found in, and then by their place in that book. In almost all of the entries in his geographical opus, Eusebius brings down the respective distances in Roman "[[milestone]]s" (''semeia'') from major points of reference, such as from [[Jerusalem]], [[Beit Guvrin, Israel|Beit Gubrin]] (Eleutheropolis), [[Hebron]], [[Ptolemais Akko|Ptolemais]], [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], etc. In Eusebius' ''Onomasticon'', distances between each "milestone" were usually 1,600 meters–1,700 meters, although the standard Roman mile was 1,475 meters. Since most villages in the ''Onomasticon'' are far removed from Roman-built roads, scholars have concluded that Eusebius did not glean the geographical information from maps based on a milestone survey, but rather collected the information from some other source.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isaac and Israel Roll, ''Roman Roads in Judaea I – The Legio-Scythopolis Road'', [[British Archaeological Reports|B.A.R.]] International Series, Oxford 1982, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is a contemporary town at the site or nearby, Eusebius notes it in the corresponding entry. "[[Pistacia palaestina|Terebinth]]", for example, describes [[Shechem]] as "near Neapolis", modern [[Nablus]], and "[[Tophet]]" is located "in the suburbs of Jerusalem".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

====Date====
The ''Onomasticon'' has traditionally been dated before 324, on the basis of its sparse references to Christianity, and complete absence of remarks on Constantine's buildings in the Holy Land. The work also describes traditional religious practices at the oak of [[Mamre]] as though they were still happening, while they are known to have been suppressed soon after 325, when a church was built on the site.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, "Onomasticon", 413.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius references to the encampment of the [[Legio X Fretensis]] at Aila (in southern Israel, near modern [[Aqaba]] and [[Eilat]]); the X Fretensis was probably transferred from Jerusalem to Aila under Diocletian.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, "Onomasticon", 413 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Language====
Eusebius compiled his work in [[Greek language|Greek]], although a Latin translation of the Onomasticon was made by [[Jerome]] about a century later.

Pamphilus and Eusebius occupied themselves with the [[textual criticism]] of the [[Septuagint]] text of the [[Old Testament]] and especially of the [[New Testament]]. An edition of the Septuagint seems to have been already prepared by [[Origen]], which, according to [[Jerome]], was revised and circulated by Eusebius and Pamphilus. For an easier survey of the material of the four Evangelists, Eusebius divided his edition of the New Testament into paragraphs and provided it with a synoptical table so that it might be easier to find the [[pericope]]s that belong together. These [[canon tables]] or "Eusebian canons" remained in use throughout the Middle Ages, and [[illuminated manuscript]] versions are important for the study of early medieval art, as they are the most elaborately decorated pages of many [[Gospel book]]s. Eusebius detailed in ''[[Epistula ad Carpianum]]'' how to use his canons.

===''Chronicle''===
{{Main|Chronicon (Eusebius)}}
The ''Chronicle'' ({{lang|grc|Παντοδαπὴ Ἱστορία}} (''Pantodape historia'')) is divided into two parts. The first part, the ''Chronography'' ({{lang|grc|Χρονογραφία}} (''Chronographia'')), gives an epitome of universal history from the sources, arranged according to nations. The second part, the ''Canons'' ({{lang|grc|Χρονικοὶ Κανόνες}} (''Chronikoi kanones'')), furnishes a synchronism of the historical material in parallel columns, the equivalent of a parallel timeline.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work as a whole has been lost in the original Greek, but it may be reconstructed from later chronographists of the Byzantine school who made excerpts from the work, especially [[George Syncellus]]. The tables of the second part have been completely preserved in a Latin translation by Jerome, and both parts are still extant in an [[Armenian language|Armenian]] translation. The loss of the Greek originals has given an Armenian translation a special importance; thus, the first part of Eusebius' ''Chronicle'', of which only a few fragments exist in the Greek, has been preserved entirely in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], though with lacunae. The ''Chronicle'' as preserved extends to the year 325.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 112–13, 340 n. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Church History''===
{{Main|Church History (Eusebius)}}
In his ''Church History'' or ''Ecclesiastical History'', Eusebius wrote the first surviving history of the Christian Church as a chronologically-ordered account, based on earlier sources, complete from the period of the Apostles to his own epoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Glenn F. | last = Chesnut | title = The First Christian Histories: Eusebius, Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, and Evagrius | year = 1986 | chapter = Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time scheme correlated the history with the reigns of the Roman Emperors, and the scope was broad. Included were the bishops and other teachers of the Church, Christian relations with the Jews and those deemed heretical, and the Christian martyrs through 324.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Paul L. | last = Maier | title = Eusebius: The Church History – Translation and Commentary by Paul L. Maier | year = 2007 | page = 9 and 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its accuracy and biases have been questioned,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[James the Brother of Jesus (book)]] by Robert Eisenman.&lt;/ref&gt; it remains an important source on the early church due to Eusebius's access to materials now lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07365a.htm | title = Catholic Encyclopedia | contribution = Ecclesiastical History | publisher = New Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Life of Constantine''===
Eusebius' ''[[Life of Constantine]]'' (''Vita Constantini'') is a [[eulogy]] or [[panegyric]], and therefore its style and selection of facts are affected by its purpose, rendering it inadequate as a continuation of the ''Church History.'' As the historian [[Socrates Scholasticus]] said, at the opening of his history which was designed as a continuation of Eusebius, "Also in writing the life of Constantine, this same author has but slightly treated of matters regarding [[Arius]], being more intent on the rhetorical finish of his composition and the praises of the emperor, than on an accurate statement of facts." The work was unfinished at Eusebius' death. Some scholars have questioned the Eusebian authorship of this work.

===Minor historical works===
Before he compiled his church history, Eusebius edited a collection of martyrdoms of the earlier period and a biography of Pamphilus. The martyrology has not survived as a whole, but it has been preserved almost completely in parts. It contained:

*an epistle of the congregation of [[Smyrna]] concerning the martyrdom of [[Polycarp]];
*the martyrdom of [[Pionius]];
*the martyrdoms of [[Carpus and Papylus|Carpus, Papylus]], and [[Carpus and Papylus|Agathonike]];
*the martyrdoms in the congregations of [[Vienne]] and [[Lyon]];
*the martyrdom of Apollonius.

Of the life of Pamphilus, only a fragment survives. A work on the [[martyrs of Palestine]] in the time of Diocletian was composed after 311; numerous fragments are scattered in legendaries which have yet to be collected. The life of Constantine was compiled after the death of the emperor and the election of his sons as Augusti (337). It is more a rhetorical eulogy on the emperor than a history but is of great value on account of numerous documents incorporated in it.

===Apologetic and dogmatic works===
To the class of [[Apologetics|apologetic]] and dogmatic works belong:

* The ''[[Apology for Origen]]'', the first five books of which, according to the definite statement of Photius, were written by Pamphilus in prison, with the assistance of Eusebius. Eusebius added the sixth book after the death of Pamphilus. We possess only a Latin translation of the first book, made by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]];
* A treatise against [[Sossianus Hierocles|Hierocles]] (a Roman governor), in which Eusebius combated the former's glorification of [[Apollonius of Tyana]] in a work entitled ''[[A Truth-loving Discourse]]'' (Greek: ''Philalethes logos''); in spite of manuscript attribution to Eusebius, however, it has been argued (by Thomas Hagg&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hagg, "Hierocles the Lover of Truth and Eusebius the Sophist," SO 67 (1992): 138–50&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, Aaron Johnson&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Johnson, "The Author of the Against Hierocles: A Response to Borzì and Jones," JTS 64 (2013): 574–594)&lt;/ref&gt; that this treatise "[[Against Hierocles]]" was written by someone other than Eusebius of Caesarea.
* ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' (''Preparation for the Gospel''), commonly known by its Latin title, which attempts to prove the excellence of Christianity over every pagan religion and philosophy. The ''Praeparatio'' consists of fifteen books which have been completely preserved. Eusebius considered it an introduction to Christianity for pagans. But its value for many later readers is more because Eusebius studded this work with so many lively fragments from historians and philosophers which are nowhere else preserved. Here alone is preserved a summary of the writings of the [[Phoenicia]]n priest [[Sanchuniathon]] of which the accuracy has been shown by the mythological accounts found on the [[Ugaritic]] tables, here alone is the account from [[Diodorus Siculus]]'s sixth book of [[Euhemerus]]' wondrous voyage to the island of [[Panchaea]] where [[Euhemerus]] purports to have found his true history of the gods, and here almost alone is preserved writings of the [[neo-Platonist]] philosopher [[Atticus (philosopher)|Atticus]] along with so much else.
* ''Demonstratio evangelica'' (''[[Proof of the Gospel]]'') is closely connected to the ''Praeparatio'' and comprised originally twenty books of which ten have been completely preserved as well as a fragment of the fifteenth. Here Eusebius treats of the person of Jesus Christ. The work was probably finished before 311;
* Another work which originated in the time of the persecution, entitled ''[[Prophetic Extracts]]'' (''Eclogae propheticae''). It discusses in four books the [[Messiah|Messianic]] texts of Scripture. The work is merely the surviving portion (books 6–9) of the ''General elementary introduction'' to the Christian faith, now lost.  The fragments given as the Commentary on Luke in the PG have been claimed to derive from the missing tenth book of the General Elementary Introduction see D. S. Wallace-Hadrill); however, Aaron Johnson has argued that they cannot be associated with this work.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Johnson, "The Tenth Book of Eusebius' General Elementary Introduction: A Critique of the Wallace-Hadrill Thesis," Journal of Theological Studies, 62.1 (2011): 144–160&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|On Divine Manifestation|Theophania}}&lt;!--linked--&gt;
* The treatise ''On Divine Manifestation'' or ''On the Theophania'' (''Peri theophaneias''), of unknown date. It treats of the incarnation of the Divine [[Logos]], and its contents are in many cases identical with the ''Demonstratio evangelica.'' Only fragments are preserved in Greek, but a complete Syriac translation of the ''Theophania'' survives in an early 5th-century manuscript. Samuel Lee, the editor (1842) and translator (1843) of the Syriac ''Theophania'' thought that the work must have been written "after the general peace restored to the Church by Constantine, and before either the 'Praeparatio,' or the 'Demonstratio Evengelica,' was written . . . it appears probable . . . therefore, that this was one of the first productions of Eusebius, if not the first after the persecutions ceased."&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea ''On the Theophania, or Divine Manifestation of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ'' (Cambridge, 1843), pp. xxi–xxii. Lee's full passage is as follows: "As to the period at which it was written, I think it must have been, after the general peace restored to the Church by Constantine, and before either the "Praeparatio", or the "Demonstratio Evangelica", was written. My reason for the first of these suppositions is: Our author speaks repeatedly of the peace restored to the Church; of Churches and Schools restored, or then built for the first time : of the nourishing state of the Church of Caesarea; of the extended, and then successfully extending, state of Christianity : all of which could not have been said during the times of the last, and most severe persecution. My reasons for the second of these suppositions are, the considerations that whatever portions of this Work are found, either in the "Praeparatio", |22 the "Demonstratio Evangelica", or the " Oratio de laudibus Constantini", they there occur in no regular sequence of argument as they do in this Work: especially in the latter, into which they have been carried evidently for the purpose of lengthening out a speech. Besides, many of these places are amplified in these works, particularly in the two former as remarked in my notes; which seems to suggest, that such additions were made either to accommodate these to the new soil, into which they had been so transplanted, or, to supply some new matter, which had suggested itself to our author. And again, as both the "Praeparatio" and "Demonstratio Evangelica", are works which must have required very considerable time to complete them, and which would even then be unfit for general circulation ; it appears probable to me, that this more popular, and more useful work, was first composed and published, and that the other two,--illustrating as they generally do, some particular points only,--argued in order in our Work,-- were reserved for the reading and occasional writing of our author during a considerable number of years, as well for the satisfaction of his own mind, as for the general reading of the learned. It appears probable to me therefore, that this was one of the first productions of Eusebius, if not the first after the persecutions ceased."&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo Gressmann, noting in 1904 that the ''Demonstratio'' seems to be mentioned at IV. 37 and V. 1, and that II. 14 seems to mention the extant practice of temple prostitution at Hieropolis in Phoenica, concluded that the ''Theophania'' was probably written shortly after 324. Others have suggested a date as late as 337.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'' (Harvard, 1981), p. 367, n.176. Note that Lee (p. 285) thinks that the passage in V. 1 refers to an earlier section within the ''Theophania'' itself, rather than to the ''Demonstratio''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A polemical treatise against [[Marcellus of Ancyra]], the ''Against Marcellus'', dating from about 337;
* A supplement to the last-named work, also against Marcellus, entitled ''[[Ecclesiastical Theology]]'', in which he defended the Nicene doctrine of the Logos against the party of Athanasius.

A number of writings, belonging in this category, have been entirely lost.

===Exegetical and miscellaneous works===
All of the exegetical works of Eusebius have suffered damage in transmission. The majority of them are known to us only from long portions quoted in Byzantine catena-commentaries. However these portions are very extensive. Extant are:

*An enormous Commentary on the [[Psalms]].
*A commentary on [[Isaiah]], discovered more or less complete in a manuscript in Florence early in the 20th century and published 50 years later.
*Small fragments of commentaries on [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] and [[1 Corinthians]].

Eusebius also wrote a work ''Quaestiones ad Stephanum et Marinum'', "On the Differences of the Gospels" (including solutions). This was written for the purpose of harmonizing the contradictions in the reports of the different Evangelists. This work was recently (2011) translated into the English language by David J. Miller and Adam C. McCollum (edited by Roger Pearse) and was published under the name "Eusebius of Caesarea: Gospel Problems and Solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Eusebius-Caesarea-Problems-Solutions-Translation/dp/0956654010/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334377421&amp;sr=8-1# |title=Eusebius of Caesarea: Gospel Problems and Solutions (Ancient Texts in Translation): Roger Pearse, David J Miller, Adam C McCollum: 9780956654014: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original work was also translated into Syriac, and lengthy quotations exist in a ''catena'' in that language, and also in [[coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Arabic]] catenas.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Graf, ''Geschichte der christlichen arabischen Literatur'' vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Eusebius also wrote treatises on Biblical archaeology:

*A work on the Greek equivalents of Hebrew Gentilic nouns;
*A description of old Judea with an account of the loss of the ten tribes;
*A plan of Jerusalem and the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple of Solomon]].

These three treatises have been lost.

The addresses and sermons of Eusebius are mostly lost, but some have been preserved, e.g., a sermon on the consecration of the church in Tyre and an address on the thirtieth anniversary of the reign of Constantine (336).

Most of Eusebius' letters are lost. His letters to Carpianus and Flacillus exist complete. Fragments of a letter to the empress Constantia also exists.

==Doctrine==
Eusebius is fairly unusual in his [[preterist]], or fulfilled eschatological view.  Saying "The Holy Scriptures foretell that there will be unmistakable signs of the Coming of Christ. Now there were among the Hebrews three outstanding offices of dignity, which made the nation famous, firstly the kingship, secondly that of prophet, and lastly the high priesthood. The prophecies said that the abolition and complete destruction of all these three together would be the sign of the presence of the Christ. And that the proofs that the times had come, would lie in the ceasing of the Mosaic worship, the desolation of Jerusalem and its Temple, and the subjection of the whole Jewish race to its enemies...The holy oracles foretold that all these changes, which had not been made in the days of the prophets of old, would take place at the coming of the Christ, which I will presently shew to have been fulfilled as never before in accordance with the predictions." (Demonstratio Evangelica VIII)

From a [[dogma]]tic point of view, Eusebius stands entirely upon the shoulders of [[Origen]]. Like Origen, he started from the fundamental thought of the absolute sovereignty (''monarchia'') of God. God is the cause of all beings. But he is not merely a cause; in him everything good is included, from him all life originates, and he is the source of all virtue. God sent Christ into the world that it may partake of the blessings included in the essence of God. Christ is God and is a ray of the eternal light; but the figure of the ray is so limited by Eusebius that he expressly distinguishes the Son as distinct from Father as a ray is also distinct from its source the sun.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Eusebius was intent upon emphasizing the difference of the persons of the Trinity and maintaining the subordination of the Son (Logos, or Word) to God. The Logos, the Son (Jesus) is an hypostasis of God the Father whose generation, for Eusebius, took place before time. The Logos acts as the organ or instrument of God, the creator of life, the principle of every revelation of God, who in his absoluteness and transcendence is enthroned above and isolated from all the world. Eusebius, with most of the Christian tradition, assumed God was immutable. Therefore, to Eusebius's mind, the Logos must possess divinity by participation (and not originally like the Father), so that he can change, unlike God the Father. Thus he assumed a human body without altering the immutable divine Father. Eusebius never calls Jesus ''o theós'', but ''theós'' because in all contrary attempts he suspected either polytheism (three distinct gods) or [[Sabellianism]] (three modes of one divine person).

Likewise, Eusebius described the relation of the Holy Spirit within the Trinity to that of the Son to the Father. No point of this doctrine is original with Eusebius, all is traceable to his teacher Origen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The lack of originality in his thinking shows itself in the fact that he never presented his thoughts in a system. After nearly being excommunicated due to charges of heresy by Alexander of Alexandria, Eusebius submitted and agreed to the [[Nicene Creed]] at the [[First Council of Nicea]] in 325.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Eusebius held that men were sinners by their own free choice and not by the necessity of their natures. Eusebius said, "The Creator of all things has impressed a natural law upon the soul of every man, as an assistant and ally in his conduct, pointing out to him the right way by this law; but, by the free liberty with which he is endowed, making the choice of what is best worthy of praise and acceptance, because he has acted rightly, not by force, but from his own free-will, when he had it in his power to act otherwise, As, again, making him who chooses what is worst, deserving of blame and punishment, as having by his own motion neglected the natural law, and becoming the origin and fountain of wickedness, and misusing himself, not from any extraneous necessity, but from free will and judgment. The fault is in him who chooses, not in God. For God has not made nature or the substance of the soul bad; for he who is good can make nothing but what is good. Everything is good which is according to nature. Every rational soul has naturally a good free-will, formed for the choice of what is good. But when a man acts wrongly, nature is not to be blamed; for what is wrong, takes place not according to nature, but contrary to nature, it being the work of choice, and not of nature".&lt;ref&gt;The Christian Examiner, Volume One, published by James Miller, 1824 Edition, p.&amp;nbsp;66&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] several centuries later, Eusebius had unfairly gained the reputation of having been an [[Arian]], and was roundly condemned as such by Patriarch [[Nikephoros I of Constantinople]].  A letter Eusebius is supposed to have written to [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s daughter [[Constantina|Constantia]], refusing to fulfill her request for images of Christ, was quoted in the decrees (now lost) of the Iconoclast [[Council of Hieria]] in 754, and later quoted in part in the rebuttal of the Hieria decrees in the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] of 787, now the only source from which some of the text is known.  The authenticity, or authorship of the letter remain uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gwynn, "From Iconoclasm to Arianism: The Construction of Christian Tradition in the Iconoclast Controversy" [Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 225–251], p. 227-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
*[[Edward Gibbon]] openly distrusted the writings of Eusebius concerning the number of martyrs, by noting a passage in the shorter text of the ''Martyrs of Palestine'' attached to the ''Ecclesiastical History'' (Book 8, Chapter 2) in which Eusebius introduces his description of the martyrs of the Great Persecution under Diocletian with: "''Wherefore we have decided to relate nothing concerning them except the things in which we can vindicate the Divine judgment. [...] We shall introduce into this history in general only those events which may be useful first to ourselves and afterwards to posterity.''"&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', vol. 1, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; In the longer text of the same work, chapter 12, Eusebius states: "''I think it best to pass by all the other events which occurred in the meantime: such as [...] the lust of power on the part of many, the disorderly and unlawful ordinations, and the schisms among the confessors themselves; also the novelties which were zealously devised against the remnants of the Church by the new and factious members, who added innovation after innovation and forced them in unsparingly among the calamities of the persecution, heaping misfortune upon misfortune. I judge it more suitable to shun and avoid the account of these things, as I said at the beginning.''"
*When his own honesty was challenged by his contemporaries,&lt;ref&gt;See Gibbon's ''Vindication'' for examples of the accusations that he faced.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbon appealed to a chapter heading in Eusebius' ''[[Preparation for the Gospel|Praeparatio evangelica]]'' (Book XII, Chapter 31)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_12_book12.htm|title=Eusebius of Caesarea: Praeparatio Evangelica (translated by E.H. Gifford)|publisher=tertullian.org|accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Eusebius discussed "''That it will be necessary sometimes to use falsehood as a remedy for the benefit of those who require such a mode of treatment.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/eusebius/pe_data.htm|title=Data for discussing the meaning of pseudos and Eusebius in PE XII, 31|publisher=tertullian.org|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although Gibbon refers to Eusebius as the 'gravest' of the ecclesiastical historians,&lt;ref&gt;"The gravest of the ecclesiastical historians, Eusebius himself, indirectly confesses, that he has related whatever might redound to the glory, and that he has suppressed all that could tend to the disgrace, of religion." (History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol II, Chapter XVI)&lt;/ref&gt; he also suggests that Eusebius was more concerned with the passing political concerns of his time than his duty as a reliable historian.&lt;ref&gt;"Such an acknowledgment will naturally excite a suspicion that a writer who has so openly violated one of the fundamental laws of history has not paid a very strict regard to the observance of the other; and the suspicion will derive additional credit from the character of Eusebius, which was less tinctured with credulity, and more practised in the arts of courts, than that of almost any of his contemporaries." (History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Vol II, Chapter XVI)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jacob Burckhardt]] (19th century cultural historian) dismissed Eusebius as "the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity".
*Other critics of Eusebius' work cite the panegyrical tone of the ''Vita'', plus the omission of internal Christian conflicts in the ''Canones'', as reasons to interpret his writing with caution.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, R. W., and Witold Witakowski. 1999. Studies in Eusebian and Post-Eusebian chronography 1.'' The "Chronici canones" of Eusebius of Caesarea: structure, content and chronology, AD 282–325&amp;nbsp;– 2. The "Continuatio Antiochiensis Eusebii": a chronicle of Antioch and the Roman Near East during the Reigns of Constantine and Constantius II, AD 325–350.'' Historia (Wiesbaden, Germany), Heft 135. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner. Page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate views have suggested that Gibbon's dismissal of Eusebius is inappropriate:

* With reference to Gibbon's comments, [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] (late 19th century theologian and former Bishop of Durham) pointed out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/eusebius/lightfoot.htm|title=J.B. Lightfoot, Eusebius of Caesarea|publisher=tertullian.org|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Eusebius' statements indicate his honesty in stating what he was not going to discuss, and also his limitations as a historian in not including such material. He also discusses the question of accuracy. "The manner in which Eusebius deals with his very numerous quotations elsewhere, where we can test his honesty, is a sufficient vindication against this unjust charge." Lightfoot also notes that Eusebius cannot always be relied on: "A far more serious drawback to his value as a historian is the loose and uncritical spirit in which he sometimes deals with his materials. This shows itself in diverse ways. He is not always to be trusted in his discrimination of genuine and spurious documents."
*[[Averil Cameron]] (professor at King's College and Oxford) and Stuart Hall (historian and theologian), in their recent translation of the ''Life of Constantine'', point out that writers such as Burckhardt found it necessary to attack Eusebius in order to undermine the ideological legitimacy of the Habsburg empire, which based itself on the idea of Christian empire derived from Constantine, and that the most controversial letter in the ''Life'' has since been found among the papyri of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Averil Cameron, Stuart G. Hall, ''Eusebius' Life of Constantine''. Introduction, translation and commentary. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 1999. Pp. xvii + 395. {{ISBN|0-19-814924-7}}. Reviewed in [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2000/2000-08-08.html BMCR]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Church History (periodical)|Church History]]'' (Vol. 59, 1990), Michael J. Hollerich (assistant professor at the Jesuit Santa Clara University, California) replies to Burckhardt's criticism of Eusebius, that "Eusebius has been an inviting target for students of the Constantinian era. At one time or another they have characterized him as a political propagandist, a good courtier, the shrewd and worldly adviser of the Emperor Constantine, the great publicist of the first Christian emperor, the first in a long succession of ecclesiastical politicians, the herald of [[Byzantinism]], a political theologian, a political metaphysician, and a caesaropapist. It is obvious that these are not, in the main, neutral descriptions. Much traditional scholarship, sometimes with barely suppressed disdain, has regarded Eusebius as one who risked his orthodoxy and perhaps his character because of his zeal for the Constantinian establishment." Hollerich concludes that "... the standard assessment has exaggerated the importance of political themes and political motives in Eusebius's life and writings and has failed to do justice to him as a churchman and a scholar".

While many have shared Burckhardt's assessment, particularly with reference to the ''Life of Constantine'', others, while not pretending to extol his merits, have acknowledged the irreplaceable value of his works which may principally reside in the copious quotations that they contain from other sources, often lost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2564">'''Gerd von Hassler''' (or in German '''Gerd von Haßler''') (28 August 1928 – 7 January 1989) was a German [[author]], director, [[radio broadcaster]], [[composer]], [[singer]], [[journalist]] and producer.

==Life and career==

He was born Hans Leo Gerd von Haßler zu Roseneckh near [[Augsburg]], he studied [[literature]], [[music]] and [[ancient history]]. He later wrote children's plays which he became most famous for and was a radio speaker in which he produced plays ([[Radio drama]]). He also produced 27 records with which he composed or arranged music: shanties, student songs and [[folk music]].&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{icon de}} [http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,261810,00.html Spiegel online, 19. August 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{icon de}}[http://www.spirit-fanzine.de/heroes/texte/gerdvonhassler.htm Article about Gerd von Hassler]&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing many of his popular radio plays, Hassler took an interest in publishing a number of books. His main interest was studying the legendary continent of [[Atlantis]], which he discussed and documented in various publications such as his 1976 book ''Noahs Weg zum Amazonas'' (Noah's route to the Amazon), which was translated in English by the paranormal writer [[Martin Ebon]] under the title of ''The lost survivors of the deluge'' (1980). In the book Hassler discussed evidence for a [[global flood]] due to worldwide flood legends, [[Summerians]] describing a boat similar to [[Noah's ark]], [[Noah]] visiting the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and Atlantis being the [[Garden of Eden]]. The book is similar to the work of [[Charles Berlitz]] but Hassler never received mainstream recognition for his book like Berlitz did.&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyarama.org.uk/Links/Atlantis2.htm Atlantis and the Advanced Prehistoric World]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
A student of Camillo Guidi, Giuseppe Albenga received his ''laurea'' in civil engineering at the ''[[Politecnico di Torino]]'' in 1904.

Albenga was a professor extraordinarius of road and railway construction from 1914 to 1915 at the [[University of Bologna]] and from 1915 to 1918 at the [[University of Pisa]]. From 1919 to 1928 he taught construction science at the [[University of Bologna]].

In 1928 Albenga was appointed to the chair of bridge construction at the ''Politecnico di Torino'', where he was the rector from 1929 to 1932.&lt;ref name=TreccaniBio/&gt;

In 1928 he was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in Bologna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Albenga, G.|chapter=La scienza delle construzioni e Leonardo da Vinci|title=''In:'' Atti del Congresso Internazionale dei Matematici: Bologna del 3 al 10 de settembre di 1928|volume=vol. 6|pages=431–432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His main contributions were to the theory and practice of bridge construction and to the history of engineering — he was among the first to study the history of the development of [[reinforced concrete]].

His students include [[Odone Belluzzi]], [[Luigi Stabilini]], Letterio Francesco Donato, Augusto Cavallari Murat, Giulio Pizzetti, and Riccardo Baldacci.

'''Gregory of Tours''' (30 November c. 538 &amp;ndash; 17 November 594) was a [[Gallo-Roman]] [[History|historian]] and [[Bishops of Tours|Bishop of Tours]], which made him a leading [[prelate]] of the area that had been previously referred to as [[Gaul]] by the Romans. He was born '''Georgius Florentius''' and later added the name '''Gregorius''' in honour of his maternal great-grandfather.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;  He is the primary contemporary source for [[Merovingian]] history. His most notable work was his ''Decem Libri Historiarum'' (''Ten Books of Histories''), better known as the ''Historia Francorum'' (''History of the [[Franks]]''), a title that later chroniclers gave to it, but he is also known for his accounts of the [[miracle]]s of saints, especially four books of the miracles of [[St. Martin of Tours]]. St. Martin's tomb was a major pilgrimage destination in the 6th century, and St. Gregory's writings had the practical effect of promoting this highly organized devotion.

==Biography==
Gregory was born in [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]], in the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] region of central Gaul.&lt;ref name=butler&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/210/11/173.html Butler, Alban. ''The Lives of the Saints'', Vol. XI, 1866]&lt;/ref&gt; He was born into the upper stratum of Gallo-Roman society as the son of Florentius, [[Roman Senate#Senate in the West|Senator]] of Clermont, by his wife Armentaria II, niece of [[Nicetius of Lyon|Bishop Nicetius of Lyons]] and granddaughter of both Florentinus, Senator of Geneva, and Saint Gregory of Langres. Gregory had several noted bishops and saints as close relatives (his family effectively monopolised the Bishoprics of Tours, Lyons, and Langres at the time of his birth), and, according to Gregory, he was connected to thirteen of the eighteen bishops of Tours preceding him by ties of kinship. Gregory's paternal grandmother, Leocadia, descended from Vettius Epagatus, the illustrious martyr of Lyons.

His father evidently died while Gregory was young and his widowed mother moved to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] where she had property. Gregory went to live with his paternal uncle [[Gal I (Bishop of Clermont)|St. Gallus, Bishop of Clermont)]], under whom, and his successor St. Avitus, Gregory had his education. Gregory also received the clerical [[tonsure]] from Gallus. Having contracted a serious illness, he made a visit of devotion to the tomb of St. Martin at Tours. Upon his recovery, he began to pursue a clerical career and was ordained deacon by Avitus. Upon the death of [[Eufronius|St. Euphronius]], he was chosen as bishop by the clergy and people, who had been charmed with his piety, learning, and humility. Their deputies overtook him at the court of [[Sigebert I|King Sigebert of Austrasia]], and being compelled to acquiesce, though much against his will, Gregory was consecrated by Giles, Bishop of Rheims, on 22 August 573, at the age of thirty-four.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt;

He spent most of his career at Tours, although he assisted at the council of Paris in 577.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; The rough world he lived in was on the cusp of the dying world of Antiquity and the new culture of early [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Europe. Gregory lived also on the border between the Frankish culture of the Merovingians to the north and the Gallo-Roman culture of the south of Gaul.
[[Image:Division of Gaul - 511.jpg|thumb|Realms of [[Merovingian]] Gaul at the death of [[Clovis I|Clovis]] (511 AD).]]
At Tours, Gregory could not have been better placed to hear everything and meet everyone of influence in Merovingian culture. Tours lay on the watery highway of the navigable [[Loire]]. Five Roman roads radiated from Tours, which lay on the main thoroughfare between the Frankish north and Aquitania, with Spain beyond. At Tours the Frankish influences of the north and the Gallo-Roman influences of the south had their chief contact (see map). As the center for the popular cult of St Martin, Tours was a pilgrimage site, hospital, and a political sanctuary to which important leaders fled during periods of violence and turmoil in Merovingian politics.

Gregory struggled through personal relations with four Frankish kings, [[Sigebert I]], [[Chilperic I]], [[Guntram]], and [[Childebert II]] and he personally knew most of the leading Franks.

Gregory wrote in [[Late Latin]] which departed from [[Classical Latin|classical]] usage frequently in syntax and spelling with relatively few changes in inflection.&lt;ref&gt;Sandys, John Edwin. History of Classical Scholarship, Vol I. 434-435. Cambridge: CUP, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''History of the Franks''&lt;!--'Historia Francorum' redirects here--&gt;===

The ''Historia Francorum'' is in ten books. Books I to IV recount the world's history from the Creation but move quickly to the [[Christianization of Gaul]], the life and times of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin of Tours]], the conversion of the Franks and the conquest of Gaul under [[Clovis I|Clovis]], and the more detailed history of the Frankish kings down to the death of [[Sigebert I]] in 575. At this date Gregory had been bishop of Tours for two years.

The second part, books V and VI, closes with [[Chilperic I]]'s death in 584. During the years that Chilperic held Tours, relations between him and Gregory were tense. After hearing rumours that the Bishop of Tours had slandered his wife, [[Fredegund]], Chilperic had Gregory arrested and tried for treason—a charge which threatened both Gregory's bishopric and his life.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt; The most eloquent passage in the ''Historia''  is the closing chapter of book VI, in which Chilperic's character is summed up unsympathetically through the use of an invective.

The third part, comprising books VII to X, takes his increasingly personal account to the year 591. An [[epilogue]] was written in 594, the year of Gregory's death.

====Problems of interpretation====

Readers of the ''Historia Francorum'' must decide whether this is a royal history and whether Gregory was writing to please his patrons. It is likely that one royal Frankish house is more generously treated than others. Gregory was also a [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] bishop, and his writing reveals views typical of someone in his position. His views on perceived dangers of [[Arianism]] (still strong among the [[Visigoths]]) led him to preface the ''Historia'' with a detailed expression of his orthodoxy on the nature of Christ. In addition, his ridiculing of [[Paganism|pagans]] and [[Judaism|Jews]] reflected how his works were used to spread the [[Christian faith]]. For example, in book 2, chapters 28-31, he describes the pagans as incestuous and weak and then describes the process by which newly converted King Clovis leads a much better life than that of a pagan and is healed of all the conundrums he experienced as a pagan.

Gregory's education was the standard [[Latin]] one of [[Late Antiquity]], focusing on [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' and [[Martianus Capella]]'s ''Liber de Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae'', but also other key texts such as [[Orosius]]' ''Chronicles'', which his ''Historia'' continues, and [[Sallust]]; he refers to all these works in his own. His education, as was typical for the time, did not extend to a broad acquaintance with the pagan classics but rather progressed to mastery of the [[Vulgate Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first=Lewis|title=The History of the Franks|year=1974|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-044295-3|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that he constantly complained about his use of grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory of Tours, ''The History of the Franks''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not understand how to correctly write masculine and feminine phrases, reflecting either a lack of ability or changes in the Latin language. Though he had read Virgil, considered the greatest Latin stylist, he cautions that "We ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death."  By contrast, he seems to have thoroughly studied the lengthy and complex Vulgate Bible, as well as numerous religious works and historical treatises, which he frequently quotes, particularly in the earlier books of the ''Historia''.

The main impression that historians once retained from the ''Historia'' focused on Gregory's anecdotes about violence; until recently, historians tended to conclude that Merovingian Gaul was a chaotic, brutal mess. Recent scholarship has refuted that view. Through more careful readings, scholars have concluded that Gregory's underlying purpose was to highlight the vanity of secular life and contrast it with the miracles of the Saints.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Goffart (1988) and Mitchell and Wood (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Though Gregory conveys political and other messages through the ''Historia'', and these are studied very closely, historians now generally agree that this contrast is the central and ever-present narrative device.

===Hagiography===
His ''Life of the Fathers'' comprises twenty hagiographies of the most prominent men of the preceding generation, taking in a wide range the spiritual community of early medieval Gaul, including lives of bishops, clerics, monks, abbots, holy men and hermits. [[Illidius|St. Illidius]] is praised for his purity of heart, [[Bracchio|St. Brachio]] the abbot for his discipline and determination in study of the scriptures, [[Patroclus of Bourges|St Patroclus]] for his unwavering faith in the face of weakness, and [[Nicetius of Lyon|St. Nicetius]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lyon|bishop of Lyon]], for his justice. It is the life of [[Nicetius of Trier|St. Nicetius of Trier]], though, which dominates this book; his great authority and sense of episcopal responsibility  which is the focus of Gregory's account as his figure, predestined to be great, bestrides the lives of the others. It is told that he felt a weight on his head, but he was unable to see what it was when turning around, though upon smelling its sweet scent he realised that it was the weight of episcopal responsibility. (''Life of the Fathers'', XVII, 1) He surmounts the others in the glory of his miracles, and was chosen by [[God]] to have the entire succession of past and future Frankish kings revealed to him.

A further aspect of this work to note is the appearance of Gregory himself in certain sections, notably in the life of St. Leobardus. This is for two reasons: Firstly, it creates a distinct link between the temporal and the spiritual worlds, firmly placing the accounts of the lives in a world which is understandable and recognisable, or, seen from the other angle, confirming the presence of miracles in the temporal world. Secondly, the intercession of Gregory serves to set Leobardus straight, after he had been tempted by the devil (''Life of the Fathers'', XX, 3), and so this act further enhances the authority of bishops as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===Fighting heresy===
Gregory's avowed aim in writing this book was to "fire others with that enthusiasm by which the saints deservedly climbed to heaven", though this was not his sole purpose, and he most surely did not expect his entire audience to show promise of such piety as to witness the power of God flowing through them in the way that it did for the fathers. More immediate concerns were at the forefront of his mind as he sought to create a further layer of religious commitment, not only to the Church at Rome, but to local churches and cathedrals throughout Gaul. Along with his other books, notably the ''Glory of the Confessors'', the ''Glory of the Martyrs'' and the ''Life of St. Martin'', meticulous attention is paid to the local as opposed to the universal Christian experience. Within these grandiloquent lives are tales and anecdotes which tie miracles, saints and their relics to a great diversity of local areas, furnishing his audience with greater knowledge of their local shrine, and providing them with evidence of the work of God in their immediate vicinity, thus greatly expanding their connection with and understanding of their faith. Attacks on heresy also appear throughout his hagiographies, and Arianism is taken to be the common face of heresy across Europe, exposed to great ridicule. Often, the scenes which expose the weaknesses of heresy (''Glory of the Martyrs'', 79, 80) focus on images of fire and burning, whilst the Catholics are proved right by the protection lavished on them by God.

This was of great relevance to Gregory himself as he presided over the important see of Tours, where extensive use was made of the cult of St. Martin in establishing the authority of the bishopric with the congregation and in the context of the Frankish church. Gregory's hagiography was an essential component of this. However, this should not be seen as a selfish grab for power on behalf of the bishops who emerge so triumphantly from the ''Life of the Fathers'', but rather as a bid for hegemony of doctrine and control over the practice of worship, which they believed to be in the best interests of their congregation and the wider church.

===Gregory's Creed===
As an example of Gregory's zeal in his fight against heresy, the ''Historia Francorum'' includes a declaration of faith with which Gregory aimed to prove his orthodoxy with respect to the heresies of his time ("so that my reader may have no doubt that I am Catholic for they are.").&lt;ref&gt;Book I.i&lt;/ref&gt; The confession is in many phrases, each of which refutes a specific Christian heresy. Thus Gregory's creed presents, in the negative, a virtual litany of heresies:

{{Quote|I believe, then, in God the Father omnipotent. I believe in [[Jesus Christ]] his only Son, our Lord God, born of the Father, not created. [I believe] that he has always been with the Father, not only since time began but before all time. For the Father could not have been so named unless he had a son; and there could be no son without a father. But as for those who say: "There was a time when he was not," [note: A leading belief of Arian Christology.] I reject them with curses, and call men to witness that they are separated from the church. I believe that the word of the Father by which all things were made was Christ. I believe that this word was made flesh and by its suffering the world was redeemed, and I believe that humanity, not deity, was subject to the suffering. I believe that he rose again on the third day, that he freed sinful man, that he ascended to heaven, that he sits on the right hand of the Father, that he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe that the holy Spirit proceeded from the Father and the Son, that it is not inferior and is not of later origin, but is God, equal and always coeternal with the Father and the Son, consubstantial in its nature, equal in omnipotence, equally eternal in its essence, and that it has never existed apart from the Father and the Son and is not inferior to the Father and the Son. I believe that this holy Trinity exists with separation of persons, and one person is that of the Father, another that of the Son, another that of the Holy Spirit. And in this Trinity confess that there is one Deity, one power, one essence. I believe that the blessed Mary was a virgin after the birth as she was a virgin before. I believe that the soul is immortal but that nevertheless it has no part in deity. And I faithfully believe all things that were established at Nicæa by the three hundred and eighteen bishops. But as to the end of the world I hold beliefs which I learned from our forefathers, that Antichrist will come first. An Antichrist will first propose circumcision, asserting that he is Christ; next he will place his statue in the temple at Jerusalem to be worshiped, just as we read that the Lord said: "You shall see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place." But the Lord himself declared that that day is hidden from all men, saying; "But of that day and that hour knoweth no one not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father alone." Moreover we shall here make answer to the heretics [note: the Arians] who attack us, asserting that the Son is inferior to the Father since he is ignorant of this day. Let them learn then that Son here is the name applied to the Christian people, of whom God says: "I shall be to them a father and they shall be to me for sons." For if he had spoken these words of the only begotten Son he would never have given the angels first place. For he uses these words: "Not even the angels in heaven nor the Son," showing that he spoke these words not of the only-begotten but of the people of adoption. But our end is Christ himself, who will graciously bestow eternal life on us if we turn to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html#book3 Gregory of Tours (539-594): ''History of the Franks'': Books I-X "In Christ's Name Here Begins The First Book Of The Histories."] Medieval Sourcebook&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
The ''Historia Francorum'' is of salient historical interest, representing as it does the central narrative with respect to the [[Franks]] for the period of transition from Roman to Medieval, and the establishment of the large and important Frankish state.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Wallace-Hadrill, ''The Barbarian West'' (London 1964) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;   With his lively style, story-telling ability, and skill in conveying human interest, Gregory has been compared to [[Herodotus]];&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Gwatkin ed., ''The Cambridge Medieval History Vol II'' (Cambridge 1926) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; with his detailed interest in, and accounts of, ecclesiastical history and manoeuvrings, to a bloodier [[Anthony Trollope|Trollope]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Burrow, ''A History of Histories'' (Penguin 2009) p. 208-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory's hagiographies are also an invaluable source of anecdotes and stories which enrich our understanding of life and belief in Merovingian Gaul. The motivation behind his works was to show readers the importance and strength of Christianity.  Alongside [[Venantius Fortunatus]], he is the outstanding literary figure from the 6thC Merovingian world;&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Gwatkin ed., ''The Cambridge Medieval History Vol II'' (Cambridge 1926) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; and his extensive literary output is itself a testimony to the preservation of learning and to the lingering continuity of Gallo-Roman civic culture through the [[early Middle Ages]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7631">The '''Götaland theory''' (or "Westrogothian School", [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''Västgötaskolan'') is a local patriotic view which challenges established history and archaeology, and claims that the foundation of [[Sweden]] occurred not (as traditionally assumed) in Eastern Sweden, but in the province of Westrogothia ([[Västergötland]]). The adherents of this idea use wide-ranging methods from controversial ones such as [[dowsing]] and asking [[Mediumship|medium]]s to contact the dead, to less controversial ones such as [[etymology]], but also claim that the established academic material consists of lies and forgeries. Although well known in Sweden and fervently preached by its adherents, it has never been accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson 2002:8:

|}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl-Otto Fast, founder of the Westrogothian School ("Västgötaskolan"), was a notorious Nazi who collaborated with [[Ahnenerbe|SS Ahnenerbe]], [[Richard Walther Darré]] and eugenicists from Hadamar in Germany. The idea that the cradle of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] culture and society was located in Västergötland, became an indisputable dogma in Nazi Germany.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Archaeologist [[Magnus Alkarp]], who has studied classified and semi-classified documents from the post-war era, has showed that the Westrogothian School (among other regional, right-wing separatists movements in Scandinavia) was an important part of the [[Operation Gladio]].

==Putting the theory to the test==
Several times, laymen have unsuccessfully tried to prove what they consider important aspects of the Götaland theory. The barrow at [[Skalunda]] was thus claimed to be the burial site of the hero [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]] known from the ''[[Beowulf]]'' epic; by applying the [[dowsing]] technique with a pendulum, they established that the barrow was indeed the burial site of this Geatish hero.&lt;ref name="Larsson90"&gt;Larsson 2002:90&lt;/ref&gt; Later, professional archaeologists drilled into the barrow to extract a sample for [[Radiocarbon dating|C14 dating]].&lt;ref name="Larsson90"/&gt; The barrow was from around 700 A.D., about 150 years too late for being a candidate for Beowulf's burial site.&lt;ref name="Larsson90"/&gt;

The locality [[Sätuna]] at the small lake [[Hornborgasjön]] in Västergötland was commonly claimed to be the true [[Sigtuna]], where king [[Olof Skötkonung]] had his coins made.&lt;ref name="Larsson34"&gt;Larsson 2002:34&lt;/ref&gt; A protrusion in the ground was pointed out by adherents of the Götaland theory as the king's mint.&lt;ref name="Larsson34"/&gt; However, when archaeologists examined their claims the protrusion turned out to be the remains of an uncompleted barn from the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Larsson34"/&gt;

== History ==
The Götaland theory originated in the early 20th century with claims that the ancient city [[Ubsola]] (''Uppsala'') was situated in the province of [[Västergötland]] in the old lands called ''Uplanden''. Additionally, the theory's supporters also held the view that Västergötland and the region of Lake [[Vänern]] was in fact the land of "Sithun", translated into modern day language as ''[[Sigtuna]]'', where [[Odin]] and his [[Aesir]] companions supposedly settled when they came to [[Scandinavia]].

An early predecessor of the theory was [[Pehr Tham]] (1737&amp;ndash;1820), who during the 19th century unsuccessfully tried to promote ideas such as the village [[Sätuna]] being the location of [[Old Sigtuna]], and the ancient town of [[Birka]] being situated somewhere around Lake [[Hornborgasjön]]. He is regarded as a successor of [[Olof Rudbeckius]], a seventeenth-century scholar who claimed that Sweden was the true location of the sunken [[Atlantis]].

The early proponents of the Götaland theory proposed ideas about Västergötland, and the Lake Väner region in particular, being the origin not only of the [[Geats]], but also of the [[Suiones]], the [[Denmark|Danes]]; and furthermore the location of various phenomena in [[Norse mythology]], such as [[Odin]]'s [[Sithun]] (''[[Sigtuna]]''), [[Valhalla|Valhall]], and the ashtree [[Yggdrasil]]. These ideas, created in the spirit of [[Romanticism]], were also a reaction to the archaeological research at the time, which arguably neglected some areas of Sweden that were nevertheless rich in archaeological remains. The speculations of the adherents of the Götaland theory movement are largely irrelevant to modern academic discussion, which does not pay much attention to [[Swedish-Geatish wars]], [[Yngling]] kings, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Gahrn 1988, Strömberg 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially, the story of Odin and the Aesir's emigration according to the [[Ynglinga saga]] is generally considered invalid by the official views and scholars. Other parts of the extensive work of Snorri Sturluson (and other saga writers) may however be considered valid references for finding elements of the ancient history of [[Scandinavia]]n people and their religious customs and beliefs.

==Birka speculations ==
The town [[Birka]] is also known from the ''[[Vita Ansgari]]'', in which [[Ansgar]] founds a [[Mission (station)|mission]] in the town. It is commonly identified with a location on [[Björkö, Ekerö|Björkö]] in lake Mälaren. This location is a [[World Heritage Site]] and a popular tourism attraction.

According to the Västgöta theory, ''Birka'' as a name meant "merchant town", and could refer to any such town in ancient Sweden.

==''Ubsola'' speculations ==
''Upsalum'', or ''Ubsola'', was the main cult center of [[paganism|pagan]] (heathen) Ása-faith in ancient Scandinavia and Sweden. The ancient Upsalum was described by [[Adam of Bremen]] in the 11th century, and by [[Snorri Sturluson]] in the 13th century. It is generally considered to correspond to modern day [[Uppsala]], with its location on Uppsala's old location &amp;ndash; [[Old Uppsala]], in east Sweden, the habitat of the ancient tribe called [[Suiones]] (Swedes). The Västgöta school however claim that the original site for the [[Temple at Uppsala|temple]] was located in West Sweden, in the habitat of the ancient [[Geats]] (''Götar''), the tribe which came to name ''Västergötland''.

There are however no archeological findings that support the view of Västergötland being the original site of Ubsola, and therefore the views of the Västgöta theory have little or no credibility.

'''Henry of Rebdorf''' is the name given to the alleged author of an imperial and papal chronicle of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The only connexion between the chronicle to which the name of Henry of Rebdorf has been attached and the foundation of the Augustinian canons at Rebdorf, near [[Eichstätt]], Bavaria, lay in the fact that the first editor of the said chronicle published it from a manuscript preserved there, and later taken to the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]] in Paris, while other manuscripts, displaying no essential points of difference, are known to exist in [[Klosterneuburg Monastery]] and in the [[Hofbibliothek]] in Vienna.

Its title is: ''Chronica'', or ''Annales rerum ab imperatoribus Adolpho, Alberto, Friderico, Ludovico Bavarico et Carolo IV. gestarum'', or again ''Annales imperatorum et paparum''. It is a chronological treatise extending from 1294 to 1362, and consists of two parts. The first part is a sequel to what is called the ''Flores Temporum'', a well-known chronicle of the world's history compiled by a [[Swabia]]n Franciscan, and reaches to the year 1343; it was probably compiled by an unknown writer about 1346 or 1347. The second part is a history of the twenty years from 1343 to 1363. Its author was the magister Heinrich Taub, or Heinrich der Taube (Heinrich the Deaf), or Henricus Surdus of Selbach, who officiated as [[chaplain]] at St. Willibald's in Eichstätt and died about 1364. Practically nothing has been learned of his life. We only know that he journeyed to Rome in 1350, for the purpose of gaining the [[Jubilee (Christian)|jubilee]] indulgence, and that in 1361 in Nuremberg he admired the crown jewels then exhibited in honour of the christening of the newborn imperial prince, [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]]. Various conjectures have been made as to the personality of the author, but nothing certain has been established. The chronicle itself, particularly in its second part, has some importance, and was first edited by [[Marquard Freher]] in ''Rerum Germanicarum Scriptores'', I, 411-52 (Frankfurt-am-Main, 1600); 2nd ed., 1634; again by Gewold (Ingolstadt, 1618); later by Struve (Strasbourg, 1717), and finally by Böhmer-Huber in ''Fontes rerum Germanicarum'', IV (1868), 507-68. It was translated into German under the title: ''Annales Imperatorum et Paparum Eistettenses'', by Dieringer (Eichstätt, 1883); also by Grandaur in the ''Geschichtschreiber der deutschen Vorzeit'' (Leipzig, 1883).

The two teams stand ready, each side has 24 knights, all with heraldic [[surcoat]]s and [[caparison]]s, and each accompanied by a banner-bearer with a [[heraldic flag]].
There is a central spectators' box for the four judges, where the [[heraldic shield]]s of the competitors are displayed, 
the two teams being led by the dukes of [[duke of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[duke of Bourbon|Bourbon]], respectively, and one spectator box on each side for the ladies; inscribed over the boxes is ''plus est en vous'', the [[heraldic motto]] of the [[Gruuthuse]] family of Bruges, attributed to tournament between  [[Jean III de Gruuthuse]] and Jean de Ghistelles held in 1393.&lt;ref&gt;Octave Delepierre, '' Précis des annales de Bruges'' (1835) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=eIpDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 38f]. René of Anjou's contemporary [[Louis de Gruuthuse]] himself was a famous competitor in tournaments during the 1440s.&lt;/ref&gt; The two dukes can be seen facing each other in the center of the front lines, each with a personal heraldic flag as well with a larger flag of the same design representing their team.
The chief [[herald]] is also on horseback, between the two teams, wearing his own heraldic colours.]]

'''[[Heraldry]]''' is the system of visual identification of rank and [[genealogy|pedigree]] which developed 
in the European [[High Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name="CGH 1–18"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; closely associated with the [[Royal court|courtly]] culture of [[chivalry]], 
[[Latin Church|Latin Christianity]], the [[Crusades]], [[feudalism|feudal]] [[nobility|aristocracy]], and [[Monarchies in Europe|monarchy]] of the time. 
Heraldic tradition fully developed in the 13th century, and it flourished and developed further during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern period]].
Originally limited to nobility, heraldry is adopted by wealthy commoners in the Late Middle Ages ([[Burgher arms]]). 
Specific traditions of [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]] also develop in the late medieval period. 
Coats of arms of noble families, often after their extinction, becomes attached to the territories they used to own, giving rise to [[municipal coats of arms]] by the 16th century.

Western heraldry spread beyond its core territory of Latin Christendom in the 17th century, Western heraldic traditions being adopted in the [[Russian Empire]].

With the decline of European monarchies in favour of [[Republicanism]] in the 19th to 20th centuries, heraldic tradition declined in importance, but modern [[national flag]]s and [[national emblem]]s adopted in the 19th and 20th century still frequently use elements inherited from heraldic tradition.

==Precursors==

[[File:Harold dead bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|Depiction of [[kite shield]]s with cross or spiral ornaments in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (c. 1070).]]
Traditions of [[field sign]]s, personal [[emblem]]s or [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] go back to at least the [[Ancient Near East|Bronze Age]].
The [[Ekphrasis|ekphrastic]] description of [[shield]] designs in particular is found as a topos in classical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Units of the Roman army were sometimes identified by distinctive markings on their shields.&lt;ref&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', Bodleian Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldry developed in the [[high medieval period]], based on earlier, "pre-heraldic" or "ante-heraldic", traditions of visual identification by means of  [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]s,  [[field sign]]s, emblems used on [[numismatics|coins]], etc. Notably, [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] that would subsequently appear in 12th-century coats of arms of European nobility have pre-figurations in the [[animal style]] of ancient art (specifically  the style of [[Scythian art]] as it developed from c. the 7th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;"significant pre-figuration of medieval heraldry"  John Onians, ''Atlas of World Art'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Western heraldry is an innovation of the 12th century. Certain members of the high nobility began to display animals, 
specifically [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] on their shields beginning in c. the 1140s. 
Prior to this, western military shields of the 11th to early 12th century did sometimes show simple decorations, but not apparently tied to the personal identification of the bearer.

The [[Bayeux Tapestry]], illustrating the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of England in 1066, and probably commissioned about 1077, when the cathedral of Bayeux was rebuilt, depicts a number of shields of various shapes and designs, many of which are plain, while others are decorated with dragons, crosses, or other typically heraldic figures.  Yet no individual is depicted twice bearing the same arms, nor are any of the descendants of the various persons depicted known to have borne devices resembling those in the tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;John Woodward and George Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry: British and Foreign'', W. &amp; A. K. Johnson, Edinburgh and London (1892), vol. 1, pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Frankish or German [[round shield]]s of the 11th century ([[Ottonian]], [[Salian dynasty|Salian]]) are sometimes depicted with simple geometric ornamentation, but not with figurative emblems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vikingage.org/wiki/wiki/Round_Shield_Designs Round Shield Designs (vikingage.org)]: "chequered" (11th c., Biblio. Mun. Avranches MS50), "flared cross" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), 
"spirals" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), "spirals with dots" (c.1000-1020 Bamberg MS A. II. 42 Bamberg Apocalypse).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, an account of the French knights at the court of the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius I]] at the beginning of the twelfth century describes their shields of polished metal, utterly devoid of heraldic design.  A Spanish manuscript from 1109 describes both plain and decorated shields, none of which appears to have been heraldic.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] contained a window commemorating the knights who embarked on the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147, and was probably made soon after the event; but [[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon's]] illustration of the window before it was destroyed shows no heraldic design on any of the shields.&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proto-heraldry (12th century)==
{{seealso|List of oldest heraldry|Equestrian seal}}
[[File:Thibaut Blois.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of the [[equestrian seal]] of [[Theobald III, Count of Blois]], dated 1138. Traces of an ornamental cross design are visible on the shield.]]
The 12th-century tradition is mostly preserved in the form of the [[equestrian seal]]s popular at the time which show the nobleman as a fully armed warrior on horseback. Early equestrian seals show plain shields. From the mid 12th century, proto-heraldic designs are sometimes shown, but the shield is shown naturally, as part of the knight's armament, and is often seen in profile or partially obscured. 
The [[:File:Demay p6.jpg|equestrian seal]] of Enguerrand (Ingelram), [[count of Saint-Pol]] (1130s or 1140s) still shows a plain shield, but what would later become [[heraldic charge]]s (in this case, sheaves of corn) are shown arranged around the horse.&lt;ref&gt;"le blason fait son apparition dans les dernières années du XIIe siècle, brusquement, sans transition. Mais il est d’autres types plus anciens où les pièces des armoiries existent, s’annonçant pour ainsi dire avant de passer dans l’écu. Le sceau d’Enguerran, comte de Saint-Pol, antérieur à l’année 1150, est de ce nombre. Il offre déjà plusieurs ''gerbes'' dispersées dans le champ." 
G. Demay, ''Le Blason d’après les sceaux du Moyen-Âge'' (1877), [https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Demay_-_Le_Blason_d’après_les_sceaux_du_Moyen-Âge,_1877.djvu/7 p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;
Seals displaying actual heraldic shields appear by the very end of the 12th century or the early years of the 13th century.

Seals with elements of a distinctly heraldic character begin to appear in the second third of the 12th century.
A number of seals dating from between 1135 and 1155 appear to show the adoption of heraldic devices in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|Thomas Woodcock]] &amp; [[John Martin Robinson]], ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', Oxford University Press, New York (1988), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  
A notable example of an early armorial seal is attached to a charter granted by [[Philip I, Count of Flanders]], in 1164.  Seals from the latter part of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries show no evidence of heraldic symbolism, but by the end of the twelfth century, seals are uniformly heraldic in nature.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ''Heraldry in England'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the oldest equestrial seals with armorials are those of [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[House of Welf]], duke of Saxony (1142&amp;ndash;1180) and Bavaria (1156&amp;ndash;1180). A total of seven seals of Henry's are known. Of these, only the second shows a recognizable [[heraldic lion|lion]] displayed on his shield. This seal is attached to two documents dated to 1146. It is possible that the lion was also on the first seal (c. 1142), but it is no longer recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;Xenja von Ertzdorff, Rudolf Schulz, Winfried Baumann, ''Die Romane von dem Ritter mit dem Löwen'' (1994), p. 175,
citing Schmidt-Phiseldeck, '' Die Siegel des herzoglichen Hauses Braunschweig und Lüneburg'', nr. 1&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt;
An equestrian seal of similar antiquity is [[:File:Ottokar III of Styria 1160.jpg|that]] of [[Ottokar III of Styria]], dated 1160, with an early form of the [[Styria]]n [[Panther (legendary creature)|panther]] on his shield.

[[File:Geoffrey of Anjou Monument.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Enamel from the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], showing his shield in profile, with four out of what were presumably six lions visible (six lions are on the shield of the effigy of  his grandson  [[William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William Longespée]], d. 1226).]]
The oldest extant depiction of a coloured armoury can be seen on the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], who died in 1151.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  An enamel, probably commissioned by Geoffrey's widow between 1155 and 1160, depicts him carrying a blue shield decorated with six golden lions rampant.  He wears a blue helmet adorned with another lion, and his cloak is lined in vair.  A medieval chronicle states that Geoffrey was given a shield of this description when he was knighted by his father-in-law, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], in 1128; but this account probably dates to about 1175.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Stothard, ''Monumental Effigies of Great Britain'' (1817) pl. 2, illus. in Anthony Wagner, Richmond Herald, ''Heraldry in England'', Penguin (1946), pl. I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Discoveries_Heraldry.html?id=hmZ5QgAACAAJ Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition]'', "[[Abrams Discoveries]]" series. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. (1997), {{p.|18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest evidence of the association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future [[John, King of England|King John]] during the lifetime of his father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who died in 1189.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it seems reasonable to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield.  John's elder brother, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], who succeeded his father on the throne, is believed to have been the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early mention of heraldic shields in [[Middle High German literature]] also dates to the 12th century.
Shield designs are described in the  ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'' (c. 1150&amp;ndash;1170), such as the boar carried by the Romans, as well as, in isolated cases, in the ''[[The Song of Roland|Rolandslied]]'' (c. 1115), ''[[King Rother|König Rother]]'' (c. 1150), [[Heinrich von Veldeke|Veldecke's ''Eneas'']] (c. 1170), and [[Erec (poem)|Hartmann's ''Erec'']] (c. 1185).
These appear in the larger context of describing an armed protagonist, and are not yet tied to the bearer's pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;"With the exception of several heraldic shields that appear in the ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'', such as the boar carried by the Romans&amp;mdash;the oldest heraldic insignia in medieval German epic literature, according to Zips [''Wappenwesen'', 1966]&amp;mdash;most of the precourtly and even courtly epics up to 1200 contain very few decorated shields at all. Several isolated coats of arms are mentioned in the German ''[[The Song of Roland|Rolandslied]]'', ''[[King Rother|König Rother]]'', [[Heinrich von Veldeke|Veldecke's ''Eneas'']], and [[Erec (poem)|Hartmann's ''Erec'']]&amp;mdash;mostly related to the protagonists." Wandhoff (2016),  ([https://books.google.ch/books?id=5mYYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 p. 57]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barbarossa.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Depiction of emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] as a [[Crusades|Crusader]] (c. 1188). The [[heraldic cross|cross symbol]] worn on the shield and surcoat at this time is not a heraldic charge identifying the bearer but a [[field sign]] worn by all participants in the Crusade.]]
At least two distinctive features of heraldry are generally accepted as products of the [[Crusades]]: the surcoat, an outer garment worn over the armor to protect the wearer from the heat of the sun, was often decorated with the same devices that appeared on a knight's shield.  It is from this garment that the phrase "coat of arms" is derived.{{dubious|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--the term is from the 14th century, and has no direct relation to the crusades at all--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also the lambrequin, or mantling, that depends from the helmet and frames the shield in modern heraldry, began as a practical covering for the helmet and the back of the neck during the Crusades,{{cn|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--do you mean the period of the crusades (i.e. the 12th century), or the actual campaign? If the latter, what is the evidence?--&gt;
serving much the same function as the surcoat.  Its slashed or scalloped edge, today rendered as billowing flourishes, is thought to have originated from hard wearing in the field, or as a means of deadening a sword blow and perhaps entangling the attacker's weapon.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval heraldry==
{{see|Roll of arms}}
[[File:DeringRoll.jpg|thumb|200px|''Dering Roll'', c. 1270, Dover, one of the oldest extant [[Roll of arms|rolls of arms]], showing the coats of arms as yet without [[helmet (heraldry)|helmets]] or any other achievements.]]
[[File:Zürcher Wappenrolle um 1340.jpg|thumb|200px|Part of the [[Zürich armorial]] (c. 1340), an early example of the tradition of representing coats of arms with a representation of [[helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]].]]
===Terminology===
{{see|Blazon}}
The origin of the term ''[[:wikt:heraldry|heraldry]]'' itself ([[Middle English]] ''heraldy'', [[Old French]] ''hiraudie''), can be placed in the context of the early forms of the [[Tournament (medieval)|knightly tournament]]s in the 12th century. Combattants wore full armour, and identified themselves by wearing their emblems on their [[heater shield|shields]]. A [[herald]] (Old French ''heraut'', from a [[Frankish language|Frankish]] ''*hariwald'' "commander of an army") was an officer who would announce the competitors. 

Originally a type of messenger employed by noblemen, heralds assumed the responsibility of learning and knowing the rank, pedigree, and heraldic devices of various knights and lords, as well as the rules and protocols governing the design and description, or ''blazoning'' of arms, and the precedence of their bearers.&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as the late thirteenth century, certain heralds in the employ of monarchs were given the title "King of Heralds", which eventually became "[[King of Arms]]."&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"/&gt;

The term ''[[coat of arms]]''  in origin refers to the [[surcoat]] with heraldic designs worn by combattants, especially in the knightly tournament, in Old French ''cote a armer''. The sense is transferred to the heraldic design itself in Middle English, in the mid-14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/coat%20of%20arms#etymonline_v_28240 etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heraldic shield===
{{see|Escutcheon (heraldry)}}
By about the 1230s, the shields used by cavalry were almost triangular in shape, referred to as [[heater shield]]s. Such a 
shield is preserved, the shield of [[Konrad von Thüringen]], dated c. 1230, showing the ''lion barry'' of the [[Ludovingians]].
This heater-shaped form was used in warfare during the apogee of the [[Chivalry|Age of Chivalry]], and it becomes the classic heraldic shield, or [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], at about the time of the [[Battle of Crecy]] (1346) and the founding of the [[Order of the Garter]] (1348), when heraldry had become a fully developed system.
All medieval [[roll of arms|rolls of arms]], from the late 13th and throughout the 14th to 15th century, almost exclusively use this shield shape. 

&lt;gallery&gt;

The shield at this time still has the [[kite shield|"kite" shape]].

===Division of the field===
{{see|Division of the field}}
Coats of arms of the 13th century in some cases already include marks of [[cadency]] to distinguish descendants, but they mostly still do without [[division of the field]] to indicate descent from more than one lineage. 
An exception is the [[coat of arms of Castile and León]], showing
the [[Heraldry of Castile|arms of Castile]] (the yellow castle) [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] with the [[Heraldry of León|arms of León]] (the purple lion) in the late 13th century ''[[Camden Roll]]'' and  ''Segar's Roll''.
This practice becomes much more common in the late medieval period. For example, the  arms of [[Eric of Pomerania]] as king of the [[Kalmar Union]] (r. 1396–1439) combine five coats of arms, for Denmark, Sweden, the [[House of Bjelbo]], Pomerania and Norway, quartered by a cross gules and with a central [[inescutcheon]].
In the later 15th century, holders of ecclesiastical office would quarter their family arms with those of the 
order or diocese they represented. Thus [[Pierre d'Aubusson]] as grand master of the [[Knights of Malta]] quartered his family arms with the [[Maltese cross]]; bishop [[Hugo von Hohenlandenberg]] quartered his family arms with those of the [[bishopric of Constance|prince-bishopric of Constance]].

===Heraldic authorities===
{{see|Heraldic authority}}
By the middle of the fourteenth century, the principle that only a single individual was entitled to bear a particular coat of arms was generally accepted, and disputes over the ownership of arms seems to have led to gradual establishment of heraldic authorities to regulate their use.  The earliest known work of [[Law of Arms|heraldic jurisprudence]], ''De Insigniis et Armis'', was written about 1350 by [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato]], a professor of law at the [[University of Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/bartolo.htm ''De Insigniis et Armis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Squibb, "The Law of Arms in England", in ''The Coat of Arms'' vol. II, no. 15 (Spring 1953), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The most celebrated armorial dispute in English heraldry is that of ''[[Scrope v Grosvenor]]'' (1390), in which two different men claimed the right to bear ''azure, a bend or''.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  The continued proliferation of arms, and the number of disputes arising from different men assuming the same arms, led [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] to issue a proclamation in 1419, forbidding all those who had not borne arms at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] from assuming arms, except by inheritance or a grant from the crown.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siebmacher002.jpg|thumb|upright|Royal coats of arms in ''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]'' (1605)]]
In 1484, during the reign of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the various heralds employed by the crown were incorporated into the [[College of Arms]], through which all new grants of arms would eventually be issued.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"&gt;Pastoureau, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The college currently consists of three Kings of Arms, assisted by six Heralds, and four [[Pursuivants]], or junior officers of arms, all under the authority of the [[Earl Marshal]]; but all of the arms granted by the college are graÅnted by the authority of the crown.&lt;ref name="CoA Official Site"&gt;[http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us/heralds-officers College of Arms official website], accessed 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar bodies regulate the granting of arms in other monarchies and several members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but in most other countries there is no heraldic authority, and no law preventing anyone from assuming whatever arms they please, provided that they do not infringe upon the arms of another.&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"/&gt;

Beginning in the reign of [[Henry VIII]], the Kings of Arms were commanded to make ''[[heraldic visitation|visitations]]'', in which they traveled about the country, recording arms borne under proper authority, and requiring those who bore arms without authority either to obtain authority for them, or cease their use.  Arms borne improperly were to be taken down and defaced.  The first such visitation began in 1530, and the last was carried out in 1700, although no new commissions to carry out visitations were made after the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1689.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn, ''Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry'', MacGibbon &amp; Kee, London (1960), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[early modern period]], heraldry became highly complex and standardised, divided into "national"  traditions. 
Western heraldry can be divided into three large cultural groups, "Gallo-British", "German-Nordic" and "Latin".
Part of the Gallo-British group are [[French heraldry|French]], 
[[English heraldry|English]] and [[Scottish heraldry|Scottish]] traditions. The "German-Nordic" group includes the tradition of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its greater sphere of incluence, including 
[[German heraldry]], [[Swedish heraldry]], [[Norwegian heraldry]], [[Danish heraldry]], [[Russian heraldry]],  [[Polish heraldry]], [[Hungarian heraldry]], [[Croatian heraldry]], [[Serbian heraldry]], etc.

The "Latin" group includes [[Italian heraldry]], [[Spanish heraldry]] and [[Portuguese heraldry]].

[[Dutch heraldry]] shows influence of all three groups.

Prominent burghers and corporations, including many cities and towns, assumed or obtained grants of arms, with only nominal military associations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gwynn-Jones, ''The Art of Heraldry: Origins, Symbols, and Designs'', Parkgate Books/Barnes &amp; Noble (1998), pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heraldic devices were depicted in various contexts, such as religious and funerary art, and in using a wide variety of media, including stonework, carved wood, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[stained glass]], and [[embroidery]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottfried Neubecker, ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'', Macdonald and James Publishers (1977), pp. 253–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the abandonment of the [[joust]] as courtly practice at the beginning of the 17th century,  heraldic achievements, especially the [[helmet (heraldry)|heraldry]], ceased to be tied to the technological development or fashion of [[jousting armour]] and shapes of helmets became purely conventional, and in the various regional systems, separate types of helmets came to be tied to separate ranks of nobility.

[[Baroque]] heraldic designs became increasingly elaborate, both in terms of the increasingly complex [[division of the field]] and in terms of the surrounding achievements, culminating in the development of "landscape heraldry", incorporating realistic depictions of landscapes, during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century.

==Modern heraldry==
{{see|Socialist heraldry|National coat of arms|National flag}}
{{see|United States heraldry|Canadian heraldry|Mexican heraldry|New Zealand heraldry|Puerto Rican heraldry|South African heraldry|Coats of arms and emblems of Africa}}
{{see|Consulta Araldica|State Herald of Sweden|Heraldic Council of the President of the Russian Federation|Flemish Heraldic Council|Bureau of Heraldry|Canadian Heraldic Authority|United States Army Institute of Heraldry|State Council of Heraldry|New Zealand Herald Extraordinary}}
In the mid-19th century, there was  a renewed interest in the history of armory,
but now mostly from an [[antiquarian]]'s or [[genealogy|genealogist]]'s perspective. This led to a re-evaluation of older designs over Baroque and Roccoco styles, a new appreciation for the medieval origins of the art.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the late nineteenth century, heraldry has focused on the use of varied lines of partition and little-used ordinaries to produce new and unique designs.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "heraldry" is sometimes used to include the [[national emblem]]s of modern states. Some modern states, especially constitutional monarchies, use national coats of arms (such as the [[coat of arms of Denmark]] or the [[coat of arms of Spain]]).
States with republican tradition tend to avoid coats of arms, using "national seals" or "national emblems" instead, such as the [[national emblem of France]], the [[national emblem of Turkey]] or the [[Great Seal of the United States]].

The book explores global natural history collecting through the career of Hans Sloane, which culminated in the foundation of the British Museum in 1753, the world's first national public museum. It examines Sloane's career from his background in Ulster and voyage to the slave society of Jamaica to his creation of a network of collectors who gathered curiosities across the globe, making possible the establishment of the British Museum. It draws on the histories of science, medicine and collecting, as well as Caribbean, imperial and global histories, and is based on over a decade of research in Sloane's surviving specimens, objects, manuscripts and catalogues in London's Natural History Museum, the British Museum and the British Library.

{{Other people|John Campbell}}
'''John Campbell''' (8 March 1708 – 28 December 1775)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Campbell, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Scottish author.  He contributed to [[George Sale]]'s ''[[Universal History (Sale et al.)|Universal History]]'', and wrote a ''Political Survey of Britain'' (1744). He was both prolific and well paid: according to [[James Boswell]], [[Samuel Johnson]] spoke of Campbell to [[Joseph Warton]] as 'the richest author that ever grazed the common of literature.'&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Campbell, John (1708-1775)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Candid and impartial considerations on the nature of the sugar trade; the comparative importance of the British and French islands in the West-Indies- with the value and consequence of St. Lucia and (14780319154).jpg|thumb|''Candid and impartial considerations on the nature of the sugar trade'', by John Campbell.]]

==Life==
He was the son of a Campbell of [[Glenlyon]], captain in a regiment of horse, and was born at [[Edinburgh]] on 8 March 1708. At the age of five he was taken to Windsor by his mother, originally of that town, and educated under the direction of an uncle, who placed him as a clerk in an attorney's office. He left the law for literature, in the 1730s.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

In 1754 the [[University of Glasgow]] conferred on him the degree of LL.D. In March 1765 he was appointed his majesty's agent for the [[Province of Georgia]], and held the office until his death. He died on 28 December 1775, having received in the preceding year from the [[Empress Catherine of Russia]] a present of her portrait.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

==Early works==
Campbell produced at the age of 28 a ''Military History of the late Prince Eugene of Savoy and the late John, Duke of Marlborough … illustrated with variety of copper-plates of battles, sieges, plans, &amp;c., carefully engraved by [[Claude Du Bosc]]'', issued without the compiler's name in 1736. In compiling it Campbell used the [[Marquis de Quincy]]'s ''Histoire Militaire du règne de Louis Quatorze'', and the works of [[Jean Dumont (publicist)|Jean Dumont]] and [[Jean Rousset de Missy]] on [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]. In 1734 appeared, under Campbell's name, ''A View of the Changes to which the Trade of Great Britain to Turkey and Italy will be exposed if Naples and Sicily fall into the hands of the Spaniards''. Campbell suggested that the [[Two Sicilies]] should be handed over to the [[Elector of Bavaria]].&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

His first major original work was ''The Travels and Adventures of Edward Bevan, Esq., formerly a merchant in London'' (1739), fictitious autobiography in the style of [[Daniel Defoe]]. The description given in it by three Arab brothers (pp.&amp;nbsp;327–8) of a strayed camel, which they had never seen, may have suggested to [[Voltaire]] the sdescription of the dog and horse of the queen and king of Babylon in ''[[Zadig]]'' (1746). In 1739, too, appeared Campbell's ''Memoirs of the Bashaw Duke de Ripperda'' (second edition 1750).&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

==The "Universal History"==
Campbell began to contribute to the (Ancient) ''Universal History'' (1740–1744). Only the ''Cosmogony'' section is assigned to him by the ''[[Biographia Britannica]]'', but in the list of the writers communicated by [[John Swinton (1703–1777)|John Swinton]] to [[Samuel Johnson]] the ''Cosmogony'' is attributed to [[George Sale]], and the ''History of the Persians and the Constantinopolitan Empire'' to Campbell. To the ''Modern Universal History'' he contributed the histories of the Portuguese, Dutch, French, Swedish, Danish, and Ostend settlements in the East Indies; and histories of Spain, Portugal, Algarves, Navarre; and that of France from [[Clovis I]] to the year 1656.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

==Further works==
In 1741 the appeared Campbell's ''Concise History of Spanish America'' (second edition 1755), and in 1742 ''A Letter to a Friend in the Country on the Publication of Thurloe's State Papers'', in which [[John Thurloe]]'s then newly issued folios were reviewed. In the same year were published vols. i. and ii. of ''The Lives of the Admirals and other Eminent British Seamen''; and the two remaining volumes appeared in 1744. The work was translated into German, and three other editions of it were published in Campbell's lifetime. After his death there were several more, with continuations, an abridgement appearing in 1870.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

In 1743 appeared anonymously Campbell's English version, with copious annotations, of the Latin work of [[Johann Heinrich Cohausen]], ''Hermippus Redivivus; or, the Sage's Triumph over Old Age and the Grave''. It reached a third edition in 1771. In 1743 also appeared his translation from the Dutch, ''The True Interest and Political Maxims of the Republic of Holland.'' The original was ascribed wrongly to [[Johan de Witt|John de Witt]]; Campbell added memoirs of Cornelius and John de Witt.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

In 1744 was published Campbell's enlarged edition of [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]]'s ''Collection of Voyages and Travels'' (1702–05), ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca''. In the ''Account of the European Settlements in America'', attributed to [[William Burke (author)|William Burke]] and [[Edmund Burke]], the author expresses his obligations to this colossal work. A new edition in numbers was completed in 1749.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

To Campbell has been generally ascribed the recast (1744) of ''The Shepherd of Banbury's Rules to judge of the Changes of the Weather'', by "John Claridge, shepherd", first issued in 1670, and popular in rural districts. Little more than a few words of the original title remained in the recast, which was frequently reprinted into the nineteenth century. It attempted to base on principles the weather forecasts of the alleged Banbury shepherd.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

==Periodicals==
To the first ''[[Biographia Britannica]]'', the issue of which in weekly numbers began in 1745, Campbell's contributions, signed E. and X., were copious; but they ceased with the publication of vol. iv. Among them were biographies of members of noble British families. In 1750 there appeared, mainly reprinted from a periodical, 'The Museum,' his work ''The Political State of Europe'', which went through six editions in his lifetime, and gave him a wide reputation. It consisted of summaries of the history of the most prominent European states, with remarks on their international relations, and on the policy of their rulers and governments.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

==Later works==
''A Full and Particular Description of the Highlands of Scotland, its Situation and Produce, the Manners and Customs of the Natives'' (1752) contained a highly coloured account of the highlanders and of the resources of the Scottish Highlands. After the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]], 1763, he wrote, at [[Lord Bute]]'s request, a ''Description and History of the new Sugar Islands in the West Indies'', to show the value of those which had been ceded by the French at the close of the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

In 1774 appeared his last work, ''A Political Survey of Great Britain, being a series of reflections on the situation, lands, inhabitants, revenues, colonies, and commerce of the island'' (2 vols. London, 1774). It mentions projects for the construction of harbours, the opening up of new communications by road and canal, and the introduction of new industries. Campbell proposed that the state should buy up all the waste lands of the country and develop their latent resources, arable and pastoral. Many years had been spent in its preparation, and some of the original subscribers were dead before it appeared.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

The memoir of Campbell in [[Andrew Kippis]]'s ''Biographia Britannica'' gives a list including further writings.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

Juansher was a husband of a niece of [[Archil of Kakheti]], to whom a note in the text of the Queen Anne and Queen Mary codices of the ''[[Georgian Chronicles]]'' attributes the work "The Life of King Vakhtang Gorgasali" which covers the history of Iberia from the reign of [[Vakhtang I of Iberia|Vakhtang I]] (c. 447–502/522) down to the period of Archil (c. 736–786). This attribution remains problematic, however, and some modern scholars have suggested, though controversially, that the bulk of this work was, in fact, authored by the 11th-century chronicler [[Leonti Mroveli]], while the author of its untitled continuation, also ascribed to Juansher, is conventionally referred to as Pseudo-Juansher.&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;Rapp, Stephen H.

'''Jörg Baberowski''' (born 24 March 1961 in [[Radolfzell]] am Bodensee) is a German historian and Professor of Eastern European History at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. He is regarded as one of the world's foremost experts on the history of [[Stalinism]], particularly Stalinist violence, [[genocide]] and terror against the peoples of Eastern and Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3sat.de/page/?source=/ard/buehler/181825/index.html Wohin steuert Russland? Peter Voß fragt Jörg Baberowski], 3sat&lt;/ref&gt; Baberowski has also served as Director of the Historical Institute and Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy I at the Humboldt University.

==Background==

Baberowski was born in [[Radolfzell am Bodensee]], [[West Germany]]. He grew up in a Catholic working class and social democratic family. His grandfather was [[Poles|Polish]]; the Baberowski family thus belonged to the [[Ruhrpolen|Ruhr Polish]] minority, Polish immigrants to the rapidly industrializing areas of the [[Ruhr Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2017/16/joerg-baberowski-humboldt-universitaet-studenten-streit-rechtsextremismus/seite-2 Diese radikalen Studenten]&lt;/ref&gt; Baberowski's wife is Iranian-born and fled to Germany following the [[Iranian Revolution]].

==Career==
As a pupil he joined the [[Communist League of West Germany]], but later distanced himself from his earlier views. He studied history and philosophy at the [[University of Göttingen]] between 1982 and 1988, and was notably influenced by [[Manfred Hildermeier]]. As a student he also learned Russian, and he wrote his master's thesis on "political justice" in the last years of the [[Russian Empire]].

From 1989, he worked as a researcher in eastern European history at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] and earned his doctorate there in 1993 with a dissertation titled ''Autokratie und Justiz im Zarenreich'' ("Autocracy and Justice in Czarist Russia"). He joined the Institute of Eastern European History at Tübingen in 1993, and earned his [[Habilitation]] in 2000 with the dissertation ''Auf der Suche nach Eindeutigkeit'', which was published as a book titled ''Der Feind ist überall. Stalinismus im Kaukasus''. He has conducted archival studies in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Finland]], [[Russia]] and other countries.

He was appointed to a chair in Eastern European History at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 2001, before joining the Humboldt University as a Professor of Eastern European History in 2002. He has also been director of its Institute of History.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oeg.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/personen/1683840 Jörg Baberowski, Humboldt-Universität Berlin - Lehrstuhl Geschichte Osteuropas]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Leipzig Book Fair in 2012, he won the Leipzig Book Prize in the category of nonfiction/essay writing for his book ''Verbrannte Erde. Stalins Herrschaft der Gewalt''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hu-berlin.de/de/pr/pressemitteilungen/pm1203/pm_120315_01 Jörg Baberowski erhält Preis der Leipziger Buchmesse], Humboldt University press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baberowski is a member of the academic advisory boards of the [[Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial]], the [[Centre Against Expulsions]] and the [[Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship]], and of academic advisory boards of publications of the [[Goethe Institute]] and the [[15th January Committee]].

In response to the refugee crisis in Europe in 2015, Baberowski called for a more restrictive policy toward refugees in Germany and criticized German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s approach.&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Baberowski: ''Ungesteuerte Einwanderung Europa ist gar keine Wertegemeinschaft''. In: [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|FAZ.Net]], 14. September 2015 ([http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/joerg-baberowski-ueber-ungesteuerte-einwanderung-13800909.html online]). Simon Strauss: ''Jörg Baberowski über Gewalt „Natürlich kann auch ein Analphabet einen Asylgrund haben“'' In: FAZ.Net, 20. September 2015 ([http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/historiker-joerg-baberowski-im-interview-ueber-asyl-13810824.html online]). Jörg Baberowski: ''[http://www.nzz.ch/nzzas/nzz-am-sonntag/deutschland-verwandelt-sich-in-eine-tugend-republik-ld.2198 Der externe Standpunkt. Deutschland verwandelt sich in eine Tugend-Republik].'' In: ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' vom 27. September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Times Higher Education]]'' and ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' have noted that Baberowski has been the victim of [[harassment]] and [[stalking]] on the Internet by [[extremism|extremist]] far-left students who hero worship [[Leon Trotsky]] and who belong to the youth group of the far-left fringe [[Socialist Equality Party (Germany)|Socialist Equality Party]]; this happened in response to Baberowski having invited British historian [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] to lecture at his institute.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/professor-hunters-dig-in-on-the-digital-battlefield#survey-answer ‘Professor hunters’ dig in on the digital battlefield]," ''[[Times Higher Education]]'', 27 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/humboldt-universitaet-mobbing-trotzkistisch-13294937.html Mobbing, trotzkistisch]," ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Annual Report on the Protection of the Constitution]]'' published by German authorities, the Socialist Equality Party is an extremist organisation that is under observation by German authorities and listed as such in the chapter on far-left extremism.&lt;ref name="Verfassungsschutzbericht2017"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year=2018 |title=[[Annual Report on the Protection of the Constitution]] 2017 | chapter=Linksextremismus |url= |location= |publisher=[[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] |page=131 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4210">'''Lily E. Kay''' (May 22, 1947 – December 18, 2000) was a [[historian of science]] noted for her studies of [[molecular biology]].

==Education and early life==

Kay was born in Kraków, Poland, the daughter of concentration camp survivors. The family relocated to Israel and then, in 1960, to the United States. Kay graduated from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1969 and in 1986 earned her Ph.D from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in the history of science.&lt;ref&gt;"Lily Kay, 53, life sciences historian," MIT News, January 10, 2001, http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2001/kay-0110 (accessed 1 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching, research, and fellowships==

Prior to earning her Ph.D, Kay taught high school physics, worked as a biochemistry research associate at the University of Pittsburgh and a senior research assistant at the [[Salk Institute]]. While there, she studied the molecular biology of viruses.&lt;ref&gt;MIT obituary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kay spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow of the [[American Philosophical Society]]. She taught the history of science at the [[University of Chicago]] and then spent eight years at [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;MIT obituary.&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded a [[Guggenheim fellowship]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;"Lily E. Kay," John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation website, http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/lily-e-kay/ (accessed 1 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Kay then worked as an independent scholar and held guest appointments at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]]. At the time of her death, Kay was studying serial computing, artificial intelligence, and models of brain function.&lt;ref&gt;MIT obituary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==

In ''The Molecular Vision of Life'' (1993), Kay focused upon elite players in Pasadena, where she centered the creation of the field of molecular biology, and argued that "pure" science is influenced by pragmatism (and, in the case of molecular biology, the goals of eugenics).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bud, Review of ''The Molecular Vision of Life: Caltech, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Rise of the New Biology'', ''Technology and Culture'' Vol. 35, No. 4 (Oct 1994): 883-885, https://www.jstor.org/stable/3106520 (accessed 1 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman H. Horowitz]] of [[Caltech]], offended by both Kay's approach (he deemed it antireductionist, fundamentally political and antiscientific) and her characterization of scientists of his acquaintance (he lamented her failure to ask his personal opinion of these men), dismissed its historiographical value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1275794 | page=929 | volume=66 | issue=3 Pt 1 | journal=Biophysical Journal | title=Review of kay, The Molecular Vision of Life: Caltech, The Rockefeller Foundation, and the Rise of the New Biology|doi=10.1016/s0006-3495(94)80873-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joshua Lederberg]] and [[Linus Pauling]] were among those with positive opinions of the book, which has become a classic work.&lt;ref&gt;MIT obituary.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Who Wrote the Book of Life?'' (1999), Kay argued that information theory influenced research in molecular biology, as well as the rhetoric surrounding the field in the 1950s and 1960s. [[Solomon Golomb]] deemed it revisionist history, unconvincing based upon his professional experience, yet well-researched and accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Golomb, "Why Who Did What When," ''American Scientist'', January–February 2001, http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/why-who-did-what-when (accessed 1 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. C. Lewontin]] endorsed Kay's poststructuralist approach and her assertion of the ambivalent results of the deployment of metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Lewontin, "In the Beginning Was the Word," ''Science'' Vol. 291, No. 5507 (16 Feb 2001): 1263-1264, http://www.biosino.org/hgp/Science-Lewontin291%285507%291263.htm (accessed 1 July 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''list of Assyrian settlements''' in the Middle East subsequent to the [[Assyrian genocide]] in 1914. This list includes settlement of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] from Southeastern [[Turkey]] who left their ancient tribes in [[Hakkari province|Hakkari]], [[Sirnak province|Sirnak]] and [[Mardin province]] (which date from 3rd century AD)&lt;ref&gt;Wigram, W.A., "The Ashiret Highlands of Hakkari (Mesopotamia)," Royal Central Asian Society Journal, 1916, Vol. III, pg. 40. -- The Assyrians and their Neighbors (London, 1929)&lt;/ref&gt; due to torment, violence and displacement by the [[Ottomans]] in the [[First World War]]. Many Assyrians from [[Urmia]], [[Iran]] were also affected and as such have emigrated and settled in other towns. Resettling again occurred during the [[Simele massacre]] in [[northern Iraq]], perpetrated by the [[1936 Iraqi coup d'état|Iraqi military coup]] in the 1930s, with many fleeing to northeastern [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/books/aov.htm M.Y.A . Lilian, ''Assyrians Of The Van District During The Rule Of Ottoman Turks'', 1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern resettlement is located in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;Map of Assyrian villages in Iraq http://aina.org/maps/villagesbyyear.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syria]] and [[Iran]] in the cities of [[Baghdad]], [[Habbaniyah]], [[Kirkuk]], [[Duhok]], [[Al-Hasakah]], [[Tehran]] and [[Damascus]]. Few Assyrian settlements exist in Turkey today and also in the [[Caucasus]]. The exodus to the cities or towns of these aforementioned countries occurred between late 1910s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/reports/cacir.pdf Information on Assyrians in Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Gary N., From Urmia to the Stanislau: a cultural-historical-geography of Assyrian Christians in the Middle East and America (Davis, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Iraq War]] in 2003, a number of Assyrians in Baghdad relocated to [[Northern Iraq]], repopulating parts of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], in what they now call the "[[Assyrian homeland]]".&lt;ref&gt;Dalley, Stephanie (1993). "Nineveh After 612 BC." ''Alt-Orientanlische Forshchungen 20''. P.134.&lt;/ref&gt; Many others have immigrated to [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], especially in the late 20th century and [[21st century]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/maps/hakkarimap.png Assyrian villages in Hakkari Assyrian villages in Hakkari]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are a number of settlements on this list that have been abandoned due to persecution, conflict, and other causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Costa-Roberts|first1=Daniel|title=8 things you didn’t know about Assyrian Christians|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/8-things-didnt-know-assyrian-christians/|accessdate=6 July 2015|publisher=[[PBS]]|date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrians immigrated to Syria during the 1930s and 1940s, from [[Northern Iraq]], after they were slaughtered and displaced during the [[Simele Massacre]] perpetrated by the armed forces of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, J., "The Khabur Valley," Royal Central Asian Society Journal, 1947, pp. 144-149.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Assyrians in Syria did not have [[Syrian citizenship]] and title to their land until late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Betts, Robert Brenton, Christians in the Arab East (Atlanta, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lyndall Ryan''', {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100|FAHA}} (born 14 April 1943) is an Australian academic and historian. She has held positions in Australian Studies and [[Women's Studies]] at [[Griffith University]] and [[Flinders University]] and was Foundation [[Professor]] of Australian Studies and Head of School of Humanities at the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]], 1998–2005. She is currently Conjoint Professor in the Centre for the History of Violence at the University of Newcastle.

==Academic career==
Ryan completed a [[PhD]] at [[Macquarie University]] in 1975, her thesis was titled "Aborigines in Tasmania, 1800–1974 and their problems with the Europeans".

Ryan's book '' The Aboriginal Tasmanians'', first published in 1981, presented a critical interpretation of the early history of relations between [[Tasmanian Aborigines]] and white settlers in [[Tasmania]]. A second edition was published by Allen &amp; Unwin in 1996, in which she brought the story of the Tasmanian Aborigines in the 20th century up to date. Her work was later attacked by [[Keith Windschuttle]], thus drawing her into the "[[history wars]]". Windschuttle pointed to alleged discrepancies between Ryan's claims, her cited sources for the claims, and what the cited sources for the claims and the historical record actually reported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quadrant.org.au/blogs/history-wars/2011/04/inventing-massacre-stories&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan contested Windschuttle's claims in an essay entitled 'Who is the fabricator?' in Robert Manne's ''Whitewash: On Keith Windschuttle Fabrication of Aboriginal History'' published in 2003 and further addressed them in her book, ''Tasmanian Aborigines: A History Since 1803'', published in 2012.

In 2017, Ryan and her team at the University of Newcastle released a partially completed on-line map showing more than 150 massacre sites in Eastern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://c21ch.newcastle.edu.au/colonialmassacres/map.php|title=Centre For 21st Century Humanities|website=c21ch.newcastle.edu.au|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within 6 months the site had received more than sixty thousand visitors and has received wide coverage in Australia and also internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/mapping-massacres|title=The Mapping of Massacres|last=Dovey|first=Ceridwen|date=2017-12-07|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The on-line tool records details and approximate locations of massacres and provides sources of corroborating evidence. The map is an important step in acknowledging the extensive violence used against indigenous people in Australia's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newcastle.edu.au/newsroom/featured-news/mapping-the-massacres-of-australias-colonial-frontier|title=Mapping the massacres of Australia's colonial frontier|date=2017-07-05|website=www.newcastle.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, Ryan was elected a [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanities.org.au/2018/11/19/welcoming-28-newly-elected-fellows/|title=Welcoming our 28 newly elected Fellows - Australian Academy of the Humanities|website=www.humanities.org.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Michael Eliot Howard''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OM|CH|CBE|MC|FBA|FRHistS}} (born 29 November 1922) is a British [[military history|military historian]], formerly [[Chichele Professor of the History of War]], Emeritus Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]], [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] at [[Oxford University]], Robert A. Lovett Professor of Military and Naval History at [[Yale University]] and founder of the [[Department of War Studies, King's College London]].&lt;ref name="Who's Who"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.20910|title=Howard, Sir Michael (Eliot), (born 29 Nov. 1922), Emeritus Professor of Modern History, University of Oxford, since 1989|journal=[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard has been described in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' as "Britain's greatest living historian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/03cb60c8-1950-11e3-80ec-00144feab7de.html|title= Max Hastings’ brief history of war|publisher= [[The Financial Times]]|author= [[Max Hastings]]|date = 2013-09-13|accessdate=2013-09-14|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Howard was born on 29 November 1922 in the village of [[Ashmore]] in [[Dorset]]. He was the youngest son of Geoffrey Howard and Edith ({{nee|Edinger}}). He was educated at [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree in 1946, which was later promoted to [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] (MA) in 1948.&lt;ref name="Who's Who"/&gt;

Howard joined the [[British Army]] and was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Coldstream Guards]] on 4 December 1942. He was given the [[service number]] 253901.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35880 |date=26 January 1943 |page=531 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He fought in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], serving with the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, coming ashore during the [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|landings at Salerno]] in September 1943. On 27 January 1944, during the [[Battle of Monte Cassino|First Battle of Monte Cassino]], he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] (MC) "in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36349 |date=25 January 1944 |page=518 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Oxford, Howard began his teaching career at [[King's College London]], where he created the [[Department of War Studies, King's College London|Department of War Studies]]. From his position at King's he was one of the Britain's most influential in developing strategic studies as a discipline that brought together government, military, and academia to think about defence and national security more broadly and deeply than had been done before.

He was one of the founders of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. From his family, education, and service in the Guards, he had extensive connections at the higher levels of British society, and he worked them astutely to further his intellectual goals. He had close connections in the Labour Party but was also consulted as an advisor by [[Margaret Thatcher]].

==Historical writing==
Howard is best known for expanding military history beyond the traditional campaigns and battles accounts to include wider discussions about the sociological significance of war. In his account of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71, Howard looked at how the Prussian and French armies reflected the social structure of the two nations. He has also been a leading interpreter of the writings of the German military thinker [[Carl von Clausewitz]], including preparing the leading translation of ''[[On War]]'' with the American historian [[Peter Paret]].

In addition, in both his inaugural and concluding lectures as Regius Professor, and in his popular and influential ''War in European History'', Howard has stressed the difference between traditional military history, which seeks to identify easily applicable lessons for the present from the history of past wars and military campaigns, and his own approach, which stresses the uniqueness of the historical past and the impossibility of deriving such lessons to guide modern strategic and tactical choices.

In 1985, he delivered the [[Huizinga Lecture]] in the Dutch city of [[Leiden]], under the title: ''1945: End of an Era''.&lt;ref&gt;The Lecture is published in a Dutch translation, as: ''1945: Einde van een tijdperk?'' (1986) Amsterdam: Bert Bakker. {{ISBN|90-351-0352-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard helped found the [[Department of War Studies, King's College London|Department of War Studies]] and the [[Liddell Hart]] Centre for Military Archives at [[King's College London]]. He is currently president emeritus of the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], which he also helped to establish, and a fellow of the [[British Academy]].

==Awards and honours==

Mi’kmaq militias were made up of [[Mi’kmaq]] [[warriors]] ([[Smáknisk]]) who worked independently as well as in coordination with the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]], French and [[Acadian]] forces throughout the colonial period to defend their homeland [[Mi’kma’ki]] against the [[England|English]] (the [[Great Britain|British]] after 1707).{{efn|Many of the Acadians and Mi'kmaq people were [[métis]].

==16th century==

=== Battle at Bae de Bic ===
According to [[Jacques Cartier]], the Battle at [[Bic National Park|Bae de Bic]] happened in the spring of 1534, 100 Iroquois warriors massacred a group of 200 Mi’kmaq camped on Massacre Island in the St. Lawrence River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William Carson |last=Woods |title=The Isle of the Massacre |location=Toronto |publisher=Publishers Syndicate |date=1901 |url=https://archive.org/stream/isleofmassacrefo00wooduoft#page/n8/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bae de Bic was an annual gathering place for the Mi’kmaq along the St. Lawrence. Mi’kmaq scouting parties notified the village of the Iroquois attack the evening before the morning attack. They evacuated 30 of the infirm and elderly and about 200 Mi’kmaq left their encampment on the shore and retreated to an island in the bay. They took cover in a cave on the island and covered the entrance with branches. The Iroquois arrived at the village in the morning. Finding it vacated, they divided into search parties but failed to find the Mi’kmaq until the morning of the next day.

The Mi’kmaq warriors defended the tribe against the first Iroquois assault. Initially, after many had been wounded on both sides, with the rising tide, the Mi’kmaq were able to repulse the assault and the Iroquois retreated to the mainland. The Mikmaq prepared a fortification on the island in preparation for the next assault at low tide. The Iroquois were again repulsed and retreated to the mainland with the rising tide. By the following morning, the tide was again low and the Iroquois made their final approach. They had prepared arrows that carried fire which burned down the fortification and wiped out the Mi’kmaq. Twenty Iroquois were killed and thirty wounded in the battle. The Iroquois divided into two companies to return to their canoes on the Bouabouscache River.&lt;ref name="Cartier, second voyage, CL, IX"&gt;Cartier, second voyage, CL, IX&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James Phinney |last=Baxter |title=A Memoir of Jacques Cartier, Sieur de Limoilou, his Voyages to the St. Lawrence, a Bibliography and a Facsimile of the Manuscript of 1534 |location=New York |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. |date=1906 |p=174 |url=https://archive.org/stream/memoirofjacquesc01baxt#page/174/mode/2up/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cacouna.net"&gt;[http://cacouna.net/micmaqMassacre_e.htm Île du Massacre, Rimouski, QC : Battle between Mi'kmaq and Iroquois c. 1534] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119051948/http://cacouna.net/micmaqMassacre_e.htm |date=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle at Bouabouscache River ===

Just prior to Battle at Bae de Bic, the Iroquois warriors had left their canoes and hid their provisions on the Bouabousche River, which the Mi’kmaq scouts had discovered and recruited assistance from 25 Maliseet warriors. The Mi’kmaq and Maliseet militia ambushed the first company of Iroquois to arrive at the site. They killed ten and wounded five of the Iroquois warriors before the second company of Iroquois arrived and the Mi’kmaq/ Maliseet militia retreated to the woods unharmed.

The Mi'kmaq/ Maliseet militia had stolen most of the Iroquois canoes. Leaving twenty wounded behind at the site, 50 Iroquois went to find their hidden provisions. Unable to find their supplies, at the end of the day they returned to the camp, finding that the 20 wounded soldiers that had stayed behind had been slaughtered by the Mi’kmaq/ Maliseet militia. The following morning, the 38 Iroquois warriors left their camp, killing twelve of their own wounded who would not be able to survive the long journey back to their village. Ten of the Mi’kmaq/ Maliseet stayed with the stolen canoes canoes and provisions while the remaining 15 pursued the Iroquois. The Mi’kmaq/ Maliseet militia pursued the Iroquois for three days, killing eleven of the wounded Iroquois stragglers.&lt;ref name="Cartier, second voyage, CL, IX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cacouna.net"/&gt;

=== Battle at Riviere Trois Pistoles ===

Shortly after the Battle at Bouabouscache River, the retreating Iroquois set up camp on the Riviere Trois Pistoles to build canoes to return to their village. An Iroquois hunting party was sent to hunt for food. The Mi’kmaq/ Maliseet militia killed the hunting party. The Iroquois went to find their missing hunting party and were ambushed by the Mi’kmaq/ Maliseet militia. They killed nine of the Iroquois, leaving 29 warriors who retreated to their camp on Riviere Trois Pistoles. The Mi’kmaq/ Maliseet militia divided into two companies and attacked the remaining Iroquois warriors. The battle left 3 Maliseet warriors dead and many others wounded. The Mi’kmaq/ Maliseet militia was victorious, however, killing all but six of the Iroquois, whom they took prisoner and later tortured and killed.&lt;ref name="cacouna.net"/&gt;

=== Kwedech-Mi'kmaq War ===
Tradition indicates that there was war in the 16th century between the Kwedech (the St. Lawrence Iroquois) and the Mi'kmaq. The great Mi'kmaq chief Ulgimoo led his people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Silas Tertius |last=Rand |chapter=Chapter LI: The History of the Celebrated Chief Ulgimoo |title=Legends of the Micmacs |date=1894 |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co |p=294 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/cihm_12305#page/n349/mode/2up |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict was eventually settled through a peace treaty after the Mi'kmaq were successful in removing the Kwedech out of the Maritimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Silas Tertius |last=Rand |title=The History of the Celebrated Chief Ulgimoo |journal=Cape Breton's Magazine |p=38 |issue=28 |date=June 1981 |url=http://capebretonsmagazine.com/modules/publisher/item.php?itemid=1193}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Rand|1894|p=207|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/cihm_12305#page/n261/mode/2up Chapter XXVII: Kwendech War Renewed]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S.T. |last=Rand |chapter=The Legends of the Micmacs |title=The New Dominion Monthly |date=1871 |location=Montreal |publisher=John Dougall &amp; Son |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdMhAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA262 |p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invisiblebooks.com/Rand2.pdf#page=168 p.46] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930083633/http://www.invisiblebooks.com/Rand2.pdf#page=168 |date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invisiblebooks.com/Rand2.pdf#page=168 p.51] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930083633/http://www.invisiblebooks.com/Rand2.pdf#page=168 |date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century==
A subgroup of Mi'kmaq who lived in New England were known as [[Tarrantine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bourque |first1=Bruce J. |last2=Whitehead |first2=Ruth Holmes |date=Autumn 1985 |title=Tarrentines and the introduction of European trade goods in the Gulf of Maine |journal=Ethnohistory |volume=32 |issue=4 |pp=327–341 |jstor=481893 |doi=10.2307/481893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Tadeusz |editor-last=Piotrowski |title=The Indian Heritage of New Hampshire and Northern New England |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |p=12 |date=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYH8tU0IO3gC&amp;pg=PA12 |isbn=978-0-7864-1098-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tarrantines sent 300 warriors to kill [[Nanepashemet]] and his wife in 1619 at Mystic Fort. The remaining family had been sent off to safe haven. Nanapashemet's death ended the [[Wampanoag|Massachusetts Federation]].&lt;ref name="salemdeeds.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Raids in New England and Essex County &amp; Colonial Militia in Indian Wars |website=Native American Deeds |publisher=South Essex District Registry of Deeds |url=http://www.salemdeeds.com/nativeamericandeeds/focuspoints5.aspx |access-date=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Penobscot-Tarrantine War ===
Before 1620, the Penobscot-Tarrantine War (1614–1615) (Tarrantine being the New England term for Mi'kmaq) happened in current day Maine, in which the Pawtucket Tribe supported the former. This led later to retaliatory raids by the Tarrantines on the Pawtucket and Agawam (Ipswich) Tribes.&lt;ref name="salemdeeds.com"/&gt;

In 1633 Tarrantines raid the camp of [[Chief Masconomet]] at [[Agawam, Massachusetts|Agawam]] in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]].&lt;ref name="salemdeeds.com"/&gt;

=== King Philip's War ===
The first documented warfare between the Mi’kmaq and the British was during the [[First Abenaki War]] (the Maine/ Acadia theatre of [[King Philip's War]]), which was the [[Battle off Port La Tour (1677)]]. In the wake of King Philip's War, the Mi'kmaq became members of the ''Wapnáki'' ([[Wabanaki Confederacy]]), an alliance with four other [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-language nations: the [[Abenaki]], [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]], [[Passamaquoddy]], and [[Maliseet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Harald E. L. |last=Prins |title=Storm Clouds over Wabanakiak: Confederacy Diplomacy until Dummer's Treaty (1727) |conference=The Atlantic Policy Congress of First Nations Chiefs |location=Amherst, Nova Scotia |url=http://www.wabanaki.com/Harald_Prins.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The allied tribes occupied the territory which the French named [[Acadia]]. The tribes ranged from present-day northern and eastern New England in the United States to the Maritime Provinces of Canada. At the time of contact with the French (late 16th century), they were expanding from their maritime base westward along the Gaspé Peninsula/[[St. Lawrence River]] at the expense of [[Iroquoian]]-speaking tribes. The Míkmaq name for this peninsula was ''Kespek'' (meaning "last-acquired").}}

The Wabanaki Confederacy allied with French colonists in [[Acadia]]. Over a period of seventy-five years, during six wars in Mi'kma'ki (Acadia and Nova Scotia), the Mi'kmaq fought to keep the British from taking over the region. The first war where there is evidence of widespread participation of the Mi’kmaq militias was [[King William's War]].

===King William's War===
[[File:Maliseet and Mi'kmaw "attack on the settlement".png|thumb|300px|Maliseet and Mi'kmaw "attack on the [Maine] settlement" (c. 1690)]]
During [[King William's War]], the Mi'kmaq militia participated in defending against the British migration toward Mi’kmaki. They fought, with the support of their Wabanaki and French allies, the British along the [[Kennebec River]] in southern Maine which was the natural boundary between Acadia and New England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William D. |last=Williamson |author-link=William D.

They joined the New France expedition against present-day [[Bristol, Maine]] (the [[Siege of Pemaquid (1689)]]), [[Raid on Salmon Falls|Salmon Falls]] and present-day [[Battle of Fort Loyal|Portland, Maine]]. Mi'kmaq tortured the British prisoners taken during these conflicts and the [[Battle of Fort Loyal]].

In the lead up to this battle in Fundy Bay, on July 5, 140 natives (Mi'kmaq and Maliseet), with [[Jacques Testard de Montigny]] and Chevalier, from their location of Manawoganish island, ambushed the crews of four English vessels.

During [[Queen Anne's War]], the Mi'kmaq militias participated again in defending Mi’kmaki against the migration of the British into the region. Again, they made numerous raids along the Acadia/ New England border.

During [[Queen Anne's War]], the Conquest of Acadia (1710) was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713. Acadia was defined as mainland-Nova Scotia by the French. Present-day New Brunswick and most of Maine remained contested territory, while New England conceded Île St Jean and Île Royale; present-day Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton respectively, as French territory. On the latter island, the French established a fortress at [[Louisbourg]] to guard the sea approaches to Quebec.  In 1712, the Mi'kmaq captured over twenty New England fishing vessels off the coast of Nova Scotia.{{sfnp|Penhallow|1859|p=77|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/historyofwarsofn00penh#page/77/mode/1up/search/cape]}}

In 1715 the Mi'kmaq were told that the British now claimed their ancient territory by the Treaty of Utrecht, in which the Mi'kmaq were not involved. They formally complained to the French commander at Louisbourg about the French king transferring the sovereignty of their nation when he did not possess it. They were only then informed that the French had claimed legal possession of their country for a century, on account of laws decreed by kings in Europe.

Native people saw no reason to accept British pretensions to rule Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name="Mission to the Micmac"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mission to the Micmac |last=Reid |first=John G. |work=Beaver |id=00057517 |date=Oct–Nov 1990 |volume=70 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an attempt by the British after the war to settle outside of Mi’kmaq accommodation of the British trading posts at Canso and Annapolis.

==== Raid on Georgetown ====
On September 10, 1722, in conjunction with Father Rale at Norridgewock, 400 or 500 [[Saint-François-du-Lac, Quebec|St. Francis]] ([[Odanak, Quebec]]) and Mi'kmaq Indians fell upon Georgetown (present-day [[Arrowsic, Maine]]).{{sfnp|Penhallow|1859|p=93|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/historyofwarsofn00penh#page/93/mode/1up/search/cape]}} Captain Penhallow discharged musketry from a small guard, wounding three of the Indians and killing another. This defense gave the inhabitants of the village time to retreat into the fort. In full possession of the undefended village, the Indians killed fifty head of cattle and set fire to twenty-six houses outside the fort. The Indians then assaulted the fort, killing one New Englander.{{sfnp|Williamson|1832|p=119}} Georgetown was burned.

That night Col. Walton and Capt. Harman arrived with thirty men, to which were joined about forty men from the fort under Captains Penhallow and Temple.  The combined force of seventy men attacked the natives but were overwhelmed by their numbers.  The New Englanders then retreated back into the fort. Viewing further attacks on the fort as useless, the Indians eventually retired up the river.{{sfnp|Williamson|1832|p=119}}

During their return to Norridgewock the natives attacked Fort Richmond.{{sfnp|Williamson|1832|p=119}}  Fort Richmond was attacked in a three-hour [[siege]]. Houses were burned and cattle slain, but the fort held. Brunswick and other settlements near the mouth of the Kennebec were burned.

During the 1724 Northeast Coast Campaign, assisted by the Mi'kmaq from Cape Sable Island, the natives also engaged in a naval campaign.&lt;ref name="Tod Scott 1781 pp. 1-18"/&gt; In just a few weeks they had captured 22 vessels, killing 22 New Englanders and taking more prisoner.{{sfnp|Williamson|1832|p=127}} They also made an unsuccessful siege of St. George's Fort in Thomaston, Maine.

In early July 1724 a militia of sixty Mikmaq and Maliseets raided Annapolis Royal. They killed and scalped a sergeant and a private, wounded four more soldiers, and terrorized the village.

As a result of the raid, three blockhouses were built to protect the town. The Acadian church was moved closer to the fort so that it could be more easily monitored.{{sfnp|Dunn|2004|pp=124–125}}

The treaty that ended the war marked a significant shift in European relations with the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet. For the first time a European Empire formally acknowledged that its dominion over Nova Scotia would have to be negotiated with the region's indigenous inhabitants.

=== King George's War ===
[[File:Louisbourg assiegee en 1745.jpg|thumb|left|[[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)]] by [[Peter Monamy]]]]
News of war declarations reached the French [[Fortress Louisbourg|fortress at Louisbourg]] first, on May 3, 1744, and the forces there wasted little time in beginning hostilities, which would become known as [[King George's War]]. Within a week of the arrival of the news of war a military expedition to Canso was agreed upon, and on May 23 a flotilla left Louisbourg harbour. In this same month British Captain David Donahue of the Resolution took prisoner the chief of the Mi'kmaq people of Ile Royale [[Jacques Pandanuques]] with his family to Boston and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |first=Micheline D. |last=Johnson |title=Padanuques, Jacques |volume=3 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/padanuques_jacques_3E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donahue used the same strategy of posing as a French ship to entrap Chief Pandanuques as he does in the [[Naval battle off Tatamagouche]], after which Donahue was tortured and killed by the Mi'kmaq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antoine Simon |last=Malliard |title=An Account Of The Customs And Manners Of The Micmakis And Maricheets Savage Nations, Now Dependent On The Government Of Cape-Breton |location=London |publisher=S.

Annapolis had received news of the war declaration, and was somewhat prepared when the Indians began besieging [[Fort Anne]]. Lacking heavy weapons, the Indians withdrew after a few days. Then, in mid-August, a larger French force arrived before Fort Anne, but was also unable to mount an effective attack or siege against the garrison, which was relieved by the New England company of [[Gorham's Rangers]]. Gorham led his native rangers in a surprise raid on a nearby Mi'kmaq encampment.

==== Naval battle off Tatamagouche ====
[[File:BattleOfTatamagoucheMonument.jpg|thumb|Naval Battle off Tatamagouche]]
Many Mi'kmaq warriors and French Officer [[Paul Marin de la Malgue]] were thwarted from helping to protect Louisbourg by Captain Donahew, who defeated them in the [[Naval battle off Tatamagouche]] (and had earlier killed the Mi'kmaq chief of Cape Breton). In 1745, British colonial forces conducted the [[Siege of Port Toulouse]] (St. Peter's) and then [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|captured Fortress Louisbourg]] after a siege of six weeks. Weeks after the fall of Louisbourg, Donahew and Fones again engaged Marin, who was now nearing the Strait of Canso. Donahew and 11 of his men put ashore and were immediately surrounded by 300 Indians. The captain and five of his men were slain and the remaining six were taken prisoner. The Indians were said to have cut open Donahew's chest, sucked his blood, then eaten parts of him and his five companions. This tale significantly heightened the sense of gloom and frustration settling over the fortress. On July 19, the 12-gun provincial cruiser of Donavan’s the Resolution sailed slowly into the harbour with her colours flying at half-mast.

=== Father Le Loutre's War ===

Despite the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq. To prevent the establishment of Protestant settlements in the region, Mi'kmaq raided the early British settlements of present-day [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]] (1715) and [[Canso, Nova Scotia|Canso]] (1720).

To guard against Mi'kmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|(Citadel Hill)]] (1749), Bedford ([[Fort Sackville (Nova Scotia)|Fort Sackville]]) (1749), Dartmouth (1750), [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]] (1753) and [[Lawrencetown, Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]] (1754).{{sfnp|Grenier|2008}} There were numerous Mi'kmaq and Acadian raids on these villages such as the [[Raid on Dartmouth (1751)]].

(A British fort already existed at the other major Acadian centre of [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia]].

==== Siege of Grand Pre ====
{{main|Siege of Grand Pre}}
Two months later, on November 27, 1749, 300 Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, and Acadians attacked Fort Vieux Logis, recently established by the British in the Acadian community of Grand Pre. The fort was under the command of Captain Handfield. The Native and Acadian militia killed the sentrys (guards) who were firing on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brebner |first=John Bartlet |date=1973 |title=New England's Outpost: Acadia before the Conquest of Canada |publisher=B.

After the British soldiers were captured, the native and Acadian militias made several attempts over the next week to lay siege to the fort before breaking off the engagement. [[John Gorham (military officer)|Gorham’s Rangers]] was sent to relieve the fort. When he arrived, the militia had already departed with the prisoners. The prisoners spent several years in captivity before being ransomed.{{sfnp|Murdoch|1865|pp=166-167|loc=[http://www.ourroots.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3925381]}}{{sfnp|Faragher|2005|p=262}}{{sfnp|Griffiths|2005|p=392}}{{sfnp|Grenier|2008|p=153}}&lt;ref name="Fort Vieux Logis"/&gt; There was no fighting over the winter months, which was common in frontier warfare.

==== Battle at St. Croix ====
{{main|Battle at St. Croix}}
[[File:BattleHillStCroixNovaScotia.JPG|300px|thumb|left|"Battle Hill", [[St. Croix, Nova Scotia]]]]
The following spring, on March 18, 1750, John Gorham and his Rangers left Fort Sackville (at present day [[Bedford, Nova Scotia]]), under orders from Governor Cornwallis, to march to Piziquid (present day [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]]). Gorham's mission was to establish a blockhouse at Piziquid, which became [[Fort Edward (Nova Scotia)|Fort Edward]], and to seize the property of Acadians who had participated in the [[Siege of Grand Pre]].

Arriving at about noon on March 20 at the Acadian village of Five Houses beside the [[St. Croix River (Nova Scotia)|St. Croix River]], Gorham and his men found all the houses deserted. Seeing a group of Mi’kmaq hiding in the bushes on the opposite shore, the Rangers opened fire. The skirmish deteriorated into a siege, with Gorham’s men taking refuge in a sawmill and two of the houses. During the fighting, the Rangers suffered three wounded, including Gorham, who sustained a bullet in the thigh. As the fighting intensified, a request was sent back to Fort Sackville for reinforcements.{{sfnp|Grenier|2008|pp=154–155}}

Responding to the call for assistance on March 22, Governor Cornwallis ordered Captain Clapham’s and Captain St. Loe’s Regiments, equipped with two field guns, to join Gorham at Piziquid. The additional troops and artillery turned the tide for Gorham and forced the Mi’kmaq to withdraw.{{sfnp|Murdoch|1865|p=174|loc=[http://www.ourroots.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3925389]}}

Gorham proceeded to present-day Windsor and forced Acadians to dismantle their church—Notre Dame de l'Assomption—so that Fort Edward could be built in its place.

==== Raids on Halifax ====

There were four raids on [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] during the war. The first raid happened in October 1750, while in the woods on peninsular Halifax, Mi'kmaq scalped two British people and took six prisoner: Cornwallis' gardener, his son were tortured and scalped. The Mi'kmaq buried the son while the gardener's body was left behind and the other six persons were taken prisoner to Grand Pre for five months.{{sfnp|Wilson|1751|p=13}} Another author, Thomas Akins, puts the month of this raid in July and writes that there were six British attacked, two were scalped and four were taken prisoner and never seen again.{{sfnp|Akins|1895|p=334}} Shortly after this raid, Cornwallis learned that the Mi'kmaq had received payment from the French at Chignecto for five prisoners taken at Halifax as well as prisoners taken earlier at Dartmouth and Grand Pre.{{sfnp|Murdoch|1866|p=183}}

In 1751, there were two attacks on blockhouses surrounding Halifax. Mi'kmaq attacked the North Blockhouse (located at the north end of Joseph Howe Drive) and killed the men on guard. Mi'kmaq also attacked near the South Blockhouse (located at the south end of Joseph Howe Drive), at a sawmill on a stream flowing out of Chocolate Lake into the [[Northwest Arm]]. They killed two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piers |first=Harry |title=The Evolution of the Halifax Fortress, 1749-1928 |url=http://www.ourroots.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=6086 |location=Halifax, |publisher=Public Archives of Nova Scotia |id=Pub. #7 |date=1947 |p=6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102121555/http://www.ourroots.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=6086 |archivedate=2012-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Landry|2007|p=370}}

There were six raids on Dartmouth during this time period. In July 1750, the Mi'kmaq killed and scalped 7 men who were at work in Dartmouth.{{sfnp|Akins|1895|p=334}}

In August 1750, 353 people arrived on the Alderney and began the town of Dartmouth. The town was laid out in the autumn of that year.{{sfnp|Akins|1895|p=27}} The following month, on September 30, 1750, Dartmouth was attacked again by the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] and five more residents were killed.{{sfnp|Grenier|2008|p=159}} In October 1750 a group of about eight men went out "to take their diversion; and as they were fowling, they were attacked by the Indians, who took the whole prisoners; scalped ...

The following spring, on March 26, 1751, the Mi'kmaq attacked again, killing fifteen settlers and wounding seven, three of which would later die of their wounds. They took six captives, and the regulars who pursued the Mi'kmaq fell into an ambush in which they lost a sergeant killed. Two days later, on March 28, 1751, Mi'kmaq abducted another three settlers.{{sfnp|Grenier|2008|p=160}}

Two months later, on May 13, 1751, Broussard led sixty [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] and Acadians to attack Dartmouth again, in what would be known as the [[Raid on Dartmouth (1751)|"Dartmouth Massacre"]].{{sfnp|Akins|1895|pp=27–28}} Broussard and the others killed twenty settlers—mutilating men, women, children and babies—and took more prisoner.{{sfnp|Grenier|2008|p=159}}{{efn|Cornwallis' official report mentioned that four settlers were killed and six soldiers taken prisoner.

Upon returning to their camp the next day they found the Mi'kmaq had also raided their camp and taken a prisoner. All the settlers were scalped by the Mi'kmaq.

In 1752, the Mi'kmaq attacks on the British along the coast, both east and west of Halifax, were frequent. Those who were engaged in the fisheries were compelled to stay on land because they were the primary targets.{{sfnp|Akins|1895|p=34}} In early July, New Englanders killed and scalped two Mi'kmaq girls and one boy off the coast of Cape Sable ([[Port La Tour, Nova Scotia]]).{{sfnp|Murdoch|1866|p=209}} In August, at [[St. Peter's, Nova Scotia]], Mi'kmaq seized two schooners—the ''Friendship'' from Halifax and the ''Dolphin'' from New England—along with 21 prisoners who were captured and ransomed.{{sfnp|Murdoch|1866|p=209}}

On September 14, 1752, Governor [[Peregrine Hopson]] and the [[Nova Scotia Council]] negogiated the 1752 Peace Treaty with [[Jean-Baptiste Cope]]. (The treaty was signed officially in November 22, 1752.) Cope was unsuccessful in getting support for the treaty from other Mi'kmaq leaders. Cope burned the treaty six months after he signed it.{{sfnp|Plank|2001|pp=33-34}} Despite the collapse of peace on the eastern shore, the British did not formally renounce the Treaty of 1752 until 1756.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Stephen E. |title=1744–1763: Colonial Wars and Aboriginal Peoples |editor-first1=Phillip A. |editor-last1=Buckner |editor-first2=John |editor-last2=Reid |work=The Atlantic Region to Confederation: A History |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=1994 |p=138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5AHjGRigpYC&amp;pg=PA138 |isbn=0-8020-0553-5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Attack at Mocodome}}

On February 21, 1753, nine Mi'kmaq from Nartigouneche (present-day [[Antigonish, Nova Scotia]]) in canoes attacked a British vessel at [[Country Harbour, Nova Scotia]]. The vessel was from [[Canso, Nova Scotia]] and had a crew of four. The Mi'kmaq fired on them and drove them toward the shore. Other natives joined in and boarded the schooner, forcing them to run their vessel into an inlet. The Mi'kmaq killed and scalped two of the British and took two others captive. After seven weeks in captivity, on April 8, the two British prisoners killed six Mi'kmaq and managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ruth |last=Whitehead |title=The Old Man Told Us: Excerpts from Micmac History, 1500-1950 |publisher=Nimbus |edition=2nd |date=1991 |p=137 |isbn=978-0-9210-5483-2 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Patterson reports the attack happened on the coast between Country Harbour and Tor Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Stephen E. |title=Indian–White Relations in Nova Scotia, 1749–61: A Study in Political Interaction |editor-first1=Phillip A. |editor-last1=Buckner |editor-first2=Gail Grace |editor-last2=Campbell |editor-first3=David |editor-last3=Frank |work=The Acadiensis Reader: Atlantic Canada Before Confederation |date=1998 |p=97 |isbn=0-9191-0744-3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead reports the location was a little harbour to the westward of Torbay, "Martingo", "port of Mocodome".{{sfnp|Whitehead|1991|p=137}} Beamish Murdoch in ''An History of Nova-Scotia, or Acadie, Volume 1'' identifies Mocodome as present-day "Country Harbour".{{sfnp|Murdoch|1865|p=410}} The Mi'kmaq claimed the British schooner was accidentally shipwrecked and some of the crew drowned. They also indicated that two men died of illness while the other killed the six Mi'kmaq despite their hospitality. The ''French'' officials did not believe the Mi'kmaq account of events. The Mi'kmaq account of this attack was that the two English died of natural causes and the other two killed six of the Mi'kmaq for their scalps.

==== Attack at Jeddore ====
{{main|Attack at Jeddore}}
In response, on the night of April 21, under the leadership of Chief [[Jean-Baptiste Cope]] and the Mi'kmaq attacked another British schooner in a battle at sea off [[Jeddore, Nova Scotia]]. On board were nine British men and one Acadian (Casteel), who was the pilot. The Mi'kmaq killed and scalped the British and let the Acadian off at Port Toulouse, where the Mi'kmaq sank the schooner after looting it.{{sfnp|Whitehead|1991|p=137}}{{sfnp|Murdoch|1866|p=222}} In August 1752, the Mi'kmaq at Saint Peter's seized the schooners ''Friendship'' of Halifax and ''Dolphin'' of New England and took 21 prisoners who they held for ransom.{{sfnp|Murdoch|1866|p=209}}

In 1754, the British unilaterally established Lawrencetown. In late April 1754, Beausoleil and a large band of Mi'kmaq and Acadians left Chignecto for Lawrencetown. They arrived in mid-May and in the night open fired on the village. Beausoleil killed and scalped four British settlers and two soldiers. By August, as the raids continued, the residents and soldiers were withdrawn to Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Marshall. ''Heroes of the Acadian Resistance''. Formac. 2011. p. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1757, the settlers had to be withdrawn completely again from the settlement of [[Lawrencetown, Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]] because the number of Native raids eventually prevented settlers from leaving their houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Winthrop Pickard |last=Bell |title=The Foreign Protestants and the Settlement of Nova Scotia: The History of a Piece of Arrested British Colonial Policy in the Eighteenth Century |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=1961 |p=508 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3UzAAAAIAAJ |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the only contemporaneous image of the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]].]] The final colonial war was the [[French and Indian War]]. The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour.{{sfnp|Grenier|2008}}

During the French and Indian War, the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians and Mi'kmaq militias posed within Nova Scotia but particularly to the northern New England border in Maine. The British wanted to prevent future attacks from the Wabanaki Confederacy, French and Acadians on the northern New England border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/selectionsfrompu00nova#page/n211/mode/1up |first=Thomas |last=Akins |title=Papers on Forced Removal of the French Inhabitants |work=Selections from the Public Documents of the Province of Nova Scotia |date=1869 |p=382–385, 394}}&lt;/ref&gt; (There was a long history of these attacks from Acadia—see the Northeast Coast Campaigns [[King William's War#New England, Acadia and Newfoundland Theatre|1688]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1703)|1703]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1723)|1723]], [[Father Rale's War#Northeast Coast Campaign (1724)|1724]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1745)|1745]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1746)|1746]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1747)|1747]].&lt;ref name="Tod Scott 1781 pp. 1-18"/&gt;) The British saw the Acadians' allegiance to the French and the Wabanaki Confederacy as a military threat. Father Le Loutre's War had created the conditions for [[total war]]; British civilians had not been spared and, as Governor [[Charles Lawrence (British Army officer)|Charles Lawrence]] and the [[Nova Scotia Council]] saw it, Acadian civilians had provided intelligence, sanctuary, and logistical support while others had fought against the British.{{sfnp|Patterson|1994|p=146}}

Within Acadia, the British also wanted to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia.{{sfnp|Patterson|1998|pp=105–106}}{{sfnp|Patterson|1994|p=144}} Defeating Louisbourg, would also mean defeating the ally which provided the Mi'kmaq ammunition to fight.

The Acadians and Mi’kmaq fought in the Annapolis region. They were victorious in the [[Battle of Bloody Creek (1757)]].{{sfnp|Faragher|2005|p=110}} Acadians being deported from [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia]] on the ship ''Pembroke'' rebelled against the British crew. After fighting off an attack by another British vessel on February 9, 1756, the Acadians took 8 British prisoners to Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Pembroke Passenger List reconstructed |first=Paul |last=Delaney |translator-first=Karen Theriot |translator-last=Reader |work=Les Cahiers |publisher=La Société historique acadienne |volume=35 |issue=1 &amp; 2 |date=2004 |url=http://www.acadian-home.org/PD-Pembroke.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1757, while cutting firewood near Fort Anne, the Mi'kmaq warriors captured John Weatherspoon and carried him away to the mouth of the Miramichi River. From there he was eventually sold or traded to the French and taken to Quebec, where he was held until late in 1759 and the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, when General Wolfe's forces prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Journal of John Witherspoon |work=Collections of the Nova Scotia Historical Society |volume=Volume 2 |location=Halifax, Nova Scotia |publisher=The Morning Herald |p=31 |date=1881 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oVAzAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 50 or 60 Acadians who escaped the initial deportation are reported to have made their way to the [[Cape Sable Island|Cape Sable]] region (which included south western Nova Scotia). From there, they participated in numerous raids on [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]].{{sfnp|Bell|1961|p=503}}

Oral history indicates that a Samuel Rogers led a massacre against a Mi’kmaq village at Rogers Point (present-day Point Prim), Digby in the autumn of 1759.{{efn|Isaiah W. Wilson (1900) recorded this account in his book ''Geography and History of Digby County''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Isaiah W. |last=Wilson |title=Geography and History of Digby County |date=2013 |orig-year=1900 |location=London |publisher=Forgotten Books |pp=25–26 |url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/A_Geography_and_History_of_the_County_of_Digby_Nova_Scotia_1000564442/41}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Daniel Paul (2006) and Jon Tattrie (2013){{full citation needed|date=January 2016}} have repeated the account as historical fact. Paul has described it as the "Last overt act of genocide committed by the English against Nova Scotia's Mi’kmaq".

The story is said to have originated from someone who participated in the raid under the leadership of Samuel Rogers. The oral history indicates that Rogers was an active member of the famous [[Rogers' Rangers]] and of equal stature to [[George Scott (army officer)|George Scott]]. This Samuel Rogers is also said to be the same one who was later a member of the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia for Sackville (present-day Sackville, New Brunswick).

These descriptions of Samuel Rogers leave the credibility of the story in serious doubt. Samuel Rogers and this expedition could not have been related to Rogers' Rangers because there were no Rogers' Rangers in Nova Scotia in the autumn of 1759. There were only four companies of Rogers' Rangers to ever fight in the colony and they departed on June 6, 1759 and were never in the western region of the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Burt Garfield |last=Loescher |title=Genesis of Rogers Rangers: The First Green Berets |publisher= |location=San Mateo, California |date=1969 |p=26 |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofrogersr02loes#page/26 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, had there been a military officer of equal stature to George Scott in the colony, certainly there would be official records that support his existence, when there is not.

The Samuel Rogers of the oral tradition could not be the same Samuel Rogers who was later a member of the House of Assembly in 1775 (who was famous for becoming a leader in the [[Siege of Fort Cumberland]]). This Samuel Rogers was never connected to Rogers' Rangers and he died in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William Cochran |last=Milner |title=History of Sackville, New Brunswick |publisher=Tribune Press |location=Sackville, New Brunswick |date=1934 |url=http://www.canadagenweb.org/archives/nb/sackvill.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had he lived until he was age 90, he would have only been age 18 when he reached George Scott's stature and led the charge on the village.

==== Raids on Piziquid (Fort Edward) ====

In the April 1757, a band of Acadian and Mi'kmaq raided a warehouse near [[Fort Edward (Nova Scotia)|Fort Edward]], killing thirteen British soldiers.

By June 1757, the settlers had to be withdrawn completely from the settlement of [[Lawrencetown, Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]] (established 1754) because the number of Indian raids eventually prevented settlers from leaving their houses.{{sfnp|Bell|1961|p=508}}  On July 30, 1757, Mi'kmaw fighters killed three [[Roger's Rangers]] at Lawrencetown.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MIxGAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=surgeon+cutter's+journal+louisbourg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jbYX8_-aZC&amp;sig=vzGYRxr4Zn0DGh-lQbCVcUdrkkw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic1YDmvavNAhVKLlIKHUSYAlQQ6AEIKTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=surgeon%20cutter's%20journal%20louisbourg&amp;f=false A History of the Cutter Family of New England By Benjamin Cutter, p. 68]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historyofrogersr01loes#page/172/mode/2up The history of Rogers Rangers, vol. 1, p. 173]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Raids on Maine ====

In present-day [[Maine]], the Mi’kmaq and the Maliseet raided numerous New England villages. At the end of April 1755, they raided [[Gorham, Maine]], killing two men and a family. Next they appeared in New-Boston ([[Gray, Maine|Gray]]) and through the neighbouring towns destroying the plantations. On May 13, they raided Frankfort ([[Dresden, Maine|Dresden]]), where two men were killed and a house burned. The same day they raided Sheepscot (Newcastle), and took five prisoners. Two were killed in North Yarmouth on May 29 and one taken captive. They shot one person at Teconnet. They took prisoners at Fort Halifax; two prisoners taken at Fort Shirley (Dresden). They took two captive at New Gloucester as they worked on the local fort.{{sfnp|Williamson|1832|pp=111-112}}

On August 13, 1758, Boishebert left [[Miramichi, New Brunswick]] with 400 soldiers, including Acadians which he led from [[St. Peter's, Nova Scotia|Port Toulouse]]. They marched to Fort St George ([[Thomaston, Maine]]) and Munduncook ([[Friendship, Maine]]). While the former siege was unsuccessful, in the latter raid on Munduncook, they wounded eight British settlers and killed others. This was Boishébert’s last Acadian expedition.

{{efn|None of the oral accounts give the exact date of the battle. Awalt is left to speculate about the date of the battle, which he asserts might be in May 1758 just before [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|siege of Louisbourg]].

The two main players of the conflict - Paul Laurent and [[Jean-Baptiste Cope]] - both could not have been in Halifax in 1758 as indicated. Laurent was not seeking peace in 1758. Throughout the war Laurent fought the British and did not surrender until 29 February 1760 at Fort Cumberland.

==== Battle of Restigouche ====
An Acadian militia and Mi’kmaq militia, totalling 1500 militia, organized in the [[Battle of Restigouche]]. The Acadians arrived in about 20 schooners and small boats. Along with the French, they continued up river to draw the British fleet closer to the Acadian community of Pointe-à-la-Batterie, where they were ready to launch a surprise attack on the English. The Acadians sunk a number of their vessels to create a blockade, upon which the Acadian and Mi’kmaq fired at the ships. On 27 of June, the British succeeded in maneuvering just beyond the chain of sunken ships. Once the British were range of the battery, they fired on the battery. This skirmish lasted all night and was repeated with various breaks from June 28 to July 3, when the British overwhelmed Pointe à la Batterie, burning 150 to 200 buildings which made up the Acadian village community at Pointe à la Batterie.

The militias retreated and re-grouped with the French frigate Machault. They sunk more schooners to create another blockade. They created two new batteries, one on the South shore at Pointe de la Mission (today [[Listuguj]], Quebec), and one on the North shore at Pointe aux Sauvages (today [[Campbellton, New Brunswick]]). They created blockade with schooners at Pointe aux Sauvages. On July 7, British commander Byron spent the day getting rid of the battery at Pointe aux Sauvages and later returned to the task of destroying the Machault. By the morning of July 8, the Scarborough and the Repulse were in range of the blockade and face to face with the Machault. The British made two attempts to defeat the batteries and the militias held out.

[[File:Pierre Malliard Plaque.jpg|thumb| [[Pierre Maillard]], Negotiator for the Mi'kmaq, Plaque, [[St. Mary's Basilica (Halifax)]], Nova Scotia (He is reported to be buried on the grounds of [[St. Paul's Church (Halifax)]])]]
The Mí'kmaq signed a series of peace and friendship treaties with [[Great Britain]]. The first was after [[Father Rale's War]] (1725). The nation historically consisted of seven districts, which was later expanded to eight with the ceremonial addition of Great Britain at the time of the 1749 treaty.

Chief [[Jean-Baptiste Cope]] signed a [[Treaty of 1752]] on behalf of the [[Shubenacadie Valley|Shubenacadie]] Mi'kmaq.{{efn|Historian William Wicken notes that there is controversy about this assertion. While there are claims that Cope made the treaty on behalf of all the Mi'kmaq, there is no written documentation to support this assertion.{{sfnp|Wicken|2002|p=184}} }} After agreeing to several peace treaties, the seventy-five year period of war ended with the [[Halifax Treaties]] between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1760-1761). (In commemoration of these treaties, Nova Scotians annually celebrate [[Treaty Day (Nova Scotia)|Treaty Day]] on October 1.) Despite the treaties, the British continued to build fortifications in the province (see [[Fort Ellis (Nova Scotia)|Fort Ellis]] and Fort Belcher).

Historian's differ on the meaning of the Treaties. HIstorian Stephen Patterson indicates that the Halifax Treaties established a lasting peace on the basis that the MI'kmaq surrendered and chose to uphold the rule of law through the British courts rather than resorting to violence.  Patterson reports that the Mi'kmaq were not in a position of military strength after the defeat of the French.  He argues that without a supply of guns and ammunition, the Mi'kmaq lost their ability to fight and to hunt for food.  As a result, the British were able to define themselves the terms of the Treaties.  Patterson identifies the Halifax Treaties define the relationship between the Mi'kmaq and the British. While the Treaties do not stipulate the laws governing land and resources, the treaties ensured that both parties would follow the laws that would eventually be made to deal with these matters and any other matters. The British, accepted a continuing role for existing Mi'kmaw polities within the limits of British sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[John G. Reid]] dismisses the Treaties language about Mi'kmaw "submission" to the British crown, he believes that the Mi'kmaw intended a friendly and reciprocal relationship.  He asserts his interpretation is based on what is known of the surrounding discussions, combined with the strong evidence of later Mi'kmaw statements. The Mi'kmaw leaders who represented their people in the Halifax negotiations in 1760 had clear goals: to make peace, establish secure and well-regulated trade in commodities such as furs, and begin an ongoing friendship with the British crown. In return, they offered their own friendship and a tolerance of limited British settlement, although without any formal land surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John G. |last=Reid |title=Nova Scotia: A Pocket History |publisher=Fernwood |date=2009 |p=23 |isbn=978-1-5526-6325-7 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill the reciprocity intended by the Mi'kmaq, Ried argues that any additional British settlement of land would have to be negotiated, and accompanied by giving presents to the Mi'kmaq. (There was a long history of Europeans giving Mi'kmaq people presents to be accommodated on their land, starting with the first colonial contact.) The documents summarizing the peace agreements failed to establish specific territorial limits on the expansion of British settlements, but assured the Mi’kmaq of access to the natural resources that had long sustained them along the regions' coasts and in the woods. Their conceptions of land use were quite different. The Mi'kmaq believed they could share the land, with the British growing crops, and their people hunting as usual and getting to the coast for seafood.{{sfnp|Plank|2001|p=163}}

=== American Revolution ===

As the [[New England Planters]] and [[United Empire Loyalists]] began to arrive in Mi'kmaki (the Maritimes) in greater numbers, economic, environmental and cultural pressures were put on the Mi'kmaq with the erosion of the intent of the treaties. The Mi'kmaq tried to enforce the treaties through threat of force. At the beginning of the [[American Revolution]], many Mi’kmaq and Maliseet tribes were supportive of the Americans against the British. The [[Treaty of Watertown]], the first foreign [[treaty]] concluded by the [[United States of America]] after the adoption of the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]], was signed on July 19, 1776, in the [[Edmund Fowle House]] in the town of [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay]]. The treaty established a military alliance between the United States and the St. John's and [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] [[First Nations]] in [[Nova Scotia]]—two of the peoples of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]—against [[Great Britain]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. (These Mí'kmaq delegates did not officially represent the Mi'kmaq government, although many individual Mi'kmaq did privately join the Continental army as a result.)

Months after signing the treaty, they participated in the [[Maugerville, New Brunswick|Maugerville Rebellion]] and the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland]] in November 1776.

During the [[St. John River expedition]], Col. Allan's untiring effort to gain the friendship and support of the Maliseet and Mi'kmaq for the Revolution was somewhat successful. There was a significant exodus of Maliseet from the St John River to join the American forces at [[Machias, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannay, p. 119{{full citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Sunday, July 13, 1777, a party of between 400 and 500 men, women, and children, embarked in 128 canoes from the [[Meductic Indian Village / Fort Meductic|Old Fort Meduetic]] ({{convert|8|mi|km}} below Woodstock) for Machias. The party arrived at a very opportune moment for the Americans, and afforded material assistance in the defence of that post during [[Battle of Machias (1777)|the attack]] made by Sir [[George Collier]] on August 13–15. The British did only minimal damage to the place, and the services of the Indians on the occasion earned for them the thanks of the council of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=Raymond&gt;Rev. W. O. Raymond{{full citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1779, Mi’kmaq in the [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]] attacked and plundered some of the British in the area. The following month, British Captain Augustus Harvey, in command of {{HMS|Viper|1777|6}}, arrived in the area and battled with the Mi’kmaq. One Mi’kmaq was killed and 16 were taken prisoner to Quebec. The prisoners were eventually brought to Halifax, where they were later released upon signing the Oath of Allegiance to the British Crown on July 28, 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |first=L. F.

St. Aspinquid appeared in the Nova Scotia almanacs from 1774 to 1786. The festival was celebrated on or immediately after the last quarter of the moon in the month of May. The tide being low at that time, many of the principal inhabitants of the town, on these occasions, assembled on the shore of the North West Arm and partook of a dish of clam soup, the clams being collected on the spot at low water. There is a tradition that during the American troubles when agents of the revolted colonies were active to gain over the good people of Halifax, in the year 1786, were celebrating St. Aspinquid, the wine having been circulated freely, the Union Jack was suddenly hauled down and replaced by the Stars and Stripes. This was soon reversed, but all those persons who held public offices immediately left the grounds, and St. Aspinquid was never after celebrated at Halifax.{{sfnp|Akins|1895|p=218|loc=, Note 94}} }}

As their military power waned in the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Mi'kmaq people made explicit appeals to the British to honour the treaties and reminded them of their duty to give "presents" (i.e., rent) to the Mi'kmaq in order to occupy Mi'kma'ki. In response, the British offered charity or, the word most often used by government officials, "relief". The British said the Mi'kmaq must give up their way of life and begin to settle on farms. Also, they were told they had to send their children to British schools for education.{{sfnp|Reid|2009|p=26}}

==20th century==
[[File:Aboriginal War Veterans monument.JPG|thumb|[[National Aboriginal Veterans Monument]]]]
In 1914, over 150 Mi'kmaw men signed up during World War I. During the First World War, thirty-four out of sixty-four male Mi’kmaq from [[Lennox Island First Nation]], Prince Edward Island enlisted in the armed forces, distinguishing themselves particularly in the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John Joe |last=Sark |title=In our Words, Stories of Veterans |work=Mi'kmaq Maliseet Nations News |url=http://www.mmnn.ca/2013/12/in-our-words-stories-of-veterans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, World War II began and over 250 Mi'kmaq volunteer. In 1950, over 60 Mi'kmaq enlisted to serve in the Korean War.

The Treaties, which the Mi’kmaq militias fought for during the colonial period, did not gain legal status until they were enshrined into the [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|Canadian Constitution]] in 1982. Every October 1, "[[Treaty Day (Nova Scotia)|Treaty Day]]" is now celebrated by Nova Scotians.

{{Human history}}
'''Modernity''', a topic in the humanities and social sciences, is both a historical period (the [[modern era]]), as well as the ensemble of particular socio-cultural [[norm (social)|norms]], attitudes and practices that arose in the wake of the [[Renaissance]]{{mdash}}in the "[[Age of Reason]]" of 17th-century thought and the 18th-century "[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]". Some commentators consider the era of modernity to have ended by 1930, with [[World War II]] in 1945, or the 1980s or 1990s; the following era is called [[postmodernity]]. The term "[[contemporary history]]" is also used to refer to the post-1945 timeframe, without assigning it to either the modern or postmodern era.  (Thus "modern" may be used as a name of a particular era in the past, as opposed to meaning "the current era".)

Depending on the field, "modernity" may refer to different time periods or qualities.  In historiography, the 17th and 18th centuries are usually described as [[early modern]], while the [[long 19th century]] corresponds to "[[modern history]]" proper. While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from [[fashion]] to [[modern warfare]]), it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce, and their ongoing impact on human culture, institutions, and politics {{harv|Berman|2010|loc=15–36}}.

As an analytical concept and [[norm (philosophy)|normative]] ideal, modernity is closely linked to the [[ethos]] of philosophical and aesthetic [[modernism]]; political and intellectual currents that intersect with the Enlightenment; and subsequent developments such as [[existentialism]], [[modern art]], the formal establishment of [[social science]], and contemporaneous antithetical developments such as [[Marxism]].  It also encompasses the social relations associated with the rise of capitalism, and shifts in attitudes associated with secularisation and post-industrial [[Personal life|life]] {{harv|Berman|2010|loc=15–36}}.

In the view of [[Michel Foucault|Michel]] {{harvtxt|Foucault|1975}} (classified as a proponent of [[postmodernism]] though he himself rejected the "postmodernism" label, considering his work as a "a critical history of modernity"{{mdash}}see, e.g., {{harvnb|Call|2002|loc=65}}), "modernity" as a historical category is marked by developments such as a questioning or rejection of [[tradition]]; the prioritization of [[individualism]], [[political freedom|freedom]] and [[equality before the law|formal equality]]; faith in inevitable social, scientific and technological [[progress (history)|progress]], [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] and [[professionalization]], a movement from [[feudalism]] (or [[agrarianism]]) toward [[capitalism]] and the [[market economy]], [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]] and [[secularization]], the development of the [[nation-state]], [[representative democracy]], [[public education]] (etc.) {{harv|Foucault|1977|loc=170–77&lt;!--wrong for the Penguin edition, at any rate--&gt;}}.

In the context of [[art history]], "modernity" (''modernité'') has a more limited sense, "[[modern art]]" covering the period of c. 1860–1970. Use of the term in this sense is  attributed to [[Charles Baudelaire]], who in his 1864 essay "The Painter of Modern Life", designated the "fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis", and the responsibility art has to capture that experience. In this sense, the term refers to "a particular relationship to time, one characterized by intense historical discontinuity or rupture, openness to the novelty of the future, and a heightened sensitivity to what is unique about the present" {{harv|Kompridis|2006|loc=32–59}}.

==Etymology==
The [[Late Latin]] adjective ''[[:wikt:modernus#Latin|modernus]]'', a derivation from the adverb ''[[:wikt:modo#Latin|modo]]'' "presently, just now", is attested from the 5th century, at first in the context of distinguishing the [[Ancient Roman Christianity|Christian era]] from the [[Decline of Greco-Roman paganism|pagan era]]. 
In the 6th century, [[Cassiodorus]] appears to have been the first writer to use ''modernus'' "modern" regularly to refer to his own age {{harv|O'Donnell|1979|loc=235 n9}}. 
The terms ''antiquus'' and ''modernus'' were used in a chronological sense in the [[Carolingian era]]. For example, a ''magister modernus'' referred to a contemporary scholar, as opposed to old authorities such as [[Benedict of Nursia]]. In early medieval usage, ''modernus'' referred to authorities younger than pagan antiquity and the early church fathers, but not necessarily to the present day, and could include authors several centuries old, from about the time of [[Beda]], i.e. referring to the time after the foundation of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] and/or the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] {{harv|Hartmann|1974|loc=passim}}.

The Latin adjective was adopted in  [[Middle French]], as ''moderne'', by the 15th century, and hence, in the early [[Tudor period]], into [[Early Modern English]].
The early modern word meant "now existing", or "pertaining to the present times", not necessarily with a positive connotation.
[[Shakespeare]] uses ''modern'' in the sense of "every-day, ordinary, commonplace".

The word entered wide usage in the context of the  late 17th-century [[quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]] within the [[Académie française]], debating the question of "Is Modern culture superior to Classical (Græco–Roman) culture?"
In the context of this debate, the "ancients" (''anciens'') and "moderns" (''modernes'') were proponents of opposing views, the former believing that contemporary writers could do no better than imitate the genius of classical antiquity, while the latter, 
first with [[Charles Perrault]] (1687), proposed that more than a mere "[[Renaissance]]" of ancient achievements, the "[[17th-century philosophy|Age of Reason]]" had gone beyond what had been possible in the classical period. 
The term [[:wikt:modernity|modernity]], first coined in the 1620s, in this context assumed the implication of a historical epoch following the Renaissance, in which the achievements of antiquity were surpassed {{harv|Delanty| 2007}}.

==Phases&lt;!--'Phases of modernity' redirects here; section linked from 'Contemporary history'--&gt;==
Modernity has been associated with cultural and [[intellectual]] movements of 1436–1789 and extending to the 1970s or later {{harv|Toulmin|1992|loc=3–5}}.

According to [[Marshall Berman|Marshall]] {{harvtxt|Berman|1982|loc=16–17}}, modernity is periodized into three conventional phases (dubbed "Early," "Classical," and "Late," respectively, by Peter {{harvtxt|Osborne|1992|loc=25}}):

* [[Early modern period|Early modernity]]: 1500–1789 (or 1453–1789 in traditional historiography)
* Classical modernity: 1789–1900 (corresponding to the [[long 19th century]] (1789–1914) in [[Eric Hobsbawm|Hobsbawm]]'s scheme)
* Late modernity: 1900–1989

In the second phase Berman draws upon the growth of modern technologies such as the newspaper, telegraph and other forms of mass media. There was a great shift into modernization in the name of industrial capitalism. Finally in the third phase, modernist arts and individual creativity marked the beginning of a new modernist age  as it combats oppressive politics, economics as well as other social forces including mass media {{harv|Laughey|2007|loc=30}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Citations are needed to the relevant writings of Berman, not just to a tertiary source (namely Laughey 2007).--&gt;

Some authors, such as [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] and [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} believe that modernity ended in the mid- or late 20th century and thus have defined a period subsequent to modernity, namely [[Postmodernity]] (1930s/1950s/1990s–present). Other theorists, however, regard the period from the late 20th century to the present as merely another phase of modernity; [[Zygmunt Bauman|Zygmunt]] {{harvtxt|Bauman|1989}}{{Page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--Or is this in Bauman 2000, or both?--&gt; calls this phase [[Liquid modernity|"liquid" modernity]], {{harvtxt|Giddens|1998}}{{Page needed|date=September 2014}} labels it "high" modernity (see [[High modernism]]).

==Definition==

===Political===
Politically, modernity's earliest phase starts with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s works which openly rejected the medieval and Aristotelian style of analyzing politics by comparison with ideas about how things should be, in favour of realistic analysis of how things really are. He also proposed that an aim of politics is to control one's own chance or fortune, and that relying upon providence actually leads to evil. Machiavelli argued, for example, that violent divisions within political communities are unavoidable, but can also be a source of strength which lawmakers and leaders should account for and even encourage in some ways {{harv|Strauss|1987}}.

Machiavelli's recommendations were sometimes influential upon kings and princes, but eventually came to be seen as favoring free republics over monarchies {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=1}}. Machiavelli in turn influenced [[Francis Bacon]] {{harv|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[Marchamont Needham]] {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] ({{harvnb|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}), [[John Milton]] {{harv|Bock, Skinner, and Viroli|1990|loc=chapt. 11{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[David Hume]] {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, and many others {{harv|Strauss|1958}}.

Important modern political doctrines which stem from the new Machiavellian realism include [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville]]'s influential proposal that "''Private Vices by the dextrous Management of a skilful Politician may be turned into Publick Benefits''" (the last sentence of his ''[[Fable of the Bees]]''), and also the doctrine of a constitutional "[[separation of powers]]" in government, first clearly proposed by [[Montesquieu]]. Both these principles are enshrined within the [[constitution]]s of most [[modern democracy|modern democracies]]. It has been observed that while Machiavelli's realism saw a value to war and political violence, his lasting influence has been "tamed" so that useful conflict was deliberately converted as much as possible to formalized political struggles and the economic "conflict" encouraged between free, private enterprises ({{harvnb|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 5{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}; {{harvnb|Mansfield|1989}}).

Starting with [[Thomas Hobbes]], attempts were made to use the methods of the new modern physical sciences, as proposed by [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] and [[Descartes]], applied to humanity and politics {{harv|Berns|1987}}. Notable attempts to improve upon the methodological approach of Hobbes include those of [[John Locke]] {{harv|Goldwin|1987}}, [[Spinoza]] {{harv|Rosen|1987}}, [[Giambattista Vico|Giambattista]] {{harvtxt|Vico|1984|loc=xli}}, and {{harvtxt|Rousseau|1997|loc=part 1}}. [[David Hume]] made what he considered to be the first proper attempt at trying to apply Bacon's scientific method to political subjects {{harv|Hume|1896 [1739]|loc=''intro.''}}, rejecting some aspects of the approach of Hobbes.

Modernist republicanism openly influenced the foundation of republics during the [[Dutch Revolt]] (1568–1609) {{harv|Bock, Skinner, and Viroli|1990|loc=chapt. 10,12{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive pages.--&gt;}}, [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}, [[American Revolution]] (1775–1783) {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 6–11{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}, the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799), and the Haitian revolution (1791–1804). {{harv|Orwin and Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 8{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}.

A second phase of modernist political thinking begins with Rousseau, who questioned the natural rationality and sociality of humanity and proposed that [[human nature]] was much more malleable than had been previously thought. By this logic, what makes a good political system or a good man is completely dependent upon the chance path a whole people has taken over history. This thought influenced the political (and aesthetic) thinking of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Edmund Burke]] and others and led to a critical review of modernist politics. On the conservative side, Burke argued that this understanding encouraged caution and avoidance of radical change. However more ambitious movements also developed from this insight into human [[culture]], initially [[Romanticism]] and [[Historicism]], and eventually both the [[Communism]] of [[Karl Marx]], and the modern forms of [[nationalism]] inspired by the [[French Revolution]], including, in one extreme, the German [[Nazi]] movement {{harv|Orwin and Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}.

On the other hand, the notion of modernity has been contested also due to its Euro-centric underpinnings. This is further aggravated by the re-emergence of non-Western powers. Yet, the contestations about modernity are also linked with Western notions of democracy, social discipline, and development {{harv|Regilme|2012|loc=96}}.

===Sociological===
[[File:Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of the original German edition of [[Max Weber]]'s ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'']]
In [[sociology]], a discipline that arose in direct response to the social problems of "modernity" {{harv|Harriss|2000|loc=325}}, the term most generally refers to the social conditions, processes, and discourses consequent to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In the most basic terms, [[Anthony Giddens]] describes modernity as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...a shorthand term for modern society, or industrial civilization. Portrayed in more detail, it is associated with (1) a certain set of attitudes towards the world, the idea of the world as open to transformation, by human intervention; (2) a complex of economic institutions, especially industrial production and a market economy; (3) a certain range of political institutions, including the nation-state and mass democracy. Largely as a result of these characteristics, modernity is vastly more dynamic than any previous type of social order. It is a society—more technically, a complex of [[institution]]s—which, unlike any preceding culture, lives in the future, rather than the past {{harv|Giddens|1998|loc=94}}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other writers have criticized such definitions as just being a listing of factors. They argue that modernity, contingently understood as marked by an ontological formation in dominance, needs to be defined much more fundamentally in terms of different ways of being. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The modern is thus defined by the way in which prior valences of social life ... are reconstituted through a constructivist reframing of social practices in relation to basic categories of existence common to all humans: time, space, embodiment, performance and knowledge. The word 'reconstituted' here explicitly does not mean replaced. {{harv|James|2015|loc= 51–52}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This means that modernity overlays earlier formations of traditional and customary life without necessarily replacing them.

===Cultural and philosophical===
The era of modernity is characterised socially by industrialisation and the division of labour and philosophically by "the loss of certainty, and the realization that certainty can never be established, once and for all" {{harv|Delanty|2007}}. With new social and philosophical conditions arose fundamental new challenges. Various 19th-century intellectuals, from [[Auguste Comte]] to [[Karl Marx]] to [[Sigmund Freud]], attempted to offer scientific and/or political ideologies in the wake of secularisation. Modernity may be described as the "age of ideology." {{harv|Calinescu|1987|loc=2006}}.

{{Quote|For Marx, what was the basis of modernity was the emergence of capitalism and the revolutionary bourgeoisie, which led to an unprecedented expansion of productive forces and to the creation of the world market. [[Durkheim]] tackled modernity from a different angle by following the ideas of Saint-Simon about the industrial system. Although the starting point is the same as Marx, feudal society, Durkheim emphasizes far less the rising of the bourgeoisie as a new revolutionary class and very seldom refers to capitalism as the new mode of production implemented by it. The fundamental impulse to modernity is rather industrialism accompanied by the new scientific forces. In the work of [[Max Weber]], modernity is closely associated with the processes of rationalization and disenchantment of the world. {{harv|Larraín|2000|loc=13}}}}

[[Critical theory|Critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Zygmunt Bauman]] propose that modernity or industrialization represents a departure from the central tenets of the Enlightenment and towards nefarious processes of [[social alienation|alienation]], such as [[commodity fetishism]] and the [[Holocaust]] ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}; {{harvnb|Bauman|1989}}). Contemporary sociological [[critical theory]] presents the concept of "[[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]" in even more negative terms than those Weber originally defined. Processes of rationalization—as progress for the sake of progress—may in many cases have what critical theory says is a negative and dehumanising effect on modern society. ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}; {{harvnb|Bauman|2000}})

{{Quote|Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth radiates under the sign of disaster triumphant. ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973|loc=210}})}}

{{Quote|What prompts so many commentators to speak of the 'end of history', of post-modernity, 'second modernity' and 'surmodernity', or otherwise to articulate the intuition of a radical change in the arrangement of human cohabitation and in social conditions under which life-politics is nowadays conducted, is the fact that the long effort to accelerate the speed of movement has presently reached its 'natural limit'. Power can move with the speed of the electronic signal – and so the time required for the movement of its essential ingredients has been reduced to instantaneity. For all practical purposes, power has become truly exterritorial, no longer bound, or even slowed down, by the resistance of space (the advent of cellular telephones may well serve as a symbolic 'last blow' delivered to the dependency on space: even the access to a telephone market is unnecessary for a command to be given and seen through to its effect. {{harv|Bauman|2000|loc=10}}}}

Consequent to debate about [[economic globalization]], the comparative analysis of civilizations, and the post-colonial perspective of "alternative modernities," [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] introduced the concept of "multiple modernities" ({{harvnb|Eisenstadt|2003}}; see also {{harvnb|Delanty|2007}}). Modernity as a "plural condition" is the central concept of this sociologic approach and perspective, which broadens the definition of "modernity" from exclusively denoting Western European culture to a [[cultural relativism|culturally relativistic]] definition, thereby: "Modernity is not Westernization, and its key processes and dynamics can be found in all societies" {{harv|Delanty|2007}}.

===Secularization===
Modernity, or the Modern Age, is typically defined as a post-[[traditional]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} and post-[[medieval]] historical period ({{harvnb|Heidegger|1938|loc=66–67}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QImd2ARqQPMC&amp;pg=PA66 66–67]). Central to modernity is emancipation from [[religion]], specifically the hegemony of [[Christianity]], and the consequent secularization. Modern thought repudiates the [[Judeo-Christian]] belief in the Biblical God as a mere relic of superstitious ages ({{harvnb|Fackenheim|1957|loc=272-73}}; {{harvnb|Husserl|1931}}, {{Page needed|date=February 2012}}).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from {{harvnb|Fackenheim|1967|loc=272–73}}: {{quotation|But there does seem to be a necessary conflict between modern thought and the Biblical belief in revelation. All claims of revelation, modern science and philosophy seem agreed, must be repudiated, as mere relics of superstitious ages. ... [to a modern phylosopher] The Biblical God...was a mere myth of bygone ages.}} Quotation from {{harvnb|Husserl|1931}},{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}: {{quotation|When, with the beginning of modern times, religious belief was becoming more and more externalized as a lifeless convention, men of intellect were lifted by a new belief, their great belief in an autonomous philosophy and science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It all started with Descartes' revolutionary [[methodic doubt]], which transformed the concept of truth in the concept of certainty, whose only guarantor is no longer God or the Church, but Man's subjective judgement ({{harvnb|Alexander|1931|loc=484-85}}; {{harvnb|Heidegger|1938}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from Heidegger 1938{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;!--If this English version is taken from one of the two mentioned published translations, then that edition should be cited instead of the German one; otherwise the grammatical and spelling mistakes cannot be verified.--&gt;: {{quotation|The essence of modernity can be seen in humanity's freeing itself from the bonds of Middle Ages... Certainly the modern age has, as a consequence of the liberation of humanity, introduced subjectivism and indivisualism. ... For up to Descartes... The claim [of a self-supported, unshakable foundation of truth, in the sense of certainty] originates in that emancipation of man in which he frees himself from obligation to Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine to a legislating for himself that takes its stand upon itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologians have tried to cope with their worry that Western modernism has brought the world to no longer being well-disposed towards Christianity ({{harvnb|Kilby|2004|loc=262}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G26xfiuhCmIC&amp;pg=PA262 262]; {{harvnb|Davies|2004|loc=133}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G26xfiuhCmIC&amp;pg=PA133 133]; {{harvnb|Cassirer|1944|loc=13–14}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=x46qiaccZLYC&amp;pg=PA14 13–14]).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from {{harvnb|Kilby|2004|loc=262}}: {{quotation|... a cluster of issues surrounding the assessment of modernity and of the apologetic task of theology in modernity. Both men [Rahner and Balthasar] were deeply concerned with apologetics, with the question of how to present Christianity in a world which is no longer well-disposed towards it. ... both thought that modernity raised particular problems for being a believing Christian, and therefore for apologetics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernity aimed towards "a progressive force promising to liberate humankind from ignorance and irrationality" {{harv|Rosenau|1992|loc=5}}.

===Scientific===
{{Main|Modern science}}
In the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]], [[Galileo]] and others developed a new approach to physics and astronomy which changed the way people came to think about many things. Copernicus presented new models of the [[solar system]] which no longer placed humanity's home, on [[Earth]], in the centre. Kepler used mathematics to discuss physics and described regularities of nature this way. Galileo actually made his famous proof of uniform acceleration in [[freefall]] using mathematics ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 1,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

[[Francis Bacon]], especially in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', argued for a new experimental based approach to science, which sought no knowledge of [[four causes|formal or final causes]], and was therefore [[materialism|materialist]], like the ancient philosophy of [[Democritus]] and [[Epicurus]]. But he also added a theme that science should seek to control nature for the sake of humanity, and not seek to understand it just for the sake of understanding. In both these things he was influenced by Machiavelli's earlier criticism of medieval [[Scholasticism]], and his proposal that leaders should aim to control their own fortune ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 1,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

Influenced both by Galileo's new physics and Bacon, [[René Descartes]] argued soon afterward that [[mathematics]] and [[geometry]] provided a model of how scientific knowledge could be built up in small steps. He also argued openly that human beings themselves could be understood as complex machines ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 6{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

[[Isaac Newton]], influenced by Descartes, but also, like Bacon, a proponent of experimentation, provided the archetypal example of how both [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[mathematics]], [[geometry]] and [[theory|theoretical]] [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] on the one hand, and [[Baconian method|Baconian]] [[scientific method|experimental observation]] and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] on the other hand, together could lead to great advances in the practical understanding of regularities in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] ({{harvnb|d'Alembert|2009 [1751]}}; {{harvnb|Henry|2004}}).

===Artistic===
{{Main|Modern art}}

After modernist political thinking had already become widely known in France, [[Rousseau]]'s re-examination of human nature led to a new criticism of the value of [[reason]]ing itself which in turn led to a new understanding of less rationalistic human activities, especially the arts. The initial influence was upon the movements known as [[German Idealism]] and [[Romanticism]] in the 18th and 19th century. Modern art therefore belongs only to the later phases of modernity {{harv|Orwinand Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 2,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}.

For this reason [[art history]] keeps the term "modernity" distinct from the terms [[Modern History|Modern Age]] and [[Modernism]] – as a discrete "term applied to the cultural condition in which the seemingly absolute necessity of [[innovation]] becomes a primary fact of life, work, and thought". And modernity in art "is more than merely the state of being modern, or the opposition between old and new" {{harv|Smith|2009}}.

In the [[essay]] "The Painter of Modern Life" (1864)&lt;!--NB: Baudelaire died in 1867, do not confuse this date of original composition with the year of publication of the English edition of Baudelaire's writings.--&gt;, Charles Baudelaire gives a literary definition: "By modernity I mean the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent" {{harv|Baudelaire|1964|loc=13}}.

Advancing technological innovation, affecting artistic technique and the means of manufacture, changed rapidly the possibilities of art and its status in a rapidly changing society.  Photography challenged the place of the painter and painting.  Architecture was transformed by the availability of steel for structures.

===Theological===
From theologian [[Thomas C. Oden]]'s perspective, "modernity" is marked by "four fundamental values" {{harv|Hall|1990}}: 
* "Moral relativism (which says that what is right is dictated by culture, social location, and situation)"
* "Autonomous individualism (which assumes that moral authority comes essentially from within)"
* "Narcissistic hedonism (which focuses on egocentric personal pleasure)"
* "Reductive naturalism (which reduces what is reliably known to what one can see, hear, and empirically investigate)"
Modernity rejects anything "old" and makes "novelty ... a criterion for truth." This results in a great "phobic response to anything antiquarian." In contrast, "classical Christian consciousness" resisted "novelty" {{harv|Hall|1990}}.

Pope Pius IX and Pope Pius X of the Roman Catholic Church claim that [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|Modernism]] (in a particular definition of the Catholic Church) is a danger to the Christian faith. Pope Pius IX compiled a [[Syllabus of Errors]] published on December 8, 1864 to describe his objections to Modernism {{harv|Pius IX|1864}}. Pope Pius X further elaborated on the characteristics and consequences of Modernism, from his perspective, in an encyclical entitled "[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]" (Feeding the Lord's Flock) on September 8, 1907 {{harv|Pius X|1907}}. Pascendi Dominici Gregis states that the principles of Modernism, taken to a logical conclusion, lead to atheism. The Roman Catholic Church was serious enough about the threat of Modernism that it required all Roman Catholic clergy, pastors, confessors, preachers, religious superiors and seminary professors to swear an [[Oath against modernism|Oath Against Modernism]]  {{harv|Pius X|1910}} from 1910 until this directive was rescinded in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;!--The 1910 source does not (and cannot) confirm the directive was rescinded in 1967.--&gt;

==Defined==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Don Quixote]] --&gt;
Of the available conceptual definitions in [[sociology]], modernity is "marked and defined by an obsession with '[[evidence]]'," [[visual culture]], and personal visibility {{harv|Leppert|2004|loc=19}}. Generally, the large-scale social integration constituting modernity, involves{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} the:
* increased movement of goods, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], people, and information among formerly discrete populations, and consequent influence beyond the local area
* increased formal social organization of mobile populaces, development of "circuits" on which they and their influence travel, and societal standardization conducive to socio-economic mobility
* increased specialization of the segments of society, i.e., [[division of labor]], and area inter-dependency
* increased level of excessive stratification in terms of social life of a modern man 
* Increased state of dehumanisation, dehumanity, unionisation, as man became embittered about the negative turn of events which sprouted a growing fear. 
* man became a victim of the underlying circumstances presented by the modern world 
* Increased competitiveness amongst people in the society (survival of the fittest) as the jungle rule sets in.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5136">'''Navasard''', the [[Armenian calendar|Armenian calendar's]] first month. The Navasard month has had 30 days which started on 11 August and ended on 9 September. For ancient Armenians, the first day of Navasard (11 August) has been a social gatherings, festivals and celebrations day throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Հայոց Հնօրյա Զվարճախոսները|last=Խաչատրյան|first=Հայկ|publisher=«Ամարաս»|location=Երևան|year=2003|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navasardian god in Armenian mythology was considered the protector of the crops and the feeder of the hungry. His statue is currently standing in [[Bagavan]], which is today considered a sanctuary to [[Paganism|Pagans]].

== History ==

=== General history of the first month ===
The first month of the year was considered the modern August and was called Navasard by Armenians. Likewise start-of-year positions affected economic and cultural capitals adding difficulties to certain trading deals, especially ones done in wintertime. Therefore, after the end of the century XVI (approximately around 1582), it was internationally decided to consider January as the first month of a year, considered as the [[Gregorian calendar]].

The Gregorian calendar was introduced to the people by the [[pope]] of the time [[Pope Gregory XIII|Gregory XIII]].

Even though this decision was made internationally, traditional and old calendars are still being used in countries in the [[Middle East|Middle]] and [[Near East]]s (Iran, Afghanistan, other Arab countries).

=== Navasard history ===

The word Navasard is composed of "nav" meaning new and "sard" meaning year in Armenian, directly translating it to "New Year". It was later adopted to [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]-[[Persian language|Persian]] known as “Nawruz”.

Navasard month was also considered the last month of summer and was referred to as the "introduction of the golden autumn". Throughout the Navasardian days; the Armenian lands would reach to a prosperity peak, especially the [[grapefruit]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es and [[watermelon]]s.

==== Celebrations ====
The Navasardian festivals were considered the biggest celebrations of the year. The celebrations used to start from the start of the Navasard month and lasted a week.

Armenian families used to serve their best feasts during lunch and suppertime, having very big numbers of dining guests ranging from family to friends. They also hung stockings on their doors and impatiently expected drops of gifts put in them, as a tradition nowadays done too.

The representative Armenian Gods of the Navasardian celebrations are the [[Astghik]], [[Vahagn]] and [[Anahit]] gods.

==== Celebration locations ====
In Ancient Armenia, the Navasardian celebrations carried a cultural significance and to which participated all the representatives of the nation. The celebrations were initially done at [[Bagavan]], but then they were relocated to the Ashtishat region. The celebrations also included the worship of water and rivers, therefore they chose these two regions to be also located at the shores of the Aradzani (now known as the [[Murat River]]).

=== Ceremony ===
On the day of the ceremonies, the region of Bagavan would be decorated in many colorful decorations, the king would be present as well as a big part of the army, up to 120,000 in number.

According to ancient book descriptions, colorful tents set up on the shore of Murat are seen, the golden tent would always be the king's, the most beautiful of the tents usually belonged to the elite of the nation. Most of the people spent their times under big trees' shadows to hide away from the sun while they watched the celebrations and performances.

Throughout the day, doves and deer would be sacrificed in the name of the gods. Usually the horns of the deer were painted colorfully. There also was set up a big bonfire at nighttime where kids and young adults would try to jump over and around it to scare and drive away bad spirits. The celebrating people would bring their first set of harvest of the year to share with others.

Horseback riding races were done, as well as deer racing. The let go hundreds of doves into the air for good luck. Dancing, singing, intellectual and athletic competitive games were a big part of the celebrations, where competitors would try to impress the ones they admire in the audience.

=== Organized games ===
In Ashtishat, games similar to the current well-known [[Olympic games]] were organized to choose the best athlete in a bundle of performed games.

While the athletes competed, poets and instrumentalists merged and performed their own music and lyrics, as well as painters drew the event in various methods, accordingly to their point of view. A water festival, referred to as [[Vardavar]], also takes place, where everyone drenched each other with water using different types of containers a bucket. The Vardavar festival is still done every year all over Armenia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2085">'''Peter Fisher''' (9 June 1782 – 15 August 1848) was a [[historian]] and [[merchant]] in the British colony of [[New Brunswick]].

Fisher emigrated to [[New Brunswick]] from [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] at 15 months of age.  He was the son of [[United Empire Loyalist]] refugees of the [[American Revolutionary War]] who fled north in 1783.  Fisher's family settled at St. Anne’s Point on the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]], which was an area set aside for the Loyalist military regiments.  St. Anne's Point was later renamed [[Fredericton, New Brunswick|Fredericton]] and designated the capital of the newly established colony.

Fisher received a good education for the time and was married in 1807 and had eleven children, some of whom were noteworthy in [[New Brunswick]] history. Little is known of his personal life other than he was a merchant and also probably farmed as would have been customary of the era. Fisher was a writer and is often referred to as "the first historian of New Brunswick." The two histories, ''Sketches'' and ''Notitia,'' can definitely be attributed to him. Other works may be his, however, an apparent unwillingness to claim authorship on his part has made authentication difficult.

Fisher's writings have illustrated a man of only moderate literary skills, however, he possessed sharp observation skills and maintained a keen interest in the developmental steps being taken by the colony during his lifetime.

'''Plica''' (from [[Latin]] ''plica'' - fold) is a term from [[sigillography]] for the reinforcement of the lower edge of a [[charter]] or [[deed]], produced by folding up the bottom of the sheet of [[parchment]] to achieve a double thickness. 

The purpose of the fold is to provide a more secure anchorage for the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], and to guard against the parchment being torn. Slots were normally cut in the double thickness of parchment, a cord or tag of parchment threaded through them, and the seal attached to that.

==Opening of the Vatican archives==
In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the awakening critical investigation of the past led some scholars to resort to the treasures of the papal archives. The most far-reaching and efficient use of the archives for historical purposes began with [[Cæsar Baronius]]. Through his work, and in the several continuations of it by others, the world first learned of the wealth of historical documents contained in the Roman archives, and especially in the archives of the Vatican. The extensive ''[[Bullaria]]'', or compilations of papal decrees, general and particular (see [[Bulls and Briefs]]), are drawn in part from the archives of the recipients, have only reached their imposing array of volumes because the Vatican furnished abundant material.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, ecclesiastical historians and the writers of the numerous monographs concerning local churches, monasteries, ecclesiastical institutions, etc. were aided by the officials of the archives, themselves often scholarly investigators. In this respect the papal archivist [[Augustin Theiner]] (1804–74) accomplished far-reaching work when he published, in many folio volumes, a multitude of documents relative to the ecclesiastical and civil history of Northern, Eastern, and Southern Europe, also a documentary treatise in three folio volumes on the temporal dominion of the pope and its administration. In the same period, i.e. from about 1850 to 1875, several other investigators, chiefly German and Austrian, in one way or another secured admittance to the papal archives. These events and other influences increased the desire of all scholars for the opening of this valuable repository of important historical documents. Although under [[Pope Pius IX]] it became somewhat easier to obtain a permit for private research, the political conditions of his reign worked against a general opening of the Vatican Archives.

"We have nothing to fear from the publication of documents", exclaimed [[Pope Leo XIII]], when on 20 June 1879, he appointed the ecclesiastical historian, [[Joseph Hergenröther]], "Cardinal Archivist of the Holy Roman Church" (Palmieri, "Introite ed Esiti di Papa Niccolò III", Rome, pp. xiv, xv; Friedensburg, "Das kgl. Preussische Historische Institut in Rom", Berlin, 1903, passim). He opened to students the archives of the Vatican, more especially what are known as the [[Vatican secret archives|secret archives]], despite strong opposition from several quarters.

It took until the beginning of 1881 to arrange all preliminaries, including the preparation of suitable quarters for the work, after which date the barriers were removed which, until then, with a few exceptions, had shut out investigators. The use of these treasures was at length regularized by a papal Decree (regolamento) of 1 May 1884. In the meantime the pope had addressed to the three cardinals, [[Pitra]], [[De Luca]], and Hergenröther, his letter on historical studies (18 August 1883).

==Research in the Secret Archives==
Hitherto very little was known of the contents of this vast treasury; now its great wealth came to be widely appreciated - Briefs, Bulls, petitions, department records, reports of nuncios and other reports, diaries, documentary collections, privileges, legal titles of the most miscellaneous kind, etc. Progress was at first rather slow, for no systematic use of the archives could be planned until the workers had familiarized themselves with the material at hand. The hasty treatment that, in the beginning, the thirteenth century material received, revealed how much there was to learn before the archives could be used to the best advantage.

Gradually, order was introduced in all kinds of research work, in which task notable services were rendered by the historical institutes which were established in close relation to the Vatican Archives. Research work in these archives may be divided into individual and collective, or general and special. Individual researches are made by individual scholars, while collective work is conducted by several who have either united for that purpose, or belong permanently to some association. General research devotes itself to the larger outlines of ecclesiastical history, while special research seeks the solution of particular problems, more or less far-reaching in importance. Both methods may be combined, objectively and subjectively; an individual investigator may work at a general theme, while an association may take up the study of a restricted or specific problem, and vice versa. The results of Vatican historical study are to be found in periodicals, essays, and books, also disseminated in large historical collections devoted to other classes of historical material, and containing the results of other investigations, e.g. the "Monumenta Germaniæ Historica". A study of the published material exhibits long series of original documents, narratives based on copious documentary material, and occasionally narratives based on information obtained in the archives, but unaccompanied by the documents or by reference to them.

==Fields of investigation==
While it is but natural that the study of documents should be chiefly done in the Vatican archives, most investigators also carry on work in the important collection of printed books known as the Vatican Library. In October, 1892, there was opened in connexion with the archives and the Library a consultation library, the "Bibliotheca Leoniana", in order to facilitate research, historical and Biblical. Governments, academies, libraries, archives, and corporations contributed to it, and it has already reached very large proportions. The archives themselves are so organized that nearly every student of history may discover there something of special importance in his own province. The numerous other archives and manuscript-collections of Rome are also open, as a rule, to the student; indeed, few workers limit themselves exclusively to Vatican materials. Moreover, studies begun in the Vatican are often supplemented by scientific excursions to other Italian cities, either on the student's homeward journey or during some vacation period; such excursions have at times resulted in surprising discoveries. An exhaustive examination of Italian archives and libraries leads occasionally to a larger view of the subject than was originally intended by the investigator, for whom in this way new questions of importance spring up, the definite solution of which becomes highly desirable. Experience, therefore, and the detailed study of the numerous repertories, indexes, and inventories of manuscripts, have made it necessary to organize permanently the scientific historical researches carried on in the interest of any given country. This means a saving of money and of labour; in this way also more substantial achievements can be hoped for than from purely individual research. Consequently, institutes for historical research were soon founded in Rome, somewhat on the plan of the earlier archæological societies. While the opening of such institutes is a nobile offlcium of any government, private associations have made serious sacrifices in the same direction and sustained with success the institutes they have called into life. The state institutes investigate all that pertains to national relations or intercourse (religion, politics, economics, science, or art) with the Curia, with Rome, or, for that matter, with Italy. Many of these institutes do not attempt to go further, and their field is certainly comprehensive and in itself admirable. Others devote themselves to similar researches, but do not neglect general questions of interest to universal history, profane or ecclesiastical, or to the history of medieval culture. Of course, only the larger institutes, with many workers at their disposal, can satisfactorily undertake problems of this nature.

==Historical Institutes==
===England===
At the end of 1876 the Rev. [[Joseph Stevenson]], who was employed by the English [[Public Record Office]] to obtain transcripts of documents of historical importance in the Vatican archives, resigned his appointment, and [[Sir Thomas Hardy]], on [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]]'s recommendation, appointed [[William Henry Bliss]] as his successor. For years Stevenson and Bliss conducted their researches alone.

Later other English investigators were detailed to Rome to co-operate with Bliss and hasten the progress of his work. Bliss died very suddenly of pneumonia; English investigators continued the work, under direction of the Record Office. Five volumes of ''Calendars of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland'', by Bliss and collaborators, were published.

In addition to the medieval material, numerous extracts and transcripts of a political nature were made from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century documents, transmitted to the Record Office and partly used in the ''Calendars of State Papers''.

===France===
The Ecole Française de Rome, originally one with that of Athens, employs almost constantly historical investigators at the Grande Archivio of Naples; they devote themselves to the documents of the Angevin dynasty. This institute has an organ of its own, the "Mélanges d'archéologie et d'histoire", in whose pages are found not only historical studies properly so called, but also papers on the history of archæology and of art. The institute has s home in the Palazzo Farnese, where its director lives, and where a rich library is housed. It was founded in 1873, and during the reign of Pius IX, long before the opening of the secret archives, inaugurated its great achievement, the editing of the papal ''[[Regesta]]'' of the thirteenth century. Scholars of international reputation have figured among its directors, including [[Louis Duchesne]].

The "Bibliothèque des Ecoles Françaises d'Athènes et de Rome", is made up of lengthy monographs by pupils of the Ecole, treating of divers subjects connected with their studies in the Vatican archives and library. The papal "Regesta" of the thirteenth century, the "Liber Pontificalis", and the "Liber Censuum" (Fabre-Duchesne) form a second series of historical publications to the credit of the French school. A third series is made up of documents selected from the fourteenth-century papal "Regesta", and is entitled "Lettres des papes d'Avignon se rapportant à la France". The slow progress of so many learned enterprises is a matter of general regret, nor can one always approve the methods employed, though no one can deny the very great utility of these scholarly studies and researches for the history of the papacy and its international relations. The chaplains of the French National Institute of St-Louis des Français have recently undertaken a work closely related to that of the Ecole Française, the publication in concise regesta-like form of all letters of the Avignon popes. Gratifying progress is being made with the "Regesta" of John XXII. The review known as the "Annales de St-Louis des Français", whose contributions to ecclesiastical history were noteworthy, has been discontinued. Other works of a learned historical nature have been published by the chaplains of this institute, the results of their diligent researches in the Vatican archives.

===German Catholic Institutes===
The chaplains of the German national institute of Santa Maria di Campo Santo Teutonico were among the first to profit by the opening of the secret archives for the conduct of scientific research in the field of German ecclesiastical history. Monsignor de Waal, director of the institute, founded the "Römische Quartalschrift für Archäologie und Kirchengeschichte" as a centre for historical research more modest and limited in scope, and it fulfils this purpose in a creditable manner. To the students of history at the Campo Santo is owing the founding, at Rome, of the Görres Society Historical Institute. This institute, established after long hesitation, sufficiently explained by the slender resources of the society, is now a credit to its founders (besides regular reports, begun in 1890, on the work of this institute, and filed in the records of the society, see Cardauns, "Die Görres Gesellschaft, 1876-1901", Cologne, 1901, pp.&amp;nbsp;65–73). In 1900 a new department was added and placed under the guidance of Monsignor Wilpert, for the study of Christian archæology and the history of Christian art. The Roman labours of the Görres Society Institute deal chiefly with nunciature reports,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Nuntiaturberichte aus Deutschland, nebst ergänzenden Aktenstücken: Die [[Apostolic Nuncio to Cologne|Kölner Nuntiatur]]'': so far 20 vols., edited on behalf of the Preussisches Historisches Institut (Roma; now Deutsches Historisches Institut), Görres-Gesellschaft zur Pflege der Wissenschaft, and Akademie der Wissenschaften (Vienna), Paderborn et al.: Schöningh, 1895 to present.&lt;/ref&gt; the administration records of the Curia since 1300, and the Acts of the Council of Trent. Other publications, more or less broad in scope, are published regularly in the "Historisches Jahrbuch", among its "Quellen und Forschungen", or in other organs of the Görres Society. The twelve volumes in which this institute proposes to edit exhaustively the Acts and records of the [[Council of Trent]], represented one of the most difficult tasks which could be set before a body of workers in the Vatican archives. The aforesaid investigation of medieval papal administration and financial records, which the institute investigates in cooperation with the Austrian Leo Society, open up a chief source of information for the history of the Curia in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.

The results accomplished by this purely private association surpass greatly those of many governmental institutes. The Görres Society Institute maintains at Rome no library of its own, but aids efficiently in the growth of the fine library at the Campo Santo Teutonico, near the Vatican. The Leo Society supports at Rome a trained investigator, who devotes his time to publications from the papal treasury (Camera), records of the later Middle Ages. The present director of the Görres Society Institute is Prof. Dr. Stefan Heid.

===Austria===
The Austrian institute (Instituto Austriaco di studi storici), established by [[Theodor von Sickel]], and then directed by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], was set up in 1883. It cooperated in the publication of the [[nunciature]] reports, and contemplates the publication of the correspondence of the legates and the ambassadors at the Council of Trent.

Among the publications of this institute are Sickel's study on the "Privilegium Ottonianum"; his edition of the "Liber Diurnus"; and his "Römische Berichte" (Roman reports). Studies by this institute appeared in the "Mittheilungen des österreichischen Institutes für Geschichtsforschung,", dealing with the work of the medieval papal chancery, while [[Ottenthal]]'s "Chancery Rules" and [[Tangl]]'s "Chancery Regulations" are standard works on the Middle Ages. Numerous historical commissions were sent from [[Bohemia]] to Rome (concerning which, see below).

===Prussia===
A short history of the founding of the Prussian historical institute was published by Friedensburg (Berlin, Academy of Sciences). The project dated back to 1883, but it was not until May 1888 that [[Konrad Schottmüller]] succeeded in opening a Prussian Historical Bureau that began modestly enough, but soon developed into the actual Prussian Institute, reorganized (12 November 1902) on a materially enlarged scale, and now the most important of all historical institutes at Rome, owing largely to the efforts of its present director, Professor Kehr. In addition to the general work of historical investigations, special departments are conducted for the history of art and for patristic and Biblical research. Besides its own publication, "Quellen und Forschungen aus italienischen Archiven" the [[German Historical Institute in Rome]] (DHI Rome) today issues a series of German nunciature reports (eleven volumes since 1897). The Library of the Institute, besides extensive monographs on various subjects, has published the useful "Repertorium Germanicum", and, in co-operation with the Instituto Storico Italiano, the "Registrum chartarum Italiæ", a series of independent volumes. These researches take in Italian, German, French, English, and Spanish archives; Austria and Switzerland are likewise visited occasionally. The library of the institute ranks, with that of the Palazzo Farnese, among the best historical libraries in Rome.

===Hungary===
The "Hungaricorum Historicorum Collegium Romanum", no longer in existence, owed its inception in 1892 to the efforts of [[Monsignor Fraknói]], and published under his direction (since 1897) the "Monumenta Vaticana historiam regni Hungariæ illustrantia", whose two series in ten folio volumes are a lasting tribute to the munificence of Fraknói. Other noteworthy monographs based on Roman documents and illustrating the history of Hungary must be credited to this institute.

===Belgium===
{{main|Belgian Historical Institute in Rome}}
The "Institut historique Belge à Rome" was founded in 1902 and opened in 1904. It is now located in the [[Academia Belgica]]. The minister of state defined its purpose to be the searching of Italian archives, and especially those of the Vatican, for historical material bearing on [[Belgium]], and the publication of the results obtained. The project included a centre for individual Belgian investigators as well as for students assisted by the State, where all might find an adequate library and facilities for securing historical data of every kind. The institute, it was hoped, would eventually become an "Ecole des hautes études" for the study of ecclesiastical and profane history, classical philology, archæology, and the history of art. Its first director was Dom [[Ursmer Berlière]], of the Abbey of Maredsous (1904–1907); his successor was Dr [[Godefroid Kurth]], professor emeritus at the [[University of Liège]]. The institute has published numerous volumes of "Analecta Vaticano-Belgica".

===Netherlands===
The Netherland institute grew out of various historical commissions, the last of which was established 20 May 1904. Its two representatives, Dr. Brom and Dr. Orbaan, were appointed on 31 March 1906, director and secretary respectively of the state institute founded on this date, and of which they thus became the first members (Brom, "Nederlandsche gesehiedvorsching en Rome", 1903). This institute aims at a systematic investigation of Holland's ecclesiastical and political relations, and of her artistic, scientific, and economic relations, with Rome and Italy during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, a period of very great importance for Holland. A yearly report of the institute and its library appears at The Hague in "Verslagen omtrent's Rikjs onde archieven". Besides a number of essays and minor works, there appeared at The Hague, during 1908, a work by Brom, "Archivalia in Italie"; part I, Rome, "Vaticaansch Archief". All historical material in Italian archives bearing on the Netherlands will be concisely described in this series of volumes; the first part contains 2650 numbers, and is specially valuable because of the excellent conspectus it offers of the contents of the Vatican archives. A work by Orbaan, on Dutch scholars and artists in Rome, is ready for the press (1910).

==Other researches==
The institutes above-mentioned offer a very incomplete idea of the historical work done in the Vatican archives. Many Frenchmen, Germans, Austrians, Belgians, and others flock to Rome and spend much of their time in private investigations of their own. Most of these workers attach themselves to some institute and profit by its experience. Among Americans we may mention Professor Charles Homer Haskins, who familiarized himself with the treasures contained in the archives and library, and made a report on the same for the "American Historical Review", reprinted in the "Catholic University Bulletin", Washington, 1897, pp.&amp;nbsp;177–196; Rev. P. de Roo, who laboured for several years on the "Regesta" of Alexander VI; Heywood, who compiled the "Documenta selecta e tabulario Sanctæ Sedis, insulas et terras anno 1492 repertas a Christophoro Columbo respicientia", which he published in phototype in 1892. Other American scholars have profited largely by the immemorial academic hospitality of the popes. Special mention should be made here of the studies of Luka Jelic and Conrad Eubel concerning early missionary enterprises, and of an essay by Shipley on "The Colonization of America" (Lucerne, 1899). For other valuable information see the tenth volume of the "Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia". The time would seem to be at hand for the foundation of an American Catholic historical institute, which would take over the task of collecting and publishing in a systematic way the numerous important documents concerning the American Church preserved in many places at Rome, particularly in the Propaganda archives. Russia has sent historical commissions to Rome repeatedly, and for several years at a time. The names of Schmurlow, Brückner, Pierling, Forster, Wiersbowski, and others are sufficient reminders of the excellent work accomplished. From Japan came Dr. Murakami, to explore the Propaganda and Vatican archives for a history of the Catholic missions to Japan (1549–1690). Denmark is represented among the investigators by such names as Moltesen, Krarup, and Lindback; Norway by Storm, and Sweden by Tegnér, Elof, Karlson, and others. Moritz Stern, Felix Vernet, and others obtained at the Vatican material for a history of the Hebrews. The Spanish Government was long officially represented by the famous Spanish historian, Ricardo de Hinojosa, while researches in Portuguese history are conducted by MacSwiney. Switzerland entered into this peaceful competition by the labours of Kirsch and Baumgarten in 1899, and since the close of the last century many Swiss have visited Rome for Vatican researches, both as individuals and on official missions. We need only mention the names of Büchi, Wirz, Bernoulli, Steffens, Reinhard, and Stückelberg.

In addition to these and many more names, we must mention the numerous religious who seek in the archives fresh material for general ecclesiastical history, or the history of their order, e. g. the Benedictines and the Bollandists. The writer has observed at work in the archives during the last twenty-one years Dominicans, Jesuits, Franciscans, Minor Conventuals, Capuchins, Trinitarians, Cistercians, Benedictines, Basilians, Christian Brothers, Lateran Canons Regular, Vallombrosans, Camaldolese, Olivetans, Silvestrines, Carthusians, Augustinians, Mercedarians, Barnabites, and others. Women have at times secured temporary admittance, though for intelligible reasons this privilege is now restricted. Since 1879 the archives have welcomed Catholics, Protestants, Hebrews, believers and infidels, Christians and heathens, priests and laymen, men and women, rich and poor, persons of high social standing and plain citizens, of every nation and language. The writer is acquainted with nearly all the great archives of Europe, and knows that none of them afford similar facilities to the historical student or extend him more courtesy. The number of visitors is at all times higher than to other archives, while the freedom allowed in the use of the material is the most far-reaching known; practically nothing is kept hidden.

==Results of research==
It is not easy to determine which branch of historical science derives most benefit from Vatican research, nor is the question a simple one. Chronologically, there is no doubt that so far the most favoured period is that of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The sixteenth century comes next, much light being shed on it by the nunciature reports and the Acts of the Council of Trent. The seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries have hitherto been represented by few works, and these not very comprehensive. From the standpoint of subjects treated, Vatican research falls into three parts:

* (1) The study of the ecclesiastical relations of Rome with individual nations or peoples;
* (2) Roman ecclesiastical administration in all its details;
* (3) the influence exerted by the papacy on the civilized world, whether purely political or of a mixed political and religious nature.

If we consider the medieval period under the first of these subdivisions the results obtained are substantially as follows:

* (a) compilation of correct lists of bishops and [[titular bishop]]s;
* (b) investigation of the so-called [[Servitia]] (communia et secreta), i. e. of certain dues paid at Rome, among them [[pallium]] dues;
* (c) completer lists of bishoprics, abbeys, prelateships and churches directly subject to the Holy See;
* (d) lists, as complete as possible, of all kinds of papal ordinances, processes decisions, constitutions, and decrees;
* (e) study of the entire system of minor benefices in so far as affected by curial reservations;
* (f) selection from the petition files of all requests growing out of the said system;
* (g) reports of bishops on the state of their dioceses, and consistorial processes;
* (h) investigation into the influence of the Inquisition, to determine how far the respective local authorities were influenced by the Curia;
* (i) inquiry into the taxes imposed on clergy and Churches for purely ecclesiastical purposes, and into the ways and means of collecting these taxes.

For certain dioceses, ecclesiastical provinces, regions, or entire countries, all these data, together with other items of information, have in the course of time been gathered, and published, by individuals and by associations. They have also, in a general way, been made generally accessible by the publication, as a whole, of the respective papal registers (see [[Papal registers]]), e. g. the "Regesta" publications of the French institute, and the cameral (papal fiscal) reports of the Görres and Leo societies. "Chartularia", or collections of papal Bulls have been published not only for Westphalia, Eastern and Western Prussia, Utrecht, Bohemia, Salzburg, Aquileia, but also for Denmark, Poland, Switzerland, Great Britain, Ireland, and Germany (Repertorium Germanicum), not to speak of other countries. Many a student of the Vatican archives has devoted all his time to a single subject, e. g. Armellini, "Le Chiese di Roma"; Storm, "Die Obligationen der norwegischen Prälaten von 1311-1523"; Samaran-Mollat, "La fiscalité pontificale en France au l4me siècle"; Berlière, "Les 'Libri Obligationum et Solutionum' des archives vaticanes", for the Dioceses of Cambrai, Liège, Thérouanne, and Tournai; Rieder, "Römische Quellen zur Konstanzer Bisthumsgeschichte (1305-1378)".

The work done in the second subdivision is of the greatest importance for questions of history, [[canon law]], and general and medieval culture. The all-pervading activity of the medieval popes has been richly illustrated by various investigators, e. g. Göller on the records of the "Pœnitentiaria"; Kirsch and Baumgarten on the finances (officials, administration) of the College of Cardinals; Baumgarten on the respective offices of the vice-chancellor and the "Bullatores", the residence-quarters of the Curia, its Cursores or messengers; Watzl, Göller, and Schäfer on the finance bureau of the Curia; von Ottenthal on the secretaries and the "Chancery rules"; Tangl and Erler respectively on the "Chancery regulations" and the "Liber Cancellariæ"; Kehr, Berlière, and Rieder on the petition files (libelli supplices), etc. The student will find quite helpful illustration of these delicate labours in the remarkable editions of the "Liber Pontificalis" by Duchesne; the "Liber Censuum" by Duchesne-Fabre; the "Italia Pontificia" by Kehr; the "Hierarchia Catholica Medii Ævi" by Eubel; the "Catalogue of Cardinals" by Cristofori; the "Acts of the Council of Trent", by Ehses, Merkle, and Buschbell, not to speak of numerous other valuable works. As to the third subdivision, i. e. the purely political, or politico-ecclesiastical activities of the popes, no clearly defined distinction can be made, either in the Middle Ages or in more modern times, between these activities and the exercise of purely ecclesiastical authority; their numerous manifestations may be studied in the publications briefly described above. Abundant information is to be found in the publications of the papal "Regesta" and the "Camera" or treasury, records. We learn from them many curious items of profane history, e. g. the population of various kingdoms, grants of tithes to kings and rulers for political purposes, etc. The nunciature reports are rich in this information.

In a general way the Vatican archives and these new historical Roman institutes have been particularly helpful towards a better knowledge of the ecclesiastico-religious relations of individual dioceses, countries, and peoples with the head of the Church and its central administration. So numerous have been the results of investigation published along these lines, that it has hitherto been impracticable to prepare an exhaustive bibliography of the works based on studies in the Vatican archives. Melampo and Ranuzzi, following in the footsteps of Meister, have recently published a very useful, but not at all exhaustive, list of all the books and essays of this kind which had appeared up to 1900: "Saggio bibliografico dei lavori eseguiti nell' Archivio Vaticano" (Rome, 1909).

'''Sami Frashëri''' ({{lang-tr|Şemseddin Sami Bey}}; June 1, 1850 &amp;ndash; June 18, 1904) was an Ottoman [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[writer]], [[philosopher]], [[playwright]] and a prominent figure of the ''[[Rilindja Kombëtare]]'', the National Renaissance movement of [[Albania]], together with his two brothers [[Abdyl Frashëri|Abdyl]] and [[Naim Frashëri|Naim]]. He also supported [[Turkish nationalism]] against its Ottoman counterpart as well as [[Laïcité|laicism]] against theocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bozkurt Güvenç]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?ei=fdETTsDmD4SfmQWS5JWtDg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=GUlpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=T%C3%BCrk+milliyet%C3%A7isi+%22%C5%9Eemsettin+Sami%22&amp;q=%22%C5%9Eemsettin+Sami%22#search_anchor  Türk Kimliği]'', Kültür Bakanlığı, 1993, p. 32. {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Frashëri was one of the sons of an impoverished [[Bey]] from [[Frashër]] (Fraşer during the Ottoman rule) in the District of [[Përmet]]. He gained a place in [[Turkish literature#Ottoman literature|Ottoman literature]] as a talented author under the name of Şemseddin Sami [[Efendi]] and contributed to the [[Ottoman Turkish language]] reforms.

Frashëri's message, however as declared in his book "Albania - What it was, what it is, and what will become of it" published in 1899, became the manifesto of the Rilindja Kombëtare. He discussed the prospects for a united, free and independent republic of Albania. In this way, beginning with a demand for autonomy and struggle for their [[Albanian alphabet|own alphabet]] and education, Frashëri helped the Albanian National Movement develop its claim for independence. His lifetime goal, as that of many other members of the Albanian renaissance was the development and improvement of Albania's culture and eventual establishment of an independent country.

Sami Frashëri was born in 1850 in the village of [[Frashër]] in the [[Vilayet of Janina]] to a distinguished Muslim Albanian family of [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]] religious affiliations.&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt; Sami, alongside his brothers Naim, Abdyl and 5 other siblings were the children of Halit Bey (1797–1859)&lt;ref name="Elsie2005-67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Albanian Literature: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;pg=PA67|year=2005|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-031-4|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their paternal family traditions held that they were descendants of [[timar]] holders that hailed from the [[Berat]] region before coming to live in Frashër.&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt; While their mother Emine Hanım (1814–1861)&lt;ref name="Elsie2005-67"/&gt; was descended from [[Imrahor Ilyas Bey]], a distinguished 15th century Ottoman Albanian commander from the Korçë area.&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt; The surname of the family is derived from the village of Frashër.&lt;ref name="Tanner2004"/&gt; The settlement was noted in the late Ottoman era for having a mixed Albanian and Vlach population.&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nitsiakos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-7toRTGrFkC&amp;pg=PA142|page=142|title=On the Border|isbn=9783643107930|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thede Kahl and the [[Aromanians|Vlach]] community in Albania claim that the Frashëri family were of Vlach origin.&lt;ref name="Tanner2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arno Tanner|title=The Forgotten Minorities of Eastern Europe: The History and Today of Selected Ethnic Groups in Five Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQtCPAo1XU8C&amp;pg=PA213|year=2004|publisher=East-West Books|isbn=978-952-91-6808-8|pages=213–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethnologia Balkanica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ebpDLhkVWcC&amp;pg=PA150|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|pages=150–|id=GGKEY:ES2RY3RRUDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephanie Schwandner-Sievers|title=The Albanian Aromanians Awakening: Identity Politics and Conflicts in Post-Communist Albania|url=https://www.ciaonet.org/attachments/9172/uploads|date=March 1999|publisher=European Centre for Minority Issues|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sami began his studies at the Bektashi tekke in Frashër.&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt; Halit Bey and Emine died in 1859 and 1861 respectively.&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt; His older brother Abdul became head of the household and moved the whole family to [[Yannina|Yanina]].&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt; There Sami attended the [[Greek language]] [[Zosimea]] [[Gymnasium (school)|high school]].&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt; During that time he came in touch with western philosophy and studied [[Latin language|Latin]], [[ancient Greek|ancient]] and modern [[Greek language|Greek]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"/&gt; He also attended a local Muslim school and learned through lessons from teachers [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref name="Gawrych13"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+Saadi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AGWHSK5Fc0&amp;sig=JBGVpFnzKAt-JJkvSL9d-2oQbqc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO6suMwtbNAhWEi5QKHX6DBI8Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20crescent%20and%20the%20eagle%3A%20Ottoman%20rule%2C%20Islam%20and%20the%20Albanians%2C%201874-1913%20Saadi&amp;f=false 13].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frashëri was a bright student and finished an eight-year schooling program by graduating at the end of seven years.&lt;ref name="Gawrych1314"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=13-14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reflections of the Zosimea later in life was that it was "the perfect high school".&lt;ref name="Gawrych14"/&gt; Having received a broad education in a diverse socio-cultural and religious environment at the Zosimea and through private tutors, he gained the linguistic tools to emotionally and intellectually travel between cultures during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Gawrych14"/&gt;

In 1872 Sami and his brother Naim migrated to [[Istanbul]] and both got a job working for the Ottoman bureaucracy and as he admired [[French culture]] became involved in translating French language novels such as ''[[Les Misérables]]'' into Ottoman Turkish, later writing some short stories, plays and novels of his own.&lt;ref name="Gawrych14"/&gt; He was briefly posted in [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]] and in 1874 returned to Istanbul becoming a writer for a newspaper.&lt;ref name="Gawrych14"/&gt; Later in 1877 he went on another short assignment being posted briefly at [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref name="Gawrych14"/&gt; Returning to Istanbul he remained in the capital for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name="Gawrych14"/&gt; Frashëri emerged as an accomplished Ottoman-Albanian intellectual with a reputation of having an inquisitive and sharp intellect.&lt;ref name="Gawrych14"/&gt; He assisted in founding and serving as chief editor for several journals and newspapers.&lt;ref name="Gawrych14"/&gt; In Ottoman Turkish he wrote more than a dozen books like ''Insan'' (Human Being), ''Medeniyet-i Islamiye'' (Islamic Civilisation) and ''Kadınlar'' (Women).&lt;ref name="Gawrych14"/&gt; He compiled a French-Turkish (1882) and Turkish-French (1884) dictionary, an Arabic language dictionary (1898) and a two volume Ottoman Turkish dictionary (1899-1901) along with a six volume encyclopedia ''Kamus al Alam'' (1899-1899).&lt;ref name="Gawrych14"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Frashëri authored other publications in the Albanian language that included a pamphlet on the alphabet question, a reader, a grammar and a political treatise on the Albanian question titled ''Albania: What she has been, What she is, What she shall be''.&lt;ref name="Gawrych15127"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=15, 127.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Involvement in the Albanian national movement ===

==== The ''Besa yahut Ahde Vefa'' play ====

In Istanbul 1874 Frashëri wrote a play named ''Besâ yâhut Âhde Vefâ'' (Pledge of Honour or Loyalty to an Oath) in the Albanian language with themes based on an Albanian ethnicity, a bond to an ethnic based territory, ethno-cultural diversity as underlying Ottoman unity, honour, loyalty and self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Gawrych1283637"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=1-2, 8, 36-37.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play revolved around a betrothed girl kidnapped by a jealous villager that kills her father and whose mother vows revenge co-opting the culprit's father who gives his [[Besa (Albanian culture)|besa]] (pledge of honour) to help not knowing its his son, later killing him and himself ending with family reconciliation.&lt;ref name="Gawrych911"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=9-11.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frashëri's reasons for the play were to inform people about the morals, values, customs and traditions of Albanians whom he considered an important part of the empire and to create more local Ottoman theatre which he felt was dominated by foreign influences.&lt;ref name="Gawrych1281920164207"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=1-2, 8, 19-20, 164, 207.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was intended to present Albanians in a positive light to Ottoman and Albanian audiences that involved mainly [[Armenians]] directing and acting in roles with smaller numbers of [[Turkish people|Turks]] during its stage run.&lt;ref name="Gawrych1123637164207"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=1, 12, 36-37, 164, 207.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His play and its discussion of besa signified to more astute audiences the political implications of the concept and possible subversive connotations in future usage while it assisted Albanians in rallying militarily and politically around a national program.&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"/&gt; 

By 1901 his play was translated into Albanian by close friend Abdul Ypi and published in [[Sofia]] by [[Kristo Luarasi]] while it was part of the curriculum of the [[Mësonjëtorja|Albanian school in Korçë]] until its closure in 1902.&lt;ref name="Gawrych148149"/&gt; The themes of the play highlighting a besa for the self-sacrifice of the homeland carried a subversive message for Albanians to aim at unifying the nation and defending  the homeland, something Ottoman authorities also saw as fostering nationalist sentiments.&lt;ref name="Gawrych148149"/&gt; The Ottoman government placed the Albanian language version of the play on a list of books it deemed that "incite national sentiments of the Albanians" and during the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908 there were reports of Albanian guerillas acting out scenes around campfires.&lt;ref name="Gawrych148149"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=148-149.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frashëri's play would not appear in theatres until the aftermath of the 1908 Young Turk Revolution when performances continued for a full three years and during 1911-1912.&lt;ref name="Gawrych88164207"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=88, 164, 207.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== League of Prizren period ====
{{Pull quote|text=The Albanian Unionist Committee... has decided to erect a barrier against the penetration of Slavism and Greekism into Albania.|author=Sami Frashëri, 1878|source=&lt;ref name="Gawrych38"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=38.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}


During the [[Great Eastern Crisis]], the [[Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights]] was founded in 1877 and headed by elder brother Abdyl with Sami, [[Hasan Tahsini]], [[Pashko Vasa]] and [[Jani Vreto]] being members.&lt;ref name="Gawrych44"/&gt; The Committee aimed at the territorial unity and integrity of Albanian inhabited land within the Ottoman Empire with its members sending protests and visiting European embassies while urging Albanians in the Balkans to resist partition.&lt;ref name="Gawrych44"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=44.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1879, this committee formed a commission for the [[Albanian alphabet]]. The Committee appointed Sami along with Tahsini, Vasa and Vreto to create an Albanian alphabet.&lt;ref name="Gawrych59184"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=59, 184.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During discussions about the Albanian alphabet Frashëri and Vreto wanted the inclusion of a [[Greek alphabet]] character on the premise that Albanians and Greeks have the same ancestors, the [[Pelasgians]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kreutz. [http://www-brs.ub.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/netahtml/HSS/Diss/KreutzMichael/diss.pdf Modernismus und Europaidee in der Östlichen Mittelmeerwelt, 1821-1939]. p. 166. "Der bekannte intellektuelle Vordenker Sami Frashëri setzte sich wie Jan Vreto (Ioannis Vretos) für das Griechisch e ein, mit der Begründung, dass Albaner wie Griechen beidermassen Abkömmlinge der Pelasger seien."&lt;/ref&gt; Frashëri created a new Albanian alphabet based on the Latin script and a one letter, one sound principle that contained certain Greek letters and others invented by him for sounds that a Latin alphabet was unable to convey.&lt;ref name="Skendi140"/&gt; By 19 March 1879 the Society for Albanian Writings adopted Frashëri's 36 letter Istanbul alphabet consisting mostly of Latin characters that resulted in the publication of Albanian books and toward the late nineteenth century his alphabet had spread among Albanians.&lt;ref name="Skendi140"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=140.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych59"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=59.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June 1878 Sami was one of ten signatories to a memorandum addressed to [[Berlin Congress]] hosts chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] and [[Count Andrassy]] calling for reforms and Albanians to remain in the Ottoman state with their rights, desires, interests and traditions being respected.&lt;ref name="Gawrych47"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=47.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amidst this time Frashëri worked for the Ottoman newspaper ''[[Tercüman-ı Hakikat]]'' and he reported coverage on the geopolitical situation and events in Albania.&lt;ref name="Gawrych48"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=48.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published on 24 December 1878 about the Albanian question, he expressed that Albania was his special ''vatan'' (homeland) and he felt connected to the wider Ottoman motherland stressing that Albanians were loyal to the empire and ready to defend it.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5455"/&gt; He referred to two threats facing Albanians, one military due to irredentist claims of neighbouring powers on Albanian inhabited land and the other was cultural where [[South Slavs|Slavs]] and [[Greeks]] had established schools that used their languages in Albanian areas.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5455"/&gt; The solution for him was the unification of Albania into one vilayet (province) that could establish an effective resistance force.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5455"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=54-55.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frashëri continued to write a series of articles expanding his views by maintaining that Albanians wished to read and write in their language and those abilities he thought would allow Albanians protection from the influences of [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] and [[Pan-Slavism|Slavism]].&lt;ref name="Gawrych5556"/&gt; 

By 2 January 1879 he developed his thoughts further and stressed that the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] guaranteed this right to all peoples of the empire to read and write in ones native language.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5556"/&gt; Frashëri viewed the plight of his fellow Albanians as based upon poverty and ignorance that disadvantaged them when it came to dealing with Hellenism and Slavism.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5556209"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=55-56, 209.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered those factors as placing Albanians at risk of being severed from the empire for the benefits of foreign powers and peoples with Frashëri stating that both Christian and Muslim Albanians were thinking alike on these issues.&lt;ref name="Gawrych5556"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=55-56.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frashëri also founded and headed in Istanbul the [[Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings]] in October 1879, where Albanian scholastic books and texts were compiled by him and his brother [[Naim Frashëri|Naim]].&lt;ref name="Skendi119120"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"/&gt; He expressed that the Society had difficulties in its work due to a lack of "liberty" in the empire and for Frashëri the aims of the organisation went further then publishing books but to revive the Albanian language and unify its dialects.&lt;ref name="Skendi119120"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=119-120.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a correspondence of 1881 with [[Girolamo De Rada]] regarding the Albanian question Frashëri expressed sentiments supporting Albanian unity that transcended Muslim and Christian divisions with religion being separate from the state.&lt;ref name="Skendi166167"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=166-167.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1884 he had developed a reputation for championing the Albanian cause.&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"/&gt; The Society for Albanian Writings was forced to close by the Ottoman Government in 1885.&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"/&gt; In 1885, Frashëri managed to get permission from the Ottoman sultan for the opening of an [[Mësonjëtorja|Albanian boys school in Korçë]].&lt;ref name="Skendi134"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=134.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"/&gt; On 7 March 1887 it opened in [[Korçë]] with some two hundred enrolled students of Muslim and Christian faiths and due to a lack of education material Sami, his brother Naim and several other Albanians wrote textbooks in Albanian for the school.&lt;ref name="Gawrych88"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=88.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 he made an assessment of education in the [[Vilayet of Monastir]] claiming that Greeks, [[Bulgarians]] and [[Aromanians]] had more progressive schools and advanced education than Muslim Albanians.&lt;ref name="Gawrych93"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=93.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Between Ottomanism, Albanianism and Turkism ===

==== The ''Kamus al-A'lam'' encyclopedia ====

Between 1889 and 1899 Frashëri wrote a six volume encyclopedia ''Kamus al-A'lam'' written in Ottoman Turkish and was a scientific work of 4,380 pages.&lt;ref name="Gawrych96100101"/&gt; He sought to provide information about the Islamic world on famous individuals, geography and countries, demography, history, cultures from around world and other topics that he felt was minimally covered in Western publications.&lt;ref name="Gawrych96100101"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=96, 100-101.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia had a focus on Turks, [[Arabs]] and in particular the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] with Frashëri including detailed information for his readers on topics about Albania and Albanians.&lt;ref name="Gawrych96207"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=96, 207.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, one entry titled ''Arnavud'' (Albanian) was six pages and a total of eleven columns.&lt;ref name="Gawrych96"/&gt; The detailed article presented Albanians as an ancient Balkan people, older than Greeks and Latins that preserved in the mountains their customs such as the besa, traditions, language and an identity.&lt;ref name="Gawrych9799"/&gt; The assertion aimed to present Albanians as legitimate members of the community of nations during an era of nationalism.&lt;ref name="Gawrych99"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=99.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frashëri included information on the Venetian period, Ottoman conquest, conversion to Islam, attainment of Ottoman privileges and highlighting sacrifice and service to the state as soldiers, bureaucrats, in commerce and industry by Albanians.&lt;ref name="Gawrych9799"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=97-99.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Skanderbeg]], a fifteenth century warrior and his revolt against the Ottomans were described in a positive light as were the national and intellectual achievements of the Albanian diaspora in southern Italy.&lt;ref name="Gawrych97"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=97.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite regional differences of Ghegs and Tosks, Frashëri emphasized the unity of Albanians as speaking the same language with small dialectal differences.&lt;ref name="Gawrych98"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=98.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stressed the importance of developing Albanian language education and literature as a way of resisting encroachment from others through for example Hellenisation and as such urged authorities to allow Albanian national development.&lt;ref name="Gawrych9899"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=98-99.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with other entries on cities, towns, administrative units and others on Albanian topics Frashëri overall aimed in his encyclopedia to educate the general public about Albanians, to raise Albanian self-awareness and outline the geographical boundaries of Albania.&lt;ref name="Gawrych99101"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=99-101.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[Albanianism]] was also subtly developed within his encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="Gawrych127"/&gt;

[[File:BASA-1932K-1-433-11b.jpg|thumb|200px|Sami Frashëri, circa early 20th century]]
In comparison, the article ''Türk'' was three pages and five columns which underfeatured the importance and role of Turks in the empire when compared to Albanians.&lt;ref name="Gawrych96"/&gt; Tracing their history Frashëri described the Turks "as among Asia's biggest and most famous nations" numbering ten million and the Ottoman Empire as a "Turkish state".&lt;ref name="Gawrych96"/&gt; Apart from the prominence of Turks and Turkish culture, Frashëri stressed the ethnic and cultural diversity of the Ottoman Empire in his encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="Gawrych96"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=96.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That theme was embodied in the entry ''Ottoman'' a term Frashëri presented as originating from a great Turkish tribe with a change in meaning over time encompassing all Ottoman peoples and subjects, due to the Tanzimat reforms guided by a principle of equality.&lt;ref name="Gawrych9697"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=96-97.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After being involved with the Albanian movement during the League of Prizren period Frashëri increasingly came under suspicion by the Ottoman government over a number of times.&lt;ref name="Gawrych101"/&gt; In an investigation of 1890 into Frashëri by authorities, an acquaintance said that he and his brothers worked for eventual Albanian independence by first aiming to unite the Albanian inhabited vilayets into a unitary province within the empire.&lt;ref name="Gawrych101"/&gt; Ottoman authorities did not act against him and he published a further four volumes of his encyclopedia with the last being in 1899 while continuing with public and private discourses on Albania and Albanians.&lt;ref name="Gawrych101"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=101.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, the authors of the Ottoman government provincial almanac for Kosovo titled ''Kosova Salnamesi'' credited Frashëri and his encyclopedia as the source for most of their information.&lt;ref name="Gawrych114"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=114.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1899, a successor organisation to the Prizren League called [[League of Peja]] (Besa-Besë) had arisen and Frashëri again attempted to raise public discussion on Albania.&lt;ref name="Gawrych127"/&gt; He organised an Albanian Committee in Istanbul that supported lower taxes and use of Albanian in government schools in the region.&lt;ref name="Gawrych127"/&gt; These events saw his position with the state change rapidly and according to recollections by his children in later years a palace official had visited Frashëri at his home and restricted his movements while he was still employed by the government until his death.&lt;ref name="Gawrych127"/&gt;

In March 1899, Frashëri secretly completed an important booklet ''Albania: What she has been, What she is, What she shall be'' which outlined his geopolitical ideas on the Albanian question.&lt;ref name="Skendi129166169"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=129, 167-169.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych127"/&gt; The booklet was smuggled out of the Ottoman Empire and published in [[Bucharest]] with the identity of the author not appearing in the publication.&lt;ref name="Gawrych127"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=127.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers from [[Austro-Hungary]] printed some of Frashëri's most important works containing nationalist themes with Austro-Hungarian Albanologists [[Theodor Anton Ippen]] and Baron [[Nopcsa]] financing the translation and distribution of his publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Blumi |first1=Isa |title=Seeing Beyond the River Drin, Sarajevo, Ottoman Albanians and Imperial Rivalry in the Balkans after 1878 |url= http://www.kakanien.ac.at/beitr/fallstudie/IBlumi1.pdf |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |origyear= |year=2007 |month= |publisher= Kakanien revisited |location= Austria |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=6-7 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= s.

Declaring "I am an Albanian", his work derided identification of Muslim Albanians with Turks and Orthodox Albanians as [[Rûm|Rums]] while he opposed attempts by Greeks to hellenise them and seeking to incorporate [[Toskeri|Toskëria]] at a future date into Greece.&lt;ref name="Skendi167168"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=167-168.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych128"/&gt; He believed that Albania and the empire could no longer coexist in the same unit, even if there was a new period of prosperity due to a history of Ottoman prohibition on the development of an national Albanian identity and language.&lt;ref name="Skendi168"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych128"/&gt; Frashëri worried that Albania would not be able to preserve its nationality because of restrictions on Albanian schooling while at the same time the Porte was allowing rival national movements to act as they pleased, and that this would ultimately lead to the partition of Albania - hence, Albanians had to take matters into their own hands for self-preservation.&lt;ref name="Skendi168"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych128"/&gt; He preferred Albanian political unity and recognition of Albanian rights achieved by European powers exerting pressure on the empire than an anti-Ottoman revolt, as he thought the empire was on borrowed time and Albanians would need to prepare for creating an independent state.&lt;ref name="Skendi168"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=168.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych128"/&gt; Frashëri proposed that Albanians make a besa to demand the empire and Europe recognize Albanian national rights, especially by applying pressure upon the Ottomans to achieve those aims.&lt;ref name="Skendi168169"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=The+Albanian+National+Awakening&amp;ots=zGjQbVyql8&amp;sig=xsmbL-yAAtc-ny3v0E4vN87JOBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Sami%20Frash%C3%ABri&amp;f=false|isbn=9781400847761|pages=168-169.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych128"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=128.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He envisioned an autonomous Albanian state with a political parliamentary system, a capital called Skenderbey to be located in central Albania, an Albanian school system, two universities with one each in the north and south and an army of 20,000 men.&lt;ref name="Gawrych128131211"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=128, 131, 211.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nationalisation of the various faiths and sects was envisioned where Catholics would have their own archbishop, Muslims their mufti, Orthodox their Exarch, Bektashi their chief Baba with Jews and Protestants also worshiping in freedom.&lt;ref name="Gawrych128129"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=128-129.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The booklet by Frashëri overall was an articulation of political Albanianism.&lt;ref name="Gawrych129"/&gt;

==== Contributions to Turkism ====

Frashëri was a significant contributor to the development of Turkism.&lt;ref name="Gawrych129"/&gt; From the early 1880s he had an interest in the imperial Ottoman language as expressed in an article "The Ottoman Turkish Language" on 2 November 1881 where Frashëri argued that it was a [[Turkic languages|Turkish language]].&lt;ref name="Gawrych129"/&gt; These views would appear in articles published during the 1890s where he advocated for the imperial Ottoman language to be simplified and replaced by spoken Turkish, with words and grammatical structures stemming from Arabic and Persian being removed.&lt;ref name="Gawrych129"/&gt; Frashëri envisaged the emergence of a modern colloquial [[Turkish language]] from a disintegration of the imperial Ottoman language that would have benefit wider society.&lt;ref name="Gawrych129"/&gt; Frashëri published an Ottoman Turkish dictionary ''Kamus i Türki'' and in its first two volumes in 1899 he expressed in an introduction that Western Turkish or Ottoman was the same language as its Eastern Turkish counterpart or Cagatay.&lt;ref name="Gawrych129"/&gt; The differences for him was that Western Turkish had absorbed Persian, Arabic, Italian and Greek words which Frashëri thought was unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Gawrych129"/&gt; For him the dictionary was the wealth of a language and as other languages possessed their dictionaries Frashëri viewed Turkish as in need of its own dictionary to preserve unique linguistic attributes.&lt;ref name="Gawrych129"/&gt; Embracing Turkish as "our language", Frashëri stuck to his Albanian heritage by affirming an Albanian identity and commitment to Albanianism in the dictionary.&lt;ref name="Gawrych129"/&gt; In word entries on Albania and Albanians he included definitions on being Albanian such as the term Albanianism where an example of its use in an sentence was rendered as "He is not denying his Albanianism/Albanianess" (Arnavudluğunu inkur etmiyor).&lt;ref name="Gawrych129"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=129.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The choice of wording by Frashëri in labeling the language Turkish as opposed to Ottoman assisted to nurture a national identity among Turkish people.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; For him his idea of the Ottoman Empire was for [[Abdul Hamid II]] to emphasize [[Ottomanism]] over [[Pan-Islamism|Islamism]] and incorporate concepts like Turkism and Albanianism into the state framework allowing cultural pluralism with Albanians and Turks each developing their own languages and teaching them in schools.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; He considered cultural and ethnic diversity of the Muslim community as factors that would strengthen Ottoman unity.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; Frashëri, after several years of work published a 500-page Arabic dictionary (Kamus-i Arabi) in 1896 and he also noted that Kurdish lacked a dictionary but was unable to compile it as he lacked linguistic skills in the language.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; Stories of him working on an Albanian dictionary existed during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; He failed however to produce one and George Gawrych holds that probably due to the work of his friend [[Konstantin Kristoforidhi]] whose Albanian dictionary was published in 1904 he choose to let it be the standard version.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; 

Sami Frashëri also played a role in the later developing Turkish nationalist movement, by translating the works of European [[Turkology]] into Turkish and transmitting their Western ideas to Turk audiences.&lt;ref name="Bilmez361"/&gt; These works would serve as a basis for an emerging Turkish identity, and the early Turkish nationalists were grateful for them.&lt;ref name="Bilmez361"/&gt; He had close relationships with Turkish nationalist intellectuals [[Veled Çelebi İzbudak|Veled Çelebi]] (İzbudak) and [[Necip Asım Yazıksız|Necip Asım]] (Yazıksız) and maintained friendships with the writers and publisher of the journal ''İkdam'' which contributed to the spread of cultural Turkism and promotion of nationalism within Turkey.&lt;ref name="Bilmez361"/&gt;

== Legacy ==

Frashëri died on 18 June 1904 aged fifty four&lt;ref name="Gawrych15130"/&gt; after a severe illness at his home in [[Bağdat Avenue|Erenköy]], [[Istanbul]]. He left a number of unpublished manuscripts relating to Turkish studies.&lt;ref name="Gawrych15"/&gt; Due to his envedours and work within that field it has earned him a place within Ottoman intellectual history.&lt;ref name="Gawrych15"/&gt; During his lifetime Frashëri admired European culture and its intellectual achievements while he sought respect and dignity for his Albanian background being himself loyal to the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Gawrych15"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=15.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an Ottoman, like many other Albanians he negotiated the daily reality of the multi-ethnic, linguistic and religious realities of his time appreciating and supporting the diversity of the state while also advocating for Albanianism.&lt;ref name="Gawrych3"/&gt; He was devoted to both ''vatans'' (homelands), the wider Ottoman and his special Albanian one.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; Frashëri moved socially and intellectually through various communities of Istanbul while having an appreciation of Islam and traditions originating from Arabs and the Ottoman sociopolitical and cultural systems.&lt;ref name="Gawrych131"/&gt; Along with other Albanians, Albanianism with Ottomanism were seen as being compatible.&lt;ref name="Gawrych3"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a cultural and political activist Frashëri however ran into trouble with the Ottoman government.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; Over time he developed a disillusionment with the regime of sultan Abdul Hamid II and increasingly turned to Albanianism.&lt;ref name="Gawrych131"/&gt; Being an Albanian Tosk he felt frustration with his fellow Albanian Ghegs and other conservative and traditionalist Albanians whom he thought were more preoccupied with regional and local matters than with the national issues.&lt;ref name="Gawrych131"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=131.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frashëri did not want Albanians to be confused for Turks and he worked to foster the national identities of both ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; At times tensions existed for him when the categories of Ottomanism and Albanianism and of Turk and Albanian were not in balance.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; As scholar Francis Trix put it he was "an Ottoman reformer [who] could be both an Albanian patriot and, at the same time, a cultural Turk of the highest order".&lt;ref name="Gawrych130299"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

After his death individuals and diverse groups both honoured and claimed him as theirs.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; Among Turkish circles, the Young Turk newspaper ''Osmanlı'' published in [[Geneva]] described him in their full front-page obituary as a scholar and great humanritarian that "honored Ottomanism (Osmanlılık)."&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"/&gt; [[Yusuf Akçura]], an advocate of Turkism and contemporary of Frashëri considered him as a Turkish nationalist.&lt;ref name="Gawrych130"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=130.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanians of the era regarded Frashëri as a patriot, while due to his contributions toward developing a national [[Albanian literature]] modern Albanian historians view him as an Albanian nationalist.&lt;ref name="Gawrych15130"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=15, 130.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the works of Frashëri contain nationalistic discourse, following his death they have retained the attention of the public during different time periods and governments in Albania and Turkey.&lt;ref name="Bilmez361"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bilmez|first=Bülent|chapter=Shemseddin Sami Frashëri (1850-1904): Contributing to the Construction of Albanian and Turkish Identities|editor1-last=Mishkova|editor1-first=Diana|title=We, the people: politics of national peculiarity in Southeastern Europe|year=2009|location=|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=9789639776289|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=pbi_wzu7QAMC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=363.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Turkish literary history Frashëri is revered as being a forefather of [[Turkish literature]] and a significant innovator for the Turkish language.&lt;ref name="Brunnbauer109"/&gt; In Albanian collective memory he is cherished as a founding father of Albanian literature and as one of the rilindjas (national awakeners) of the Albanian nation.&lt;ref name="Brunnbauer109"/&gt; An Ottoman historian [[Kemal Karpat]] summed up his complex identity as "Sami considered himself a 'Turk' because he was a member of the Ottoman state, and he saw no conflict between his Ottoman political identity and his Albanian ethnicity."&lt;ref name="Gawrych130299"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=130, 229.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four surviving children of Frashëri remained in Turkey and due to their commitment to the republic Turkish authorities decided in the 1950s not to allow the remains of Sami to leave the country for Albania.&lt;ref name="Gawrych200"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gawrych|first=George|title=The Crescent and the Eagle: Ottoman rule, Islam and the Albanians, 1874–1913|year=2006|location=London|publisher=IB Tauris|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+lexicon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT94zl8ebXAhWJT7wKHYRLADEQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Sami&amp;f=false|isbn=9781845112875|pages=200.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Ali Sami Yen]] (1886–1951), was a footballer and founder of [[Galatasaray SK]] and chairman of Galatasaray&lt;ref name="Brunnbauer109"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brunnbauer|first=Ulf|chapter=Moving Subjects: The Translocal Nature of Southeastern European History|editor1-last=Promitzer|editor1-first=Christian|editor2-last=Gruber|editor2-first=Siegfried|editor3-last=Heppner|editor3-first=Harald|title=Southeast European Studies in a Globalizing World|year=2014|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=9783643905956|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ichTBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Southeast+European+Studies+in+a+Globalizing+World&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjapq-co4zbAhXFwbwKHVuVDAEQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ali%20Sami&amp;f=false|pages=109|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1905–18 and 1925–6.

Nowadays, a lot of schools bear his name, i.e. [[Sami Frashëri High School]] is one of the most well-known gymnasium in [[Prishtina]] and another in [[Tirana]], and in other localities like [[Bogovinje]], [[Republic of Macedonia]] and so on.

}}
{{Nihongo|'''Takuji Iwasaki'''|岩崎 卓爾|Iwasaki Takuji|November 17, 1869 – May 2, 1937}} was a Japanese meteorologist, biologist, ethnologist historian. He was a meteorologist at the Ishigaki Weather Station, [[Ishigaki, Okinawa|Ishigaki]], [[Okinawa Prefecture]]. Initially, when weather forecasting was in its infancy, he had been badly criticized by local people when his forecast of a [[typhoon]] was incorrect. Nevertheless, his work as a meteorologist was better understood by locals later in his career, which endeared him to people.

==Other names==
Takuji was also known as 糸数原主人袋風荘主人,蝶仙、蝶翁. He was also called "天文屋の御主前" (tenbunyah no ushumai), meaning master of the weather observatory, or "nahbera no ushumai" (literal: master of sponge cucumber).

==Life==
Takuji was born on October 17, 1869, to a family of [[samurai]] in [[Sendai]], a city in the [[Miyagi Prefecture]]. He discontinued high school and became a trainee at the Central Meteological Station (now the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]). He also worked at the weather stations of [[Nemuro Subprefecture|Nemuro]] and [[Sapporo]]. Takuji was stationed at the Ishigaki Weather Observatory (now Ishigaki Weather Station) in the southern [[Ryukyu Islands]] 1899 when he married. In 1900, he became the second director of the observatory, and had remained in Ishigaki until his death.

While he was stationed at the observatory in [[Ishigaki, Okinawa|Ishigaki]], Takuji studied various unrelated fields including society, traditions, and natural sciences related to Ishigaki. He became the director of [[Yaeyama District, Okinawa|Yaeyama]] Library, which later became the Yaeyama branch of the Okinawa Prefectural Library. He started the first kindergarten on the island, and took part in a venture enterprise of culturing black pearls in [[Kabira Bay]] with [[Mikimoto Kōkichi]]. One of Takuji's weaknesses was language. He only spoke a [[Sendai]] dialect, and up until his death, conversation with local people was very difficult.

In 1932, Takuji retired from the Ishigaki Observatory but remained as a part-time worker. Then living in Tonoshiro, Ishigaki, he named his house "Fukurokaze Soh". He died there on May 2, 1937, at the age of 69.

In 2001, Takuji was made an honorary citizen of Ishigaki.

==Achievements==
Takuji proposed that all buildings in typhoon-prone Ishigaki Island be built in concrete, including his observatory. This became a reality in 1915, and now almost all buildings in Ishigaki are erected in concrete. He observed every typhoon which hit Ishigaki Island, and during one storm in 1914, a small stone hit his right eye and he lost his sight in that eye.

Takuji has been famous for his studies in the fields of biology. With the help of scholars such as [[Yasushi Nawa]] and [[Matsutoshi Matsumura]], many new species were discovered, including several species called ''Iwasaki'' in Japanese.

As for insects, Takuji discovered and named ''Iwasaki Ootoge Kamemushi'', ''Iwasaki Kamemushi'', ''Iwasaki Kusazemi'', ''Iwasaki Kinsuji Kamikiri'', ''Iwasaki Konoha'', ''Iwasaki Shirocho'', ''Iwasaki Zemi'', ''Iwasaki Himeharuzemi'', ''Iwasaki Herikamemushi'', and ''Iwasaki Kusazemi''. He also bred butterflies such as "Oogomadara" and ''Konoha Cho'', and observed their behaviour. The Japanese name "Oogomadara" means "paper kite" or the "rice paper butterfly", ''[[Idea leuconoe]]'', and is known especially for its presence in butterfly greenhouses and live butterfly expositions. The paper kite butterfly has its origins in Southeast Asia. 

Snakes named in honor of  Takuji include ''Iwasaki Sedaka Hebi'' (''[[Pareas iwasakii]]'' )&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Iwasaki", p. 131).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Iwasaki Wamon Beni Hebi'' (''[[Calliophis macclellandi]] iwasakii'' ). He bred the poisonous ''Sakishima habu'' (''[[Trimeresurus elegans]]'') and devised ways to cope with the snake.

Takuji had collected a number of folklore and local songs, and tried to introduce the culture of Ishigaki Island through ''[[Yanagida Kunio]]'' and ''[[Origuchi Nobuo]]''.

'''The Valley''' is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Anguilla]], one of its fourteen [[Districts of Anguilla|districts]], and the main town on the island. {{As of|2011}}, it had a population of 1,067.&lt;ref name="statistics census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.ai/statistics/census/Housing%20and%20Household.htm|title=Number of Dwellings and Persons for Censuses 1974 – 2001 (Table 2)|publisher=Statistics Department of Anguilla|accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Historical landmarks===
The Valley has few examples of colonial architecture due to the relocation of Anguilla's administration to [[Saint Kitts|St. Kitts]] in 1825, though [[Wallblake House]], built in 1787, still stands and is used as a [[rectory]] by the adjacent [[Church (building)|church]]. New shops have opened in new buildings and renovated West Indian-style cottages. Old shops have been modernized and have enlarged their stocks as well as their space.

The ruins of the Old Court House are located on Crocus Hill, the island's highest point. All that remains are the broken walls of a few basement jail cells. At Cross Roads at the western edge of The Valley is Wallblake House, a plantation home built around 1787 that is now owned by the Catholic Church (the parish priest lives there) and St. Gerard's Catholic Church, with its highly original façade of pebbles, stones, cement, wood and tile.

==Geography==

===Location===
The town is located in the middle of the island, in front of [[Crocus Bay]] and nearby [[Crocus Hill]], the island's highest point. Nearest villages are [[North Side, Anguilla|North Side]], [[The Quarter, Anguilla|The Quarter]], [[North Hill, Anguilla|North Hill]] and [[George Hill, Anguilla|George Hill]].

===Climate===
The Valley has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] (Aw) under the [[Köppen climate classification]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=66887&amp;cityname=The+Valley%2C+The+Valley%2C+Anguilla&amp;units= Climate Summary for The Valley, Anguilla]&lt;/ref&gt; The area has a short [[dry season]] that covers the months of February and April, and a [[wet season]] that covers the remainder of the year. However the wet season, though lengthy, does not quite see the heavy precipitation that is commonplace in other Caribbean cities such as [[Santo Domingo]] and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. Average temperatures in The Valley are relatively constant throughout the year, ranging from 26–29 degrees Celsius.

'''Thegan of Trier''' (or '''Degan of Treves''') (before 800&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Thomas F.X., ed. "Charlemagne and Louis the Pious: the lives by Einhard, Notker, Ermoldus, Thegan, and the Astronomer". Penn State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; – ca. 850) was a [[Francia|Frankish]] [[Roman Catholic]] prelate and the author of '''''Gesta Hludowici imperatoris''''' which is a principal source for the life of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Louis the Pious]], the son and successor of [[Charlemagne]].

==Biography==
Very little is known of Thegan's life; he appears to have come from a noble Frankish family in the middle [[Rhine]]-[[Moselle]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Tremp 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been educated at [[Lorsch Abbey|Lorsch]].&lt;ref&gt;Noble.&lt;/ref&gt; All that is certain is that by 825 he was [[chorbishop|auxiliary bishop]] of [[Bishop of Trier|Trier]]&lt;ref&gt;Noble.&lt;/ref&gt; and probably ''[[praepositus]]'' of the monastery of St. Cassius in [[Bonn]]. He was also a warm friend of [[Walafrid Strabo]], who was the earliest editor of Thegan's ''Gesta'' and divided it into chapters, just as he did with [[Einhard]]'s ''[[Vita Karoli]]''. Walafrid also gave it the name by which it is known: ''Gesta et Laudes'' ("Deeds and Praise"), which he mentions in his prologue. &lt;ref&gt;''MGH SS rer. Germ.'' 64 'Walahfridi Prologus' 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some poetry and a single letter from Thegan survive. This letter is written to one Hatto who was a count in the Rhine region of [[Kreuznach]], and an important broker in the effort to reconcile Louis the Pious with his son [[Louis the German]] in the mid-830s.&lt;ref&gt;Innes, M. ''State and Society in the Early Middle Ages'' (Cambridge, 2000) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; This concern to promote accord between Louis and his son is similarly evident in the ''Gesta''.

Thegan died between 848 and 853.&lt;ref&gt;Noble.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Gesta Hludowici Imperatoris''==
Thegan wrote his history of Louis the Pious, translated as "The Deeds of Emperor Louis," in 836-7. The text is a narrative in unpolished Latin, as judged by the standards of the day,&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Mitchell, reviewing Tremp 1988 in ''Speculum'' '''65'''.4 (October 1990:1066). Walafrid also feels it necessary to excuse the poor scholarship in his prologue, claiming that Thegan has been occupied with other ecclesiastical matters. ''MGH SS rer. Germ.'' 64 'Walahfridi Prologus' 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; written with hortatory intent and based on personal knowledge and communication with friends. Prefaced by a brief prologue by Walafrid Strabo, the ''Gesta'' begins with an account of Saint [[Arnulf of Metz]], describes the vicissitudes of the brothers of Louis and gives a more detailed account of Louis' reign during the years 814-835. The later narrative is probably a continuation by another author.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The account is clearly partisan. The merits of Louis himself are exalted, though his councillors and Louis' poor judgement in taking their advice, are denigrated, while the actions of Louis' son [[Lothair I, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]] and of a number of bishops, especially Bishop [[Ebbo of Reims]], are severely criticised.&lt;ref&gt;Thegan refers to Ebbo in terms such as "vile peasant" and includes an extended tirade directed at Ebbo in ch. 44. Dutton, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; So virulent is Thegan's depiction of Ebbo that Walafrid feels it necessary to make excuses for it in his short prologue.

Thegan's strong dislike for Ebbo has been attributed by most modern historians to Ebbo's low birth and his contribution to the rebellion which deposed Louis briefly. More recently, Tremp has suggested that Ebbo was making an attempt to reform the chorepiscopate and that this was an additional reason that he incurred Thegan's hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Tremp, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the reason behind it, it is clear from the text that Thegan's dislike for Ebbo is of a very personal nature.

==Dissemination==
The text was not widely read during Thegan's lifetime but became far more popular during the reign of [[Charles the Bald]]. Rosamund McKitterick has suggested that this can be seen as part of the preoccupation of later [[Carolingian]] kings to construct a historical image for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;In both ''Carolingian Culture'' (1994) and ''History and Memory in the Carolingian World'' (2004) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Thegan's text is most frequently found as part of manuscripts containing texts such as the [[Royal Frankish Annals]], genealogies of the Carolingians and a history of the Trojans, and very often the ''[[Vita Hludovici]]'' of the anonymous author known as The Astronomer.

==Modern editions==
The ''Gesta'' has been translated into German by Ernst Tremp in the series ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Scriptores in Rerum Germanicarum in usum Scholarum separatim editi''. An English translation is available in the volume ''Carolingian Civilization: A reader'' by Paul Dutton.

'''Sir Thomas More'''&lt;!-- Please don't change this to "Saint", which is a controversial title at best --&gt; (7 February 1478{{spaced ndash}} 6 July 1535), [[veneration|venerated]] in the [[Catholic Church]] as '''Saint Thomas More''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://savior.org/saints/more.htm St. Thomas More, 1478–1535] at Savior.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasmorestudies.org/rep_canonization.html Homily at the Canonization of St. Thomas More] at The Center for Thomas More Studies at the University of Dallas, 2010, citing text "Recorded in The Tablet, June 1, 1935, pp. 694–695"&lt;/ref&gt; was an English lawyer, [[social philosopher]], author, [[Politician|statesman]], and noted [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]]. He was also a councillor to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor of England]] from October 1529 to 16 May 1532.&lt;ref&gt;Linder, Douglas O.

More opposed the [[Protestant Reformation]], in particular the theology of [[Martin Luther]] and [[William Tyndale]]. More also opposed the king's separation from the [[Catholic Church]], refusing to acknowledge Henry as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] and the annulment of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]]. After refusing to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]], he was convicted of [[treason]] and beheaded. Of his execution, he was reported to  have said: "I die the King's good servant, but God's first".

[[Pope Pius XI]] canonised More in 1935 as a [[martyrs|martyr]]. [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2000 declared him the "heavenly [[patron saint|Patron]] of Statesmen and Politicians".&lt;ref name=JP2PatronSaint /&gt; Since 1980, the [[Church of England]] has remembered More liturgically as a Reformation martyr.&lt;ref name="CofEholyDays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx|title=Holy Days|work=Worship – The Calendar|publisher=[[Church of England]]|year=2011|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] honoured him for the purportedly [[communist]] attitude toward property rights expressed in ''Utopia''.&lt;ref name=Margaret-L-King01a /&gt;&lt;ref name=University-of-Dallas01a /&gt;&lt;ref name=afoniya01a /&gt;

== Early life ==

{{Catholic philosophy}}
Born in Milk Street in London, on 7 February 1478, Thomas More was the son of [[John More (judge)|Sir John More]],&lt;ref&gt;Jokinen, A. (June 13, 2009). [http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/morebio.htm "The Life of Sir Thomas More."] Luminarium. Retrieved on: 19 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a successful lawyer and later a judge, and his wife Agnes (''née'' Graunger). He was the second of six children. More was educated at St Anthony's School, then considered one of London's finest schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/thomas-more-9414278|title=Sir Thomas More|work=The Biography Channel website|publisher= |year=2014|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1490 to 1492, More served [[John Morton (cardinal)|John Morton]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and Lord Chancellor of England, as a household page.&lt;ref name="Rebhorn"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Rebhorn|editor-first=Wayne A|title=Utopia|place=New York|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|series=Classics|year=2005|chapter=Introduction}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xvi}} Morton enthusiastically supported the "[[New Learning]]" (scholarship which was later known as "humanism" or "London humanism"), and thought highly of the young More. Believing that More had great potential, Morton nominated him for a place at the [[University of Oxford]] (either in [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St. Mary Hall]] or [[Canterbury College, Oxford|Canterbury College]], both now gone).&lt;ref name="Ackroyd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|title=The Life of Thomas More|place=New York|publisher=Anchor Books|year=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}}

More began his studies at Oxford in 1492, and received a classical education. Studying under [[Thomas Linacre]] and [[William Grocyn]], he became proficient in both Latin and Greek. More left Oxford after only two years—at his father's insistence—to begin legal training in London at New Inn, one of the [[Inns of Chancery]].&lt;ref name="Rebhorn" /&gt;{{rp|xvii}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harpsfield|first=Nicholas|title=The Life and Death of Sr Thomas More|place=London|publisher=Early English Text Society|year=1931|pages=12–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1496, More became a student at Lincoln's Inn, one of the [[Inns of Court]], where he remained until 1502, when he was [[call to the bar|called to the Bar]].&lt;ref name="Rebhorn" /&gt;{{rp|xvii}}

== Spiritual life ==
According to his friend, theologian [[Desiderius Erasmus]] of [[Rotterdam]], More once seriously contemplated abandoning his legal career to become a [[monk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erasmus|first=Desiderius|author-link=Desiderius Erasmus|contribution=Letter to Ulrich von Hutten|editor-last=Adams|editor-first=Robert M.|title=Utopia|location=New York|publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erasmus to Ulrich von Hutten|work=The Center for Thomas More Studies. Biographical Accounts: Erasmus' Letters about More|url=http://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/Erasmus%20to%20Ulrich%20von%20Hutten.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Thomasmorestudies.org|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1503 and 1504 More lived near the [[London Charterhouse|Carthusian monastery]] outside the walls of London and joined in the monks' spiritual exercises. Although he deeply admired their piety, More ultimately decided to remain a layman, standing for election to Parliament in 1504 and marrying the following year.&lt;ref name="Rebhorn" /&gt;{{rp |xxi}}

More continued [[asceticism|ascetic]] practices for the rest of his life, such as wearing a [[cilice|hair shirt]] next to his skin and occasionally engaging in flagellation.&lt;ref name="Rebhorn" /&gt;{{rp |xxi}} A tradition of the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]] honours More as a member of that Order on their [[calendar of saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taucrossregion.org/calendarfranciscansaints.htm|work=Tau Cross Region of the Secular Franciscan Order|title=Franciscan Calendar|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505201117/http://www.taucrossregion.org/calendarfranciscansaints.htm|archivedate=5 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family life ==
[[File:More famB 1280x-g0.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Rowland Lockey]] after [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''The Family of Sir Thomas More'', c. 1594]]

More married Jane Colt in 1505.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp |118}} [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] reported that More wanted to give his young wife a better education than she had previously received at home, and tutored her in music and literature.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp |119}} The couple had four children before Jane died in 1511: [[Margaret Roper|Margaret]], Elizabeth, Cicely, and John.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp |132}}

Going "against friends' advice and common custom," within thirty days More had married one of the many eligible women among his wide circle of friends.&lt;ref name=Wegemer&gt;{{cite book|title=Thomas More: A Portrait of Courage|author=Gerard B. Wegemer|year=1995|publisher=Scepter Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wagner&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_c_md3gMpwC |title=Encyclopedia of Tudor England |author1=John A. Wagner |author2=Susan Walters Schmid |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2011 |isbn=1598842994 |pages=769–770}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose [[Alice More|Alice Harpur Middleton]] to head his household and care for his small children.&lt;ref&gt;Maddison, the Rev. Canon, A.R., M.A., F.S.A., editor, ''Lincolnshire Pedigrees'', Harleian Society, London, 1903, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of the marriage was so unusual that More had to get a dispensation of the [[Banns of marriage|banns]], which, due to his good public reputation, he easily obtained.&lt;ref name=Wegemer /&gt;

More had no children from his second marriage, although he raised Alice's daughter from her previous marriage as his own. More also became the guardian of two young girls: Anne Cresacre would eventually marry his son, John More;&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|146}} and [[Margaret Clement|Margaret Giggs]] (later Clement) would be the only member of his family to witness his execution (she died on the 35th anniversary of that execution, and her daughter married More's nephew [[William Rastell]]). An affectionate father, More wrote letters to his children whenever he was away on legal or government business, and encouraged them to write to him often.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|150}}&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Rogers|editor-first=Elizabeth Frances|first=St Thomas|last=More|title=Selected Letters|place=New Haven and London|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xiv}}

More insisted upon giving his daughters the same classical education as his son, a highly unusual attitude at the time.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp |146–47}} His eldest daughter, Margaret, attracted much admiration for her erudition, especially her fluency in Greek and Latin.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|147}} More told his daughter of his pride in her academic accomplishment in September 1522, after he showed the bishop a letter she had written:

{{quote|When he saw from the signature that it was the letter of a lady, his surprise led him to read it more eagerly … he said he would never have believed it to be your work unless I had assured him of the fact, and he began to praise it in the highest terms … for its pure Latinity, its correctness, its erudition, and its expressions of tender affection. He took out at once from his pocket a portague [A Portuguese gold coin] … to send to you as a pledge and token of his good will towards you.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;{{rp|152}}}}

More's decision to educate his daughters set an example for other noble families. Even Erasmus became much more favourable once he witnessed their accomplishments.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|149}}

A portrait of More and his family was painted by Holbein, but it was lost in a fire in the 18th century. More's grandson commissioned a [[Sir Thomas More and Family|copy]], of which two versions survive.

== Early political career ==
[[File:Study for portrait of the More family, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|Study for a portrait of Thomas More's family, c. 1527, by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]

In 1504 More was elected to Parliament to represent [[Great Yarmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Yarmouth]], and in 1510 began representing [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/more-thomas-i-147778-1535| title=History of Parliament| publisher=History of Parliament Trust|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1510, More served as one of the two [[undersheriff]]s of the [[City of London]], a position of considerable responsibility in which he earned a reputation as an honest and effective public servant. More became [[Master of Requests (England)|Master of Requests]] in 1514,&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson (ed.) ''Chambers Biographical Dictionary'' (1990) p. 1039&lt;/ref&gt; the same year in which he was appointed as a [[Privy Counsellor]].&lt;ref name=rebhorn&gt;Rebhorn, W. A. (ed.) p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; After undertaking a diplomatic mission to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], accompanying [[Thomas Wolsey]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Archbishop of York]], to [[Calais]] and [[Bruges]], More was knighted and made under-treasurer of the [[Exchequer]] in 1521.&lt;ref name=rebhorn /&gt;

As secretary and personal adviser to [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], More became increasingly influential: welcoming foreign diplomats, drafting official documents, and serving as a liaison between the King and Lord Chancellor Wolsey. More later served as [[High Steward (academia)|High Steward]] for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.

In 1523 More was elected as [[knight of the shire]] (MP) for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]] and, on Wolsey's recommendation, the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] elected More its [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]].&lt;ref name=rebhorn /&gt; In 1525 More became [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], with executive and judicial responsibilities over much of northern England.&lt;ref name="rebhorn" /&gt;

== Chancellorship ==
After [[Thomas Wolsey|Wolsey]] fell, More succeeded to the office of [[Lord Chancellor]] in 1529. He dispatched cases with unprecedented rapidity.

=== Campaign against the Protestant Reformation ===
[[File:HouseOfMore.JPG|thumb|Sir Thomas More is commemorated with a sculpture at the late-19th-century Sir Thomas More House, opposite the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], Carey Street, London.]]

More supported the [[Catholic Church]] and saw the [[Protestant Reformation]] as [[heresy]], a threat to the unity of both church and society. More believed in the theology, argumentation, and ecclesiastical laws of the church, and "heard Luther's call to destroy the Catholic Church as a call to war."&lt;ref name="Gerard"&gt;Gerard B. Wegemer, ''Portrait of Courage'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

His early actions against the Protestant Reformation included aiding Wolsey in preventing Lutheran books from being imported into England, spying on and investigating suspected Protestants, especially publishers, and arresting anyone{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} holding in his possession, transporting, or selling the books of the Protestant Reformation. More vigorously suppressed [[William Tyndale|Tyndale's]] [[Tyndale Bible|English translation of the New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J90cWIBoAPcC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=Thomas+More+suppressed+Tyndale+bible&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilyK_exaLVAhVD74MKHdNCBQYQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomas%20More%20suppressed%20Tyndale%20bible&amp;f=false |title=The Cambridge History of Early Modern English Literature |editor1=David Loewenstein |editor2=Janel Mueller |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0521631564 |page=93 (footnote 36)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tyndale Bible used controversial translations of certain words that More considered heretical and seditious; for example, it used "senior" and "elder" rather than "priest" for the Greek "''{{lang|grc|presbyteros}}''", and used the term ''congregation'' instead of ''church'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCwpDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA547&amp;dq=Thomas+More+suppressed+Tyndale+translation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-683IxqLVAhWD6IMKHavYCO0Q6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomas%20More%20suppressed%20Tyndale%20translation&amp;f=false |title=The Oxford Handbook of Early Modern English Literature and Religion |editor1=Andrew Hiscock |editor2=Helen Wilcox |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2017 |isbn=019165342X |page=547}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also pointed out that some of the marginal glosses challenged Catholic doctrine.&lt;ref name="MoynahanBrian"&gt;Moynahan, Brian, ''God's Bestseller: William Tyndale, Thomas More, and the Writing of the English Bible – A Story of Martyrdom and Betrayal'', St Martin's Press; 1st ed. (23 August 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that most of his literary polemics appeared.

Rumours circulated during and after More's lifetime regarding ill-treatment of heretics during his time as Lord Chancellor.  The popular anti-Catholic polemicist [[John Foxe]], who "placed Protestant sufferings against the background of... the Antichrist",&lt;ref&gt;Diarmaid MacCulloch, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; was instrumental in publicising accusations of torture in his famous ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]]'', claiming that More had often personally used violence or torture while interrogating heretics. Later authors such as [[Brian Moynahan]] and [[Michael Farris (lawyer)|Michael Farris]] cite Foxe when repeating these allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Michael| last= Farris | title = From Tyndale to Madison|year=2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Ackroyd]] also lists claims from Foxe's ''Book of Martyrs'' and other post-Reformation sources that More "tied heretics to a tree in his Chelsea garden and whipped them", that "he watched as 'newe men' were put upon the rack in the Tower and tortured until they confessed", and that "he was personally responsible for the burning of several of the 'brethren' in Smithfield."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8J9uNOydymUC&amp;pg=PT510&amp;dq=Ackroyd+Thomas+More+personally+responsible+for+the+burning+of+%27brethren%27+at+Smithfield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF0MCTxKLVAhWC64MKHSMRB4wQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ackroyd%20Thomas%20More%20personally%20responsible%20for%20the%20burning%20of%20'brethren'%20at%20Smithfield&amp;f=false |title=The Life of Thomas More |author=Peter Ackroyd |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2012 |isbn=0307823016}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Marius]] records a similar claim, which tells about James Bainham, and writes that "the story Foxe told of Bainham's whipping and racking at More's hands is universally doubted today".&lt;ref name="Marius406"/&gt; More himself denied these allegations:

{{quote|Stories of a similar nature were current even in More's lifetime and he denied them forcefully. He admitted that he did imprison heretics in his house – 'theyr sure kepynge' – he called it – but he utterly rejected claims of torture and whipping... 'as help me God.'&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp |298–299}}}}

More, however, writes in his "Apology" (1533) that he only applied corporal punishment to two heretics: a child who was caned in front of his family for heresy regarding the Eucharist, and a "feeble-minded" man who was whipped for disrupting prayers.&lt;ref name="Marius"&gt;Marius, Richard (1999).

Modern commentators are divided over More's religious actions as Chancellor. Some biographers, including Ackroyd, have taken a relatively tolerant view of More's campaign against Protestantism by placing his actions within the turbulent religious climate of the time and the threat of deadly catastrophes such as the [[German Peasants' War| German Peasants Revolt]] which More blamed on Luther,&lt;ref name=Wegemer1996a&gt;{{cite book | last =Wegemer | first = Gerard|authorlink=Gerard Wegemer |title= Thomas More on statesmanship | publisher = [[Catholic University of America Press ]]|year = 1996 | url =https://books.google.ie/books?id=RazaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22thomas+more%22+german+peasants+Revolt&amp;dq=%22thomas+more%22+german+peasants+Revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2n43VxdrdAhVGJsAKHQp6DoEQ6AEIVTAI| isbn = |page = 173| quote = ...civil chaos will surely follow (691-93).

Already, in these early days of English heresy, he was thinking of the fire.

This was no longer a time for questioning, or innovation, or uncertainty, of any kind. He blamed Luther for the Peasants’ Revolt in Germany, and maintained that all its havoc and destruction were the direct result of Luther’s challenge to the authority of the Church; under the pretext of ‘libertas’ Luther preached ‘licentia’ which had in turn led to rape, sacrilege, bloodshed, fire and ruin.}} (Online citation [https://1000vampirenovels.com/pdf-novels/the-life-of-thomas-more-by-peter-ackroyd-free/47-page here])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JoannePaul2016a &gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=KN2qDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT140&amp;dq=%22thomas+more%22+german+peasants+Revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2n43VxdrdAhVGJsAKHQp6DoEQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22thomas%20more%22%20german%20peasants%20Revolt&amp;f=false |title=Thomas More |author=Joanne Paul|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2016 |isbn=9780745692203|quote=Princes were 'driven by necessity' by the 'importune malice of heretics raising rebellions' to set 'sorer and sorer punishments thereunto' (CTA, 956).

Some Protestants take a different view. In 1980, More was added to the Church of England's [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church]], despite being a fierce opponent of the [[English Reformation]] that created the Church of England. He was added jointly with [[John Fisher]], to be commemorated every 6 July (the date of More's execution) as "Thomas More, Scholar, and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, Reformation Martyrs, 1535".&lt;ref name=CofEholyDays /&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] honoured him by making him [[patron saint]] of statesmen and politicians in October 2000, stating: "It can be said that he demonstrated in a singular way the value of a moral conscience... even if, in his actions against heretics, he reflected the limits of the culture of his time".&lt;ref name=JP2PatronSaint /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Diy8DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 |title=Executing The Tudors |author=Scott Shaw-Smith |publisher=Lulu.com |year=2016 |isbn=1326872265 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resignation ===
As the conflict over supremacy between the Papacy and the King reached its apogee, More continued to remain steadfast in supporting the supremacy of the Pope as Successor of Peter over that of the King of England. Parliament's reinstatement of the charge of [[praemunire]] in 1529 had made it a crime to support in public or office the claim of any authority outside the realm (such as the Papacy) to have a legal jurisdiction superior to the King's.&lt;ref name="Kelly_xiv"/&gt;

In 1530, More refused to sign a letter by the leading English churchmen and aristocrats asking [[Pope Clement VII]] to annul Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, and also quarrelled with Henry VIII over the heresy laws. In 1531, a royal decree required the clergy to take an [[English post-Reformation oaths|oath acknowledging the King as "Supreme Head"]] of the Church in England. The bishops at the [[Convocation of Canterbury]] in 1532 agreed to sign the Oath but only under threat of [[praemunire]] and only after these words were added: "as far as Christ law allows". This was considered to be the final [[Submission of the Clergy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7biywRf8_DsC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=thomas+more+as+far+as+laws+allow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDuqemhaLVAhWF4IMKHTJ1D5YQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20more%20as%20far%20as%20laws%20allow&amp;f=false |title=Thomas More: A Portrait of Courage |author=Gerard Wegemer |publisher=Scepter Publishers |year=1995 |isbn=188933412X |page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[John Fisher]] and some other clergy refused to sign. Henry purged most clergy who supported the papal stance from senior positions in the church. More continued to refuse to sign the Oath of Supremacy and did not agree to support the annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine.&lt;ref name="Kelly_xiv"/&gt; However, he did not openly reject the King's actions and kept his opinions private.&lt;ref name="Richards8"/&gt;

On 16 May 1532, More resigned from his role as Chancellor but remained in Henry's favour in spite of his refusal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=31uoDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23&amp;dq=thomas+more+supremacy+as+far+as+the+law+of+Christ+allows&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjan-bs_aHVAhXqyoMKHUbLBccQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20more%20supremacy%20as%20far%20as%20the%20law%20of%20Christ%20allows&amp;f=false |title=Defending Royal Supremacy and Discerning God's Will in Tudor England |author=Daniel Eppley |publisher=Routledge |year=2016 |isbn=1351945793 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to resign was caused by the decision of the convocation of the English Church, which was under intense royal threat, on the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5rDAyEoHyAC&amp;pg=PA116 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Thomas More |editor=George M.

== Indictment, trial and execution ==
In 1533, More refused to attend the [[coronation]] of [[Anne Boleyn]] as the [[Queen consort|Queen of England]]. Technically, this was not an act of treason, as More had written to Henry seemingly acknowledging Anne's queenship and expressing his desire for the King's happiness and the new Queen's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Eric Ives| first = Eric W | last = Ives | title = The Life and Death of [[Anne Boleyn]] | year = 2004 | page = 47 | quote = [More wrote on the subject of the Boleyn marriage that] [I] neither murmur at it nor dispute upon it, nor never did nor will.  ...I faithfully pray to God for his Grace and hers both long to live and well, and their noble issue too...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, his refusal to attend was widely interpreted as a snub against Anne, and Henry took action against him.

Shortly thereafter, More was charged with accepting bribes, but the charges had to be dismissed for lack of any evidence. In early 1534, More was accused by [[Thomas Cromwell]] of having given advice and counsel to the "Holy Maid of Kent," [[Elizabeth Barton]], a nun who had prophesied that the king had ruined his soul and would come to a quick end for having divorced Queen Catherine. This was a month after Barton had confessed, which was possibly done under royal pressure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Religious Orders in England |volume=3 |author=[[David Knowles (scholar)|David Knowles]] |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1979 |isbn=0521295688 |pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women and Religion in England: 1500-1720 |author=Patricia Crawford |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=1136097562 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was said to be concealment of treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8J9uNOydymUC&amp;pg=PT594&amp;dq=thomas+more+elizabeth+Barton&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG2u606aLVAhUE5oMKHe2QA78Q6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20more%20elizabeth%20Barton&amp;f=false |title=The Life of Thomas More |author=Peter Ackroyd |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2012 |isbn=0307823016 |page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it was dangerous for anyone to have anything to do with Barton, More had indeed met with her, and was impressed by her fervour. But More was prudent and told her not to interfere with state matters. More was called before a committee of the Privy Counsel to answer these charges of treason, and after his respectful answers the matter seemed to be dropped.&lt;ref name="Lee1904"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Sidney|title=Great Englishmen of the Sixteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMMNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA48|year=1904|publisher=Archibald Constable, Limited|location=London|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 1534, More was asked to appear before a commission and swear his allegiance to the parliamentary [[First Succession Act|Act of Succession]]. More accepted Parliament's right to declare [[Anne Boleyn]] the legitimate Queen of England, though he refused "the spiritual validity of the king's second marriage",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5rDAyEoHyAC&amp;pg=PA116 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Thomas More |editor=George M. Logan |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=1139828487 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, holding fast to the teaching of [[papal supremacy]], he steadfastly refused to take the oath of supremacy of the Crown in the relationship between the kingdom and the church in England.  More furthermore publicly refused to uphold Henry's annulment from Catherine. [[John Fisher]], Bishop of Rochester, refused the oath along with More. The oath reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elton|first= Geoffrey Rudolph |title=The Tudor constitution: documents and commentary|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1982|isbn=0-521-24506-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJZZzoBJOfwC&amp;pg=PA7 | accessdate =24 July 2009|location=Cambridge, Cambridgeshire|oclc=7876927|page=7|edition= 2nd | chapter =The Crown| chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=CJZZzoBJOfwC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to refusing to support the King's annulment or supremacy, More refused to sign the 1534 [[Act Respecting the Oath to the Succession|Oath of Succession]] confirming Anne's role as queen and the rights of their children to succession. More's fate was sealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQtmzR9TXncC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=thomas+more+resigned&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz26zDgKLVAhVr7oMKHeBoAWsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20more%20resigned&amp;f=false |title=A Thomas More Source Book |editor1=[[Gerard Wegemer]] |editor2=Stephen W.

His enemies had enough evidence to have the King arrest him on treason. Four days later, Henry had More imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. There More prepared a devotional ''[[A Dialogue of Comfort against Tribulation|Dialogue of Comfort against Tribulation]]''. While More was imprisoned in the Tower, Thomas Cromwell made several visits, urging More to take the oath, which he continued to refuse.

The charges of [[high treason]] related to More's violating the statutes as to the King's supremacy (malicious silence) and conspiring with Bishop [[John Fisher]] in this respect (malicious conspiracy) and, according to some sources, for asserting that Parliament did not have the right to proclaim the King's Supremacy over the English Church.

Regardless of the specific charges, the indictment related to violation of the [[Treasons Act 1534]] which declared it treason to speak against the King's Supremacy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXkkCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=thomas+more++executed+++Lieutenant+see+me+safe+william+roper&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ9Yu1maLVAhXB7oMKHRQhD6IQ6AEISjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20more%20%20executed%20%20%20Lieutenant%20see%20me%20safe%20william%20roper&amp;f=false |title=Voices of the Reformation: Contemporary Accounts of Daily Life |author=John A.

Thomas Cromwell, at the time the most powerful of the King's advisors, brought forth Solicitor General [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]] to testify that More had, in his presence, denied that the King was the legitimate head of the Church. This testimony was characterised by More as being extremely dubious. Witnesses [[Richard Southwell (courtier)|Richard Southwell]] and Mr. Palmer both denied having heard the details of the reported conversation, and as More himself pointed out:

The jury took only fifteen minutes, however, to find More guilty.

After the jury's verdict was delivered and before his sentencing, More spoke freely of his belief that "no temporal man may be the head of the spirituality" (take over the role of the Pope). According to [[William Roper]]'s account, More was pleading that the Statute of Supremacy was contrary to the [[Magna Carta]], to Church laws and to the laws of England, attempting to void the entire indictment against him.&lt;ref name="Kelly_xiv"/&gt;
He was sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn, and quartered]] (the usual punishment for traitors who were not the nobility), but the King commuted this to execution by decapitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMkkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=thomas+more+sentenced+hanged,+drawn+and+quartered&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWt_m5lqLVAhVM3IMKHaSRCUQQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20more%20sentenced%20hanged%2C%20drawn%20and%20quartered&amp;f=false |title=The Household of Sir Thomas More |author1=Anne Manning |author2=Edmund Lodge |publisher=C.

== Scholarly and literary work ==

=== ''History of King Richard III'' ===
Between 1512 and 1519 More worked on a ''History of [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]]'', which he never finished but which was published after his death. The ''History'' is a Renaissance biography, remarkable more for its literary skill and adherence to classical precepts than for its historical accuracy. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Some consider it an attack on royal tyranny, rather than on Richard III himself or the [[House of York]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} More uses a more dramatic writing style than had been typical in medieval chronicles; Richard III is limned as an outstanding, archetypal tyrant - however, More was only seven years old when Richard III was killed at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] in 1485 so he had no first-hand in-depth knowledge of him.

The ''History of King Richard III'' was written and published in both English and Latin, each written separately, and with information deleted from the Latin edition to suit a European readership. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} It greatly influenced [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. Contemporary historians attribute the unflattering portraits of Richard III in both works to both authors' allegiance to the reigning [[Tudor dynasty]] that wrested the throne from Richard III in the [[Wars of the Roses]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} More's version barely mentions [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]], the first Tudor king, perhaps because he had persecuted his father, [[John More (judge)|Sir John More]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}} [[Clements Markham]] suggests that the actual author of the work was [[John Morton (cardinal)|Archbishop Morton]] and that More was simply copying or perhaps translating the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Clements|last= Markham|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36451 |title=Richard III: His Life and Character|year=1906|page=168|ref=harv| authorlink=Clements Markham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yoran, H.

Accessed December 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Utopia'' ===
{{Main|Utopia (book)}}

More's best known and most controversial work, ''Utopia'' is a [[frame narrative]] written in Latin.{{cn|date=October 2018}} More completed and theologian [[Erasmus]] published the book in [[Leuven]] in 1516, but it was only translated into English and published in his native land in 1551 (16 years after his execution), and the 1684 translation became the most commonly cited. More (also a character in the book) and the narrator/traveller, Raphael Hythlodaeus (whose name alludes both to the healer archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and 'speaker of nonsense', the surname's Greek meaning), discuss modern ills in [[Antwerp]], as well as describe the political arrangements of the imaginary island country of Utopia (a Greek pun on 'ou-topos' [no place] and 'eu-topos' [good place]) among themselves as well as to [[Pieter Gillis]] and [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]]. Utopia's original edition included a symmetrical "[[Utopian language#Writing system|Utopian alphabet]]" omitted by later editions, but which may have been an early attempt or precursor of [[shorthand]].

Utopia contrasts the contentious social life of European states with the perfectly orderly, reasonable social arrangements of Utopia and its environs (Tallstoria, Nolandia, and Aircastle). In Utopia, there are no lawyers because of the laws' simplicity and because social gatherings are in public view (encouraging participants to behave well), communal ownership supplants private property, men and women are educated alike, and there is almost complete religious toleration (except for atheists, who are allowed but despised). More may have used [[Monasticism|monastic communalism]] as his model, although other concepts such as legalising [[euthanasia]] remain far outside Church doctrine. Hythlodaeus asserts that a man who refuses to believe in a god or an afterlife could never be trusted, because he would not acknowledge any authority or principle outside himself. Some take the novel's principal message to be the social need for order and discipline rather than liberty. Ironically, Hythlodaeus, who believes philosophers should not get involved in politics, addresses More's ultimate conflict between his humanistic beliefs and courtly duties as the King's servant, pointing out that one day those morals will come into conflict with the political reality.

''Utopia'' gave rise to a literary genre, [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]], which features ideal societies or perfect cities, or their opposite. Early works influenced by ''Utopia'' included [[New Atlantis]] by [[Francis Bacon]], [[Erewhon]] by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], and [[Candide]] by [[Voltaire]]. Although [[Utopianism]] combined classical concepts of perfect societies ([[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]) with Roman rhetorical finesse (cf. [[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]], [[epideictic]] oratory), the Renaissance genre continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and survives in modern [[science fiction]].

=== Religious polemics ===
In 1520 the reformer [[Martin Luther]] published three works in quick succession: ''An Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation'' (Aug.), ''Concerning the Babylonish Captivity of the Church'' (Oct.), and ''On the Liberty of a Christian Man'' (Nov.).&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|225}} In these books, Luther set out his doctrine of salvation through grace alone, rejected certain Catholic practices, and attacked abuses and excesses within the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|225–6}} In 1521, Henry VIII formally responded to Luther's criticisms with the ''Assertio,'' written with More's assistance. [[Pope Leo X]] rewarded the English king with the title 'Fidei defensor' ("Defender of the Faith") for his work combating Luther's heresies.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|226–7}}

Martin Luther then attacked Henry VIII in print, calling him a "pig, dolt, and liar".&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|227}} At the king's request, More composed a rebuttal: the ''[[Responsio ad Lutherum]]'' was published at the end of 1523. In the ''Responsio,'' More defended papal supremacy, the sacraments, and other Church traditions. More, though considered "a much steadier personality",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zENJHwQqSy0C |title=The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History |author=[[John Vidmar]] |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2005 |isbn=0809142341 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; described Luther as an "ape", a "drunkard", and a "lousy little friar" amongst other epithets.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|230}} Writing under the pseudonym of Gulielmus Rosseus,&lt;ref name=rebhorn /&gt; More tells Luther that:

:for as long as your reverend paternity will be determined to tell these shameless lies, others will be permitted, on behalf of his English majesty, to throw back into your paternity's shitty mouth, truly the shit-pool of all shit, all the muck and shit which your damnable rottenness has vomited up, and to empty out all the sewers and privies onto your crown divested of the dignity of the priestly crown, against which no less than the kingly crown you have determined to play the buffoon.&lt;ref name="Dundes"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFvY2jWqBlQC |author1=[[Alan Dundes]] |author2=Carl R. Pagter |title=Work Hard and You Shall be Rewarded: Urban Folklore from the Paperwork Empire |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=1978 |isbn=0814324320 |pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His saying is followed with a kind of apology to his readers, while Luther possibly never apologized for his sayings.&lt;ref name="Dundes"/&gt; [[Stephen Greenblatt]] argues, "More speaks for his ruler and in his opponent's idiom; Luther speaks for himself, and his scatological imagery far exceeds in quantity, intensity, and inventiveness anything that More could muster. If for More scatology normally expresses a communal disapproval, for Luther, it expresses a deep personal rage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=11msvVh_3nMC |title=Learning to Curse: Essays in Early Modern Culture |author=[[Stephen Greenblatt]] |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |isbn=1136774203 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confronting Luther confirmed More's theological conservatism. He thereafter avoided any hint of criticism of Church authority.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|230}} In 1528, More published another religious polemic, ''A Dialogue Concerning Heresies'', that asserted the Catholic Church was the one true church, established by Christ and the Apostles, and affirmed the validity of its authority, traditions and practices.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|279–81}} In 1529, the circulation of [[Simon Fish]]'s ''Supplication for the Beggars'' prompted More to respond with ''The Supplication of Souls''.

In 1531, a year after More's father died, [[William Tyndale]] published ''An Answer unto Sir Thomas More's Dialogue'' in response to More's ''Dialogue Concerning Heresies.'' More responded with a half million words: the ''Confutation of Tyndale's Answer''. The ''Confutation'' is an imaginary dialogue between More and Tyndale, with More addressing each of Tyndale's criticisms of Catholic rites and doctrines.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|307–9}} More, who valued structure, tradition and order in society as safeguards against tyranny and error, vehemently believed that Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation in general were dangerous, not only to the Catholic faith but to the stability of society as a whole.&lt;ref name="Ackroyd" /&gt;{{rp|307–9}}

=== Correspondence ===
Most major humanists were prolific letter writers, and Thomas More was no exception. As in the case of his friend Erasmus of Rotterdam, however, only a small portion of his correspondence (about 280 letters) survived. These include everything from personal letters to official government correspondence (mostly in English), letters to fellow humanist scholars (in Latin), several epistolary tracts, verse epistles, prefatory letters (some fictional) to several of More's own works, letters to More's children and their tutors (in Latin), and the so-called "prison-letters" (in English) which he exchanged with his oldest daughter Margaret while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London awaiting execution.&lt;ref name="Gerard" /&gt; More also engaged in controversies, most notably with the French poet [[Germain de Brie]], which culminated in the publication of de Brie's ''Antimorus'' (1519). Erasmus intervened, however, and ended the dispute.&lt;ref name="MoynahanBrian" /&gt;

More also wrote about more spiritual matters. They include: ''A Treatise on the Passion'' (a.k.a. Treatise on the Passion of Christ), ''A Treatise to Receive the Blessed Body'' (a.k.a. Holy Body Treaty), and ''De Tristitia Christi'' (a.k.a. The Agony of Christ). More handwrote the last which reads in the Tower of London while awaiting his execution. This last manuscript, saved from the confiscation decreed by Henry VIII, passed by the will of his daughter Margaret to Spanish hands through Fray Pedro de Soto, confessor of Emperor Charles V. More's friend [[Luis Vives]] received it in Valencia, where it remains in the collection of [[Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi]] museum.

=== Roman Catholic Church ===
[[Pope Leo XIII]] [[beatification|beatified]] Thomas More, [[John Fisher]] and [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation#Beatified 29 December 1886 by Pope Leo XIII|52 other English Martyrs]] on 29 December 1886. Pope Pius XI [[canonisation|canonised]] More and Fisher on 19 May 1935, and More's feast day was established as 9 July. Since 1970 the [[General Roman Calendar]] has celebrated More with St John Fisher on 22 June (the date of Fisher's execution). On 31 October 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] declared More "the heavenly [[patron saint|Patron]] of Statesmen and Politicians".&lt;ref name=JP2PatronSaint&gt;[[Apostolic letter]] issued ''[[motu proprio]]'' proclaiming Saint Thomas More Patron of Statesmen and Politicians, 31 October 2000 [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_20001031_thomas-more_en.html Vatican.va]&lt;/ref&gt; More is the patron of the German Catholic youth organisation [[Katholische Junge Gemeinde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kjg.de/?id=12|title=Thomas Morus|website=www.kjg.de|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anglican Communion ===
In 1980, despite their opposing the [[English Reformation]], More and Fisher were jointly added as martyrs of the reformation to the [[Church of England]]'s calendar of "Saints and Heroes of the Christian Church", to be commemorated every 6 July (the date of More's execution) as "Thomas More, Scholar, and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, Reformation Martyrs, 1535".&lt;ref name=CofEholyDays /&gt;

More is also listed in the [[List of Anglican Church calendars#Calendars of saints' days in churches throughout the Anglican communion|calendars of saints of some of the other churches]] in the [[Anglican Communion]] including:
* [[Calendar of saints (Anglican Church of Australia)#July|The Anglican Church of Australia]] has "July 6: John Fisher and Thomas More, martyrs (died 1535)".

The steadfastness and courage with which More maintained his religious convictions, and his dignity during his imprisonment, trial, and execution, contributed much to More's posthumous reputation, particularly among Roman Catholics. His friend [[Erasmus]] defended More's character as "more pure than any snow" and described his genius as "such as England never had and never again will have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel J.

While Roman Catholic scholars maintain that More used irony in ''Utopia,'' and that he remained an orthodox Christian, Marxist theoretician [[Karl Kautsky]] considered the book a shrewd critique of economic and social exploitation in pre-modern Europe; More thus is claimed to have influenced the development of socialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Thomas More and his Utopia'' (1888)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], the Russian [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning anti-Communist author, survivor and [[The Gulag Archipelago|historian of the Soviet Gulag system]], argued that Soviet communism needed enslavement and forced labour to survive, and that this had been " ...foreseen as far back as Thomas More, in his ''Utopia''".&lt;ref name=Bloom01a&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s-sVN2COG78C&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22Solzhenitsyn+insists+that+the+Soviet+system+cannot+survive+without+the+camps%22+%22Thomas+More%22+%22the+great-grandfather+of+socialism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Solzhenitsyn%20insists%20that%20the%20Soviet%20system%20cannot%20survive%20without%20the%20camps%22%20%22Thomas%20More%22%20%22the%20great-grandfather%20of%20socialism%22&amp;f=false|title=Enslavement and Emancipation|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|author1=Bloom, Harold|authorlink1=Harold Bloom|author2=Hobby, Blake|pages=173–174| date=2010|isbn=978-1-60413-441-4|accessdate=20 January 2015|quote=Moreover, Solzhenitsyn insists that the Soviet system cannot survive without the camps, that Soviet communism requires enslavement and forced labour.

== Literature and popular culture ==
[[William Roper (biographer)|William Roper]]'s biography of More was one of the first biographies in Modern English.

''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]'' is a play written circa 1592 in collaboration with [[Henry Chettle]], [[Anthony Munday]], [[William Shakespeare]], and others. In it More is portrayed as a wise and honest statesman. The original manuscript has survived as a handwritten text that shows many revisions by its several authors, as well as the censorious influence of Edmund Tylney, [[Master of the Revels]] in the government of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. The script has since been published and has had several productions.&lt;ref name="Long, William B. 1989 pages 49"&gt;Long, William B. ''The Occasion of the Book of Sir Thomas More''. Howard-Hill, T.H. editor. ''Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; essays on the play and its Shakespearean Interest''. Cambridge University Press. (1989) {{ISBN|0 521 34658 4}}. pages 49–54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Long, William B. 1989 pages 49"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabrieli, Vittorio. Melchiori, Giorgio, editors ''Introduction''. Munday, Anthony. And others. ''Sir Thomas More''. Manchester University Press. {{ISBN|0-7190-1544-8}}. Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th-century agnostic playwright [[Robert Bolt]] portrayed Thomas More as the [[tragic hero]] of his 1960 play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]''. The title is drawn from what [[Robert Whittington]] in 1520 wrote of More:

&lt;blockquote&gt;More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.&lt;ref name=oconnell /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1966, the play, ''A Man for All Seasons'', was adapted into a [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|film]] with the same title. It was directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]] and adapted for the screen by the playwright. It stars [[Paul Scofield]], a noted British actor, who said that the part of Sir Thomas More was "the most difficult part I played."&lt;ref&gt;Gary O'Connor (2002), ''Paul Scofield: An Actor for All Seasons'', Applause Books. Page 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and Scofield won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]]. In 1988 [[Charlton Heston]] starred in and directed a made-for-television film that restored the character of "the common man" that had been cut from the 1966 film.

Catholic science fiction writer [[R. A. Lafferty]] wrote his novel ''[[Past Master (novel)|Past Master]]'' as a modern equivalent to More's ''Utopia'', which he saw as a satire. In this novel, Thomas More travels through time to the year 2535, where he is made king of the world "Astrobe", only to be beheaded after ruling for a mere nine days. One character compares More favourably to almost every other major historical figure: "He had one completely honest moment right at the end. I cannot think of anyone else who ever had one."

[[Karl Zuchardt]]'s novel, ''[[Stirb du Narr!]]'' ("Die you fool!"), about More's struggle with [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry]], portrays More as an idealist bound to fail in the power struggle with a ruthless ruler and an unjust world.

The novelist [[Hilary Mantel]] portrays More as an unsympathetic persecutor of Protestants, and an ally of the Habsburg empire, in her 2009 novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', told from the perspective of a sympathetically portrayed [[Thomas Cromwell]].

Literary critic James Wood in his book ''The Broken Estate'', a collection of essays, is critical of More and refers to him as "cruel in punishment, evasive in argument, lusty for power, and repressive in politics".&lt;ref name="Wood2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=James|title=The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiI8Kwd6j9AC&amp;pg=PA15|year=2010|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-42956-0|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aaron Zelman]]'s non-fiction book ''The State Versus the People'' includes a comparison of ''Utopia'' with Plato's ''Republic''. Zelman is undecided as to whether More was being ironic in his book or was genuinely advocating a [[police state]]. Zelman comments, "More is the only Christian saint to be honoured with a statue at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]]."{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} By this Zelman implies that ''Utopia'' influenced [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]], despite their brutal repression of religion.

Other biographers, such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], have offered a more sympathetic picture of More as both a sophisticated philosopher and man of letters, as well as a zealous Catholic who believed in the authority of the [[Holy See]] over [[Christendom]].

The protagonist of [[Walker Percy]]'s novels, ''[[Love in the Ruins]]'' and ''[[The Thanatos Syndrome]]'', is "Dr Thomas More", a reluctant Catholic and descendant of More.

More is the focus of the [[Al Stewart]] song "A Man For All Seasons" from the 1978 album ''[[Time Passages]]'', and of the [[Far (band)|Far]] song "Sir", featured on the limited editions and 2008 re-release of their 1994 album ''[[Quick (album)|Quick]]''. In addition, the song "[[So Says I]]" by indie rock outfit [[The Shins]] alludes to the socialist interpretation of More's ''Utopia''.

[[Jeremy Northam]] depicts More in the television series ''[[The Tudors]] ''as a peaceful man, as well as a devout Roman Catholic and loving family patriarch. He also shows More loathing Protestantism, burning both Martin Luther's books and English Protestants who have been convicted of heresy. The portrayal has unhistorical aspects, such as that More neither personally caused nor attended [[Simon Fish]]'s execution (since Fish actually died of [[bubonic plague]] in 1531 before he could stand trial), although More's ''The Supplycatyon of Soulys'', published in October 1529, addressed Fish's [[Simon Fish#Supplycatyon of Soulys: St. Thomas More's Response to Simon Fish|''Supplication for the Beggars'']].&lt;ref name=FishOnline1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30al_tR6_e0C&amp;dq=%22simon+fish%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=OZx98r1-PW&amp;sig=YXAyizrF6WzrUL_5kpzfbg8-Xfw#PRA1-PA19,M1|title=A Supplicacyon for the Beggers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MoreVsFish1&gt;see Fish, Simon.

''Studies in English Literature, 1500–1900'', Vol. 7, No. 1, ''The English Renaissance'', Winter, 1967, 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, there is no evidence that More ever attended the execution of any heretic. The series also neglected to show More's avowed insistence that Richard Rich's testimony about More disputing the King's title as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] was perjured.

In 2002, More was placed at number 37 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].&lt;ref&gt;Sue Parrill, William Baxter Robison (2013). "The Tudors on Film and Television", p. 92. McFarland,&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--four subsections have no citations--&gt;

=== Westminster Hall ===
A plaque in the middle of the floor of London's [[Westminster Hall]] commemorates More's trial for treason and condemnation to execution in that original part of the [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref name="tms_hall"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thomasmorestudies.org/map-near-6.html | title=Westminster Hall | publisher=The Center for Thomas More Studies | date=2010 | accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, which houses Parliament, would have been well known to More, who served several terms as a member and became Speaker of the House of Commons before his appointment as England's Lord Chancellor.

=== Crosby Hall ===
The Crown confiscated More's home and estate along the Thames in Chelsea after his execution. Crosby Hall, which was part of More's London residence, was eventually relocated and reconstructed in Chelsea by conservation architect [[Walter Godfrey]] in 1910. Rebuilt in the 1990s, the white stone building stands amid modern brick structures that attempt to recapture the style of More's former manor on the site. Crosby Hall is privately owned and closed to the public. The modern structures face the Thames and include an entry way that displays More's arms, heraldic beasts, and a Latin maxim. Apartment buildings and a park cover the former gardens and orchard; Roper's Garden is the park atop one of More's gardens, sunken as his was believed to be. No other remnants exist of the More estate.

=== Chelsea Old Church ===
[[File:Chelsea Old Church 14.JPG|thumb|Thomas More statue, Chelsea Old Church]]
Across a small park and Old Church Street from Crosby Hall is [[Chelsea Old Church]], an Anglican church whose southern chapel More commissioned and in which he sang with the parish choir. Except for his chapel, the church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1958. The capitals on the medieval arch connecting the chapel to the main sanctuary display symbols associated with More and his office. On the southern wall of the sanctuary is the tomb and epitaph he erected for himself and his wives, detailing his ancestry and accomplishments in Latin, including his role as peacemaker between the Christian nations of Europe as well as a curiously altered portion about his curbing heresy. When More served Mass, he would leave by the door just to the left of it. He is not, however, buried here, nor is it entirely certain which of his family may be. It is open to the public at specific times. Outside the church, facing the [[River Thames]], is a statue by L. Cubitt Bevis erected in 1969, commemorating More as "saint", "scholar", and "statesman"; the back displays his coat-of-arms. Nearby, on Upper Cheyne Row, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer &amp; St. Thomas More honours the martyr.

=== Tower Hill ===
A plaque and small garden commemorate the famed execution site on Tower Hill, London, just outside the Tower of London, as well as all those executed there, many as religious martyrs or as prisoners of conscience. More's corpse, minus his head, was unceremoniously buried in an unmarked mass grave beneath the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|Royal Chapel of St. Peter Ad Vincula]], within the walls of the [[Tower of London]], as was the custom for traitors executed at Tower Hill. The chapel is accessible to Tower visitors.

=== St Katharine Docks ===
Thomas More is commemorated by a stone [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] near [[St Katharine Docks]], just east of the Tower where he was executed. The street in which it is situated was formerly called Nightingale Lane, a corruption of "Knighten Guild", derived from the original owners of the land. It is now renamed Thomas More Street in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringeastlondon.co.uk/eel/Stkatharines/Stkatharines.htm#More|title=St Katharine's Dock|publisher=Exploring East London|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== St Dunstan's Church and Roper House, Canterbury ===
[[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]], an Anglican parish church in Canterbury, possesses More's head, rescued by his daughter [[Margaret Roper]], whose family lived in Canterbury down and across the street from their parish church. A stone immediately to the left of the altar marks the sealed Roper family vault beneath the Nicholas Chapel, itself to the right of the church's sanctuary or main altar. [[St. Dunstan's, Canterbury|St Dunstan's Church]] has carefully investigated, preserved and sealed this burial vault. The last archaeological investigation revealed that the suspected head of More rests in a niche separate from the other bodies, possibly from later interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulte Herbrüggen|first=Hubertus|title=Das Haupt des Thomas Morus in der St. Dunstan-Kirche zu Canterbury|series=Forschungsberichte des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen|year=1982|publisher=VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displays in the chapel record the archaeological findings in pictures and narratives. Roman Catholics donated stained glass to commemorate the events in More's life. A small plaque marks the former home of William and Margaret Roper; another house nearby and entitled Roper House is now a home for the deaf.

'''Tom Christopher Garvin''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Royal Irish Academy|MRIA]]}} (born 1944) is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[political scientist]] and [[historian]]. He is Professor Emeritus of Politics in [[University College Dublin]]. He retired from lecturing duties in August 2008. He is an alumnus of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in [[Washington, DC]].

Garvin is a graduate of UCD with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in history and politics and a [[Master of Arts]] degree in politics. His [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree was awarded by the [[University of Georgia]] in 1974 for his thesis ''Political Parties in a Dublin Constituency: A Behavioural Analysis''. [http://www.ucd.ie/ibis/Tom%20Garvin%20Conference%20Programme.pdf] He was a central figure in establishing the Political Studies Association of Ireland in 1982, and his professional reputation saw him win rapid promotion in UCD, where he became [[Professor]] of Politics in 1991. In that capacity, he also served as Head of Department until 2005. His academic career was marked by productive sabbaticals in the USA (where he spent extended periods in the Woodrow Wilson Center, Washington DC; Colgate University; Mount Holyoke College; the University of Georgia; and, as Burns Professor, [[Boston College]]). His academic distinction was marked by his election as a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 2003.

Garvin's academic output includes 60 articles in journals, chapters in books, and publications of similar type; six books, with a further two forthcoming; two edited volumes; and a range of publications of other kinds. The best-known of his books form a sequence dealing with successive themes in the emergence of modern Ireland: "''The evolution of Irish nationalist politics''" (1981, 1983); "''Nationalist revolutionaries in Ireland 1858-1928''" (1987); "''1922: the birth of Irish democracy''" (1996); and "''Preventing the future: why was Ireland so poor for so long''" (2004).

Tom Garvin retired on 1 September 2008 after working for 41 years in what is now the UCD School of Politics and International Relations.

'''Toussaint-Bernard Émeric-David''' (20 August 1755 – 2 April 1839) was a [[France|French]] [[archaeologist]] and writer on art.

==Life==
Éméric-David  was born in [[Aix-en-Provence]]. He gained a law degree at the university at Aix-en-Provence in 1775. Destined for the legal profession, and having gone in 1775 to [[Paris]] to complete his legal education, he acquired there a taste for art which influenced his whole future career. He went to [[Italy]], where he continued his art studies. He soon returned, however, to his native village, and followed for some time the profession of an advocate; but in 1787 he succeeded his uncle Antoine David as printer to the [[parlement]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was elected mayor of Aix in 1791, but as the [[French Revolution]] worsened for public officials, he moved to Paris and then briefly into hiding during the [[Reign of Terror]]. For some time to adopt a vagrant life. When danger was past he returned to Aix, sold his printing business, and engaged in general commercial pursuits; but he was not long in renouncing these also in order to devote himself exclusively to literature and art.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
Paris became his new home and he resolved to be an art historian.

From 1809 to 1814, under the [[First French Empire|Empire]], he represented his ''[[Départements of France|département]]'' in the Lower House (''Corps législatif''); in 1814 he voted for the downfall of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]; in 1815 he retired into private life, and in 1816 he was elected a member of [[Institut de France|the Institute]] ([[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]]). He died in Paris on 2 April 1839.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Works==
Éméric-David was placed in 1825 on the commission appointed to continue ''L'Histoire littraire de la France''. His principal works are ''Recherches sur l'art statuaire, considéré chez les anciens et les modernes'' (Paris, 1805), a work which obtained the prize of the Institute; ''Suite d'études calquées et dessinées d'après cinq tableaux de Raphaël'' (Paris, 1818–1821), in 6 vols.; ''Jupiter: Recherches sur ce dieu, sur son culte, et sur les monuments qui le représentent'' (Paris, 1833), 2 vols., illustrated; and ''Vulcain'' (Paris, 1837).

==Legacy==
A street in the centre of [[Aix-en-Provence]] named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wl&amp;q= Google Maps]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 [[Chester Crocker]], U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs for newly elected [[United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], had developed a [[Linkage (policy)|linkage policy]]. It tied [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid South Africa]]'s agreement to relinquish control of [[Namibia]], in line with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435]], and to retreat from Angola, to Cuba's withdrawing its troops from Angola.&lt;ref name="linkage"&gt;Tvedten, Inge. ''Angola: Struggle for Peace and Reconstruction'', 1997. Pages 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crocker"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/guides/debate/chats/crocker/ COLD WAR Chat: Chester Crocker, Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs] CNN&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 1986 Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] accepted Crocker's proposal in principle. The South African government also accepted the principle of linkage; it proposed the concept at the UN 7th Plenary Meeting on 20 September 1986 (the Question of Namibia).

The concept was strongly rejected by a Cuban-backed majority, with representatives strongly stating their opposition to the effect of, "... The UN.... Calls upon South Africa to desist from linking the independence of Namibia to irrelevant and extraneous issues such as the presence of Cuban troops in Angola as such linkage is incompatible with the relevant United Nations resolutions, particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1978);..."&lt;ref name="UN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/spec/aress14-1.htm|title=Question of Namibia|publisher=United Nations General Assembly|date=1986-09-20|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Angolan and United States governments started bilateral talks in June 1987 while the civil war continued. There is disagreement amongst historians on how the various parties agreed to come to the table:

1. Cuba contends that its military successes against the South Africans in Angola drove the South Africans to the negotiating table.  They claim their intervention in the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale|defence of Cuito Cuanavale]] stopped UNITA and South African offensives. They believe that UNITA and South Africa retreated after a 15-hour battle on 23 March, and moved for negotiations when the stakes became too high.&lt;ref name="linkage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cuitodate"&gt;Kahn, Owen Ellison. ''Disengagement from Southwest Africa: The Prospects for Peace in Angola and Namibia'', 1991. University of Miami Institute for Soviet and East. Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; While the negotiations started in June 1987, during the latter half of 1987 South African had numerous military successes. In addition, the major Cuban military surge did not take place until 1988, long after the negotiations had commenced.

2. South Africa places the events in the context of the end of the [[Cold War]], with an associated end to the threat of Communist expansion in the region.  From an economic perspective, the effect of sanctions was beginning to be felt in South Africa, while Namibia was costing South Africa over 1 billion Rand annually{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.  Also, the South African domestic political landscape was changing rapidly and the country was under considerable pressure at the [[United Nations]] to grant independence to Namibia.&lt;ref name="UN1"/&gt;  The Cubans too faced the economic pressures of the war, as the MPLA government of Angola had stopped paying Cuba for its services.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In the words of Chester Crocker, "Watching South Africa and Cuba at the table was like watching two scorpions in a bottle."{{Cite quote|date=July 2009}}

After refusing direct talks with Cuba, the US agreed to include a Cuban delegation in the negotiations, who joined on January 28, 1988. The three parties held a round of negotiations on March 9 in [[London]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The South African government joined negotiations in Cairo on 3 May expecting UN Security Resolution 435 to be modified. Defence Minister [[Magnus Malan]] and President [[Pieter Willem Botha|P.W. Botha]] asserted that South Africa would withdraw from Angola only "if Russia and its proxies did the same."{{Cite quote|date=August 2009}} They did not mention withdrawing from Namibia. On 16 March 1988, the South African ''Business Day'' reported that Pretoria was "offering to withdraw into Namibia – not from Namibia – in return for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. The implication is that South Africa has no real intention of giving up the territory any time soon." However the UN plenary meeting of 1986 indicates that the South Africans were linking Namibian independence with Cuban withdrawal.&lt;ref name="UN1"/&gt; The Cuban negotiator, Jorge Risquet, announced that Cuba would stay in Angola until the end of apartheid, probably also as a negotiation ploy. (Apartheid did not end until more than 4 years after Cuba left Angola).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The Cubans suggested that the U.S. was worried whether the Cuban forces would stop their advance at the Namibian border.&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press) quoting: "Entrevista de Risquet con Chester Crocker, 26/6/88", ACC&lt;/ref&gt; Jorge Risquet, head of the Cuban delegation, rejected the South African demands, noting that "South Africa must face the fact that it will not obtain at the negotiating table what it could not achieve on the battlefield."&lt;ref name="France 2006"&gt;''Une Odyssee Africaine'' (France, 2006, 59mn) directed by: Jihan El Tahri&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses, Piero: ''Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976'' (The University of North Carolina Press)  quoting: "Actas das Conversaçôes Quadripartidas entre a RPA, Cuba, Estados Unidos de América e a Africa do Sul realizadas no Cairo de 24-26.06.988", Archives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, Havanna&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the book ''32 Battalion'' by Piet Nortje, during this campaign South Africa introduced its new secret weapons, the [[G5 howitzer|G5]] and [[G6 howitzer]] guns. The cannons can fire a projectile over {{convert|40|km|mi}} with a high degree of accuracy.  The guns were used to halt the Cuban advance to the south and raised the specter of yet another unaffordable arms escalation between two medium-sized military powers. The South Africans assert that the new weapon raised Cuba's fear of more casualties in a war where Cuban fatalities had outnumbered South African fatalities by a factor 10.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  Conversely, the Cuban air force held [[air superiority]], as was demonstrated by the bombing of the strategic [[Calueque]] complex, and the overflights in 1988 of Cuban [[Mig-23]]'s of Namibian airspace.  According to [[David Albright]], South Africa believed that the discovery of preparations for a nuclear weapon test at the [[Vastrap]] facility created an urgency amongst the superpowers to find a solution.&lt;ref name="Albright"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=|author=David Albright|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|title=South Africa and the Affordable Bomb|date=July 1994|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7wIryQK6UkC&amp;pg=15|title=Out of (South) Africa: Pretoria's Nuclear Weapons Experience|year=1999|publisher=Dianne Publishing|isbn=1-4289-9484-X|author=Roy E. Horton, USAF Institute for National Security Studies|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negotiations reached a deadlock that was broken by the South African negotiator, Pik Botha, who convinced Jorge Riquet that, in the words of Botha "...We can both be losers and we can both be winners..."{{Cite quote|date=July 2009}} Pik Botha offered a compromise that would appear to be palatable to both sides while emphasising that the alternative would be detrimental to both sides.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

While the hostilities in Angola continued, the parties met in June and August in [[New York City]] and [[Geneva]]. Finally all approved an outline agreement of ''Principles for a Peaceful Settlement in South Western Africa'' on 20 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usip.org/library/pa/angola/angola_cuba_sa_12221988.html Agreement Among the People's Republic of Angola, the Republic of Cuba, and the Republic of South Africa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114185621/http://www.usip.org/library/pa/angola/angola_cuba_sa_12221988.html |date=2009-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the negotiations, the South Africans were asked to release imprisoned ANC activist [[Nelson Mandela]] as a sign of goodwill, which was denied.&lt;ref name="France 2006"/&gt; A ceasefire was finally agreed upon on August 8, 1988. Mandela remained in prison until 2 February 1990, when South Africa lifted the ban on activities of the ANC [[African National Congress]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;Alao, Abiodun. ''Brothers at War: Dissidence and Rebellion in Southern Africa'', 1994. Pages XIX-XXI.&lt;/ref&gt;

The negotiations were finalised in New York with Angola, Cuba and South Africa signing the accord on 22 December 1988. It provided for the retreat of South African forces from Angola, which had already taken place by 30 August; the withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia; and Namibia's independence and the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola within 30 months.

The agreement followed the American linkage proposal which had also been pushed by South African on numerous occasions in 1984 and in 1986 (the UN plenary meeting). Namibia was to gain independence on terms that South Africa had set out, including multi-party democracy, a capitalist free-market economy, and a transition period.

==Implementation==
The South African Army left Angola by 30 August 1988, before the conditions for Cuba's withdrawal had been agreed. Cuban troops began withdrawing on 10 January 1989, and the withdrawal was finalised in stages one month early on 25 May 1991.

The Angolan government offered an amnesty to [[UNITA]] troops&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; under the premise that UNITA would be integrated into the MPLA under a one-party state economy. That concept was rejected by UNITA. The situation in the country was anything but settled, and civil war continued for more than a decade.

According to ''Presidents of Foreign Policy'' by Edward R. Drachman and Alan Shank, a series of meetings and accords between UNITA and the MPLA, brokered by various African leaders, failed horribly. UNITA was insulted by MPLA's insistence on a premise of a one-party state. A combination of MPLA dismay of intervention from the USA (backing UNITA and forcing a shift in power) led to the MPLA dropping the one-party state and opening the door to a multi-party democracy, with the inclusion of UNITA as a competing party. After some 18 years of war, that was a tremendous breakthrough.

The elections were declared "generally" free and fair by the UN, with the MPLA gaining just under 50% of the vote. However UNITA, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said that the election had been neither free nor fair.&lt;ref name=Multiple1992&gt;National Society for Human Rights, ''Ending the Angolan Conflict'', Windhoek, Namibia, 3 July 2000 (opposition parties, massacres); John Matthew, Letters, ''The Times'', UK, 6 November 1992 (election observer); NSHR, Press Releases, 12 September 2000, 16 May 2001 (MPLA atrocities).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Halloween Massacre (Angola)|Halloween Massacre]], UNITA leader [[Jonas Savimbi]] directed UNITA forces to take up arms again against the MPLA. However, the US now opposed UNITA, instead pressuring Savimbi to accept the election results. The war ended aftee Savimbi's death, in 2002.

In preparation for independence, free elections in Namibia were held in November 1989, with SWAPO taking 57% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian,'' 26 July 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:E11DE9-213:|title=Congress.gov {{!}} Library of Congress|website=thomas.loc.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namibia gained independence in March 1990. SWAPO was originally a Marxist party that intended to install a one-party state. The South African government rejected that premise until the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] and SWAPO assured that it would support a multi-party democracy with a capitalist, [[free market economy]].

South Africa held onto Namibia's economic port of [[Walvis Bay]] for an additional 18 months until it was assured that SWAPO would respect the newly-founded constitution and the principle of a multi-party democracy.

As part of the Tripartite Accord, the African National Congress, the Marxist-leaning [[guerrilla]]/freedom movement conducting guerrilla attacks in South Africa to end [[apartheid]], would remove its bases from Angola and no longer received support from the Angolan MPLA. The ANC moved its operations to Zambia and Uganda. Later, the ANC also dropped its Marxist philosophy and was accepted into the wider [[South African Democratic Movement]], which supported political change in the country.

After the government repealed a ban on ANC activities, it eventually won democratic elections in South Africa, became the ruling party of a multi-party, democratic South Africa, and supports a free market economy.

'''Tristan Tzara''' ({{IPA-fr|tʁistɑ̃ dzaʁa|lang}}; {{IPA-ro|trisˈtan ˈt͡sara|lang}}; born '''Samuel''' or '''Samy Rosenstock''', also known as '''S. Samyro'''; {{OldStyleDate|16 April|1896|4 April}} &amp;ndash; 25 December 1963) was a Romanian and French [[avant-garde]] poet, essayist and [[performance art]]ist. Also active as a journalist, playwright, literary and art critic, composer and film director, he was known best for being one of the founders and central figures of the [[anti-establishment]] [[Dada]] movement. Under the influence of [[Adrian Maniu]], the adolescent Tzara became interested in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and co-founded the magazine ''[[Simbolul]]'' with [[Ion Vinea]] (with whom he also wrote [[Experimental literature|experimental]] poetry) and painter [[Marcel Janco]]. During [[World War I]], after briefly collaborating on Vinea's ''[[Chemarea]]'', he joined Janco in Switzerland. There, Tzara's shows at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]], as well as his poetry and [[art manifesto]]s, became a main feature of early Dadaism. His work represented Dada's [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] side, in contrast with the more moderate approach favored by [[Hugo Ball]].

After moving to Paris in 1919, Tzara, by then one of the "presidents of Dada", joined the staff of ''[[Littérature]]'' magazine, which marked the first step in the movement's evolution toward [[Surrealism]]. He was involved in the major polemics which led to Dada's split, defending his principles against [[André Breton]] and [[Francis Picabia]], and, in Romania, against the [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] [[modernism]] of Vinea and Janco. This personal vision on art defined his Dadaist plays ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' (1921) and ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'' (1924). A forerunner of [[Surrealist automatism|automatist techniques]], Tzara eventually aligned himself with Breton's Surrealism, and under its influence wrote his celebrated [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian poem]] ''[[The Approximate Man]]''.

During the final part of his career, Tzara combined his [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] perspective with a [[Communism|communist]] vision, joining the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], and serving a term in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. Having spoken in favor of [[liberalization]] in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] just before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]], he distanced himself from the [[French Communist Party]], of which he was by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the [[Algerian War]].

Tristan Tzara was an influential author and performer, whose contribution is credited with having created a connection from [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] to the [[Beat Generation]], [[Situationist International|Situationism]] and various currents in [[rock music]]. The friend and collaborator of many modernist figures, he was the lover of dancer [[Maja Kruscek]] in his early youth and was later married to Swedish artist and poet [[Greta Knutson]].

==Name==
''S. Samyro'', a partial [[anagram]] of ''Samy Rosenstock'', was used by Tzara from his debut and throughout the early 1910s.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.108-109"&gt;Cernat, p.108-109&lt;/ref&gt; A number of undated writings, which he probably authored as early as 1913, bear the signature ''Tristan Ruia'', and, in summer of 1915, he was signing his pieces with the name ''Tristan''.&lt;ref name="pcern109"&gt;Cernat, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"&gt;{{fr icon}} Jacques-Yves Conrad, [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm ''Promenade surréaliste sur la colline de Montmartre''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915053946/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/Association/Conrad.htm |date=15 September 2008 }}, at the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle]] [http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ Center for the Study of Surrealism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327041319/http://melusine.univ-paris3.fr/ |date=27 March 2008 }}; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Rosenstock's collaborator and later rival Ion Vinea claimed that he was responsible for coining the ''Tzara'' part of his pseudonym in 1915.&lt;ref name="pcern109"/&gt; Vinea also stated that Tzara wanted to keep ''Tristan'' as his adopted first name, and that this choice had later attracted him the "infamous pun" ''Triste Âne Tzara'' ([[French language|French]] for "Sad Donkey Tzara").&lt;ref name="pcern109"/&gt; This version of events is uncertain, as manuscripts show that the writer may have already been using the full name, as well as the variations ''Tristan Țara'' and ''Tr. Tzara'', in 1913-1914 (although there is a possibility that he was signing his texts long after committing them to paper).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, art historian [[Serge Fauchereau]], based on information received from Colomba, the wife of avant-garde poet [[Ilarie Voronca]], recounted that Tzara himself had explained his chosen name was a pun in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], ''trist în țară'', meaning "sad in the country"; Colomba Voronca was also dismissing rumors that Tzara had selected ''Tristan'' as a tribute to poet [[Tristan Corbière]] or to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' opera.&lt;ref name="pcern110"&gt;Cernat, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; Samy Rosenstock legally adopted his new name in 1925, after filing a request with Romania's [[Minister of Interior and Administrative Reform (Romania)|Ministry of the Interior]].&lt;ref name="pcern110"/&gt; The French pronunciation of his name has become commonplace in Romania, where it replaces its more natural reading as ''țara'' ("the land", {{IPA-ro|ˈt͡sara}}).&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Andra Matzal, [http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/node/2948 "România-fantomă o să mai existe în forma unei suferințe psihice" (interview with Andrei Codrescu)]{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, at [http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/ Club Literatura]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613075708/http://clubliteratura.cotidianul.ro/ |date=13 June 2009 }}, ''[[Cotidianul]]''; retrieved 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and ''Simbolul'' years===
Tzara was born in [[Moinești]], [[Bacău County]], in the [[Historical regions of Romania|historical region]] of [[Western Moldavia]]. His parents were [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanians]] who reportedly spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as their first language;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; his father Filip and grandfather Ilie were entrepreneurs in the forestry business.&lt;ref name="iliv241"&gt;Livezeanu, p.241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vmttcl"&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Macarie, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MACARIEnov4.html "Inedit: Tristan Tzara"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309001230/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MACARIEnov4.html |date=9 March 2009 }}, in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's mother was Emilia Rosenstock, ''née'' Zibalis.&lt;ref name="vmttcl"/&gt; Owing to the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]'s discrimination laws, the Rosenstocks were not [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipated]], and thus Tzara was not a full citizen of the country until after 1918.&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;

He moved to [[Bucharest]] at the age of 11, and attended the Schemitz-Tierin [[boarding school]].&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt; It is believed that the young Tzara completed his secondary education at a state-run high school, which is identified as the [[Saint Sava National College]]&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt; or as the Sfântul Gheorghe High School.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.48-51&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1912, when Tzara was aged 16, he joined his friends Vinea and Marcel Janco in editing ''[[Simbolul]]''. Reputedly, Janco and Vinea provided the funds.&lt;ref name="pcern99"&gt;Cernat, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Like Vinea, Tzara was also close to their young colleague [[Jacques G. Costin]], who was later his self-declared promoter and admirer.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.186-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their young age, the three editors were able to attract collaborations from established [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] authors, active within [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's own Symbolist movement]]. Alongside their close friend and mentor [[Adrian Maniu]] (an [[Imagism|Imagist]] who had been Vinea's tutor),&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; they included [[N. Davidescu]], [[Alfred Hefter|Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]], [[Emil Isac]], [[Claudia Millian]], [[Ion Minulescu]], [[I. M. Rașcu]], [[Eugeniu Sperantia]], [[Al. T. Stamatiad]], [[Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est]], [[Constantin T. Stoika]], as well as the journalist and lawyer [[Poldi Chapier]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"&gt;Cernat, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; In its inaugural issue, the journal even printed a poem by one of the leading figures in Romanian Symbolism, [[Alexandru Macedonski]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; ''Simbolul'' also featured illustrations by Maniu, Millian and [[Iosif Iser]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.50, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tzara, Maxy, Vinea, Costin (1915).jpg|thumb|300px|The ''[[Chemarea]]'' circle in 1915. From left: Tzara, [[M. H. Maxy]], [[Ion Vinea]], and [[Jacques G. Costin]]]]
Although the magazine ceased print in December 1912, it played an important part in shaping [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] of the period. Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] sees ''Simbolul'' as a main stage in Romania's [[modernism]], and credits it with having brought about the first changes from Symbolism to the radical avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49-54, 397-398, 412&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Cernat, the collaboration between Samyro, Vinea and Janco was an early instance of literature becoming "an interface between arts", which had for its contemporary equivalent the collaboration between Iser and writers such as [[Ion Minulescu]] and [[Tudor Arghezi]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Although Maniu parted with the group and sought a change in style which brought him closer to traditionalist tenets, Tzara, Janco and Vinea continued their collaboration. Between 1913 and 1915, they were frequently vacationing together, either on the [[Black Sea]] coast or at the Rosenstock family property in [[Gârceni]], [[Vaslui County]]; during this time, Vinea and Samyro wrote poems with similar themes and alluding to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116-121&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Chemarea'' and 1915 departure===
Tzara's career changed course between 1914 and 1916, during a period when the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] kept out of [[World War I]]. In autumn 1915, as founder and editor of the short-lived journal ''[[Chemarea]]'', Vinea published two poems by his friend, the first printed works to bear the signature ''Tristan Tzara''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97, 106, 108-109&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the young poet and many of his friends were adherents of an [[anti-war]] and anti-[[Nationalism|nationalist]] current, which progressively accommodated [[anti-establishment]] messages.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.99, 100-108&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chemarea'', which was a platform for this agenda and again attracted collaborations from Chapier, may also have been financed by Tzara and Vinea.&lt;ref name="pcern99"/&gt; According to Romanian avant-garde writer [[Claude Sernet]], the journal was "totally different from everything that had been printed in Romania before that moment."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, Tzara's works were sporadically published in Hefter-Hidalgo's ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'', and, in June 1915, [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]'s ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'' published Samyro's known poem ''Verișoară, fată de pension'' ("Little Cousin, Boarding School Girl").&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.108-109"/&gt;

Tzara had enrolled at the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1914, studying mathematics and philosophy, but did not graduate.&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ttunifi"&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/CMpro-v-p-1020.html "Tristan Tzara"], biographical note in [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/ ''Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780-1914)'' database], at the [[University of Florence]]'s Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 1915, he left Romania for Zürich, in neutral Switzerland. Janco, together with his brother [[Jules Janco|Jules]], had settled there a few months before, and was later joined by his other brother [[Georges Janco|Georges]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110-111&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara, who may have applied for the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[University of Zurich|local university]],&lt;ref name="iliv241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mrdada"&gt;Marta Ragozzino, "Tristan Tzara", in ''Art e Dossier'', March 1994, Giunti, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; shared lodging with Marcel Janco, who was a student at the ''[[ETH Zurich|Technische Hochschule]]'', in the Altinger Guest House&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; (by 1918, Tzara had moved to the Limmatquai Hotel).&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; His departure from Romania, like that of the Janco brothers, may have been in part a [[Pacifism|pacifist]] political statement.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.132; Livezeanu, p.241, 249&lt;/ref&gt; After settling in Switzerland, the young poet almost completely discarded Romanian as his language of expression, writing most of his subsequent works in French.&lt;ref name="ttunifi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The poems he had written before, which were the result of poetic dialogues between him and his friend, were left in Vinea's care.&lt;ref name="pcern116"&gt;Cernat, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these pieces were first printed only in the [[interwar period]].&lt;ref name="ttunifi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116, 130, 138, 153&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in Zürich that the Romanian group met with the [[German Empire|German]] [[Hugo Ball]], an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] poet and pianist, and his young wife [[Emmy Hennings]], a [[music hall]] performer. In February 1916, Ball had rented the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] from its owner, Jan Ephraim, and intended to use the venue for [[performance art]] and exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110-111; Hofman, p.2; Richter, p.12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo Ball recorded this period, noting that Tzara and Marcel Janco, like [[Hans Arp]], [[Arthur Segal (painter)|Arthur Segal]], [[Otto van Rees]], [[Max Oppenheimer]], and [[Marcel Słodki]], "readily agreed to take part in the cabaret."&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14"&gt;Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ball, among the performances of songs mimicking or taking inspiration from various national [[folklore]]s, "Herr Tristan Tzara recited Rumanian poetry&lt;!-- sic --&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111; Gendron, p.73; Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; In late March, Ball recounted, the group was joined by German writer and drummer [[Richard Huelsenbeck]].&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14"/&gt; He was soon after involved in Tzara's "simultaneist verse" performance, "the first in Zürich and in the world", also including renditions of poems by two promoters of [[Cubism]], [[Fernand Divoire]] and [[Henri Barzun]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111; Richter, p.14, 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of Dada===
[[File:Placa en Cabaret Voltaire retouched.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] plaque commemorating the birth of Dada]]
It was in this milieu that [[Dada]] was born, at some point before May 1916, when a publication of the same name first saw print. The story of its establishment was the subject of a disagreement between Tzara and his fellow writers. Cernat believes that the first Dadaist performance took place as early as February, when the nineteen-year-old Tzara, wearing a [[monocle]], entered the Cabaret Voltaire stage singing sentimental melodies and handing paper wads to his "scandalized spectators", leaving the stage to allow room for masked actors on [[stilts]], and returning in clown attire.&lt;ref name="pcern112"&gt;Cernat, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; The same type of performances took place at the [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zunfthaus zur Waag]] beginning in summer 1916, after the Cabaret Voltaire was forced to close down.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Gendron, p.73-75; Hofman, p.3; Richter, p.39, 41-44, 48&lt;/ref&gt; According to music historian Bernard Gendron, for as long as it lasted, "the Cabaret Voltaire was dada. There was no alternative institution or site that could disentangle 'pure' dada from its mere accompaniment [...] nor was any such site desired."&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; Other opinions link Dada's beginnings with much earlier events, including the experiments of [[Alfred Jarry]], [[André Gide]], [[Christian Morgenstern]], [[Jean-Pierre Brisset]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Jacques Vaché]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] or [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.11, 71-72, 81-100, 168-173&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first of the movement's manifestos, Ball wrote: "[The booklet] is intended to present to the Public the activities and interests of the Cabaret Voltaire, which has as its sole purpose to draw attention, across the barriers of war and nationalism, to the few independent spirits who live for other ideals. The next objective of the artists who are assembled here is to publish a ''revue internationale'' [French for "international magazine"]."&lt;ref name="hrich14"&gt;Richter, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Ball completed his message in French, and the paragraph translates as: "The magazine shall be published in Zürich and shall carry the name 'Dada' ('Dada'). Dada Dada Dada Dada."&lt;ref name="hrich14"/&gt; The view according to which Ball had created the movement was notably supported by writer [[Walter Serner]], who directly accused Tzara of having abused Ball's initiative.&lt;ref name="hrich123"&gt;Richter, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary point of contention between the founders of Dada regarded the paternity for the movement's name, which, according to visual artist and essayist [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], was first adopted in print in June 1916.&lt;ref name="hrich32"&gt;Richter, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Ball, who claimed authorship and stated that he picked the word randomly from a dictionary, indicated that it stood for both the French-language equivalent of "[[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]]" and a [[German language|German-language]] term reflecting the joy of children being rocked to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115-116; Richter, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara himself declined interest in the matter, but Marcel Janco credited him with having coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115-116&lt;/ref&gt; Dada manifestos, written or co-authored by Tzara, record that the name shares its form with various other terms, including a word used in the [[Kru languages]] of [[West Africa]] to designate the tail of a sacred cow; a toy and the name for "mother" in an unspecified [[Regional Italian|Italian dialect]]; and the double affirmative in Romanian and in various [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.116; Londré, p.397; Richter, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dadaist promoter===
Before the end of the war, Tzara had assumed a position as Dada's main promoter and manager, helping the Swiss group establish branches in other European countries.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529; Hofman, p.3-4; Cernat, p.115; Livezeanu, p.249-251; Londré, p.396; Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the first conflict within the group: citing irreconcilable differences with Tzara, Ball left the group.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.43, 59&lt;/ref&gt; With his departure, Gendron argues, Tzara was able to move Dada [[vaudeville]]-like performances into more of "an incendiary and yet jocularly provocative theater."&lt;ref name="bgend77"&gt;Gendron, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

He is often credited with having inspired many young modernist authors from outside Switzerland to affiliate with the group, in particular the Frenchmen [[Louis Aragon]], [[André Breton]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] and [[Philippe Soupault]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrich33"&gt;Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Richter, who also came into contact with Dada at this stage in its history, notes that these intellectuals often had a "very cool and distant attitude to this new movement" before being approached by the Romanian author.&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; In June 1916, he began editing and managing the periodical ''Dada'' as a successor of the short-lived magazine ''Cabaret Voltaire''—Richter describes his "energy, passion and talent for the job", which he claims satisfied all Dadaists.&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.4; Richter, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the time the lover of [[Maja Kruscek]], who was a student of [[Rudolf Laban]]; in Richter's account, their relationship was always tottering.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.45, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1916, Tristan Tzara took distance from the Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]], rejecting the [[Militarism|militarist]] and proto-[[Italian fascism|fascist]] stance of their leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; Richter notes that, by then, Dada had replaced Futurism as the leader of modernism, while continuing to build on its influence: "we had swallowed Futurism—bones, feathers and all. It is true that in the process of digestion all sorts of bones and feathers had been regurgitated."&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; Despite this and the fact that Dada did not make any gains in Italy, Tzara could count poets [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] and [[Alberto Savinio]], painters [[Gino Cantarelli]] and [[Aldo Fiozzi]], as well as a few other Italian Futurists, among the Dadaists.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.199, 201 (Haftmann, in Richter, p.217)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Italian authors supporting Dadaist manifestos and rallying with the Dada group was the poet, painter and in the future a fascist racial theorist [[Julius Evola]], who became a personal friend of Tzara.&lt;ref name="buddevo"&gt;S. Batchelor, "Existence, Enlightenment and Suicide: The Dilemma of Nanavira Thera", in Tadeusz Skorupski (ed.), ''The Buddhist Forum'', Vol. IV (Seminar Papers 1994-1996), [[Routledge]], London, 1996, p.11-13. {{ISBN|0-7286-0255-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, Tzara and Ball opened the ''Galerie Dada'' permanent exhibit, through which they set contacts with the independent Italian visual artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and with the German [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] journal ''[[Der Sturm]]'', all of whom were described as "fathers of Dada".&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.39-40, 46&lt;/ref&gt; During the same months, and probably owing to Tzara's intervention, the Dada group organized a performance of ''Sphinx and Strawman'', a puppet play by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]], whom he advertised as an example of "Dada theater".&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.173-174&lt;/ref&gt; He was also in touch with ''[[Nord-Sud]]'', the magazine of French poet [[Pierre Reverdy]] (who sought to unify all avant-garde trends),&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; and contributed articles on [[African art]] to both ''Nord-Sud'' and [[Pierre Albert-Birot]]'s ''SIC'' magazine.&lt;ref name="hrich167"&gt;Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1918, through Huelsenbeck, Zürich Dadaists established contacts with their more explicitly [[left-wing]] disciples in the German Empire—[[George Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Walter Mehring]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Carl Einstein]], [[Franz Jung]], and Heartfield's brother [[Wieland Herzfelde]].&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.7-8; Richter, p.102-114&lt;/ref&gt; With Breton, Soupault and Aragon, Tzara traveled [[Cologne]], where he became familiarized with the elaborate [[collage]] works of Schwitters and [[Max Ernst]], which he showed to his colleagues in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.137, 155, 159&lt;/ref&gt; Huelsenbeck nonetheless declined to Schwitters membership in Berlin Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.397; Richter, p.137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his campaigning, Tzara created a list of so-called "Dada presidents", who represented various regions of Europe. According to Hans Richter, it included, alongside Tzara himself, figures ranging from Ernst, Arp, Baader, Breton and Aragon to Kruscek, Evola, [[Rafael Lasso de la Vega]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Vicente Huidobro]], [[Francesco Meriano]] and [[Théodore Fraenkel]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.201&lt;/ref&gt; Richter notes: "I'm not sure if all the names who appear here would agree with the description."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.200-201&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of World War I===
The shows Tzara staged in Zürich often turned into scandals or riots, and he was in permanent conflict with the [[Law enforcement in Switzerland|Swiss law enforcers]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115; Richter, p.16, 19, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Richter speaks of a "pleasure of letting fly at the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], which in Tristan Tzara took the form of coldly (or hotly) calculated insolence" (''see [[Épater la bourgeoisie]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, as part of a series of events in which Dadaists mocked established authors, Tzara and Arp falsely publicized that they were going to fight a [[duel]] in Rehalp, near Zürich, and that they were going to have the popular novelist [[Jakob Christoph Heer]] for their witness.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.66-67&lt;/ref&gt; Richter also reports that his Romanian colleague profited from Swiss neutrality to play the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and [[Central Powers]] against each other, obtaining art works and funds from both, making use of their need to stimulate their respective [[propaganda]] efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.47-48&lt;/ref&gt; While active as a promoter, Tzara also published his first volume of collected poetry, the 1918 ''Vingt-cinq poèmes'' ("Twenty-five Poems").&lt;ref name="rcard530"&gt;Cardinal, p.530&lt;/ref&gt;

A major event took place in autumn 1918, when [[Francis Picabia]], who was then publisher of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]'' magazine and a distant Dada affiliate, visited Zürich and introduced his colleagues there to his [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] views on art and reason.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.70-74&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], Picabia, [[Man Ray]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] had earlier set up their own version of Dada. This circle, based in New York City, sought affiliation with Tzara's only in 1921, when they jokingly asked him to grant them permission to use "Dada" as their own name (to which Tzara replied: "Dada belongs to everybody").&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The visit was credited by Richter with boosting the Romanian author's status, but also with making Tzara himself "switch suddenly from a position of balance between art and [[anti-art]] into the [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] regions of pure and joyful nothingness."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; The movement subsequently organized its last major Swiss show, held at the Saal zur Kaufleutern, with choreography by [[Susanne Perrottet]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], and with the participation of [[Käthe Wulff]], [[Hans Heusser]], Tzara, Hans Richter and [[Walter Serner]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.74-78&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that Serner read from his 1918 essay, whose very title advocated ''Letzte Lockerung'' ("Final Dissolution"): this part is believed to have caused the subsequent mêlée, during which the public attacked the performers and succeeded in interrupting, but not canceling, the show.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.78-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the November 1918 [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]], Dada's evolution was marked by political developments. In October 1919, Tzara, Arp and [[Otto Flake]] began publishing ''[[Der Zeltweg]]'', a journal aimed at further popularizing Dada in a post-war world were the borders were again accessible.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"&gt;Richter, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Richter, who admits that the magazine was "rather tame", also notes that Tzara and his colleagues were dealing with the impact of [[communist revolution]]s, in particular the [[October Revolution]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German revolts of 1918]], which "had stirred men's minds, divided men's interests and diverted energies in the direction of political change."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"/&gt; The same commentator however dismisses those accounts which, he believes, led readers to believe that ''Der Zeltweg'' was "an association of revolutionary artists."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.80"/&gt; According to one account rendered by historian Robert Levy, Tzara shared company with a group of Romanian [[Communism|communist]] students, and, as such, may have met with [[Ana Pauker]], who was later one of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]'s most prominent activists.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Levy, ''Ana Pauker: The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, p.37. {{ISBN|0-520-22395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arp and Janco drifted away from the movement ca. 1919, when they created the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]]-inspired workshop ''[[Das Neue Leben]]''.&lt;ref name="pcern115"&gt;Cernat, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.121-123, 181-183&lt;/ref&gt; When Vinea submitted his poem ''Doleanțe'' ("Grievances") to be published by Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.123-124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Dada===
[[File:Jane Heap, John Rodker, Martha Dennison, Tristan Tzara, Margaret Anderson, ca. 1920s.jpg|thumb|330px|Tzara (second from right) in the 1920s, with [[Margaret C. Anderson]], [[Jane Heap]], and [[John Rodker]]]]
In late 1919, Tristan Tzara left Switzerland to join Breton, Soupault and [[Claude Rivière]] in editing the Paris-based magazine ''[[Littérature]]''.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529-530; Hofman, p.12-14; Richter, p.167, 173&lt;/ref&gt; Already a mentor for the French avant-garde, he was, according to Hans Richter, perceived as an "Anti-[[Messiah]]" and a "prophet".&lt;ref name="hrich168"&gt;Richter, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Dada mythology had it that he entered the French capital in a snow-white or lilac-colored car, passing down [[Boulevard Raspail]] through a [[triumphal arch]] made from his own pamphlets, being greeted by cheering crowds and a fireworks display.&lt;ref name="hrich168"/&gt; Richter dismisses this account, indicating that Tzara actually walked from [[Gare de l'Est]] to Picabia's home, without anyone expecting him to arrive.&lt;ref name="hrich168"/&gt;

He is often described as the main figure in the ''Littérature'' circle, and credited with having more firmly set its artistic principles in the line of Dada.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13; Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; When Picabia began publishing a new series of ''391'' in Paris, Tzara seconded him and, Richter says, produced issues of the magazine "decked out [...] in all the colors of Dada."&lt;ref name="hrich167"/&gt; He was also issuing his ''Dada'' magazine, printed in Paris but using the same format, renaming it ''Bulletin Dada'' and later ''Dadaphone''.&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13-14; Richter, p.173, 179-180&lt;/ref&gt; At around that time, he met American author [[Gertrude Stein]], who wrote about him in ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"''Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''", in ''The Cambridge Handbook of American Literature'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 1986 p.13. {{ISBN|0-521-30703-1}}; Armstrong, p.496&lt;/ref&gt; and the artist couple [[Robert Delaunay|Robert]] and [[Sonia Delaunay]] (with whom he worked in tandem for "poem-dresses" and other simultaneist literary pieces).&lt;ref name="tgdelau"&gt;Tag Gronberg, "Sonia Delaunay's Simultaneous Fashions and the Modern Woman", in Whitney Chadwick, Tirza True Latimer (eds.), ''The Modern Woman Revisited: Paris between the Wars'', [[Rutgers University Press]], Piscataway, p.114-115. {{ISBN|0-8135-3292-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzara became involved in a number of Dada experiments, on which he collaborated with Breton, Aragon, Soupault, Picabia or [[Paul Éluard]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/tzara-tristan "Tristan Tzara 1896–1963"], in Susan Salas, Laura Wisner-Broyles, ''Poetry Criticism'', Vol. 27, Gale Group Inc., 2000, [http://www.enotes.com/ eNotes.com]; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.13; Richter, p.173-176&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors who came into contact with Dada at that stage were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Dermée]] and [[Raymond Radiguet]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.173-174&lt;/ref&gt; The performances staged by Dada were often meant to popularize its principles, and Dada continued to draw attention on itself by [[hoax]]es and [[false advertising]], announcing that the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film star [[Charlie Chaplin]] was going to appear on stage at its show,&lt;ref name="bgend77"/&gt; or that its members were going to have their heads shaved or their hair cut off on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.77; Richter, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, Tzara and his associates lectured at the ''[[Université populaire]]'' in front of industrial workers, who were reportedly less than impressed.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.175-176"&gt;Richter, p.175-176&lt;/ref&gt; Richter believes that, ideologically, Tzara was still in tribute to Picabia's nihilistic and anarchic views (which made the Dadaists attack all political and cultural ideologies), but that this also implied a measure of sympathy for the [[working class]].&lt;ref name="Richter, p.175-176"/&gt;

Dada activities in Paris culminated in the March 1920 [[variety show]] at the [[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]], which featured readings from Breton, Picabia, Dermée and Tzara's earlier work, ''La Première aventure céleste de M. Antipyrine'' ("The First Heavenly Adventure of Mr. Antipyrine").&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.398; Richter, p.179-183&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's melody, ''Vaseline symphonique'' ("Symphonic Vaseline"), which required ten or twenty people to shout "cra" and "cri" on a rising scale, was also performed.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.77; Richter, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; A scandal erupted when Breton read Picabia's ''Manifeste cannibale'' ("Cannibal Manifesto"), lashing out at the audience and mocking them, to which they answered by aiming rotten fruit at the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.180-182&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dada phenomenon was only noticed in Romania beginning in 1920, and its overall reception was negative. Traditionalist historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], Symbolist promoter [[Ovid Densusianu]], the more reserved modernists [[Camil Petrescu]] and [[Benjamin Fondane]] all refused to accept it as a valid artistic manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; Although he rallied with tradition, Vinea defended the subversive current in front of more serious criticism, and rejected the widespread rumor that Tzara had acted as an [[agent of influence]] for the [[Central Powers]] during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugen Lovinescu]], editor of ''[[Sburătorul]]'' and one of Vinea's rivals on the modernist scene, acknowledged the influence exercised by Tzara on the younger avant-garde authors, but analyzed his work only briefly, using as an example one of his pre-Dada poems, and depicting him as an advocate of literary "extremism".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.126-127, 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada stagnation===
[[File:St-Julien-le-Pauvre &amp; houses.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]], site of the 1921 "Dada excursion"]]
By 1921, Tzara had become involved in conflicts with other figures in the movement, whom he claimed had parted with the spirit of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127-128; Richter, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt; He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with [[Raoul Hausmann]] over leadership status.&lt;ref name="hrich123"/&gt; According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish to do away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.182-183, 192-193&lt;/ref&gt; The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;

A more serious crisis occurred in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of [[Maurice Barrès]], whose early affiliation with the Symbolists had been shadowed by his [[antisemitism]] and [[reactionary]] stance: [[Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes]] was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the defense attorneys, with Tzara, Ungaretti, [[Benjamin Péret]] and others as witnesses (a [[mannequin]] stood in for Barrès).&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184-186&lt;/ref&gt; Péret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an absurd one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184, 186&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.184-185&lt;/ref&gt; During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, [[Maja Kruschek]] and Tzara were in Austria, at [[Imst]], where they published their last manifesto as a group, ''Dada au grand air'' ("Dada in the Open Air") or ''Der Sängerkrieg in Tirol'' ("The Battle of the Singers in [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]").&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.186 (illustration 96)&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara also visited [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Czechoslovakia]], where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1921, Ion Vinea wrote an article for the Romanian newspaper ''[[Adevărul]]'', arguing that the movement had exhausted itself (although, in his letters to Tzara, he continued to ask his friend to return home and spread his message there).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.127-128&lt;/ref&gt; After July 1922, Marcel Janco rallied with Vinea in editing ''[[Contimporanul]]'', which published some of Tzara's earliest poems but never offered space to any Dadaist manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.130, 138, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, the conflict between Tzara and Janco had a personal note: Janco later mentioned "some dramatic quarrels" between his colleague and him.&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; They avoided each other for the rest of their lives and Tzara even struck out the dedications to Janco from his early poems.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.115, 137&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Evola]] also grew disappointed by the movement's total rejection of tradition and began his personal search for an alternative, pursuing a path which later led him to [[esotericism]] and fascism.&lt;ref name="buddevo"/&gt;

===''Evening of the Bearded Heart''===
[[File:Theo van Doesburg kleine Dada soirée.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Theo van Doesburg]]'s poster for a Dada soirée (ca.1923)]]
Tzara was openly attacked by Breton in a February 1922 article for ''[[Le Journal de Peuple]]'', where the Romanian writer was denounced as "an impostor" avid for "publicity".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.114; Richter, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; In March, Breton initiated the ''Congress for the Determination and Defense of the Modern Spirit''. The French writer used the occasion to strike out Tzara's name from among the Dadaists, citing in his support Dada's Huelsenbeck, Serner, and [[Christian Schad]].&lt;ref name="pcern114"&gt;Cernat, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Basing his statement on a note supposedly authored by Huelsenbeck, Breton also accused Tzara of opportunism, claiming that he had planned wartime editions of Dada works in such a manner as not to upset actors on the political stage, making sure that German Dadaists were not made available to the public in countries subject to the [[Supreme War Council]].&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; Tzara, who attended the Congress only as a means to subvert it,&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.187&lt;/ref&gt; responded to the accusations the same month, arguing that Huelsenbeck's note was fabricated and that Schad had not been one of the original Dadaists.&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; Rumors reported much later by American writer [[Brion Gysin]] had it that Breton's claims also depicted Tzara as an informer for the [[Prefecture of Police]].&lt;ref name="nzgysin"&gt;[[Nicholas Zurbrugg]], "Brion Gysin", in ''Art, Performance, Media: 31 Interviews'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], Minneapolis, p.190. {{ISBN|0-8166-3832-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1922, Dada staged its own funeral.&lt;ref name="Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191"&gt;Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hans Richter, the main part of this took place in [[Weimar]], where the Dadaists attended a festival of the [[Bauhaus]] art school, during which Tzara proclaimed the elusive nature of his art: "Dada is useless, like everything else in life. [...] Dada is a virgin microbe which penetrates with the insistence of air into all those spaces that reason has failed to fill with words and conventions."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Bearded Heart" manifesto a number of artists backed the marginalization of Breton in support of Tzara. Alongside Cocteau, Arp, Ribemont-Dessaignes, and Éluard, the pro-Tzara faction included [[Erik Satie]], [[Theo van Doesburg]], [[Serge Charchoune]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Ossip Zadkine]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Ilia Zdanevich]], and [[Man Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; During an associated soirée, ''Evening of the Bearded Heart'', which began on 6 July 1923, Tzara presented a re-staging of his play ''[[The Gas Heart]]'' (which had been first performed two years earlier to howls of derision from its audience), for which [[Sonia Delaunay]] designed the costumes.&lt;ref name="tgdelau"/&gt; Breton interrupted its performance and reportedly fought with several of his former associates and broke furniture, prompting a theatre riot that only the intervention of the police halted.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Dada's vaudeville declined in importance and disappeared altogether after that date.&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

Picabia took Breton's side against Tzara,&lt;ref&gt;Hofman, p.15; Richter, p.188, 190&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced the staff of his ''391'', enlisting collaborations from [[Clément Pansaers]] and [[Ezra Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.188, 190&lt;/ref&gt; Breton marked the end of Dada in 1924, when he issued the first ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. Richter suggests that "Surrealism devoured and digested Dada."&lt;ref name="Londré, p.398; Richter, p.191"/&gt; Tzara distanced himself from new trend, disagreeing with its methods and, increasingly, with its politics.&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239-240&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, he and a few other former Dadaists collaborated with Richter and the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] artist [[El Lissitzky]] on the magazine ''G'',&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, in Richter, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; and, the following year, he wrote pieces for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]-[[Slovenia]]n magazine ''Tank'' (edited by [[Ferdinand Delak]]).&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.315&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to Surrealism===
[[File:Paris 18 - Maison Tristan Tzara -1.JPG|thumb|230px|''Maison Tzara'', designed by [[Adolf Loos]]]]
Tzara continued to write, becoming more seriously interested in the theater. In 1924, he published and staged the play ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'', which was soon included in the repertoire of [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s ''[[Ballets Russes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Garafola, ''Legacies of Twentieth-century Dance'', [[Wesleyan University Press]], Middletown, 2005, p.172. {{ISBN|0-8195-6674-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also collected his earlier Dada texts as the ''Seven Dada Manifestos''. [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinker [[Henri Lefebvre]] reviewed them enthusiastically; he later became one of the author's friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Jay]], ''Marxism and Totality: the Adventures of a Concept from Lukács to Habermas'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 1984, p.293 {{ISBN|0-520-05742-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Romania, Tzara's work was partly recuperated by ''Contimporanul'', which notably staged public readings of his works during the international art exhibit it organized in 1924, and again during the "new art demonstration" of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.153, 156, 159, 186&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the short-lived magazine ''Integral'', where [[Ilarie Voronca]] and [[Ion Călugăru]] were the main animators, took significant interest in Tzara's work.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239-240, 277, 279, 287&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1927 interview with the publication, he voiced his opposition to the Surrealist group's adoption of communism, indicating that such politics could only result in a "new bourgeoisie" being created, and explaining that he had opted for a personal "[[permanent revolution]]", which would preserve "the holiness of the ego".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, Tristan Tzara was in [[Stockholm]], where he married [[Greta Knutson]], with whom he had a son, Christophe (born 1927).&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; A former student of painter [[André Lhote]], she was known for her interest in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[abstract art]].&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"&gt;"Greta Knutson", in [[Penelope Rosemont]], ''[[Surrealist Women]]'', [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], London &amp; New York, 1998, p.69. {{ISBN|0-485-30088-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same period, with funds from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned [[Austria]]n architect [[Adolf Loos]], a former representative of the [[Vienna Secession]] whom he had met in Zürich, to build him a house in Paris.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; The rigidly [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] ''Maison Tristan Tzara'', built in [[Montmartre]], was designed following Tzara's specific requirements and decorated with samples of [[African art]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; It was Loos' only major contribution in his Parisian years.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;

In 1929, he reconciled with Breton, and sporadically attended the Surrealists' meetings in Paris.&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; The same year, he issued the poetry book ''De nos oiseaux'' ("Of Our Birds").&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; This period saw the publication of ''[[The Approximate Man]]'' (1931), alongside the volumes ''L'Arbre des voyageurs'' ("The Travelers' Tree", 1930), ''Où boivent les loups'' ("Where Wolves Drink", 1932), ''L'Antitête'' ("The Antihead", 1933) and ''Grains et issues'' ("Seed and Bran", 1935).&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; By then, it was also announced that Tzara had started work on a screenplay.&lt;ref name="pcern277"&gt;Cernat, p.277&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he directed and produced a cinematic version of ''Le Cœur à barbe'', starring Breton and other leading Surrealists.&lt;ref name="ttzimdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0879262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, he signed his name to ''The Testimony against [[Gertrude Stein]]'', published by [[Eugene Jolas]]'s magazine ''[[transition (literary journal)|transition]]'' in reply to Stein's memoir ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]'',&lt;!-- sic --&gt; in which he accused his former friend of being a [[megalomania]]c.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p.496&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet became involved in further developing [[Surrealist techniques]], and, together with Breton and [[Valentine Hugo]], drew one of the better-known examples of "[[exquisite corpse]]s".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ion Biberi]], ''Arta suprarealistă'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 1973, p.53. {{OCLC|22905196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara also prefaced a 1934 collection of Surrealist poems by his friend [[René Char]], and the following year he and Greta Knutson visited Char in [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]].&lt;ref&gt;"René Char Bio-Bibliography", in ''Selected Poems of René Char'' (edited by [[Mary Ann Caws]] and Tina Jolas), [[New Directions Publishers]], New York, 1992, p.xii. {{ISBN|0-8112-1191-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's wife was also affiliated with the Surrealist group at around the same time.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"/&gt; This association ended when she parted with Tzara late in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prsurrgk"/&gt;

At home, Tzara's works were collected and edited by the Surrealist promoter [[Sașa Pană]], who corresponded with him over several years.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 106, 109, 116; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.154-155&lt;/ref&gt; The first such edition saw print in 1934, and featured the 1913-1915 poems Tzara had left in Vinea's care.&lt;ref name="pcern116"/&gt; In 1928-1929, Tzara exchanged letters with his friend [[Jacques G. Costin]], a ''Contimporanul'' affiliate who did not share all of Vinea's views on literature, who offered to organize his visit to Romania and asked him to translate his work into French.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.192-194&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affiliation with communism and Spanish Civil War===

Alarmed by the establishment of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], which also signified the end of Berlin's avant-garde, he merged his activities as an art promoter with the cause of [[anti-fascism]], and was close to the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). In 1936, Richter recalled, he published a series of photographs secretly taken by [[Kurt Schwitters]] in [[Hanover]], works which documented the destruction of Nazi propaganda by the locals, [[ration stamp]] with reduced quantities of food, and other hidden aspects of Hitler's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.153&lt;/ref&gt; After the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he briefly left France and joined the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican forces]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.245-246&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] reporter [[Ilya Ehrenburg]], Tzara visited [[Madrid]], which was besieged by the [[Spain under Franco|Nationalists]] (''see [[Siege of Madrid]]'').&lt;ref name="iliv246"&gt;Livezeanu, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, he published the collection of poems ''Midis gagnés'' ("Conquered Southern Regions").&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; Some of them had previously been printed in the brochure ''Les poètes du monde défendent le peuple espagnol'' ("The Poets of the World Defend the Spanish People", 1937), which was edited by two prominent authors and activists, [[Nancy Cunard]] and the Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Robin Suleiman, "Committed Painting", in Denis Hollier (ed.), ''A New History of French Literature'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 1994, p.938. {{ISBN|0-674-61566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara had also signed Cunard's June 1937 call to intervention against [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Jaqueline Lancaster, ''Brian Howard: Portrait of a Failure'', Timewell Press, London, 2005, p.221. {{ISBN|1-85725-211-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he and Nancy Cunard were romantically involved.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Weber, "Nancy Cunard: a Troubled Heiress with an Ideological Mission", in ''[[Int. Her. Trib.|The International Herald Tribune]]'', 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the poet was moving away from Surrealism,&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; his adherence to strict [[Marxism-Leninism]] was reportedly questioned by both the PCF and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="pbeit49"&gt;Beitchman, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semiotics|Semiotician]] Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of [[Utopia]], which combined communist messages with [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] [[psychoanalysis]] and made use of particularly violent imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.48-49&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the [[party line (politics)|party line]], maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.&lt;ref name="spbuot"&gt;{{ro icon}} Sorin Pop, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/*articleID_9669-articles_details.html "François Buot, Tristan Tzara. Omul care a pus la cale revoluția Dada"] (book review), in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 195, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others note that the former Dadaist leader would often show himself a follower of political guidelines. As early as 1934, Tzara, together with Breton, Éluard and communist writer [[René Crevel]], organized an informal trial of independent-minded Surrealist [[Salvador Dalí]], who was at the time a confessed admirer of Hitler, and whose portrait of [[William Tell]] had alarmed them because it shared likeness with [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Rojas, ''Salvador Dalí, or the Art of Spitting on Your Mother's Portrait'', [[Penn State University Press]], University Park, 1993, p.98. {{ISBN|0-271-00842-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Irina Livezeanu]] notes that Tzara, who agreed with [[Stalinism]] and shunned [[Trotskyism]], submitted to the PCF cultural demands during the writers' congress of 1935, even when his friend Crevel committed suicide to protest the adoption of [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref name="iliv251"&gt;Livezeanu, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; At a later stage, Livezeanu remarks, Tzara reinterpreted Dada and Surrealism as revolutionary currents, and presented them as such to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.247-249&lt;/ref&gt; This stance she contrasts with that of Breton, who was more reserved in his attitudes.&lt;ref name="iliv251"/&gt;

===World War II and Resistance===
During [[World War II]], Tzara took refuge from the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation forces]], moving to the southern areas, controlled by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; On one occasion, the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationist]] publication ''[[Je Suis Partout]]'' made his whereabouts known to the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.marianne2.fr/Tristan-Tzara,-radical,-mondain-et-anticonformiste_a41229.html?PHPSESSID=c3682e2fb29f923d2fc35498af3a6907 "Tristan Tzara, radical, mondain et anticonformiste"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]'', 13 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

He was in [[Marseille]] in late 1940-early 1941, joining the group of anti-fascist and Jewish refugees who, protected by American diplomat [[Varian Fry]], were seeking to escape [[Nazi-occupied Europe]]. Among the people present there were the anti-[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] socialist [[Victor Serge]], anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], playwright [[Arthur Adamov]], philosopher and poet [[René Daumal]], and several prominent Surrealists: Breton, Char, and [[Benjamin Péret]], as well as artists [[Max Ernst]], [[André Masson]], [[Wifredo Lam]], [[Jacques Hérold]], [[Victor Brauner]] and [[Óscar Domínguez]].&lt;ref name="dgmarse"&gt;Danièle Giraudy, Musée de Marseille (eds.), ''Le jeu de Marseille: autour d'André Breton et des surréalistes à Marseille en 1940-1941'', Éditions Alors Hors du Temps, Marseille, p.79sqq&lt;/ref&gt; During the months spent together, and before some of them received permission to leave for America, they invented a new [[card game]], on which traditional card imagery was replaced with Surrealist symbols.&lt;ref name="dgmarse"/&gt;

Some time after his stay in Marseille, Tzara joined the [[French Resistance]], rallying with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]. A contributor to magazines published by the Resistance, Tzara also took charge of the cultural broadcast for the [[Free French Forces]] clandestine radio station.&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He lived in [[Aix-en-Provence]], then in [[Souillac, Lot|Souillac]], and ultimately in [[Toulouse]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; His son Cristophe was at the time a Resistant in northern France, having joined the ''[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]]''.&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt; In [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-allied and antisemitic Romania (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), the regime of [[Ion Antonescu]] ordered bookstores not to sell works by Tzara and 44 other Jewish-Romanian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radu Ioanid]], "The Romanian Press: Preparing the Ground for the Holocaust and Reporting on Its Implementation", in Robert Moses Shapiro, ''Why Didn't the Press Shout?: American and International Journalism during the Holocaust'', Ktav, Hoboken, 2003, p.404. {{ISBN|0-88125-775-3}}; {{ro icon}} Liviu Rotman (ed.), ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110818231335/http://jewishfed.ro/fcer/public_html/downloads/carti/Demnitate.pdf Demnitate în vremuri de restriște]'', [[Editura Hasefer]], [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania]] &amp; [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania]], Bucharest, 2008, p.174-175. {{ISBN|978-973-630-189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, with the generalization of antisemitic measures, Tzara was also stripped of his Romanian citizenship rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Niculescu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/index.html/articles|details?articleID=23639 "Destinul excepțional al lui Alexandru Șafran"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 523, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1944, five months after the [[Liberation of Paris]], he was contributing to ''[[L'Éternelle Revue]]'', a pro-communist newspaper edited by philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], through which Sartre was publicizing the heroic image of a France united in resistance, as opposed to the perception that it had passively accepted German control.&lt;ref name="srsmemor"&gt;Susan Rubin Suleiman, ''Crises of Memory and the Second World War'', [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, 2006, p.30-31. {{ISBN|0-674-02206-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contributors included writers Aragon, Char, Éluard, [[Elsa Triolet]], [[Eugène Guillevic]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Francis Ponge]], [[Jacques Prévert]] and painter [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref name="srsmemor"/&gt;

Upon the end of the war and the restoration of French independence, Tzara was [[Naturalization|naturalized]] a French citizen.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; During 1945, under the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], he was a representative of the Sud-Ouest region to the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name="iliv246"/&gt; According to Livezeanu, he "helped reclaim the [[Southern France|South]] from the cultural figures who had associated themselves to Vichy [France]."&lt;ref name="iliv251"/&gt; In April 1946, his early poems, alongside similar pieces by Breton, Éluard, Aragon and Dalí, were the subject of a midnight broadcast on [[Radio in Paris|Parisian Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;"Drop Everything, Drop Dado", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 8 April 1946&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he became a full member of the PCF&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; (according to some sources, he had been one since 1934).&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;

===International leftism===
Over the following decade, Tzara lent his support to political causes. Pursuing his interest in [[primitivism]], he became a critic of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]'s [[French colonial empires|colonial policy]], and joined his voice to those who supported [[decolonization]].&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; Nevertheless, he was appointed [[cultural ambassador]] of the Republic by the [[Paul Ramadier]] cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p.244, 246, 247&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in the PCF-organized Congress of Writers, but, unlike Éluard and Aragon, again avoided adapting his style to [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;

He returned to Romania on an official visit in late 1946-early 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.113; Livezeanu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"&gt;{{ro icon}} János Farkas, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=154 "Tristan Tzara în Ungaria.

In 1949-1950, Tzara answered Aragon's call and become active in the international campaign to liberate [[Nazım Hikmet]], a [[Turkey|Turkish]] poet whose 1938 arrest for communist activities had created a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' for the pro-Soviet public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.212, 318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcmusic"&gt;Mark Carroll, ''Music and Ideology in Cold War Europe'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2003, p.52. {{ISBN|0-521-82072-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara chaired the Committee for the Liberation of Nazım Hikmet, which issued petitions to national governments&lt;ref name="mcmusic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.212&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned works in honor of Hikmet (including musical pieces by [[Louis Durey]] and [[Serge Nigg]]).&lt;ref name="mcmusic"/&gt; Hikmet was eventually released in July 1950, and publicly thanked Tzara during his subsequent visit to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Göksu &amp; Timms, p.318&lt;/ref&gt;

His works of the period include, among others: ''Le Signe de vie'' ("Sign of Life", 1946), ''Terre sur terre'' ("Earth on Earth", 1946), ''Sans coup férir'' ("Without a Need to Fight", 1949), ''De mémoire d'homme'' ("From a Man's Memory", 1950), ''Parler seul'' ("Speaking Alone", 1950), and ''La Face intérieure'' ("The Inner Face", 1953), followed in 1955 by ''À haute flamme'' ("Flame out Loud") and ''Le Temps naissant'' ("The Nascent Time"), and the 1956 ''Le Fruit permis'' ("The Permitted Fruit").&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="imjbokks"&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/dada_surrealism/pdf/books%20from%20schwarz%20catalog-3.pdf ''Books in the Vera and Arturo Schwarz Collection''], at the [[Israel Museum]]; retrieved 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara continued to be an active promoter of modernist culture. Around 1949, having read [[Ireland|Irish]] author [[Samuel Beckett]]'s manuscript of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', Tzara facilitated the play's staging by approaching producer [[Roger Blin]].&lt;ref name="dbgodot"&gt;[[David Bradby]], ''Beckett: Waiting for Godot'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 2001, p.46. {{ISBN|0-521-59510-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated into French some poems by Hikmet&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Vargaftig (ed.), ''Poésies de Résistence'', J'ai lu, Paris, 1994. {{ISBN|2-277-23767-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hungarian author [[Attila József]].&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; In 1949, he introduced Picasso to art dealer [[Heinz Berggruen]] (thus helping start their lifelong partnership),&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding
"Obituary: Heinz Berggruen, Noted Art Dealer and Collector", in ''[[Int. Her. Trib.|The International Herald Tribune]]'', 26 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1951, wrote the catalog for an exhibit of works by his friend [[Max Ernst]]; the text celebrated the artist's "free use of stimuli" and "his discovery of a new kind of humor."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

===1956 protest and final years===
[[File:Tristan Tzara grave.jpg|thumb|240px|Tzara's grave in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]
In October 1956, Tzara visited the [[People's Republic of Hungary]], where the government of [[Imre Nagy]] was coming into conflict with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; This followed an invitation on the part of Hungarian writer [[Gyula Illyés]], who wanted his colleague to be present at ceremonies marking the [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] of [[László Rajk]] (a local communist leader whose prosecution had been ordered by [[Joseph Stalin]]).&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; Tzara was receptive of the Hungarians' demand for [[liberalization]],&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; contacted the anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and former Dadaist [[Lajos Kassák]], and deemed the anti-Soviet movement "revolutionary".&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; However, unlike much of Hungarian public opinion, the poet did not recommend emancipation from Soviet control, and described the independence demanded by local writers as "an abstract notion".&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; The statement he issued, widely quoted in the Hungarian and international press, forced a reaction from the PCF: through Aragon's reply, the party deplored the fact that one of its members was being used in support of "[[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and anti-Soviet campaigns."&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt;

His return to France coincided with the outbreak of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], which ended with a Soviet military intervention. On 24 October, Tzara was ordered to a PCF meeting, where activist [[Laurent Casanova]] reportedly ordered him to keep silent, which Tzara did.&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt; Tzara's apparent dissidence and the crisis he helped provoke within the Communist Party were celebrated by Breton, who had adopted a pro-Hungarian stance, and who defined his friend and rival as "the first spokesman of the Hungarian demand."&lt;ref name="jfapung"/&gt;

He was thereafter mostly withdrawn from public life, dedicating himself to researching the work of 15th-century poet [[François Villon]],&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; and, like his fellow Surrealist [[Michel Leiris]], to promoting [[Primitivism|primitive]] and [[African art]], which he had been collecting for years.&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt; In early 1957, Tzara attended a Dada retrospective on the [[Rive Gauche]], which ended in a riot caused by the rival avant-garde [[Mouvement Jariviste]], an outcome which reportedly pleased him.&lt;ref&gt;"Battle of the Nihilists", in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 8 April 1957&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1960, one year after the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] had been established by [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]], French forces were confronting the Algerian rebels (''see [[Algerian War]]''). Together with [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[Jérôme Lindon]], [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] and other intellectuals, he addressed [[Prime Minister of France|Premier]] [[Michel Debré]] a letter of protest, concerning France's refusal to grant Algeria its independence.&lt;ref name="laduras"&gt;[[Laure Adler]], ''Marguerite Duras: A Life'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago, 2000, p.233-234. {{ISBN|0-226-00758-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] [[André Malraux]] announced that his cabinet would not subsidize any films to which Tzara and the others might contribute, and the signatories could no longer appear on stations managed by the state-owned [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|French Broadcasting Service]].&lt;ref name="laduras"/&gt;

In 1961, as recognition for his work as a poet, Tzara was awarded the prestigious [[Taormina Prize]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; One of his final public activities took place in 1962, when he attended the [[International Congress on African Culture]], organized by English curator [[Frank McEwen]] and held at the [[National Gallery of Zimbabwe|National Gallery]] in [[Harare|Salisbury]], [[Southern Rhodesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannesburg Art Gallery]], ''Africa Remix: Contemporary Art of a Continent'', [[Jacana Media]], 2007, p.227. {{ISBN|1-77009-363-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died one year later in his Paris home, and was buried at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]].&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;

==Literary contributions==

===Identity issues===
Much critical commentary about Tzara surrounds the measure to which the poet identified with the national cultures which he represented. Paul Cernat notes that the association between Samyro and the Jancos, who were Jews, and their [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] colleagues, was one sign of a cultural dialogue, in which "the openness of Romanian environments toward artistic modernity" was stimulated by "young emancipated Jewish writers."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Salomon Schulman, a Swedish researcher of [[Yiddish literature]], argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and [[Hasidic philosophy]] shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.35-36&lt;/ref&gt; while American poet [[Andrei Codrescu]] speaks of Tzara as one in a [[Balkans|Balkan]] line of "absurdist writing", which also includes the Romanians [[Urmuz]], [[Eugène Ionesco]] and [[Emil Cioran]].&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], Samyro's early poems deal with "the voluptuousness over the strong scents of rural life, which is typical among Jews compressed into [[ghetto]]s."&lt;ref name="gcal887"&gt;Călinescu, p.887&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzara himself used elements alluding to his homeland in his early Dadaist performances. His collaboration with [[Maja Kruscek]] at [[Zünfte of Zürich|Zuntfhaus zür Waag]] featured samples of [[African literature]], to which Tzara added Romanian-language fragments.&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt; He is also known to have mixed elements of [[Romanian folklore]], and to have sung the native suburban [[romanza]] ''La moară la Hârța'' ("At the Mill in Hârța") during at least one staging for Cabaret Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.182, 405&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the Romanian public in 1947, he claimed to have been captivated by "the sweet language of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavian]] peasants".&lt;ref name="iliv246"/&gt;

Tzara nonetheless rebelled against his birthplace and upbringing. His earliest poems depict provincial Moldavia as a desolate and unsettling place. In Cernat's view, this imagery was in common use among Moldavian-born writers who also belonged to the avant-garde trend, notably [[Benjamin Fondane]] and [[George Bacovia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt; Like in the cases of Eugène Ionesco and Fondane, Cernat proposes, Samyro sought self-exile to [[Western Europe]] as a "modern, [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]]" means of breaking with "the peripheral condition",&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; which may also serve to explain the pun he selected for a pseudonym.&lt;ref name="pcern110"/&gt; According to the same author, two important elements in this process were "a maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority", an "[[Oedipus complex]]" which he also argued was evident in the biographies of other Symbolist and avant-garde Romanian authors, from Urmuz to [[Mateiu Caragiale]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Vinea and the ''[[Contimporanul]]'' group, Cernat proposes, Tzara stood for radicalism and insurgency, which would also help explain their impossibility to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.398, 403-405&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Cernat argues, the writer sought to emancipate himself from competing nationalisms, and addressed himself directly to the center of European culture, with [[Zürich]] serving as a stage on his way to [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt; The 1916 ''Monsieur's Antipyrine's Manifesto'' featured a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] appeal: "DADA remains within the framework of European weaknesses, it's still shit, but from now on we want to shit in different colors so as to adorn the zoo of art with all the flags of all the consulates."&lt;ref name="pcern115"/&gt;

With time, Tristan Tzara came to be regarded by his Dada associates as an exotic character, whose attitudes were intrinsically linked with [[Eastern Europe]]. Early on, Ball referred to him and the Janco brothers as "Orientals".&lt;ref name="pcern112"/&gt; [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]] believed him to be a fiery and impulsive figure, having little in common with his German collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.112; Richter, p.18-20, 24, 36, 37, 59&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cernat, Richter's perspective seems to indicate a vision of Tzara having a "[[Italic peoples|Latin]]" temperament.&lt;ref name="pcern112"/&gt; This type of perception also had negative implications for Tzara, particularly after the 1922 split within Dada. In the 1940s, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] alleged that his former colleague had always been separated from other Dadaists by his failure to appreciate the legacy of "[[Humanism in Germany|German humanism]]", and that, compared to his German colleagues, he was "a barbarian".&lt;ref name="pcern114"/&gt; In his polemic with Tzara, Breton also repeatedly placed stress on his rival's foreign origin.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.114, 115; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

At home, Tzara was occasionally targeted for his Jewishness, culminating in the ban enforced by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime. In 1931, [[Const. I. Emilian]], the first Romanian to write an academic study on the avant-garde, attacked him from a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] position. He depicted Dadaists as "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Judaeo-Bolsheviks]]" who corrupted [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and included Tzara among the main proponents of "literary anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.296, 299, 307, 309-310, 329&lt;/ref&gt; Alleging that Tzara's only merit was to establish a literary fashion, while recognizing his "formal virtuosity and artistic intelligence", he claimed to prefer Tzara in his ''[[Simbolul]]'' stage.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.310&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective was deplored early on by the modernist critic [[Perpessicius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years after Emilian's polemic text, [[Fascism|fascist]] poet and journalist [[Radu Gyr]] published an article in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', in which he attacked Tzara as a representative of the "[[Judaism|Judaic]] spirit", of the "foreign plague" and of "[[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]-[[Historical materialism|historical dialectics]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. Ornea]], ''Anii treizeci. Extrema dreaptă românească'', [[Editura Fundației Culturale Române]], Bucharest, 1995, p.457. {{ISBN|973-9155-43-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist poetry===
Tzara's earliest [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolist poems]], published in ''Simbolul'' during 1912, were later rejected by their author, who asked [[Sașa Pană]] not to include them in editions of his works.&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; The influence of French Symbolists on the young Samyro was particularly important, and surfaced in both his [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Prose poetry|prose poems]].&lt;ref name="mrdada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to Symbolist [[musicality]] at that stage, he was indebted to his ''Simbolul'' colleague [[Ion Minulescu]]&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49; Emil Manu, "Actualitatea lui Ion Minulescu", in [[Ion Minulescu]], ''Versuri și proză'', [[Editura Eminescu]], Bucharest, 1986, p.8. {{OCLC|18090790}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Belgian [[Maurice Maeterlinck]].&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; Philip Beitchman argues that "Tristan Tzara is one of the writers of the twentieth century who was most profoundly influenced by symbolism—and utilized many of its methods and ideas in the pursuit of his own artistic and social ends."&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cernat believes, the young poet was by then already breaking with the [[syntax]] of conventional poetry, and that, in subsequent experimental pieces, he progressively stripped his style of its Symbolist elements.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.49, 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1910s, Samyro experimented with Symbolist imagery, in particular with the "hanged man" motif, which served as the basis for his poem ''Se spânzură un om'' ("A Man Hangs Himself"), and which built on the legacy of similar pieces authored by [[Christian Morgenstern]] and [[Jules Laforgue]].&lt;ref name="pcern52"&gt;Cernat, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; ''Se spânzură un om'' was also in many ways similar to ones authored by his collaborators [[Adrian Maniu]] (''Balada spânzuratului'', "The Hanged Man's Ballad") and Vinea (''Visul spânzuratului'', "The Hanged Man's Dream"): all three poets, who were all in the process of discarding Symbolism, interpreted the theme from a [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] and [[iconoclastic]] perspective.&lt;ref name="pcern52"/&gt; These pieces also include ''Vacanță în provincie'' ("Provincial Holiday") and the [[anti-war]] fragment ''Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului'' ("The Storm and the Deserter's Song"), which Vinea published in his ''Chemarea''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.97-98, 106&lt;/ref&gt; The series is seen by Cernat as "the general rehearsal for the Dada adventure."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; The complete text of ''Furtuna și cântecul dezertorului'' was published at a later stage, after the missing text was discovered by Pană.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he became interested in the [[free verse]] work of the American [[Walt Whitman]], and his translation of Whitman's [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Song of Myself]]'', probably completed before [[World War I]], was published by [[Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]] in his magazine ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

Beitchman notes that, throughout his life, Tzara used Symbolist elements against the doctrines of Symbolism. Thus, he argues, the poet did not cultivate a memory of historical events, "since it deludes man into thinking that there was something when there was nothing."&lt;ref name="pbeit29"&gt;Beitchman, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Cernat notes: "That which essentially unifies, during [the 1910s], the poetic output of Adrian Maniu, Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara is an acute awareness of literary conventions, a satiety [...] in respect to [[Aestheticism|calophile]] literature, which they perceived as exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; In Beitchman's view, the revolt against cultivated beauty was a constant in Tzara's years of maturity, and his visions of social change continued to be inspired by [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and the [[Comte de Lautréamont]].&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.38-39, 46&lt;/ref&gt; According to Beitchman, Tzara uses the Symbolist message, "the birthright [of humans] has been sold for a mess of porridge", taking it "into the streets, cabarets and trains where he denounces the deal and asks for his birthright back."&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration with Vinea===
The transition to a more radical form of poetry seems to have taken place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.117, 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the lyrics were they both speak of provincial holidays and love affairs with local girls, both friends intended to reinterpret [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' from a modernist perspective, and wrote incomplete texts with this as their subject.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.109, 119, 160&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul Cernat notes, the texts also evidence a difference in approach, with Vinea's work being "meditative and melancholic", while Tzara's is "[[Hedonism|hedonistic]]".&lt;ref name="pcern117"&gt;Cernat, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara often appealed to revolutionary and ironic images, portraying provincial and [[middle class]] environments as places of artificiality and decay, demystifying [[pastoral]] themes and evidencing a will to break free.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.117-119&lt;/ref&gt; His literature took a more radical perspective on life, and featured lyrics with subversive intent:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|să ne coborâm în râpa, 
care-i Dumnezeu când cască}}&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.119&lt;/ref&gt;
|
let's descend into the precipice
that is God yawning}}

In his ''Înserează'' (roughly, "Night Falling"), probably authored in [[Mangalia]], Tzara writes:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|[...] deschide-te fereastră, prin urmare
și ieși noapte din odaie ca din piersică sâmburul, 
ca preotul din biserică
[...] hai în parcul communal
până o cânta cocoșul
să se scandalizeze orașul [...].}}&lt;ref name="pcern117"/&gt;
|
[...] open yourself therefore, window
and you night, spring out of the room like a kernel from the peach,
like a priest from the church
[...] let's go to the community park
before the rooster starts crowing
so that the city will be scandalized [...]}}

Vinea's similar poem, written in [[Tuzla, Constanța|Tuzla]] and named after that village, reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|seara bate semne pe far
peste goarnele vagi de apă
când se întorc pescarii cu stele pe mâini
și trec vapoarele și planetele}}&lt;ref name="pcern117"/&gt;
|
the evening stamps signs on the lighthouse
over the vague bugles of water
when fishermen return with stars on their arms
and ships and planets pass by}}

Cernat notes that ''Nocturnă'' ("Nocturne") and ''Înserează'' were the pieces originally performed at [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], identified by [[Hugo Ball]] as "Rumanian poetry",&lt;!-- sic --&gt; and that they were recited in Tzara's own spontaneous French translation.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.111, 120&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are noted for their radical break with the traditional form of Romanian verse,&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dennis Deletant]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2007-01-12&amp;art=3373 "Întoarcerea României în Europa: între politică și cultură"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021120445/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=3373&amp;nr=2007-01-12 |date=21 October 2007 }}, in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 879, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ball's diary entry of 5 February 1916, indicates that Tzara's works were still "conservative in style".&lt;ref name="hrich16"&gt;Richter, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; In Călinescu's view, they announce Dadaism, given that "bypassing the relations which lead to a realistic vision, the poet associates unimaginably dissipated images that will surprise consciousness."&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; In 1922, Tzara himself wrote: "As early as 1914, I tried to strip the words of their proper meaning and use them in such a way as to give the verse a completely new, general, meaning [...]."&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"/&gt;

Alongside pieces depicting a Jewish cemetery in which graves "crawl like worms" on the edge of a town, chestnut trees "heavy-laden like people returning from hospitals", or wind wailing "with all the hopelessness of an orphanage",&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; Samyro's poetry includes ''Verișoară, fată de pension'', which, Cernat argues, displays "playful detachment [for] the musicality of [[internal rhyme]]s".&lt;ref name="pcern49"/&gt; It opens with the lyrics:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Verișoară, fată de pension, îmbrăcată în negru, guler alb,
Te iubesc pentru că ești simplă și visezi
Și ești bună, plângi, și rupi scrisori ce nu au înțeles
Și-ți pare rău că ești departe de ai tăi și că înveți 
La Călugărițe unde noaptea nu e cald.}}&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt;
|
Little cousin, boarding school girl, dressed in black, white collar,
I love you because you are simple and you dream
And you are kind, you cry, you tear up letters that have no meaning
And you feel bad because you are far from yours and you study
At the Nuns where at night it's not warm.}}

The [[Gârceni]] pieces were treasured by the moderate wing of the Romanian avant-garde movement. In contrast to his previous rejection of Dada, ''[[Contimporanul]]'' collaborator [[Benjamin Fondane]] used them as an example of "pure poetry", and compared them to the elaborate writings of French poet [[Paul Valéry]], thus recuperating them in line with the magazine's ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.153, 288; Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.62-67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada synthesis and "simultaneism"===
Tzara the Dadaist was inspired by the contributions of his experimental modernist predecessors. Among them were the literary promoters of [[Cubism]]: in addition to [[Henri Barzun]] and [[Fernand Divoire]], Tzara cherished the works of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, in Richter, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Dada's condemnation of [[Futurism]], various authors note the influence [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and his circle exercised on Tzara's group.&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396; Richter, p.19, 191 (Haftmann, in Richter, p.216-217)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, he was in correspondence with both Apollinaire&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529; Richter, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; and Marinetti.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.529&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Tzara is also seen as indebted to the early avant-garde and [[black comedy]] writings of Romania's [[Urmuz]].&lt;ref name="ddintoarc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.128-129, 341, 343, 346; Amy D. Colin, "Paul Celan's Poetics of Destruction", in Amy D. Colin (ed.), ''Argumentum E Silentio'', [[Walter de Gruyter]], Berlin, 1987, p.158. {{ISBN|3-11-010555-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a large part, Dada focused on performances and [[satire]], with shows that often had Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbeck for their main protagonists. Often dressed up as [[German Tyrol|Tyrolian]] peasants or wearing dark robes, they improvised poetry sessions at the Cabaret Voltaire, reciting the works of others or their spontaneous creations, which were or pretended to be in [[Esperanto]] or [[Māori language]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.113, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Gendron describes these soirées as marked by "heterogeneity and [[eclecticism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; and Richter notes that the songs, often punctuated by loud shrieks or other unsettling sounds, built on the legacy of [[noise music]] and [[Futurism (music)|Futurist compositions]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

With time, Tristan Tzara merged his performances and his literature, taking part in developing Dada's "simultaneist poetry", which was meant to be read out loud and involved a collaborative effort, being, according to [[Hans Arp]], the first instance of [[Surrealist automatism]].&lt;ref name="hrich16"/&gt; Ball stated that the subject of such pieces was "the value of the human voice."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Arp, Tzara and [[Walter Serner]] produced the [[German language|German-language]] ''Die Hyperbel vom Krokodilcoiffeur und dem Spazierstock'' ("The Hyperbole of the Crocodile's Hairdresser and the Walking-Stick"), in which, Arp stated, "the poet crows, curses, sighs, stutters, [[Yodeling|yodels]], as he pleases. His poems are like Nature [where] a tiny particle is as beautiful and important as a star."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Another noted simultaneist poem was ''L'Amiral cherche une maison à louer'' ("The Admiral Is Looking for a House to Rent"), co-authored by Tzara, Marcel Janco and Huelsenbach.&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt;

Art historian Roger Cardinal describes Tristan Tzara's Dada poetry as marked by "extreme semantic and syntactic incoherence".&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; Tzara, who recommended destroying just as it is created,&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396-397&lt;/ref&gt; had devised a personal system for writing poetry, which implied a seemingly chaotic reassembling of words that had been randomly cut out of newspapers.&lt;ref name="nzgysin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.887; Londré, p.397; Richter, p.54, 60, 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rlword"&gt;Robin Lydenberg, ''Word Cultures: Radical Theory and Practice in William S. Burroughs'', [[University of Illinois Press]], Urbana &amp; Chicago, p.45. {{ISBN|0-252-01413-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dada and anti-art===
The Romanian writer also spent the Dada period issuing a long series of manifestos, which were often authored as [[prose poetry]],&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", which reflected "the language of a sophisticated savage".&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for "compress[ing] what we think and feel",&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Hans Richter, the genre "suited Tzara perfectly."&lt;ref name="hrich33"/&gt; Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.33-35&lt;/ref&gt; His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: "Dada means nothing", adding "Thought is produced in the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;Londré, p.396, 397; Richter, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara indicated: "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none."&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt; In addition, Tzara, who once stated that "[[logic]] is always false",&lt;ref name="ipuranus"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf "Un urmuzian: Ionathan X. Uranus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074348/http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna96.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}, in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Vol. V, Nr. 96, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; probably approved of Serner's vision of a "final dissolution".&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.48, 49&lt;/ref&gt; According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that "as long as we do things the way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society."&lt;ref name="pbeit29"/&gt;

Despite adopting such [[anti-art]]istic principles, Richter argues, Tzara, like many of his fellow Dadaists, did not initially discard the mission of "furthening the cause of art."&lt;ref name="Richter, p.54"&gt;Richter, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; He saw this evident in ''La Revue Dada 2'', a poem "as exquisite as freshly-picked flowers", which included the lyrics:
{{Verse translation|

[[File:Guillaume Apollinaire Calligramme.JPG|thumb|190px|One of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]'s [[calligram]]s, shaped like the [[Eiffel Tower]]]]
''La Revue Dada 2'', which also includes the [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] line ''tralalalalalalalalalalala'', is one example where Tzara applies his principles of chance to sounds themselves.&lt;ref name="Richter, p.54"/&gt; This sort of arrangement, treasured by many Dadaists, was probably connected with Apollinaire's [[calligram]]s, and with his announcement that "Man is in search of a new language."&lt;ref name="mlsconcr"&gt;Mary Lewis Shaw, "Concrete and Abstract Poetry: The World as Text and the Text as World", in Leonard M. Trawick (ed.), ''World, Self, Poem: Essays on Contemporary Poetry from the "Jubliation of Poets"'', [[Kent State University Press]], Kent, 1990, p.169. {{ISBN|0-87338-419-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu proposed that Tzara willingly limited the impact of chance: taking as his example a short [[parody]] piece which depicts the love affair between cyclist and a Dadaist, which ends with their decapitation by a jealous husband, the critic notes that Tzara transparently intended to "shock the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]".&lt;ref name="gcal887"/&gt; Late in his career, Huelsenbeck alleged that Tzara never actually applied the experimental methods he had devised.&lt;ref name="hrich123"/&gt;

The Dada series makes ample use of contrast, [[Ellipse (figure of speech)|ellipses]], ridiculous imagery and nonsensical verdicts.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; Tzara was aware that the public could find it difficult to follow his intentions, and, in a piece titled ''Le géant blanc lépreux du paysage'' ("The White Leprous Giant in the Landscape") even alluded to the "skinny, idiotic, dirty" reader who "does not understand my poetry."&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He called some of his own poems ''lampisteries'', from a French word designating storage areas for light fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, p.530; Hofman, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] poet [[Isidore Isou]] included such pieces in a succession of experiments inaugurated by [[Charles Baudelaire]] with the "destruction of the anecdote for the form of the poem", a process which, with Tzara, became "destruction of the word for nothing".&lt;ref name="dwslettr"&gt;David W. Seaman, "French Lettrisme—Discontinuity and the Nature of the Avant-Garde", in Freeman G. Henry (ed.), ''Discontinuity and Fragmentation'', [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]], Amsterdam, 1994, p.163. {{ISBN|90-5183-634-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to American literary historian [[Mary Ann Caws]], Tzara's poems may be seen as having an "internal order", and read as "a simple spectacle, as creation complete in itself and completely obvious."&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;

===Plays of the 1920s===
Tristan Tzara's first play, ''[[The Gas Heart]]'', dates from the final period of Paris Dada. Created with what Enoch Brater calls a "peculiar verbal strategy", it is a dialogue between characters called Ear, Mouth, Eye, Nose, Neck, and Eyebrow.&lt;ref name="ebra25"&gt;Brater, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; They seem unwilling to actually communicate to each other and their reliance on proverbs and idiotisms willingly creates confusion between metaphorical and literal speech.&lt;ref name="ebra25"/&gt; The play ends with a dance performance that recalls similar devices used by the proto-Dadaist [[Alfred Jarry]]. The text culminates in a series of doodles and illegible words.&lt;ref name="ebra26"&gt;Brater, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Brater describes ''The Gas Heart'' as a "parod[y] of theatrical conventions".&lt;ref name="ebra26"/&gt;

In his 1924 play ''[[Handkerchief of Clouds]]'', Tzara explores the relation between perception, the [[subconscious]] and memory. Largely through exchanges between commentators who act as third parties, the text presents the tribulations of a [[love triangle]] (a poet, a bored woman, and her banker husband, whose character traits borrow the clichés of conventional drama), and in part reproduces settings and lines from ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara mocks classical theater, which demands from characters to be inspiring, believable, and to function as a whole: ''Handkerchief of Clouds'' requires actors in the role of commentators to address each other by their real names,&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.32-34; Cernat, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; and their lines include dismissive comments on the play itself, while the [[protagonist]], who in the end dies, is not assigned any name.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.32-34&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Integral'', Tzara defined his play as a note on "the relativity of things, sentiments and events."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.279&lt;/ref&gt; Among the conventions ridiculed by the dramatist, Philip Beitchman notes, is that of a "privileged position for art": in what Beitchman sees as a comment on [[Marxism]], poet and banker are interchangeable [[Capitalism|capitalists]] who invest in different fields.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1925, Fondane rendered a pronouncement by [[Jean Cocteau]], who, while commenting that Tzara was one of his "most beloved" writers and a "great poet", argued: "''Handkerchief of Clouds'' was poetry, and great poetry for that matter—but not theater."&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; The work was nonetheless praised by [[Ion Călugăru]] at ''Integral'', who saw in it one example that modernist performance could rely not just on props, but also on a solid text.&lt;ref name="pcern277"/&gt;

===''The Approximate Man'' and later works===
After 1929, with the adoption of Surrealism, Tzara's literary works discard much of their satirical purpose, and begin to explore universal themes relating to the [[human condition]].&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; According to Cardinal, the period also signified the definitive move from "a studied inconsequentiality" and "unreadable gibberish" to "a seductive and fertile surrealist idiom."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; The critic also remarks: "Tzara arrived at a mature style of transparent simplicity, in which disparate entities could be held together in a unifying vision."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; In a 1930 essay, Fondane had given a similar verdict: arguing that Tzara had infused his work with "suffering", had discovered humanity, and had become a "[[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]" among poets.&lt;ref&gt;Răileanu &amp; Carassou, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

This period in Tzara's creative activity centers on ''[[The Approximate Man]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] which is reportedly recognized as his most accomplished contribution to [[French literature]].&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; While maintaining some of Tzara's preoccupation with language experimentation, it is mainly a study in [[social alienation]] and the search for an escape.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.37-42&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal calls the piece "an extended meditation on mental and elemental impulses [...] with images of stunning beauty",&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; while Breitchman, who notes Tzara's rebellion against the "excess baggage of [man's] past and the notions [...] with which he has hitherto tried to control his life", remarks his portrayal of poets as voices who can prevent human beings from destroying themselves with their own intellects.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.37-38&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is a new man who lets intuition and spontaneity guide him through life, and who rejects measure.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.40-45&lt;/ref&gt; One of the appeals in the text reads:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|je parle de qui parle qui parle je suis seul
je ne suis qu'un petit bruit j'ai plusieurs bruits en moi
un bruit glacé froissé au carrefour jeté sur le trottoir humide
aux pieds des hommes pressés courant avec leurs morts
autour de la mort qui étend ses bras
sur le cadran de l'heure seule vivante au soleil.}}&lt;ref name="jycmelusine"/&gt;
|
I speak of the one who speaks who speaks I am alone
I am but a small noise I have several noises in me
a ruffled noise frozen with the crossroads thrown on the wet pavement
with the feet of the men in a hurry running with their dead
around death which extends its arms
on the dial of the hour only alive in the sun}}

The next stage in Tzara's career saw a merger of his literary and political views. His poems of the period blend a [[Humanism|humanist]] vision with [[Communism|communist]] theses.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pbeit49"/&gt; The 1935 ''Grains et issues'', described by Beitchman as "fascinating",&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; was a prose poem of [[social criticism]] connected with ''The Approximate Man'', expanding on the vision of a possible society, in which haste has been abandoned in favor of [[oblivion (eternal)|oblivion]]. The world imagined by Tzara abandons symbols of the past, from literature to public transportation and currency, while, like psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], the poet depicts violence as a natural means of human expression.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.46-50&lt;/ref&gt; People of the future live in a state which combines waking life and the realm of dreams, and life itself turns into revery.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grains et issues'' was accompanied by ''Personage d'insomnie'' ("Personage of Insomnia"), which went unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal notes: "In retrospect, harmony and contact had been Tzara's goals all along."&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; The post-[[World War II]] volumes in the series focus on political subjects related to the conflict.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; In his last writings, Tzara toned down experimentation, exercising more control over the lyrical aspects.&lt;ref name="enotestt"/&gt; He was by then undertaking a [[Hermeneutics|hermeutic]] research into the work of [[Goliard]]s and [[François Villon]], whom he deeply admired.&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mrnnradi"/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Influence===
Beside the many authors who were attracted into Dada through his promotional activities, Tzara was able to influence successive generations of writers. This was the case in his homeland during 1928, when the first avant-garde manifesto issued by ''[[unu]]''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; magazine, written by [[Sașa Pană]] and [[Moldov]], cited as its mentors Tzara, writers Breton, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Vinea, [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and [[Tudor Arghezi]], as well as artists [[Constantin Brâncuși]] and [[Theo van Doesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.889&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Romanian writers to claim inspiration from Tzara was [[Jacques G. Costin]], who nevertheless offered an equally good reception to both Dadaism and [[Futurism]],&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.174, 193, 409&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ilarie Voronca]]'s ''Zodiac'' cycle, first published in France, is traditionally seen as indebted to ''The Approximate Man''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.328&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] and Surrealist author [[Mihail (Marcel) Avramescu|Marcel Avramescu]], who wrote during the 1930s, also appears to have been directly inspired by Tzara's views on art.&lt;ref name="ipuranus"/&gt; Other authors from that generation to have been inspired by Tzara were [[Poland|Polish]] Futurist writer [[Bruno Jasieński]],&lt;ref&gt;Nina Kolesnikoff, ''Bruno Jasieński: His Evolution from Futurism to Socialist Realism'', [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]], Waterloo, 1982, p.15. {{ISBN|0-88920-110-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]]ese poet and [[Zen]] thinker [[Takahashi Shinkichi]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Makoto Ueda (poetry critic)|Makoto Ueda]], ''Modern Japanese Poets and the Nature of Literature'', [[Stanford University Press]], Palo Alto, 1983, p.335-336. {{ISBN|0-8047-1166-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chile]]an poet and Dadaist sympathizer [[Vicente Huidobro]], who cited him as a precursor for his own ''[[Creacionismo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [[Vicente Huidobro]], [http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/manifiesto1.htm ''El Creacionismo''], at the [[University of Chile]] [http://www.vicentehuidobro.uchile.cl/ Vicente Huidobro site]; retrieved 4 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

An immediate precursor of [[Theater of the Absurd|Absurdism]], he was acknowledged as a mentor by [[Eugène Ionesco]], who developed on his principles for his early essays of literary and social criticism, as well as in tragic farces such as ''[[The Bald Soprano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosette C. Lamont, ''Ionesco's Imperatives: The Politics of Culture'', [[University of Michigan Press]], Ann Arbor, 1993, p.4. {{ISBN|0-472-10310-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's poetry influenced [[Samuel Beckett]] (who translated some of it into English);&lt;ref name="dbgodot"/&gt; the Irish author's 1972 play ''[[Not I]]'' shares some elements with ''[[The Gas Heart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brater, p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Romanian author is cited as an influence on [[Beat Generation]] members. Beat writer [[Allen Ginsberg]], who made his acquaintance in Paris, cites him among the Europeans who influenced him and [[William S. Burroughs]].&lt;ref&gt;Josef Jařab, "When All Met Together in One Room: Josef Jařab Interviews Allen Ginsberg", in Heather Hathaway, Josef Jařab, Jeffrey Melnick (eds.), ''Race and the Modern Artist'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York, p.242-243. {{ISBN|0-19-512324-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter also mentioned Tzara's use of chance in writing poetry as an early example of what became the [[cut-up technique]], adopted by [[Brion Gysin]] and Burroughs himself.&lt;ref name="rlword"/&gt; Gysin, who conversed with Tzara in the late 1950s, records the latter's indignation that Beat poets were "going back over the ground we [Dadaists] covered in 1920", and accuses Tzara of having consumed his creative energies into becoming a "Communist Party bureaucrat".&lt;ref name="nzgysin"/&gt;

Among the late 20th-century writers who acknowledged Tzara as an inspiration are [[Jerome Rothenberg]],&lt;ref name="camroth"&gt;Christine A. Meilick, ''Jerome Rothenberg's Experimental Poetry and Jewish Tradition'', [[Lehigh University Press]], Bethlehem, 2005, p.46-47, 85sqq. {{ISBN|0-934223-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore Isou]] and [[Andrei Codrescu]]. The former [[Situationist International|Situationist]] Isou, whose experiments with sounds and poetry come in succession to Apollinaire and Dada,&lt;ref name="mlsconcr"/&gt; declared his [[Lettrism]] to be the last connection in the [[Charles Baudelaire]]-Tzara cycle, with the goal of arranging "a nothing [...] for the creation of the anecdote."&lt;ref name="dwslettr"/&gt; For a short period, Codrescu even adopted the pen name ''Tristan Tzara''.&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noemi Marin, "The Rhetoric of Andrei Codrescu: A Reading in Exilic Fragmentation", in Domnica Rădulescu (ed.), ''Realms of Exile: Nomadism, Diasporas, and Eastern European Voices'', Lexington Books, New York, p.102. {{ISBN|0-7391-0333-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled the impact of having discovered Tzara's work in his youth, and credited him with being "the most important French poet after Rimbaud."&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"/&gt;

In retrospect, various authors describe Tzara's Dadaist shows and street performances as "[[happening]]s", with a word employed by post-Dadaists and Situationists, which was coined in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.44; Londré, p.397&lt;/ref&gt; Some also credit Tzara with having provided an ideological source for the development of [[rock music]], including [[punk rock]], [[punk subculture]] and [[post-punk]].&lt;ref name="amcodrescu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beitchman, p.36; Thomas McLaughlin, ''Street Smarts and Critical Theory: Listening to the Vernacular'', [[University of Wisconsin Press]], Madison, 1997, p.67. {{ISBN|0-299-15170-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tristan Tzara has inspired the songwriting technique of [[Radiohead]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Tate, ''The Music and Art of Radiohead'', [[Ashgate Publishing]], London etc., 2005, p.195. {{ISBN|0-7546-3980-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the avant-garde authors whose voices were mixed by [[DJ Spooky]] on his [[trip hop]] album ''Rhythm Science''.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Buttimer, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/jx8c/ "DJ Spooky.

===Tributes and portrayals===
[[File:Tzara by Tihanyi.jpg|thumb|210px|1927, Portrait of Tzara by [[Lajos Tihanyi]]]]
In France, Tzara's work was collected as ''Oeuvres complètes'' ("Complete Works"), of which the first volume saw print in 1975,&lt;ref name="rcard530"/&gt; and an international poetry award is named after him (''Prix International de Poésie Tristan Tzara'').

According to Paul Cernat, ''Aliluia'', one of the few avant-garde texts authored by Ion Vinea features a "transparent allusion" to Tristan Tzara.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; Vinea's fragment speaks of "the [[Wandering Jew]]", a character whom people notice because he sings ''La moară la Hârța'', "a suspicious song from [[Greater Romania]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.181-182&lt;/ref&gt; The poet is a character in [[India]]n novelist [[Mulk Raj Anand]]'s ''Thieves of Fire'', part four of his ''The Bubble'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;Suresh Chandra, ''Fresh Perspectives on Fiction'', Anmol Publications, New Delhi, 2005, p.78. {{ISBN|81-261-2126-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''The Prince of West End Avenue'', a 1994 book by the American [[Alan Isler]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bette Pesetsky]], "Shakespeare Meets Emma Lazarus", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 29 May 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberg dedicated several of his poems to Tzara,&lt;ref name="camroth"/&gt; as did the [[Neo-Dada]]ist [[Valery Oișteanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Valery Oișteanu]], [http://www.respiro.org/Issue10/poezie_oisteanu.htm "Poeme din exil"] in [http://www.respiro.org/ ''Respiro''], Issue 10/2002&lt;/ref&gt; Tzara's legacy in literature also covers specific episodes of his biography, beginning with [[Gertrude Stein]]'s controversial memoir.

Alongside his collaborations with Dada artists on various pieces, Tzara himself was a subject for visual artists. [[Max Ernst]] depicts him as the only mobile character in the Dadaists' group portrait ''Au Rendez-vous des Amis'' ("A Friends' Reunion", 1922),&lt;ref name="spbuot"/&gt; while, in one of [[Man Ray]]'s photographs, he is shown kneeling to kiss the hand of an [[androgynous]] [[Nancy Cunard]].&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Moynagh, introduction to [[Nancy Cunard]], ''Essays on Race and Empire'', Broadview Press, Peterborough &amp; Orchard Park, p.24. {{ISBN|1-55111-230-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years before their split, [[Francis Picabia]] used Tzara's [[Calligraphy|calligraphed]] name in ''Moléculaire'' ("Molecular"), a composition printed on the cover of ''[[391 (magazine)|391]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; The same artist also completed his schematic portrait, which showed a series of circles connected by two perpendicular arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist [[Alberto Giacometti]] made Tzara the subject of one of his first experiments with [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bnf.fr/PAGES/presse/dossiers/giacometti.pdf ''Dossier de presse.

===Posthumous controversies===
The many polemics which surrounded Tzara in his lifetime left traces after his death, and determine contemporary perceptions of his work. The controversy regarding Tzara's role as a founder of Dada extended into several milieus, and continued long after the writer died. Richter, who discusses the lengthy conflict between Huelsenbeck and Tzara over the issue of Dada foundation, speaks of the movement as being torn apart by "petty jealousies".&lt;ref name="hrich32"/&gt; In Romania, similar debates often involved the supposed founding role of [[Urmuz]], who wrote his avant-garde texts before [[World War I]], and Tzara's status as a communicator between Romania and the rest of Europe. Vinea, who claimed that Dada had been invented by Tzara in [[Gârceni]] ca. 1915 and thus sought to legitimize his own modernist vision, also saw Urmuz as the ignored precursor of radical modernism, from Dada to Surrealism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.121-122, 128-129, 177, 212, 343, 346, 359, 409&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 the young, modernist literary critic [[Lucian Boz]] evidenced that he partly shared Vinea's perspective on the matter, crediting Tzara and [[Constantin Brâncuși]] with having, each on his own, invented the avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.331&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugène Ionesco]] argued that "before Dadaism there was Urmuzianism", and, after [[World War II]], sought to popularize Urmuz's work among aficionados of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.367&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors in the literary community had it that Tzara successfully sabotaged Ionesco's initiative to publish a French edition of Urmuz's texts, allegedly because the public could then question his claim to have initiated the avant-garde experiment in Romania and the world (the edition saw print in 1965, two years after Tzara's death).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.110, 367-368&lt;/ref&gt;

A more radical questioning of Tzara's influence came from Romanian essayist [[Petre Pandrea]]. In his personal diary, published long after he and Tzara had died, Pandrea depicted the poet as an opportunist, accusing him of adapting his style to political requirements, of dodging military service during [[World War I]], and of being a "[[Lumpenproletariat|Lumpenproletarian]]".&lt;ref name="pcern113"&gt;Cernat, p.113&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea's text, completed just after Tzara's visit to Romania, claimed that his founding role within the avant-garde was an "illusion [...] which has swelled up like a multicolored balloon", and denounced him as "the [[Balkans|Balkan]] provider of interlope [[odalisque]]s, [together] with narcotics and a sort of scandalous literature."&lt;ref name="pcern113"/&gt; Himself an adherent to communism, Pandrea grew disillusioned with the ideology, and later became a [[political prisoner]] in [[Communist Romania]]. Vinea's own grudge probably shows up in his 1964 novel ''Lunatecii'', where Tzara is identifiable as "Dr. Barbu", a thick-hided charlatan.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Sanda Cordoș, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Lunatecii-un-mare-roman-de-redescoperit*articleID_28954-articles_details.html "''Lunatecii'' – un mare roman de redescoperit"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 683, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s to 1989, after a period when it ignored or attacked the avant-garde movement, the Romanian communist regime sought to recuperate Tzara, in order to validate its newly adopted emphasis on nationalist and [[National communism|national communist]] tenets. In 1977, literary historian [[Edgar Papu]], whose controversial theories were linked to "[[protochronism]]", which presumes that Romanians took precedence in various areas of world culture, mentioned Tzara, Urmuz, Ionesco and Isou as representatives of "Romanian initiatives" and "road openers at a universal level."&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.359&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of protochronism in this area, Paul Cernat argues, could be traced back to Vinea's claim that his friend had single-handedly created the worldwide avant-garde movement on the basis of models already present at home.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tuileagna Ó Maol Chonaire''' (''[[Floruit|fl.]]'' 1637) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[historian]].

==Background==

Tuileagna was a member of the [[Ó Maolconaire]] [[Brehon]] family, but it has proved difficult for researchers to uncover more detail about him. His antagonist, [[Fearfeasa Ó Maol Chonaire]], said in a poem that his father's name was Seanchán. He might be identified with the Tuileagna Ó Maol Chonaire who was a student at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Louvain]] in 1625, or a student at the Irish College at [[Salamanca]] in April 1610, who was aged about twenty-five.

He is usually  thought to have been the Tuileagna Ó Maol Chonaire recorded living in [[Madrid]] some years later. In March 1658, a man of that name authenticated a genealogical transcript, identifying himself as ''seancha coitcheann Éireann''/''general historian of Ireland.'' In September 1659, the same man transcribed a [[tract (literature)|tract]] on [[grammar]] and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] for Father [[Patrick Tyrrell]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]], indicating that the man in Madrid had links with the Irish Franciscans, perhaps himself being a member of the order.

A later Tuileagna Ó Maol Chonaire added a note to Laud Misc 610 in [[Oxford]], 1673, but his identity is unknown. An earlier [[Tuileagna Ó Maoil Chonaire]], was a [[poet]] alive about 1585.

==Dispute with the Four Masters==
In 1637, upon [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]]'s return to [[Leuven|Louvain]] with the finished [[autograph]] of the [[Annals of the Four Masters]], Tuileagna publicly expressed concerns on four points of detail in ''Genalogiae regum et sanctorum Hiberniae'' and the Four Masters text, stating that the points cast a slur on the status of [[Connacht]]. He furthermore stated that [[Conchobhar Mac Bruaideadha]] withdrew his [[approbation]] in public following a general chapter of the Franciscans in [[Thomond]] in 1638, while stating that [[Flan Mac Aodhagáin]] had temporarily withdrawn his approbation in 1637 until the disputed points were resolved.

Discussion of the matter continued after Ó Cléirigh's death in 1643, and in part led to the delay in publication of the work.

Two of the Masters, [[Cú Choigcríche Ó Cléirigh]] and [[Fearfeasa Ó Maol Chonaire]], wrote responses in prose and verse to Tuileagna, though that of Cú Choigcríche has not survived.

Bernadette Cunningham has noted "That the Tuileagna Ó Maol Chonaire who criticized Ó Cléirigh's work was a Franciscan would have made it relatively easy for him to have the matter of the accuracy of AFM and associated texts raised at no less than three formal [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]] of the order - at Thomond (1638), [[Multyfarnham]] (1641) and Dublin." (p.&amp;nbsp;266) She furthermore states:

{{quote|"His citation of manuscripts in his criticism ... is of interest. He claimed to have judged the work against authoritative sources including ''Leabhar Chluana mac Nóis'', ''Leabhar Chluana hEidhneach'', ''[[Great Book of Lecan|Leabhar Leacain]]'', ''Leabhar Chluana Plocáin'' ... a list not dissimilar to the authorities used by the Four Masters themselves ... It is unlikely, though not impossible, that he had many of these manuscripts to hand at the same time as he had access to the text of AFM, but Tuileagna nonetheless felt confident about their contents. At the very least, he must have moved in circles where he could claim to be familiar with such important manususcripts. It is mostly likely to have been when Ó Cléirigh was in Dublin in February 1637, obtaining the final approbations for his work from the [[archbishop]], [[Thomas Fleming (archbishop)|Thomas Fleming]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]], and preparing to leave Ireland, that Tuileagna Ó Maol Chonaire availed of the opportunity to examine the work. It is noteworthy that Tuileagna also had access to the work of another Franciscan historian, [[Fláithrí Ó Maol Chonaire]], together with the recently completed ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]'' of [[Geoffrey Keating]] ... He also claimed to be the recipient of a letter from Flann Mac Aodhagáin withdrawing his approbation."}}(p.&amp;nbsp;266)

Tuileagna did not offer to revise the text himself, instead proposing that the Reverend [[Brian Flann Mac Aodhagáin]] and others assess it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Publication delay==

Tuileagna's views held enough influence within the Irish Franciscan community to delay publication. While manuscripts of the Annals circulated for generations, it was only in 1846 that a version translated into English was published by [[Owen Connellan]], and only as far as 1171. [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] edited the six volumes that comprised the full text published in the 1850s.

The '''War of Ideas''' is a clash of opposing ideals, [[ideologies]], or concepts through which nations or groups use strategic influence to promote their interests abroad. The "battle space" of this conflict is the target population's "[[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]]", while the "weapons" can include, inter alia, [[think tanks]], TV programs, newspaper articles, the internet, blogs, official government policy papers, traditional as well as [[public diplomacy]], or radio broadcasts.

They are, indeed, genuine wars, even though the physical violence might be minimal, because they serve a political, socio-cultural, or economic purpose, and they involve hostile intentions or hostile acts. Wars of ideas can assume many forms, but they tend to fall into four general categories (though these are not necessarily exhaustive): (a) intellectual debates, (b) ideological wars, (c) wars over religious dogma, and (d) advertising campaigns. All of them are essentially about power and influence, just as with wars over territory and material resources, and their stakes can run very high indeed|Echevarria 2008 ''Wars of Ideas and the War of Ideas''|Strategic Studies Institute of the US Army War College (SSI)}}.

==History of the concept==

{{quote|''On résiste à l'invasion des armées; on ne résiste pas à l'invasion des idées.'' 

One resists the invasion of armies; one does not resist the invasion of ideas.|Victor Marie Hugo (1802 – 1885)| Histoire d'un Crime (The History of a Crime)|written 1852, published 1877 |Conclusion, ch. X. Trans. T.H. Joyce and Arthur Locker}}

{{quote|The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.|John Maynard Keynes |''The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money''|1936), chapter xxiv}}

[[Richard M. Weaver]] published ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' in 1948 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. The book is largely a treatise on the harmful effects of [[nominalism]] on [[Western civilization]] since that doctrine gained prominence in the [[High Middle Ages]], followed by a prescription of a course of action through which Weaver believes the West might be rescued from its decline. Weaver attributes the beginning of the Western decline to the adoption of nominalism (or the rejection of the notion of [[absolute truth]]) in the late [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] period.

In 1993, Heritage Foundation analyst James A. Phillips used the term "war of ideas" in describing the pivotal role played by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] (NED) in the ideological battle for the protection of democracy. Phillips defended the NED as "an important weapon in the war of ideas," &lt;ref name=NED1993&gt;{{cite report |author=James A. Phillips |title=The National Endowment for Democracy: An Important Weapon in the War of Ideas |series=Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum |publisher=Heritage Foundation |number=360 |date=July 8, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; against communist dictatorships in control of China, Cuba, North Korea, and Vietnam. In a [[Cato Institute]] Foreign Policy brief, it was argued that there was no longer a need for the NED because "the democratic West has won the war of ideas against its communist adversaries." &lt;ref name=NED1993/&gt;

Hence, physical events, whether intended or incidental, typically play determining roles in the ways wars of ideas unfold, and how (or whether) they are end.

&lt;/ref&gt; commemorating the 10th anniversary of 9/11, a round table was held bringing together [[Paul Berman]], Scott Malcomson, [[James Traub]], [[David Rieff]], [[Ian Burama]] and [[Michael Ignatieff]]. Malcomson observed, 

{{quote|The American reaction to being attacked on September 11 was in many ways an intellectual one. President [[George W. Bush]] tended to frame it that way: the attack was on our "values," and the "war against terror" was a war of ideas meant to advance the idea of freedom|Scott Malcomson. ''A Decade of War.'' 2011-09-11:38).&lt;ref name=decadewar /&gt;}}

{{quote|Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was the administration's epistemologist, worrying over the question of knowability; Bernard Lewis was its historian, Paul Wolfowitz its moralist in arms. That America's actions (as opposed to precautions) after 9/11 almost all took place far from home, with a professional army, strengthened this sense of abstraction. The possibility of anything like victory over our enemies was discounted early on (by Rumsfeld). Little wonder that, unlike in earlier wars, we have talked so much about what this conflict means, rather than simply working to end it as soon as possible|Scott Malcomson|September 7, 2011|''New York Times Magazine''}}

==Intellectual debates as wars of ideas==
Intellectual debates spiral into wars of ideas when academic concepts of neutrality and objectivity are abandoned and issues devolve into embittered and divisive disputes. Echevarria argued (2008) that in the United States topics such as [[abortion]], "[[intelligent design]]" and [[evolution]] are wars of ideas.&lt;ref name=Echevarriawarsideas /&gt; When an intellectual debate devolves into a war of ideas

{{quote|... [o]pposing sides seldom change their positions based on the introduction of new evidence, or new ways of evaluating existing evidence. Thus, wars of ideas are rarely settled on the merits of the ideas themselves. Instead, they tend to drag on, unless an event occurs that causes the belligerents to focus their attention elsewhere (Echevarria).|Strategic Studies Institute of the US Army War College (SSI)}}

Echarria uses &lt;ref name=Echevarriawarsideas /&gt; Kuhn's controversial incommensurability thesis &lt;ref name=Kuhn1962&gt;{{cite book |year=1962 |title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a claim to relativism and therefore a defense of engagement in the war of ideas. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] (1922–1996) who is one of the most influential twentieth century philosophers of science published ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962) one of the most cited publications, in which he developed the thesis of incommensurability thesis, where he argued that "theories from differing periods suffer from certain deep kinds of failure of comparability" In &lt;ref name=Kuhn1962&gt;{{cite book |year=1962 |title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The central idea is that the development of science is driven by adherence to paradigms. If a particular paradigm cannot solve an anomaly, a crisis in science may result. An existing paradigm may be superseded by a rival paradigm. There may be no common measure for assessing the competing scientific theories. They are 'incommensurable'.&lt;ref name=SEPKuhn&gt;{{cite web |title=Thomas Kuhn |author=Alexander Bird |year=2011 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of [[paradigm shift]]s and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for [[relativism]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sankey, Howard (1997) "Kuhn's ontological relativism," in ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', edited by Dimitri Ginev and Robert S. Cohen. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1997. Boston studies in the philosophy of science, vol. 192, pp. 305-320. {{ISBN|0792344448}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal.  Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is ''always better'', not just different.

These claims of [[relativism]] are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another &amp;mdash; that they are ''incommensurable''. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes &amp;mdash; so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the [[philosopher]] [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] published a highly regarded essay in 1974, "On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme" (''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 47, (1973-1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;5–20) arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.  Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on [[social science]] has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, ''Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity''. Cambridge University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0521350344}}.)

==In U.S. politics==

According to political scientist [[Andrew Rich]], author of ''Think Tanks, Public Policy, and the Politics of Expertise '' &lt;ref name=thinktanks&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |author=Andrew Rich |title=Think Tanks, Public Policy, and the Politics of Expertise}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "war of ideas" is "fundamentally a battle between liberals and conservatives, progressives and libertarians, over the appropriate role for government."&lt;ref name=Rich2005&gt;

[[Thomas E. Mann]] and [[Norm Ornstein]] claim that the dysfunctionality of American politics is worse than it has ever been. "The partisan and ideological polarization from which we now suffer comes at a time when critical problems cry out for resolution, making for a particularly toxic mix."&lt;ref name=MannOrnstein&gt;{{cite web

{{quote|The extreme and asymmetric partisan polarization that has evolved over several decades, initially reflecting increasing ideological differences but then extending well beyond issues that ordinarily divide the parties to advance strategic electoral interests, fits uneasily with a set of governing institutions that puts up substantial barriers to majority rule. To improve that fit—either by producing less polarized combatants or by making political institutions and practices more responsive to parliamentary-like parties—we as a people need to think about ambitious reforms of electoral rules and governing arrangements. The former can include, for example, focusing more on the demand side of campaign finance than on the supply side. |Thomas E. Mann and Norm Ornstein (2012)}}

This makes it difficult for leaders to "lead and govern effectively". Those outside of government, such as "individuals, advocacy groups, businesses, and the news media" must recognize how "their own behaviors hinder leadership and make it difficult for elected and administrative officials to bargain and negotiate." Policy-making today is "plagued by extreme partisan polarization". News coverage does not inform civic discussions. There is a lack of political civility.

==In US foreign policy==

There are two principal schools of thought on how to approach the war of ideas. The first approach advocates treating the conflict as a matter best addressed through [[public diplomacy]]—defined as the conveyance of information across a broad spectrum to include cultural affairs and political action. Accordingly, this view calls for revitalizing or transforming the [[U.S. Department of State]] and many of the traditional tools of [[Public relations|statecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=866 Dr. Antulio J. Echevarria, WARS OF IDEAS AND THE WAR OF IDEAS], p.26&lt;/ref&gt;  This school of thought contends that American public diplomacy declined after the Cold War, as evidenced by the demise of the [[U.S. Information Agency]] in 1999, and the reduction or elimination of [[Strategic Communication|strategic communications]] programs such as "[[Voice of America]]," and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. The remedy, then, according to this view, is to re-engage the world, especially the Arab-Muslim world, by revitalizing both the form and content of U.S. public diplomacy and strategic communications, and by reinforcing those communications with concrete programs that invest in people, create opportunities for positive exchanges, and help build friendships. In fact, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and its Iraqi component, [[Radio Free Iraq]], and [[Al-Hurra]] TV are now actively participating in U.S. strategic communication efforts, though with debatable effectiveness; all this has occurred, in part, by taking resources from Voice of America.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Curtis, "Efforts to Deal with America's Image Abroad: Are They Working?" Testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight, April 26, 2007, p. 6.[http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/35034.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In direct contrast, the second school of thought advocates treating the war of ideas as a "real war," wherein the objective is to destroy the influence and credibility of the opposing ideology, to include neutralizing its chief proponents. This approach sees [[public diplomacy]] as an essential, but insufficient tool because it requires too much time to achieve desired results, and does little to aid the immediate efforts of combat forces in the field. For this school of thought, the principal focus of the war of ideas ought to be how to use the ways and means of [[information warfare]] to eliminate terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;Walid Phares, "The War of Ideas: Jihadism against Democracy,"(New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007); Waller, "Fighting the War of Ideas"; Zeyno Baran, "Fighting the War of Ideas," Foreign Affairs,Vol. 84, No. 6, November/December 2005, pp. 68–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use during the Cold War==
[[File:Chile quema libros 1973.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Book burnings in Chile]] following the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 coup]] that installed the [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|Pinochet regime]]. Note the painting with a [[Che Guevara]] portrait being burned.]]
According to Dr. John Lenczowski, former Director of European and Soviet Affairs for the National Security Council during the Reagan administration, 'The Cold War took many forms, including proxy wars, the arms race, nuclear blackmail, economic warfare, subversion, covert operations and the battle for men's minds.  While many of these forms had the trappings of traditional conflicts of national interests, there was a dimension to the Cold War that made it unique among wars: it centered around a war of ideas—a war between two alternative political philosophies.''&lt;ref&gt;Dr. John Lenczowski,[http://www.phillysoc.org/lenctex.htm ''Emboldening Domestic Resistance to Communism: Presidential Rhetoric and the War of Information and Ideas Against the Soviet Union'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the United States and other Western powers developed a robust infrastructure for waging a ''war of ideas'' against the [[communist]] ideology being promulgated by the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies. During the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, the so-called golden age of U.S. propaganda, counterpropaganda, and public diplomacy operations, the U.S. government carried out a sophisticated program of overt and covert activities designed to shape public opinion behind the [[Iron Curtain]], within European intellectual and cultural circles, and across the developing world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1131"&gt;William Rosenau,[http://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/2006/RAND_RP1218.pdf The RAND Corporation, “Waging the “war of Ideas,”](The McGraw-Hill Homeland Security Handbook, Chapter 72, pp. 1131–1148, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The United States was able to reach as much as 50–70% of the populations behind the Iron Curtain during the 1950s through their international broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Gough,[http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/gough.pdf ‘‘The Evolution of Strategic Influence,’’] USAWC [U.S. Army War College] Strategy Research Project, Carlisle Barracks, Pa. (April 7, 2004), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; High-level interest in such operations waned during the 1970s, but received renewed emphasis under President Ronald Reagan, the ''Great Communicator,'' who, like Eisenhower, was a firm advocate of the informational component of America's Cold War strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Gough,[http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/gough.pdf ‘‘The Evolution of Strategic Influence,’’PP.20–24]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the end of the Cold War official interest once again plummeted. During the 1990s, Congress and the executive branch disparaged informational activities as costly Cold War anachronisms. The budget for State Department informational programs was slashed, and [[USIA]], a quasi-independent body that reported to the secretary of state, was disestablished, and its responsibilities were transferred to a new undersecretary of state for public diplomacy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1131"/&gt;

==Use in the War on Terror==

Terrorism is a form of political and psychological warfare; it is protracted, high-intensity propaganda, aimed more at the hearts of the public and the minds of decision makers, and not at the physical victims.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Waller, Fighting the War of Ideas like a Real War (The Institute of World Politics Press,2007), p.20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; There is growing recognition among U.S. government officials, journalists, and analysts of terrorism that defeating al-Qaida— arguably the preeminent challenge to U.S. security—will require far more than ''neutralizing'' leaders, disrupting cells, and dismantling networks.&lt;ref&gt;William Rosenau,[http://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/2006/RAND_RP1218.pdf The RAND Corporation, “Waging the “war of Ideas,”] (The McGraw-Hill Homeland Security Handbook, Chapter 72, pp. 1131–1148, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[9/11 Commission]] concluded in its final report, eliminating al-Qaida as a formidable danger ultimately requires ''prevailing in the longer term over the ideology that gives rise to Islamist terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States,[http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf The 9/11 Commission Report] (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2004), p. 363.
&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Akbar Ahmed]], a Muslim scholar who holds the Chair of Islamic Studies at American University, explains: Properly understood, this is a war of ideas within Islam—some of them faithful to authentic Islam, but some of them clearly un-Islamic and even blasphemous toward the peaceful and compassionate Allah of the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Waller, Fighting the War of Ideas like a Real War,  Washington, DC: The Institute of World Politics Press, 2007, p. 68. [http://jmw.typepad.com/political_warfare/files/War_of_Ideas_Waller.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans, in general, are fundamentally opposed waging what seems as a blatantly ideological struggle seems quite unnatural to Americans and other Westerners, who tend to downplay intangible factors such as ideas, history, and culture as political motivators, preferring instead to stress relatively more concrete driving forces such as personal security and physical well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Carnes Lord, ''The Psychological Dimension in National Strategy,'' in Frank R. Barnett and Carnes Lord (eds.), Political Warfare and Psychological Operations(Washington, D.C.: National Defense University Press, 1989): 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States military has recently begun incorporating a strategic communication into their overall battle operations in the [[War on Terror]], especially in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].  In addition to the military's traditional role of using force they are beginning to use political as well as [[ideological]] warfare against the enemy as a method of influencing the local populations into opposing say the [[Taliban]] or [[al Qa'ida]]. The ancient Chinese philosopher [[Sun Tzu]] once said that to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Tzu, Art of War, http://suntzusaid.com/book/3&lt;/ref&gt; The War of Ideas attempts to  "break the enemy's resistance."

==Terrorists' use of mass media==

Users of terror tactics' strategic communications goals are aimed at legitimizing, propagating, and intimidating their audience. Their skilful use of the mass media and the internet has enabled them to keep generating new generations of followers.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Carsten Bockstette, "Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques" http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaida's message, disseminated widely and effectively through all forms of mass media, including the Internet, has a powerful appeal in much of the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous [Michael Scheuer], Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror (Washington: Brassey's, 2004), pp. 209–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an al-Qaeda spokesman described Osama bin Laden's strategic [[influence of mass media]] in the Arab world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sheikh Usama knows that the media war is not less important than the military war against America. That's why al-Qaeda has many media wars. The Sheikh has made al-Qaeda's media strategy something that all TV stations look for. There are certain criteria for the stations to be able to air our videos, foremost of which is that it has not taken a previous stand against the mujahedeen. That maybe explains why we prefer Al-Jazeera to the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Gendron,[http://www.itac-ciem.gc.ca/pblctns/tc_prsnts/2007-2-eng.asp Trends in Terrorism Series: Al-Qaeda: Propaganda and Media Strategy](2007) ITAC Presents Vol. 2007-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Media and the internet enable terrorists to thrive in a cancerous manner in the freedom that democracies provide. The intensive, sometimes obsessive coverage in the media about a terrorist act generates the desired psychological effect. Terrorist actions are planned and organized in a manner that causes a strategically maximum communicative effect, while requiring minimal resources. The symbiotic relationship between terror events and the media is apparent: the perpetrators would have far less impact without media publicity and the media can hardly be expected to resist reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Elihu &amp; Liebes, Tamar, "'No More Peace!' How Disaster, Terror and War have Upstaged Media Events." International Journal of Communication (2007), 157–166.http://ijoc.org/ojs/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/44/23&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite TV and the internet offers terrorists expanded possibilities of influencing and manipulating audiences.

==Terrorist media publication companies==

Terrorist groups are utilizing mass media, particularly the internet, to win the "War of Ideas" because their inability to win a traditional head-to-head war against a military force.

==Methods==

For instance in the West's battle against jihadist terrorists:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ensuring one's own credibility while undermining the jihadists' credibility is one of the key elements to winning this battle. It is possible to counteract the three primary terroristic communication goals, the propagation and enlargement of their movement, the legitimization of their movement and the coercion and intimidation of their enemies. Next to eliminating root causes and alleviating the underlying conditions, motivators and enablers of terrorism, such as terrorists' physical bases, developing an effective counter strategic communication plan, which exploits weaknesses and contradictions in the jihadists' use of strategic communication techniques, is vital in winning the asymmetrical conflict with jihadist terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carsten Bockstette |title=Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques |page=5 |url=http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
