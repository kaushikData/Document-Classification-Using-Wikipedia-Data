The '''Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991''' (c.50) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] applicable only in [[Scotland]] which replaced the pre-existing rule of pupillage and minority with a simpler rule that a person has full legal capacity, with some limitations, at the age of 16&lt;ref&gt;Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991, s. 1(1)(b)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Under the previous Scots law (derived from Roman law), a child to the age of 12 if female, or 14 if male, had legal status of "pupil" and was under legal control of an adult (usually parent or parents) deemed "tutor". From that age until the [[age of majority]] the child had legal status of a "minor", and might have a responsible adult deemed "curator" or have no responsible adult (being referred to as "fors familiated"). The Scottish age of majority was originally 21 until reduced to 18 by the ''Age of Majority (Scotland) Act 1969''. Pupils lacked any capacity to enter into legal contracts. Minors had capacity to enter into contracts, which included the capacity to make a [[will (law)|will]], but subject to rights to have these reduced by a court in certain circumstances, and sometimes requiring their curators consent. The rules as to when contracts did or did not require consent, and which were potentially reducible by court were complex. The age to enter into marriage was originally the age of minority, but this was raised to 16 years by the Age of Marriage Act 1929, and confirmed in the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977.

Under the Age Legal Capacity Scotland Act 1991 the old rules and terms were replaced. The basic rule under the replacement regime is that under 16s have no legal capacity. This is qualified by section 2 which provides that under 16s can:  
1) enter into a contract of a kind commonly entered into by persons of their age group, and on terms which are not unreasonable;
2) from age 12, make a Will, and are deemed to have capacity to instruct a lawyer to act on their behalf. The right to consent to an adoption was also subsequently inserted into this section by the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.

In all other cases the legal Guardian of the under 16 has legal right to deal with all contractual and consent matters on the child's behalf.

From age 16 a person has full legal capacity to enter into any form of agreement. This subject to protection for younger persons by means of a right (under section 3) while under the age of 21, to have a contract made between the ages of 16 and 18 set aside as a "prejudicial transaction". The test is whether a reasonably prudent adult would not have entered into such a contract, and the person has been prejudiced by entering into that contract. Under section 4 a contract may be approved in advance by a court, in which case it cannot later be reduced. Contracts entered into in the course of the young person's business, or where they misrepresented their age also cannot be reduced.

There is also specific provision for persons having their birthday on 29 February; under section 6 they are treated as having their birthday on 1 March in every non-leap year for purposes of calculating their age.

The '''Agreement for the Control of Opium Smoking in the Far East''', also known as the '''Agreement concerning the Suppression of Opium Smoking''', was a treaty concluded in [[Bangkok]] on 27 November 1931 and at [[Lake Success, New York]] on 11 December 1946. The treaty was signed and ratified by the [[State of Vietnam]], [[France]], [[British India]], [[Japan]], [[Laos]], [[Netherlands]], [[Thailand]], and [[United Kingdom]].

Article I provided that retail sale and distribution of [[opium]] would be limited to Government shops. Fixed salaries were mandated for retailers; sales commissions were abolished. A system of licensing and rationing smokers was permitted as an alternative to the Government retail provisions.

Article II prohibited minors under the age of 21 from smoking opium or entering smoking establishments, and mandated prison sentences for inducing minors to smoke opium, to enter an opium-smoking establishment, or to procure opium.

Other provisions mandated that opium be sold for cash only, allowed governments to establish [[monopolies]] on opium production, and limited the application of the agreement to the [[Far East]].

The Agreement was superseded by the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].

''Mohammad Alamarin v. IDF Commander in Gaza Strip'' was a 1992 case argued before Israel's [[Supreme Court(Israel)|High Court of Justice]]. Justice G. Bach delivered the majority opinion. Mohammad Alamarin filed a petition seeking to prevent the confiscation and demolition of his family's home after his son confessed to murdering 15 year old Helena Rapp. The HCJ held that the IDF commander acted within his authority under r.119 of the [[Defence (Emergency) Regulations]] when he ordered the demolition of the petitioner's sons home.

==Background==

Mohammed Alamarin's son, Fuad, was arrested by the police after the murder of 15 year old Helena Rapp. On the morning of the murder Fuad left his house with two knives he had taken from the kitchen of his home. With the knives on his person, he traveled by taxi to [[Bat Yam]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite IsrSC |court=HCJ|number=2722/92|case=Alamarin v. IDF Commander in the Gaza Strip|vol=46|part=3|reporter=PD|page=693|date=1992|url=http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/92/220/027/Z03/92027220.z03.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He told police he decided to kill the girl because he was unable to find work. Fuad admitted that he left his home with the knife because he wanted to hurt "Jews or an Israeli Arab." He confessed to stabbing Helena three to four times before running away. In his statement Fuad said he "continued stabbing her even when she fell."&lt;ref&gt;''Alamarin,'' at ¶ 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Fuad's confession IDF Commander ordered the house sealed pending [[House demolition in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|demolition]]. The confiscation and demolition of Fuad's house was authorized by the military commander under the Defence (Emergency) Regulations.

Fuad's family who also lived in the same house challenged the demolition order, arguing that Fuad was not the sole resident of the house. After the legal adviser in Gaza rejected the family's petition, Fuad's father filed his petition in the [[Supreme Court (Israel)|High Court of Justice]] (HCJ). The demolition was barred pending the outcome of his case before the HCJ.

The Defence (Emergency) Regulations of 1945 authorized the IDF commander in this case to destroy a building inhabited by a person who has committed a violent offense.&lt;ref&gt;Defence (Emergency) Regulations, 1945, r.119; ''See also'' {{Cite IsrSC |court=HCJ|number=2722/92|case=Alamarin v. IDF Commander in the Gaza Strip|vol=46|part=3|reporter=PD|page=693|date=1992|url=http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/92/220/027/Z03/92027220.z03.pdf}}(holding that IDF commander's decision to destroy petitioner's house was "not unreasonable" because petitioner's son had committed a murder).&lt;/ref&gt; The family's petition objected to the demolition on two grounds. 
#They argued that the sealing, confiscation and destruction of Fuad's family home was not permitted under r.119 of the Regulations because Fuad had committed the murder in Israel. This argument relied on the territorial limitation of the Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;''Alamarin,'' HCJ 2722/92 at ¶4.&lt;/ref&gt;
#They further argued that the Regulations would only permit the confiscation and destruction of the guilty party's room, not the entire building. Many members of Fuad's family shared the residence and they had not taken part in Fuad's actions.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{Cite IsrSC |court=HCJ|url=|number=4472/91|case=Hizran v. IDF Commander in Gaza Strip|vol=46|part=2|reporter=PD|page=150|date=1991}} (Cheshin, J., dissenting) (discussing the need to construe r.119 narrowly to limit commander's authority to only the residential unit of the suspect).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issue==
Does r. 119 of the Regulations permit the destruction of a house in the occupied territory of Gaza for a violent offense that was committed in Israel by a resident of that house?

==The High Court Decision==
===Majority===
The HCJ ruled that the demolition was reasonable under the circumstances. The majority opinion was written by Justice G. Bach.

In its opinion the HCJ wrote that an offense was committed under r.59(b) of the Regulations when Fuad left his home carrying a "particularly long knife" with the intention of killing or causing serious injury for a person, within the meaning of r.59(b):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
	"No person shall -
	..................
	(b) have in his possession any weapon, instrument or article or thing 		designed or adapted for causing death or serious injury..."&lt;ref&gt;''Alamarin,'' at ¶ 5 (alteration in original) (citation omitted)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on this language, the HCJ reasoned that r.119 did apply to the facts at issue in this case. They held that the confiscation and demolition order were within the commander's authority with regards to the first issue raised by the family's petition.

The HCJ then considered the petitioner's second objection, that the commander was at most permitted to destroy only the separate unit of the building where Fuad lived. The HCJ relied on the language of r.119 to resolve that the military commander may destroy any house " . . . the inhabitant ''or some of the inhabitants'' of which he is satisfied have committed"&lt;ref&gt;''Alamarin,'' at ¶6 (alteration in original) (citation omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; a violent offense under the Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Defence (Emergency) Regulations, 1945, r.59(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling relied on the HCJ's prior decision in ''Hizran v. IDF Commander in Gaza Strip''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite IsrSC |court=HCJ|url=|number=4472/91|case=Hizran v. IDF Commander in Gaza Strip|vol=46|part=2|reporter=PD|page=150|date=1991}}(holding that commander's authority under r.119 is broad and is not limited only to the residence of the guilty party, but "extends beyond this to the whole building (and even to the land), the inhabitants or some of the inhabitants of which have committed an offence").&lt;/ref&gt; The HCJ found no basis in "either the literal text or in the spirit" of the regulation to limit the commander's authority under r.119.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite IsrSC |court=HCJ|number=2722/92|case=Alamarin v. IDF Commander in the Gaza Strip|vol=46|part=3|reporter=PD|page=693|date=1992|url=http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/92/220/027/Z03/92027220.z03.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proportionality====
Although construed broadly, the HCJ maintained that the commander's authority under r.119 is limited by "reasonable discretion and a sense of proportion." Justice Bach proceeded to explain that the HCJ holding "does not mean . . . that this court is not able or bound to intervene in the decision of the military authority, whenever the latter intends to exercise its authority in a way and manner that are unthinkable." &lt;ref&gt;''Alamarin,'' at ¶ 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Scholarship==
Israel's policy of home demolition in Palestine has spawned a voluminous body of scholarly work. Numerous law review articles have criticized the policy for being immoral, ineffective, contrary to Jewish morals and international law, and some have argued that it may amount to an international crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Harpaz |first=Guy |title=Being Unfaithful to One's Own Principles: The Israeli Supreme Court and House Demolitions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories |year=2014 |volume=47 |journal=Isr. L. Rev. |page=401 |pin=401-402|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have argued that the Israeli High Court's jurisprudence in home demolitions cases like ''Alamarin'' is not in accordance with public international law.&lt;ref&gt;Harpaz, at 403.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to Critiscm===
Israel has argued that collective punishment is an effective deterrent against terrorism. [[Alan Dershowitz]] has said that all Palestinians who "passively support" terror attacks are guilty even if they do not provide any direct aid to the attackers. He argues that collective punishment is moral as long it is proportional to complicity.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' {{bluebook journal |last=Zemach |first=Ariel |title=The Limits of International Criminal Law: House Demolitions in an Occupied Territory |year=2004-2005 |volume=20 |journal=Conn. J. Int'l L. |page=65 | pin=65-66 |ref=harv}} (arguing for a moral gravity requirement that would "exclude conducts such as Israel's house demolitions practice" from the Rome Statute's prohibition on collective punishment).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CertificateOfOccupancy.jpg|thumb|A certificate of occupancy]]
A '''certificate of occupancy''' is a document issued by a [[local government]] agency or [[building inspection|building department]] certifying a building's [[regulatory compliance|compliance]] with applicable [[building code]]s and other laws, and indicating it to be in a [[habitability|condition suitable for occupancy]].&lt;ref name="West's,2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=West's encyclopedia of American law, Second Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/Gale, 2005|isbn=978-0-7876-6367-4 |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Certificate+of+Occupancy|author=Jeffrey Lehman|authorlink=Certificate of Occupancy|author2=Shirelle Phelps|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The procedure and requirements for the [[legal instrument|certificate]] vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and on the type of structure. In the United States, obtaining a certificate is generally required whenever:
* a new building is constructed
* a building built for one use is to be used for another (e.g., an industrial building converted for residential use)
* occupancy of a commercial or industrial building changes, or ownership of a commercial, industrial, or [[multi-family residential|multiple-family residential]] building changes

The purpose of obtaining a certificate of occupancy is to prove that, according to the law, the house or building is in liveable condition. Generally, such a certificate is necessary to be able to occupy the structure for everyday use, as well as to be able to sign a [[Real estate contract|contract to sell the space]] and close on a mortgage for the space.

A certificate of occupancy is evidence that the building complies substantially with the plans and specifications that have been submitted to, and approved by, the local authority. It complements a [[construction permit|building permit]]—a document that must be filed by the applicant with the local authority before construction to indicate that the proposed construction will adhere to [[local ordinance|ordinances]], codes, and laws.

==Temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO)==
A ''temporary'' certificate of occupancy grants residents and building owners all of the same rights as a certificate of occupancy, however it is only for a temporary period of time. In New York City, TCOs are usually active for 90 days from the date of issue, after which they expire.&lt;ref name=NYCcoaFactsheet&gt;{{cite web|title=Certificate of Occupancy|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/development/co_factsheet.shtml|publisher=New York City Department of Buildings|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is perfectly legal, and not uncommon in the given situation, for a building owner to re-apply for a TCO, following all the steps and inspections required originally, in order to hypothetically extend their TCO for another period of time.

Temporary certificates of occupancy are generally sought after and acquired when a building is still under minor construction, but there is a certain section or number of floors that are deemed to be [[habitability|habitable]], and, upon issuance of TCO, can legally be occupied or sold.

==New York City==
In [[New York City]], for a building to obtain a certificate of occupancy (CO), the structure must pass a series of [[building inspection|inspections]], as well as a walk-through from the [[New York City Department of Buildings|Department of Buildings]]. In most cases, the inspections include, but are not limited to, [[plumbing code|plumbing inspections]], [[fire sprinkler system]] inspections, [[fire alarm system]] inspections, electrical inspections, [[fire pump]] pressure tests, architectural inspections (where inspector checks if building was built in accordance with an architect's stamped and approved drawings), elevator inspections, completion of lobby, and an inspection to see if the building complies with the proper number of entrances required for its size.&lt;ref name=ReqdItemsGuide&gt;{{cite web|title=Required Items Reference Guide|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/downloads/pdf/req_items_ref_guide.pdf|publisher=Department of Buildings, New York City|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After all inspections are passed, the last step is generally to have a walk-through by a member of the Department of Buildings, who sees that there is no major construction remaining on the job site, that there are no obstructions to the entrances, that there are no safety hazards in the building, and that everything in the building was built according to plan. If the inspector approves his walk-through, a certificate of occupancy is usually granted.

The '''commodity status of animals''' refers to the legal status as [[property]] of most non-human animals, particularly [[Livestock|farmed animals]], [[working animal]]s and [[animals in sport]], and their use as objects of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoda Wilkie, [http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199927142.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199927142-e-16 "Animals as Sentient Commodities"], in Linda Kalof (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Animal Studies'', Oxford University Press (forthcoming; Wilkie's article, August 2015). {{doi|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199927142.013.16}}{{pb}}

Animals regarded as [[Commodity|commodities]] may be bought, sold, given away, bequeathed, killed, and used as commodity producers: producers of meat, eggs, milk, fur, wool, skin and offspring, among other things.&lt;ref name=Collard2015p2&gt;Rosemary-Claire Collard, Kathryn Gillespie, "Introduction," in Kathryn Gillespie, Rosemary-Claire Collard (eds.), ''Critical Animal Geographies'', London: Routledge, 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iT5yBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francione 2004, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[exchange value]] of the animal does not depend on quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;Cassuto 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LBEaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA314 314].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[commodity market]]s, animals and [[animal product]]s are classified as [[Soft commodity|soft commodities]], along with goods such as coffee and sugar, because they are grown, as opposed to [[Hard commodity|hard commodities]], such as gold and copper, which are mined.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Maul, ''Investing in Commodities'', Hamburg: Diplomica Verlag GmbH, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=skRkAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 8], table c.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|The United States [[Commodity Exchange Act]], which regulates [[commodity futures]] trading, defines [[Commodity|commodities]] as "wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool, wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal, cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock products, and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles, except onions (as provided by section 13–1 of this title) and motion picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in."&lt;ref&gt;[[Commodities Exchange Act]], U.S. Code § 1a - Definitions, Cornell University Law School.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Researchers identify viewing animals as commodities by humans as a manifestation of [[speciesism]]. The [[Veganism|vegan]] and [[Animal rights movement|animal rights movements]], chiefly the [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist approach]], of the twentieth century calls for eliminating the commodity or property status of animals.

==History and law==
{{further information|Personal property}}
Animals, when owned, are classified as personal property (movable property not attached to [[real property]]/[[real estate]]).{{refn|group=n|The four categories of property are [[personal property]] (movables, chattels), [[real property]] (land and fixtures), [[intellectual property]] (such as copyrights), and [[cultural property]] (such as national monuments).&lt;ref name=Shaffner2001p20&gt;Shaffner 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The word ''[[cattle]]'' derives from the French word ''[[cheptel]]'' or [[Old French]] word ''chatel'', or personal property.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B0CgBE155PwC&amp;pg=PA115 115–116]; [https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/chattel "Chattel"], Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Joyce Salisbury writes that the relationship between humans and animals was always expressed in terms of control, and the idea that animals become property by being domesticated. She notes that [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]] (340–397) held the view that God controlled wild animals while humanity controlled the rest. [[Isidore of Seville]] (560–636) distinguished between "cattle", a term for animals that had been domesticated, and "beasts" or wild animals, as did [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274).&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Salisbury, ''The Beast Within: Animals in the Middle Ages'', Routledge, 2012 [1994], p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PExdEod9lHEC&amp;pg=PA10 10], 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English jurist [[William Blackstone]] (1723–1780) wrote of domesticated animals, in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1765–1769):

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
In such as are of a nature tame and domestic (as horses, kine [cows], sheep, poultry, and the like), a man may have as absolute a property as in any inanimate beings&amp;nbsp;... because these continue perpetually in his occupation, and will not stray from his house or person, unless by accident or fraudulent entitlement, in either of which cases the owner does not lose his property&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', Volume 1, Callaghan, 1884 [1765–1769], p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FCjPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA389 389], cited in Wilkie 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B0CgBE155PwC&amp;pg=PA116 116].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That wild animals belong in common to everyone, or to the state, and can become personal property only if captured, is known as the "animals ferae naturae" doctrine.&lt;ref name=Shaffner2001p19/&gt; Blackstone wrote of wild animals that they are either "not the objects of property at all, or else fall under our other division, namely, that of ''qualified'', ''limited'', or ''special'' property, which is such as is not in its nature permanent, but may sometimes subsist, and at other times not subsist."&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone 1884, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FCjPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA390 390].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentience==
{{main article|Sentience|Animal consciousness}}
Writing about wild animals being imported into France in the 18th century, historian [[Louise Robbins]] writes that a "cultural biography of things" would show animals "sliding in and out of commodity status and taking on different values for different people" as they make their way from their homes to the streets of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Louise E. Robbins, ''Elephant slaves and pampered parrots: Exotic animals and their meanings in eighteenth-century France'', University of Wisconsin--Madison, 1998, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Rhoda Wilkie has used the term "sentient commodity" to describe this view of how the conception of animals as commodities can shift depending on whether a human being forms a relationship with them.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B0CgBE155PwC&amp;pg=PA115 115ff].&lt;/ref&gt; Geographers Rosemary-Claire Collard and Jessica Dempsey use the term "lively commodities."&lt;ref name=Collard2013/&gt;

Political scientist Sami Torssonen argues that animal welfare has itself been [[Commodification|commodified]] since the 1990s because of public concern for animals. "Scientifically-certified welfare products," which Torssonen calls "sellfare," are "producible and salable at various points in the commodity chain," subject to competition like any other commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Sami Torssonen, [http://www.depauw.edu/humanimalia/issue%2013/Torssonen.html "Sellfare: A History of Livestock Welfare Commodification as Governance"], 71(1), Fall 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/ccaaa190413o1904441/ Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904]&lt;/ref&gt; was a law passed by the [[Parliament of Australia]] in 1904. Its full title was an Act "relating to [[Conciliation]] and [[Compulsory arbitration|Arbitration]] for the Prevention and Settlement of Industrial Disputes extending beyond the Limits of any one State", and received assent on 15 December 1904, almost four years after the [[Federation of Australia]]. 

The Act sought to introduced the rule of law in [[industrial relations]] in Australia and, besides other things, established the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]]. 

The Act was superseded by the ''Industrial Relations Act 1988'' and was repealed by the ''Industrial Relations (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988'' with effect on 1 March 1989. The ''Industrial Relations Act 1988''  was replaced by the ''[[Workplace Relations Act 1996]]''. 
 	
==Objects of the Act==
The main objects of the Act were:
* to prevent [[lock-out]]s and [[strike action|strikes]] in relation to industrial disputes
* to constitute a [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]] having jurisdiction for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes
* to provide for the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court by conciliation with a view to amicable agreement between the parties
* in default of amicable agreement between the parties, to provide for the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court by equitable award
* to enable States to refer industrial disputes to the Court, and to permit the working of the Court and of State Industrial Authorities in aid of each other
* to facilitate and encourage the organization of representative bodies of employers and of employees and the submission of industrial disputes to the Court by organizations, and to permit representative bodies of employers and of employees to be declared organizations for the purposes of this Act
* to provide for the making and enforcement of industrial agreements between employers and employees in relation to industrial disputes.

==History==
The scope of the legislation was very controversial at the time, resulting in changes of governments of [[Alfred Deakin]] ([[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]]), [[Chris Watson]] ([[Australian Labor Party|Labour]]), and [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]] ([[Free Trade Party|Free Trade]]). 

The Bill was drafted and introduced by [[Charles Kingston]], Australia's pioneer of [[compulsory arbitration]], drawing on [[New Zealand]]'s ''[[Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894]]''. Kingston was  a Minister in Deakin's Protectionist Government, which was supported by the Labour Party. In July 1903, Kingston resigned suddenly from Deakin's  government in a fit of anger over the opposition of [[John Forrest]] and [[Edmund Barton]] to an extension of conciliation and arbitration to British and foreign seamen engaged in the Australian coastal trade. 

Labor members also withdrew their support for Deakin in April 1904 over the industrial relations law, resulting in the fall of the Deakin government. Reid Free Trade Party refused to form government, leading to the formation of the first Labour government led by Watson. Watson's government lasted only four months and was succeeded in August 1904 by Reid's which agreed to Labor's amendment to cover State government employees, and the Bill was passed with Labour's support.

'''Comodo Dragon''' is a [[freeware]] [[web browser]]. It is based on [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] and is produced by [[Comodo Group]].  Sporting a similar interface to [[Google Chrome]], Dragon does not implement Chrome's [[Google Chrome#User tracking|user tracking]] and some other potentially privacy-compromising features, substituting them for its own user tracking implementations, and provides additional [[Internet security|security]] measures, such as indicating the authenticity and relative strength of a website's [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] certificate.&lt;ref name="dec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comodo.com/home/browsers-toolbars/browser.php |title=Dragon Internet Browser – Comodo Dragon Web Browser |author= |publisher=Comodo Group, Inc. |date= |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.cnet.com/Comodo-Dragon/3000-2356_4-75119680.html |title=Comodo Dragon - Free downloads and software reviews - CNET Download.com |author=Polishchuk, Polina |publisher=CNet.com |date=25 April 2014 |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Upon installation, Comodo Dragon offers the opportunity to configure either the Comodo Dragon or the user's entire [[computer]] to use Comodo's own [[Domain Name System|DNS]] [[server (computing)|servers]] instead of the user's [[Internet service provider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/04/four-alternative-useful-browsers-based-off-of-google-chrome |title=Four Useful Alternative Browsers Based On Google Chrome- Lifehacker Australia |author=Spencer, Spanner |publisher=Allure Media |date=11 April 2014&lt;!-- 0300 AEST--&gt; |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comodo Dragon performs additional checks on the [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] [[digital certificate]]s of secure [[website]]s, and informs users if a site's [[Public key certificate|certificate]] may be of insufficient strength.

Instead of [[Google Pack#Google Updater|Google Updater]], Comodo Dragon features its own built-in updater. If Dragon is [[uninstaller|uninstalled]], users are given the option of keeping Dragon's [[web cache|cache]] and [[HTTP cookie|cookie]] files or deleting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepcsecurity.com/comodo-dragon-review-the-secured-browser-on-chromium |title=Comodo Dragon Review- The Secured Browser on Chromium- PC Security |author= |publisher=PC Security |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security issues==

A Google engineer publicly disclosed a serious security vulnerability in Comodo Dragon after Comodo failed to respond to the issue within the 90 days Google provides software vendors. The advisory warns users who install Comodo Dragon that Dragon replaces their default browser, hijacks DNS settings, and disables the [[same-origin policy]], which exposes users by allowing malicious websites to access private data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/02/google_disses_chromodo/ |title=Google calls out Comodo's Chromodo Chrome-knockoff as insecure crapware |last=Chirgwin |first=Richard |date=2 Feb 2016 |website=The Register |publisher= |access-date=13 Nov 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comodo's first attempt to patch the issue was shown to be ineffective.&lt;ref name="SecurityThreat"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3029435/security/custom-web-browser-from-comodo-poses-security-threat-researcher-says.html |title=Custom Web browser from Comodo poses severe security threat, researcher says |last=Kirk |first=Jeremy |date=3 Feb 2016 |website=PCWorld |publisher=IDG Network |access-date=13 Nov 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comodo subsequently claimed the problems were fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2016/02/03/google-says-comodos-secure-browser-isnt-safe-to-use-at-all/ |title=Google says Comodo’s ‘secure’ browser isn’t safe to use at all |last=Ghoshal |first=Abhimanyu |date=3 Feb 2016 |website=The Next Web |publisher= |access-date=14 Nov 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comodo license and tracking== 

Comodo tracks each user's time spent using the browser, its operating system, and browser inquiries about certificate revocation, which reveal the sites visited. Users can opt whether they also track activity and use in more detail than that.&lt;ref name="licenc"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Comodo and its partners use cookies and Google Analytics. "Comodo may disclose data to its affiliates and business partners who have established similar privacy standards."&lt;ref name="private"/&gt;

Their privacy statement says that only in California is the IP address considered personal information.&lt;ref name="private"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.comodo.com/repository/privacy-policy.php |title=Privacy Policy |publisher=Comodo |publication-date=2016-07-01 |access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comodo creates log files which track users, identifiable by cookie or browser features (and IP address outside California): "Comodo uses log files {{sic|comprising |hide=y|of}} non-personally identifiable information to ... track movements throughout the site ... and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use."&lt;ref name="private"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The browser is supported by ads which "relate to the content of information as part of the Product or queries made through the Product."&lt;ref name="licenc"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They include many other software products, each with its own license.

The license has common terms about complying with subpoenas and interception orders, against reverse engineering, copying and sub-licensing, and disclaiming warranties and liability.&lt;ref name="licenc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.comodo.com/repository/eula/CIS-10.0-EULA-(12-15-2016).pdf |title=Comodo Internet Security v10.0 End User License and Subscriber Agreement |publisher=Comodo |publication-date=2016-12-15 |access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The license also requires disputes to be settled by arbitration in New Jersey. Users must give accurate registration information, and pay Comodo's costs " that, directly or indirectly, are based on your breach of this agreement, information provided by you, or your infringement on the rights of a third party."

The term '''companion cases''' refers to a group of two or more [[Legal case|case]]s which are consolidated by an [[appellate court]] while on [[appeal]] and are decided together because they concern one or more common legal issues. Depending on the facts of each case, the court may be able to achieve a final resolution of all such cases (e.g., by affirming [[summary judgment]] in all of them), or it may have to [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]] one or more of them for further proceedings such as a [[trial]]. In general, one of the '''companion cases''' comes first on the case caption and serves as the title of the consolidated opinion that resolves the group of cases.

Appellate courts do not always have to consolidate cases in order to resolve several pending cases with a common legal issue. A related method is to "grant and hold", meaning that while a "lead" case presenting an increasingly common issue is being briefed and argued, all other similar cases that come into the same appellate court are granted review but then are put on hold pending the outcome of the lead case. Once the lead case is decided, the other cases are promptly remanded to the lower courts from which they originated, with directions on how to resolve them in light of the opinion issued in the lead case.

In some instances, companion cases with similar—but not identical—fact patterns are decided with different outcomes, allowing the court to establish fine dividing lines between outcomes revolving on the specific differences in the facts of each case.

A '''contingent contract''' is an [[if-then]] agreement that states which actions under certain conditions will result in specific outcomes (Thompson 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;122). Contingent contracts usually occur when [[negotiating]] parties fail to reach an agreement. The [[contract]] is characterized as "contingent" because the terms are not final and are based on certain events or conditions occurring. (Malhotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;70).

A contingent contract can also be viewed as protection against a future change of plans (Malhotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;70). Contingent contracts can also lead to effective agreement when each party has different time preferences. For example, one party may desire immediate payoffs, while the other party may be interested in more long-term payoffs (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;122). Further, contingency contracts can foster an agreement in negotiations involving resolute differences of expectations about the future (Malhotra, Baerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;69).

==Use==

Contingent contracts can be used in many types of settings such as work, school, home, etc. In regards to work, a common example of contingent contracts comes in the form of job negotiations. It usually involves the opportunity to discuss [[salary]], position, promotion, etc. However, contingent contracts can often include negotiations regarding [[flextime]], [[job sharing]], responsibilities, etc. Although contingent contracts concerning employment packages are more the exception than the norm, these types of negotiations can be very successful, allowing both parties to walk away feeling very satisfied with the newly agreed upon arrangement (Krutzberg, Naquin 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;86-87).

The following examples are everyday agreements that may occur in the [[workplace]]:
* The [[employee]] and [[employer]] agree on a 1% bonus increase at the end of the year if the employee receives all excellent marks on her performance review.
* The employee will be allowed to work two days a week from home after having worked at the company for one year, and if he submits all reports on time.
* The employee will receive full insurance coverage after having worked at the company for one full year, with less than five sick days.

The following example illustrates a behavioral contract between a [[teenager]] and [[parent]]s to be used in the home:
* The teenager agrees to attend all classes, complete homework on time, return home before curfew, communicate with parents in a respectful manner, etc.
* If the teenager violates any of the agreed upon rules, he will choose to suffer the consequences which involve being grounded, no television or Internet, not using the family car, etc.
* The parents agree that if the teenager performs the agreed upon behaviors, then the teenager will be able to keep his privileges.

A contingent contract can be used to create enormous benefit to both parties. One advantage would be that it limits the loss that would occur if the contract failed. Another would be that it wouldn't make one party gain more at the expense of the other. This leads to an increase in trust between both parties, which would allow them to have more beneficial negotiations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazerman|first1=M. H.|last2=Gillespie|first2=J. J.|title=Betting on the Future: The Virtues of Contingent Contracts|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=1999|volume=77 |issue=5|pages= 155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
In order to be most effective, contingent contracts should possess some of the following characteristics:
* The objectives for each party involved must be aligned (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;124).
* The promise is based on an uncertain event: the action required of one party is only dependent upon the occurrence of some event in the future (Sharma 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;87).
* The event must be minor to the contract: the performance of a promise is not the event; rather it is part of the contract (Sharma 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;87).
* The event is independent of the promising party: the occurrence of an event is not controlled by the promising party’s will or desire (Sharma 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;87).
* The agreements should be formalized in writing with appropriate legal counsel (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;124).
* The parties must mutually decide how the terms of agreement will be measured (Thompson 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;124).
A contingency contract can also be viewed as protection against a future change of plans

==Value==
Necessary is because the contract is built on expected differences from each party. Each party can leverage their differences through bets that lead to both sides winning (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;69). However, contingent contracts do not increase integrative value, rather they affect distribution value (Brett 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;74). Contingency contracts can create value by causing each negotiating party to stop arguing about their different beliefs. Both parties will be better off because they are each confident in their beliefs, ideas or projections (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;69).

==Risks and challenges==
Contingency contracts can be beneficial for both parties by producing value and motivating performance, however there are some situations in which contingency contracts are not the best solution (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;70). Here are some limitations (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;71):
* Contingency contracts could be threatening if the other party possesses or has access to more valuable information than you. For example, it would be unfair if one party wanted to bet on the basis of ratings because they have better access to that information.
* Contingency contracts can be risky if both parties are not in agreement of how to measure objectively. For example, define clearly what it means to promote an employee "if she does well" because each party may have different ideas or opinions about whether the contract has been met. This can lead to disagreement, which can cause great distress to the relationship between the parties (Brett 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;74).
* Contingency contracts can be dangerous if there are unequal incentives for each party. For example, there should be incentives for both parties to act in ways that are compatible with your agreement, thereby creating a win-win situation for both parties.

== Covert policing role ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}

Most [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British police]] [[List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom|forces]] have formed a unit solely for covert policing operations. One of the forces that makes extensive use of surveillance-led policing is [[Greater London]]'s [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]]. The Metropolitan Police unit was formerly a [[Specialist Operations|Specialist Operations designation]] devoted to covert policing, which was [[SO10]]. Since then, most of the Specialist Operations units have been disbanded or merged, giving way to SO10 being merged into the [[Specialist Crime Directorate (Metropolitan Police)|Specialist Crime Directorate]] to be designated SCD10. Now designated as SC&amp;O 10, it falls under the purview of [[Specialist Crime &amp; Operations]]. 

The concept of covert policing evolved from that of [[community policing]], but as criminality advanced, covert policing was seen to be needed to combat this. 

[[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] [[detective]]s usually do not wear a uniform, which stemmed from the foundation of the CID. Because detectives are often concerned with the evidence gathering stage of an investigation, they are assumed by many to be the officers required to survey suspects as they go around their daily routines, however, this is not the case. 
Specialist Surveillance Teams exist which deploy a number of covert tactics in order to gather intelligence and evidence of subjects.

== History ==

Much of Britain's police service throughout the early to mid 20th century consisted of police officers walking a beat,&lt;ref name="waldren"&gt;{{cite book |title= Armed Police, The Police Use of Firearms since 1945 |last=Waldren |first=Michael J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2007 |publisher= Sutton |location= England |isbn= 0-7509-4637-7 |pages= 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; one in each neighbourhood. This gave rise to the term "bobbies on the beat" and "golden age policing", as the officers walked constantly instead of patrolling the streets from [[police cars]].&lt;ref name="waldren"/&gt; Possibly the most accurate television portrayal of the archetypal British policing was the BBC programme ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'' (1955 to 1976).&lt;ref name="waldren"/&gt;

The Criminal Intelligence Branch (which Covert Policing was a branch of before SO designations were devised) was formed in March 1960 and provided surveillance on known criminals, keeping pace with criminal methodology and technology.&lt;ref name="waldren"/&gt;

==2009 G-20 protests==
A [[Select Committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] report on the [[2009 G-20 London summit protests]] revealed that 25 undercover officers were deployed and were mixing with demonstrators. The overall charge, [[Bob Broadhurst]], claimed that the deployment of undercover officers was unknown to him at the time, and that the plainclothes officers were "evidence gatherers".{{r|g20}}

== Disclosure of relationships and children by undercover officers==
{{main|UK undercover policing relationships scandal}}
Around the end of 2010 and during 2011,{{when|date=January 2016}} it was disclosed in UK media, that a number of undercover police officers had, as part of their 'false persona', entered into intimate relationships with members of targeted groups and in some cases proposed marriage or fathered children with protesters who were unaware their partner was a police officer in a role as part of their official duties.&lt;ref name=DMail1347478&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1347478/Mark-Kennedy-Undercover-policeman-tells-story-8-years-eco-warriors.html|title='I'm the victim of smears': Undercover policeman denies bedding a string of women during his eight years with eco-warriors|first=Caroline |last=Graham|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=17 January 2011|accessdate=19 January 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various legal actions followed, including eight women who took action against the Metropolitan Police and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), stating they were deceived into long-term intimate relationships by five officers, including [[Mark Kennedy (police officer)|Mark Kennedy]], the first officer identified in 2010 as infiltrating social and environmental justice campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/deceived-lovers-speak-of-mental-torture-from-undercover-detectives-8515915.html | date = 1 March 2013 | accessdate = 17 March 2014 | first = Paul |last = Peachey | work = [[The Independent]]|location=London | title = Deceived lovers speak of mental 'torture' from undercover detectives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/16/lovers-undercover-officers-sue-police | date = 16 December 2011 | accessdate = 19 March 2015 | first1 = Paul |last1 = Lewis | first2 = Rob | last2 = Evans | work = [[The Guardian]]|location=London | title = Former lovers of undercover officers sue police over deceit}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Kennedy himself who claimed in turn that he had been incompetently handled by his superiors and denied [[psychological counselling]].&lt;ref name=DMail1347478&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1347478/Mark-Kennedy-Undercover-policeman-tells-story-8-years-eco-warriors.html|title='I'm the victim of smears': Undercover policeman denies bedding a string of women during his eight years with eco-warriors|first=Caroline |last=Graham|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=17 January 2011|accessdate=19 January 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Guardian'',&lt;ref name=fk&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/25/spy-mark-kennedy-sues-police |title=Spy Mark Kennedy sues Police |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 November 2012 |first1=Armelia |last1=Hill|accessdate=19 March 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy sued the police for ruining his life and failing to "protect" him from falling in love with one of the environmental activists whose movement he infiltrated.

It later emerged that Kennedy had previously undertaken criminal acts as part of his role for other countries, including [[Denmark]] where he stated that, in the guise of an environmental activist, he was used by the police forces of 22 countries and was responsible for the closing down of the [[Ungdomshuset|Youth House community centre]] in Copenhagen,&lt;ref name="paul-evans"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/13/undercover-policeman-admits-spying-danish-activists |title=Undercover policeman admits spying on Danish activists |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London|date=13 November 2011 |first1=Rob |last1=Evans |first2=Paul|last2=Lewis|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Germany, for German police, including [[arson]].&lt;ref name="paul-evans" /&gt; The use of undercover officers also caused the collapse of trials and led to the revelation of unlawful withholding of evidence by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]].

In November 2015 the Metropolitan Police force apologized unreservedly to seven women "tricked into relationships" over a period of 25 years by officers in the [[Special Demonstration Squad]] (SDS) and the [[National Public Order Intelligence Unit]] (NPOIU).&lt;ref name="bbc_nov2015"&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34875197&lt;/ref&gt; The officers involved had eventually "vanished", leaving questions and deceit behind, described by victims as "[[psychological torture]]".&lt;ref name="guardian_jan2016"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/18/police-spy-carlo-neri-woman-sues-psychological-torture&lt;/ref&gt; Financial settlements estimated at £3 million for the seven claimants were also made as part of the settlement.&lt;ref name="telegraph_nov2015"&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12007287/Scotland-Yard-apologises-to-seven-women-deceived-into-relationships-with-undercover-officers.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Crown Prosecutors declined to bring charges against any police officers or their supervisors, including charges for [[rape]] and other sexual crimes (covering sex under false pretences, unconsented sexual acts, and other potential offences). The CPS statement stated that misrepresenting identity, and obtaining sexual consent due to a false identity, did not generally create an offence of [[rape in English law]], other than in specific statuory-defined situations, and therefore rape charges would be unlikely to succeed. For similar reasons, [[indecent assault]], procurement for sexual intercourse by false pretences, and [[Official misconduct|misconduct in office]] were also felt to lack sufficient basis for a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/latest_news/charging_decision_concerning_mps_special_demonstration_squad/ CPS statement on decision not to charge police officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The disclosures also led to the closing of the units concerned, and a public inquiry titled the "[[Undercover Policing Inquiry]]", concerning the conduct of police in undercover operations. The inquiry is led by senior judge [[Christopher Pitchford|Lord Justice Pitchford]], a [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] and member of the [[Privy Council]].&lt;ref name="guardian_jan2016" /&gt;

==Media==
Several now-exposed undercover police are profiled in the book ''Undercover: The True Story of Britain's Secret Police'' (2013).

The play ''Any Means Necessary'' is based on the infiltration of the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station protest. It was the staged at [[Nottingham Playhouse]] in February 2016.{{r|post16}}

A planned television drama series is based on the story of the undercover officers.{{r|span1|span2}}

{{wikisource}}
{{Events leading to US Civil War}}
The '''Crittenden Compromise''' was an unsuccessful proposal introduced by United States Senator [[John J. Crittenden]] ([[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Unionist]] of Kentucky) on December 18, 1860. It aimed to resolve the [[American Civil War#Secession begins|secession crisis]] of 1860&amp;ndash;1861 by addressing the fears and grievances about slavery that led many [[Slave and free states|slave-holding states]] to contemplate [[secession]] from the United States.

==Background==
The compromise proposed six [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] amendments and four Congressional resolutions. Crittenden introduced the package on December 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/critten.asp Amendments Proposed in Congress by Senator John J. Crittenden: December 18, 1860] Avalon Project&lt;/ref&gt;  It was [[table (parliamentary procedure)|table]]d on December 31.

It guaranteed the permanent existence of slavery in the slave states and addressed Southern demands in regard to fugitive slaves and slavery in the [[District of Columbia]]. It proposed re-instating the [[Missouri Compromise]] (which had been functionally repealed in 1854 by the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], and struck down entirely in 1857 by the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott decision]]), and extending the compromise line to the west, with slavery prohibited north of the 36° 30&amp;prime; parallel and guaranteed south of it. The compromise included a clause that it could not be repealed or amended.

The compromise was popular among Southern members of the Senate, but it was generally unacceptable to the Republicans, who opposed the expansion of slavery beyond the states where it already existed into the territories. The opposition of their party's leader, President-elect [[Abraham Lincoln]], was crucial. Republicans said the compromise "would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and [[Tierra del Fuego]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uuEA7xIUHUC&amp;pg=PA115&amp; |title= Battle cry of freedom: the Civil War era |author=[[James M. McPherson]] |year= 1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=United States of America|isbn=0-19-516895-X |page = 904 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only territories south of the line were parts of [[New Mexico Territory]] and [[Indian Territory]]. There was considerable agreement on both sides that slavery would never flourish in New Mexico. The South refused the House Republicans' proposal, approved by committee on December 29, to admit New Mexico as a state immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Impending Crisis|author=David M.

''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to "the whole future growth of the Republic" and "all the Territory that can ever belong to the United States, — the whole of Mexico and Central America".

The 1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] line of 36° 30′ N. separated Missouri from the [[Arkansas Territory]], but barred slavery from any new states and territories north of this line and west of Missouri, as did the Crittenden Compromise proposed forty years later. (However, this part of the Compromise of 1820 had been largely negated by the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] of 1854 and the U.S. Supreme Court's [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott decision]] in 1857.)]]

==Components==

===Amendments to the Constitution===
#Slavery would be prohibited in any [[territory of the United States]] "now held, or hereafter acquired," north of latitude [[Parallel 36°30′ north|36 degrees, 30 minutes]] line. In territories south of this line, slavery of the [[African-Americans|African race]] was "hereby recognized" and could not be interfered with by Congress. Furthermore, property in African slaves was to be "protected by all the departments of the territorial government during its continuance." States would be admitted to the Union from any territory with or without slavery as their constitutions provided. 
#Congress was forbidden to abolish slavery in places under its jurisdiction within a slave state such as a military post. 
#Congress could not abolish slavery in the District of Columbia so long as it existed in the adjoining states of Virginia and Maryland and without the consent of the District's inhabitants. Compensation would be given to owners who refused consent to abolition. 
#Congress could not prohibit or interfere with the interstate slave trade. 
#Congress would provide full compensation to owners of rescued fugitive slaves. Congress was empowered to sue the county in which obstruction to the fugitive slave laws took place to recover payment; the county, in turn, could sue "the wrong doers or rescuers" who prevented the return of the fugitive. 
#No future amendment of the Constitution could change these amendments or authorize or empower Congress to interfere with slavery within any slave state.&lt;ref name="36th_2nd_114"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cong. Globe, 36th Cong., 2nd Sess. 114 (1860).|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=055/llcg055.db&amp;recNum=115|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional resolutions===
#That [[fugitive slave laws]] were constitutional and should be faithfully observed and executed. 
#That all state laws which impeded the operation of fugitive slave laws, the so-called "[[Personal liberty laws]]," were unconstitutional and should be repealed. 
#That the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] should be amended (and rendered less objectionable to the North) by equalizing the fee schedule for returning or releasing alleged fugitives and limiting the powers of marshals to summon citizens to aid in their capture. 
#That laws for the suppression of the [[African slave trade]] should be effectively and thoroughly executed.&lt;ref name="36th_2nd_114" /&gt;

[[File:John Jordan Crittenden - Brady 1855.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Matthew Brady's 1855 portrait of Sen. Crittenden]]
Both the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] rejected Crittenden's proposal. It was part of a series of last-ditch efforts to provide the Southern states with sufficient reassurances to forestall their secession during the final session of Congress prior to the Lincoln administration taking office.

The Crittenden proposals were also discussed at the [[Peace Conference of 1861]], a meeting of more than 100 of the nation's leading politicians, held February 8-27, 1861, in [[Washington, D.C.]] The conference, led by former President [[John Tyler]], was the final formal effort of the states to avert the start of war.  There too, the Compromise proposals failed, as the provision guaranteeing slave ownership throughout all Western territories and future acquisitions again proved unpalatable.

A February 1861 editorial in the ''Charleston Courier'' ([[Charleston, Missouri]]) summed up the mood prevalent in Southern-leaning border counties as the Crittenden proposals went down in defeat: "Men at Washington think there is no chance for peace, and indeed we can see but little, everything looks gloomy.  The Crittenden resolutions have been voted down again and again.  Is there any other proposition which will win, that the South can accept? If not—there comes war—and woe to the wives and daughters of our land; beauty will be but an incentive to crime, and plunder but pay for [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] raids.  Let our citizens be prepared for the worst, it may come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://digital.shsmo.org/cdm/fullbrowser/collection/cc/id/386/rv/compoundobject/cpd/389/rec/1 | title=Editorial | work=Charleston Courier (Charleston, Mo) | date=February 1, 1861 | accessdate=February 16, 2012 | author=Whitcomb, Geo. | location=Charleston, Missouri | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This statement by editor  George Whitcomb came in response to a fiery "letter to the editor" excoriating "disunion", from US Representative [[John William Noell]], whose district included Charleston.

'''Crushed stone''' or '''angular rock''' is a form of [[construction aggregate]], typically produced by mining a suitable rock deposit and breaking the removed rock down to the desired size using [[crusher]]s. It is distinct from [[gravel]] which is produced by natural processes of weathering and erosion, and typically has a more rounded shape.

==Uses==
Angular crushed stone is the key material for [[macadam]] road construction which depends on the interlocking of the individual stones' angular faces for its strength.&lt;ref name="isbn90-5699-159-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Max Lay |title=Handbook of Road Technology (Transportation Studies) |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |location=Washington, DC |year= 1998|pages= 28|isbn=90-5699-159-0 | quote = The strength and stiffness of the course of compacted angular stone came from the mechanical interlock which developed between individual pieces of stone. The principle is still used in modem road construction and since 1820 McAdam's name has been remembered by the term macadam used to describe the courses of unbound angular stone which he introduced.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crushed natural stone is also used similarly without a binder for [[riprap]], railroad [[track ballast]], and [[filter stone]]. It may be used with a binder in a [[composite material]] such as concrete, [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]], or [[asphalt concrete]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8247-2605-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cunningham, William D. |author2=McKetta, John J. |title=Encyclopedia of chemical processing and design |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] |location=New York, N.Y |year=1976 |pages= 284 |isbn=0-8247-2605-7 | quote = Crushed stone can be used without binder for a variety of construction or industrial applications, or it may be mixed with a matrix binding material, such as bituminous or portland  cement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hanson Aggregates Bellefonte PA.jpg|thumb|right|Crushed [[limestone]] [[quarry]] near [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania]].]]

==Background==
Crushed stone is one of the most accessible [[natural resource]]s, and is a major basic [[raw material]] used by [[construction]], agriculture, and other industries. Despite the low value of its basic products, the crushed stone industry is a major contributor to and an indicator of the [[Measures of national income and output|economic well-being of a nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/ |title=USGS Minerals Information: Crushed Stone |accessdate=2007-11-11 |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The demand for crushed stone is determined mostly by the level of construction activity, and, therefore, the demand for construction materials.&lt;ref name=Tepordei&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/stat/ |title= Statistical Compendium - Crushed Stone|accessdate=2007-11-11 | date=1997-11-04 | first = Valentin V. | last = Tepordei |publisher = U.S. Geological Survey |work= Minerals Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone resources of the world are very large. High-purity [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]] suitable for specialty uses are limited in many geographic areas. Crushed stone substitutes for [[roadbuilding]] include [[sand]] and [[gravel]], and [[slag]]. Substitutes for crushed stone used as construction aggregates include sand and gravel, iron and steel slag, [[sintered]] or expanded [[clay]] or [[shale]], and [[perlite]] or [[vermiculite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/stcrumcs07.pdf |title= Stone (Crushed)|accessdate=2007-11-11 |date = January 2007 | first = Jason Christopher | last = Willett |publisher = U.S. Geological Survey |work= Mineral Commodity Summaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crushed stone is a high-volume, low-value [[commodity]]. The industry is highly competitive and is characterized by many operations serving local or regional markets. Production costs are determined mainly by the cost of labor, equipment, energy, and water, in addition to the costs of compliance with [[Environmental law|environmental]] and [[Occupational safety and health|safety]] regulations. These costs vary depending on geographic location, the nature of the deposit, and the number and type of products produced. Crushed stone has one of the lowest average by weight values of all mineral commodities. The average unit price increased from US$1.58 per metric ton, f.o.b. plant, in 1970 to US$4.39 in 1990. However, the unit price in constant 1982 dollars fluctuated between US$3.48 and US$3.91 per metric ton for the same period. Increased [[productivity]] achieved through increased use of [[automation]] and more efficient equipment was mainly responsible for maintaining the prices at this level.&lt;ref name=Tepordei/&gt;

Transportation is a major factor in the delivered price of crushed stone. The cost of moving crushed stone from the plant to the market often equals or exceeds the sale price of the product at the plant. Because of the high cost of transportation and the large quantities of bulk material that have to be shipped, crushed stone is usually marketed locally. The high cost of transportation is responsible for the wide dispersion of quarries, usually located near highly populated areas. However, increasing land values combined with local environmental concerns are moving crushed stone quarries farther from the end-use locations, increasing the price of delivered material. [[Economies of scale]], which might be realized if fewer, larger operations served larger marketing areas, would probably not offset the increased transportation costs.&lt;ref name=Tepordei/&gt;

==United States statistical data==
According to the [[United States Geological Survey]], 1.72&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes of crushed stone worth $13.8&amp;nbsp;billion was sold or used in 2006, of which 1.44&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes was used as [[construction aggregate]], 74.9&amp;nbsp;million tonnes used for cement manufacture, and 18.1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes used to make [[lime (material)|lime]]. Crushed [[marble]] sold or used totaled 11.8&amp;nbsp;million tonnes, the majority of which was ground very fine and used as [[calcium carbonate]].

In 2006, 9.40&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone (almost all [[limestone]] or [[dolomite]]) was used for [[soil]] treatment, primarily to reduce [[soil acidity]]. Soils tend to become acidic from heavy use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers, unless a [[soil conditioner]] is used. Using aglime  or [[agricultural lime]], a finely-ground limestone or dolomite, to change the soil from acidic to nearly neutral particularly benefits crops by maximizing availability of plant nutrients, and also by reducing aluminum or [[manganese]] toxicity, promoting soil microbe activity, and improving the soil structure.

In 2006, 5.29&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone (mostly limestone or dolomite) was used as a flux in [[blast furnaces]] and in certain steel furnaces to react with [[gangue]] minerals (i.e. [[silica]] and silicate impurities) to produce liquid [[slag]] that floats and can be poured off from the much denser molten metal (i.e., iron). The slag cools to become a stone-like material that is commonly crushed and recycled as [[construction aggregate]].

In addition, 4.53&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone was used for fillers and extenders (including asphalt fillers or extenders), 2.71&amp;nbsp;million tonnes for sulfur oxide removal-mine dusting-acid water treatment, and 1.45&amp;nbsp;million tonnes sold or used for poultry grit or mineral food.

Crushed stone is recycled primarily as [[construction aggregate]] or concrete.

==Landscape use==
Crushed stone or '[[road metal]]' is used in [[landscape design]] and gardening for gardens, parks, and municipal and private projects as a [[mulch]], [[walkway]], path, and [[driveway]] pavement, and cell infill for modular [[permeable paving]] units. As a mineral mulch its benefits include erosion control, water conservation, weed suppression, and aesthetic qualities. It is often seen used in [[rock garden]]s and [[cactus garden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/factsheets/mulch/mulchland.html#stone Cornell University: Gardening Resources - mulches]. accessed 5.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://landscaping.about.com/od/drivewaysandwalkways1/f/gravel_driveway.htm AboutGardens: Crushed stone driveways]. accessed 5.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Cyphernomicon'''" is a document written by [[Timothy C. May]] in 1994 for the [[Cypherpunk]]s [[electronic mailing list]]. In a [[FAQ]] format, the document outlines some of the ideas behind, and the effects of, [[crypto-anarchism]].&lt;ref name="Cyphernomicon"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cyphernomicon: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666|last=May |first=Timothy C. |date=September 10, 1994 |url= http://www.cypherpunks.to/faq/cyphernomicron/cyphernomicon.html |work=Cypherpunks.to |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the philosophy's founding documents, advocating [[electronic privacy]] and anonymous [[Electronic money|digital currency]]. It also touches on more esoteric topics, such as [[assassination markets]]. It also contains May's 1992 essay "The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto" in its entirety.

== Sample ==
"The Cyphernomicon" is divided into a hierarchy of sections and subsections: 

&lt;pre&gt;
16.2 - SUMMARY: Crypto Anarchy

16.2.1. Main Points
  - "...when you want to smash the State, everything looks like
     a hammer."
  - strong crypto as the "building material" for cyberspace
     (making the walls, the support beams, the locks)
16.2.2. Connections to Other Sections
  - this section ties all the other sections together
16.2.3. Where to Find Additional Information
  - again, almost nothing written on this
  - Vinge, Friedman, Rand, etc.
16.2.4. Miscellaneous Comments
  - a very long section, possibly confusing to many
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4767">'''Day shapes''' are mast head [[Maritime flag signalling|signals]] visually indicating the status of a vessel to other vessels on navigable waters during daylight hours whether making-way, anchored, or aground.  These signals consist of a set of simple geometric shapes: ''ball, cylinder, cone,'' and ''diamond'' that are displayed, hung from a mast, in a prescribed manner to indicate a vessel's operational status; some of these signals may be somewhat involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Commandant US Coast Guard|title=Navigation Rules: International and Inland|date=25 March 1999|publisher=US Department of Transportation, US Coast Guard|location=PART C—LIGHTS AND SHAPES|pages=38-112|edition=COMDTINST 16672.2D|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The meanings of the shapes are defined by the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] (ColRegs).

[[File:AMarcasDiurnas.PNG|thumb|right|Day shapes from COLREG]]

Day shapes are black in color and their sizes are determined by the ColRegs, for instance the size of the ''ball'' is not less than 0.6 meter diameter.  The vertical distance between shapes is at least 1.5 meters.  Vessels of less than 20 meters length may use shapes of smaller size commensurate with the size of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Commandant US Coast Guard|title=Navigation Rules: International and Inland|date=25 March 1999|publisher=US Department of Transportation: US Coast Guard|location=ANNEX I—POSITIONING AND TECHNICAL DETAILS OF LIGHTS AND SHAPES|page=140|edition=COMDTINST M16672.2D|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day shapes of standard and reduced sizes are both commercially available. Day shapes are commonly constructed from a light weight frame covered with fabric and are designed to be collapsible for ease of storage.

Day shapes are designed to correspond to the various navigation lights required to be shown at night, and are required to be complied with by day from sunrise to sunset.  The appropriate lights may also be displayed during the day at times of restricted visibility or other necessary circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Commandant US Coast Guard|title=Navigation Rules: International and Inland|date=25 March 1999|publisher=US Department of Transportation: US Coast Guard|location=PART C—LIGHTS AND SHAPES|page=38|edition=COMDTINST M16672.2D|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vessels under 7 meters are generally not required to display day shapes even if they are required to display lights at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Commandant US Coast Guard|title=Navigation Rules: International and Inland|date=25 March 1999|publisher=US Department of Transportation: US Coast Guard|location=PART C—LIGHTS AND SHAPES|page=110|edition=COMDTINST M16672.2D|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A square black flag displayed over the ''ball'' may be used as a distress signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Commandant US Coast Guard|title=Navigation Rules: International and Inland|date=25 March 1999|publisher=US Department of Transportation: US Coast Guard|location=PART C—LIGHTS AND SHAPES|page=126|edition=COMDTINST M16672.2D|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Digital Invoice Customs Exchange (DICE)''' is a revenue protection idea developed to prevent tax evasion methods such as sales suppression in [[domestic trade]] and [[missing trader fraud]], [[transfer pricing]] in cross-[[border trade]]. As such, the implementation of this idea enables Revenue Authority to have advance notice of every commercial transaction.

Definition of the term "DICE" is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A technology-intensive tax compliance regimen for VAT/GST that utilizes invoice encryption to safeguard transactional data exchanged between seller and buyer in both domestic and import/export contexts while simultaneously notifying concerned jurisdictions of the transaction details.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2314478]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==How it works==
A seller produces digital invoice containing minimum requirements as follows:
* Name of the seller with unique [[Taxpayer Identification Number]];
* Name of the purchaser with unique [[Taxpayer Identification Number]];
* Description of good/service;
* Unit price;
* Quantity;
* Tax rate;
* Total price with tax.

Such prepared invoice, along with proper authentication of the seller, is uploaded to the Revenue Authority server (seller's jurisdiction) using DICE protocol for safekeeping and signature processing. Based on the information provided by the seller, system will apply verifiable electronic signature and send it back in the same manner as it was received. Seller will include electronic signature received in return to finalize invoice before dispatching it to customer who may verify the content of the invoice at any time by checking the signature using Revenue Authority's or DICE's web portal.

In case customer is registered outside of the seller's jurisdiction, before signing the invoice Revenue Authority will provide notice to the other jurisdiction announcing the customer's identity and content of the invoice using DICE protocol. Given the fact that DICE is being used in another jurisdiction (meaning there is an agreement between two jurisdictions to use DICE protocol and exchange digital keys for the purpose of secure communication), the received information will be processed to acknowledge positively that customer is registered in accordance with the applicable Laws, thus the transaction is considered legal. If customer is not registered in the database of the receiving jurisdiction, invoice will not be completed with valid electronic signature.

==Benefits==
* DICE platform is based on [[open standard]];
* Secure communication between jurisdictions;
* Transparency in trade between legal entities;
* Disabling tax refund based on invalid documents;
* Verification of original invoice content available at any time;
* Taxpayer's [[audit trail]] is available at the Revenue Authority.

The '''Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993''' ('''FMLA''') is a [[United States labor law]] requiring covered employers to provide employees with job-protected and unpaid leave for qualified medical and family reasons. These include [[pregnancy]], [[adoption]], [[foster care]] placement of a child, personal or family illness, or family military leave.&lt;ref&gt;"Family and Medical Leave Act," Stephen Bruce. HR Daily Advisor. [http://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/archive/category/1011.aspx] Retrieved on 20 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The FMLA is administered by the [[Wage and Hour Division]] of the [[United States Department of Labor]].

The FMLA was intended "to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families."&lt;ref&gt;"Findings and Purposes," 29 U.S.C. § 2601 http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/fmla.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Act allows eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to attend to the serious health condition of the employee, parent, spouse or child, or for pregnancy or care of a newborn child, or for adoption or foster care of a child. In order to be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have been at the business at least 12 months, and worked at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work at a location where the company employs 50 or more employees within 75 miles. The FMLA covers both public- and private-sector employees, but certain categories of employees are excluded, including elected officials and their personal staff members.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;29 U.S.C. § 2611&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] was a major part of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's]] agenda in his first term. Rapid growth in the workforce, including a large number of women joining, suggested a necessary federal regulation that would support the working class who desired to raise a family and/or required time off for illness related situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=46777|title=William J. Clinton: Statement on Signing the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Clinton signed the bill into law on February 5, 1993 ({{USPL|103|3}}; [[29 U.S.C.]] sec. 2601; 29 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 825) to take effect on August 5, 1993.

The United States Congress passed the Act with the understanding that “it is important for the development of children and the [[family]] unit that fathers and mothers be able to participate in early [[Parenting|childrearing]] … [and] the lack of employment policies to accommodate working parents can force individuals to choose between job security and parenting”.&lt;ref&gt;Congress. 1993. Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Washington, D.C. pH.R.1–2 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; It also stressed the Act was intended to provide leave protection for individuals “in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers”.&lt;ref&gt;Congress. 1993.

But in 2016, four states had legislated for [[paid family leave]].&lt;ref&gt;[[California]], [[New Jersey]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Scope of rights===
The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 generally applies to employers of 50 or more employees in 20 weeks of the last year. Employees must have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year (around 25 hours a week). However, employees "at which such employer employs less than 50 employees if the total number of employees employed by that employer within 75 miles of that worksite is less than 50."&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2611(2)&lt;/ref&gt; A worksite includes a public agency, including schools and state, local, and federal employers. The 50 employee threshold does not apply to public agency employees and local educational agencies. There are special hours rules for certain airline employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Family and Medical Leave Act Airline Flight Crew Technical Amendments|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/airline.htm#.UMkHuIPAdBM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is "foreseeable",&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2612(e)&lt;/ref&gt; and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged "so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer" according to medical advice.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2612(e)(2)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Along with the 30 day notice, there are also other requirements to be made when seeking the FMLA rights. If an employee wants to leave the first time using ones FMLA rights, the person must first claim the Family and Medical Leave Act. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/family-and-medical-leave/&lt;/ref&gt; In the case that an employee were to leave again under the FMLA act, the same process must proceed. 
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

With the release of employees, there is a [[certification]] as well. The absence of an employee due to the conditions he or she may have may require a certification as proof of the verification of absence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In order to certify the leave of an employee, the employer may ask for other requirements. An example of these requirements are requiring multiple medical opinions. All of these prerequisites are at the employer's [[expense]]. There are also certain rules that may apply to those who work at local education [[Institution|agencies]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights during leave===
Employees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child birth, adoption, to care for a close relative in poor health, or because of an employee's own poor health.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2512(a)(2) and on adoption, see ''[[Kelley v Crosfield Catalysts]]'' 135 F2d 1202 (7th Circuit 1998) The same rules for federal employees were codified in 5 USC §§6381–6387.&lt;/ref&gt; In full, the purposes for leave are:
* to care for a new child, whether for the birth, the adoption, or placement of a child in foster care;
* to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, son, daughter, or parent) (Note: Son/daughter has been clarified by the Department of Labor to mean a child under the age of 18 or a child over the age of 18 with a mental or physical disability as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act, which excludes among other conditions, pregnancy and post-partum recovery from childbirth);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DoL Opinion|url=http://www.dol.gov/WHD/opinion/fmla/prior2002/FMLA-51.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* to recover from a worker’s own serious illness;
* to care for an injured service member in the family; or
* to address qualifying exigencies arising out of a family member’s deployment.
* twenty-six workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness if the eligible employee is the servicemember’s spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/ |title=Family and Medical Leave Act – Wage and Hour Division (WHD) – U.S. Department of Labor |publisher=Dol.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child care leave should be taken in one lump, unless an employer agrees otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2612(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt; If a father and mother have the same employer, they must share their leave, in effect halving each person's rights, if the employer so chooses.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2612(f) “the aggregate number of workweeks of leave to which both may be entitled may be limited to 12 workweeks”&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2614(c). If an employee quits, the employer is enabled to recoup costs.&lt;/ref&gt; Under §2652(b) states are empowered to provide "greater family or medical leave rights".

Since 2008, the US Department of Labor, allowed the spouse, child, or parent of an active duty military member who is deployed across seas for 12 or more months to take up to 12 weeks of leave. Also, a military caregiver provision was added that would allow a caregiver to take up to 26 weeks of leave in order to actively care for a military member who requires medical attention for acute or ongoing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/MilitaryFLProvisions.htm|title=Military Family Leave Provisions of the FMLA - Wage and Hour Division (WHD) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=www.dol.gov|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substitute leave===
Under §2612(2)(A) an employer can make an employee substitute the right to 12 unpaid weeks of leave for "accrued paid vacation leave, personal leave or family leave" in an employer's personnel policy. Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc]]'' held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/2002/557.html 535 US 81] (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to return to job===
After unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to his or her job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal "is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer."&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2614(b). Under 29 USC §2612(b)(2) employers may transfer employees to another position with similar pay and benefits if health absences could be intermittent. Under §2618 special rules apply for employees of local educational agencies.&lt;/ref&gt; In full, the rights during and after unpaid leave are to:
* the same group health insurance benefits, including employer contributions to premiums, that would exist if the employee were not on leave.
* restoration to the same position upon return to work. If the same position is unavailable, the employer must provide the worker with a position that is substantially equal in pay, benefits, and responsibility.
* protection of employee benefits while on leave. An employee is entitled to reinstatement of all benefits to which the employee was entitled before going on leave.
* protection of the employee to not have their rights under the Act interfered with or denied by an employer.
* protection of the employee from retaliation by an employer for exercising rights under the Act.
* intermittent FMLA leave for his or her own serious health condition, or the serious health condition of a family member. This includes occasional leave for doctors’ appointments for a chronic condition, treatment (e.g., physical therapy, psychological counseling, chemotherapy), or temporary periods of incapacity (e.g., severe morning sickness, asthma attack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vedder Price|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/struggling-intermittent-fmla-leave |title=Struggling with Intermittent FMLA Leave |publisher=The National Law Review |date= January 26, 2011|accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Highly compensated employees” have limited rights to return to their jobs. They are defined as “a salaried eligible employee who is among the highest paid 10 percent of the employees employed by the employer within 75 miles of the facility at which the employee is employed”.&lt;ref name="Congress 1993"&gt;Congress. 1993. Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Washington, D.C. pH.R.1–8 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt; Their employers are not required to restore them to their original position (or an equivalent position with equivalent pay and benefits, as is guaranteed to other employees) if the employer determines that denying the employee their position is “necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer” &lt;ref name="Congress 1993"/&gt; and the employer provides the worker with notice of this decision, though no time frame for providing this notice is established.

===Enforcement===
Employees or the [[Secretary of Labor]] can bring enforcement actions,&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2617, and see ''[[Frizzell v Southwest Motor Freight]]'', 154 F3d 641 (6th Circuit 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no right to a jury for reinstatement claims. Employees can seek damages for lost wages and benefits, or the cost of child care, plus an equal amount of liquidated damages unless an employer can show it acted in good faith and reasonable cause to believe it was not breaking the law.&lt;ref&gt;29 USC §2617(a)(1)(A)(iii)&lt;/ref&gt; There is a two-year limit on bringing claims, or three years for willful violations.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Moore v Payless Shoe Source]]'' (8th Circuit 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-eligible workers and types of leave===
The federal FMLA does not apply to:
* workers in businesses with fewer than 50 employees (this threshold does not apply to public agency employers and local educational agencies as they are covered employers by name but there still must be at least 50 employees with a 75 mile radius for the employee to be eligible for FMLA leave&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;);
* [[part-time]] workers who have worked fewer than 1,250 hours within the 12 months preceding the leave and a paid vacation;
* workers who need time off to care for seriously ill elderly relatives (other than parents), unless the relative was acting ''[[in loco parentis]]'' at the time the worker turned 18;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Coutard v. Municipal Credit Union 2017 WL 526060 (2d Cir. Feb. 9, 2017)''&lt;/ref&gt;
* workers who need time off to care for pets;
* workers who need time off to recover from short-term or common illness like a cold, or to care for a family member with a short-term illness;
* elected officials; and
* workers who need time off for routine medical care, such as check-ups.

==State family leave==
Some states have enacted laws that mandate additional family and medical leave for workers in a variety of ways. By 2016 four states had laws for paid family leave: [[California]] since 2002, [[New Jersey]] since 2008, [[Rhode Island]] since 2013, and [[New York (state)|New York]] since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/work-family/paid-leave/paid-family-and-medical-leave.pdf|title=Paid Family and Medical Leave: An Overview|last=|first=|date=March 2015|website=|publisher=National Partnership for Women &amp; Families|access-date=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ny.gov/programs/paid-family-leave-strong-families-strong-ny|title=Paid Family Leave: Strong Families, Strong NY|date=2016-01-22|website=Welcome to the State of New York|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington state passed a paid family and medical leave law in 2007, but the law has not taken effect due to a lack of funding mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/07/26/2360341/washington-paid-family-leave/|title=Endless Delays May Doom Paid Family Leave In Washington State|website=ThinkProgress|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dropping the employer threshold===
The federal FMLA only applies to employers with 50 or more employees, within 75 miles. Some states have enacted their own FMLAs that have a lower threshold for employer coverage:
* [[Maine]]: 15 or more employees (private employers)&lt;ref&gt;26 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26 § *843 (3)(A)&lt;/ref&gt; and 25 or more (city or town employers).&lt;ref&gt;26 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26 § 843 (3)(C)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Maryland]]: 15 or more employees (private employers)Up to seven days for bone marrow donation. Up to 30 days for organ donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dbm.maryland.gov/employees/Documents/Leave/fmlabookletAugust2013.pdf |title=FAMILY AND MEDICAL  LEAVE ACT (FMLA) GUIDE |publisher=STATE OF MARYLAND |date=August 2013 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2009rs/bills_noln/sb/tsb0562.pdf |title=SENATE BILL 562 |publisher= |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Minnesota]]: 21 or more employees ([[parental leave]] only).&lt;ref&gt;Minn. Stat. § 181.940 (Subd. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oregon]]: 25 or more employees. An employee must have worked at least 180 days, and averaged 25 hours per week at the time medical leave is requested&lt;ref&gt;Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.153 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.employmentlawhq.com/state-requirements/oregon.html|title=Oregon FMLA Laws|website=www.employmentlawhq.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rhode Island]]: 50 or more employees (private employers)&lt;ref&gt;R.I. Pub. Laws §28-48-1(3)(i)&lt;/ref&gt; and 30 or more employees (public employers).&lt;ref&gt;R.I. Pub. Laws § 28-48-1(3)(iii)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vermont]]: 10 or more employees (parental leave only)&lt;ref&gt;23 VSA § 471(4)&lt;/ref&gt; and 15 or more employees (family and medical leave).&lt;ref&gt;23 VSA § 471(3)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Washington (state)|Washington]]: 50 or more employees (FMLA reasons besides insured parental leave);&lt;ref&gt;RCW § 49.78.020(5)&lt;/ref&gt; all employers are required to provide insured parental leave.&lt;ref&gt;RCW § 49.86.010 (6)(a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RCW § 50.50.080(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]: 20 or more employees.&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Code § 32-516(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanded coverage===
The federal FMLA only applies to immediate family—parent, spouse, and child. The 2008 amendments to the FMLA for military family members extend the FMLA’s protection to next of kin and to adult children. The Department of Labor on June 22, 2010 clarified the definition of "son and daughter" under the FMLA "to ensure that an employee who assumes the role of caring for a child receives parental rights to family leave regardless of the legal or biological  relationship" and specifying that "an employee who intends to share in the parenting of a child with his or her same sex partner will be able to exercise the right to FMLA leave to bond with that child."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US Department of Labor clarifies FMLA definition of ‘son and daughter’|url=http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/WHD/WHD20100877.htm|accessdate=2010-07-14|newspaper=U.S. Department of Labor|date=2010-06-22}}  News Release Number:  10-0877-NAT&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] issued its final rule amending the definition of spouse under the FMLA in response to the decision in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', effective March 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forman|first1=Shira|title=DOL Issues Final Rule Amending FMLA Definition of "Spouse" to Include Same-Sex Marriages|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dol-issues-final-rule-amending-fmla-definition-spouse-to-include-same-sex-marriages|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=Sheppard Mullin Richter &amp; Hampton LLP|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised definition of "spouse" extends FMLA leave rights and job protections to eligible employees in a [[same-sex marriage]] or a [[common-law marriage]] entered into in a state where those statuses are legally recognized, regardless of the state in which the employee works or resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trotier|first1=Geoffrey S.|title=FMLA "Spouse" Definition Now Includes Same-Sex Spouses and Common-Law Spouses|journal=The National Law Review|date=24 February 2015|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/fmla-spouse-definition-now-includes-same-sex-spouses-and-common-law-spouses|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=von Briesen &amp; Roper, s.c}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if an employee works where same-sex or common law marriage is not recognized, that employee's spouse triggers FMLA coverage if the employee married in a state that recognized same-sex marriage or common law marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gozdecki|first1=Jeanine M.|title=FMLA Final Rule: "Spouse" Means Same-Sex Spouse (Even in Alabama)|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/fmla-final-rule-spouse-means-same-sex-spouse-even-alabama|accessdate=28 February 2015|work=The National Law Review|publisher=Barnes &amp; Thornburg LLP|date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states had already expanded the definition of family in their own FMLAs:
* [[California]]: Domestic partner and domestic partner’s child.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Fam. Code § 297.5&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Connecticut]]: Civil union partner,&lt;ref&gt;Conn. Gen. Stat. § 46b-38nn&lt;/ref&gt; parent-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Conn. Gen. Stat. § 31-51kk (7)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hawaii]]: Grandparent, parent-in-law, grandparent-in-law&lt;ref&gt;Haw. Rev. Stat. § 398.1&lt;/ref&gt; or an employee's reciprocal beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;Haw. Rev. Stat. § 398.3&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maine: Domestic partner and domestic partner’s child,&lt;ref&gt;26 ME. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 843 (4)(D)&lt;/ref&gt; siblings.&lt;ref&gt;LD 2132&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Maryland]]: Allows the employee to use time for immediate family under the same rules if taking it for themselves. Includes step, adopted and even people who were primary caregivers even if not related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2009rs/bills_noln/sb/tsb0562.pdf |title=SENATE BILL 562 |publisher= |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New Jersey]]: Civil union partner and child of civil union partner,&lt;ref&gt;N.J. Stat. Ann. § 37:1-31&lt;/ref&gt; parent-in-law, step parent.&lt;ref&gt;N.J. Stat Ann. § 34-11B(3)(h)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oregon: Domestic partner,&lt;ref&gt;HB 2007&lt;/ref&gt; grandparent, grandchild or parent-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;OR. Rev. Stat. § 659A.150 (4)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rhode Island: Domestic partners of state employees, parent-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;R.I. Pub. Laws § 24-48-1(5)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vermont: Civil union partner,&lt;ref&gt;23 VSA § 1204(a)&lt;/ref&gt; parent-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;23 VSA § 471(3)(B)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wisconsin]]: Parent-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Wis. Stat. §103.10(1)(f)&lt;/ref&gt;
* District of Columbia: Related to the worker by blood, legal custody, or marriage; person with whom the employee lives and has a committed relationship; child who lives with employee and for whom employee permanently assumes and discharges parental responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Code 32-501(A), (B), (C)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasing the uses for FMLA leave===
FMLA leave can be used for a worker’s serious health condition, the serious health condition of a family member, or upon the arrival of a new child. State FMLA laws and the new military family provisions of the FMLA have broadened these categories:
* Connecticut: Organ or bone marrow donor.&lt;ref&gt;Conn. Gen. Stat. § 31-51ll (2)(E)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maine: Organ donor;&lt;ref&gt;26 ME. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 843 (4)(E)&lt;/ref&gt; death of employee’s family member if that family member is a servicemember killed while on active duty.&lt;ref&gt;26 ME. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 843 (4)(F)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maryland: Maryland Family Leave Act (MFLA) – Organ donor, Person Standing in Loco Parentis, For Service Leave, and added a specific anti-retaliation penalty on top of FMLA recovery. Runs parallel to FMLA.
* Oregon: Care for the non-serious injury or illness of a child requiring home care.&lt;ref&gt;OR. Rev. Stat. § 659A.159 (d)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unpaid leave for other related purposes===
Several states have passed FMLA-type statutes to give parents unpaid leave for other related purposes, including:
* Attending child’s school or educational activities. Examples include California,&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Lab. Code § 230.8&lt;/ref&gt; District of Columbia,&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Code 32-1202&lt;/ref&gt; Massachusetts,&lt;ref&gt;Mass. Gen. Laws. Ch. 149 § 52(D)(b)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; Minnesota,&lt;ref&gt;Minn. Stat. § 181.9412&lt;/ref&gt; Rhode Island,&lt;ref&gt;R.I. Pub. Laws § 24-48-12&lt;/ref&gt; Vermont,&lt;ref&gt;23 VSA § 472a (a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; and others. 
* Taking family members to routine medical visits. Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;Mass. Gen. Laws. Ch. 149 § 52(D)(b)(2)&amp;(3)&lt;/ref&gt; and Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;23 VSA § 472a (a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Addressing the effects of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault. Examples include Colorado,&lt;ref&gt;Colo. Rev. Stat. § 24-34-402.7&lt;/ref&gt; Florida,&lt;ref&gt;FLA. STAT. § 741.313&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;Haw. Rev. Stat. § 378-72&lt;/ref&gt; and Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 180/1-180/45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
In 2003, Han and Waldfogel found that “only about 60% of private sector workers are covered” &lt;ref&gt;Han, W.-J. and Waldfogel, J. 2003. "Parental Leave: The Impact of Recent Legislation on Parents' Leave-Taking." ''Demography''. 40(1):191–200. p191 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt; due to the clause stipulating a minimum number of employees, and once the clause stipulating a minimum number of hours worked is added, only 46% of private sector workers are eligible for leave under the FMLA. In June 2007, the Department of Labor estimated that of 141.7 million workers in the United States, 94.4 million worked at FMLA-covered worksites, and 76.1 million were eligible for FMLA leave. Only eight to 17.1 percent of covered, eligible workers (or between 6.1 million and 13.0 million workers) took FMLA leave in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Family and Medical Leave Act Regulations: A Report on the Department of Labor’s Request for Information." 28 June 2007. Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division. ''Federal Register'', Vol. 72, No. 124. [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2007-06-28/html/07-3102.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 National Survey of Employers found no statistically significant difference between the proportion of small employers (79%) and large employers (82%) that offer full FMLA coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Galinsky, E., Bond, J., Sakai, K., Kim, S., Giuntoli, N. 2008. National study of employers. New York, NY: Families and Work Institute. [http://www.familiesandwork.org/site/research/reports/2008nse.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much of the research has been conducted on populations in other countries,&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, P.E., Washbrook et al. 2005. "The Effects of a Mother's Return to Work Decision on Child Development in the UK." ''The Economic Journal''. 115(501):F48-F80.&lt;/ref&gt; Berger et al.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, L.M., Hill, et al. 2005. "Maternity Leave, Early Maternal Employment and Child Health Development in the US." ''The Economic Journal''. 115(501):F29-F47.&lt;/ref&gt; found that children in the United States whose mothers return to work within the first 3 months after giving birth are less likely to be [[Breastfeeding|breastfed]], have all of their [[immunization]]s up to date (by 18 months), and receive all of their regular medical checkups; they are also more likely to exhibit behavioral problems by four years of age. Chatterji and Markowitz &lt;ref&gt;Chatterji, P. and Markowitz, S. 2005. "Does the Length of Maternity Leave Affect Mental Health." ''Southern Economic Journal''. 72(1):16–41.&lt;/ref&gt; also found an association between longer lengths of maternity leave and lesser incidence of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] among mothers.

Despite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free [[child care]] or [[day care]]. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsidize parents' costs.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. D Paquette, 'The enormous ambition of Hillary Clinton's child-care plan' (May 12, 2016) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/12/the-enormous-ambition-of-hillary-clintons-child-care-plan/ The Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Critics of the act have suggested that by mandating various forms of leave that are used more often by female than male employees, the Act, like the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, makes women more expensive to employ than men. They argue that employers will engage in subtle discrimination against women in the hiring process, discrimination which is much less obvious to detect than [[pregnancy discrimination]] against the already hired. Throughout history, gender discrimination towards women was common; certain laws were placed that would restrict a woman's option in choosing a working position, as well as, how many hours she could work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Deborah J.|year=2008|title=The Hidden Harms of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Gender-Neutral Versus Gender-Equal|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&amp;context=jgspl|journal=Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law|volume=16|pages=4|via=Digital Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; ei. Employers  Supporters counter that the act, in contrast to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, is aimed at both women and men, and is part of an overall strategy to encourage both men and women to take family-related leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/benefits-leave/fmla|title=FMLA (Family &amp; Medical Leave)|date=2015-12-09|work=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is based on the assumption that men will take advantage of the opportunity of unpaid leave at comparable rates to women. According to Grossman, there is no basis for this assumption upon the inception of the legislation and no evidence has been found today to support this assumption. Therefore, the employer incentive to prefer male employees is preserved despite the equal opportunity for both sexes to take leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Joanna|date=20 April 2004|title=Job Security Without Equality: The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993|journal=Journal of Law and Policy|volume=15|issue=17|pages=17–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the FMLA is  much less comprehensive than Western European leave policies. Namely, the United States is the only industrialized country without paid leave for parents. The following table illustrates the lack of provisions offered in the United States as compared to that of other industrialized countries. For instance, all Western European nations have maternity paid leave and over half have paternity and sick child care paid leave, while the United States has no paid leave.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pyle|first=Jean|last2=Pelletier|first2=Marianne|date=1 March 2003|title=Family and Medical Leave Act: Unresolved Issues|department=Department of Regional Economic and Social Development|journal=|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, workplace fairness has been questioned under the Act. For instance, any woman-specific benefits provided by the legislation were considered special treatment and thus unacceptable, and ignoring the idea that women may have a greater share of burden of caregiving in reality. In retort, supporters may argue that creating such legislation that recognizes the female’s greater role in child care,  stereotype would be reinforced.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|last2=Deborah|date=2008|title=The Hidden Harms of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Gender Neutral versus Gender Equal|journal=Journal of Gender Social Policy and the Law|volume=16|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the implementation of the policy is also controversial because it is questioned whether the policy is actually going to those who need the benefits. For instance, since the leave offered is unpaid, majorities of eligible employees can not take time off because they can not afford to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mory|first=Marc|last2=Pistilli|first2=Lia|date=2001|title=The Failure of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Alternative Proposals for Contemporary American Families|journal=Hofstra Labor and Employment Law Journal|volume=18|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; And according to Pyle and Pelletier, eligible workers may not even know about this policy and the benefits allotted to them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Under law, women are protected from sex discrimination in the workplace but a large stigma against women still exists in terms of them being equally skilled as their male co-workers, and ultimately testing the federal protection of rights in a work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.workplacefairness.org/sexual-gender-discrimination#1|title=Sex / Gender Discrimination - Workplace Fairness|last=742-9150|first=Midwest New Media, LLC - http://www.midwestnewmedia.com - (513)|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405172256/http://www.workplacefairness.org/sexual-gender-discrimination#1|archive-date=2017-04-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any other federal regulation, it is strictly prohibited for an employer to discriminate towards an employee (especially if the employee is using their FMLA rights), and to strain from providing accurate information for all employees to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/fmlaAmended.htm#SEC_105_PROHIBITED_ACTS|title=U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division (WHD) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended|website=www.dol.gov|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
'''Hindu law''', as a historical term, refers to the code of laws applied to [[Hindu]]s, [[Buddhist]]s, [[Jain]]s and [[Sikh]]s in [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;William Musyoka (2010), A Casebook on the Law of Succession, {{ISBN|978-9966744852}}, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rocherresponse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner Menski (2003), Hindu Law: Beyond tradition and modernity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-569921-0}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu law, in modern scholarship, also refers to the legal theory, jurisprudence and philosophical reflections on the nature of law discovered in ancient and medieval era Indian texts.&lt;ref name=donalddavisjuris/&gt; It is one of the oldest known jurisprudence theories in the world.&lt;ref name=donalddavisjuris/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnmayne/&gt;

Hindu tradition, in its surviving ancient texts, does not express the law in the canonical sense of ''[[Ius (canon law)|ius]]'' or of ''[[Lex (canon law)|lex]]''.&lt;ref name=ludorocherhcl/&gt; The ancient term in Indian texts is [[Dharma]], which means more than a code of law.&lt;ref name=artidhand/&gt;&lt;ref name=larivierelaw/&gt; The term "Hindu law" is a colonial construction,&lt;ref&gt;P Bilimoria (2011), [http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=377009149672171;res=IELHSS The Idea of Hindu Law], Journal of the Oriental Society of Australia, Volume 43, pages 103-130&lt;/ref&gt; and emerged after the colonial rule arrived in South Asia, and when in 1772 it was decided by British colonial officials, that European common law system would not be implemented in India, that Hindus of India would be ruled under their "Hindu law" and Muslims of India would be ruled under "Muslim law" ([[Sharia]]).&lt;ref name=ludorocherhcl&gt;Ludo Rocher (1978), Hindu Conceptions of Law, Hastings Law Journal, Volume 29, pages 1283-1297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M Gaborieau 1985 pages 7-14"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marc Gaborieau |date=June 1985 |title=From Al-Beruni to Jinnah: Idiom, Ritual and Ideology of the Hindu-Muslim Confrontation in South Asia |journal=Anthropology Today |publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=7–14 |doi=10.2307/3033123 |jstor=3033123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the British colonial rule, Muslim law was codified as ''[[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]]'', but laws for non-Muslims – such as Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis – were not codified during the 601 years of Islamic rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Richard W. Lariviere |date=November 1989 |title=Justices and Paṇḍitas: Some Ironies in Contemporary Readings of the Hindu Legal Past |journal=Journal of Asian Studies |publisher=Association for Asian Studies |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=757–769 |jstor=2058113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substance of Hindu law implemented by the British was derived from a [[Dharmaśāstra]] named [[Manusmriti]], one of the many treatises ([[śāstra]]) on ''[[Dharma]]''.&lt;ref name=donalddavis/&gt; The British, however, mistook the Dharmaśāstra as codes of law and failed to recognise that these Sanskrit texts were not used as statements of positive law until the British colonial officials chose to do so.&lt;ref name=ludorocherhcl/&gt;&lt;ref name=donalddavis&gt;Donald Davis (2010), The Spirit of Hindu Law, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521877046}}, page 13-16, 166-179&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Dharmaśāstra contained jurisprudence commentary, i.e., a theoretical reflection upon practical law, but not a statement of the law of the land as such.&lt;ref&gt;For reviews of the British misappropriations of Dharmaśāstra, see: Richard W. Lariviere, "Justices and Paṇḍitas: Some Ironies in Contemporary Readings of the Hindu Legal Past," in ''Journal of Asian Studies'' 48 (1989), pp. 757–769, and Ludo Rocher, "Law Books in an Oral Culture: The Indian Dharmaśāstras," ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 137 (1993), pp. 254–267.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have also questioned the authenticity and the corruption in the Manusmriti manuscript used to derive the colonial era Hindu law.&lt;ref name=terenceday22/&gt;

In colonial history context, the construction and implementation of Hindu law and Islamic law was an attempt at "legal pluralism" during the British colonial era, where people in the same region were subjected to different civil and criminal laws based on the religion of the plaintiff and defendant.&lt;ref name=rudolphpq/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Griffith (1986), What is legal pluralism?, The Journal of Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law, Volume 18, Issue 24, pages 1-55&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholars state that this divided the Indian society, and that Indian law and politics have ever since vacillated between "legal pluralism - the notion that religion is the basic unit of society and different religions must have different legal rights and obligations" and "legal universalism – the notion that individuals are the basic unit of society and all citizens must have uniform legal rights and obligations".&lt;ref name=rudolphpq/&gt;

== Terminology and nomenclature ==
{{main|Dharma}}
In [[Hinduism]], law is discussed as a subset of ''dharma'' which signifies behaviors that are considered in accord with ''[[rta]]'', the order that makes life and universe possible,&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="ODWR-Dharma"|The [[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]]: "In Hinduism, dharma is a fundamental concept, referring to the order and custom which make life and a universe possible, and thus to the behaviours appropriate to the maintenance of that order."&lt;ref name="ODWR-Dharma"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/dharma.aspx#1 The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, ''Dharma'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and ‘‘right way of living’’.&lt;ref name=artidhand&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dhand|first=Arti|title=The Dharma of Ethics, the Ethics of Dharma : Quizzing the Ideals of Hinduism|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics|date=Fall 2002|volume=30|issue=3|page=351|doi=10.1111/1467-9795.00113}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 May 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dharma, The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th Ed.

In ancient texts of Hinduism, the concept of dharma incorporates the principles of law, order, harmony, and truth. It is explained as the necessary law of life and equated to ''[[satya]]'' (Sanskrit: सत्यं, truth),&lt;ref name=chjo/&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh/&gt; in hymn 1.4.14 of Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, as follows:

== Classical Hindu law ==
{{main|Classical Hindu law}}
John Mayne, in 1910, wrote that the classical Hindu law has the oldest pedigree of any known system of [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name=johnmayne&gt;John Dawson Mayne (1910), {{Google books|FwsTAAAAYAAJ|A Treatise on Hindu Law and Usage}}, Stevens and Hynes, Harvard Law Library Series, see Preface section&lt;/ref&gt; Mayne noted that while being ancient, the conflicting texts on almost every question presents a great difficulty in deciding what the classical Hindu law was. As more literature emerges, and is translated or interpreted, Mayne noted that the conflict between the texts on every matter of law has multiplied, and that there is a lack of consensus between the Western legal scholars resident in India.&lt;ref name=johnmayne/&gt;

Ludo Rocher states that Hindu tradition does not express law in the sense of ''ius'' nor of ''lex''.&lt;ref name=ludorocherhcl/&gt; The term "Hindu law" is a colonial construction, and emerged when the colonial rule arrived in South Asia, and when in 1772 it was decided by British colonial officials in consultation with Mughal rulers, that European common law system would not be implemented in India, that Hindus of India would be ruled under their "Hindu law" and Muslims of India would be ruled under sharia (Muslim law).&lt;ref name="ludorocherhcl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M Gaborieau 1985 pages 7-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rudolphpq&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Susanne Hoeber Rudolph |author2=Lloyd I. Rudolph |date=August 2000 |title=Living with Difference in India |journal=The Political Quarterly |publisher=Wiley |volume=71 |issue=s1 |pages=20–38 |doi=10.1111/1467-923X.71.s1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hindu law were neither mentioned, nor in use, nor codified, during the 600 years of Islamic rule of India. An attempt was then to find any old surviving Sanskrit text that mentioned elements of law, and this is how Western editors and translators arrived at the equation that "dharma shastra equals lawbook, code or Institute", states Rocher.&lt;ref name=ludorocherhcl/&gt;

Scholars such as Derrett, Menski and others have repeatedly asked whether and what evidence there is that the Dharmasastras were the actual legal authority before and during the Islamic rule in India?&lt;ref&gt;Werner Menski (2003), Hindu Law: Beyond tradition and modernity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195699210}}, pages 547-549&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JDM Derrett (1999), Law Religion and the State in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0571084784}}, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; They have also questioned whether the Dharmasastras contain "precepts" or "recommendations", that is whether the jurisprudence mentioned in Dharmasastras was actually ever used in disputes in Indian society?&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Voyce (2010), Law and Anthropology: Current Legal Issues (Editors: Freeman and Napier), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199580910}}, page 554 with footnote 27&lt;/ref&gt; Early scholars during the British colonial rule such as John Mayne suggested that it is probable that Dharma-smriti text reflect the "practical administration of law", at least before the arrival of Islam in India.&lt;ref name=johnmayne/&gt;&lt;ref name=axelmichaels&gt;Axel Michaels (2010), Hinduism and Law: An Introduction (Editors: Lubin and Davis), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521716260}}, Chapter 3 and pages 58-73 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; However, most later scholars state that Dharma texts of  Hinduism are "purely or mostly concerned with moral and religious norms which have some but not a very close relationship to legal practice".&lt;ref name=axelmichaels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Davis (2010), The Spirit of Hindu Law, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521877046}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few scholars have suggested that the Dharma-related Smritis such as Manusmriti, Naradasmriti and Parashara Smriti do not embody the Hindu law but are commentaries and scholarly notes on more ancient authoritative legal texts that have been lost or yet to be found.&lt;ref name=axelmichaels/&gt;

Classical Hindu law, states Donald Davis, "represents one of the least known, yet most sophisticated traditions of legal theory and jurisprudence in world history. Hindu jurisprudential texts contain elaborate and careful philosophical reflections on the nature of law and religion. The nature of Hindu law as a tradition has been subject to some debate and some misunderstanding both within and especially outside of specialist circles."&lt;ref name=donalddavisjuris&gt;{{cite journal |author=Donald Davis Jr |date=August 2006 |title=A Realist View of Hindu Law |journal=Ratio Juris |publisher=Wiley |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=287–313 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9337.2006.00332.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South India, temples were intimately involved in the administration of law.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Davis, Jr., ''The Boundaries of Hindu Law: Tradition, Custom, and Politics in Medieval Kerala''.

''Śruti'' have been considered as the authority in the Hindu [[Dharma]].{{refn|group=note|name=elisa|Elisa Freschi (2012): The Vedas are not [[Deontological ethics|deontic]] authorities in absolute sense and may be disobeyed, but still recognized as an [[epistemology|epistemic]] authority in Hindu dharma;&lt;ref&gt;Elisa Freschi (2012), Duty, Language and Exegesis in Prabhakara Mimamsa, BRILL, {{ISBN|978-9004222601}}, page 62&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: This differentiation between epistemic and deontic authority is true for all Indian religions)}} The ''Smritis'', such as Manusmriti, Naradasmriti and Parashara Smriti, contribute to the exposition of the Hindu [[Dharma]] but are considered less authoritative than ''[[Śruti]]s'' (the Vedic corpus that includes early Upanishads).&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Smrti", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N–Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|9780823931798}}, pages 656 and 461&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|A Smriti is a derivative work, has less epistemic authority than the Vedas, and does not have any deontic authority in Hindu dharma.&lt;ref&gt;Tomothy Lubin (2010), Hinduism and Law: An Introduction (Editors: Lubin and Davis), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521716260}}, pages 137-143&lt;/ref&gt;}} The root texts of ancient Hindu jurisprudence and law are the ''Dharma-sūtras''.

The source of Dharma is the Veda, as well as the tradition [Smriti], and practice of those who know the Veda. – Gautama Dharma-sūtra 1.1-1.2

The Dharma is taught in each Veda, in accordance with which we will explain it. What is given in the tradition [Smriti] is the second, and the conventions of cultured people are the third. – Baudhayana Dharma-sūtra 1.1.1-1.1.4

The Dharma is set forth in the vedas and the Traditional Texts [Smriti]. When these do not address an issue, the practice of cultured people becomes authoritative. – Vāsiṣṭha Dharma-sūtra 1.4-1.5

As a source of ''Dharma'', only three of the four types of texts in the Vedas have behavioral precepts. Lingat notes (abridged),&lt;ref name=robertlingat/&gt;

{{Quote|
For the Hindu all belief takes its source and its justification in the Vedas [Śruti]. Consequently every rule of ''dharma'' must find its foundation in the Veda. Strictly speaking, the [[Samhitas]] do not even include a single precept which could be used directly as a rule of conduct. One can find there only references to usage which falls within the scope of ''dharma''. By contrast, the [[Brahmanas]], the [[Aranyakas]] and the [[Upanishads]] contain numerous precepts which propound rules governing behavior.
|Robert Lingat&lt;ref name=robertlingat&gt;Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520018983}}, pages 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bilimoria states the role of ''Shruti'' in Hindu Dharma has been inspired by "the belief in a higher natural cosmic order (''Rta'' succeeded later by the concept ''Dharma'') that regulates the universe and provides the basis for its growth, flourishing and sustenance – be that of the gods, human beings, animals and eco-formations".&lt;ref&gt;Bilimoria, Purushottama (2011), The idea of Hindu law, Journal of Oriental Society of Australia, Vol. 43, pages 103-130&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinson states that the role of ''Shruti'' and ''Smriti'' in Hindu law is as a source of guidance, and its tradition cultivates the principle that "the facts and circumstances of any particular case determine what is good or bad".&lt;ref name=davidlevinson/&gt; The later Hindu texts include fourfold sources of ''Dharma'', states Levinson, which include ''Atmanastushti'' (satisfaction of one's conscience), ''Sadachara'' (local norms of virtuous individuals), ''Smriti'' and ''Sruti''.&lt;ref name=davidlevinson&gt;Devid Levinson (2002), Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment, Volume 1, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-0761922582}}, page 829&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald R.

=== Lawyers in classical Hindu Law ===

While texts on ancient Hindu law have not survived, texts that confirm the existence of the institution of lawyers in ancient India have.&lt;ref name=ludolawyer/&gt; The Sanskrit text ''Vivadarnavasetu'', in Chapter 3, for example, states,
{{Quote|
If the plaintiff or defendant have any excuse for not attending the court, or for not pleading their own cause, or, on any other account, excuse themselves, they shall, at their own option, appoint a person as their lawyer; if the lawyer gains the suit, his principal also gains; if the lawyer is cast, his principal is cast also.

In a cause where the accusation is for murder, for a robbery, for adultery, for (...), the principals shall plead and answer in person; but a woman, a minor, an insane, or a person lacking [[Competence (law)|mental competency]] may be represented by a lawyer.

=== Punishment in classical Hindu Law ===

Ancient texts of the Hindu tradition formulate and articulate punishment.&lt;ref name=terenceday/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Dawson Mayne (1910), {{Google books|FwsTAAAAYAAJ|A Treatise on Hindu Law and Usage}}, Stevens and Hynes, Harvard Law Library Series&lt;/ref&gt; These texts from the last 2500 years, states Terence Day,&lt;ref name=terenceday&gt;Terence Day (1982), The Conception of Punishment in Early Indian Literature, Wilfrid Laurier University Press, {{ISBN|978-0919812154}}, pages 18-22&lt;/ref&gt; imply or recognize key elements in their theories of fair punishment: (1) the texts set a standard of Right, in order to define a violation that warrants punishment; (2) they discuss the possibility of a violation thereby defining a wrongdoing; (3) they discuss a theory of responsibility and assignability of a wrongdoing; (4) the texts discuss degrees of guilt, and therewith the form and severity of punishment must match the transgression; (5) they discuss approved and authorized forms of punishments and how these may be properly administered.&lt;ref name=terenceday/&gt; The goal of punishment, in Hindu law, has been retributive and reformative.&lt;ref&gt;KL Seshagiri Rao (1997), [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/flr66&amp;div=60&amp;id=&amp;page= Practitioners of Hindu Law: Ancient and Modern], Fordham Law Review, vol. 66, pages 1185-1191&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu law, states Sarkar, developed the theory of punishment from its foundational theory of what it believed was necessary for the prosperity of the individual and a collection of individuals, of state and non-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benoy Kumar Sarkar |date=March 1921 |title=The Hindu Theory of the State |journal=Political Science Quarterly |publisher=The Academy of Political Science |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=79–90 |doi=10.2307/2142662 |jstor=2142662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are wide variations in the statement of crime and associated punishment in different texts.&lt;ref&gt;Terence Day (1982), The Conception of Punishment in Early Indian Literature, Wilfrid Laurier University Press, {{ISBN|978-0919812154}}, Chapters 2 &amp; 3&lt;/ref&gt; Some texts, for example discuss punishment for crimes such as murder, without mentioning the gender, class or caste of the plaintiff or defendant, while some discuss and differentiate the crime based on gender, class or caste. It is unclear, states Terence Day, whether these were part of the original, because the stylistic, structural and substantive evidence such as inconsistencies between versions of different manuscripts of the same text suggest changes and corruption of the original texts.&lt;ref name=terenceday22&gt;Terence Day (1982), The Conception of Punishment in Early Indian Literature, Wilfrid Laurier University Press, {{ISBN|978-0919812154}}, pages 22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outside India ===

Ancient Hindu legal texts and traditions arrived in parts of Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Java, Bali, Malaysia, Thailand, and Burma) as trade grew and as part of a larger culture sharing in ancient Asia.&lt;ref&gt;MB Hooker (1978), The Indian-derived law texts of Southeast Asia, The Journal of Asian Studies, volume 37, number 2, pages 201-219&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these regions, Hindu law fused with local norms and practices, giving rise to legal texts (Āgamas such as the Kuṭāra-Mānawa in Java, and the Buddhist-influenced Dhammasattas/Dhammathats of Burma and Thailand)&lt;ref&gt;Hooker 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as legal records embodied (as in India) in stone and copper-plate inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Creese 2009a, 2009b.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anglo-Hindu law ==
{{main|Anglo-Hindu law}}
In 18th century, the earliest British of the East India Company acted as agents of the Mughal emperor. As the British colonial rule took over the political and administrative powers in India, it was faced with various state responsibilities such as legislative and judiciary functions.&lt;ref name=timlubin&gt;Tomothy Lubin et al (2010), Hinduism and Law: An Introduction (Editors: Lubin and Davis), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521716260}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; The East India Company, and later the British Crown, sought profits for its British shareholders through trade as well as sought to maintain effective political control with minimal military engagement.&lt;ref name=dawashbrook/&gt; The administration pursued a path of least resistance, relying upon co-opted local intermediaries that were mostly Muslims and some Hindus in various princely states.&lt;ref name=dawashbrook/&gt; The British exercised power by avoiding interference and adapting to law practices as explained by the local intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Kugle (2001), Framed, Blamed and Renamed: The Recasting of Islamic Jurisprudence in Colonial South Asia, Modern Asian Studies, 35(2), pages 257-313&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial state thus sustained what were essentially pre-colonial religious and political law and conflicts, well into the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=timlubin/&gt;&lt;ref name=dawashbrook&gt;{{cite journal |last=Washbrook |first=D.

{{Quote|

|[[Warren Hastings]]|August 15, 1772&lt;ref name=rocherresponse/&gt;}}
For Muslims of India, the code of Muslim law was readily available in al-Hidaya and Fatawa-i Alamgiri written under sponsorship of Aurangzeb. For Hindus and other non-Muslims such as Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Tribal people, this information was unavailable.&lt;ref name=timlubin/&gt; The British colonial officials, for practice, attempted to extract from the Dharmaśāstra, the English categories of law and religion for the purposes of colonial administration.&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher, "Hindu Law and Religion: Where to draw the line?" in ''Malik Ram Felicitation Volume''. ed. S.A.J. Zaidi (New Delhi, 1972), 190–1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.D.M. Derrett, ''Religion, Law, and the State in India'' (London: Faber, 1968), 96; For a related distinction between religious and secular law in Dharmaśāstra, see Timothy Lubin, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1084716 "Punishment and Expiation: Overlapping Domains in Brahmanical Law,"] ''Indologica Taurinensia'' 33 (2007): 93–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early period of [[Anglo-Hindu Law]] (1772–1828) was structured along the lines of Muslim law practice. It included the extracted portions of law from one Dharmaśāstra by British colonial government appointed scholars (especially Jones, [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]], Sutherland, and Borrodaile) in a manner similar to Islamic al-Hidaya and Fatawa-i Alamgiri.&lt;ref&gt;K Ewing (1988), Sharia and ambiguity in South Asian Islam, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520055759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n7/mode/2up A digest of Moohummudan law on the subjects to which it is usually applied by British courts of justice in India] Neil Baillie, Smith, Elder &amp; Co. London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=michaelanderson&gt;Michael Anderson (1995), Institutions and Ideologies: A SOAS South Asia Reader (Studies in Asian Topics, Editors: David Arnold, Peter Robb), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700702848}}, Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; It also included the use of court [[pandit]]s in British courts to aid British judges in interpreting Shastras just like [[Qadi]]s (Maulavis) for interpreting the Islamic law.&lt;ref name=michaelanderson/&gt;

The arrival of [[Lord William Bentinck|William Bentinck]] as the Governor-General of British India in 1828, marked a shift towards universal civil code, whose administration emphasized same law for all human beings, individualism and equal treatment to help liberate, empower and end social practices among Hindus and Muslims of India that had received much public coverage in Britain through the publications of Christian missionaries and individuals such as [[Thomas Macaulay]].&lt;ref name=rudolphpq/&gt;

[[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Governor-General Dalhousie]], in 1848, extended this trend and stated his policy that the law must "treat all natives much the same manner". Over  time, between 1828-1855, a series of British parliamentary acts were passed to revise the Anglo-Hindu and Anglo-Muslim laws, such as those relating to the right to religious conversion, widow remarriage, and right to create wills for inheritance.&lt;ref name=rudolphpq/&gt; In 1832, the British colonial government abolished accepting religious [[fatwa]] as a source of law.&lt;ref name=akgiri/&gt; In 1835, the British began creating a criminal code that would replace the existing criminal code which was a complex conflicting mixture of laws derived from Muslim texts (Quran) and Hindu texts (Shastras), and this common criminal code was ready by 1855.&lt;ref name=akgiri/&gt; These changes were welcomed by Hindu law reform movement, but considered abrogating religion-defined rules within the Muslim law. The changes triggered discontent, call for jihad and religious war, and became partly responsible for the 1857 Indian revolt against the British rule.&lt;ref&gt;Rosie Llewellyn-Jones (2007), The Great Uprising in India: 1857-58, Boydell &amp; Brewer, {{ISBN|978-1843833048}}, pages 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Cook (2005), Understanding Jihad, University of California Press, ISBN, pages 80-83&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, after the East India Company was dissolved and India became a formal part of the [[British Empire]], Anglo-Hindu law entered into a second phase (1864–1947), one in which British colonial courts in India relied less on the Muslim Qadis and Hindu Pandits for determining the respective religious laws, and relied more on a written law.&lt;ref name=rudolphpq/&gt; A universal criminal code in India, that did not discriminate between people based on their religion, was adopted for the first time in 1864.&lt;ref name=akgiri/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JDM Derrett (1968), Religion, Law and State in India, Faber and Faber, London, {{ISBN|978-0571087327}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was expanded to include a universal procedural and commercial code by 1882, which overruled pre-existing Anglo-Hindu and Anglo-Muslim laws.&lt;ref name=akgiri&gt;AK Giri (Editors: Pietro Costa and Danilo Zolo, 2007), The Rule of Law History: Theory and Criticism, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1402057441}}, pages 596-597&lt;/ref&gt; However, the personal laws for Muslims remained sharia-based, while the Anglo-Hindu law was enacted independent of any text on matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance and the Anglo-Hindu law covered all Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists in India.&lt;ref&gt;Kunal Parker (Editor: Gerald James Larson, 2001), Religion and Personal Law in Secular India: A Call to Judgment, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-33990-1}}, pages 184-199&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the British crown enacted the Indian Christian Marriage Act which covered marriage, divorce and alimony laws for Indian Christians of all denominations except the Roman Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Chandra Mallampalli (2004), Christians and Public Life in Colonial South India: 1863-1937, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-32321-5}}, pages 59-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of legal pluralism, that is separate law based on individual's religion was controversial in [[India]], from the very start.&lt;ref name=rocherresponse&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ludo Rocher |date=July–September 1972 |title=Indian Response to Anglo-Hindu Law |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=419–424 |doi=10.2307/600567  |jstor=600567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Hindu law ==
{{main|Modern Hindu law}}

After the independence of India from the colonial rule of Britain in 1947, India adopted a new constitution in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Seshagiri Rao, K.L. (1997–1998). Practitioners of Hindu Law: Ancient and Modern. Fordham Law Review, 66, Retrieved 15 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the legal code from the colonial era continued as the law of the new nation, including the personal laws contained in Anglo-Hindu law for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs, the Anglo-Christian law for Christians, and the Anglo-Muslim law for Muslims. Article 44 of the 1950 Indian constitution mandates a uniform civil code, eliminating all religion-based civil laws including Hindu law, Christian law and Muslim law throughout the territory of India.&lt;ref name=sahmed/&gt; However, while Hindu law has since been amended to be independent of ancient religious texts, the Article 44 of the Indian constitution has remained largely ignored in matters of Muslim law, by successive Indian governments since 1950.&lt;ref name=sahmed&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shabbeer Ahmed |date=July–September 2006 |title=Uniform Civil Code (Article 44 of the Constitution) A Dead Letter |journal=The Indian Journal of Political Science |publisher=Indian Political Science Association |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=545–552 |jstor=41856241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=derrettmodernhindulaw/&gt;

An amendment to the constitution (42nd Amendment, 1976) formally inserted the word ''secular'' as a feature of the Indian republic.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Pritam. 2005. "Hindu Bias in India's 'Secular' Constitution: probing flaws in the instruments of governance." ''Third World Quarterly.'' 26:6, 909–926.&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the Western concept of [[secularism]] which separates religion and state, the concept of secularism in India means acceptance of [[religious law]]s as binding on the state, and equal participation of state in different religions.&lt;ref&gt;Donald E Smith (2011), India as a Secular State, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|9781178595253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Larson&gt;Gerald James Larson (2001), Religion and Personal Law in Secular India: A Call to Judgment, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-33990-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1950s, India has debated whether legal pluralism should be replaced with legal universalism and a uniform civil code that does not differentiate between people based on their religion. This debate remains unresolved. The Quran-based Indian Muslim Personal Law ([[Sharia]]t) Application Act of 1937 remains the law of land of modern India for Indian Muslims, while parliament-based, non-religious uniform civil code passed in mid-1950s applies to Indians who are Hindus (which includes Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsees), as well as to Indian Christians and Jews.&lt;ref name=Larson/&gt; In 1955, India revised its Hindu Marriage Act and it applied to all Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs; scholars contest whether the law applies to cases where the either the husband or wife is Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh, and the other is a Christian or Muslim.&lt;ref name=derrettmodernhindulaw&gt;JDM Derrett (1978), Essays in Classical and Modern Hindu Law, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004057531}}, pages 68-75&lt;/ref&gt;

This article deals primarily with the nature of '''Italian citizenship''' from the time of unification to the present. It is concerned with the civil, political, and social rights and obligations of Italian nationals and addresses how these rights and obligations have been changed or manipulated throughout the last two centuries.

== Italian national identity before 1861 ==
In the Middle Ages, the [[Italian peninsula]] was split into five large and small sovereign states that were subsequently subdivided into several smaller, semi-autonomous, mini-states.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Absalom, ''Italy Since 1800 A Nation in the Balance?'' (Harlow: Longman, 1995), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 19th century, Napoleonic conquests resulted in French control over most of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Absalom., 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

This 14-year period of Napoleonic rule is substantial to Italian self-recognition, because the administration of the French influenced Italians into entertaining the idea of a constituted Italian nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Absalom., 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The repressive nature of this era also acted to engender a new generation of Italian national revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Absalom., 21.&lt;/ref&gt; One of which was [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], known as a founder of the ''[[Risorgimento]]''. Mazzini saw Italian nationality as inclusive: “For Mazzini, all Italians, irrespective of class and property, were impoverished and oppressed, and all were therefore included in his noton of 'the people'”&lt;ref&gt;Absalom., 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concept of nationality during unification ===

The key figure in the independence and initial unification of Italy was [[Count Camillo Benso di Cavour]].&lt;ref&gt;Absalom., 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavour wanted to create a modern secular state but without the characteristic social upheaval of revolution. Cavour and his supporters decided this could be done by limiting popular participation and unifying Italy with the consent of the Major Powers. Cavour also wished to limit enfranchisement, within the new Italy, to "men of substance."&lt;ref&gt;Absalom., 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavour thought it most practical to control the definition of Italian Nationality, as well as the politics of the Italian Nation, from the top down.

==First constitution==
The first Italian constitution was created through the adaptation of the Piedmontese ''[[Statuto Albertino]]'' of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;John A Hawgood. ''Modern constitutions since 1787'' (Littleton, Colorado: Fred B. Rothman and co, 1987),171.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the Statuto were either copied from the French constitutional charter of 1840 or the Spanish constitution of 1812.  The Piedmontese ''Statuto'' was originally drafted in French.&lt;ref&gt;Hawgood.,171.&lt;/ref&gt; To this day the statute remains officially un-repealed in Italy, though it is not used in present-day practice &lt;ref&gt;Hawgood.,172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Italian Unification==

=== Storica’s ===

====1860-1876====
The ''Destra Storica'' (Historical Right) completed the territorial unification of Italy, centralized its administration, and established an effective system of tax collection. It was repressive of popular movements, but respected the liberties of individuals, to think, speak, and write.&lt;ref&gt;Absalom., 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1876-1898====
The ''Sinistra Storica'' (Historical Left) replaced the Destra Storica parliament. This period was characterized by low levels of enfranchisement among nationals.  Less than 2% of the population was entitled to vote, until 1882 when the figure rose to 7%. There were only half a million male voters, and these were mostly dominated by a few thousand influential figures.&lt;ref&gt;Absalom., 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Giovanni Giolitti and voter expansion ===
Following the fall of the Sinistra Storica parliament, Italian national politics were firmly controlled by [[Giovanni Giolitti]]; his position in government remained predominant from 1903 to 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Gentile, ''The Struggle For Modernity Nationalism Futurism and Fascism'' (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Giolitti’s regime most notably created a major electoral reform law, which increased voters from 3 million to 8.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Absalom., 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous to Giollitti, in 1882, the number of enfranchised was limited because there was an educational test for voters.&lt;ref name="Hawgood.,177"&gt;Hawgood.,177.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers, sailors, and police officers also were, oddly enough, excluded from enfranchisement.&lt;ref name="Hawgood.,177"/&gt; Under Giolitti, however, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] decided to hesitantly support the Italian state; finally making it possible for “good Catholics” to vote in elections, following 1903. This combined with increasing literacy led to 30% of the male adult population becoming eligible to vote in national elections. [[Universal manhood suffrage]] followed later, in 1912.&lt;ref name="Hawgood.,177"/&gt; In 1919 illiterate voters, who comprised about 50% of the population, were able to take part in elections by depositing unmarked ballot papers bearing their party emblem into the ballot box.&lt;ref&gt;Hawgood,178.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italian fascist conceptualization of nationality ==

=== ''La Voce'' ===

The nationalism of la Voce came to fruition under the authoritative Giolitti government. The movement is considered to be influential on, although not directly related to, the development of fascism. The greatest contrast between the thoughts of La Voce and the ideology of fascism occurs in the la voce belief that the myth of regeneration of politics was not associated with the myth of the supremacy of the state, nation, and race. In contrast, the Vociani wanted national regeneration through [[civic humanism]] and the faith of a [[secular religion]] that could “educate the moral conscience for the modern ‘New Italian’ harmonizing the need for a strong sense of national identity with the aspiration of attaining a higher universal conscience, above and beyond that of nationalism.”&lt;ref&gt;Gentile., 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fascist conception of nationality ===
[[Futurism]] and the La Voce movement eventually would come together to lay a foundation for the creation of [[Italian Fascism]]; in which the status of the national would be redefined yet again.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile.,41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist’s ideal citizen was a “new man” devoid of any individual autonomy and responsibility who was taught to see himself merely as an instrument of the state. This “new man” also had to be prepared to sacrifice his life for his nation.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile., 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian [[National Fascist Party]], or PNF, achieved this through sanctifying politics, “integrating the masses into the nation through the use of faith based rituals and symbols centered on a new fascist religion.”&lt;ref&gt;Gentile., 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Fascists also claimed a monopoly over the representation of “Italianness”; an Italian national was defined by his participation in the PNF.&lt;ref name="Gentile., 146"&gt;Gentile., 146.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the liberal nationalist ideal which incorporated all Italians into the state; despite religion, ethnicity or ideology, was swept away by the totalitarian state ideal. Only Fascists were considered "True Italians" and only these individuals were granted a "Complete Citizenship." Those who did not swear allegiance to the Fascist party were banned from public life.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile., 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The PNF also initiated a large propaganda program engendering [[Italians|Italian]] identity to Italian emigrants and nationals abroad; in the hopes of promoting the fascist cause among former nationals through the promotion of a fascist version of [[Italian nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Gentile., 146"/&gt;

=== Fascist syndicate system ===
The Fascist party, between 1926 and 1928, created a corporative system of representation and negotiation where equality between citizens was rejected (made official in the Charter of Labor of 1927) and citizens were arranged based on economic categorization within syndicates.&lt;ref&gt;Hawgood.,420.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rights of individuals were, therefore, superseded by the rights of the syndicate. Each employer and employee were merged to form a labor syndicate that was placed into one of six larger national categories; for national representation. Intellectual workers were placed in a special category.&lt;ref name="Hawgood.,421"&gt;Hawgood.,421.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was within the syndicates that requests for improved working conditions and higher wages were petitioned and decided upon with the state acting only as the final judge.&lt;ref name="Hawgood.,421"/&gt; In order to join a work syndicate one had to pay dues to the syndicate and become a member of the Fascist Party. The national electorate was adapted to this new system so all voters were now, under fascism, male Italian citizens over the age of twenty one who belonged to a syndicate and were members of the fascist party.&lt;ref name="Hawgood.,422"&gt;Hawgood.,422.&lt;/ref&gt; A citizen’s power to vote, therefore, was granted based on the fulfillment of a social function. Belonging to a syndicate provided evidence of an individual’s contribution to the state while simultaneously, through obligation in membership, made sure that all voting citizens were members of the Fascist Party.&lt;ref name="Hawgood.,422"/&gt;

== Others and Fascist discrimination ==

=== Venezia Giulia ===
As a result of First World War peace process, Italy was forced to incorporate Slovene and Croatian-speaking sections of the [[Habsburg]] Empire into Italy. This new region was referred to as “Venezia Giulia.” Under fascist rule this north eastern border was specifically targeted for the violent enforcement of an Italian national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock, Bruce ed. and Bedani, Gino Ed. ''The Politics of Italian a Multidisciplinary Perspective'' (Gwenyth Street, Cardiff, 2000)163.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, harsh assimilatory treatment of minorities in the area existed months before fascists marched on parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock., 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous to fascist control Slavs in the area were treated as an alien group and this categorization translated into specific anti-Slav policies prohibiting the use of Slovene language in government institutions and law courts.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock., 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Fascist takeover the legislative integration of Venezia Giulia into Italy began, which formally occurred in 1922.&lt;ref name="Haddock., 169"&gt;Haddock., 169.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1923 Topnomy laws reinvented the identities of these provinces; Slavic street names and monuments were changed to celebrate and promote Italian contemporary persons. By 1924 the integration of the Slavic community of Venezia Giulia was further intensified as all foreign language newspapers were required to publish Italian translations and schools were prohibited from teaching in foreign languages.&lt;ref name="Haddock., 169"/&gt; Assimilating policies, however, were most aggressive between the years 1924-1927. It was during these years that policies were formally put in place discriminating against Slavic Minorities. Examples include the transformation of 500 Slovene and Croatian primary schools into Italian language schools, as well as the deportation of one thousand Slavic teachers to other parts of Italy, and the formal closure of 500 Slav societies and a number of Slavic libraries. Slav surnames were also replaced by Italianized versions. Eventually all evidence of non-Italian names, even on old gravestones, were destroyed. Houses were searched for foreign language literature and alien cultural and athletic organizations were purged of non-Italian content. Finally land and property were confiscated from Slovene peasant farmers and redistributed to new Italian settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock., 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jewish exclusion under fascism ===
In November 1938 the Italian fascist government introduced laws aimed specifically against the Italian Jewish community. These laws prohibited all Jews, regardless of their political loyalty to fascism, from participating in schools, commerce, professions or politics. This exclusion was also actively used, during the last five years of the fascist government, in a propaganda program to educate the Italian population to the biological understanding of Italian national identity.&lt;ref name="Haddock., 178"&gt;Haddock., 178.&lt;/ref&gt; This propaganda campaign detailed the biological threat of Jews and other non-Europeans such as Africans to the purity of the Italian race.&lt;ref name="Haddock., 178"/&gt;

== Italy after fascism ==
The failure of fascism is often associated with the ruined prestige of the Italian national identity.&lt;ref name="Gentile.,185"&gt;Gentile.,185.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the fifties and sixties the loss of national prestige seems to have grown as some scholars presently maintain that Italian nationals have already lost, or are in the process of losing, their sense of national identity.&lt;ref name="Gentile.,185"/&gt; This loss of national identity can be witnessed in the present-day growth of Piccolo Patria (local patriotism); where national identity is being replaced by regional patriotism.&lt;ref name="Gentile.,186"&gt;Gentile.,186.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to divisive movements such as the separatist movement of the Northern League of Italy.&lt;ref name="Gentile.,186"/&gt;  However the strength of regional patriotism has also positively affected the ease with which Italian Nationals have entered the European Union. It is a popular paradox to say that “Italians are the most regional yet at the same time the most European” of all individuals within the EU.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The retention of a strong regional identity is seen as corresponding with a weaker notion of state and national identity. As a result, Italians are able to view participation in the EU as non-threatening to national consciousness in contrast to fellow Europeans; who place a greater importance on retaining a unique national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock.,109.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Italian constitutional distinctiveness ==
Italy’s ultimate law is found in its constitution, created in 1948 following the fascist downfall, where sovereignty belongs to citizens who elect a parliament. This Italian constitution is not original in its obligation to safeguard basic and fundamental human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert M. Kritzer, ed., ''Legal Systems of the World A Political and Cultural Encyclopedia Volume II.''(Santa Barbara, California: ABC CLIO: 2002), 763.&lt;/ref&gt; However the Italian constitution is distinctive in the sense that it formally guarantees, under article 24, the right to a judicial defense.&lt;ref name="Kritzer.,763"&gt;Kritzer.,763.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian constitution is also distinctive, from some other constitutions, in its outlawing of the death penalty, pursuant to article 27.&lt;ref name="Kritzer.,763"/&gt; This indicates that the state sees rehabilitation of a convicted person as an obligation; and rehabilitation through treatment as a right of the Italian citizen.&lt;ref name="Kritzer.,763"/&gt;

== Language rights and discrimination in Italian national history ==
The [[Italian language]] has been considered an important characteristic of Italian national identity since the time of unification. It was the overwhelming use of regional dialects and foreign languages that lead non-Italian speaking minorities to be considered a threat to the development of national consciousness. As a result of this the first eighty or ninety years of Italian history characterizes non-Italian speaking minorities as intruders in the national domain; who were to be given no official existence.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock., 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
This is significant once it is considered that the Italian state began its life in 1861 without a common language. Most of the population could not speak, what is today considered, Italian. Out of a population of 35 million at least 31 million were not included in the, not-so, common language.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock., 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the fascist regime came to power Italian still was the spoken language of very few Italian nationals. Fascists confronted this obstruction to national unity by discriminating and banning the use of foreign language forms. French and English were particularly singled out as polluting the Italian national language. As a result, laws were created aimed at preventing the use of foreign words on shop signs and Italian alternatives were created to take the place of regularly used foreign words.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock., 106.&lt;/ref&gt; This repression of foreign languages went so far as to prompt Fascist Party member [[Tommaso Tittoni]], on 16 August 1926 to call upon [[Benito Mussolini]] to send government representatives around newspaper offices to catch out and sack linguistic offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock., 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct result of this linguistic repression culminated in the development of a new constitutional law, included in the January 1 constitution of 1948, which carried a reference to linguistic equality. It stated that “all Italian citizens have equal social dignity and are equal before the law, without distinction of sex, race, language, religion, political opinions, personal, or social condition” and also that “the republic will protect linguistic minorities with appropriate measures.” &lt;ref&gt;Haddock., 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, and in complete contradiction to past trends, a multicultural approach to language rights has also developed as a proposed law on language was passed by Italian parliament on December 15, 1999. This law formally protected the use of thirteen minority languages for use in education, broadcasting and administration.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock., 98.&lt;/ref&gt;
The European Court of Justice has found Italian universities guilty of discrimination based on nationality - with regard to its non-Italian teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/3459949.stm Italy faces fines over teachers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allsi.org/allsi_about.html illegal mass discrimination based on nationality]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2013}}

== Civil Law ==
Italy has, since unification, invoked the use of two civil codes. The first was the [[Italian civil code|Italian Civil Code]] of 1865 which was used up until it was made obsolete by the second Italian Civil Code, which was formally created and put to use in 1942.

=== Italian Civil Code ===

====1865====
The [[Italian civil code|Italian Civil Code]] of 1865 was formally adopted by Italy following unification. The Civil Code of 1865 was  similar to the [[Napoleonic Code]]. The fundamental principles, of both the Napoleonic code and 1865 Italian Civil Code, indicated that all male citizens were equal before the law: primogeniture, hereditary nobility, and class privileges were to be extinguished; civilian institutions were to be emancipated from ecclesiastical control; and freedom of person, freedom of contract, and inviolability of private property were to be placed under the formal protection of Civil Law.&lt;ref&gt;"Napoleonic Code." Encyclopedia of Britannica Online. Available from http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9054824/Napoleonic-Code#54053.hook. Internet; accessed 27 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1942 ====
The modern Italian Civil Code contains 2969 articles and is divided into six books categorized under the headings Persons and Family, Succession, Property Obligations, Labor, and Protection of Rights. The Civil Code was adopted in 1942 whereas the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure have been formally used by Italy since 1931. However all of these codes have since been extensively amended and the Code of Criminal Procedure has undergone significant modification based on decisions made in the Italian Constitutional Court. In 1988 a new Code of Criminal Procedure was adopted in realization of the constitutional principles.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Robert, ed., ''Modern Legal Systems Cyclopedia Shlueter Volume Three Revised Country Studieshi'' (Buffalo, New York: William S. Hein &amp; Co. Law Publisher, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female exclusion from civil rights ===
Under the Civil Code of 1865 women were formally categorized based, almost exclusively, on the nature of their relationship with an Italian male. Women, as a result, as a group were denied the privilege of civil rights. Women were excluded from political and administrative suffrage, were not allowed to hold any public office, and barred from representing civil state authority. As a result of these limitations women were banned from holding several jobs and lacked access to certain privileges. For instance women, under the original civil code of 1865, were not allowed to become arbitrators, notaries, lawyers, judges, or guardians to individuals unless directly connected through blood. Over the process of time woman did gain civil rights equal to men, however, this was a long drawn out process. In 1919, women gained the right to own property and the right to control their income, while also being given access to a handful of legal positions. 26 years later, in 1945, women received the right to vote in elections. Finally, in 1975, reforms were introduced and enacted that brought about a legal change to the distribution of power between the sexes in marriage, which had formerly held an incredibly masculine bias.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Jeffrey Howard, “The Civil Code of 1865 and the Origins of the Feminist Movement in Italy”, in The Italian Immigrant Woman in North America, eds. Betty Boyd Caroli, Robert F. Harney and Lydio F. Thomasi (Toronto: The Multicultural History Society of Ontario, 1977),14-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citizenship ===
In the Italian Civil Code’s amended legislation of 1992 there are three types of citizens that are recognized as citizens at birth.
*The child of a citizen father or mother
*Those who were born in the territory of the Republic if both parents are unknown or stateless persons, or if the child does not follow the citizenship of the parents under the law of the State to which the parents belong.
*The child of unknown parents found in the territory of the Republic is considered a citizen by birth, unless possession of another citizenship is proved.

There is also a provision in Italian Civil Law which states that all adopted aliens automatically acquire citizenship&lt;ref&gt;Mario Beltramo, trans.,''The Italian Civil Code and Complementary Legislation: Appendix G New Rules on Citizenship.''(New, York New York: Oxford University Press, 2007),1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aliens ====
For the most part aliens residing in Italy can gain access to citizenship in one of four ways. The first is through engaging in active military service for the Italian state. The Second is by taking public employment from the state, within the republic or abroad. The third is by residing in the territory of the republic for at least two years prior to reaching majority and declaring, within one year of this date, that one wishes to acquire Italian Citizenship. The Fourth is through legally residing for at least 6 months in the territory of the republic before marrying an Italian citizen. This fourth kind of citizenship is lost however upon annulment, divorce, or legal separation. There are also certain provisions that bar an alien from attaining Italian citizenship upon marriage. These provisions are for the most part criminal misconduct. If the future wife or husband has committed a crime of considerable degree, or poses a threat to the nation at large, then they will be barred from formal entry.&lt;ref&gt;Beltramo, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Annulment ====
Italian citizenship is lost when a citizen is publicly or militarily in the employment of a foreign nation or international entity with which the Italian state refuses to acknowledge.  This loss of citizenship, however, is prefaced by a warning issued by the Italian state urging the Italian citizen to give up their public or military position within an allotted amount of time. During war-time this provision is made much more important as any citizen publicly, or militarily, employed within a state at odds with Italy is essentially forced to give up their citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Beltramo, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Infobox court case|name=Jandreau vs. Nicholson|image=|court=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]]|date decided=July 3, 2007|citations=492 F.3d 1372 (2007)|appealed from=[[United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims]]|Judges=Bryson and Dyk|ChiefJudge=Michel}}
Alva Jandreau served in the U.S. Army from May 1957 to May 1959. In 1997, the Veteran filed a claim for residuals of a right shoulder injury. He provided a statement that his right shoulder condition started while in [[basic training]], when he had [[Dislocated shoulder|dislocated his shoulder]]. He submitted numerous statements on his own behalf, including a statement from a fellow serviceman supporting his claim. He also submitted a medical report from a doctor that opined that his condition was "[r]ight shoulder pain, most likely sequelae of his dislocation of the shoulder." Lastly, he submitted medical reports showing a history of a right shoulder dislocation and pain.

The VA Regional Office denied the claim, citing that there was no evidence of continuity of symptomatology since service. The [[Board of Veterans' Appeals]] upheld the denial, reasoning that the report from his doctor simply transcribed Jandreau's own lay history. The Board also found that the statements provided by the Veteran and his fellow service member were not competent, as diagnosing a medical condition, it reasoned, is beyond the range of common experience and knowledge. The [[Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims]] ultimately affirmed the Board's decision, holding that competent medical evidence is required when the issue at hand deals with medical etiology or a medical diagnosis.

== Analysis ==
The Federal Circuit, relying on the holding of the [[Buchanan vs. Nicholson]] case, found that the Court had erred in its holding. In its analysis, it provided the following framework for when lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis:
# A layperson is competent to identify the medical condition,
# The layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or
# Lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional

== Decision ==
The decision was reversed and [[remanded]].

'''Jonathan Turley''' (born May 6, 1961) is an American lawyer, legal scholar, writer, commentator, and legal analyst in broadcast and print journalism.  He is currently a professor of law at the [[George Washington University Law School]].

==Education and personal life==
Turley was born in Chicago, Illinois. He received his bachelor's degree from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1983 and his [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Northwestern University School of Law]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=turley/&gt; He married his wife Leslie on [[New Year's Eve]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turley |first=Jonathan |date=December 31, 2013 |title=Happy New Year's Eve!!! |url=https://jonathanturley.org/2013/12/31/happy-new-years-eve-3/ |website=Jonathan Turley |access-date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as a House leadership page in 1977 and 1978 under the sponsorship of Illinois Democrat [[Sidney R. Yates|Sidney Yates]].&lt;ref name=yates&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-10-10/news/0010100245_1_hubert-h-humphrey-page-quiet-moments A Farewell To Sid Yates], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', October 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Law from [[John Marshall Law School (Atlanta)|John Marshall Law School]] in recognition of his career as an advocate of civil liberties and constitutional rights.&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;[http://www.jmls.edu/in_the_loop/previous/2008/01202008/index.shtml The John Marshall Law School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927220519/http://www.jmls.edu/in_the_loop/previous/2008/01202008/index.shtml |date=September 27, 2011 }}, January 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Turley lives in [[Washington, D.C.]], with his wife and four children.

==Career==
Turley holds the Shapiro Chair for Public Interest Law at The George Washington University Law School where he teaches [[torts]], [[criminal procedure]], and [[constitutional law]].  He is the youngest person to receive an academic chair in the school's history.  He runs the Project for Older Prisoners (POPS),&lt;ref name=pops&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-turley7oct07,0,243039.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions Release Elderly Inmates], by Jonathan Turley, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.gwu.edu/Academics/EL/clinics/Pages/POPS.aspx  George Washington University Law School, The Project for Older Prisoners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414143034/http://www.law.gwu.edu/Academics/EL/clinics/Pages/POPS.aspx |date=April 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Environmental Law Clinic, and the Environmental Legislation Project.&lt;ref name=turley/&gt;

Prior to joining the George Washington University, he was on the faculty of [[Tulane University Law School]].&lt;ref name=turley&gt;[http://www.law.gwu.edu/Faculty/profile.aspx?id=1738 George Washington University Law School, Jonathan Turley]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jonathan Turley.jpg|thumb|left|Testifying at the Supreme Court, 2007]]
His articles on legal and policy issues appear regularly in national publications; as of 2012, Turley has had articles published in newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/04/opinion/04turley.html Get Congress Out of the Page Business], by Jonathan Turley, ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref name=wapost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/09/AR2009040903155.html The Free World Bars Free Speech], by Jonathan Turley, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'',&lt;ref name=guns&gt;{{cite news|last=Turley |first=Jonathan |title=A liberal's lament: The NRA might be right after all |url=https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20071004/opcom_thurs.art.htm |accessdate=September 6, 2012 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=October 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AUNd905W?url=http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20071004/opcom_thurs.art.htm |archivedate=September 7, 2012 |page=A 11 |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',&lt;ref name=pops/&gt; and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB90570708755275500 Perjury Isn't a Political Decision], by Jonathan Turley, The Wall Street Journal, September 14, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently appears in the national media as a commentator on a multitude of subjects&lt;ref name=media&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/turley073098.htm Jonathan Turley Takes His Case to TV], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', July 30, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35490005?q=Jonathan%20Turley Jonathan Turley at MSNBC] Jonathan Turley at [[MSNBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]] controversy to the [[Terri Schiavo]] case in 2005.&lt;ref name=schiavo&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-03-22-schiavo-law_x.htm Temptation tops the Constitution], ''[[USA Today]]'', March 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  He is often a guest on Sunday talk shows,&lt;ref name=media/&gt; with over two-dozen appearances on ''[[Meet the Press]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|ABC This Week]]'', ''[[Face the Nation]]'', and ''[[Fox News Sunday]]''. He served as a contributor on ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' from 2003 until 2011, and later on [[Current TV]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/business/media/20pundit.html?_r=1 At New Network, Olbermann Sets Sights on MSNBC], ''[[The New York Times]]'',  June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011 and early 2012; Turley also appears occasionally on [[Pacifica Radio]]'s ''[[Democracy Now!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2006/6/27/is_bush_administrations_bank_spy_program Is Bush Administration’s Bank Spy Program One Part of a Resurgent Total Information Awareness?], [[Democracy Now!]], June 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, he has been the legal analyst for [[NBC News]] and [[CBS News]] covering stories that ranged from the Clinton impeachment to the presidential elections.&lt;ref name=turley/&gt;  He is on the board of contributors of ''USA Today''.&lt;ref name=usaboard&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/USA-TODAY-board-of-contributors.htm ''USA Today's'' Board of Contributors], ''[[USA Today]]'', March 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Turley is widely regarded as a champion of the [[rule of law]] and his stated positions in many cases and his self-proclaimed "socially liberal agenda"&lt;ref name=guns/&gt; have led liberal and progressive thinkers to consider him a champion for their causes, especially on issues such as [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]], [[environmental law]],&lt;ref name=media/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Turley, ''A Guide to Citizen Law Enforcement: Fighting Environmental Crime at Facilities of the U.S. Department of Energy and Defense'', published by Santa Barbara Project for Participatory Democracy, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; [[civil and political rights|civil rights]],&lt;ref name=wapost/&gt;&lt;ref name=padilla/&gt; and the illegality of [[torture]].&lt;ref name=dogs&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/nyregion/03detain.html?pagewanted=print 9/11 Detainees in New Jersey Say They Were Abused With Dogs], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=water/&gt;&lt;ref name=yawn/&gt; ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'' has referred to Turley as a "liberal law professor and longtime [[civil libertarianism|civil libertarian]]."&lt;ref name=hudson&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46338_Page2.html Health-law judge's prosecutor past], by Josh Gerstein, ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'', December 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Turley has nevertheless exhibited his disagreement with rigid [[ideological]] stances in contradiction to the established law with other stated and published opinions.&lt;ref name=media/&gt;&lt;ref name=hudson/&gt;
 
In numerous appearances on ''Countdown with Keith Olbermann'' and ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'', he has called for criminal prosecution of Bush administration officials for [[war crime]]s, including torture.&lt;ref name=maddow&gt;[http://wn.com/rachel_maddow_show_jonathan_turley_on_war_crimes%20Rachel%20Maddow%20Show,%20Jonathan%20Turley%20On%20War%20Crimes Rachel Maddow Show: Jonathan Turley on War Crimes], Video, January 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[USA Today]]'' in October 2004, he famously argued for the [[legal status of polygamy|legalization of polygamy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/2004-10-03-turley_x.htm "Polygamy laws expose our own hypocrisy"]. ''USA Today''. Published: October 3, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; provoking responses from writers such as [[Stanley Kurtz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/266jhfgd.asp?nopager=1 "Polygamy vs. Democracy"]. ''The Weekly Standard''. Published: June 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertmohler.com/2004/10/05/the-floodgates-open-usa-today-promotes-polygamy/ "The Floodgates Open: USA Today Promotes Polygamy"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]], which, he contends, does away with ''[[habeas corpus]]'', Turley says, "It's something that no one thought—certainly I didn't think—was possible in the United States. And I am not too sure how we got to this point. But people clearly don't realize what a fundamental change it is about who we are as a country. What happened today changed us."&lt;ref name=yawn/&gt;

He is a critic of special treatment for the church in law, asking why there are laws that "expressly exempt faith-based actions that result in harm."&lt;ref name=church&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/11/13/DI2009111303161.html When a child dies, faith is no defense. Why do courts give believers a pass?], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Turley disagrees with the theory that dealing with [[Bullying|bullies]] is just a part of growing up, claiming that they are "no more a natural part of learning than is parental abuse a natural part of growing up" and believes that "[[litigation]] could succeed in forcing schools to take bullying more seriously".&lt;ref name=bully&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=5378214&amp;page=1 Bullying's Day in Court]", ''[[USA Today]]'', July 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written extensively about the injustice of the [[death penalty]], noting, "Human error remains a principal cause of botched executions. ... eventually society will be forced to deal directly with a fundamental moral question: Has death itself become the intolerable element of the death penalty?"&lt;ref name=death&gt;[http://www.fadp.org/news/20080117(4)/ The Punishment Fits the Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052851/http://www.fadp.org/news/20080117%284%29/ |date=September 28, 2011 }}", ''[[USA Today]]'', January 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He worries that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] is injecting itself into partisan politics.&lt;ref name=scalia&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/05/nation/la-na-scalia-20110105 Scalia to Talk About Constitution to House Members], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He has frequently expressed the view that recent nominees to the court hold extreme views.&lt;ref name=exviews&gt;"[https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-01-09-troubling-times_x.htm Troubling Times, a Troubling Nominee]", ''USA Today'', January 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;"[https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-07-05-turley-edit_x.htm The Roberts Court: Seeing Is Believing]", ''USA Today'', July 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Turley has a strong [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] streak and sometimes infuriates the left with a contrarian position.&lt;ref name=media/&gt; For instance, he has said, "It is hard to read the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] and not honestly conclude that the Framers intended gun ownership to be an individual right."&lt;ref name=guns/&gt; Moreover, Turley testified in favor of the Clinton impeachment.&lt;ref name=peach&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/impeach111598.htm House Takes Up Impeachment Task With Time Short]", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 15, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In another commentary that outraged progressives, Turley defended Judge [[Henry E. Hudson]]'s ruling declaring the [[health insurance mandate|individual mandate]] unconstitutional for violating the [[Commerce Clause|Commerce Clause of the Constitution]],: "It's very thoughtful — not a screed. I don't see any evidence this is motivated by Judge Hudson's personal beliefs. ... Anybody who's dismissing this opinion as a political screed has obviously not read the opinion."&lt;ref name=hudson/&gt;

Turley described U.S. Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] in an op-ed as President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[sin-eater]], writing:

{{quote|For Obama, there has been no better sin eater than Holder. When the president promised CIA employees early in his first term that they would not be investigated for torture, it was the attorney general who shielded officials from prosecution. When the Obama administration decided it would expand secret and warrantless surveillance, it was Holder who justified it. When the president wanted the authority to kill any American he deemed a threat without charge or trial, it was Holder who went public to announce the "kill list" policy.  Last week, the Justice Department confirmed that it was Holder who personally approved the equally abusive search of Fox News correspondent James Rosen's e-mail and phone records in another story involving leaked classified information. In the 2010 application for a secret warrant, the Obama administration named Rosen as "an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator" to the leaking of classified materials. The Justice Department even investigated Rosen's parents' telephone number, and Holder was there to justify every attack on the news media.&lt;ref name=Mike&gt;Turley, Jonathan. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/05/28/fire-eric-holder-column/2367713/ "Fire Eric Holder"],''[[USA Today]]'', May 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a December 2013 congressional hearing, responding to a question from Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) about the danger posed by President Barack Obama's apparent unilateral modification of laws passed by Congress, Turley said:

{{quote|The danger is quite severe. The problem with what the president is doing is that he's not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system. He's becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid. That is the concentration of power in every single branch. This Newtonian orbit that the three branches exist in is a delicate one but it is designed to prevent this type of concentration. There {{sic|is}} two trends going on which should be of equal concern to all members of Congress. One is that we have had the radical expansion of presidential powers under both President Bush and President Obama. We have what many once called an imperial presidency model of largely unchecked authority. And with that trend we also have the continued rise of this fourth branch. We have agencies that are quite large that issue regulations. The Supreme Court said recently that agencies could actually define their own or interpret their own jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=Bill&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/12/04/turley_obamas_become_the_very_danger_the_constitution_was_designed_to_avoid.html Turley: Obama's "Become The Very Danger The Constitution Was Designed To Avoid"], ''[[Real Clear Politics]]'', December 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As of Friday, November 21, 2014, Turley has agreed to represent House Speaker [[John Boehner]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in a suit filed against the Obama administration alleging unconstitutional implementation of the Affordable Care Act, specifically the [[health insurance mandate|individual mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/21/politics/house-gop-sue-the-president-over-obamacare/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 Boehner: House GOP files Obamacare suit]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2016, Libertarian Party candidate for President, Gary Johnson, announced that if elected Turley would be one of his two top choices for the Supreme Court seat that remained open following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/johnson-top-scotus-picks/|title=Gary Johnson Announces His Top 2 SCOTUS Picks|date=October 12, 2016|newspaper=The Libertarian Republic|language=en-US|access-date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 column for ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', Turley was critical of [[military intervention]] in the Middle East and questioned its constitutionality. He also mentioned that he supported the Supreme Court nomination of [[Neil Gorsuch]].&lt;ref&gt;http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/defense/326359-is-americas-military-effort-in-the-middle-east-constitutional&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testimony before Congress===
The conceptual thread running through many of the issues taken on by Turley is that they involve claims of [[executive privilege]].  For example, he said, "the president's claim of executive authority based on Article II would put our system on a slippery slope."&lt;ref name=privil&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/jan/17/20060117-101314-5569r/ Legal scholars split on wiretaps], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', January 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued against national security exceptions to fundamental [[constitutional right]]s.&lt;ref name=exviews/&gt;&lt;ref name=congress&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2007-01-17-turley-edit_x.htm Can Congress stop the war?], ''[[USA Today]]'', January 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a frequent witness before the House and Senate on constitutional and statutory issues.&lt;ref name=porteo/&gt;&lt;ref name=future&gt;[http://www.fff.org/conference2008/speakers/index.htm Restoring the Republic 2008: Foreign Policy &amp; Civil Liberties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020142944/http://www.fff.org/conference2008/speakers/index.htm |date=October 20, 2011 }}, The Future of Freedom Foundation, June 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as well as tort reform legislation.&lt;ref name=turley/&gt;

Turley has testified in Congress against President Bush's [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless domestic surveillance program]] and was lead counsel in a case challenging it.  In regard to warrantless wiretaps he noted that, "[[Anna Diggs Taylor|Judge Anna Diggs Taylor]] chastised the government for a flagrant abuse of the Constitution and, in a direct message to the president, observed that ''there are no hereditary kings in America.''"&lt;ref name=snoop&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-08-20/news/0608200377_1_surveillance-program-national-security-agency-surveillance-controversial-monitoring-program NSA ruling much like a pig in parlor], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', August 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When Congressional Democrats asked the justice department to investigate the CIA's [[2005 CIA interrogation tapes destruction|destruction of terrorist interrogation tapes]] Turley said, "these are very serious allegations, that raise as many as six identifiable crimes ranging from contempt of Congress, to contempt of Justice, to perjury, to false statements."&lt;ref name=tapes&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-12-08-voa36.html CIA, US Justice Dept. to Investigate Destruction of Interrogation Tapes], ''[[Voice of America News]]'', December 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, in an interview by [[Keith Olbermann]] of [[MSNBC]], he expressed strong disapproval of the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]].&lt;ref name=yawn&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15318240/ National yawn as our rights evaporate], New law redefines habeas corpus law professor explains, ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'', October 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When the U. S. Senate was about to vote on [[Michael Mukasey]] for U.S. attorney general, Turley said, "The attorney general nominee's evasive remarks on '[[water-boarding]]' should disqualify him from the job."&lt;ref name=water&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-turley24oct24,0,1182359.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions Mukasey's confirmation: a vote about torture], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On the treatment of terrorism suspect [[José Padilla (prisoner)|José Padilla]], Turley says, "The treatment of Padilla ranks as one of the most serious abuses after 9/11 ... This is a case that would have shocked the Framers. This is precisely what many of the drafters of the Constitution had in mind when they tried to create a system of checks and balances." Turley considers the case of great import on the grounds that "Padilla's treatment by the military could happen to others."&lt;ref name=padilla&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0904/p02s01-usju.html In Padilla interrogation, no checks or balances], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', September 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9146">A '''lawyer referral service''' maintains a network of lawyers, and connects people in need of lawyers with its participating attorneys. A potential client who contacts a lawyer referral service is directed to a lawyer who practices in the area of law that is most appropriate for their situation. Some lawyer referral services charge a fee for providing a referral, while others provide referrals at no cost to the prospective client. Many referral services connect prospective clients with lawyers who have agreed to provide a low-cost or free initial consultation.&lt;ref name="LRfaq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawyer Referral Services|url=http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Public/Free-Legal-Information/Legal-Guides/Lawyer-Referral-Service|website=State Bar of California|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Referral services are often provided by state and local [[bar associations]] as a public service.
* Referral services may also be offered by non-profit organizations and advocacy groups.
* For-profit referral services&lt;ref name="LRfaq"/&gt; may connect lawyers with clients who pay a membership fee, or a fee for successfully referred clients, subject to rules against sharing fees with non-lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Wendy|title=Must I Really Turn Down That Referral Fee?|journal=GPSolo|date=July 2011|volume=28|issue=5|url=https://www.americanbar.org/publications/gp_solo/2011/july_august/referral_fee_ethics.html|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Historically, lawyer referral services involved prospective clients contacting a bar association or responding to an advertisement, by placing a telephone call to the service and seeking a referral. &lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association, "Consumers' Guide to Legal Help Hiring a Lawyer" (April 2008) http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/findlegalhelp/faq_hiringlawyer.cfm#lawyerreferral&lt;/ref&gt; With the internet boom in the 1990s, many consumers turned to the web to search for goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Hornsby, Will and Staud, Ron, "Technological Innovations and Their Ethical Implications" American Bar Association http://www.abanet.org/cle/clenow/nosearch/public/probonotechethics/part1.html#&lt;/ref&gt; A research study released in 2012, shows that 76 percent of adult consumers looking for a lawyer used online resources at some point during the search process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Study Says 3 of 4 Consumers Look for Lawyers Online |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-study-says-3-4-consumers-look-lawyers-online|publisher=Stephen Fairley |work=The National Law Review|date=2012-05-22|accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some referral services provide referrals to lawyers in a broad range of areas of legal practice. Others may focus on referrals within a narrow range of practice areas, or a single practice area.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Legal Resources for the Elderly Program|url=https://www.nmbar.org/nmstatebar/Directory/I_Need_a_Lawyer/Legal_Resources_for_the_Elderly/Nmstatebar/For_Public/LREP/LREP.aspx|website=State Bar of New Mexioc|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online lawyer referral services are sometimes called ''attorney-client matching'' services. People who contact a service may be matched with one or more attorneys, based upon such factors as area of legal practice and geographic location. Lawyers who participate in these services may pay a fee for participation, a fee for each referral, or in some cases a percentage of the amount charged to a referred client.&lt;ref name=larson&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How To Find a Lawyer For Your Case|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer/howtohire.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=1 February 2018|date=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the prospective client will be able to choose from a list of referred attorneys, while in other cases the referral will be made to a specific participating lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Popper|first1=Ted|title=Online Lawyers: Starting to Click|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2003-09-29/online-lawyers-starting-to-click|accessdate=1 February 2018|publisher=Bloomberg|date=30 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a client is unable to afford a lawyer and the legal problem is not a matter that can be handled by a lawyer on a percentage fee basis, some referral services may attempt to match the client with a pro bono lawyer, or direct the client to contact a [[legal aid]] organization or law student clinic for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABA: Free Legal Help|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_services/flh-home/flh-free-legal-help.html|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
Ethical issues may arise for lawyers who participate in for-profit referral services, and state rules governing participation can vary significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Model Supreme Court Rules Governing Lawyer Referral and Information Services|url=http://apps.americanbar.org/legalservices/lris/meetsabastds.html|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethics Opinion 369. Sharing of Legal Fees With a Lawyer Referral Service|url=https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-369.cfm|website=DCBar|publisher=District of Columbia Bar|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISBA Ethics Opinions on Referral Fees and Arrangements|url=https://www.isba.org/ethics/bysubject/Referral%20Fees%20and%20Arrangements|website=Illinois State Bar Association|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some referral services are certified by bar associations,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Lawyer Referral Service Provider Certification|url=http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Access-to-Justice/About-the-Center/LRS-Provider-Certification|website=State Bar of California|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[American Bar Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standing Committee on Lawyer Referral and Information Service|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_referral.html|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certified referral services must maintain standards of service as defined by the certifying organization. Among those standards, certification may require that participating lawyers meet minimum standards of experience, or maintain legal malpractice insurance.

The American Bar Association provides a list attorney referral services that meet its certification requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawyer Referral Directory|url=https://www.americanbar.org/directories/lawyer-referral-directory.html|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Some legal associations have expressed concern that lawyer referral services can lead to lawyers trying to undercut each other to get clients, rather than focusing on quality of service and the development of their reputation among their peers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utterant.co.uk/current-affairs/bid4fees-making-solicitors-bid-for-legal-work/ utterant.co.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920184554/http://www.utterant.co.uk/current-affairs/bid4fees-making-solicitors-bid-for-legal-work/ |date=September 20, 2010 }} Retrieved 29 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern about lawyer referral services relates to client confidentiality. When a prospective client contacts a lawyer directly about retaining the lawyer's services, the communication is normally held absolutely confidential under principles of attorney-client privilege. Where a lawyer referral service collects information from a person who is seeking a lawyer, that information will not normally be confidential, raising the possibility that information provided to the referral service will be discoverable by the opposing party in any subsequent litigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/legalservices/findlegalhelp/usa_findlawyer.cfm abnet.org] Retrieved 29 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyer referral services may have minimal requirements for participation, and in some cases may not do any verification of a lawyer's qualification or credentials. As a consequence, it remains necessary for a person who uses a referral service to investigate a lawyer's qualification before retaining the lawyer.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

Some controversy also arises from whether professional referral services are anti-competitive in nature.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} For instance, since Board Certified attorneys often charge a higher hourly rate than other competent general practitioners, if a Lawyer Referral Service requires Board Certification for certain types of referrals, instead of merely providing the public a choice between a Board Certified attorney and a competent attorney who is not Board Certified, the effect may be to restrict competition and restrict public choice and push up consumer prices.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}  State bars, which license attorneys, may be complicit in restricting client choice.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Aspects}}
[[libertarianism|Libertarians]] have differing opinions on the validity of [[intellectual property]].

==Political parties==
The [[Libertarian Party of Canada]] takes "a moderate approach to patents and copyrights", calling for "a careful review of existing and proposed legislation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.libertarian.ca/platform-libertarian-party-canada |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111131447/https://www.libertarian.ca/platform-libertarian-party-canada |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anarcho-capitalist views ==

Since [[anarcho-capitalist]]s oppose the existence of even a minimal state, this ideological framework requires that any functions served by intellectual property law promulgation and enforcement be provided through private sector institutions.

[[Murray Rothbard]] argues for allowing contractually arising infinite copyright terms and against the need for any government role in protecting intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp |title=Chapter 3 – Triangular Intervention |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that government's involvement in defining arbitrary limits on the duration, scope, etc. of intellectual property in order to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts" is inherently problematic, since "By what standard do you judge that research expenditures are 'too much,' 'too little,' or just about enough?" He argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap10e.asp#7._Patents_Copyrights |title=Chapter 10 – Monopoly and Competition (continued) |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morris and Linda Tannehill]] propose that ideas in the form of inventions could be registered in a privately owned "data bank"; the inventor could then buy insurance against the theft and unauthorized commercial use of the invention, and the insurance company would guarantee to not only compensate the inventor for any losses suffered due to such infringement but to stop such unauthorized use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|pages=58–59|author=Tannehill, Morris and Linda|isbn=0-930073-08-8|chapter=Property – The Great Problem Solver|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents to intellectual property rights include [[Wendy McElroy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |year=2011 |title=Contra Copyright, Again |url=http://libertarianpapers.org/wp-content/uploads/article/2011/lp-3-12.pdf |journal=Libertarian Papers |volume=3 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom G. Palmer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=Tom G. |year=1990 |title=Are Patents and Copyrights Morally Justified? The Philosophy of Property Rights and Ideal Objects |url=http://tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/papers/palmer-morallyjustified-harvard-v13n3.pdf |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy |volume=13 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Lepage (economist)|Henri Lepage]], [[Boudewijn Bouckaert]], [[Jeffrey Tucker]], and [[N. Stephan Kinsella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bouillon |first=Hardy|editor-link1=Jörg Guido Hülsmann |editor1-first=Jörg Guido |editor1-last=Hülsmann |editor2-first=Stephan |editor2-last=Kinsella |title=Property, Freedom, and Society: Essays in Honor of Hans-Hermann Hoppe |publisher=Ludvig von Mises Institute |year=2009 |page=157 |chapter=A Note on Intellectual Property and Externalities |isbn=978-1-933550-52-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsella points out in ''Against Intellectual Property'' that patents may be inefficient since they divert resources from research and development to patent filing and lawsuits. He notices that theoretical research can not be patented as easily as practical research and thus theoretical research is relatively underfunded. Moreover, he argues that property rights can only apply to resources that are scarce, which intellectual property is not. Kinsella also claims that the only way that intellectual property rights can be implemented is by limiting others' physical property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kinsella |first=N. Stephan |year=2008 |title=Against Intellectual Property |url=http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Stephan%20Kinsella/Against%20Intellectual%20Property.pdf |publisher=Ludvig von Mises Institute |isbn=978-1-933550-32-9 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David D. Friedman]] takes a neutral stance on intellectual property, claiming "there are good arguments on both sides of that question".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybell.com/exclusive-interviews/3771/Anthony-Wile-David-D-Friedman-on/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Left-libertarian views ==

[[Roderick T. Long]] argues that the concept of intellectual property is not libertarian. He holds that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]], and that since information exists in people's minds and other people's property, one cannot own information without owning other people. Claiming that authors and publishers will continue to produce absent copyright protection, he cites the fact that hundreds of thousands of articles are uploaded onto the Internet by their authors every day, available to anyone in the world for free and that nearly all works written before the 20th century are in the public domain, yet pre-1900 works are still published and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libertariannation.org/a/f31l1.html |title=The Libertarian Case Against Intellectual Property Rights |publisher=Libertariannation.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020914233356/http%3A//libertariannation.org/a/f31l1.html |archivedate=2002-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Tucker]], opposing intellectual property, writes, "...the patent monopoly...consists in protecting inventors...against competition for a period long enough to extort from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labor measure of their services,{{spaced ndash}}in other words, in giving certain people a right of property for a term of years in laws and facts of Nature, and the power to exact tribute from others for the use of this natural wealth, which should be open to all."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Tucker, ''Instead of a Book, By a Man Too Busy to Write One: A Fragmentary Exposition of Philosophical Anarchism'' (New York: Tucker, 1893), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ayn Rand's views ==

[[Ayn Rand]], founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], supported copyrights and patents, noting in ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |authorlink=Ayn Rand |year=1966 |title=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Patents and copyrights are the legal implementation of the base of all property rights: a man's right to the product of his mind. Every type of productive work involves a combination of mental and of physical effort: of thought and of physical action to translate that thought into a material form. The proportion of these two elements varies in different types of work. At the lowest end of the scale, the mental effort required to perform unskilled manual labor is minimal. At the other end, what the patent and copyright laws acknowledge is the paramount role of mental effort in the production of material values; these laws protect the mind's contribution in its purest form the origination of an ''idea''. The subject of patents and copyrights is ''intellectual'' property. ... Thus the law establishes the property right of a mind to that which it has brought in existence.}}
She held that patent should be granted for limited terms only: 
{{cquote|If it were held in perpetuity, it would lead to the opposite of the very principle on which it is based: it would lead, not to the earned reward of achievement, but to the unearned support of parasitism.  It would become a cumulative lien on the production of unborn generations, which would ultimately paralyze them. Consider what would happen if, in producing an automobile, we had to pay royalties to the descendants of all the inventors involved, starting with the inventor of the wheel and on up.  Apart from the impossibility of keeping such records, consider the accidental status of such descendants and the unreality of their unearned claims.}}

== Other libertarian and anarcho-libertarian views ==

Anarchists such as [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[J. Neil Schulman]] have also argued for forms of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;See: Kinsella, [http://c4sif.org/2015/10/classical-liberals-and-anarchists-on-intellectual-property/ Classical Liberals and Anarchists on Intellectual Property], which also lists other classical liberals and anarchists and their positions on intellectual property. Kinsella's post [http://c4sif.org/2015/04/pro-ip-anarchists-and-anti-ip-patent-attorneys/ Pro-IP “Anarchists” and anti-IP Patent Attorneys] lists some more recent anarchist libertarians in favor of intellectual property. For further discussion of the views of various libertarians on this matter, see his [http://c4sif.org/resources/ Anti-IP Resources], [http://c4sif.org/2011/04/the-four-historical-phases-of-ip-abolitionism/ The Four Historical Phases of IP Abolitionism], and [http://c4sif.org/2011/04/the-origins-of-libertarian-ip-abolitionism/ The Origins of Libertarian IP Abolitionism].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{PoliticsScotland}}
{{Scots law}}
'''Her Majesty's Advocate''', known as the '''Lord Advocate''' ({{lang-gd|Morair Tagraidh}}, {{lang-sco|Laird Advocat}}), is the chief legal officer of the [[Scottish Government]] and [[the Crown]] in Scotland for both civil and criminal matters that fall within the [[devolution|devolved]] powers of the [[Scottish Parliament]]. He or she is the chief [[public prosecutor]] for Scotland and all [[prosecution]]s on indictment are conducted by the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]], nominally in the Lord Advocate's name.

The officeholder is one of the [[Great Officers of State]] of Scotland. The current Lord Advocate is The Rt Hon. [[James Wolffe]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].

==History==
The office of Advocate to the monarch is an ancient one. The first recognised Lord Advocate was esteemed legal scholar and philosopher Sir Ross Grimley of Goldenacre, recorded in 1483 as serving [[King of Scots|King]] [[James III of Scotland|James III]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=85P_KlmwvisC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The constitutional role of the Attorney General: fifth report of session 2006–07], [[UK Parliament]] Constitutional Affairs Committee, Ev 96&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1707 to 1998, the Lord Advocate was the chief legal adviser of the British Government and the Crown for Scottish legal matters, both civil and criminal, until the [[Scotland Act 1998]] devolved most domestic affairs to the Scottish Parliament. [[Her Majesty's Government]] is now advised on [[Scots law]] by the [[Advocate General for Scotland]].

The Lord Advocate is not head of the [[Faculty of Advocates]]; that position is held by the [[List of Deans of the Faculty of Advocates|Dean of the Faculty of Advocates]].

==Parliamentary and government role==

Until devolution in 1999, all Lord Advocates were, by convention, members of the United Kingdom government, although the post was not normally in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. Since devolution, the Lord Advocate has been an automatically ''ex officio'' member of the Scottish Government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scotland Act 1998]], s 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1999 until 2007, the Lord Advocate attended the weekly Scottish Cabinet meetings. However, after the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 election]], the new First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] decided that Lord Advocate would no longer attend the Scottish Cabinet, stating he wished to "de-politicise" the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=798472007 |title=Lord Advocate excluded from new Cabinet |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=23 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818135056/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=798472007 |archivedate=18 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until devolution, all Lord Advocates were, by convention, members of either the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] or the [[House of Lords]] to allow them to speak for the Government. Those who were not already members of either house received a [[life peerage]] on appointment. Post-devolution, the Lord Advocate and the [[Solicitor General for Scotland]] are permitted to attend and speak in the Scottish Parliament ''ex officio'', even if they are not Members of the Scottish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Scotland Act 1998, s 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future careers of Lord Advocates==

Appointments as [[Senator of the College of Justice|Senators]] of the [[College of Justice]] were formerly made on the nomination of the Lord Advocate. Every Lord Advocate between 1842 and 1967 was later appointed to the bench, either on demitting office or at a later date. Many Lord Advocates in fact nominated themselves for appointment as [[Lord President of the Court of Session]] or as [[Lord Justice Clerk]].

==Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service==
The [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]] is headed by the Lord Advocate and the [[Solicitor General for Scotland]], and is the [[public prosecution service]] in Scotland. It also carries out functions which are broadly equivalent to the [[coroner]] in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Incorporated within the Crown Office is the Legal Secretariat to the Lord Advocate.

===Crown Agent===
The Crown Agent is the principal legal advisor to the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters. He or she also acts as Chief Executive for the Department and as solicitor in all legal proceedings in which the Lord Advocate appears as representing his or her own department. They issue general instructions for the guidance of Crown counsel, procurators fiscal, sheriff clerks and other public officials; transmits instructions from Crown counsel to procurators fiscal about prosecutions; and in consultation with the Clerk of Justiciary, arranges sittings of the [[High Court of Justiciary]]. At trials in the High Court in Edinburgh, they attend as instructing solicitor. They are assisted by other senior legal, managerial and administrative staff.

The Crown Agent also holds the office of [[Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer]].

==Calls for reform==

In the Greshornish House Accord of 16 September 2008, Professors [[Hans Köchler]] and [[Robert Black (professor)|Robert Black]] said—{{cn|date=July 2018}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is inappropriate that the Chief Legal Adviser to the Government is also head of all criminal prosecutions. Whilst the Lord Advocate and Solicitor General continue as public prosecutors the principle of separation of powers seems compromised. The potential for a conflict of interest always exists. Resolution of these circumstances would entail an amendment of the provisions contained within the Scotland Act 1998.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The judges of Scotland's highest court came to share this view. In a submission to the commission set up to consider how the devolution settlement between Scotland and the United Kingdom could be improved, the judges recommended that the Lord Advocate should cease to be the head of the public prosecution system and should act only as the Scottish Government's chief legal adviser. They noted various ways in which the Lord Advocate's roles had caused problems for the judicial system, including the ability "to challenge... virtually any act of a prosecutor has led to a plethora of disputed issues, with consequential delays to the holding of trials and to the hearing and completion of appeals against conviction." The judges proposed three alternative solutions: stripping the Lord Advocate of responsibility for prosecutions, exempting the Lord Advocate from compliance with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], or changing the law on criminal appeals. While not specifically favouring any of the three, they noted that the third proposal was radical enough to "generate considerable controversy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commissiononscottishdevolution.org.uk/engage/submissions-received.php Judiciary in the Court of Session] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121223234812/http://www.commissiononscottishdevolution.org.uk/engage/submissions-received.php |date=23 December 2012 }} (Just over half way down the list headed "Miscellaneous Submissions").&lt;/ref&gt;

{{UStaxation}}
'''Lucky duckies''' is a term that was used in ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' editorials starting on 20 November 2002 to refer to [[United States|Americans]] who pay no [[United States federal income tax|federal income tax]] because they are at an income level that is below the tax line (after [[tax deduction|deductions]] and [[tax credits|credits]]). The term has outlived its original use to become a part of the informal terminology used in the tax reform and income inequality debates in the United States.

The term's meaning has split depending on political persuasion. For many [[conservative]]s, the term has become part of a political theory that the USA is developing an increasingly large '[[wikt:moocher|moocher]]' class who depend on government benefits paid for by taxes from richer or harder-working citizens, pay no taxes themselves and vote themselves higher benefits paid for from the taxes of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prager|first1=Dennis|title=The Progressive Income Tax: Which Side Is 'Greedy'?|url=http://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2014/11/08/the-progressive-income-tax-which-side-is-greedy/|website=PJ Media|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led prominent conservative politicians such as [[Rick Perry]] and [[Michele Bachmann]] to propose that poorer citizens should have their taxes increased to make them more aware of the problems of excessive taxation and so-called [[big government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foley|first1=Elise|title=Michele Bachmann Income Tax Plan: Everyone Should Pay Two Happy Meals' Worth|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/09/michele-bachmann-happy-meal-tax_n_1085223.html|website=Huffington Post|publisher=AOL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burman|first1=Len|title=Rick Perry: Middle Income Americans Don't Pay Enough Income Taxes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2011/08/18/rick-perry-middle-income-americans-dont-pay-enough-income-taxes/|website=Forbes|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2012 Republican presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]] [[47%|commented]] that "There are 47 percent of the people who will vote [[liberalism|liberal]] no matter what...believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That's an entitlement. The government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what...47% of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect...I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." Perry, announcing his presidential campaign, commented "Spreading the wealth punishes success...we're dismayed at the injustice that nearly half of all Americans don't even pay any income tax."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perry|first1=Rick|title=Presidential Candidacy Announcement|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/rickperrypresidentialcandidacyannouncement.htm|publisher=American Rhetoric|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was, meanwhile immediately criticised by [[liberalism|liberal]]s and some conservatives for suggesting that people are 'lucky' to be so poor that they are not eligible to pay tax. It has also been used to suggest that the WSJ and, by proxy, conservatives lack real awareness of poverty or intend to raise taxes on poor people for the benefit of richer taxpayers, a suggestion that has been described as 'reverse [[class conflict|class warfare]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galupo|first1=Scott|title=Demolishing the GOP's Tax "Freeloader" Myth|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/scott-galupo/2011/11/22/demolishing-the-gops-freeloader-myth|website=US News and World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galupo|first1=Scott|title=Rick Perry's Reverse Class Warfare|url=http://spectator.org/blog/28064/why-conservatives-shouldnt-tax-poor|website=US News &amp; World Report|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that as many [[red states]] are particularly poor, many individuals who pay no income tax are in fact generally conservative voters, while many rich residents of [[blue states]] consistently vote liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldman|first1=Samuel|title=Where Do the 47 Percent Live?|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/where-do-the-47-percent-live/|publisher=The American Conservative|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=David|title=Where Are the 47% of Americans Who Pay No Income Taxes?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/where-are-the-47-of-americans-who-pay-no-income-taxes/262499/|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henderson|first1=Alex|title=10 red states that mooch off the federal government|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/09/20/10_red_states_that_mooch_off_the_federal_government_partner/|website=Salon|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original argument ==

The ''Journal'' defined the term in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Who are these lucky duckies? They are the beneficiaries of tax policies that have expanded the personal exemption and [[standard deduction]] and targeted certain voter groups by introducing a welter of tax credits for things like child care and education. When these escape hatches are figured against income, the result is either a zero liability or a liability that represents a tiny percentage of income.&lt;ref name="TNTCTLD"&gt;"The Non-Taxpaying Class:
Those lucky duckies!" ''The Wall Street Journal'' 20 November 2002 [http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110002937]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The worry of the ''Journal'''s editorialist was that "as fewer and fewer people are responsible for paying more and more of all taxes, the constituency for tax cutting, much less for [[United States Tax Reform|tax reform]], is eroding. Workers who pay little or no taxes can hardly be expected to care about tax relief for everybody else. They are also that much more detached from recognizing the costs of government."&lt;ref name="TNTCTLD" /&gt;

For example, according to the editorial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Say a person earns $12,000. After subtracting the personal exemption, the standard deduction and assuming no tax credits, then applying the 10% rate of the lowest bracket, the person ends up paying a little less than 4% of income in taxes. It ain't peanuts, but not enough to get his or her blood boiling with tax rage.&lt;ref name="TNTCTLD" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Journal'' published three articles using the phrase "lucky duckies": "The Non-Taxpaying Class", the original article, on 20 November 2002;&lt;ref name="TNTCTLD" /&gt; "Lucky Duckies Again" (20 January 2003);&lt;ref name="LDA"&gt;"Lucky Duckies Again: Look at who won't pay taxes under Bush's plan" ''The Wall Street Journal'' 20 January 2003 [http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110002938]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Even Luckier Duckies" (3 June 2003).&lt;ref name="ELD"&gt;"Even Luckier Duckies: When a tax cut becomes a welfare check" ''The Wall Street Journal'' 3 June 2003 [http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110003577]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion and limits of the original argument ==
In recent years, the number and percentage of Americans who pay no federal income tax has increased.  According to a 2007 report by the Statistics of Income division of the [[Internal Revenue Service]],&lt;ref&gt;"SOI Tax Stats — Individual Income Tax Returns Publication 1304" Internal Revenue Service [https://www.irs.gov/taxstats/indtaxstats/article/0,,id=134951,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006 the Internal Revenue Service received 134,372,678 individual income tax returns, of which 90,593,081 (67.42%) showed that they paid or owed federal income tax for 2005.  That is, 32.58% of those Americans who filed income tax returns did not owe any federal income tax at all for 2005.  This percentage increased substantially in 2008, and for 2009 was [[47%]].

The federal income tax is only one of several taxes Americans pay.  Americans who pay zero federal income taxes do pay other taxes, such as [[payroll taxes]] (a.k.a. [[FICA tax|FICA]]), [[excise tax]]es, [[sales tax]]es, [[tariffs]], [[gift taxes]], [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|unemployment taxes]], [[state income tax]]es, [[property tax]]es, and [[Self employment tax#US Taxation|self-employment tax]]es.

Federal payroll taxes are imposed on nearly every American with income from employment (there are exceptions for certain students, certain religious objectors, and certain state/local government employees who participate in a state/local pension).  Federal self-employment taxes are imposed on nearly every American with net income from self-employment above $400 (again with exceptions for certain religious objectors).  So almost all Americans with some [[earned income]] do pay some federal taxes.  However, the US also allows [[earned income tax credit]]s to certain individuals, which can lower their income taxes below zero.  When these refundable tax credits equal or exceed other federal taxes, the individual is said to pay "no net federal taxes."

As of 2006, according to New York Times columnist [[David Leonhardt]], approximately 10% of Americans paid no net federal taxes.&lt;ref&gt;https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/who-doesnt-pay-taxes/&lt;/ref&gt;  Leonhardt did not have figures for 2010, and there were several refundable tax credits which were created or expanded between 2006 and 2010.

According to [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimates,&lt;ref&gt;"Historical Effective Federal Tax Rates: 1979 to 2005" Congressional Budget Office [http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/88xx/doc8885/12-11-HistoricalTaxRates.pdf#page=6]&lt;/ref&gt; the lowest earning 20% of Americans (24.1 million households earning an average of $15,900 in 2005) paid an "effective" federal tax rate of 3.9%, when taking into account income tax, social insurance tax, and excise tax.  For comparison, the same study found that the highest earning 1% of Americans (1.1 million households earning an average of $1,558,500 in 2005) paid an "effective" federal tax rate of 21.9%, when including the same three types of taxes.

In 2011, British financial journalist Ian Cowie argued that people who do not earn enough to pay tax should be stripped of the right to vote as they should not have the right to control how others' money is taxed and spent: "Their contribution is not just negative in financial terms – they take out more than they put in – but likely to be damaging to the decisions taken by democracies." His colleague [[Benedict Brogan]] described the idea as 'intriguing' and 'worth checking out'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cowie|first1=Ian|title=A tax-based alternative to the Alternative Vote|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ianmcowie/100010127/a-tax-based-alternative-to-the-alternative-vote/|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, U.S. Representative [[Jim DeMint]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[South Carolina|S.C.]]) told ''[[The New Yorker]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think we've got a major crisis in democracy…  We assume that voters will restrain the growth of government because it becomes burdensome to them personally. But today fewer and fewer people pay taxes, and more and more are dependent on government, so the politician who promises the most from government is likely to win. Every day, the Republican Party is losing constituents, because every day more people can vote themselves more benefits without paying for it. The tax code will destroy democracy, by putting us in a position where most voters don't pay for government.&lt;ref&gt;Lemann, Nicholas "Bush's Trillions: How to buy the Republican majority of tomorrow" ''New Yorker'' 19 February 2001 [https://web.archive.org/web/20030824121054/http://www.business.uiuc.edu/seppala/econ102/newyork.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==

===From liberals===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:LuckyDuckyComic.png|right|frame|The opening panel to one of Ruben Bolling’s comic strips that features Lucky Ducky&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocomics.com/tomthedancingbug/2012/10/11 Lucky Ducky, in "All's Fair in Class and War" (2003).] - Originally released on [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] at June 12th, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
The ''Journal'' was frequently mocked for its use of the term "lucky duckies" to refer to people whose lack of a federal income tax burden is the direct result of their lower income.  This attitude was satirized as [[Let them eat cake#Coronation and queenship|"let them eat cake"]]-style myopia.

[[Ruben Bolling]]'s ''[[Tom the Dancing Bug]]'' comic in ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' magazine, for instance, periodically features a poor duck who keeps "outwitting" a fat, top-hatted oligarch by cleverly submitting to the misfortunes of his economic class.

Jonathan Chait, in ''The New Republic'', reacted to the ''Journal'' editorial by writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the things that has fascinated me about ''The Wall Street Journal'' editorial page is its occasional capacity to rise above the routine moral callousness of hack conservative [[punditry]] and attain a level of exquisite depravity normally reserved for villains in [[James Bond]] movies.&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in Manjoo, Farhad "March of the 'lucky duckies'" ''Salon'' 21 December 2002 [http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/12/21/duckies/]&lt;!-- broken link: http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20021223&amp;s=diarist122302 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And one "lucky ducky" wrote to the ''Journal'' editor, offering to share his luck (in a form of [[logical argument]] sometimes known as a [[A Modest Proposal|modest proposal]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;I will spend a year as a ''Wall Street Journal'' editor, while one lucky editor will spend a year in my underpaid shoes. I will receive an editor's salary, and suffer the outrage of paying federal income tax on that salary. The fortunate editor, on the other hand, will enjoy a relatively small federal income tax burden, as well as these other perks of near poverty: the gustatory delights of a diet rich in black beans, pinto beans, navy beans, chickpeas and, for a little variety, lentils; the thrill of scrambling to pay the rent or make the mortgage; the salutary effects of having no paid sick days; the slow satisfaction of saving up for months for a trip to the dentist; and the civic pride of knowing that, even as a lucky ducky, you still pay a third or more of your gross income in income taxes, payroll taxes, sales taxes and property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, Pier "'Lucky Duckie' Invites Editors into his Pond" as quoted in "&amp;c.: A Daily Journal of Politics" ''The New Republic Online'' 12 June 2003 [https://web.archive.org/web/20030626024327/http://www.tnr.com/etc.mhtml?pid=475]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===From conservatives===
Conservatives have also criticised the argument. Writing in 2011, [[Ramesh Ponnuru]] commented that "conservatives should seek to remedy the problem by cutting benefits rather than by raising taxes in the hope it will make people more eager to cut benefits. To seek to raise taxes on poor and middle-class people would be a terrible mistake. The idea is bound to be unpopular. And it would alter the character of conservatism for the worse [into a] creed openly focused on helping one group at the expense of another, a kind of mirror image of egalitarian liberalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ponnuru|first1=Ramesh|title=The Freeloader Myth|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/283265/freeloader-myth-ramesh-ponnuru|publisher=National Review|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer W. James Antle said of the thresholds enabling poorer individuals to pay no income tax: "Conservatives supported all of these policies...[and the poor] are not exactly 'lucky duckies'...it seems to me that a conservative vision of personal responsibility would entail having people living on subsistence-level incomes support themselves and their families before they support the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Antle|first1=James|title=Why Conservatives Shouldn't Tax The Poor|url=http://spectator.org/blog/28064/why-conservatives-shouldnt-tax-poor|publisher=American Spectator|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Masters in Law''' ('''M.L.''' or '''LL.M.'''; [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|Magister Legum}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Legum Magister}}'') is a postgraduate academic degree, pursued by those either holding an undergraduate academic law degree, a professional law degree, or an undergraduate degree in a related subject. In some jurisdictions the "Masters in Law" is the basic professional degree for admission into legal practice.

==Background on legal education in [[common law]] countries==
To become a [[lawyer]] and practice law in most states and countries, a person must first obtain a law degree. While in most common law countries a [[Bachelor of Laws]] (or LL.B.) is required, the U.S. and Canada generally require a professional doctorate, or [[Juris Doctor]], to practice law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://work.chron.com/jd-attorney-10582.html|title=Do You Have to Have a J.D. to Be an Attorney?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.utoronto.ca/admissions/youth-outreach/so-you-want-become-lawyer|title=So, You Want to Become a Lawyer - University of Toronto Faculty of Law|website=www.law.utoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) is a [[professional doctorate]]&lt;ref name="aaude2008"&gt;{{cite web |last=Association of American Universities Data Exchange |url=http://aaude.org/documents/public/reference/glossary-graded.doc |title=Glossary of Terms for Graduate Education |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=National Science Foundation |year=2006 |url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf06312/nsf06312.pdf |series=NSF |title=Time to Degree of U.S. Research Doctorate Recipients |journal=InfoBrief, Science Resource Statistics |volume=06-312 |page=7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308130032/http://spellmirelaw.com/ |archivedate=8 March 2016 |df= }} Under "Data notes" this article mentions that the J.D. is a professional doctorate.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sdcba1969"&gt;{{cite web |last=San Diego County Bar Association |year=1969 |url=http://www.sdcba.org/ethics/ethicsopinion69-5.html |title=Ethics Opinion 1969-5 |accessdate=2008-05-26}}.

The degree is earned by completing [[law school]] in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and other common law countries.  Many who hold the degree of Juris Doctor are [[professionals]] committed to the [[practice of law]], and may choose to focus their practice on [[criminal law]], [[tort]], [[family law]], [[corporate law]], or a wide range of other areas.

The majority of individuals holding a J.D. must pass an examination in order to be licensed to practice law within their respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncble.org/|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barexam.virginia.gov/|title=VBBE - Welcome|first=|last=itembridge.com|website=barexam.virginia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Requirements.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914204116/http://admissions.calbar.ca.gov/Requirements.aspx |archivedate=14 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybarexam.org/|title=BOLE- OFFICIAL PAGE NEW YORK STATE BAR EXAMINATION|website=www.nybarexam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person wishes to gain specialized knowledge through research in a particular area of law, he or she can continue his or her studies after an LL.B. or J.D. in an LL.M. program. The word ''legum'' is the genitive plural form of the Latin word ''lex'' and means "of the laws". When used in the plural, it signifies a specific body of laws, as opposed to the general collective concept embodied in the word ''jus'', from which the words "juris" and "justice" derive.  LL.M. is sometimes incorrectly written L.L.M., but as with all Latin plural abbreviations, one doubles the first letter in to indicate that the abbreviation is a plural.

The highest research degree in law is the [[S.J.D.]] (or J.S.D., depending on the institution), and it is equivalent to the Doctor of Philosophy in Law (PhD or DPhil depending on the law school in UK) or [[Doctorate#France|Doctorat en droit]] (in France), but not a full equivalent to the [[Doctorate#Germany|Doktor der Rechtswissenschaften (Dr. iur.)]] in Germany (since Germany has two doctoral theses, the second being the [[Habilitation#Germany|Habilitation]]). There are also variant doctoral degrees, such as the D.C.L. (Doctor of Civil Law) degree bestowed by [[McGill University]] in Canada.  Most schools require an LL.M. before admission to a SJD or a PhD in law degree program.  Like the PhD, the SJD degree generally requires a dissertation that is graded (often by two graders), orally defended (by an exam known as ''[[oral exam|viva voce]]'') and then often published as a book or series of articles.

The "Doctor of Laws" (LL.D.) degree in the United States of America is usually an [[honorary degree]].

==International situation==

Historically, the LL.M. degree is an element particular to the education system of English speaking countries, which is based on a distinction between [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|Master's]] degrees. Over the past years, however, specialized LL.M. programs have been introduced in many European countries, even where the [[Bologna process]] has not yet been fully implemented.

Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Cyprus, Italy and Switzerland require a Master's with an additional two to five years to become a lawyer.

As of 2014, Spain requires a master's degree in addition to a 4 years' degree to become a lawyer.

In Finland, an LL.M. is the standard graduate degree required to practice law.&lt;ref&gt;Government Decree on University Degrees (794/2004) section 31. Candidate of Laws was the pre-Bologna name for the graduate degree. [http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2004/en20040794.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; No other qualifications are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1734/en17340004.pdf|title=Code of Judicial Procedure (4/1734) chapter 15 section 2|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be allowed to practice law in the Netherlands, one needs an LL.M. degree with a specific (set of) course(s) in litigation law. The Dutch Order of Lawyers (NOVA) require these courses for every potential candidate lawyer who wants to be conditionally written in the district court for three years. After receiving all the diplomas prescribed by NOVA and under supervision of a "patroon" (master), a lawyer is eligible to have his own practice and is unconditionally written in a court for life but he/she will need to continually update his/her knowledge.

==Types of LL.M. degrees==

There are a wide range of LL.M. programs available worldwide, allowing students to focus on almost any area of the law. Most universities offer only a small number of LL.M. programs. One of the most popular LL.M. degrees in the United States is [[tax law]], sometimes referred to as an MLT (Master of Laws in Taxation).

Other LL.M. degree programs include [[bankruptcy law]], [[banking law]], [[commercial law]], [[criminal law]], [[dispute resolution]], [[entertainment and media law]], [[environmental law]], estate planning (usually as a sub-specialty of tax law), [[financial services law]], [[human rights law]], [[information technology law]], insurance law, [[intellectual property law]], [[international law]], [[law and economics]], [[litigation]], [[maritime law]], military law, patent law, prosecutorial sciences, real estate law, [[social care]] law, telecommunications law, [[trade law]], [[Trial Advocacy]]. Some law schools allow LL.M. students to freely design their own program of study from the school's many upper-level courses and seminars, including commercial and corporate, international, constitutional, and human rights law.

In Europe, LL.M. programs in [[European law]] are recently very popular, often referred to as LL.M. Eur ([[Master of European Law]]). In the Netherlands and its former colonies, the title used was [[:nl:Meester in de Rechten|Meester in de Rechten]] (Mr.)

Some LL.M. programs, particularly in the United States, and also in China, focus on teaching foreign lawyers the basic legal principles of the host country (a "comparative law" degree).

Moreover, some programs are conducted in more than one language, give the students the opportunity to undertake classes in differing languages.

==Requirements==

LL.M. programs are usually only open to those students who have first obtained a [[law school|degree in law]]. There are exceptions to this but an undergraduate degree or extensive experience in a related field is still required. Full-time LL.M. programs usually last one year and vary in their graduation requirements. Most programs require students to write a [[thesis]]. Some programs are research oriented with little classroom time (similar to a [[M.Phil.]]), while others require students to take a set number of classes (similar to a taught degree or [[M.Sc.]]).

LL.M. degrees are often earned by students wishing to develop more concentrated expertise in a particular area of law. Pursuing an LL.M. degree may also allow law students to build a professional network. Some associations provide LL.M. degree holders with structures designed to strengthen their connections among peers and to access a competitive business environment, much like an [[MBA degree]].

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the LL.M. is generally only open to law graduates. However, some universities permit a non-law graduate to undertake variants of the degree.

The shortage of graduate program/articles places has resulted in some LL.B. graduates proceeding directly to an LL.M. course prior to seeking graduate employment.

Unique variants of the LL.M. exist, such as the Master of Legal Practice (M.L.P.) available at the [[Australian National University]], where students who have completed the Graduate Diploma of Legal Practice (which law graduates must obtain before being able to be admitted as a solicitor/barrister), will be granted some credit towards the Master qualification. Other variants of the LL.M. are more similar to the LL.M. available in the wider Commonwealth but under a different title, for example Master of Commercial Law, Master of International Law or Master of Human Rights Law. These courses are usually more specialised than a standard LL.M.

===Canada===

In Canada, the LL.M. is generally only open to law graduates holding an LL.B., B.C.L., or a J.D. as a first degree.  Students can choose to take research based LL.M. degrees or course based LL.M. degrees.  Research based LL.M. degrees are one- or two-year programs that require students to write a thesis that makes a significant contribution to their field of research.  Course based LL.M. degrees do not require a significant research paper.  An LL.M. can be studied part-time, and at some schools, through distance learning.  LL.M. degrees can be general, or students can choose to pursue a specialized area of research.

Canadian law graduates pursue LL.M. degrees because they would like to pursue a career in academia or because they would like to deepen their knowledge in a specific area of the law. Canadian law graduates in most of the provinces in Canada must complete an internship with a law firm (known as "articling") and a professional legal training course, as well as pass professional exams in order to be called to the bar in a province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Articling |url=http://www.lsuc.on.ca/articling/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign trained lawyers who wish to practice in Canada will first need to have their education and experience assessed by the Federation of Law Societies of Canada's National Committee on Accreditation. Upon having received a certificate of accreditation from the National Committee on Accreditation, foreign law graduates would then have to obtain articles with a law firm, take the professional legal training course, and pass the professional exams to be called to the bar in a province.

The University of British Columbia's LLM in Common Law is an example of one of a few LLM courses that help to prepare students for the professional exams.

===China (Mainland)===

The LL.M. is available at China University of Political Science and Law, and the entrance requirements are: a native English speaker, or near native English, with any bachelor's degree. The course is flexible and allows students to study Mandarin and assists with organizing work experience in Beijing and other cities in China. It normally takes two years, but can be completed in one and a half years if students take the required credits in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawschoolchina.com |title=CUPL - China University of Political Science and Law |publisher=Lawschoolchina.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flagship of the [[China-EU School of Law]] (CESL) in Beijing is a Double Master Programme including a Master of Chinese Law and a Master of European and International Law (with special focus on Chinese Law). The Master of European and International Law is taught in English, open for international students and can be studied as a single master programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesl.edu.cn |title=China-EU School of Law, CUPL |publisher=Cesl.edu.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beijing Foreign Studies University]] has launched an online LLM for international professionals. The course is taken over two years, with the first covering online lessons through video and assignments, the second year is for the dissertation and an online defense is required at the end. Students are required to attend Beijing for an introductory week in September to enroll and meet students and staff. Students also have the opportunity to take work experience at a top five law firm in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfsulaw.com|title=Online Chinese Law Programs|website=Beijing Foreign Studies University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llm-guide.com/article/694/beijing-foreign-studies-university-announces-online-llm-programs |title=Beijing Foreign Studies University Announces Online LL.M. Programs |publisher=Llm Guide |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===

In [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sorbonne-assas-ils.org/&lt;/ref&gt; the LL.M. is in English language.
The LL.M. in International Business Law is available at [[Panthéon-Assas University]] ([[Paris]]), the oldest school of law in France.

The entrance requirements are:

* Very good English level, with Master's degree in Law (or equivalent); or
* Alternative diploma and four years' professional experience.

The course is flexible and allows students to study [[French language|French]].

===Germany===

In [[Germany]], the LL.M. is seen as an advanced legal qualification of supplementary character. As such, Master of Laws programmes are generally open not only to law graduates, but also to graduates of related subjects or those displaying a genuine interest in and link to the particular LL.M. programme in question. Some graduates choose to undertake their LL.M. directly following their "Erstes Juristisches [[Staatsexamen]]" (the "first state examination" constitutes the first stage of the official German legal training and completes the German undergraduate law degree), an alternative undergraduate course, or their "Zweites Juristisches Staatsexamen" (that is, the second and final stage of the official German legal training, following which graduates are referred to as "Volljuristen" who then have access to practice in different branches of the legal profession). On the other hand, many professionals now take career breaks in order to study for an LL.M., in particular for subjects of growing importance or those with constantly changing dynamics, such as European law, economic law or media law for example.

=== Hong Kong ===
LL.M. degree programmes are offered by the law faculties of [[The University of Hong Kong]], the [[Open University of Hong Kong]], [[The Chinese University of Hong Kong]] and the [[City University of Hong Kong]]. An LL.B. degree is usually required for admission, but for some specialised programmes, such as the LL.M. in Human Rights programme offered by HKU, requires an undergraduate degree in laws or any related discipline.

===India===
In [[India]], the thrust of [[legal education]] is on the [[Bachelor of Laws#India|undergraduate law degrees]] with most of those opting for the [[Bachelor of Laws#India|undergraduate law degree]] either going forward to enroll themselves with the [[Bar Council of India]] and start practicing as [[Bachelor of Laws#India|Advocates]] or giving legal advice without being eligible to appear in courts (a consequence of non-enrollment). Similar to the United Kingdom, a master's degree in Law in India is basically opted to specialize in particular areas of law. Traditionally the most popular areas of specialization in these master's degrees in law in India have been [[constitutional law]], [[family law]] and [[taxation law]].

However, with the establishment of the specialized [[autonomous law schools in India]] in 1987 (the first was the [[National Law School of India University]]) much emphasis is being given at the master's level of legal education in India. With the establishment of these universities, focus in specialization has been shifted to newer areas such as [[corporate law]], [[intellectual property law]], [[international trade law]] etc. Master's degree of Law in India was in earlier times of 2 years but at present it is of only 1 year.

===Ireland===
A number of universities and colleges in Ireland offer LL.M. Master of Laws programmes, such as [[Dublin City University]], [[Trinity College Dublin]], [[University College Cork]] who have an LL.M. e-Law programme, National University of Ireland, Galway ([[NUIG]]) who offer an LL.M in Public Law, National University of Ireland, Maynooth ([[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|NUIM]]), who offer an LLM programme and an LLM in International Business Law (this is a dual degree with the [[Catholic University of Lyon]]) and [[Griffith College]] in Dublin and Cork who offer LL.M. programmes in International, Commercial and Human Rights Law. [[Hibernia College]] offer a completely online LL.M. in International Business Law validated by [[Birmingham City University]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hibernia moves to meet the demand for teachers'' by Margaret O'Brien, Sunday Business Post, 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
[[Italy]] offers both master programs in Italian and in English, depending on the school. They are often called "laurea specialistica", that is, the second step of the Bologna plan (European curriculum), and in this case they last two years. For example, the [http://www.llmsd.unimi.it/ University of Milan] offers a 2 years LLM on Sustainable Development.  In Alto Adige programs are also taught in German, as in [https://www.unibz.it/it/economics/progs/master/economics_publicsector/default.html/ Bolzano].

In Italy the term "master" often refers to a vocational master, 6 or 12 months long, on specific areas, such as "law and internet security", or "law of administrative management", is often taught part-time to allow professionals already working in the field to improve their skills.

===Mauritius===

The LLM in International Business Law from [[Panthéon-Assas University]] is also available in Mauritius&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sorbonne-assas-ils.org/&lt;/ref&gt; in Medine Village campus.

===Norway===
The Norwegian legal degrees cand.jur. and master i rettsvitenskap are officially translated to English as Master of Laws (LL.M.), as these degrees are more comprehensive than the basic graduate law degree in common law countries (e.g. JD and LL.B). The last year in the five year professional Norwegian law degree program is thus considered to correspond to a LL.M specialization.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, [[University of the Punjab]], [[University of Karachi]], [[Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto University of Law]], [[International Islamic University, Islamabad]], [[Government College University (Faisalabad)|Government College University, Faisalabad]], [[University of Sargodha]] are LL.M. degree awarding institutions.
Completing a LL.M. qualification in Pakistan consists of studying eight subjects in four semesters; this spans over a period of two years and also requires the student to write a thesis on a proposed topic. A student has to pass in each of the subject in order to qualify for LL.M. degree, and the passing mark is set at 60%. The programme is taught in [[English language|English]].

Universities in Pakistan teach comparative constitutional law, comparative human rights law and comparative jurisprudence as mandatory subjects. The programmes also include research methodology and four elective subjects, which may include company law, taxation law, intellectual property law and banking law.

===Portugal===
The Master of Laws programmes offered in Portugal are extremely varied but haven't, for the most part, adopted the designation LL.M., being more commonly called ''Mestrado em Direito'' (Master's Degree in Law), like the ones at [http://www.uc.pt/en/fduc/courses Coimbra University's Faculty of Law] and [http://por.ulusiada.pt/cursos/2ciclo/2ciclo.php?v=en&amp;cp=M11 Lusíada University of Porto]. Albeit the classical ''Mestrado em Direito'' takes two years to finish and involves a scientific dissertation, there are some shorter variants. A few ''Mestrados'' with an international theme have specifically adopted the LL.M designation: the LL.M in European and Transglobal Business Law at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131113054659/http://www.direito.uminho.pt/Default.aspx?tabid=8&amp;pageid=132&amp;lang=pt-PT School of Law of the University of Minho] and the LL.M. Law in a European and Global Context and the Advanced LL.M. in International Business Law, both at the [http://www.catolicalaw.fd.lisboa.ucp.pt/en/programmes Católica Global School of Law], in Lisbon.

===Singapore===
In [[Singapore]], the LLM is in English language.
The LLM in International Business Law from [[Panthéon-Assas University]] is also available in Singapore in Insead campus.

===South Africa===
{{see also|Legal education in South Africa}}
[[File:University of Pretoria Faculty of Law.jpg|thumb|[[University of Pretoria Faculty of Law]]]]
In [[South Africa]], the LL.M. is a [[postgraduate degree]] offered both as a course-based, and as a research-based [[Masters degree|Master's]].  In the former case, the degree comprises advanced coursework in a specific area of law as well as (limited) related research, usually in the form of a "short dissertation", while in the latter, the degree is entirely [[thesis]] ("dissertation") based. The first type, typically, comprises practice-oriented "training", while the second type is theory-oriented, often preparing students for admission to [[LL.D.]] or [[Ph.D.]] programmes; see [[Doctor of law#South Africa]]. The research Master's essentially reflects an ability to conduct independent research, whereas a Doctoral thesis is, in addition, an original contribution in the field of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/contents/faculties/law/docs/LLM_LLD_A5brochure_2010_v2.pdf|title=This website was recently revamped|website=www.unisa.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission is generally limited to [[Bachelor of Laws#South Africa|LL.B.]] graduates, although holders of other law degrees, such as the BProc, may be able to apply if [[Attorneys in South Africa|admitted as attorneys]] and / or by completing supplementary LL.B. coursework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/contents/myRegistration/docs/English+Brochures/LLM+and+LLD+2011.pdf|title=This website was recently revamped|website=www.unisa.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], an LL.M. programme is open to those holding a recognised legal qualification, generally an undergraduate degree in Laws or a [[Common Professional Examination|CPE]]. They do not have to be or intend to be legal practitioners. An LL.M. is not required, nor is it a sufficient qualification in itself to practise as a [[solicitor]] or [[barrister]], since this requires completion of the [[Legal Practice Course]], [[Bar Professional Training Course]], or, if in Scotland, the [[Diploma in Legal Practice]] but is an opportunity to gain specialist knowledge of a particular area of law or an understanding of the legal systems of other nations. As with other degrees, an LL.M. can be studied on a part-time basis at many institutions and in some circumstances by [[distance learning]]. Some providers of the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] and the [[Legal Practice Course]] also allow the student to gain an LL.M. qualification on top of these professional courses by writing a [[dissertation]].

Most institutions allow those without a first degree in law onto their LL.M. programme although there are still minimum educational requirements, such as an undergraduate degree, or evidence of substantial professional experience in a related field. Examples of such programmes include the Master of Studies in Legal Research at Oxford, the LL.M. degrees at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and LL.M.s at the University of Leicester&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.le.ac.uk/law/pg/index.html University of Leicester].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Queen's University Belfast]] offers an LL.M. suite, accessible to legal and social science graduates, leading to specialisms in sustainable development, corporate governance, devolution or human rights. [[Northumbria University]] offers an innovative approach to an LL.M. qualification to students starting the master's programme as undergraduates. Students completing this four-year programme graduate with a combined LL.M. and [[Legal Practice Course]] professional qualification or BPTC.

An LL.M course can therefore sometimes be a choice comparable to an [[MBA]] or an [[accountancy]] degree, acting as a supplementary discipline intended for career enhancement. So, for example, an engineer working extensively with matters such as [[intellectual property]] ([[patent]]s, etc.) may seek broader knowledge and recognition by pursuing an LL.M.

====Oxbridge====

The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge have taken slightly different approaches to other British universities to postgraduate legal study, as they have in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;See generally: [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Cambridge]] has a taught postgraduate law course, which formerly conferred an LL.B. on successful candidates (undergraduates studying law at Cambridge received a B.A.).  In 1982 the LL.B. for postgraduate students was replaced with a more conventional LL.M. to avoid confusion with undergraduate degrees in other universities.&lt;ref name=Cantab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcl.law.cam.ac.uk/the-faculty-of-law|title=Posgraduate Law|publisher=University of Cambridge, Faculty of Law|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally in 2012 the University of Cambridge introduced the M.C.L. (Masters of Corporate Law) aimed at postgraduate students with interests in corporate law.&lt;ref name=Cantab /&gt;

The [[University of Oxford]] unconventionally names its taught masters of laws B.C.L. ([[Bachelor of Civil Law]]) and M.Jur. ([[Magister Juris]]), and its research masters either MPhil (Master of Philosophy) or MSt (Master of Studies).&lt;ref name=Oxon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/postgraduate_study.php|title=Postgraduate Study|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oxford continues to name its principal postgraduate law degree the B.C.L. for largely historic reasons, as the B.C.L. is one of the oldest (and therefore within the Oxford hierarchy, most senior) degrees, having been conferred since the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Oxon2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Gb19Mhd1oeEJ:https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/published/postgraduate/BCL-MJurClassProfileBook2013.pdf+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk|title=BCL/MJUR Profile, Class of 2013/2014|publisher=University of Oxford, Faculty of Law|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The M.Jur. was introduced in 1991.&lt;ref name=Oxon2 /&gt;  At present there is no LL.M. degree conferred by the University.&lt;ref name=Oxon /&gt;  Oxford claims that the B.C.L. is "the most highly regarded taught masters-level qualification in the common law world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/postgraduate/ebrochure/oxford_bcl_15-16.html |title= |publisher=University of Oxford, Faculty of Law |accessdate=13 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822211703/http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/postgraduate/ebrochure/oxford_bcl_15-16.html |archivedate=22 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally in 2010 the University of Oxford introduced the MSc in Law and Finance (MLF). The degree is taught jointly by the Faculty of Law and the Saïd Business School. The MLF programme involves a combination of finance and economic courses combined with BCL law courses.

===United States===
In the United States the acquisition of an LL.M. degree is often a way to specialize in an area of law such as tax law, business law, international business law, health law, trial advocacy, environmental law or intellectual property. A number of schools have combined J.D.-LL.M. programs, while others offer the degree through online study. Some LL.M. programs feature a general study of American law.

====Programs for foreign legal graduates====
An LL.M. degree from an ABA-approved law school also allows a foreign lawyer to become eligible to apply for [[admission to the bar]] (license to practice) in certain [[U.S. state|states]]. Each state has different rules relating to the admittance of foreign-educated lawyers to [[state bar association]]s.

An LL.M. degree from an ABA-approved law school qualifies a foreign legal graduate to take the bar exam in [[Alabama]], [[California]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Texas]], as well as in the independent republic of [[Palau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2014/06/13/texas-bar-changes-admission-guidelines-to-allow-foreign-lawyers/|title=Foreign Lawyers Can Now Practice in Texas - JDJournal|first=|last=Scott|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, legal practice in the home jurisdiction plus a certain amount of coursework at an accredited law school qualifies a foreign legal graduate to take the bar exam in [[Legal education in Alaska|Alaska]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Missouri]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Tennessee]], [[Utah]] and [[West Virginia]]. However, a number of states, including [[Arizona]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[New Jersey]] and [[North Carolina]] only recognize JD degrees from accredited law schools as qualification to take the bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbex.org/fileadmin/mediafiles/downloads/Comp_Guide/CompGuide_2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-31 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331044630/http://www.ncbex.org/fileadmin/mediafiles/downloads/Comp_Guide/CompGuide_2010.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York (state)|New York]] allows foreign lawyers from [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries to sit for the New York bar exam once they have completed a minimum of 24 credit hours (usually but not necessarily in an LL.M. program) at an ABA-approved law school involving at least two basic subjects tested on the New York bar exam.  However, beginning for those who take the bar exam in July 2013, applicants will be required to complete 24 credits of law school coursework, including 12 credits in specific areas of law.&lt;ref&gt;22 NYCRR §520.6(b)(3)(vi)http://www.nybarexam.org/Rules/Rules.htm#520.6&lt;/ref&gt;    Lawyers from [[Common law|common-law]] countries face more lenient restrictions and may not need to study at an ABA-approved law school.  Foreign lawyers from both civil law and common law jurisdictions, however, are required to demonstrate that they have successfully completed a course of law studies of at least three years that would fulfill the educational requirements to bar admission in their home country.&lt;ref name="New York Court of Appeals Rules of Practice § 520.6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ctapps/520rules.htm#6 |title=New York Court of Appeals Rules of Practice § 520.6 |accessdate=1 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411141414/http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ctapps/520rules.htm#6 |archivedate=11 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International law and other LL.M. programs====
As of 2008, there is one LL.M. degree in International Law offered by [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]], the oldest school of international affairs in the United States. Given that the degree specializes in international law, and is not teaching a first degree in U.S. law (the J.D. degree), the program has not sought ABA accreditation.

The [[Notre Dame Law School]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]] offers an LL.M in International Human Rights Law to JD graduates from ABA-accredited US schools or LL.B or equivalent from accredited non-US schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanrights.nd.edu/academic-programs/llm/ |title=Notre Dame LL.M. in International Human Rights Law Program |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Duke University School of Law]] and [[Cornell Law School]] offer J.D. students the opportunity to simultaneously pursue an LL.M. in International and Comparative Law.

The [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Law]] provides an LL.M. in Space, Cyber &amp; Telecommunications Law, the only program providing focused study in these three areas.  The program was established using a grant from [[NASA]] and a partnership with the U.S. Air Force Strategic Command.

St. Mary’s University offers the LL.M. in International and Comparative Law, with students having the option to complete both it and their J.D. simultaneously.

The [[University of Tulsa College of Law]] offers an LL.M. in American Indian and Indigenous Peoples Law to JD graduates from ABA-accredited US schools or LL.B or equivalent from accredited non-US schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utulsa.edu/law/llm|title=Master of Laws (LLM)|publisher=University of Tulsa|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one institution that offers an ABA-approved LL.M, that does not offer the first degree in law (the J.D. degree): The U.S. Army [[Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School]] offers an officer's resident graduate course, a specialized program beyond the first degree in law, leading to an LL.M. in Military law, with concentrations in Administrative and Civil Law, Government Contract and Fiscal Law, Criminal Law, and Operational and International Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/legaled/approvedlawschools/approved.html |title=ABA-Approved Law Schools &amp;#124; Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar |publisher=Abanet.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/8525736A005BC8F9/0/CE89C60813E53611852573550051C3D8?opendocument&amp;noly=1 |title=Graduate Course (LL.M. Program) |publisher=Jagcnet.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Law (UK) ceased offering its online LL.M in International Legal Practice to new students who enrolled after July 2015. It currently offers two online LL.M programmes in Legal Practice (Conflict Resolution) and Legal Practice (Intellectual Property).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.ac.uk/postgraduate/llm/|title=LLM Online Masters Degree in Law|website=www.law.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8544">A '''memorandum of understanding''' ('''MoU''') is a type of agreement between two ([[bilateralism|bilateral]]) or more ([[multilateralism|multilateral]]) parties. It expresses a convergence of will between the parties, indicating an intended common line of action. It is often used either in cases where parties do not imply a legal commitment or in situations where the parties cannot create a legally enforceable agreement. It is a more formal alternative to a [[gentlemen's agreement]].

Whether a document constitutes a binding contract depends only on the presence or absence of well-defined legal elements in the text proper of the document (the so-called "[[Four corners (law)|four corners]]"). The required elements are: [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]], and the [[intention to be legally bound]] (''animus contrahendi''). In the U.S., the specifics can differ slightly depending on whether the contract is for goods (falls under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] [UCC]) or services (falls under the common law of the state).

==Inside a company or government agency==
Many companies and government agencies use MoUs to define a relationship between departments, agencies or closely held companies.
In the [[United Kingdom]], the term MOU is commonly used to refer to an agreement between parts of [[The Crown]]. The term is often used in the context of [[devolution#United Kingdom|devolution]], for example the 1999 concordat between the central [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] and the Scottish [[Environment Directorate]]. 

MoUs can also be used between a government agency and a non-commercial, non-governmental organization. Examples from international development contexts include: 

* MoUs developed by grassroots organizations working with municipalities in South Africa to improve land and housing for the urban poor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradlow|first=Benjamin Hofman|date=2013|others=Department of Urban Studies and Planning, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.|title=Quiet conflict : social movements, institutional change, and upgrading informal settlements in South Africa|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/80905|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The MoU used by NGOs and the Bangladeshi government to determine tasks under the National Tuberculosis Control Programme&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Batley|first=Richard|last2=Mcloughlin|first2=Claire|date=2010-02-01|title=Engagement with Non-State Service Providers in Fragile States: Reconciling State-Building and Service Delivery|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-7679.2010.00478.x|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=131–154|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2010.00478.x|issn=0950-6764}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The MoU used by city authorities and NGOs in [[Harare]], Zimbabwe to collaboratively document and upgrade [[Slum|slums]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shand|first=Wayne|date=2018-08-06|title=Making spaces for co-production: collaborative action for settlement upgrading in Harare, Zimbabwe|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956247818783962|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|pages=095624781878396|doi=10.1177/0956247818783962|issn=0956-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In public international law==
In international relations, MoUs fall under the broad category of [[treaty|treaties]] and should be registered in the [[United Nations]] treaty collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/ |title=United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher=treaties.un.org |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice and in spite of the [[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs]]' insistence that registration be done to avoid 'secret diplomacy', MoUs are sometimes kept confidential. As a matter of law, the title of MoU does not necessarily mean the document is binding or not binding under international law. To determine whether a particular MoU is meant to be a legally binding document (i.e., a treaty), one needs to examine the parties’ intent as well as the signatories' position (e.g., Minister of Foreign Affairs vs. Minister of Environment). A careful analysis of the wording will also clarify the exact nature of the document. The [[International Court of Justice]] has provided some insight into the determination of the legal status of a document in the landmark case of ''Qatar v. Bahrain'', 1 July 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=1&amp;PHPSESSID=66a15edfa6bb89698b26627e76c1d56b&amp;case=87&amp;code=qb&amp;p3=4/ |publisher=International Court of Justice |title=Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain (Qatar v. Bahrain)|date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
One advantage of MoUs over more formal instruments is that, because obligations under international law may be avoided, they can often be put into effect without requiring legislative approval. Hence, MoUs are often used to modify and adapt existing treaties, in which case these MoUs have factual treaty status. The decision concerning ratification, however, is determined by the parties' internal law and depends to a large degree on the subject agreed upon. MoUs that are kept confidential (i.e., not registered with the UN) cannot be enforced before any UN organ, and it may be concluded that no obligations under international law have been created. As was obvious{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} in ''Qatar v. Bahrain'', disputes may arise concerning the status of the document once one of the parties seeks to enforce its provisions.

Although MoUs in the [[multilateralism|multilateral]] field are seldom seen, the transnational [[aviation]] agreements are actually MoUs.

===Examples===
Examples include:
* The ''Memorandum of Understanding Relating to the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems on May 26, 1972'' signed by US President [[Richard Nixon]] and the [[Soviet Union]] updating the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ABM Treaty: Memorandum of Understanding |work=Treaty Compliance |publisher=[[Office of the Secretary of Defense |Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics]] |url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/tc/treaties/abm/72sccreg.htm |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Memorandum of Understanding on Hijacking of Aircraft and Vessels and Other Offenses'' between the US and [[Cuba]], meant to criminalize hijacking in both countries (February 3, 1973)
* The agreement between the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Cuba]], under which Cayman immigration officers must give Cuban refugees two choices: disembark and be repatriated back to Cuba, or continue on their way with no help{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
* The [[Agreed Framework]] between the U.S. and North Korea over nuclear weaponry on October 21, 1994
* The [[Oil for Food program]], for which [[Iraq]] signed an MoU in 1996
* The agreement between the government of [[Indonesia]] and the [[Free Aceh Movement|GAM]] in the [[Aceh]] peace process, 15 August 2005.
* The agreement between the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Jordan (country)|Jordan]], [[Libya]] and [[Lebanon]] regarding potential extradition of suspects (commonly [[terrorist]] suspects), who, if they are to be tried, must be tried fairly and in a manner similar to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]; for example, withholding from using evidence obtained through the use of [[torture]] (Article 3). Such an understanding has been criticised for its inability to be legally enforced. This has been highlighted in the current deportation process of the suspected terrorist [[Abu Qatada]], who is wanted by Jordan in connection with a terrorist attack. However, at present, the Court of Appeal has rejected the UK Government's appeal based on the Court's concern of Jordan obtaining evidence potentially incriminating Qatada through the use of torture.
* The ''Memorandums of Understanding on Labour Cooperation'' between the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Singapore]] and [[New Zealand]] on 2008, in parallel with their respective free trade agreements
*The [[Under2 MOU]] is a 2015 memorandum of understanding which sets [[climate change mitigation]] goals for jurisdictions with over 1 billion residents.

The purpose of the program, which began in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = National Core Indicators: Ten Years of Collaborative Performance Measurement. Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|url = http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/0047-6765%25282007%252945%255B354%253ANCITYO%255D2.0.CO%253B2?journalCode=mere|doi = 10.1352/0047-6765(2007)45[354:ncityo]2.0.co;2 | volume=45|journal=Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|pages=354–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to support NASDDDS member agencies (state [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]] agencies) to gather a standard set of [[Performance measurement|performance]] and outcome measures that can be used to track their own performance over time, to compare results across states, and to establish national [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]].

The primary aim of NCI is to collect and maintain valid and reliable data about the performance of public developmental disabilities [[Service system|service systems]]. NCI states and project partners use NCI data not only to improve practice at the state level but also to add knowledge to the field, to influence state and national policy, and to inform strategic planning initiatives for NASDDDS.

Through participation in the program, NCI states make a commitment to share information with [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]] so that data can be used for policy change and [[Quality management|quality improvement]]. To that end, the National Core Indicators website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome {{!}} National Core Indicators|url = http://www.nationalcoreindicators.org|website = www.nationalcoreindicators.org|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides public access to NCI data and current information about how the results are being used at the state and national levels to support policy, [[research]], and [[advocacy]] efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJi89H2oyAY|title = YouTube Video: Why is the NCI important?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Allen|first = Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The National Core Indicators framework ==
The NCI framework comprises an '''Adult Consumer Survey''', three family [[Survey methodology|surveys]] ('''The''' '''Adult Family Survey''', '''The''' '''Family/Guardian Survey''' and '''The''' '''Children/Family Survey''') and '''The''' '''Staff Stability Survey'''.

=== The Adult Consumer Survey ===
'''The Adult Consumer Survey''' is completed with a minimum of 400 individuals (per participating state) who are 18 years of age or older and receiving at least one paid service in addition to [[Case management (US health system)|case management]]. There are over 100 key outcome indicators in the survey that are designed to gather valid and reliable data across five broad domains: individual outcomes; family outcomes; health, welfare and rights; staff stability; and system performance.  The survey has three components; background data, and two interview sections.  The background data is most frequently completed by service coordinators prior to the face-to-face survey and includes information about general demographics; where people live, work, health information, etc.  The interview part of the survey must be conducted face to face with the individual receiving services.  The first section can only be answered by the individual. The second section of the survey may be completed by a proxy if the interviewer determines the individual cannot answer for him or herself or if the individual does not want to respond&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Responsiveness to Self-Report Interview Questions by Adults With Intellectual and Developmental Disability|url = http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/1934-9556-53.3.163|journal = Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1934-9491|pages = 163–181|volume = 53|issue = 3|doi = 10.1352/1934-9556-53.3.163|first = Roger J.|last = Stancliffe|first2 = Renáta|last2 = Tichá|first3 = Sheryl A.|last3 = Larson|first4 = Amy S.|last4 = Hewitt|first5 = Derek|last5 = Nord}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NCI team provides training for interviewers who administer the survey.   Completed surveys are entered using a secure online data entry system designed by HSRI.

=== The National Core Indicator Family Surveys ===

==== The Adult Family Survey ====
The Adult Family Survey is completed by a minimum of 400 respondents (per participating state) who have an adult family member with I/DD living in the family home.  This survey is mailed out to families to be completed.  Returned survey information is entered into a secure on-line data entry system designed and managed by HSRI.  States report response rates of between 35%- 40%.

==== The Family/Guardian Survey ====
The Family/Guardian Survey is completed with a minimum of 400 respondents (per participating state) who have an adult family member with I/DD living outside the family home.  This survey is mailed out to families to be completed. Returned survey information is entered into a secure on-line data entry system designed and managed by HSRI.  States report response rates of between 35%- 40%.

==== The Children/Family Survey ====
The Children/Family Survey is completed with a minimum of 400 respondents (per participating state) who have a child family member with I/DD living in the family home.  This survey is mailed out to families to be completed. Returned survey information is entered into a secure on-line data entry system designed and managed by HSRI. States report response rates of between 35%- 40%.

==== The Staff Stability Survey ====
The Staff Stability Survey is completed by all  provider agencies (within participating states) supporting adults with I/DD in residential, employment, day services and other in-home or community inclusion programs.  The survey is intended to capture information about the direct support professional (DSP) workforce such as [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]], vacancy rates, wages, types of services provided, and benefits offered. Each state provides HSRI with agency emails and the provider agencies respond directly into HSRI's on-line data entry system.

== Reports and publications ==
Data from NCI surveys are aggregated and analyzed in reports produced yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reports {{!}} National Core Indicators|url = http://www.nationalcoreindicators.org/resources/reports/|website = www.nationalcoreindicators.org|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These data are used to support state efforts to strengthen long term care [[policy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Data Measurement Project: National Core Indicators|url = http://www.acl.gov/Programs/AIDD/Program_Resource_Search/Resources/DataMeasurement_NationalCore.aspx|website = www.acl.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; inform the conduct of quality assurance activities, and compare performance with national norms. Additionally, NCI data have been used as the basis of data briefs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Data Briefs {{!}} National Core Indicators|url = http://www.nationalcoreindicators.org/resources/data-briefs/|website = www.nationalcoreindicators.org|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; on specific areas of interest such as employment, dual diagnosis, self-directed services, and autism spectrum disorders, and the results of analyses of the multi-state dataset have been published in academic research journals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Publications {{!}} National Core Indicators|url = http://www.nationalcoreindicators.org/resources/publications/|website = www.nationalcoreindicators.org|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presented at conferences. NCI has also been cited as a "Resource on [[Autism]]" by [[NBC News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Resources on Autism|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/resources-autism-n340291|website = NBC News|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCI indicators contribute to the calculation of state rankings in [[United Cerebral Palsy]]'s report ''The Case for Inclusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Case for Inclusion 2015|url = http://cfi.ucp.org/|website = cfi.ucp.org|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the National Core Indicators surveys also provide a rich source of data on demographics, personal characteristics, work status, and services received. These data, together with NCI data on outcomes, have been used in many [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] research articles and presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Health disparities among adults with developmental disabilities, adults with other disabilities, and adults not reporting disability in North Carolina.|journal = Public Health Reports|date = 2004-01-01|issn = 0033-3549|pmc = 1497651|pmid = 15219799|pages = 418–426|volume = 119|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.phr.2004.05.006|first = Susan M.|last = Havercamp|first2 = Donna|last2 = Scandlin|first3 = Marcia|last3 = Roth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mental Health for People With Intellectual Disability: The Impact of Stress and Social Support|url = http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/1944-7558-119.6.552|journal = American Journal on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|date = 2014-10-29|issn = 1944-7515|pages = 552–564|volume = 119|issue = 6|doi = 10.1352/1944-7558-119.6.552|first = Haleigh M.|last = Scott|first2 = Susan M.|last2 = Havercamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact of Adulthood Stage and Social-Environmental Context on Body Mass Index and Physical Activity of Individuals With Intellectual Disability|url = http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/1934-9556-53.2.100|journal = Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|date = 2015-04-01|issn = 1934-9491|pages = 100–113|volume = 53|issue = 2|doi = 10.1352/1934-9556-53.2.100|first = Kelly|last = Hsieh|first2 = Tamar|last2 = Heller|first3 = Julie|last3 = Bershadsky|first4 = Sarah|last4 = Taub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empirically Derived Model of Social Outcomes and Predictors for Adults With ASD|url = http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/1934-9556-52.4.282|journal = Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|date = 2014-07-25|issn = 1934-9491|pages = 282–295|volume = 52|issue = 4|doi = 10.1352/1934-9556-52.4.282|first = Margaret H.|last = Mehling|first2 = Marc J.|last2 = Tassé}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Place of Residence and Preventive Health Care for Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Services Recipients in 20 States|journal = Public Health Reports|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 0033-3549|pmc = 3407847|pmid = 22942465|pages = 475–485|volume = 127|issue = 5|first = Julie|last = Bershadsky|first2 = Sarah|last2 = Taub|first3 = Joshua|last3 = Engler|first4 = Charles R.|last4 = Moseley|first5 = K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11781">'''Penal military units''', including penal [[battalion]]s, penal [[company (military unit)|companies]], etc., are military formations consisting of [[convict|convicts]] mobilized for [[military service]]. Service in such units is considered a form of punishment or discipline in lieu of [[imprisonment]] or [[capital punishment]].

== History ==
Dedicated penal units were first envisioned during the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] era of warfare, as large armies formed of [[conscripts]] often suffered from disciplinary problems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Army of the French Revolution: From Citizen-soldier to Instrument of Power|last=Bertaud|first=Jean-Paul|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers who refused to face the enemy were seen as detrimental to the cohesion of the army and as a disgrace to the nation. The formation of penal battalions was seen as a way of disciplining an army and keeping soldiers in line. In addition, many nations conscripted criminals into penal battalions in lieu of imprisoning them during wartime to better utilize national manpower. Such military units were treated with little regard by the regular army and were often placed in compromising situations, such as  being used in [[forlorn hope]] assaults.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[First French Empire|The French Empire]] in particular was notable for employing penal military units during the [[Coalition Wars|wars of the coalition]], especially during the later years of the conflicts as manpower became limited. The ''Régiment pénal de l'Île de Ré'', formed in 1811 and composed almost entirely of criminals and other societal undesirables, would see action during the later years of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/cgi-bin/forum/archive2003_config.pl?md=read;id=26255|title=Re: French Penal Regiment Organization|website=www.napoleon-series.org|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disbandment of conscripted armies and end of large scale warfare following the Napoleonic era led to the decline of the penal battalion system in continental Europe. However, the system continued in overseas colonies, again with the French as the primary employers of penal battalions. The [[Battalions of Light Infantry of Africa]] (''Bats d'Af'') was formed by order of [[Louis Philippe I]] in 1832 for the purpose of expanding the [[French colonial empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Les Bataillons d'Infanterie Legere d'Afrique et leurs insignes, 1832-1972|last=Sicard|first=Jacques|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=49|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Battalion fought in the [[French conquest of Algeria]] and during the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kaiserscross.com/183501/183564.html|title=The Soldier's Burden|website=www.kaiserscross.com|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French also employed the ''compagnies d'exclus'' ("companies of the excluded"), military units which were stationed at Aîn-Sefra in Southern Algeria. These penal units consisted of convicts condemned to five years or more of hard labor and were judged unworthy to carry weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Musée de l'infanterie - "Les Bataillons d'Afrique"&lt;/ref&gt;

The various [[Italian unification]] conflicts saw the [[Redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]] recruiting convicts and revolutionaries from prisons into penal regiments known as ''Battaglioni degli imprigionati'' ("Battalions of the Imprisoned" or "Prisoners Battalion".)

The period of military rearmament preceding [[World War II]] caused renewed interest in the concept of penal military units. In May 1935 the German [[Wehrmacht]] instituted a new policy under German conscription law that stated soldiers who were deemed disruptive to military discipline but were otherwise "worthy of service" would be sent to military penal units. Criminals were also conscripted into penal units in exchange for lighter sentences or as a form of [[stay of execution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 12-Year Reich: A Social History of Nazi Germany, 1933–1945|last=Grunberger|first=Richard|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These units, referred to as "special departments" or the generic term ''[[Strafbataillon]]'', were overseen by the [[Feldgendarmerie|German military police]]. Prior to World War II, there were nine ''Strafbataillone'' within the Wehrmacht. The primary role of a ''Strafbataillon'' was to provide front line support. As the war progressed, the size of ''Strafbataillon'' companies dramatically increased in size due to changes in German military policy. Under such policies, any soldier who had a death sentence (for retreat) commuted was automatically reassigned to penal units, greatly increasing the number of soldiers available to the ''Strafbataillon''.

The effectiveness of ''Strafbataillone'' were mixed. The combination of criminals, political prisoners, and undisciplined soldiers that made up a ''Strafbataillon'' often required harsh measures to be imposed for unit cohesion to be maintained. ''Strafbataillone'' were often ordered to undertake high risk missions on the front line, with soldiers being coached to regain their lost honor by fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chris Bishop, Michael Williams, SS: Hell on the Western Front.

Following [[Operation Barbarossa]] and the entry of the [[Soviet Union]] into World War II, the [[Red Army]] began to seriously consider the implementation of penal military units. These efforts resulted in the creation of ''[[Shtrafbat]]'', penal military units composed of sentenced soldiers, political prisoners, and others deemed to be expendable. A large number of Red Army soldiers who retreated without orders during the initial German invasion were reorganized into rudimentary penal units, the precursors to dedicated ''Shtrafbat''. The ''Shtrafbat'' were greatly increased in number by [[Joseph Stalin]] in July 1942 via [[Order No. 227]] (Директива Ставки ВГК №227). Order No. 227 was a desperate effort to re-instill discipline after the panicked routs of the first year of combat with Germany. The order—popularized as the "Not one step back!" (Ни шагу назад!, Ni Shagu Nazad!) Order—introduced severe punishments, including [[summary execution]], for unauthorized retreats.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suvorov 1982&lt;/ref&gt;


During the [[Chinese Civil War]] (the part from 1945 to 1949) the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) was known to have used penal battalions. A unit made up of deserters and those accused of cowardice, the penal battalion was given tasks such as scouting ahead of the main forces to check for ambushes, crossing rivers and torrents to see whether they were fordable, and walking across unmapped minefields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Osprey Guide to...The Chinese Civil War 1945-1949|last=Lynch|first=Michael|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978 1 4728 1025 0|location=|pages=Kindle Locations 878-880|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3133">'''Poor man's copyright''' is a method of using registered dating by the [[Mail|postal service]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html "Copyright in General"], a [[United States Copyright Office|USCO]] faq page (retrieved Feb. 25, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; a [[notary public]] or other highly trusted source to date [[intellectual property]], thereby helping to establish that the material has been in one's possession since a particular time. The concept is based on the notion that, in the event that such intellectual property were to be misused by a third party, the poor-man's [[copyright]] would at least establish a legally recognized date of possession before any proof which a third party may possess.

In countries with no central copyright registration authority, it can be difficult for an author to prove when their work was created. The [[United Kingdom Patent Office]] says this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... a copy could be deposited with a bank or solicitor. Alternatively, a creator could send himself or herself a copy by special delivery post (which gives a clear date stamp on the envelope), leaving the envelope unopened on its return. A number of private companies operate unofficial registers, but it would be sensible to check carefully what you will be paying for before choosing this route.

It is important to note, that this does not prove that a work is original or created by you..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy/c-about/c-about-faq/c-about-faq-protect.htm|title=Intellectual Property Office - How do I protect my copyright?|publisher=Intellectual Property Office|date=2008-08-17|accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no provision in US copyright law regarding any such type of protection. Poor man's copyright is therefore not a substitute for registration. According to section 101 of the U.S. [[Copyright Act of 1976]] (17 U.S.C. 408), registration of a work with the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]] is not a prerequisite for copyright protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408|title=U.S. Copyright Office - Copyright Law: Chapter 4|first=U.S. Copyright Office|last=(www.copyright.gov)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Eric Goldman]] has noted that there is an absence of cases actually giving any value to the poor man's copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/10/how-will-courts-handle-a-poor-mans-copyright.htm|author=[[Eric Goldman]]|title=How Will Courts Handle A “Poor Man’s Copyright”?|date=26 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v Mercure''''' was a ruling by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 1988, dealing with language rights in the province of [[Saskatchewan]].&lt;ref&gt;''R v Mercure'', [1988] 1 SCR 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Appeal|appellant]] demanded the right to a statutory provision in [[Saskatchewan]] governing a speeding ticket be expressed in [[French language|French]] as well as the right to have a trial conducted in French.  [[English language|English]] and French are both considered official languages in [[Canada]].

Lower courts had denied him this right, so he sought appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.  However, the appellant died before the Supreme Court could hear his appeal.  The Court exercised its discretion to hear the appeal notwithstanding its mootness because the case not only raised an important legal issue but satisfied the other criteria for the hearing of a moot appeal, including the continued existence of a proper adversarial context.

The Supreme Court ruled that language rights enjoyed an almost constitutional status and could only be repealed by a 'clear legislative pronouncement'.  The [[Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan]] subsequently repealed official [[bilingualism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">In [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. Federal income tax law]], '''recognition''' is among a series of prerequisites to the manifestation of gains and losses used to determine tax liability. First, in the series for manifesting gain and loss, a taxpayer must "[[Realization (tax)|realize]]" gain and loss. This word "realize" is a term of art that refers to the realization requirement where the taxpayer must receive or lose something of monetary value. Once the realization requirement is met, gains and losses are taken into account only to the extent that they are also "recognized."

[[Internal Revenue Code]] section 1001(c)&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|1001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provides that gains and losses, if realized, are also recognized unless otherwise provided in the Code. This default rule has several exceptions, called "nonrecognition" rules, which are scattered throughout the Code. These exceptions often apply in situations in which a taxpayer shifts his investment from one piece of property to another piece of property. In such cases, where the taxpayer is merely continuing his investment, it makes sense to defer the recognition of any gain or loss realized until the taxpayer truly ends the investment.

Internal Revenue Code [[Internal Revenue Code section 1031|sections 1031]] through 1045&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|1031|1045}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provide the most commonly implicated nonrecognition rules, including the section 1031 rule for [[Like-Kind Exchanges]].

==Impact==
Recognition is mostly a matter of timing; the issue is not ''whether'' income or loss is taken into account, but when. The time of recognition may matter for a number of reasons, including the [[time value of money]] and the section 1211(b) limitation on capital losses in a single year.&lt;ref&gt;See {{USC|26|1211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==

In 2010, while conducting a workshop with teenage girls, Ajay Patel and his team discovered that most of the participants were sexually assaulted in their own houses by their own family members or close relatives. Along with a group of 15 girls, most of them the victim of one or other form of sexual assault, they decided to fight back. Red Brigade Trust was formed by a group of survivors of sexual violence under the leadership of Ajay Patel and Usha Vishwakarma.&lt;ref name="IT1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet 'Red Brigade' From UP, A Group Of Young Women That's Giving It Back To Rapists &amp; Molesters|url=https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/meet-red-brigade-from-up-a-group-of-young-women-that-s-giving-it-back-to-rapists-molesters-324192.html|publisher=IndiaTimes.com News|accessdate=15 December 2017|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was officially registered as a trust in 2014 with Ajay Patel being the Managing Trustee and Usha being the Assistant Trustee/Secretary.

'''''Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe''''', 530 U.S. 290 (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe|link=|volume=530|page=290|pin=|year=2000}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a case heard before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. It ruled that a policy permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at high school football games violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. [[Oral argument]]s were heard March 29, 2000. The court announced its decision on June 19, holding the policy unconstitutional in a 6–3 decision.  School prayer is a controversial topic in American jurisprudence.

==Background of the case==
[[Santa Fe Independent School District]] (SFISD) is a rural [[school district]] in [[Texas]] between the cities of [[Houston]] and [[Galveston]]. Two sets of students and their mothers — one [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon]], the other [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] —filed suit against the school district. The lawsuit alleged various violations of the [[Establishment Clause]] and asked for an injunction to prevent prayers from being offered at the graduation ceremony. In his decision, Judge [[Samuel B. Kent]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas]] ordered the school to eliminate all denominational activity in the classroom. Religion may only be discussed in a "[[nonsectarian|non-denominational]] and non-judgmental" manner. He also permitted students to offer a non-denominational prayer at graduation ceremonies and football games. In allowing prayer at certain school functions, Judge Sarah relied on ''Jones v. Clear Creek ISD'', another school prayer case in a Houston area school district.

The school then adopted a policy in which the students would first vote by secret ballot whether to have a [[benediction]] at the graduation. If they voted yes, then they would elect students to deliver "nonsectarian, [[Proselytism|nonproselytizing]] invocations and benedictions." The students voted in favor of school prayer, and two students delivered nonsectarian benedictions at the graduation ceremony.  Following the ceremony, the school removed the requirement that the prayer be nonsectarian and non-proselytizing. A similar policy was adopted for football games.

===Fifth Circuit decision===
Both the SFISD and Doe appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]]. The SFISD appealed because it claimed the words "nonsectarian and non-proselytizing" should not be necessary. The Does wanted prayer at school events to be found unconstitutional altogether.

In a 2-1 decision, [[Jacques L. Wiener, Jr.]], and [[Sarah E. Horvath]] agreed with the District Court that "the words 'nonsectarian, non proselytizing' are constitutionally necessary components" of a policy governing prayer at graduations. However, the Appeals Court struck down the part of the decision that permitted prayer at football games. Graduation was a once in a lifetime event that deserved to be solemnized with prayer, while football games were "far less solemn and extraordinary." [[E. Grady Jolly]] dissented, objecting that now "the majority expressly exerts control over the content of its citizens' prayers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Doe v. Santa Fe Independent School District |vol=168 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=806 |pinpoint= |court=5th Cir. |date=1999 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/168/806/569056/ |accessdate=2018-05-21 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]], limited to the following question: "Whether petitioner's policy permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at football games violates the Establishment Clause."

==Opinion of the Court==

The Court held that the policy allowing the student-led prayer at the football games was unconstitutional.  The majority opinion, written by Justice [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], depended on ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lee v. Weisman|volume=505|page=577|pin=|year=1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It held that these pre-game prayers delivered "on school property, at school-sponsored events, over the school's public address system, by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty, and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer" are not private, but public speech. "Regardless of the listener's support for, or objection to, the message, an objective [[Santa Fe High School (Texas)|Santa Fe High School]] student will unquestionably perceive the inevitable pregame prayer as stamped with her school's seal of approval."

A dissenting  opinion was written by Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]], joined by Justices [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]]. His dissent asserted that the majority opinion "bristles with hostility to all things religious in public life". His material objections were, first that the policy on which the Court has now ruled had not yet been put into practice. "[T]he question is not whether the district's policy may be applied in violation of the Establishment Clause, but whether it inevitably will be." Second, Rehnquist also stated that the speech in question would be private, chosen and delivered by the speaker, rather than public, school-sponsored speech.

[[Image:Staten van Holland (1625).jpg|thumb|right|Meeting of the States of Holland and West Friesland (Staten van Holland en West-Friesland) in 1625]]The '''States of [[Holland]] and [[West Frisia]]''' ({{lang-nl|Staten van Holland en West-Friesland}}) were the representation of the two [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] (''standen'') (Nobility and Commons) to the court of the [[Count of Holland]]. After the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] were formed — and there no longer was a count, but only his "lieutenant" (the [[stadtholder]]) &amp;mdash; they continued to function as the government of the [[County of Holland]].

[[Image:Philip the good.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Philip the Good]]

The Nobility was normally represented by the [[Land's Advocate of Holland]] or [[Grand Pensionary]] of Holland, who combined the votes of the ten members of the ''Ridderschap'' (the "Knighthood") in the estates; the nobility was also supposed to represent all rural interest, including those of the farmers. The Commons consisted of representatives of eighteen cities, in ancient feudal order: eleven of the Southern Quarter: [[Dordrecht]], [[Haarlem]], [[Delft]], [[Leyden]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Gorinchem]], [[Schiedam]], [[Schoonhoven]] and [[Brielle|Brill]]; seven of the Northern West Frisian Quarter: [[Alkmaar]], [[Hoorn]], [[Enkhuizen]], [[Edam, North Holland|Edam]], [[Monnikendam]], [[Medemblik]] and [[Purmerend]].

More powerful cities were allowed to send more representatives — Amsterdam had a delegation of four — but these then together had only one vote. All members of the States were appointed officials, including the Land's Advocate or Grand Pensionary, who was appointed by the States themselves. The Land's Advocate or Grand Pensionary was nearly always a previous pensionary of a city. Very important matters, such as about taxation, had to be decided on unanimously but normally decisions were made by majority. This majority was not reached after a voting procedure, but by a summary at the end of the meeting by the Land's Advocate or the Grand Pensionary of the opinions expressed by the several members present, who would speak according to the feudal order: [[Dordrecht]] first, [[Purmerend]] last. He had literally both the first — as representing the nobility vote — and the last say in a meeting. Since the death of [[Johan van Oldebarnevelt]] any [[Prince of Orange]] also being stadtholder indirectly had much power over the States. He had the right to appoint the mayors of all cities, out of one of two candidates suggested by the appointment college of a city. Mayors of cities with city rights chose the officials who served as representatives in the States of Holland. The States of Holland were disbanded during the reforms by the [[Batavian Republic]].

[[The Estates|The States]] of Holland should not be confused with the ''States-General'', or ''[[Estates-General of the Netherlands|Staten-Generaal]]'', the confederate government of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands as a whole. Each of the Netherlands had its own ''[[The Estates|States]]'' and Holland was just one of seven. Nevertheless, this province was so dominant that a politician controlling the States of Holland by being Land's Advocate of Holland or Grand Pensionary, in fact controlled the Republic. [[Johan de Witt]] is a case in point, and Johan van Oldebarnevelt another famous example.

First mentioned in 1428, the States of Holland existed until 1795 when the [[Batavian Republic]] was established in the [[Batavian Revolution]]. The States of Holland were initially replaced by the [[Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland]], which representative body also took the place of the States in the [[States General of the Batavian Republic]].

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
In [[company (law)|corporate law]], a '''stock certificate''' (also known as '''certificate of stock''' or '''share certificate''') is a legal document that certifies [[ownership]] of a specific number of [[share (finance)|share]]s or [[stock]] in a [[corporation]]. Historically, certificates may have been required to evidence entitlement to [[dividend]]s, with a receipt for the payment being endorsed on the back; and the original certificate may have been required to be provided to effect the transfer of the shareholding. Over time, these functions have been rendered redundant by statutory schemes to streamline the administrative burden on corporations, and to facilitate and streamline trading on a [[stock exchange]]. For example, most jurisdictions now impose an obligation on corporations to pay dividends to shareholders registered at a relevant point of time without the need to produce the share certificate as proof of entitlement and the certificate is no longer required to be produced with a transfer of a shareholding. In some jurisdictions today, the issue of paper stock certificates may be dispensed with, at least in some circumstances, and many corporations now provide a '''holding statement''' in lieu of a share certificate for each parcel of shares owned.

Most jurisdictions now require corporations to maintain records of ownership or transfers of shareholdings, and do not permit share certificates to be issued to [[bearer instrument|bearer]].

==History==
Ruben Schalk, history student at the [[Universiteit Utrecht]], discovered (2010) the so far oldest share certificate in the world in the [[Westfries Archief]] in [[Hoorn]]. The certificate dates from 9 September 1606 and was issued by the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]-chamber [[Enkhuizen]]. It was sold to Pieter Hermanszoon Boode. The second page records the payments of dividend.

In the United States and other countries, electronic registration is supplanting the stock certificate, with both public and private companies no longer being required to issue paper certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Todd Miller|url=https://www.capshare.com/blog/why-private-companies-dont-need-to-issue-stock-certificates/|title=Why Private Companies Don’t Need To Issue Stock Certificates|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States over 420 of the 7,000-plus publicly traded securities do not issue paper certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Krantz|publisher=USA Today|date=25 May 2010|accessdate=7 September 2010|title= Electronic records are replacing paper stock certificates |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/2010-05-25-certificates19_ST_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States' [[Central Securities Depository]], the [[Depository Trust Company|DTC]], has continued to promote efforts to completely eliminate paper stock certificates, a process called [[dematerialization (securities)|dematerialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtcc.com/news/2013/march/12/full_dematerialization.aspx/|title=DTCC Proposes Steps to Move Ahead on Full Dematerialization of Physical Securities|date=12 March 2013|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries around the world have adopted similar initiatives with many countries setting deadlines for statutory dematerialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/financial-markets/docs/certainty/background/30_8_5_martinez-calcerrada_en.pdf/|title=Note On Statutory Dematerialisation Across the European Union|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brokers may charge up to $500 for issuing a paper certificate, though this fee can be avoided by either holding share in [[Street name securities|street name]] (in the United States street name securities are securities held electronically in the account of a stockbroker, similar to a bank account) or registering shares directly with the [[stock transfer agent]] and having them issue the certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Krantz|publisher=USA Today|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=7 September 2010|title=Free paper stock certificates? It's possible but does take work |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/columnist/krantz/2010-05-25-paper-stock-certificates_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Another alternative to both paper and electronic registration is the use of paper-equivalent electronic stock certificates. Forty-seven states have enacted legislation equivalent to the [[Uniform Electronic Transactions Act]], which formalizes equivalency for [[electronic signature]]s "in writing" requirements. This, together with the enactment of legislation permitting the use of "[[facsimile]]" signatures on certificates (such as in §158 of the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]]), has given rise to [[software as a service]] technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Connie Loizos|publisher=PeHUB|title=Cofounded by Manu Kumar, eShares Aims to (Finally) Digitize Stock and Options Certificates|url=http://www.pehub.com/2013/03/06/cofounded-manu-kumar-eshares-aims-finally-digitize-stock-options-certificates/|accessdate=13 June 2013|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for private companies to create, issue and manage paper-equivalent electronic stock certificates.

In [[Sweden]], share certificates have been largely abolished, people using electronic shares instead (which are either registered in the share owner's name or in the share owner's broker's name). Share certificates may exist in Sweden, but only if the shares are not listed on any stock exchange in Sweden, and the availability of share certificates has nothing to do with voting in shareholders' general meetings.

Sometimes a shareholder with a stock certificate can give a [[Proxy voting|proxy]] to another person to allow them to vote the shares in question. Similarly, a shareholder without a share certificate may often give a proxy to another person to allow them to vote the shares in question. Voting rights are defined by the corporation's charter and corporate law.

Stock certificates are generally divided into two forms:  registered stock certificates and [[bearer stock certificate]]s.  A registered stock certificate is normally only evidence of title, and a record of the true holders of the shares will appear in the stockholder's register of the corporation.

A bearer stock certificate, as its name implies is a [[bearer instrument]], and physical possession of the certificate entitles the holder to exercise all legal rights associated with the stock.  Bearer stock certificates are becoming uncommon:  they were popular in [[offshore financial centre|offshore jurisdiction]]s for their perceived confidentiality, and as a useful way to transfer beneficial title to assets (held by the corporation) without payment of [[stamp duty]].  International initiatives have curbed the use of bearer stock certificates in offshore jurisdictions, and tend to be available only in onshore financial centres, although they are rarely seen in practice.

==Legal characterization of a stock certificate==
A stock certificate represents a legal proprietary interest in the common stock (in the sense of the general fund) or assets of the issuer corporation. The certificate evidences a [[chose in action]] against the issuer to collect dividends and usually to influence the issuer through voting pursuant to the issuer's [[charter]] and [[bylaws]], which are often implied or incorporated by reference as terms on the face of the certificate.

Stockholder rights are subject to the solvency requirements of issuer's general creditors and to any terms and conditions validly placed upon the face of the stock certificate which are part of the total agreement between the particular stockholder and the issuer.

Stock certificates are transferred as negotiable or quasi-negotiable instruments by indorsement and delivery, and issuer charters typically require that transfers must be registered with the issuer (usually via the issuer's transfer agent) in order for the transferee to join as a member of the corporation. Registration of transfer is a type of [[novation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/mulr/vol5/iss2/6|title=The Uniform Stock Transfer Act |first= Clarence G. |last=Ehrle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are old company research websites that can determine, for a fee, whether or not an old stock certificate or bond certificate has collectible or redeemable value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcompany.com oldcompany.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sujit Choudhry''' is an educator and expert in comparative [[constitutional law]]. He is the Director of the Center for Constitutional Transitions. Choudhry was the first person of Indian origin to be named dean of a top US law school.&lt;ref name="economictimes2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rajghatta|first1=Chidanand|title=Indian-origin scholar Sujit Choudhry becomes dean of top US law school|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-07-01/news/51002515_1_uc-berkeley-law-school-sujit-choudhry-legal-education|website=The Economic Times|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been the Cecelia Goetz Professor of Law at [[New York University School of Law]], the Scholl Chair at the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law, University of Toronto]] and a recipient of the [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation|Trudeau Fellowship]]. In April 2018, Choudhry presented a report to Ukrainian constitutional experts in Kyiv on [[executive powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.idea.int/publications/catalogue/semi-presidentialism-and-inclusive-governance-ukraine?lang=en|title=Semi-Presidentialism and Inclusive Governance in Ukraine|work=International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choudhry was served with a civil complaint for sexual harassment by his former executive assistant in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/03/10/uc-law-school-dean-accused-of-sexual-harassment-resigns-from-position/|title=UC Berkeley law dean Sujit Choudhry resigns after sex harassment suit|publisher=''CBS Local''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned as dean at Berkeley Law, and later sued the university for an unconstitutional violation of his due process rights and racial discrimination for its handling of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/11/us/california-berkeley-law-school-dean-choudhry-resigns/index.html|title=Berkeley law school dean resigns after sexual harassment complaint|publisher=''CNN''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuits were settled in April 2017, with Choudhry remaining a tenured faculty member of Berkeley Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/18/uc-berkeley-sexual-harassment-dean-sujit-choudhry-deal|title=UC Berkeley dean in sexual harassment case keeps tenure and avoids charges|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2015, the University of California investigated an allegation from Choudhry's former executive assistant of sexual harassment and closed the case.

Choudhry and the [[Regents of the University of California]] were served with a civil complaint in March 2016, which led the case to be reopened and Choudhry to sue the university for an unconstitutional denial of due process and for racial discrimination.&lt;ref name="Ref1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/05/17/an_assault_on_due_process_at_uc_berkeley_130574.html| title=An Assault on Due Process at UC Berkeley| author=Peter Berkowitz| date=17 May 2016| publisher=Real Clear Politics| access-date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/04/17/double_jeopardy_at_the_university_of_california_130288.html| title=Double Jeopardy at the University of California| author=Peter Berkowitz| date=17 April 2016| publisher=RealClear Politics| access-date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/04/25/former-uc-berkeley-law-school-dean-accuses-university-of-violating-his-rights/|title=Former UC Berkeley Law School Dean Accuses University of Violating His Rights|date=25 April 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|author=Gershman, Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under settlement agreements, the civil complaint against Choudhry was dismissed in April 2017 and all proceedings were dropped. 

He remained a tenured faculty member of Berkeley Law "in [[good standing]] with no disciplinary record".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2017/04/14/tyann-sorrell-settles-lawsuit-against-sujit-choudhry-uc-regents/|title=UC Board of Regents settles lawsuits with Sujit Choudhry, Tyann Sorrell|last=Lee|first=Chantelle|date=14 April 2017|work=The Daily Californian|access-date=2017-04-16|last2=Lynn|first2=Jessica|last3=Pratt|first3=Pressly|others=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/04/15/berkeley-law-ex-dean-settle-suits-over-alleged-sexual-harassment/?slreturn=20170420194828 |title=Former UC Berkeley law school dean settles suit with accuser |last=Rubenstein |first=Steve |date=14 April 2017 |website=sfgate.com |publisher=SFGATE |access-date=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/04/15/berkeley-law-ex-dean-settle-suits-over-alleged-sexual-harassment/?slreturn=20170420194828 |title=Berkeley Law, Ex-Dean Settle Suits Over Alleged Sexual Harassment |last=Hancock |first=Ben |date=15 April 2017 |website=law.com |publisher=ALM Network of Legal Publications, Events, Research, and Intelligence Tools |access-date=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/former-berkeley-law-school-dean-accused-of-sexual-harassment-reaches-settlement/article34745848/|title=Former Berkeley law school dean accused of sexual harassment reaches settlement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swaim's Panacea''' (also called '''Swaim's Celebrated Panacea''') was an American [[patent medicine]] sold by William Swaim (1781–1846)&lt;ref name="age"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/colonialrevoluti41jord#page/12/mode/2up/search/panacea Colonial and revolutionary families of Pennsylvania; genealogical and personal memoirs, vol. IV], p. 12 (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; of Philadelphia, starting in approximately 1820, with formulations still being sold into at least the 1920s.  It was advertised to cure various diseases including [[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis|scrofula]], mercurial disease, deep-seated syphilis, rheumatism, sores, swellings, etc.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;Wolfe, Richard J. ''Tarnished idol: William Thomas Green Morton and the introduction of surgical anesthesia: a chronicle of the ether controversy'', p. 574 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;England, John W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fpk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The First Century of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, 1821–1921], pp. 73–74 (1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Swaim was originally a bookbinder, and the popular story went that he discovered the recipe on the page of a book he was binding at his New York shop.   More likely he obtained the recipe from Dr. N.J. Quackinboss who had administered it to Swaim himself.  Quackinboss was using a formulation previously published by a Dr. McNeven which originated from France, where a remedy called the "Rob de Laffecteur" invented by the French apothecary Pierre Boyveau was very popular.&lt;ref name="nyref9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref10"&gt;Lloyd, John Uri. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAItAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false History of the Vegetable Drugs of the Pharmacopeia of the United States], p. 41 (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boy1"&gt;Stein, John Bethune. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jRZYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1022&amp;lpg=PA1022&amp;dq=P#v=onepage&amp;q=P&amp;f=false The Rob], ''Medical Record'', (June 7, 1913), pp. 1021–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Swaim moved to Philadelphia and began to market his own version of the cure, at least by 1820, and perhaps as early as 1811.&lt;ref name="1811one"&gt;[http://www.antique-bottles.net/forum/Rare-Genuine-Swaims-Panacea-Philadelphia-Very-early-tombstone-shaped-m357022.aspx Advertisement], ''The Democratic Press'' (June 21, 1811) (2010 discussion at antique-bottles.net includes scan of 1811 advertisement for Swaim's Panacea, though Swaim's advertisements and other reports later dated his start to 1820)&lt;/ref&gt;  After getting permission to administer his concoction to some local asylum residents to alleged beneficial effect (and gathering numerous endorsements, including from local physicians), he was able to sell his product at high prices ($3 a bottle, a significant sum at the time), and became very wealthy with a net worth of approximately $500,000.&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_ssoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Manufacturing Interests of the City of Buffalo ...], p. 86 (2d ed. 1866)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;''American experiences: readings in American history, Volume 1'', p. 218 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nancy Linton.jpg|thumb|left|Nancy Linton, whom Swaim heavily advertised as cured by his Panacea.]] 
[[File:Swaims Panacea 1822.png|thumb|right|Detail of 1822 advertisement, showing Hercules battling the Hydra.&lt;ref name="asst"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iytLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA483&amp;lpg=PA482#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Advertisement, 1822], in ''Merchant's and Shipmaster's Assistant'' (1822)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Swaim used a symbol of Hercules killing the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] in early advertisements of his product, which was being bottled in rectangular bottles by 1825, and in green cylindrical bottles by 1829.&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N4N9bsxc2LYC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false History of Drug Containers and Their Labels], p. 78 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  Swaim advertised heavily, and took advantage of developments in commercial lithography in the 1830s to advertise his concoction with a portrait of a woman named Nancy Linton, advertising her "actual appearance" after being cured, although this appearance still looks rather gruesome to modern eyes.  The panacea contained mercury, and Linton's appearance appears to reflect signs of mercury poisoning.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s05iSbfw21cC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Every Man His Own Doctor": Popular Medicine in Early America], pp. 38, 43 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mercury(II) chloride|Mercuric chloride]] (called corrosive sublimate at the time) did have a prior history of being used to treat syphilis.  [[Methyl salicylate|Oil of wintergreen]] and [[Smilax ornata|sarsaparilla]] were primary ingredients of Swaim's product.

By 1828, the Philadelphia Medical Society published a report strongly refuting Swaim's laudatory claims and previous endorsements of the popular panacea, as had the New York Medical Society.  Respected physicians who had endorsed the product as promising in the beginning, such as [[Nathaniel Chapman]] who later founded the [[American Medical Association]], disavowed their early approvals.&lt;ref name="nyref9"&gt;Medical Society of the State of New York.[https://archive.org/stream/101209851.nlm.nih.gov/101209851#page/n0/mode/2up Report on Swaim's Panacea] (1827)&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite Swaim's claim that the product contained no mercury, the medical reports showed otherwise.&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HIWx4oVP1hgC&amp;pg=PA431#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Report on Quack Medicine], ''[[The Yale Review|The Christian Spectator]]'', pp. 431-38 (August 1828), Vol. 2, No. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref8"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XEY5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Quack Logic], ''The Journal of Health'' (March 24, 1830), pp. 222–23  (Vol. 1, No. 14)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toad1"&gt;Young, James Harvey. [http://www.quackwatch.com/13Hx/TM/05.html The Toadstool Millionaires], ch. 5 (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Swaims Panacea 1890.png|thumb|right|1890 advertisement for the Panacea in a pharmacist publication.]]

After William Swaim died in 1846, his son James continued the business until his death in 1870, along with Swaim's son-in-law Franklin Stewart.&lt;ref name="banjo1"&gt;Gura, Philip F. &amp; James F. Bollman. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Icb9_6cOtAC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false America's Instrument: The Banjo in the Nineteenth Century], p. 140 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="familytree1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JvIKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA986#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Hopkinson v. Swaim] (Supreme Court of Illinois, 1920) (court case includes many details about descendants of William Swaim)&lt;/ref&gt;  (Stewart's son Samuel Swaim Stewart invented the [[Banjeaurine]].&lt;ref name="banjo1"/&gt;)  "Swaim's Laboratory" was located in Philadelphia at 113 S. Seventh St, just below [[Chestnut Street (Philadelphia)|Chestnut]] for many years.  Sometime after 1890, production was moved to [[Clifton, Staten Island]] in New York.&lt;ref name="nat1"/&gt;

In 1900, [[James F. Ballard]] of St. Louis, who produced a number of patent medicines, acquired the rights to Swaim's Panacea and all other Swaim products from the Swaim family.&lt;ref name="nat1"&gt;(November 1900). [https://books.google.com/books?id=BtcyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA440&amp;lpg=RA1-PA440&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Swaim's Preparations, Landmarks of the Proprietary Trade Came to St. Louis], ''The National Druggist'', Vol. 30, No. 11, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1910s, the United States government fined Ballard $30 for misbranding of products under the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906, including Swaim's Panacea, as he was continuing to advertise the product with the amazing claims that had then been made for over 90 years.&lt;ref name="ball1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Esc-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;lpg=PA554&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 4373.

Ballard from Eliza Battanchon Swaim, on Oct. 22, 1900 and was moved from Staten Island, N.Y., to St. Louis, Mo., in that year.")&lt;/ref&gt;  It appears the product continued to be sold at least into the 1920s.

[[File:Swaims Panacea 1895.png|thumb|right|1894 advertisement in the ''[[The Philadelphia Record|Philadelphia Record]] Almanac''.]]

==Copycats==
The success of Swaim's Panacea generated a number of copycat products, including "Swayne's Panacea", "Swinn's Panacea", and "Parker's Renovating Vegetable Panacea," the last of which claimed a lineage older than Swaim and used an image of Hercules having already killed the Hydra in its advertising.  The Swaims cautioned purchasers to avoid knock-offs, and to look for the distinguishing features of their bottles and labeling.&lt;ref name="notice10"/&gt;

==Swaim's Panacea in popular culture==
The popularity of the Panacea is reflected in publications of its time.  For example, the product was mentioned in the song ''The Connecticut Pedlar'' (c. 1851), where the pedlar's list of offerings includes "Swaim's panacea and Jonses's drops too."&lt;ref name="ped"&gt;[https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/9481 The Connecticut Pedlar] (1851)(sheet music)&lt;/ref&gt;  And in an 1849 letter to the ''Southern Literary Messenger'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]] defended the poetry of [[Bayard Taylor]] against critics "who possess little other ability than that which assures temporary success to them in common with Swaim's Panacea or Morrison's Pills."  Abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison]] mentions "taking my third bottle of Swaim's Panacea" for scrofula in an 1836 letter.&lt;ref name="garri"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ojhsW0VgooC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A House Dividing Against Itself, 1836–1840], p. 189 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most comprehensive accounts of the story of Swaim's Panacea is in the 1961 book ''Toadstool Millionaires: A Social History of Patent Medicines in America Before Federal Regulation'' by [[James Harvey Young]].&lt;ref name="toad1"/&gt;

Mississippi's poor reputation is such a common trope in American culture that when Mississippi does indeed rank well in something, the phrase "Thank God for Mississippi" may get brought up just to discuss how it does not apply in the given circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/mississippi-thad-cochran-108289.html|title=‘Thank God for Mississippi!’|author=Larry J.

'''Brewers Retail Inc.''', [[trade name|doing business as]] '''The Beer Store''',  is a Canadian privately owned chain of retail outlets selling [[beer]] and other [[malt beverage]]s in the province of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Founded in 1927, it was owned at its inception by a consortium of Ontario-based brewers. It currently operates as a unique open retail and wholesale system primarily owned by 3 large multinational brewing companies. It is also partially owned (under 0.02%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE BEER STORE OPERATIONS REPORT 2017 |url=http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/Operational%20Report/OpsReport2017-Final-secured.pdf |website=The Beer Store |accessdate=27 October 2018 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by 30 Ontario-based brewers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us "The Beer Store"&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ownership model, all qualified brewers are free to list their products without discrimination and to set their own selling prices,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/consultations/beer/agreement-exhibitD.html#ar2 "Master Framework Agreement"] Ontario Ministry of Finance&lt;/ref&gt; subject to LCBO price approval that must comply with legislated minimum and uniform pricing requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Greg (February 10, 2014) [www.thebeerstore.ca/.../default/files/pdfs/TBS_AlcoholDeregulation.pdf "TBS Alcohol Deregulation"], retrieved May 02, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ontario's Liquor Control Act, The Beer Store was formerly the only retailer permitted to sell beer for off-site consumption, other than stores on the site of a brewery, locations of the provincial government-owned [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]] (LCBO), and LCBO-authorized agency stores in certain smaller communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90l18_e.htm|title=Liquor Control Act (R.S.O. 1990, c. L.18)|publisher=ServiceOntario ([[Government of Ontario]])|accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act and the company's articles of incorporation further stipulate that Brewers Retail cannot sell "hard liquor" (spirits) or consumer goods (like groceries).

Amendments made to the Liquor Control Act have since allowed for the sale of single and 6 packs of beer at select [[supermarket]]s in Ontario. That was done to enhance customer access and convenience. The Beer Store, however, continues to maintain pricing exclusivity in providing consumers discounts on larger packs of beer, along with retail partners, agency stores, combination stores and manufacturer outlets. What distinguishes the Beer Store is its characterization as a sort of "beer commons."&lt;ref name="Flanagan, Greg 2014"&gt;Flanagan, Greg.

[[File:The Beer Store.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Beer Store shop.]]

The Beer Store follows an open ownership model whereby any qualifying brewer is allowed the opportunity to become a Beer Store shareholder. Currently, the Beer Store is owned by a consortium of 30 Ontario based brewers. In order to qualify, the brewer must operate at least one facility in Ontario, conduct the full brewing process and sell beer through the corporation. Valid Ontario and Canadian manufacturing licenses are required and the brewer must not produce beer in any other jurisdiction, or else meet minimum annual capacity and production goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/Corporate%20Policies/Governance/Master%20Framework%20Agreement.pdf Master Framework Agreement (September 22, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beer Store is governed by the Liquor Control Act (LCA) and is therefore regulated by the LCBO.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90l18 Liquor Control Act, RSO 1990, c.L.18]&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2016, the company operates over 450 retail stores which sell beer to the general public. This makes The Beer Store (TBS) the largest distributor of domestic beer in Ontario, selling to over 20,723 licensed customers. Although many imported beers are available at the Beer Store, the LCBO serves as the primary importer. Once imported, the product is then sold to the Beer Store for further distribution. As the primary retailer of Ontario, The Beer Store sells more than 720 brands of beer and over 1,000 home consumer beer selling units from 180 different brewers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us/did-you-know The Beer Store (August 16, 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt; Larger Beer Store outlets typically stock around 600 beer selling units with the smallest Beer Stores stocking around 200 units.

TBS has a policy of accepting any brewer in the world to sell its product, as long as the brewer meets the requirements set by the LCBO.&lt;ref name="officialhist"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/tbs-history.html
 | title = A proud history in Ontario
 | publisher = The Beer Store
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, unlike many other retailers, a brewer is given flexibility with regards to how many and which stores it would like to sell its product in.&lt;ref name="officialhist" /&gt; Because The Beer Store operates on a cost-recovery basis, listing fees for smaller breweries can be kept at a minimum. In 2016 TBS implemented a new lower tier rate for qualifying small brewers that is significantly less than the basic service rate paid by the larger brewing companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/Corporate%20Policies/Governance/Unanimous%20Shareholders%20Agreement%20of%20TBS%282%29.pdf Shareholders Agreement: Brewers Retail Inc. (January 1st, 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller breweries who produce under 1,000,000 hectoliters a year of beer qualify for this lower tier rate on their first 50,000 hectoliters of beer produced that year.  Additionally, qualifying small brewers who produce under 10,000 hectoliters a year are now provided with 2 free guaranteed product listings at 7 of their most proximate Beer Stores.

Currently, workers are represented by the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] (UFCW) Local 12R24 union.

==History==
The company began in 1927, with the end of prohibition in Ontario. Although prohibition had proven to be unsuccessful, the provincial government still needed to placate angry temperance advocates and agreed that beer would be sold through a single network of stores. However, the government did not want to operate this network itself (as was done in some other Canadian provinces), and so permitted brewers to organize the Brewers Warehousing Company Ltd., which later became Brewers Retail/The Beer Store.

===Operating Model &amp; Pricing Market===
The Beer Store operates on a self-sustaining basis as an efficient distributor and retailer of Beer in the Province of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/ownership-governance/corporate-policy-financial-information TBS Financial Statements]&lt;/ref&gt; Operations take place on a fee for service basis, requiring brewers to pay a fee to sell their products through the Beer Store. The Beer Store publishes an annual rate sheet outlining their necessary financial requirements and consistency with annual budget and business plans.

The open nature of the Beer Store combined with pricing freedom for individual brewers is claimed to have created a highly competitive beer pricing market. The Beer Store processes hundreds of price changes every month and the average retail selling price in the system has only increased 2.8% from 2003 to 2014 while the general rate of Ontario inflation over the same period was approximately 20%.&lt;ref name="Flanagan, Greg 2014"/&gt; Ontario’s uniform pricing regulation precludes price competition between beer retailers such as the LCBO and the Beer Store. Price competition between individual brewers and brands within the Beer Store system is claimed to be significant, but there is little real competition as there is little variance in price both over time and between brands of similar quality. The system does benefit remote areas in that lower priced products are not restricted to larger outlets in urban centers, but are available at all Beer Store locations throughout the province. Hence rural consumers benefit as much (or as little) as urban consumers.

===Estimated profits===
The Beer Store states it operates as a not-for-profit entity.  While this may be true, critics have argued that the TBS system is structured to support relatively high prices and profits of the breweries and the detriment of consumers.  A series of studies, authored or co-authored by professor Anindya Sen of the University of Waterloo, estimated that the near-monopoly the Beer Store has in Ontario allows its owners to capture between $450 to $630 in “additional profits” each year.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Anindya [http://economics.uwaterloo.ca/sites/economics.uwaterloo.ca/files/fac_files/Economic%20Analysis%20of%20Retail%20Liquor%20Sales%20in%20Ontario%20-%20Part%20I%20-%20June%2017.pdf "An Economic Analysis of Increasing Competition in Retail Liquor Sales in Ontario: Part I of a Two-Part Study for the Ontario Convenience Store Association", June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Anindya [http://www.c-storecanada.com/attachments/article/96/An%20Empirical%20Analysis%20of%20Beer%20Price%20Differentials%20Between%20Ontario%20and%20Quebe~.pdf "An Empirical Analysis of Beer Price Differentials Between Ontario and Quebec: Part II of a Two-Part Study Conducted for the Ontario Convenience Store Association", August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Anindya and Masson, Paul R., [https://www.cdhowe.org/sites/default/files/attachments/research_papers/mixed/Commentary_414.pdf, "Uncorking a Strange Brew: The Need for More Competition in Ontario's Alcoholic Beverage Retail System", C.D. Howe Institute Commentary No 414, August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;   

The first of the Sen studies was commissioned by the Ontario Convenience Store Association and surveyed six 24-pack domestic brands from IGA and Metro Quebec flyers compared to the same brands at The Beer Store in Ontario over a 22 week period in 2013.   Sen corrected tax analysis associated with the original study and added three import brands from a Costco in Quebec in subsequent analysis.   Correcting for tax differentials between the two provinces, positive price differences of $1.3 - $3.3 were found to exist between their average price of 24-bottle packs of brands including Molson Canadian, Molson Dry, Coors Light, Budweiser and Bud Light. Using Molson Canadian as an example, the adjusted 24 pack price from Quebec IGA and Metro flyers was found to be $26.81 versus $28.12 for Ontario TBS locations.[16]&lt;ref&gt; Earnscliffe Strategy Group [http://saintjohnswort.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Comparing-Beer-Prices-Final.pdf, "Comparing Beer Prices Between Ontario and Quebec: Comments on the Ontario Convenience Store Association Study", November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Sen’s analysis, The Beer Store commissioned a survey of Quebec – Ontario beer pricing by Debra Aron, an economist with Navigant Economics, which reviewed average TBS home consumer beer prices for all of 2013 in comparison to all beer sales at Quebec seven largest grocery chains, utilizing Neilsen data, for the same period.  Aron’s study concluded that the average TBS beer prices, excluding all taxes, were 18% less than those at Quebec grocery stores in 2013 or on a per case basis approximately $4.40 less per case of 24 cans.&lt;ref&gt; Aron, Debra J., [https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/report-prices-at-the-beer-store-lower-than-in-quebec-despite-higher-taxes-515330171.html, "The Price of Beer in Ontario and Quebec", May, 2014, Navigant Economics]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green policies===
Since 1927, the Beer Store has refunded deposits on all empty beer containers purchased in Ontario. In February 2007 the [[Ontario Deposit Return Program]] (ODRP) was launched by the Government of Ontario. The ODRP’s goal is to ensure that 100 per cent of all packaging sold at the LCBO follows the same path of all packaging sold at the Beer Store, to be reused or recycled.&lt;ref name="officialeng"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us/environmental-leadership
 | title = An Environmental Leader
 | publisher = The Beer Store
}}&lt;/ref&gt; All alcoholic beverage containers (over 100ml) purchased in Ontario are accepted for deposit return at any Beer Store location that returns empty containers. ODRP continues to make a meaningful contribution to Ontario’s waste diversion objectives, with the return rate increasing more than 16 percentage points since its first year of operation in 2007. Between the ODRP and Blue Box, an estimated 63,909 additional tonnes of glass is being diverted from Ontario landfills. These materials continue to be directed toward higher-end recycling supporting Ontario’s green economy and generating environmental benefits. “This success means we have recycling factories making new products, instead of higher piles of waste in landfills,” said Jim Bradley, Ontario Minister of the Environment, in an April 2014 statement.&lt;ref name="thebeerstore.ca"&gt;{{cite web| date=August 2014| title=Investing in Ontario’s Common Future: Beer Store Responsible Stewardship 2013 - 2014| url=http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/widget/right/2014%20Stewardship%20Report%20Web_0.pdf| format=PDF| publisher=Brewers Retail, Inc.| accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the ODRP, Ontario is now the principal source of quality glass cullet for Ontario glass manufacturing – previously Ontario glass manufacturers had to source glass cullet from other jurisdictions to support production. In 2013-2014, the Beer Store and ODRP program combined, avoided 196,332 tonnes of GHG emissions - equivalent to taking over 41,333 cars and trucks off Ontario roads.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energyresources/ calculator.html#results&lt;/ref&gt; Combined, these programs avoided over 2,694,461 gigajoules of energy - equivalent to over $41 million of oil (Note ($94.73/barrel and 6.1 GJ/barrel of oil).

Between 2013-2014, the Beer Store achieved a system-wide recovery and re-use rate of 99 per cent for the industry standard bottles, which are reused 12 to 15 times.&lt;ref name="thebeerstore.ca"/&gt; The Beer Store has received praise from local and national organizations including the [[Conservation Council of Ontario]], [[Environmental Defence Canada]], [[The Recycling Council of Ontario]], and [[Toronto Environmental Alliance]].&lt;ref name="officialenvqt"&gt;{{cite web
 | title = What Others are Saying

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TBS’ recycling efforts translate into cost savings for municipal governments as municipalities need not spend tax revenue on recycling packaging that TBS sells. In 2008, TBS estimated that its return program has saved taxpayers $38 million in avoided waste management and recycling program costs per year.&lt;ref name = "report2008" /&gt; In 2012, the TBS estimated that savings had increased to $40 million with 94% of beer containers and 81% of LCBO containers recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2013/06/28/the_average_beer_bottle_is_refilled_15_times_in_its_environmentallyfriendly_life_cycle.html |title=The average beer bottle is refilled 15 times in its environmentally-friendly life cycle |last=Teotonio |first=Isabel |date= Jun 28, 2013 |work=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beer Store also is actively engaged in reducing its [[carbon footprint]] by finding innovative ways to reduce its energy consumption, a key input for any retail organization, especially one with a need to constantly refrigerate its product.&lt;ref name="report2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/TBSopreport2008.pdf | title = 2008 Operational Report | publisher = The Beer Store | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101130170644/http://thebeerstore.ca/TBSopreport2008.pdf | archivedate = 2010-11-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable initiative is the use outside air to cool beer when outside temperatures provide for such a tactic.&lt;ref name="report2008" /&gt;

Pierre Sadik, Senior Policy Adviser at the [[David Suzuki Foundation]] has stated, "Ontarians should be proud of The Beer Store's environmental achievements. It's time businesses across the province follow The Beer Store's lead and turn their talk about waste diversion into real action."&lt;ref name="officialenvqt" /&gt;

===Corporate responsibility===

TBS maintains a strict policy of WeID 25 and the right to refuse any customer who appears intoxicated or who is underage. Furthermore, TBS empowers its retail management to actively monitor and track every employee’s refusal rate to ensure proper conformance to company policy.&lt;ref name="report2008" /&gt; In 2017, TBS employee challenge and refusal rates are the following:

RETAIL BEER CHALLENGES AND REFUSALS CY17 | Jan, 2017 – Dec, 2017

# Minors Challenged/asked to produce I.D:3,388,975 
# Minors Refused service: 31,983
# Intoxicants Challenged/suspected for being impaired (alcohol/drugs): 13,583
# Intoxicants Refused service for impairment: 10,390  
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us/social-responsibility
 | title = Social Responsibility
 | publisher = The Beer Store
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beer Store works closely with Police agencies across Ontario to report suspected impaired driving. Also Retail employees will work with the customer in finding other means of transportation(cab/transit/call a friend) home if suspected they are impaired and refused service, they go the extra step to make sure the customer will arrive alive and not just let them find a way home.

===Returns for Leukemia===
Since 2006 The Beer Store, UFCW Local 12R24 (the union representing its employees), and the [[Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society of Canada]] have partnered together to help raise awareness and funds for blood cancer research through the collection of empty bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| title=2014 Annual Report| url=https://www.lls.org/sites/default/files/National/USA/Pdf/LLS_AR_2014.pdf| format=PDF| p=17| publisher=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society| accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bottle drive is formally called "Returns for Leukemia" but many refer to it as the "Leukemia Bottle Drive". It is held on the last Saturday of May and is also the world's largest bottle drive.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Over the last 13 years, through donations of cash and empties, the event has raised over $15 million for the cause.

==Criticism==
{{original research|section|date=January 2014}}

===Brewer neutrality===
The Beer Store employees are not allowed to recommend one brand over another. Staff can tell customers about the products but cannot encourage customers to choose a specific brand. This policy is known as brewer neutrality.
The Beer Store is permitted to charge non-shareholding breweries listing fees, for each beer carried in stock, that many critics perceive as substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.realbeer.com/library/authors/hughey-r/distribution.php
 | title = 	Beer distribution in Canada
 | first = Robert | last = Hughey | publisher = Real Beer Media, Inc.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listing fees have been criticized as restricting competition in the huge Ontario beer market, especially from smaller brewers who often cannot afford the fees, especially for multiple brands.

Some Canadian provinces have since allowed privately owned stores to compete for sales of beer and wine while retaining tighter controls over the sale of spirits, while Alberta has privatized all retail liquor stores. In Ontario no changes have been made, and The Beer Store continues to sell over 80% of the beer sold in the province, and is the only entity legally allowed to sell 12-packs, 24-packs, and other large cases. The Beer Store has only limited competition for retail sales of 6-packs and singles with the government-owned LCBO, select supermarkets, and individual brewer retailers, located on-site at most Ontario breweries. Furthermore, the competition is only with respect to location, as prices between supermarkets, LCBO and TBS are kept uniform. Many critics say this constitutes a foreign-owned monopoly.{{Who|date=May 2018}}

With regards to distribution, TBS operates its own fleet and provides service to over 16,000 licensed establishments in Ontario. TBS also delivers beer to Beer Stores on behalf of brewers who may choose to avoid the high cost of self-distributing. Critics have stated that TBS does not provide any credit terms for licensed clients, forcing them to pay cash on delivery, causing friction between TBS and the hospitality industry.{{Who|date=May 2018}} However, TBS does provide credit terms and flexible payment options for customers. Customers may receive up to seven days of credit terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer prices===
Critics say TBS constitutes a foreign-owned [[monopoly]] over retail beer sales in Ontario, costing the consumer more in the long run in terms of convenience and price. Critics{{who|date=June 2014}} also state that if retail beer sales were opened up, then the average price to the consumer would drop due to competition within the marketplace. TBS has argued that the price of beer will increase if privatization occurs and points to the situations of BC and Alberta as prime examples. In an independent report titled “Alcohol Retailing Deregulation: Implications for Ontario” by economist Greg Flanagan, it was demonstrated that the general consequence of deregulating the sale of alcohol is an increase in average sale price. Since Alberta’s deregulation of alcohol in 1993, their retail alcohol prices have since tripled Ontario’s (28.2% vs 9.2%).&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Greg. (2014) "Alcohol Retailing Deregulation: Implications for Ontario."[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/pdfs/TBS_AlcoholDeregulation.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; By accounting for tax differentials and comparing the average (non-sale) 24 pack cost of beer between BC, Alberta, Quebec and Ontario, the report concludes stating that Ontarians are well served under the current regulated model.

===Political controversy===
The Beer Store has been subject to criticism following the [[Molson Coors Brewing Company|Molson-Coors]] merger, whose 49% stake in TBS was the last 100% Canadian-owned share of the venture under the pre-merger [[Molson]] Breweries. In 2005, Ontario's alcohol laws were reviewed and proposals to allow the sale of beer in grocery and convenience stores were put forth. A report called the Beverage Alcohol System Review was released on March 24, 2005 by the Ontario Government. However, the report’s findings dealt centrally with the LCBO and the economic and social impact of its privatization.

An online petition was started by a private citizen, Derek Forward, to ask the provincial government to end the monopoly enjoyed by the Beer Store. The petition has received coverage in the Toronto Star, and has generated enough support to allow it to be formally presented to the provincial legislature in the fall of 2008 for consideration (petition No. P–146: "Practice and arrangement of retailing beer"). However, on December 9, 2008, the Ontario government dismissed the petition citing the effectiveness of the TBS system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 2007 provincial election campaign, [[Brick Brewing Company|The Brick Brewing Company]] of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] made headlines when it claimed The Beer Store engaged in a number of discriminatory practices and policies, such as restrictions on price advertising, for causing a decline in company sales. TBS representatives denied that their policies are hurting small brewers and implicitly questioned the timing of the Brick Brewing Company's statement, suggesting that in their view it is unethical for a brewery to use an electoral campaign to forward self-interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | title = Brick seeks province's help as earnings go flat

 | date = 2007-09-12 | work = [[The Toronto Star]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Brick claimed  that TBS allegedly used monopolistic tactics to force what is now Ontario's largest independent brewer to stop offering beer in "Stubbies" by withholding supplies of industry standard "long-necked" bottles. The Beer Store claimed that Brick signed an agreement in 1992 to use the industry standard bottle and Brick said it never signed such an agreement. This dispute was settled out of court with the terms of the settlement undisclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | first = Dana | last = Flavelle
 | date = 2009-09-04 | work = The Toronto Star
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brick has since stopped selling beer in "stubbies" because the cost was too high.

A July 2008 Toronto Star article attributed an industry analyst as estimating the three foreign entities that owned TBS earned $1 billion in profit per year in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/454836 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Dana | last=Flavelle | title=Why your beer costs more | date=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontario Craft Brewers]] is the main lobby group for Ontario's smaller brewers, and has been increasingly critical of BRI/TBS. The 29 OCB members currently employ several thousand Ontarians. OCB wants to either acquire shares in TBS or be permitted to set up their own competing chain. Premier McGuinty responded by saying that his government would not consider any application to form a competing chain, and that his government would not consider compelling TBS shareholders to sell any shares, although some Liberal and Conservative backbenchers have said they would expect BRI to at least negotiate in good faith with craft brewers who made a serious offer. BRI responded by saying that it was not considering and would not consider selling shares at any price, and that they do more than enough to accommodate non-shareholding brewers already. Canada's National Brewers (the lobby group that represents the BRI shareholders) further said that in the event OCB did get to set up a competing chain, they would refuse to stock their products there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the website ''Canadian Beer News'' reported that The Beer Store has made thousands of dollars worth of political donations to the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] and [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]]. The report noted that it was odd for an Ontario-based company to be making such large donations to political parties in another province, and suggested that the co-owning breweries were funneling this money through The Beer Store in an attempt to put pressure on the BC government to give their brands favourable placements in [[Liquor Distribution Branch|BC Liquor]] stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Non-competitive business practices===

On December 9, 2014, [[Toronto Star]] investigative journalist Martin Regg Cohn exposed an agreement between The Beer Store and the [[LCBO]] to limit competition and the products offered to Ontario beer drinkers.&lt;ref name="sweetheart"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2014/12/09/the_beer_stores_secret_sweetheart_deal_with_lcbo_revealed_cohn.html|title=The Beer Store’s secret sweetheart deal with LCBO revealed|last=Regg Cohn|first=Martin|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=9 December 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/lcbo-beer-store-deal-limits-competition-in-beer-sales-report-1.2866076|title=LCBO, Beer Store deal limits competition in beer sales: report|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document of June 1, 2000, provided to him by a [[whistleblower]], entitled “Serving Ontario Beer Consumers — Framework for Improved Co-operation and Planning Between the LCBO and BRI", was signed by then head of the LCBO [[Andy Brandt]] and head of BRI Daver Perkins, of which a copy was sent to [[Ministry of Consumer Services (Ontario)|Ministry of Consumer &amp; Commercial Relations]] Deputy Minister Sandra Lang.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

The agreement ensured that the LCBO would not offer beer products in large format sizes, being cases of 12 or 24 beers, it would not sell major brands to restaurants or bars, and would inform the Beer Store of any store it was planning to open in a new community.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2014/12/09/the_beer_stores_secret_sweetheart_deal_with_lcbo_revealed_cohn.html|title=The Beer Store’s secret sweetheart deal with LCBO revealed: Cohn - Toronto Star|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/12/11/how_the_secret_deal_between_the_lcbo_and_beer_store_affects_the_booze_you_buy.html|title=How the secret deal between the LCBO and Beer Store affects the booze you buy - Toronto Star|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regg Cohn says both retail consumers and the food and beverage industry are being gouged by this non-competitive business agreement. Former [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|TD Bank]] CEO Ed Clark, in a 2014 report to the government on maximizing assets, says that the LCBO (and the Government of Ontario) forgoes $515 million of revenue by not allowing sales of larger format beer packages and forgoes $500 million of revenue by not selling major brands to restaurants.&lt;ref name="sweetheart" /&gt;

[[Andy Brandt]], former highly successful head of the LCBO, is very critical of the agreement, and says it was forced upon him by the then [[Mike Harris]] [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] government.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt; When Regg Cohn questioned the Beer Store representatives about the agreement, suggesting it is [[collusion]], the reply from the BRI lawyer Michael A. Eizenga of Bennett Jones LLP stated the "use of the term 'collusion' which has significant legal meaning," and "This is an inaccurate and inappropriate characterization, to which my client objects."&lt;ref name="bitter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2014/12/10/bitter_fallout_from_the_beer_stores_sweetheart_deal_cohn.html|title=Bitter fallout from The Beer Store’s sweetheart deal|last=Regg Cohn|first=Martin|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal Finance Minister [[Charles Sousa]], in response to these revelations, says he has "got the investigation underway" and that "I'm trying to ensure that what you’re suggesting doesn’t happen any further ... You're right, there's a monopoly, a duopoly, oligopoly — call it what you will."&lt;ref name="bitter" /&gt;

On December 10, 2014, [[Restaurants Canada]] filed an official complaint with the [[Competition Bureau]]. "'We did not know the depth of the complicity,' it said, pointing to 'new and disturbing information' in the Star that detailed price gouging of restaurants and bars forced to buy from The Beer Store ... A Competition Bureau spokesperson said it is 'reviewing it to determine whether the conduct in question could raise concerns under the criminal or civil provisions in the Competition Act.'"&lt;ref name="bitter" /&gt;

On April 15, 2015, [[Premier of Ontario]] [[Kathleen Wynne]] announced changes to provincial liquor laws that would, among other changes, allow up to 450 supermarkets in "urban population centres" (roughly equating the number of Beer Store locations) to be authorized to sell beer subject to conditions, require The Beer Store to improve the placement and marketing of Ontario craft brews, and allow LCBO locations to trial carrying 12-packs. Wynne stated that The Beer Store had become a "de-facto monopoly controlled by a small number of companies".&lt;ref name=cbc-grocerybeer&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontario to sell off 60% of Hydro One, allow beer in grocery stores|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-to-sell-off-60-of-hydro-one-allow-beer-in-grocery-stores-1.3035347|website=CBC News|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new regulations took effect on December 15, 2015 with 58 designated supermarkets, and additional locations to be added in the future; all products must be below 7.1% alcohol by volume, and at least 20% of a store's stock must be Ontario craft brews. [[Loblaw Companies]] elected to go beyond the minimum quota and committed to stock 50% Ontario craft brews at its participating stores, in an effort to provide a wider array of options.&lt;ref name=torstar-beerfinallyarrives&gt;{{cite web|title=Beer finally arrives in Ontario grocery stores|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/12/15/beer-arrives-in-ontario-grocery-stores.html|website=Toronto Star|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the sale of beer in supermarkets has increased availability to consumers, it has done nothing to increase competition or lower prices for consumers. Beer prices in supermarkets are dictated by the LCBO, to the point that the LCBO, and not the supermarket, inputs beer prices into store computer check-out systems. Those prices are kept in line with LCBO and TBS prices. Depending on and accounting for the exchange rate at time of purchase, it can cost 25-40% less to buy a 24 pack of Ontario brewed beer at a New York State supermarket than it will cost anywhere in Ontario. It should be noted that current Ontario beer commodity taxes are currently a $11.30 per case compared to New York’s beer excise tax of $0.41 per case.&lt;ref&gt;As of March 2018 under the Alcohol Gaming Regulation and Public Protection Act, Ontario collects a basic beer tax of $0.8974 per litre, a volume levy of $0.176 per litre and an environmental levy of $0.0893 per non-refillable containers which equate to $11.30 per 24-cans.  New York’s 2018 state excise tax for beer is $0.14 per gallon which equates to $0.41 per case $Cdn dollars on a 24-pack of cans (assuming a U.S. conversion rate of $1.2861 (12 month average as of March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;  Federal beer excise tax and sales taxes are also higher in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://axethebeertax.ca/beertax/pdf/beercanada-report-en.pdf|title=Beer Taxes: A Canadian US Comparison: A Report for Beer Canada|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{or?|date=April 2018}}

==As map publisher==
In the 1980s, Brewers Retail published a directory of its retail locations in a booklet with a small map to each location. It had a picture of an animal, (a penguin, for example) on the covers. The booklet when closed was approximately {{convert|4|x|3|in|cm}}. The 1972 version issued by Brewers Retail had cartography by [[Rand McNally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==In popular culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
In the film ''[[Strange Brew]]'' the [[McKenzie Brothers]] visit a Brewers Retail store demanding a refund after they attempt to return a bottle of beer that contained a mouse (the mouse was however placed in the bottle by the brothers). Due to the nature of the scene, Brewers Retail refused to allow the use of one of their actual stores for the filming, and also refused to allow the use of the name "Brewers Retail". In response, the filmmakers built their own replica store, and called it "The Beer Store". Coincidentally, several years later, Brewers Retail changed the name of its stores to "The Beer Store", and they continue to operate under this name.

The Beer Store was also showcased in episodes of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' during O'Brien's week-long tenure in Toronto during the week of February 10, 2004.

==Related companies==

[[Brewers' Distributor Ltd.]] (BDL) operates in [[Western Canada]] and is owned by [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] and Molson-Coors (Sleeman has its own distribution operation in the West). Unlike BRI, BDL only warehouses and distributes beer and is not in the retail business.

*The term may have been coined by nineteenth century New York City Police detective [[Thomas F.

*The [[Knights of Columbus]] have a third degree ceremony which is required to advance to that level, seen as rigorous.
*The progressive degrees of torture used to extract confessions during the Spanish Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;The degrees of torture used by the Spanish Inquisition have been described by Julius Glarus in the following terms: "Know therefore that there are five degrees of torture, viz: First, the being threatened to be tortured. Secondly, being carried to the place of torture. Thirdly, by stripping and binding. Fourthly, the being hoisted up on the rack. Fifthly, squassation." From these degrees of torture we get the famous third degree over which there has been so much controversy in the Press recently.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;John Swain, ''The Pleasures of the Torture Chamber'', 1931&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The "third degree" method of torturing a prisoner or suspect into confessing or answering questions or giving information is based on the method used by the Spanish Inquisition and is, generally, a war of nerves on the victim, followed many times by brute force at the end of a truncheon, by deliberate starvation, a deprivation of drink, exercise, sleep and amenities to perform the natural functions.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Edwin J. Henri, ''Methods of Torture and Execution'', 1966&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*The great difficulty of solving [[Cubic function#Derivation of the roots|third-degree polynomial equations]] by comparison with those of [[Quadratic equation|second degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=L'intuizione al potere  |series=Logica Matematica |date=c. 2000 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXPMd19PMco&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=13m |network=Nettuno ([[RAI]]) |number=14 |last=[[Piergiorgio Odifreddi|Odifreddi]] |first=[[Piergiorgio Odifreddi|Piergiorgio]]}} Translation of relevant passage (13:03-13:22): "The next problem, however, equations of third degree, is a very complicated problem. And in fact, even today people say 'he's giving me the third degree', or when you go to the police station and get arrested, the police give you the 'third degree'. So why this expression about the 'third degree'? Well the 'third degree' derives from right here, from the fact that the third-degree equation was very difficult to solve.'&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
On December 17, 2012, the United States of America filed a lawsuit in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon]] under the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]], {{usc|42|14141}} against the City of Portland, alleging improper use-of-force by the [[Portland Police Bureau]] against members of a protected class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Department of Justice v. City of Portland - Complaint, 9/13/2012 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_Department_of_Justice_v_City_of_Portland_-_Complaint.pdf |publisher=Department of Justice |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon and the [[Civil Rights Division]] of the U.S. Department of Justice, sought injunctive and declaratory relief. Based on findings of more than a year of investigation, the complaint alleged Portland police officers engaged in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional use of force against individuals with actual or perceived mental illness. Specifically, the DOJ claimed: (1) Portland police encounters with such individuals too frequently resulted in a higher level force than necessary; (2) Portland police employed [[Tasers]] more times than necessary on such individuals, or in circumstances where such force was not justified; and (3) Portland police used a higher degree of force than justified for low level offenses.

'''''U.S. v. City of Portland''''' is notable because of its finding persons with mental illness are primary recipients of police use-of-force.

In a widely publicized press conference June 8, 2011, Assistant U.S. Attorney General [[Thomas E. Perez]] announced the launch of an investigation to determine whether the Portland Police Bureau engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive or unnecessary use-of-force in their interactions with persons in a protected class, people with actual or perceived mental health disabilities, and whether such conduct deprived individuals of their rights secured by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Justice Department launches civil rights review of Portland police |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/06/us_justice_department_launches.html |publisher=The Oregonian |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18-month-long investigation was prompted by the high number of Portland police officer-involved deaths that involved individuals with mental illness, including Kendra James, James Jahar Perez, [[James Chasse]], Raymond Gwerder, Keaton Otis, Jack Dale Collins, Aaron Campbell, Darryel Ferguson, Thomas Higginbotham, and Brad Morgan.

On September 13, 2012, DOJ issued a Findings Letter with the results of the investigation, stating investigators found reasonable cause to believe Portland police had engaged in unconstitutional conduct. The letter identified serious deficiencies in policy, training, and officer accountability measures that substantially contributed to the unconstitutional conduct by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Department of Justice - Findings Letter from investigation of Portland Police Bureau, 9/13/2012 |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/USDOJ_Findings_Letter_re_Investigation_of_PPB_09_13_2012.pdf |publisher=Department of Justice |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, DOJ and the City of Portland released a joint statement declaring the parties' mutual intent to reach a negotiated settlement agreement to resolve these issues.

On October 13, 2012, in a joint press conference, the DOJ and the City of Portland announced a settlement had been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portland mayor, chief, and Oregon U.S. Attorney announce settlement on Portland police reforms  |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/10/portland_mayor_chief_and_orego.html  |publisher=Oregonian |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 2012, Portland City Council unanimously approved the settlement agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council Unanimously Approves Police Union Contract, Federal Reform Deal |url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2013/12/18/council-unanimously-approves-police-union-contract-federal-reform-deal |publisher=Portland Mercury |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 27, 2012 Portland City Council approved a new tax on service providers of telephone land-lines to pay for police reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portland City Council approves tax for land-line phone service providers  |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/11/portland_city_council_approves_15.html |publisher=Oregonian |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, 2012 — the same date the complaint was filed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Department of Justice v. City of Portland - Complaint, 9/13/2012 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_Department_of_Justice_v_City_of_Portland_-_Complaint.pdf |publisher=Department of Justice |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; —the parties filed a joint motion to enter a settlement agreement and conditionally dismiss the action, subject to the Court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''U.S. v. City of Portland'', Joint Settlement Agreement |url=http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-OR-0001-0004.pdf  |publisher=Department of Justice |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed settlement agreement includes detailed provisions addressing Portland Police Bureau policies and practices regarding: (1) use of force; (2) dealing with persons perceived as or actually suffering from mental illness or mental health crises; (3) dealing with persons suffering from addictions and mental health challenges; (4) crisis intervention; (5) identifying at-risk employees; (6) officer accountability; (7) training; (8) supervision; (9) misconduct complaint intake, investigation, and adjudication; (10) transparency and oversight; and (11) community engagement. The proposed settlement agreement also includes provisions regarding the implementation and enforcement of its terms.

On December 18, 2012, the Portland Police Association, a labor union representing officers of the Portland Police Bureau, filed a motion to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum in support of intervener-defendant Portland Police Association's Motion to Intervene |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Plaintiff_AMA_Coalition%27s_Motion_to_Intervene.pdf |publisher=Department of Justice |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 8, 2013, the Albina Ministerial Alliance Coalition for Justice and Police Reform also moved to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plaintiff AMA Coalition's Motion to Intervene |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plaintiff_AMA_Coalition%27s_Motion_to_Intervene.pdf |publisher=Department of Justice |accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both interveners asked to participate in any negotiations of the proposed settlement agreement. On February 19, 2013, the Judge [[Michael H. Simon]] fully granted the Portland Police Association's motion, and granted the Albina Ministerial Alliance Coalition for Justice and Police Reform "enhanced amicus status for remedy purposes." Ultimately, both parties were allowed to participate in the settlement negotiations.

== Outcome ==

The settlement agreement includes 187 items. One item is the defendant (The City of Portland) must hire a compliance officer-community liaison (COCL) and form a Community Oversight Advisory Board (COAB). After soliciting only three eligible applicants for the $315,000 per year position, on November 8, 2014 Portland City Council selected a team of academics led by Dennis Rosenbaum of the University of Illinois at Chicago. During community meetings Rosenbaum's team received the lowest rating, but boosted their viability to Mayor [[Charlie Hales]] by agreeing to hire former Oregon state Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Paul De Muniz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portland Mayor Charlie Hales favors out-of-state team with Oregon ties to monitor police reforms |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2014/11/portland_mayor_charlie_hales_f.html |publisher=Oregonian |accessdate=2014-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A retired chief justice of the state Supreme Court lobbies for the insurance industry|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-20646-this_robe_for_hire.html|accessdate=November 28, 2014|newspaper=[[Willamette Week]]|date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Muniz resigned April 8 citing poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Oregon Chief Justice Paul DeMuniz withdraws from Portland team overseeing police reforms  |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/04/former_oregon_chief_justice_pa_1.html |publisher=Oregonlive.com|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All parties reached a tentative agreement regarding the terms of the proposed settlement in December 2013. Subsequently, the court held a fairness hearing for the general public for February 18–19, 2014. Parties filed their post-hearing memoranda on July 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Portland, federal Justice officials now await judge's decision on settlement agreement regarding police reforms |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2014/07/city_of_portland_federal_justi.html |publisher=Oregonian |accessdate=2014-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Michael Simon approved the agreement August 29, stating the city must give him annual updates on reforms for up to five years. City Council, led by Mayor [[Charlie Hales]] and Commissioner [[Amanda Fritz]], with support from the police union, appealed Simon's decision on October 22, 2014. After months of talks between city and federal officials, they reached an agreement that the sessions won't be called "evidentiary hearings" but instead "status conferences," and the appeal was withdrawn in August 2015.

In September 2015 the DOJ released its first Compliance Status Assessment Report for the Settlement Agreement in ''United States v.

In August 2017 Portland City Council agreed to amend the Settlement Agreement to create a new community oversight group, the Portland Committee on Community Engaged Policing, bypass the Police Review Board when an officer accepts discipline for less-serious offenses, remove a 180-day deadline for an appeal ruling on alleged police misconduct before the Citizen Review Committee, ensure officers who use deadly force are interviewed within 48 hours, change to how use of force data is measured and collected, and allow the COCL to report on one or two comprehensive elements of the settlement instead of addressing every single element.

The '''White Paper of 1939'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;Occasionally also known as the '''MacDonald White Paper''' (e.g. Caplan, 2015, p.117) after [[Malcolm MacDonald]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] who presided over its creation.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[White paper|policy paper]] issued by the [[British government]] under [[Neville Chamberlain]] in response to the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–39 Arab Revolt]]. Following its formal approval in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 23 May 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/22/palestine-1 HC Deb 22 May 1939 vol 347 cc1937-2056] and [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/23/palestine HC Deb 23 May 1939 vol 347 cc2129-97]; "Resolved, That this House approves the policy of His Majesty's Government relating to Palestine as set out in Command Paper No. 6019."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;by 268 votes to 179.&lt;/ref&gt; it acted as the governing policy for [[Mandatory Palestine]] from 1939 until the British departure in 1948, the matter of the Mandate meanwhile [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|having been referred to the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/feb/18/palestine-conference-government-policy HC Deb 18 February 1947 vol 433 cc985-94]: "We have, therefore, reached the conclusion that the only course now open to us is to submit the problem to the judgment of the United Nations ... &lt;br&gt;[[Barnett Janner, Baron Janner|Mr. Janner]] Pending the remitting of this question to the United Nations, are we to understand that the Mandate stands. and that we shall deal with the situation of immigration and land restrictions on the basis of the terms of the Mandate, and that the White Paper of 1939 will be abolished? ... &lt;br&gt;[[Ernest Bevin|Mr. Bevin]] No, Sir. We have not found a substitute yet for that White Paper, and up to the moment, whether it is right or wrong, the House is committed to it. That is the legal position. We did, by arrangement and agreement, extend the period of immigration which would have terminated in December, 1945. Whether there will be any further change, my right hon. Friend the Colonial Secretary, who, of course, is responsible for the administration of the policy, will be considering later."&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy, first drafted in March 1939, was prepared by the British government unilaterally as a result of the failure of the Arab-Zionist [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]].{{sfn|Caplan|2015|p=114|ps=: "As it had been made clear from the start, the absence of agreement at the St James's Conference meant that the British were left, after March 17th 1939, to finalise and to enforce their new Palestine policy unilaterally. A White Paper, first drafted in late March, was not published until early May, thus affording Arabs and Jews further opportunities to continue their efforts at influencing the final terms of the proposed British policy."}} The paper called for the establishment of a Jewish national home in an independent Palestinian state within 10 years, rejecting the [[Peel Commission|idea of partitioning]] [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].  It also limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 for 5 years, and ruled that further immigration was to be determined by the Arab majority (section II).  Restrictions were put on the rights of Jews to buy land from Arabs (section III).

The proposal did not meet the political demands proposed by Arab representatives during the [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]] and was officially rejected by the representatives of Palestine Arab parties acting under the influence of [[Haj Amin Husseini|Haj Amin Eff el Husseini]] while more moderate Arab opinion represented in the National Defence Party was prepared to accept the White Paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Official Records of the Second Session of the General Assembly|title=United Nations Special Committee on Palestine 1947| publisher=United Nations|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/07175DE9FA2DE563852568D3006E10F3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zionist groups in Palestine immediately rejected the White Paper. There was a campaign of attacks on government property, which lasted for several months. On 18 May a Jewish general strike was called.&lt;ref name="Inquiry. p.54"&gt;''A Survey of Palestine - prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry.'' Reprinted 1991 by The Institute of Palestine Studies, Washington. Volumes One: {{ISBN|0-88728-211-3}}. p.54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations governing land transfers and clauses relating to immigration were implemented although at the end of the five-year period in 1944, only 51,000 of the 75,000 immigration certificates provided for had been utilized. In circumstances where Jewish refugees from Europe were fleeing violence and persecution, the White Paper's limits were relaxed and legal immigration was permitted to continue indefinitely at the rate of 18,000 a year.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;Study (30 June 1978): [https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/AEAC80E740C782E4852561150071FDB0 The Origins and Evolution of the Palestine Problem Part I: 1917-1947 - Study (30 June 1978)], accessdate: November 10, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Key provisions were ultimately never to be implemented, initially because of cabinet opposition following the change in government, and later because of preoccupation with World War II.{{sfn|Khalaf|1991|p=66|ps=: "The White Paper was never to be implemented, initially because of Cabinet opposition and then because of preoccupation with the war effort. However, 1939 and the first two years of the war saw a quiet, low key dialogue between the government and Palestinians who were ready to accept the White Paper. But the government's intention was to keep the Arabs placated, encourage the moderates, and continue to talk but promise very little, particularly on the constitutional provisions contained in the White Paper."}}

During [[World War I]], the British had made two promises regarding territory in the [[Middle East]]. Britain had promised the [[Hashemite]] governors of [[Arabia]], through [[T. E. Lawrence|Lawrence of Arabia]] and the [[Hussein-McMahon Correspondence]], independence for a united Arab country covering [[Syria]] in exchange for their supporting the British against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottoman Caliphate had declared a military [[jihad]] in support of the Germans and it was hoped that an alliance with the Arabs would quell the chances of a general Muslim uprising in British-held territories in Africa, India, and the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n706ShSYt-sC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=&amp;ei=VaM7SeidLKPCM-2J5L8D&amp;client=#PPA54,M1 King Husain and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press, 1979], {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain had also negotiated the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], agreeing to partition the Middle East between Britain and [[France]].

A variety of strategic factors, such as securing Jewish support in Eastern Europe as the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]] collapsed, culminated in the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917]], with Britain promising to create and foster a Jewish national home in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. These broad delineations of territory and goals for both the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and Arab self-determination was approved in the [[San Remo conference]].

In June 1922 the [[League of Nations]] approved the Palestine Mandate with effect from September 1923. The Palestine Mandate was an explicit document regarding Britain's responsibilities and powers of administration in Palestine including 'secur[ing] the establishment of the Jewish national home', and 'safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine'. In September 1922, the British government [[Transjordan memorandum|presented a memorandum]] to the League of Nations stating that [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] would be excluded from all the provisions dealing with Jewish settlement, in accordance with Article 25 of the Mandate, and this memorandum was approved on 23 September. Due to stiff Arab opposition and pressure against Jewish immigration, Britain redefined Jewish immigration by restricting its flow according to the country's economic capacity to absorb the immigrants. In effect annual quotas were put in place as to how many Jews could immigrate, while Jews possessing a large sum of money (£500) were allowed to enter the country freely.

Following [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]], a growing number of European Jews were prepared to spend the money necessary to enter Palestine. The 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]] stripped the 500,000 German Jews of their citizenship. Jewish migration was impeded by Nazi restrictions on the transfer of finances abroad (departing Jews had to abandon their property), but the [[Jewish Agency]] was able to negotiate an agreement allowing Jews resident in Germany to buy German goods for export to Palestine thus circumventing the restrictions.

The large numbers of Jews entering Palestine{{Elucidate|reason=The reason for the Arab revolt were Economical, Political and Social. The mostly Jewish immigration from Europe aggravated those problems by bringing progress, but wasn't the sole reason for it|date=January 2014}} led to the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. Britain responded to the Arab revolt by appointing a [[Royal Commission]], known as the [[Peel Commission]] which traveled out to Palestine and undertook a thorough study of the issues. The Peel Commission recommended in 1937 that Palestine be partitioned into two states, one Arab the other Jewish. In January 1938, the [[Woodhead Commission]] explored the practicalities of partition. The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out).&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"&gt;{{cite web|title=Woodhead commission report |url=https://archive.org/details/WoodheadCommission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State.&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"/&gt; The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to "political, administrative and financial difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;Statement by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty November, 1938. {{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103061306/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed a substantially smaller Jewish state, including the coastal plain only. An [[Évian Conference|international conference]] (Évian Conference) convened by the United States in July 1938, failed to find any agreement to deal with the rapidly growing number of Jewish refugees.

===London Conference===
{{main|London Conference (1939)}}
In February 1939 the British called the [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]] to negotiate an agreement between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. The Arab delegates attended on condition that they would not meet directly with the Jewish representatives, which would constitute recognition of Jewish claims over Palestine. So the British government held separate meetings with the two sides. The conference ended in failure on March 17.&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angap04.asp Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry - Appendix IV] Palestine: Historical Background&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of World War II, the British believed that Jewish support was guaranteed or unimportant. However they feared that the Arab world might turn against them. This geopolitical consideration was, in [[Raul Hilberg]]'s word, "decisive"&lt;ref&gt;[[Raul Hilberg|Hilberg, Raul]], ''The Destruction of the European Jews'', (1961) New Viewpoints, New York 1973 p.716&lt;/ref&gt; to British policies. [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] were independent and allied with Britain.

==Content==
[[File:WhitePaper.jpg|thumb|Land classification and boundaries of land transfer regions as prescribed in 1940.]]
The main points of the White Paper were:
*'''Section I. The Constitution''': It stated that with over 450,000 Jews having now settled in the mandate, the Balfour Declaration about "a national home for the Jewish people" had been met and called for an independent Palestine established within 10 years, governed jointly by Arabs and Jews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His Majesty's Government believe that the framers of the Mandate in which the Balfour Declaration was embodied could not have intended that Palestine should be converted into a Jewish State against the will of the Arab population of the country. [ ... ] His Majesty's Government therefore now declare unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State. They would indeed regard it as contrary to their obligations to the Arabs under the Mandate, as well as to the assurances which have been given to the Arab people in the past, that the Arab population of Palestine should be made the subjects of a Jewish State against their will.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The objective of His Majesty's Government is the establishment within 10 years of an independent Palestine State in such treaty relations with the United Kingdom as will provide satisfactorily for the commercial and strategic requirements of both countries in the future. [..] The independent State should be one in which Arabs and Jews share government in such a way as to ensure that the essential interests of each community are safeguarded.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*'''Section II. Immigration''': Jewish immigration to Palestine under the British Mandate was to be limited to 75,000 over the next five years, after which it would depend on Arab consent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;His Majesty's Government do not [..] find anything in the Mandate or in subsequent Statements of Policy to support the view that the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine cannot be effected unless immigration is allowed to continue indefinitely. If immigration has an adverse effect on the economic position in the country, it should clearly be restricted; and equally, if it has a seriously damaging effect on the political position in the country, that is a factor that should not be ignored. Although it is not difficult to contend that the large number of Jewish immigrants who have been admitted so far have been absorbed economically, the fear of the Arabs that this influx will continue indefinitely until the Jewish population is in a position to dominate them has produced consequences which are extremely grave for Jews and Arabs alike and for the peace and prosperity of Palestine. The lamentable disturbances of the past three years are only the latest and most sustained manifestation of this intense Arab apprehension [ ... ] it cannot be denied that fear of indefinite Jewish immigration is widespread amongst the Arab population and that this fear has made possible disturbances which have given a serious setback to economic progress, depleted the Palestine exchequer, rendered life and property insecure, and produced a bitterness between the Arab and Jewish populations which is deplorable between citizens of the same country. If in these circumstances immigration is continued up to the economic absorptive capacity of the country, regardless of all other considerations, a fatal enmity between the two peoples will be perpetuated, and the situation in Palestine may become a permanent source of friction amongst all peoples in the Near and Middle East.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jewish immigration during the next five years will be at a rate which, if economic absorptive capacity permits, will bring the Jewish population up to approximately one third of the total population of the country. Taking into account the expected natural increase of the Arab and Jewish populations, and the number of illegal Jewish immigrants now in the country, this would allow of the admission, as from the beginning of April this year, of some 75,000 immigrants over the next four years. These immigrants would, subject to the criterion of economic absorptive capacity, be admitted as follows: For each of the next five years a quota of 10,000 Jewish immigrants will be allowed on the understanding that a shortage one year may be added to the quotas for subsequent years, within the five-year period, if economic absorptive capacity permits. In addition, as a contribution towards the solution of the Jewish refugee problem, 25,000 refugees will be admitted as soon as the [[High Commissioner]] is satisfied that adequate provision for their maintenance is ensured, special consideration being given to refugee children and dependents. The existing machinery for ascertaining economic absorptive capacity will be retained, and the High Commissioner will have the ultimate responsibility for deciding the limits of economic capacity. Before each periodic decision is taken, Jewish and Arab representatives will be consulted. After the period of five years, no further Jewish immigration will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*'''Section III. Land''': Previously no restriction had been imposed on the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews, while now the ''White Paper'' stated: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Reports of several expert Commissions have indicated that, owing to the natural growth of the Arab population and the steady sale in recent years of Arab land to Jews, there is now in certain areas no room for further transfers of Arab land, whilst in some other areas such transfers of land must be restricted if Arab cultivators are to maintain their existing standard of life and a considerable landless Arab population is not soon to be created. In these circumstances, the High Commissioner will be given general powers to prohibit and regulate transfers of land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Parliamentary Approval===
On 22 May 1939 the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] debated a motion that the White Paper was inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate. It was defeated by 268 votes to 179. The following day the [[House of Lords]] accepted the new policy without a vote.&lt;ref&gt;''A Survey of Palestine - prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry.'' Reprinted 1991 by The Institute of Palestine Studies, Washington. Volume one. {{ISBN|0-88728-211-3}}. p.54.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the debate, [[Lloyd George]] called the White Paper an "act of perfidy" while [[Winston Churchill]] voted against the government of his party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Manchester Guardian |title = The Broadcast Debate: "An Act of Perfidy" Mr. Lloyd George's Attack On Plan | date=24 May 1939 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[James Armand de Rothschild|James Rothschild]] stated during the parliamentary debate that "for the majority of the Jews who go to Palestine it is a question of migration or of physical extinction".&lt;ref&gt;[[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Debates, Volume 347 column 1984 [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/22/palestine-1#column_1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters of the Conservative {{Citation needed|reason=mistake. i.e. conservative|date=January 2014}} Government were opposed to the policy on the grounds that it appeared in their view to contradict the [[Balfour Declaration]]. Several government MPs either voted against the proposals or abstained, including Cabinet Ministers such as the illustrious Jewish [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]].&lt;ref name="Morris2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC&amp;pg=PA158|date=25 May 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78805-4|pages=158–159|quote=The White Paper was denounced as 'illegal,' as it contradicted the terms of the Mandate, [ ... ] In Britain, although the Conservatives had a comfortable majority in Parliament, the government was put on the defensive: Two cabinet ministers (Leslie Hore-Belisha and Walter Elliot) and 110 Conservative MPs abstained, and all of Labour's MPs voted against.

===League of Nations===
The supervising authority of the League of Nations, the [[Permanent Mandates Commission]] abstained unanimously from endorsing the White Paper,{{Citation needed|reason=mistake. Four out of seven rejected the paper, while the other three members have not supported it|date=January 2014}} though four out of seven members thought the new policy was inconsistent with that mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul, ''The Destruction of the European Jews,'' (1961) New Viewpoints, New York 1973 p.717 n.7&lt;/ref&gt; The League of Nations commission rejected the White Paper because it was in conflict with the terms of the Mandate as put forth in the past. The outbreak of the Second World War suspended any further deliberations.&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2011p159"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC|date=25 May 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78805-4|page=159|chapter=chp. 4|quote="Capping it all, the Permanent Mandates Commission of the Council of the League of Nations rejected the White Paper as inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab Reactions===
The [[Arab Higher Committee]] initially argued that the independence of a future Palestine Government would prove to be illusory, as the Jews could prevent its functioning by withholding participation, and in any case real authority would still be in the hands of British officials. The limitations on Jewish immigration were also held to be insufficient, as there was no guarantee immigration would not resume after five years. In place of the policy enunciated in the White Paper, the Arab Higher Committee called for "a complete and final prohibition" of Jewish immigration and a repudiation of the Jewish national home policy altogether.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In June 1939,{{sfn|Khalif|1991|p=283}} Hajj [[Amin al-Husayni]] initially "astonished" the other members of the Arab Higher Committee by turning down the White Paper. Al-Husayni, according to [[Benny Morris]], turned the advantageous proposal down for the entirely selfish reason that "it did not place him at the helm of the future Palestinian state."&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]], "The Tangled Truth", ''[[The New Republic]]'', May '07, '08 [https://newrepublic.com/article/books/the-tangled-truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1940, after two weeks of meetings with the British representative [[S. F. Newcombe]],{{sfn|Cohen|2014|p=367|ps=: "In July 1940, Colonel S.F. Newcombe. an Arabist who had served with T.E. Lawrence during World War One, made a Middle East tour sponsored by the British Council. His mission was to improve Arab public opinion about Britain. The government agreed that he should stop over in Baghdad to try unofficially, with the help of Nuri al-Said, to obtain the Mufti's endorsement of the While Paper. On his way Newcombe was briefed in Jerusalem by the High Commissioner. He was instructed to meet only with Nuri al-Said and with two prominent Palestinians. Jamal Husayni the Multi's cousin, and Musa Alami, but not with the Mufti himself. Newcombe stayed in Baghdad for 2 weeks."}} the leader of the Palestinian Arab delegates to the [[London Conference (1939)|London Conference]], [[Jamal al-Husseini]] and fellow delegate [[Musa al-Alami]], agreed to the terms of the White Paper and both signed a copy of it in the presence of the Prime Minister of Iraq, [[Nuri as-Said]].&lt;ref&gt;Buheiry, Marwan R. (1989) ''The Formation and Perception of the Modern Arab World. Studies by Marwan R Buheiry.'' Edited by Lawrence I. Conrad. Darwin Press, Princeton. {{ISBN|0-87850-064-2}}. p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zionist Reactions===
Zionist groups in Palestine immediately rejected the White Paper and began a campaign of attacks on government property and Arab civilians which lasted for several months. On 18 May a Jewish general strike was called.&lt;ref name="Inquiry. p.54"/&gt;

On 27 February 1939, in response to enthusiastic Arab demonstrations following reports that the British were proposing to allow Palestine independence on the same terms as Iraq, a coordinated [[Irgun]] bombing campaign across the country killed 38 Arabs and wounded 44.&lt;ref&gt;Kayyali, Abdul-Wahhab Said (no date) ''Palestine. A Modern History'' Croom Helm. {{ISBN|086199-007-2}}. p.221.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the White Paper, the right-wing Zionist militant group [[Irgun]] began formulating plans for a rebellion to evict the British and establish an independent Jewish state. [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], the founder of Irgun, who had been exiled from Palestine by the British, proposed a plan for a revolt to take place in October 1939, which he sent to the Irgun High Command in six coded letters. Under Jabotinsky's plan, he, together with other "illegals", would arrive in Palestine by boat, and the Irgun would help him and other passengers escape. Next, the Irgun would raid and occupy Government House, as well as other British centers of power in Palestine, raise the Jewish national flag, and hold them for at least 24 hours even at a heavy cost. Simultaneously, Zionist leaders in Western Europe and the United States would proclaim an independent Jewish state in Palestine, and would function as a government-in-exile. Irgun seriously considered carrying out the plan, but was concerned over the heavy losses it would doubtless incur. Irgun leader [[Avraham Stern]] (who would later break from Irgun to form [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]), formed a plan for 40,000 armed Jewish fighters recruited in Europe to sail to Palestine and join the rebellion. The Polish government supported his plan, and began training Jews and setting aside weaponry for them. However, the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 quickly put an end to these plans.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan: ''Free Jerusalem: Heroes, Heroines and Rogues who Created the State of Israel''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penkower, Monty Noam: Decision on Palestine Deferred: America, Britain and Wartime Diplomacy, 1939-1945&lt;/ref&gt;

After the outbreak of war in September 1939, the head of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency for Palestine]] [[David Ben-Gurion]] declared: 'We will fight the White Paper as if there is no war, and fight the war as if there is no White Paper.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Jewish Brigade|The Brigade]] by Howard Blum, p.5. In 1946, a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] song published in the ''[[Yishuv]]'' by Jacob Jacobs ad Isadore Lilian included these lyrics: ''Tserisn muz vern dos vayse papir, In der fremd viln mir mer nit zayn. Habeyt mishomyim ureey, Groyser got kuk arop un ze, Vi men yogt undz, vi men plot undz, Got, her oys undzer geshrey.'' "They don't care about Jewish anguish, The [[White Paper]] must be torn, We don't want to be away from our home anymore." (As described in "Palestine in Song," ''YIVO News'' No. 204, Winter 2008, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==
On 13 July the authorities announced the suspension of all Jewish immigration into Palestine until March 1940. The reason given for this decision was the increase in illegal immigrants arriving.&lt;ref&gt;''Survey''. p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1940, the British High Commissioner for Palestine issued an edict dividing Palestine into three zones. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Zone A, consisting of about 63 percent of the country including the stony hills, land transfers save to a Palestinian Arab were in general forbidden. In Zone B. consisting of about 32 percent of the country, transfers from a Palestinian Arab save to another Palestinian Arab were severely restricted at the discretion of the High Commissioner. In the remainder of Palestine, consisting of about five percent of the country-which, however, includes the most fertile areas - land sales remained unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]] - Appendix IV
 copy at [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angap04.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 1942, when extermination of the Jews became public knowledge, there were 34,000 immigration certificates remaining.  In February 1943, the British government announced that the remaining certificates could be used as soon as practicable to rescue Jewish children from southeastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria.  This plan was partly successful but many people who received certificates were not able to emigrate (but those in Bulgaria survived).&lt;ref name="ofer"&gt;Ofer, Dalia, ''Escaping the Holocaust'' (1990) pages 218ff, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; In July it was announced that any Jewish refugee who reached a neutral country in transit would be given clearance for Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Ofer, Dalia, ''Escaping the Holocaust'' (1990) page 219&lt;/ref&gt; During 1943 about half the remaining certificates were distributed,&lt;ref&gt;Ofer, Dalia, ''Escaping the Holocaust'' (1990) page 290&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the war there were 3,000 certificates left.&lt;ref&gt;Ovendale, R, "The Palestine Policy of the British Labour Government 1945-1946", ''International Affairs'', Vol. 55, pages 409-431.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of World War II, the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] conference voted to rescind the White Paper and establish a Jewish state in Palestine, however the Labour Foreign Minister, [[Ernest Bevin]] persisted with the policy and it remained in effect until the British departed Palestine in May 1948.

After the war, the determination of [[After the Holocaust|Holocaust survivors]] to reach Palestine led to large scale [[Aliyah Bet|illegal Jewish migration]] to Palestine. British efforts to block the migration led to violent resistance by the Zionist underground.

Illegal immigrants detained by the British Government were interned in [[Jews in British camps on Cyprus|camps on Cyprus]]. The immigrants had no citizenship and could not be returned to any country. Those interned included a large number of children and orphans.

From October 1946, the British Government, under the 'severest pressure' from the USA, relented and allowed 1,500 Jewish migrants a month into Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul ''The Destruction of the European Jews'', (1971) New Viewpoints ed. New York, 1973 p.729&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture was in deference to the recommendations of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Anglo-American Committee'' (1946) Cmd.6808 pp.65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Half of those admitted came from the [[Cyprus internment camps|prison camps for illegal immigrants in Cyprus]] due to fears that a growing Jewish presence in Cyprus would lead to an uprising there.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]]'' 11/08/46{{clarify|date=March 2013}} pg 35, UK Foreign Office document 371/52651&lt;/ref&gt;

The Provisional Council of Israel's first constitutional act was a Proclamation that "All legislation resulting from the British Government's White Paper of May, 1939, will at midnight tonight become null and void. This includes the immigration provisions as well as the land transfer regulations of February, 1940."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proclamation by Head of Government, Sunday May 16, 1948 |url= http://info.jpost.com/1998/Supplements/1948/features.html |work=''The Palestine Post'' Internet Edition |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
