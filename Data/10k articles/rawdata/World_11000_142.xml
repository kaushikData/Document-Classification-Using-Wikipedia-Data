      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3543">The '''Association of African Tax Institutes''' (AATI) is an industry association whose aim is, among other things, to provide a platform of collaboration between tax professionals in Africa and to help  bridge the divide between tax professionals in the countries of member bodies, their governments and taxpayers.

==Formation==

The establishment of a Pan-African association for tax institutes was initiated and spearheaded by Stiaan Klue, the Chief Executive of the [[SA Institute of Tax Practitioners]] (SAIT).&lt;ref name=Nweze20110629/&gt;

The AATI was launched during a meeting of Presidents of Taxation Institutes and Heads of Revenue Agencies in Africa in Lagos in June 2011. Countries represented at the founding of AATI included South Africa, Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, The Gambia, Côte d'Ivoire, Libya and Kenya. Sunday Jegede, president of the [[Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria]] (CITN) was elected inaugural President.&lt;ref name=PDaily20110622/&gt;
Two vice-presidents were elected, one from Ghana and one from South Africa.
Representatives from Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire are respectively Honorary Treasurer and Secretary.&lt;ref name=Nweze20110629/&gt;

Sunday Jegede said the AATI would help bridge the gap between the tax system and professionals in member countries, and would encourage all African countries to establish professional bodies. These would ensure that tax practice would be conducted by skilled professionals, and would help `their governments formulate sound tax policies.&lt;ref name=PDaily20110622/&gt;
Jegede said the AATI would further economic collaboration, harmonisation and integration within the continent through the use of taxation. He described this as a veritable economic transformation tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The secretariat of the AATI will be in Ghana.

The '''''Bolor Erike''''' (''The Crystal Beads''; [[Middle Mongolian]]: ''Bolor erikhe ᠪᠣᠯᠤᠷ ᠡᠷᠢᠬᠡ'', [[Mongolian language|Modern Mongolian]]: ''Bolor erikh'') is a [[Mongols|Mongolian]] chronicle written by Rashpuntsag in 1776.&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ApTfycfcJ1EC&amp;dq=rashpuntsag&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Christopher Kaplonski, (2004) Truth, History and Politics in Mongolia: Memory of Heroes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bolor"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2718593?uid=3738584&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104378810573 The Colophon to The Bolor Erike]&lt;/ref&gt;"Information Mongolia" calls the ''Bolor Erikh'' an important moment in Mongolian historiography. This history is said to have “made a successful attempt at critical assessment of the sources and appraisal of various historical events. Moreover, Rashpuntsag substantianed in his own way imperative need for ctiticism and dispute in recording history".&lt;ref name="academy"&gt;(Mongolian Academy of 
Sciences 1990:308)&lt;/ref&gt; Rashpunstag have suggested that [[Xiongnu]] were a [[proto-Mongols|Mongolic people]]. American Mongolist Dr.Christopher Atwood of [[Indiana University]], noted that Rashpuntsag "was the first Mongolian historian to be significantly influenced by 
Chinese historical writing and make use Chinese historical data (1998:330).

'''Communal elections''' were held in [[Burundi]] on 3 June and 7 June 2005. The elections were won by the [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy – Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] (CNDD-FDD), which won 1,781 of the 3,225 seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.content.eisa.org.za/sites/eisa.org.za/files/imports/import-data/WEP/bur2005local.htm Burundi: 2005 Communal election results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105101810/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/sites/eisa.org.za/files/imports/import-data/WEP/bur2005local.htm |date=2014-01-05 }} EISA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral system==
Each of the 129 [[Communes of Burundi|communes]] had 25 seats.

==Conduct==
The election was largely peaceful in most parts of the country, however, violence and intimidation in some communes of Bujumbura Rural and Bubanza provinces led to a re-poll held on 7 June. Observers considered the communal elections generally free and fair, despite some minor irregularities.

The '''City of London''' is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[counties of England|county]] that contains the historic centre and the primary [[central business district]] (CBD) of [[London]]. It constituted most of London from its [[Londinium|settlement]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the 1st century AD to the [[Middle Ages]], but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders.&lt;ref name="beckett"&gt;{{cite book |title=City status in the British Isles, 1830–2002 |series=Historical urban studies |author=Beckett, J V |year=2005 |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot |isbn=978-0-7546-5067-6 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of London Place Names|year=2010|last=Mills|first= AD|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=UWKcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 152] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |quote=Of course until relatively recent times the name London referred only to the City of London with even ''Westminster'' remaining a separate entity. But when the County of London was created in 1888, the name often came to be rather loosely used for this much larger area, which was also sometimes referred to as ''Greater London'' from about this date. However, in 1965 '''Greater London''' was newly defined as a much enlarged area. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The City is now only a tiny part of the [[Greater London Built-up Area|metropolis of London]], though it remains a notable part of [[central London]]. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 [[districts of England|local authority districts]] of [[Greater London]]; however, the City of London is not a [[London borough]], a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the [[City of Westminster]]). It is also a separate county of England, being an [[enclave]] surrounded by Greater London. It is the smallest county in the [[United Kingdom]].

The City of London is widely referred to simply as '''the City''' (differentiated from the phrase "the city of London" by capitalising ''City'') and is also colloquially known as the '''Square Mile''', as it is {{convert|1.12|sqmi|acre km2|2|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/nr/rdonlyres/10feeb0b-3ded-4c2d-93d1-8534fcb28cc5/0/Census%202001.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=10 April 2009 | title=City of London Resident Population Census 2001 | publisher=Corporation of London |date=July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in area. Both of these terms are also often used as [[Metonymy|metonyms]] for the United Kingdom's trading and [[financial services]] industries, which continue a notable history of being largely based in the City.&lt;ref name=Roberts2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Richard|title=The City: A Guide to London's Global Financial Centre|year=2008|publisher=Economist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0vl6CltQjEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20city%20richard%20roberts&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781861978585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-1716751/City-of-London-still-tops-finance-league.html |title=City of London still tops finance league |publisher=This is Money |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology of London|name ''London'']] is now ordinarily used for a far wider area than just the City. ''London'' most often denotes the sprawling London metropolis, or the 32 London boroughs, in addition to the City of London itself. This wider usage of ''London'' is documented as far back as 1888, when the [[County of London]] was created.&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt;

The [[local government in England|local authority]] for the City, namely the [[City of London Corporation]], is unique in the UK and has some unusual responsibilities for a local council, such as being the police authority. It is also unusual in having responsibilities and ownerships beyond its boundaries. The Corporation is headed by the [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor of the City of London]], an office separate from (and much older than) the [[Mayor of London]]. The current Lord Mayor, as of November 2018, is [[Peter Estlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/the-lord-mayor/Pages/working-with-mayor-of-london.aspx|title=Working with the Mayor of London – City of London|website=www.cityoflondon.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City is a major business and [[financial centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zyen.com/PDF/GFC%207.pdf#page=30 |title=Global Financial Centres 7 |publisher=[[Z/Yen]] |year=2010 |accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 19th century, the City was the world's primary business centre, and it continues to be a major meeting point for businesses.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunton|first=Larkin|title=The World and Its People|publisher=Silver, Burdett |year=1896|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; London came top in the [[Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index]], published in 2008. The insurance industry is focused around the eastern side of the City, around [[Lloyd's building]]. A secondary financial district exists outside the City, at [[Canary Wharf]], {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}} to the east.

The City has a resident population of 9,401 ([[Office of National Statistics|ONS]] estimate, mid-2016) but over 300,000 people commute to and work there. About three quarters of the jobs in the City of London are in the financial, professional, and associated business services sectors.&lt;ref name="citylondon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/Documents/city-statistics-briefing.pdf|title=City of London Jobs|publisher=The City of London|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal profession forms a major component of the northern and western sides of the City, especially in the [[Temple, London|Temple]] and [[Chancery Lane]] areas where the [[Inns of Court]] are located, of which two—[[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]]—fall within the City of London boundary.

== History ==
{{Main|History of London}}

=== Origins ===
{{Main|Roman London}}
[[File:Horned helmet.jpg|thumb|The [[Waterloo Helmet]], c. 150–50 BC, found in the [[River Thames]]]]
[[File:London Wall fragment.jpg|thumb|A surviving fragment of the [[London Wall]], built around 200 AD, close to [[Tower Hill]]]]

Known as "Londinium",  the Roman legions established on the current site of the City of London around {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;43. Its bridge over the [[River Thames]] turned the city into a [[#Roads|road nexus]] and major [[#Port|port]], serving as a major commercial centre in [[Roman Britain]] until its abandonment during [[#5th century|the 5th century]]. Archaeologist Leslie Wallace notes that "Because no [[Prehistoric Britain#Late pre-Roman Iron Age (LPRIA)|LPRIA]] settlements or significant domestic refuse have been found in London, despite extensive archaeological excavation, arguments for a purely Roman foundation of London are now common and uncontroversial."&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wallace|first1=Leslie|title=Late pre-Roman Iron Age (LPRIA)|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04757-0|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbMkBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=pre-roman+london#v=onepage&amp;q=pre-roman%20london&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height, the Roman city had a population of approximately 45,000–60,000 inhabitants. Londinium was an ethnically diverse city, with inhabitants from across the Roman Empire, including natives of Britannia, [[continental Europe]], the [[Middle East]], and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34809804 DNA study finds London was ethnically diverse from start], [[BBC]], 23 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans built the [[London Wall]] some time between 190 and 225 AD. The boundaries of the Roman city were similar to those of the City of London today, though Londinium did not extend further west than [[Ludgate]] or the [[River Fleet|Fleet]], and the mid-estuary Thames was undredged and wider than it is today thus, the City's shoreline was north of its present position. The Romans built a bridge across the river, as early as 50 AD, near to today's [[London Bridge]].

=== Decline ===
By the time the London Wall was constructed, the City's fortunes were in decline, and it faced problems of plague and fire. The Roman Empire entered a long period of [[Decline of the Roman Empire|instability and decline]], including the [[Carausian Revolt]] in Britain. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the city was under attack from [[Picts]], Scots, and [[Saxons|Saxon]] raiders. The decline continued, both for Londinium and the Empire, and in 410 AD the Romans withdrew entirely from Britain. Many of the Roman public buildings in Londinium by this time had fallen into decay and disuse, and gradually after the formal withdrawal the city became almost (if not, at times, entirely) uninhabited. The centre of trade and population moved away from the walled Londinium to [[Lundenwic]] ("London market"), a settlement to the west, roughly in the modern day [[Strand, London|Strand]]/[[Aldwych]]/[[Covent Garden]] area.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== Anglo-Saxon restoration ===

{{Main|Anglo-Saxon London}}
During the Anglo-Saxon [[Heptarchy]], the London area came in turn under the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Mercia]], and later [[Wessex]], though from the mid 8th century it was frequently under the control or threat of the [[Vikings]].
[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|left|thumb|Plaque near [[Southwark Bridge]] noting the activities around the time of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]].]]

[[Bede]] records that in 604 AD [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] consecrated [[Mellitus]] as the first bishop to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of the [[East Saxons]] and their king, [[Sæberht of Essex|Sæberht]]. Sæberht's uncle and overlord, [[Æthelberht of Kent|Æthelberht]], king of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], built a church dedicated to St Paul in London, as the seat of the new bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bede |authorlink=Bede |title=Ecclesiastical History of the English People |place=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon |year=1969 |editor-last=Colgrave |editor-first=Bertram |editor2-last=Mynors |editor2-first=R. A. B. |pages=142–3|title-link=Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed, although unproven, that this first Anglo-Saxon cathedral stood on the same site as the later medieval and the present cathedrals.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[Alfred the Great]], [[King of Wessex]] and arguably the first king of the "English", occupied and began the resettlement of the old [[Roman Empire|Roman]] walled area, in 886, and appointed his son-in-law [[Earl Aethelred of Mercia|Earl Æthelred of Mercia]] over it as part of their reconquest of the Viking occupied parts of England. The refortified Anglo-Saxon settlement was known as [[Lundenburh]] ("London Fort", a [[borough]]). The historian Asser said that "Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, restored the city of London splendidly&amp;nbsp;... and made it habitable once more."&lt;ref&gt;Asser's ''Life of King Alfred'', ch. 83, trans. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred &amp; Other Contemporary Sources'' (Penguin Classics) (1984), pp.&amp;nbsp;97–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred's "restoration" entailed reoccupying and refurbishing the nearly deserted Roman walled city, building quays along the Thames, and laying a new city street plan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Vince|Vince, Alan]], ''Saxon London: An Archaeological Investigation'', The Archaeology of London series (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred's taking of London and the rebuilding of the old Roman city was a turning point in history, not only as the permanent establishment of the City of London, but also as part of a unifying moment in early England, with Wessex becoming the dominant English kingdom and the repelling (to some degree) of the Viking occupation and raids. While London, and indeed England, were afterwards subjected to further periods of Viking and Danish raids and occupation, the establishment of the City of London and the [[Kingdom of England]] prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;''London: The Biography'', 2000, [[Peter Ackroyd]], p.&amp;nbsp;33–35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, [[Athelstan]] permitted eight [[royal mint|mints]] to be established, compared with six in his capital, [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]], indicating the wealth of the city. [[London Bridge]], which had fallen into ruin following the Roman evacuation and abandonment of Londinium, was rebuilt by the Saxons, but was periodically destroyed by Viking raids and storms.

As the focus of trade and population was moved back to within the old Roman walls, the older Saxon settlement of Lundenwic was largely abandoned and gained the name of ''Ealdwic'' (the "old settlement"). The name survives today as [[Aldwych]] (the "old market-place"), a name of a street and an area of the [[City of Westminster]] between [[Westminster]] and the City of London.

=== Medieval era ===

[[File:DeathWatTyler.jpg|thumb|right|A pivotal event during the [[Peasants' Revolt]], 1381: their leader [[Wat Tyler]] is stabbed by [[William Walworth]], Lord Mayor]]
{{See also|Norman and Medieval London}}
Following the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William the Conqueror]] marched on London ''(reaching as far as [[Southwark]])'', but failed to get across London Bridge or to defeat the Londoners. He eventually crossed the River Thames at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], pillaging the land as he went. Rather than continuing the war, [[Edgar the Ætheling]], [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]] and [[Morcar]] of Northumbria surrendered at [[Berkhamsted]]. William granted the citizens of London a charter in 1075; the City was one of a few examples of the English retaining some authority. The City was not covered by the [[Domesday Book]].

William built three castles nearby, to keep Londoners subdued:

* [[Tower of London]]
* [[Baynard's Castle]]
* [[Montfichet's Tower]]

About 1130, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] granted a [[Shrievalty of London|sheriff]] to the people of London, along with control of the county of [[Middlesex]]: this meant that the two entities were regarded as one administratively (not that the county was a dependency of the City) until the [[Local Government Act 1888]].&lt;ref name=vch_middlesex&gt;[[Victoria County History]]: A history of the County of Middlesex: Vol 2 pp&amp;nbsp;15–60 paragraph 12, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153]. Retrieved 2 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By 1141 the whole body of the citizenry was considered to constitute a single community. This 'commune' was the origin of the [[City of London Corporation]] and the citizens gained the right to appoint, with the king's consent, a Mayor in 1189—and to directly elect the Mayor from 1215.

From medieval times, the City has been composed of [[Wards of the City of London|25 ancient wards]], each headed by an [[Alderman]], who chairs [[Wardmote]]s, which still take place at least annually. A [[Folkmoot]], for the whole of the City held at the outdoor cross of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was formerly also held. Many of the medieval offices and traditions continue to the present day, demonstrating the unique nature of the City and its [[Corporation of London|Corporation]].

In 1381, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] affected London. The rebels took the City and the Tower of London, but the rebellion ended after its leader, Wat Tyler, was killed during a confrontation that included Lord Mayor [[William Walworth]].

[[File:Great fire of london map.png|thumb|right|Map showing the extent of the [[Great Fire of London]], which destroyed nearly 80% of the City]]
[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|right|The 1666 Great Fire as depicted in a 17th-century painting: it depicts Old London Bridge, churches, houses, and the Tower of London as seen from a boat near Tower Wharf]]

The City was burnt severely on a number of occasions, the worst being in 1123 and (more famously) in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Both of these fires were referred to as ''the'' Great Fire. After the fire of 1666, a number of plans were drawn up to remodel the City and its street pattern into a [[renaissance]]-style city with planned urban blocks, squares and boulevards. These plans were almost entirely not taken up, and the medieval street pattern re-emerged almost intact.

=== Early modern period ===
By the late 16th century, London increasingly became a major centre for banking, international trade and commerce. The [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] was founded in 1565 by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]] as a centre of commerce for London's merchants, and gained Royal patronage in 1571. Although no longer used for its original purpose, its location at the corner of [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] and [[Threadneedle Street]] continues to be the geographical centre of the City's core of banking and financial services, with the [[Bank of England]] moving to its present site in 1734, opposite the Royal Exchange on Threadneedle Street. Immediately to the south of Cornhill, [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]] was the location from 1691 of [[Lloyd's Coffee House]], which became the world-leading insurance market. London's insurance sector continues to be based in the area, particularly in [[Lime Street (ward)|Lime Street]].

In 1708, [[Christopher Wren]]'s masterpiece, [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was completed on his birthday. The first service had been held on 2 December 1697, more than 10 years earlier. It replaced the original St Paul's, which had been completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and is considered to be one of the finest cathedrals in Britain and a fine example of [[Baroque architecture]].

=== Growth of London ===

The 18th century was a period of rapid growth for London, reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and London's role at the centre of the evolving [[British Empire]]. The urban area expanded beyond the borders of the City of London, most notably during this period towards the [[West End of London|West End]] and [[Westminster]].

Expansion continued and became more rapid by the beginning of the 19th century, with London growing in all directions. To the [[East End of London|East]] the [[Port of London]] grew rapidly during the century, with the construction of many docks, needed as the Thames at the City could not cope with the volume of trade. The arrival of the railways and the [[London Underground|Tube]] meant that London could expand over a much greater area. By the mid-19th century, with London still rapidly expanding in population and area, the City had already become only a small part of the wider metropolis.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
An attempt was made in 1894 with the [[Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London]] to end the distinction between the City and the surrounding County of London, but a change of government at Westminster meant the option was not taken up. The City as a distinct [[polity]] survived despite its position within the London conurbation and [[History of local government in London|numerous local government reforms]]. Supporting this status, the City was a special [[parliamentary borough]] that elected four members to the [[unreformed House of Commons]], who were retained after the [[Reform Act 1832]]; reduced to two under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]; and ceased to be a separate constituency under the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]]. Since then the City is a minority (in terms of population and area) of the [[Cities of London and Westminster]].
[[File:St Pauls Cathedral in 1896.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Paul's Cathedral]], 1896.]]

The City's population fell rapidly in the 19th century and through most of the 20th century, as people moved outwards in all directions to London's vast [[Metro-land|suburbs]], and many residential buildings were demolished to make way for office blocks. Like many areas of London and other British cities, the City fell victim to large scale and highly destructive aerial bombing during [[World War II]], especially in [[the Blitz]]. Whilst St Paul's Cathedral survived the onslaught, large swathes of the area did not and the particularly heavy raids of late December 1940 led to a [[firestorm]] called the [[Second Great Fire of London]].

There was a major rebuilding programme in the decades following the war, in some parts (such as at the Barbican) dramatically altering the urban landscape. But the destruction of the older historic fabric allowed the construction of modern and larger-scale developments, whereas in those parts not so badly affected by bomb damage the City retains its older character of smaller buildings. The street pattern, which is still largely medieval, was altered slightly in places, although there is a more recent trend of reversing some of the post-war modernist changes made, such as at [[Paternoster Square]].

The City suffered terrorist attacks including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]]  ([[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]) and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] ([[Islamic terrorism|Islamist]]). In response to the 1993 bombing, a system of road barriers, checkpoints and surveillance cameras referred to as the "[[ring of steel (London)|ring of steel]]" has been maintained to control entry points to the City.

The 1970s saw the construction of tall office buildings including the 600-foot (183&amp;nbsp;m), 47-storey [[Natwest Tower]], the first skyscraper in the UK. Office space development has intensified especially in the central, northern and eastern parts, with skyscrapers including [[30 St Mary Axe|30 St. Mary Axe]] ("the Gherkin"'), [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] ("the Cheesegrater"), [[20 Fenchurch Street]] ("the Walkie-Talkie"), the [[Broadgate Tower]] and the [[Heron Tower]], the tallest in the City. Another skyscraper, [[22 Bishopsgate]], is under construction.

The main residential section of the City today is the [[Barbican Estate]], constructed between 1965 and 1976. The [[Museum of London]] is based there, as are a number of other services provided by the Corporation.

{{Contradicts other|date=August 2013|1=City of London Corporation}}
{{See also|City of London Corporation|History of local government in England#The City of London}}
The City has a unique political status, a legacy of its uninterrupted integrity as a corporate city since the [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon period]] and its singular relationship with the [[British monarchy|Crown]]. Historically its system of government was not unusual, but it was not reformed by the [[Municipal Reform Act 1835]] and little changed by later reforms.

It is administered by the [[City of London Corporation]], headed by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] (''not the same as the more recent [[Mayor of London]]''), which is responsible for a number of functions and has interests in land beyond the City's boundaries. Unlike other English local authorities, the Corporation has two council bodies: the (now largely ceremonial) [[Court of Aldermen]] and the [[Court of Common Council]]. The Court of Aldermen represents the wards, with each ward (irrespective of size) returning one Alderman. The chief executive of the Corporation holds the ancient office of [[Town Clerk of London]].

The City is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] which has a Commission of Lieutenancy headed by the Lord Mayor instead of a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] and has [[Sheriffs of the City of London|two Sheriffs]] instead of a [[High Sheriff]] (see [[list of Sheriffs of London]]), quasi-judicial offices appointed by the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]], an ancient political system based on the representation and [[Guild|protection of trades (Guilds)]]. Senior members of the Livery Companies are known as [[Liveryman|Liverymen]] and form the Common Hall, which chooses the Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs and certain other officers.

=== Wards ===
{{Main|Wards of the City of London}}
The City is made up of [[:Category:Wards of the City of London|25 wards]]. They are survivors of the medieval government system that allowed a very local area to exist as a self-governing unit within the wider city.&lt;ref&gt;''The City of London: A History''. Borer, Mary Irene Cathcart: New York, D. McKay Co., 1978 {{ISBN|0-09-461880-1}} p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be described as electoral/political divisions; ceremonial, geographic and administrative entities; sub-divisions of the City. Each ward has an [[Alderman]], who until the mid-1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/feb/13/schedule-1-the-london-boroughs#column_1364|date=13 February 1963 |column_start=278 |column_end=291}} [[Michael Stewart, Baron Stewart of Fulham|Michael Stewart]], ([[Labour Party (UK)|L]], [[Fulham (UK Parliament constituency)|Fulham]]&lt;/ref&gt; held office for life but since put themselves up for re-election at least every 6 years.

Each ward also has a Ward Club, which is similar to a [[residents' association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundaries.htm City of London Corporation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612211932/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundaries.htm |date=12 June 2011 }} Ward Boundaries, Beadles and Clubs&lt;/ref&gt;

The wards are ancient and their number has changed three times since [[time immemorial]]
*in 1394 [[Farringdon, London|Farringdon]] was divided into Farringdon Within and Farringdon Without
*in 1550 the ward of Bridge Without, [[Southwark|south of the river]], was created, the ward of Bridge becoming Bridge Within;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/gh/11ii.htm Guildhall Library Manuscripts Section] City of London wards&lt;/ref&gt;
*in 1978 these Bridge wards were merged as [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge]] ward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bridgewardclub.org.uk/ward%20of%20bridge.html Bridge Ward Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823044832/http://www.bridgewardclub.org.uk/ward%20of%20bridge.html |date=23 August 2007 }} History of the Bridge wards&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:City of London UK labelled ward map 2003.svg|thumb|A map of the wards since 2003]]

Following boundary changes in 1994, and later reform of the business vote in the City, there was a major boundary and electoral representation revision of the wards in 2003, and they were reviewed again in 2010 for change in 2013, though not to such a dramatic extent. The review was conducted by senior officers of the Corporation and senior judges of the [[Old Bailey]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundary_review.htm Corporation of London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114041508/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Council_and_democracy/Councillors_democracy_and_elections/ward_boundary_review.htm |date=14 January 2010 }} Ward Boundary Review (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; the wards are reviewed by this process to avoid [[malapportionment]]. The procedure of review is unique in the United Kingdom as it is not conducted by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] or a local government boundary commission every 8 to 12 years, which is the case for all other [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|wards in Great Britain]]. Particular churches, [[livery company]] halls and other historic buildings and structures are associated with a ward, such as St Paul's Cathedral with [[Castle Baynard]], and London Bridge with Bridge; boundary changes in 2003 removed some of these historic connections.

Each ward elects an [[Alderman]] to the [[Court of Aldermen]], and [[Commoners]] (the City equivalent of a [[Councillor]]) to the [[Court of Common Council]] of the Corporation. Only electors who are [[Freeman of the City of London|Freemen of the City of London]] are eligible to stand. The number of Commoners a ward sends to the Common Council varies from two to ten, depending on the number of electors in each ward. Since the 2003 review it has been agreed that the four more residential wards: [[Portsoken]], [[Queenhithe]], [[Aldersgate]] and [[Cripplegate]] together elect 20 of the 100 Commoners, whereas the business-dominated remainder elect the remaining 80 Commoners. 2003 and 2013 boundary changes have increased the residential emphasis of the mentioned four wards.

Census data provides eight nominal rather than 25 real wards, all of varying size and population. Being subject to renaming and definition at any time, these census 'wards' are notable in that four of the eight wards accounted for 67% of the 'square mile' and held 86% of the population, and these were in fact similar to and named after four City of London wards:

=== Elections ===
The City has a unique electoral system. Most of its voters are representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City. Its ancient wards have very unequal numbers of voters. In elections, both the businesses based in the City and the residents of the City vote.

The City of London Corporation was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], because it had a more extensive electoral franchise than any other borough or city; in fact, it widened this further with its own equivalent legislation allowing one to become a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] without being a [[liveryman]]. In 1801, the City had a population of about 130,000, but increasing development of the City as a central business district led to this falling to below 5,000 after the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It has risen slightly to around 9,000 since, largely due to the development of the [[Barbican Estate]]. In 2009, the business vote was about 24,000, greatly exceeding residential voters.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/2009/02/12/labour-runs-in-city-of-london-poll-against-%E2%80%98get-rich%E2%80%99-bankers/|title=Labour runs in City of London poll against 'get-rich' bankers|date=12 February 2009|author=René Lavanchy|work=[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]|accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the City of London Corporation has not been affected by other municipal legislation over the period of time since then, its electoral practice has become increasingly anomalous. Uniquely for city or borough elections, its elections remain independent-dominated.

The business or "[[non-residential vote]]" was abolished in other UK local council elections by the [[Representation of the People Act 1969]], but was preserved in the City of London. The principal reason given by successive UK governments for retaining this mechanism for giving businesses representation, is that the City is "primarily a place for doing business".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=City of London (Ward Elections) Bill (By Order) – Second Reading|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990224/debtext/90224-48.htm |date=24 February 1999 |column_start=482 |column_end=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 330,000 non-residents constitute the day-time population and use most of its services, far outnumbering residents, who number around 7,000 (2011). By contrast, opponents of the retention of the business vote argue that it is a cause of institutional inertia.&lt;ref&gt;Shaxson, N. (2011). Treasure islands: Tax havens and the men who stole the world. London: The Bodley Head.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[City of London (Ward Elections) Act 2002]], a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/locact02/20020006.htm |title=HMSO '&amp;#39;City of London (Ward Elections) Act 2002 (2002 Chapter vi)'&amp;#39; |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; reformed the voting system and greatly increased the business franchise, allowing many more businesses to be represented. Under the new system, the number of non-resident voters has doubled from 16,000 to 32,000. Previously disenfranchised firms (and other organisations) are entitled to nominate voters, in addition to those already represented, and all such bodies are now required to choose their voters in a representative fashion. Bodies employing fewer than ten people may appoint one voter; those employing ten to 50 people one voter for every five employees; those employing more than 50 people ten voters and one additional voter for each 50 employees beyond the first 50. The Act also removed other anomalies which had been unchanged since the 1850s.

=== The Temple ===
[[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]] (which neighbour each other) are two of the few remaining [[Liberty (division)|liberties]], an old name for a geographic division. They are independent [[extra-parochial area]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090915091838/http://www.agi.org.uk/SITE/UPLOAD/DOCUMENT/Events/AGI2009/papers/MartinLaker.pdf Association for Geographic Information] What place is that then?

They are within the boundaries and liberties of the City, but can be thought of as independent [[enclave]]s. They are both part of [[Farringdon Without]].

=== Other functions ===
[[File:Leadenhall Market In London - Feb 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leadenhall Market]] is a historic market nestled between [[Gracechurch Street]] and [[Lime Street, London|Lime Street]].]]
Within the City, the Corporation owns and runs both [[Smithfield Market]] and [[Leadenhall Market]]. It owns land beyond its boundaries, including [[Corporation of London open spaces|open spaces]] (parks, forests and commons) in and around Greater London, including most of [[Epping Forest]], [[Hampstead Heath]]. [[The Honourable The Irish Society]], a body closely linked with the Corporation, also owns many public spaces in [[Northern Ireland]]. The Corporation owns [[Old Spitalfields Market]] and [[Billingsgate Fish Market]], in the neighbouring [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]]. It owns and helps fund the [[Old Bailey]], the Central Criminal Court for [[England and Wales]], as a gift to the nation, having begun as the City and Middlesex Sessions.

The City has its own independent police force, the [[City of London Police]]—the Common Council (the main body of the Corporation) is the [[police authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/13/contents/enacted/data.htm |title=Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of Greater London is policed by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], based at [[Scotland Yard|New Scotland Yard]].

The City has one hospital, [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], also known as 'Barts'. Founded in 1123, it is located at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], and is undergoing a long-awaited regeneration after doubts as to its continuing use during the 1990s.

The City is the third largest UK patron of the arts. It oversees the [[Barbican Centre]] and subsidises several important performing arts companies.

The London Port Health Authority, which is the responsibility of the Corporation, is responsible for all port health functions on the [[Port of London|tidal part of the Thames]], including various seaports and [[London City Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/port-health-and-animal-health/port-health/Pages/default.aspx|title=London Port Health Authority|publisher=|access-date=16 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416211509/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/port-health-and-animal-health/port-health/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=16 April 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corporation oversees the running of the [[Bridge House Trust]], which maintains [[London Bridge]], [[Blackfriars Bridge]], [[Southwark Bridge]], [[Tower Bridge]] and the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]].

=== The boundary of the City ===
[[File:City of London Sign - geograph.org.uk - 1304788.jpg|thumb|200px|City of London welcome sign]]
The size of the City was constrained by a defensive perimeter wall, known as [[London Wall]], which was built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the late 2nd century to protect their strategic port city. However the boundaries of the City of London no longer coincide with the old city wall, as the City expanded its jurisdiction slightly over time. During the [[medieval]] era, the City's jurisdiction expanded westwards, crossing the historic western border of the original settlement—the [[River Fleet]]—along [[Fleet Street]] to [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. The City also took in the other "City bars" which were situated just beyond the old walled area, such as at Holborn, Aldersgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. These were the important entrances to the City and their control was vital in maintaining the City's special privileges over certain trades.
[[File:Temple-bar-griffin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Dragon statue on the [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] monument, which marks the boundary between the City of London and [[City of Westminster]].]]

Most of the wall has disappeared, but several sections remain visible. A section near the [[Museum of London]] was revealed after the devastation of an air raid on 29 December 1940 at the height of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Other visible sections are at [[St Alphage London Wall|St Alphage]], and there are two sections near the [[Tower of London]]. The River Fleet was [[canal]]ised after the Great Fire of 1666 and then in stages was bricked up and has been since the 18th century one of London's "[[Subterranean rivers of London|lost rivers or streams]]", today underground as a [[storm drain]].

The boundary of the City was unchanged until minor boundary changes on 1 April 1994, when it expanded slightly to the west, north and east, taking small parcels of land from the London Boroughs of [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The main purpose of these changes was to tidy up the boundary where it had been rendered obsolete by changes in the urban landscape. In this process the City also lost small parcels of land, though there was an overall net gain (the City grew from 1.05 to 1.12 square miles). Most notably, the changes placed the (then recently developed) [[Broadgate]] estate entirely in the City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |title=The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620210431/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |archivedate=20 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Southwark]], to the south of the City on the other side of the [[River Thames|Thames]], was within the City between 1550 and 1899 as the ''Ward of [[Bridge Without]]'', a situation connected with the [[Guildable Manor]]. The City's administrative responsibility there had in practice disappeared by the mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] period as various aspects of metropolitan government were extended into the neighbouring areas. Today it is part of the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. The [[Tower of London]] has always been outside the City and comes under the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]].

== Geography ==
The City is England's [[List of ceremonial counties of England|smallest ceremonial county]] by area and population, and the fourth most densely populated. Of the [[Districts of England|326 English districts]], it is the second smallest [[List of English districts by population|by population]], after the [[Isles of Scilly]], and the smallest [[List of English districts by area|by area]]. It is also [[List of cities in the United Kingdom#England|the smallest English]] [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] by population (and in Britain, only two cities in Wales are smaller), and the [[List of smallest cities in the United Kingdom|smallest in the UK by area]].

The elevation of the City ranges from sea level at the Thames to {{convert|21.6|m|ft}} at the junction of High Holborn and Chancery Lane.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ordnance Survey]] data&lt;/ref&gt; Two small but notable hills are within the historic core, [[Ludgate Hill]] to the west and [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] to the east. Between them ran the [[Walbrook]], one of the many [[Subterranean rivers of London|"lost" rivers or streams of London]] (another is the [[River Fleet|Fleet]]).

=== Boundary ===

[http://www.mapping.cityoflondon.gov.uk/geocortex/mapping/?viewer=compass Official boundary map, with wards.]

Beginning in the west, where the City borders Westminster, the boundary crosses the [[Victoria Embankment]] from the Thames, passes to the west of [[Middle Temple]], then turns for a short distance along [[Strand, London|Strand]] and then north up [[Chancery Lane]], where it borders Camden. It turns east along [[Holborn]] to Holborn Circus, and then goes north east to [[Charterhouse Street]]. As it crosses [[Farringdon Road]] it becomes the boundary with Islington. It continues to [[Aldersgate]], goes north, and turns east into some back streets soon after Aldersgate becomes [[Goswell Road]], since 1994 embracing all of the Corporation's Golden Lane Estate. Here, at Baltic Street West, is the most northerly extent. The boundary includes all of the [[Barbican Estate]] and continues east along Ropemaker Street and its continuation on the other side of [[Moorgate]], becomes South Place. It goes north, reaching the border with Hackney, then east, north, east on back streets, with Worship Street forming a northern boundary, so as to include the [[Broadgate]] estate. The boundary then turns south at [[Norton Folgate]] and becomes the border with [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. It continues south into [[Bishopsgate]], and takes some backstreets to Middlesex Street ([[Petticoat Lane]]) where it continues south-east then south. It then turns south-west, crossing the [[Minories]] so as to exclude the [[Tower of London]], and then reaches the river. It then runs up the centre of the Thames, with the exception that [[Blackfriars Bridge]] falls within the City; the City controls [[London Bridge]] (as part of [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge]] ward) but only half of the river underneath it, a feature which is unique in British local administration.

The boundaries are marked by black bollards bearing the City's emblem, and by [[dragon boundary mark]]s at major entrances, such as Holborn. A more substantial monument marks the boundary at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] on Fleet Street.

In some places the financial district extends slightly beyond the boundaries, notably to the north and east, into the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Islington, and informally these locations are seen as part of the "Square Mile". Since the 1990s the eastern fringe, extending into Hackney and Tower Hamlets, has increasingly been a focus for large office developments due to the availability of large sites compared to within the City.

=== Gardens and public art ===
{{See also|List of public art in the City of London}}
[[File:Finsbury Circus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Finsbury Circus]], the largest public open space, seen from [[Tower 42]]]]
The City has no sizeable parks within its boundary, but does have a network of a large number of gardens and small open spaces, many of them maintained by the Corporation. These range from formal gardens such as the one in [[Finsbury Circus]], containing a [[bowling green]] and [[bandstand]], to churchyards such as [[St Olave Hart Street]], to water features and artwork in courtyards and pedestrianised lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardensofthecityoflondon.co.uk |title=Gardens of the City of London |publisher=Gardens of the City of London |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardens include:
* Barber-Surgeon's Hall Garden, [[London Wall]]
* Cleary Garden, [[Queen Victoria Street, London|Queen Victoria Street]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baytrust.org.uk/about/the-history-of-the-bay-trust/ |title=The History of the Bay Trust, Fred Cleary – Founder |publisher=baytrust.org.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109223713/http://baytrust.org.uk/about/the-history-of-the-bay-trust/ |archivedate=9 January 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Finsbury Circus]], Blomfield Street/London Wall/[[Moorgate]]
* [[Jubilee Garden]], [[Houndsditch]]
* Portsoken Street Garden, Portsoken Street/Goodman's Yard
* [[Postman's Park]], [[Little Britain, London|Little Britain]]
* Seething Lane Garden, Seething Lane
* [[St Dunstan-in-the-East]], St Dunstan's Hill
* [[St Mary Aldermanbury]], Aldermanbury
* St Olave Hart Street churchyard, Seething Lane
* St Paul's churchyard, [[St Paul's Cathedral]]
* West Smithfield Garden, [[West Smithfield]]
* Whittington Gardens, College Street

There are a number of private gardens and open spaces, often within courtyards of the larger commercial developments. Two of the largest are those of the [[Inner Temple]] and [[Middle Temple]] Inns of Court, in the far southwest.

The Thames and its riverside walks are increasingly being valued as open space and in recent years efforts have been made to increase the ability for pedestrians to access and walk along the river.

=== Climate ===
The nearest weather station has historically been the London Weather Centre at [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]]/ [[Holborn]], although observations ceased in 2010. Now St. James Park provides the nearest official readings.

The City has an [[Maritime Climate|oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] "Cfb") modified by the [[Urban Heat Island]] in the centre of London. This generally causes higher night-time minima than outlying areas. For example, the August mean minimum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[YR.NO]] |url=http://www.yr.no/place/United_Kingdom/England/Old_Bailey/statistics.html |title=Aug Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; of {{convert|14.7|C|F}} compares to a figure of {{convert|13.3|C|F}} for Greenwich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[MetOffice]] |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/greenwich.html |title=Aug Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Heathrow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[MetOffice]] |url=http://www.yr.no/place/United_Kingdom/England/Heathrow/statistics.html |title=Aug Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas is {{convert|11.6|C|F}} at Wisley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[MetOffice]] |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/wisley.html |title=Aug Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the middle of several square miles of [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. All figures refer to the observation period 1971–2000.

Accordingly, the weather station holds the record for the UK's warmest overnight minimum temperature, {{convert|24.0|C|F}}, recorded on 4 August 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tutiempo |url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/LONDON_WEA_CENTER/04-08-1990/37780.htm |title=Aug 1990 Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum is {{convert|37.6|C|F}}, set on 10 August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tutiempo |url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/London_Weather_Centre/10-08-2003/37790.htm |title=Aug 2003 Max}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absolute minimum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tutiempo |url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/LONDON_WEA_CENTER/12-01-1987/37780.htm |title=Jan 1987 Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the weather station is a mere {{convert|−8.2|C|F}}, compared to readings around {{convert|−15.0|C|F}} towards the edges of London. Unusually, this temperature was during a windy and snowy cold spell (mid-January 1987), rather than a cold clear night—cold air drainage is arrested due to the vast urban area surrounding the city.

The station holds the record for the highest British mean monthly temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tutiempo|url=http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/London_Weather_Centre/07-2006/37790.htm |title=Jul 2006 Mean}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|24.5|C|F}} (mean maximum {{convert|29.2|C|F}}, mean minimum {{convert|19.7|C|F}} during July 2006).

=== Police and security ===
[[File:City of London Police Mitsubishi.jpg|thumb|200px|A City of London Police vehicle on [[Blackfriars Bridge]]]]
The City is a [[police area]] and has its own [[territorial police force|police force]], the [[City of London Police]], separate from the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] covering the remainder of Greater London. The City Police have three police stations, at Snow Hill, [[Wood Street, London|Wood Street]] and [[Bishopsgate]], and an administrative headquarters at Guildhall Yard East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/about-us/Pages/how-to-find-us.aspx|title=How to find us – City of London|website=www.cityoflondon.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force comprises 813 police officers, 85 [[Special Constables]] and 48 [[Police Community Support Officer|PCSOs]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} It is the smallest territorial police force in [[England and Wales]], in both geographic area and the number of police officers.

Where the majority of British police forces have silver-coloured badges, those of the City of London Police are black and gold featuring the City crest. The force has unique red and white chequered cap bands and red and white striped duty arm bands on the sleeve of the tunics of constables and sergeants (red and white being the colours of the City), which in most other British police forces are black and white. City police sergeants and constables wear crested [[Custodian helmet|helmets]] whilst on foot patrol. These helmets do not feature either [[St Edward's Crown]] or the [[Brunswick Star]], which are used on most other police helmets in [[England and Wales]].

The City's position as the United Kingdom's financial centre and a critical part of the country's economy, contributing about 2.5% of the UK's [[gross national product]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/media_centre/keyfacts.htm |title=Key facts |publisher=Cityoflondon.gov.uk |accessdate=30 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023000216/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/media_centre/keyfacts.htm |archivedate=23 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in it becoming a target for political violence. The [[Provisional IRA]] exploded several [[bomb]]s in the early 1990s, including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]].

The area is also spoken of as a possible target for [[al-Qaeda]]. For instance, when in May 2004 the BBC's ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme examined the preparedness of Britain's emergency services for a terrorist attack on the scale of [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], they simulated a chemical explosion on [[Bishopsgate]] in the east of the City.

The [[Ring of steel (London)|"Ring of Steel"]] is a particularly notable measure, established in the wake of the IRA bombings, that has been taken against terrorist threats.

=== Fire brigade ===
{{Main|London Fire Brigade}}
The City has fire risks in many historic buildings, including [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Old Bailey]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]], [[Smithfield Market]], the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and also in numerous high-rise buildings. There is one London Fire Brigade station in the City, at [[Dowgate]], with one [[Fire appliances in the United Kingdom|pumping appliance]].&lt;ref name="zlqtbi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/media/City_of_London.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005231358/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/media/City_of_London.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 October 2007 |title=London Fire Brigade – City of London Profile |publisher=London-fire.gov.uk |accessdate=30 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The City relies upon stations in the surrounding London boroughs to support it at some incidents. The first fire engine is in attendance in roughly five minutes on average, the second when required in a little over five and a half minutes.&lt;ref name="zlqtbi" /&gt; There were 1,814 incidents attended in the City in 2006/2007—the lowest in Greater London. No-one died in an event arising from a fire in the four years prior to 2007.&lt;ref name="zlqtbi" /&gt;

===Power===
There is [[power station]] located in [[Charterhouse Street]] that also provides heat to some of the surrounding buildings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/28/londons-hidden-gas-plant-which-could-heat-and-power-the-future|title=London's hidden gas plant which could heat and power the future|last=Vaughan|first=Adam|date=2017-07-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Office for National Statistics]] recorded the population in 2011 as 7,375;&lt;ref name="2010pop"&gt;{{English district population citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly higher than in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|last census]], 2001,&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00aa.asp|title=City of London Census 2001 profile|accessdate=23 October 2010|website=[[United Kingdom Census 2001|Census 2001]]|publisher=The [[Office for National Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and estimates the population as at mid-2016 to be 9,401. At the 2001 census the ethnic composition was 84.6% [[White people|White]], 6.8% [[British Asian|South Asian]], 2.6% [[Black British|Black]], 2.3% [[British Mixed-Race|Mixed]], 2.0% [[British Chinese|Chinese]] and 1.7% were listed as "[[Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|other]]".&lt;ref name="census" /&gt; To the right is a table showing the change in population since 1801, based on [[Census in the United Kingdom|decadal censuses]]. The first half of the 19th century shows a population of between 120,000–140,000, decreasing dramatically from 1851 to 1991, with a small increase between 1991 and 2001. The only notable boundary change since the first census in 1801 occurred in 1994.

The City's full-time working residents have much higher gross weekly pay than in London and Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland): £773.30 compared to £598.60 and £491.00 respectively.&lt;ref name="nomis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431860/report.aspx?town=city%20of%20london#tabrespop|title=Labour Market Profile: City of London|website=nomis|publisher=The [[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=24 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615052536/https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/la/2038431860/report.aspx?town=city%20of%20london#tabrespop|archive-date=15 June 2011|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large inequality of income between genders (£1,085.90 in men compared to £653.50 in women), though this can be explained by job type and length of employment respectively.&lt;ref name=nomis /&gt; The 2001 Census showed the City as a unique district amongst 376 districts surveyed in [[List of English districts|England]] and [[Districts of Wales|Wales]].&lt;ref name=census /&gt; The City had the highest proportional population increase, one-person households, people with qualifications at degree level or higher and the highest indications of overcrowding.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; It recorded the lowest proportion of households with cars or vans, people who travel to work by car, married couple households and the lowest average household size: just 1.58 people.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; It also ranked highest within the Greater London area for the percentage of people with no religion and people who are employed.&lt;ref name=census /&gt;

== Economy ==
{{See also|Economy of London}}
[[File:Banco de Inglaterra, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 141.JPG|thumb|The [[Bank of England]], on [[Threadneedle Street]], is the central bank of the United Kingdom.]]
The City vies with [[New York City]]'s [[Lower Manhattan|Downtown Manhattan]] as the [[financial centre|financial capital]] of the world; many banking and insurance institutions have their headquarters there. The [[London Stock Exchange]] ([[Stock|shares]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]), [[Lloyd's of London]] (insurance) and the [[Bank of England]] are all based in the City. Over 500 banks have offices in the City, and the City is an established leader in trading in [[Eurobond]]s, [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], energy [[Futures contract|futures]] and global insurance. The [[Alternative Investment Market]], a market for trades in [[Stock|equities]] of smaller firms, is a recent development. In 2009, the City of London accounted for 2.4% of UK GDP.&lt;ref name=citylondon /&gt;

London is the world's greatest [[foreign exchange market]], with much of the trade conducted in the City of London. Of the $3.98&amp;nbsp;trillion daily global turnover, as measured in 2009, trading in London accounted for around $1.85&amp;nbsp;trillion, or 46.7% of the total.&lt;ref name=citylondon /&gt; The [[pound sterling]], the currency of the United Kingdom, is globally the fourth most traded currency and the third most held [[reserve currency]].

Since 1991 [[Canary Wharf]], a few miles east of the City in Tower Hamlets, has become another centre for London's financial services industry which houses many banks and other institutions formerly located in the Square Mile. Although growth has continued in both locations, and there have been relocations in both directions, the Corporation has come to realise that its planning policies may have been causing financial firms to choose Canary Wharf as a location.

=== Headquarters ===
[[File:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|[[Paternoster Square]], since 2004 the home of the [[London Stock Exchange]]]]
Many major global companies have their headquarters in the City, including [[Aviva]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviva.com/about-us/contact-us/|title=Contact us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Aviva}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BT Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/contactbt/index.cfm|title=Contact BT|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=BT Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lloyds Banking Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310191913/http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 March 2009|title=Company Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Lloyds Banking Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Mutual]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmutual.com/ir/contacts.jsp|title=Investor Relations Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Old Mutual}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prudential plc|Prudential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106183040/http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 January 2006|title=Contact|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Prudential}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schroders plc|Schroders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schroders.com/en/contact-us/worldwide-locations/uk/|title=Contact us|accessdate=3 November 2016|publisher=Schroders}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard Chartered Bank|Standard Chartered]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standardchartered.com/uk/contact-us/en/|title=Contact Us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Standard Chartered}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Unilever PLC|Unilever]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx Unilever registered offices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830072007/http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx |date=30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the world's largest law firms are headquartered in the City, including four of the "[[Magic Circle (law firms)|Magic Circle]]" law firms ([[Allen &amp; Overy]], [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]], [[Linklaters]] and [[Slaughter &amp; May]]), as well as other firms such as [[DLA Piper]], [[Eversheds Sutherland]], [[Herbert Smith Freehills]] and [[Hogan Lovells]].

=== Other sectors ===
[[File:Barbican Centre City of London.jpg|thumb|right|Barbican Centre]]
Whilst the financial sector, and related businesses and institutions, continue to dominate, the economy is not limited to that sector. The legal profession has a strong presence, especially in the west and north (i.e., towards the [[Inns of Court]]). Retail businesses were once important, but have gradually moved to the [[West End of London]], though it is now Corporation policy to encourage retailing in some locations, for example at [[Cheapside]] near St Paul's. The City has a number of visitor attractions, mainly based on its historic heritage as well as the [[Barbican Centre]] and adjacent [[Museum of London]], though tourism is not at present a major contributor to the City's economy or character. The City has many pubs, bars and restaurants, and the "night-time" economy does feature in the [[Bishopsgate]] area, towards [[Shoreditch]]. The meat market [[Smithfield Market|at Smithfield]], wholly within the City, continues to be one of London's main markets (the only one remaining in central London) and the country's largest [[butcher|meat market]]. In the east is [[Leadenhall Market]], a fresh food market that is also a visitor attraction.

=== Retail and residential ===
The trend for purely office development is beginning to reverse as the Corporation encourages residential use, albeit with development occurring when it arises on windfall sites. The City has a target of 90 additional dwellings per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm City of London Corporation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512135507/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm |date=12 May 2010 }} Core Strategy&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the extra accommodation is in small pre-[[World War II]] [[listed building]]s, which are not suitable for occupation by the large companies which now provide much of the City's employment. Recent residential developments include "the Heron", a high-rise residential building on the Milton Court site adjacent to the Barbican, and the [[Heron Tower#Heron Plaza|Heron Plaza]] development on Bishopsgate is also expected to include residential parts.

Since the 1990s, the City has diversified away from near exclusive office use in other ways. For example, several hotels and the first [[department store]] opened in the 2000s. A shopping centre was more recently opened at [[One New Change]], [[Cheapside]] (near St Paul's Cathedral) in October 2010, which is open seven days a week. However, large sections remain quiet at weekends, especially in the eastern section, and it is quite common to find shops, [[Public house|pubs]] and cafes closed on these days.

== Landmarks ==

=== Historical buildings ===
Fire, bombing and post-[[World War II]] redevelopment has meant that the City, despite its history, has relatively few intact notable historic structures. They include the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London]] ("the Monument"), [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Guildhall, London|the Guildhall]], the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], [[Dr. Johnson's House]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and a [[:Category:Churches in the City of London|great many churches]], many designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]], who also designed St Paul's. [[2 King's Bench Walk]] and [[Prince Henry's Room]] are notable historic survivors of heavy bombing of [[Temple, London|the Temple]] area, which has largely been rebuilt to its historic form. Another example of a bomb-damaged place having been restored is [[Staple Inn]] on Holborn. A few small sections of the Roman [[London Wall]] exist, for example near the Tower of London and in the Barbican area. Among the twentieth-century [[listed buildings]] are [[Bracken House, London|Bracken House]], the first post World War II buildings in the country to be given statutory protection, and the whole of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] and [[Golden Lane Estate]].

The [[Tower of London]] is not in the City, but is a notable visitor attraction which brings tourists to the southeast of the City. Other landmark buildings with historical significance include the [[Bank of England]], the [[Old Bailey]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]], [[Leadenhall Market]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]. Noteworthy contemporary buildings include a number of modern high-rise buildings (see section below) as well as the [[Lloyd's building]].

;Completed

A growing number of tall buildings and skyscrapers are principally used by the financial sector. Almost all are situated in the eastern side around [[Bishopsgate]], [[Leadenhall Street]] and [[Fenchurch Street]], in the financial core of the City. In the north there is a smaller cluster comprising the [[Barbican Estate]]'s three tall residential towers and the commercial [[CityPoint]] tower. In 2007, the {{convert|100|m|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} tall [[Drapers' Gardens]] building was demolished and replaced by a shorter tower.

The City's buildings of more than {{convert|100|m|0|abbr=on}} in height are:

=== Rail ===
Seven of the eleven [[London Underground]] lines run through the City, serving eleven [[List of London Underground stations|stations]].

The [[Docklands Light Railway]] (DLR) has two [[List of Docklands Light Railway stations|stations]] within the City: [[Bank Underground station|Bank]] and [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]].

Three longer-distance rail termini are in the City: [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]] (services primarily to Essex and East Anglia including [[Southend Airport]]), [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] (services to East London and South Essex) and [[Cannon Street station|Cannon Street]] (services to the South).

Moorgate is the terminus for suburban services from [[Hertfordshire]], and two through-routes operate mostly underground along the main axes:
*''North to South:'' [[City Thameslink railway station|City Thameslink]] (north) and [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]] (south) are both on the [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink line]] with trains running from [[Bedford]] to [[Brighton]], serving [[St Pancras International]] [[Eurostar]] terminus, [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[London Luton Airport|Luton]] airports.
*''East to West:'' [[Crossrail]] is under construction, but upon completion will serve [[Farringdon station|Farringdon]], [[Moorgate station|Moorgate]], and [[Liverpool Street station]]s.

The [[Northern line]] connects to two other main railway termini, [[London Euston station|Euston]]) and ([[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]])); the latter has a direct connection to the City via the [[Waterloo and City Line]].

The City is in [[Travelcard Zone 1]].

=== Road ===
[[File:Space taken vs numbers in City of London (transport).png|thumb|Space taken vs numbers in City of London (transport)&lt;ref&gt;http://democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk/documents/s91800/Appendix+1+-+Traffic+in+the+City+2018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The national [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], [[A10 road (England)|A10]] [[A3 road|A3]], [[A4 road (England)|A4]], and [[A40 road]] routes begin in the City. The City is in the [[London congestion charge]] zone, with the small exception on the eastern boundary of the sections of the A1210/A1211 that are part of the [[Inner Ring Road, London|inner ring road]]. The following bridges, listed west to east (downstream), cross the [[River Thames]]: [[Blackfriars Bridge]], [[Blackfriars Railway Bridge]], [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] (footbridge), [[Southwark Bridge]], [[Cannon Street Railway Bridge]] and [[London Bridge]]; [[Tower Bridge]] is not in the City. The City, like most of central London, is well [[Buses in London|served by buses]], including night buses. Two bus stations are in the City, at [[Aldgate bus station|Aldgate]] on the eastern boundary with Tower Hamlets, and at [[Liverpool Street bus station|Liverpool Street]] by the railway station. There are approximately 28 [[Barclays Cycle Hire]] docking stations in the City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110411092139/https://web.barclayscyclehire.tfl.gov.uk/maps Barclays Cycle Hire Scheme] map of docking station locations&lt;/ref&gt; A number of existing and proposed cycle routes criss-cross the City, as part of the [[London Cycle Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londoncyclenetwork.org.uk/uploaded_files/library/documents/A0_City_v7.pdf London Cycle Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902142354/http://www.londoncyclenetwork.org.uk/uploaded_files/library/documents/A0_City_v7.pdf |date=2 September 2011 }} City of London cycle map&lt;/ref&gt;

=== River ===
One [[London River Services]] pier is on the Thames in the City, [[Blackfriars Millennium Pier]], though the [[Tower Millennium Pier]] lies adjacent to the boundary near the Tower of London. One of the [[Port of London]]'s 25 [[safeguarded wharf|safeguarded wharves]], [[Walbrook Wharf]], is adjacent to Cannon Street station, and is used by the Corporation to transfer waste via the river. Swan Lane Pier, just upstream of London Bridge, is proposed to be replaced and upgraded for regular passenger services, planned to take place in 2012–2015. Before then, Tower Pier is to be extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/pdf/River_Thames_Pier_Plan_Diagram_9_1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615021648/http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/pdf/River_Thames_Pier_Plan_Diagram_9_1.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2011 |title=River Thames Pier Plan |publisher=Lda.gov.uk |accessdate=30 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a public riverside walk along the river bank, opened in stages over recent years. The only section not running along the river is a short stretch at [[Queenhithe]]. The walk along Walbrook Wharf is closed to pedestrians when waste is being transferred onto barges.

=== Travel to work (by residents) ===
According to a survey conducted in March 2011, the methods by which employed residents 16-74 get to work varied widely: 48.4% go on foot; 19.5% via light rail, (i.e. [[London Underground|the Underground]], [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]], etc.); 9.2% work mainly from home; 5.8% take the train; 5.6% travel by bus, minibus, or coach; and 5.3% go by bicycle; with just 3.4% commuting by car or van, as driver or passenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Census: QS701EW Method of travel to work, local authorities in England and Wales|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rft-qs701ew.xls|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=23 November 2013}} Percentages are of all residents aged 16–74 including those not in employment. Respondents could only pick one mode, specified as the journey's longest part by distance.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
[[File:KCLMaughanLibrary2.jpg|thumb|The [[Maughan Library]], [[King's College London]], located on [[Chancery Lane]]]]
The City has only one directly maintained primary school, Sir John Cass's Foundation Primary School at [[Aldgate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirjohncassprimary.org/|title=The homepage of Sir John Cass's Foundation Primary School|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ages 4 to 11). It is a Voluntary-Aided (VA) [[Church of England]] school, maintained by the Education Service of the City of London.

City residents send their children to schools in neighbouring [[Local Education Authority|Local Education Authorities]], such as [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]].

The City controls three independent schools, [[City of London School]] (a boys' school) and [[City of London School for Girls]] in the City, and the [[City of London Freemen's School]] (co-educational day and boarding) in [[Ashtead]], Surrey. The City of London School for Girls has its own preparatory department for entrance at age seven. It is the principal sponsor of The [[City Academy, Hackney]], [[City of London Academy, Islington]], and [[City of London Academy, Southwark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/our_services/Education/schools/schools.htm#muscat_highlighter_first_match City Schools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905022232/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/our_services/Education/schools/schools.htm#muscat_highlighter_first_match |date=5 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City is home to the [[Cass Business School]], [[The London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance]], the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] and parts of three of the [[universities in London]]: the [[Maughan Library]] of [[King's College London]] on [[Chancery Lane]], the business school of [[London Metropolitan University]], and a campus of the [[University of Chicago Graduate School of Business]]. [[University of Law|The College of Law]] has its London campus in [[Moorgate]]. Part of [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]] is on the Barts hospital site at West Smithfield.

=== Public libraries ===
Libraries operated by the Corporation include three lending libraries; Barbican Library, Shoe Lane Library and Artizan Street Library and Community Centre. Membership is open to all – with one official proof of address required to join.

Guildhall Library, and City Business Library are also public reference libraries, specialising in the history of London and business reference resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Leisure_and_culture/Libraries/City_of_London_libraries/index.htm|title=City of London libraries|publisher=|access-date=14 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218012827/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Leisure_and_culture/Libraries/City_of_London_libraries/index.htm|archive-date=18 December 2008|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Author and journalist [[Nicholas Shaxson]] argued that, in return for the financial institutions  based in the City raising loans and finance for the British government, the City "has extracted privileges and freedoms from rules and laws to which the rest of Britain must submit". He further claims that the assistance provided to the institutions based within it, many of which help their rich clients with offshore tax arrangements, mean that the City is "a [[tax haven]] in its own right".&lt;ref name=Shaxson&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaxson|first=Nicholas|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2011/02/london-corporation-city|title=The tax haven in the heart of Britain |accessdate=13 January 2013|newspaper=New Statesman|date=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary [[The Spider's Web: Britain's Second Empire]] asserts the tax haven status that the City provides.

'''Comorians in France''' consist of migrants from [[Comoros]] and their descendants living and working in France.

Outside of [[Mayotte]], where Comorians are an important proportion of the local population, a great Comorian community is settled in [[Metropolitan France]], mostly in [[Marseille]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slateafrique.com/92217/marseille-capitale-comorienne |title=Marseille, la plus grande ville comorienne |publisher=Slate Afrique |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in [[Paris]] and [[Seine-Saint-Denis]], [[Lyon]] and [[Dunkerque]].

'''Galaxy 18''' is a [[Space Systems/Loral]] (SS/L) 1300-series hybrid [[communications satellite]] owned by [[Intelsat]] and located in [[geosynchronous orbit]] at 123°&amp;nbsp;W [[longitude]], serving the continental [[United States]], [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], [[Mexico]], and [[Canada]] with 24 [[C band (IEEE)|C band]], and 24 [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] [[transponders]]. Galaxy 18 is intended to replace [[Galaxy 10R]] which was nearing the end of its design life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080517182823/http://www.intelsat.com/network/satellite/scheduled-launch.asp Intelsat Satellite Launch Schedule&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While this spacecraft is designed for a 15-year service life on orbit, [[Sea Launch]]’s direct insertion{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} into equatorial orbit is expected to yield additional years of fuel life. Galaxy 18 was scheduled to be launched by [[Sea Launch]] on May 8, 2008 but was pushed to May 25{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. It was subsequently moved up to 21 May. The launch took place successfully at 09:43 [[GMT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sea-launch.com/news_releases/nr_080521.html |title=Sea Launch Successfully Delivers Galaxy 18 to Orbit |publisher=Sea Launch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531014715/http://www.sea-launch.com/news_releases/nr_080521.html |archivedate=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free-to-air television ==
Galaxy 18 is the home of many [[free-to-air]] television channels, including approximately three dozen US local stations operated by [[Equity Media Holdings|Equity Broadcasting]]. [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] [[DVB-S]] programming may be received by compliant [[FTA receiver]]s throughout [[North America]] using [[satellite dish]]es as small as one metre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyngsat.com/galaxy18.html Lyngsat: Galaxy 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, available free-to-air channels at 123°W include:
* [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC TV]] ([[KATV-TV|KATV]], [[KKTU-LP|KKTU]], [[KTWO-TV|KTWO]])
* [[Daystar (TV network)|Daystar]]
* [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox TV]] ([[KBTZ]], [[KLMN]], [[KMMF-TV|KMMF]], [[WMQF]])
* [[KWWF]] ([[Independent station (North America)|Ind.]] - [[Waterloo, Iowa]])
* [[Multimedios Television]] ([[KMCC]])
* [[MyNetworkTV]] ([[KFDF-CD]], [[KXNW|KPBI]], [[KARZ-TV|KWBF]], [[KWBM-TV|KWBM]], [[WGMU-LP]])
* [[Pac-12_Network|Pac-12 Networks]]
* [[Retro Jams]]
* RTN Radio
* [[Telefutura]] ([[KAMT-LP|KAMT]], [[KUTF-TV|KUTF]])

* [[Univisión]] ([[KEYU-LP|KEYU]], [[KUTH]], [[KUWF-LP|KUWF]], [[KXUN-LD|KXUN-LP]], [[WNYI]], [[WUMN-TV|WUMN]])
* [[University of Washington|University of Washington TV]] and the [[ResearchChannel]]
* [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs Knowledge Network]]

Free ethnic programming includes [[Aaj TV]], [[Hum TV]], [[Peace TV]] and [[TV One (Pakistan)]].

All Equity Media-owned stations are programmed from a [[centralcasting|central hub]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], with the satellite feeds used to deliver the complete signals to the individual station transmitter sites and to [[cable television]] operators. The future status of these stations is unknown, as [[Equity Media Holdings]] filed for [[chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]] on December 8, 2008.

Y-40 "The Deep Joy" pool first opened on 5 June 2014 and was designed by architect Emanuele Boaretto. It is {{convert|42.15|m|ft|0}} deep, making it the deepest pool in the world. It contains {{convert|4300|m3|usgal|-3}}

It includes platforms at various depths, ranging from {{convert|1.3|m|ft}} to {{convert|12|m|ft}}, before the walls of the pool narrow into a well-like funnel which plunges straight down to {{convert|40|m|ft|0}}. The hotel offers tickets to [[freedive]] and [[scuba dive]].&lt;ref name=Tele1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Y-40 The Deep Joy|url=http://www.y-40.com/en/content/8-discover-y-40|publisher=Y-40|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian freediver [[Umberto Pelizzari]] first measured the depth before the pool was open.&lt;ref name=independent /&gt;

'''Howard 100 News''' was a [[News broadcasting#Radio news|radio news]] team established by American radio personality [[Howard Stern]]. The group was formed in October 2005 following Stern's announced move from regular radio to [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] in 2006. From January 2006 until February 2015, Howard 100 News would broadcast an hourly summary of stories related to Stern, his [[The Howard Stern Show|radio show]], and those associated with it, on [[Howard 100 and Howard 101]]. The team was downsized in 2006 and again in February 2015, with only a few staffers remaining to follow the lives of the unusual Stern fans and callers known as "The Wack Pack."

==Background==
On October 6, 2004, Stern announced the signing of a five-year contract with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] starting from January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?j=p&amp;d=1097121600 |title= Howard To Sirius Satellite In '06 - Predicts End Of Broadcast Radio! |publisher= howardstern.com |first= Jason |last= Kaplan |date= October 6, 2004 |accessdate= August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move followed a crackdown on perceived indecency in broadcasting that occurred following the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|controversy]] surrounding the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] halftime show in February. The incident prompted tighter control over content by station owners and managers, leading to Stern feeling "dead inside" creatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Howard | last = Kurtz | title = Stern On Satellite: A Bruised Flower, Blossoming Anew | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/10/AR2005121001432.html | work = The Washington Post | date= December 11, 2005 | accessdate = September 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-year deal allowed Stern to produce up to three channels on Sirius with a $100 million per year budget for all production, staff and programming costs including the construction of a dedicated studio.&lt;ref name=8k&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.secinfo.com/dsvRa.13ej.htm | title = Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. 8-K For 10/1/04 | publisher = SEC Info | date = October 1, 2004 | accessdate = March 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Launch and original team==
[[Howard 100 and Howard 101]] went live for the first time on September 29, 2005, initially broadcasting silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Sounds Of Silence As Howard Stern Channel Launches On Sirius | url = http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=122230 | work = FMQB | date = September 29, 2005 | accessdate = January 10, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204100526/http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=122230 | archivedate = February 4, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Stern was still under contract with [[Infinity Broadcasting]] until January 1, 2006, he could not broadcast any material from the two channels, or talk on its airwaves. Howard 100 News was created by Talk Radio Consultant Walter Sabo, then in-house at Sirius, who worked with Stern on the concept, and CBS News Anchor Jessica Ettinger Gottesman, then an anchor at CBS-owned 1010 WINS-AM all-news radio. Howard 100 News was crafted to sound like 1010 WINS, and aired its first newscast on October 19, 2005, after off-air trial runs. Original content included radio personality [[Bubba the Love Sponge]] interviewing Stern's former writer [[Jackie Martling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Howard Stern Channel Debuts "Howard 100 News" | url = http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=135949 | work = FMQB | date = October 19, 2005 | accessdate = January 10, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101006070647/http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=135949 | archivedate = October 6, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team eventually grew to 17 staffers, many of whom were professional journalists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?j=n&amp;d=1129694400 |title= Isn't He Wonderful |publisher= HowardStern.com |first= Jason |last= Kaplan |date= October 20, 2005 |accessdate= January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Jessica Ettinger]], who, while still employed at CBS, used the on-air name Erica Phillips, as well as [[Lisa Glasberg]] (known as Lisa G.), and Steve Langford. Just days after being fired from [[WNYW-TV]], the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox TV]] station in New York, reporter [[Penny Crone]] was hired to work for Howard 100 News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard |last=Huff |title=Stern's news is Pennywise |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2006/01/06/2006-01-06_stern_s_news_is_pennywise.html |work=New York Daily News |date=January 6, 2006 |accessdate=January 10, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crone has since left broadcasting and now works as a licensed real estate agent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elliman.com/real-estate-agent/penny-crone/673 Penny Crone profile on DouglasElliman Real Estate website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The team now==
In June 2006, most of the Howard 100 News staffers were let go. Stern said that this was because it needed downsizing. News director Liz Aiello departed to become the vice president and general manager of [[Martha Stewart Living Radio]] on Sirius XM.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/08-04-2006/entertainment/ent_radio/story/440436p-371030c.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=New York News, Traffic, Sports, Weather, Photos, Entertainment, and Gossip - NY Daily News }} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erica Phillips, who also worked at [[CBS News]] under her real name, became news director before assuming program director duties at other Sirius channels. Reporters Penny Crone and George Flowers left the team in January 2007 due to budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/489252p-412048c.html |location=New York |work=Daily News |title=New York Arts - NYC Entertainment News - NY Daily News |date=April 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125161259/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/489252p-412048c.html |archivedate=January 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the other staffers were released in February 2015, leaving [[Shuli Egar]] and [[Jon Leiberman]], who had developed expertise covering Stern's unusual fans and callers, known as "The Wack Pack."  They are continuing those assignments, under News Director Brad Driver. The news team is no longer referred to as Howard 100 News.

{{wiktionary}}

'''''Hromada''''' ({{lang-uk|[[:uk:громада|Громада]]}}) is a Ukrainian term for [[community]] or public, more precise an association of the people united by mutual interest, position or goal, widely known in [[Ukraine]]. Similar terms could be found in [[Poland]] and [[Belarus]].

In history of [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] such associations appeared first as [[peasant]] communes, which gathered their meetings for discussing and resolving current issues. In the 19th century there were number of political organization with the same name.

Hromada means not only social association of some people, but in broader sense a symbolic unity of any territorial population or the whole national society.

Name "hromada" was frequently used by political and social organizations, [[newspaper]]s in [[Ukraine]].

At present, the term is more often applied in Ukraine, as a "territorial commune" ({{lang-uk|[[:uk:Територіальна громада|Територіальна громада]]}}) naming the population of any region. The [[Constitution of Ukraine]] and some other laws, including the "Law on local self-governance", delegate certain rights and obligations for "hromada". But "hromada" does not have the rights of a [[Legal person|legal entity]]. In his draft [[Ukraine's constitution|constitutional]] amendments of June 2014 [[Ukrainian President]] [[Petro Poroshenko]] proposed changing the [[administrative divisions of Ukraine]], which should include regions, districts and "hromadas".&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html Poroshenko suggests granting status of regions to Crimea, Kyiv, Sevastopol, creating new political subdivision of 'community'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701043549/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html |date=2014-07-01 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (26 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
[[File:Hromada (Geneva) vol 5 no 1.jpg|thumb|Swiss magazine "Hromada"|100px]]
In the [[History of Ukraine]] the word was used to denote [[medieval commune]]s in Ukraine. There also were several political entities such as [[Hromada (political party)]] (modern Ukraine) and [[Hromada (secret society)]] (in [[Russian Empire]]).

[[Mykhailo Drahomanov]] in his exile was publishing Hromada magazine in [[Switzerland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="909">'''Indygenat''' or '[[naturalization]]' in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was the grant of nobility to foreign nobles. To grant ''indygenat'', a foreign noble had to submit proof of their service to the Republic, together with proof of nobility issued by a foreign court, swear an oath of allegiance, and buy land. Grants of ''indygenat'' were limited in the history of Poland to just over 400 foreign nobles. It was granted by the King, after 1641 it was only valid with approval of the [[General sejm]] (parliament).

Most Kenyans in the UK are ethnically [[South Asia]]n Kenyans who, like those in Uganda, were forced out during the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/born_abroad/countries/html/kenya.stm&lt;/ref&gt; This community has a substantial cluster in Leicester and London.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/born_abroad/countries/html/kenya.stm&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent growth may now be coming from ethnically [[black people|black]] African Kenyans, mirroring wider trends across the continent of economic migration to the richer industrialised nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/born_abroad/countries/html/kenya.stm&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a small number of Kenyan-born people who are the children of British civil servants based there before the end of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/born_abroad/countries/html/kenya.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
The [[2001 UK Census]] recorded 129,633 Kenyan-born British residents.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |title=Country-of-birth database |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |accessdate=16 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617032129/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/23/34792376.xls |archivedate=17 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent figure in 2009 has been estimated at 203,000 by the [[Office for National Statistics]].&lt;ref name="2009 estimates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/Population-by-country-of-birth-and-nationality-Oct08-Sep09.zip |title=Estimated population resident in the United Kingdom, by foreign country of birth (Table 1.3) |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |date=September 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vvnKhoUi?url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/Population-by-country-of-birth-and-nationality-Oct08-Sep09.zip |archivedate=22 January 2011 |df= }} Figure given is the central estimate. See the source for 95 per cent [[confidence interval]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest proportion of Kenyan-born British residents are found in the capital, [[London]], where around half of the Kenyan-born population in Britain resides. There are also significant populations in the [[South East England|South East]] and the [[East Midlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/born_abroad/countries/html/kenya.stm|title=Kenya|work=Born Abroad|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NSS-806''' ('''New Skies Satellite 806'''), before '''Intelsat 806''', is a [[communications satellite]] originally operated by [[Intelsat]]. Launched in 1998 it was operated in [[geostationary orbit]] at a longitude of 47 degrees west for around 15 years. It is currently located in the orbital position of 47.5 degrees west longitude, was initially operated by [[Intelsat]], orbited at 40.5 degrees west, and was purchased by [[SES World Skies]] (a subsidiary of [[SES S.A.|SES]]).

== Satellite ==
NSS-806 is equipped with 28 [[transponder]]s in [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and 3 in [[Ku band]], making transmissions for the [[Americas]] and parts of [[Europe]]. In order to receive the signal it requires a monofocal antenna (LNBF antenna in the center), a [[LNBF]] for C band (5150 [[Hertz (unit)|MHz]]) and a digital receiver compatible with C band. The NSS-806 emits its signal in circular polarization.

== Launch ==
The launch of NSS-806 made use of a [[Atlas II]] rocket flying from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. The launch took place at 00:16 UTC on February 28, 1998, with the spacecraft entering a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]]. NSS-806 subsequently fired its apogee motor to achieve [[geostationary orbit]].

== Health and replacement ==
In July 2017, seven years past its 12 year intended design life, NSS-806 lost the use of 12 of its 39 transponders.  NSS-806's replacement, [[SES-14]], was scheduled to be launched in first quarter of 2018 on a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]], and SES predicted that the transponder failure would result in a revenue loss of between 7 and 9 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacenews.com/ses-loses-12-transponders-on-nss-806-satellite-says-impact-is-temporary/ |title=SES loses 12 transponders on NSS-806 satellite, says impact is temporary |first=Caleb |last=Henry |work=Space News |date=July 31, 2017 |accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month, SES arranged to swap flights so that SES-12 would launch in January 2018 on an [[Ariane 5]], with [[SES-12]], originally scheduled for that flight, now launching on the Falcon 9 later in Q1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacenews.com/ses-flips-spacex-arianespace-launches-to-speed-nss-806-replacement/ |title=SES flips SpaceX, Arianespace launches to speed NSS-806 replacement |first=Caleb |last=Henry |work=Space News |date=August 28, 2017 |accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SES-14 was launched from [[Guiana Space Centre|Kourou]] on 25 January, 2018, but was placed in an incorrect orbit due to a launch vehicle anomaly.  SES reported that the all-electric SES-14 would take four more weeks than originally planned to reach its operating orbit, but that the satellite was healthy and was expected to meet its designed life time.  SES-14's in-service date, originally set for July 2018, was expected to be pushed back until at least August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacenews.com/satellites-placed-into-incorrect-orbits-by-ariane-5-can-be-recovered-owners-say/ |title=Satellites placed into incorrect orbits by Ariane 5 can be recovered, owners say |first=Caleb |last=Henry |work=Space News |date=January 26, 2018 |accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ses.com/press-release/ses-14-good-health-and-track-despite-launch-anomaly |title=SES-14 in good health and on track despite launch anomaly |first=Markus |last=Payer |work=SES |date=January 26, 2018 |accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oasis Charitable Trust''' (known as '''Oasis''') is a UK-based [[Christian]] [[registered charity]].  It was founded by the Reverend [[Steve Chalke]] in September 1985. Chalke had been assistant minister at [[Tonbridge]] Baptist Church, [[Kent]], for four years. He left this job with the aim of setting up a hostel for homeless young people. Oasis now has over 5,000 staff in the UK as well as thousands more volunteers.

Since its foundation Oasis has also developed into a family of charities now working on four continents (11 countries) around the world, with the goal of delivering housing, education, training, youthwork and healthcare.  Oasis is now a significant [[voluntary sector]] provider, delivering services for local authorities and national governments, as well as self funded initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oasisglobal.org/|title=Home - Oasis Global Site|website=www.oasisglobal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oasis currently works in 51 local neighbourhoods – 35 of which are in the UK – where it seeks to bring together the resources, expertise and infrastructure that it has developed over the years, in order to build on existing strengths and assets in the local community. Oasis' aim is always to serve and respect all people regardless of their gender, race, ethnic origin, religion, age, sexual orientation or physical and mental capability and to work with the whole community to create a neighbourhood in which people feel known, are able to thrive, achieve their God-given potential and build deep and nourishing relationships.

==Oasis Church Waterloo==
In 2003, under [[Steve Chalke]]'s leadership, Oasis, having become responsible for the buildings of Christ Church and Upton Chapel, in [[Lambeth|Waterloo]], central [[London]], worked with the existing members there to form what was initially known as Church.co.uk. Since then it has been renamed as Oasis Church, Waterloo.

Christ Church and Upton Chapel actually began its life as Surrey Chapel in 1783, and was to provide a major influence in the start of the Ragged School Movement – which provided schools for local children from poor homes – and also supported the birth of the Shaftesbury Society, the YMCA and the Bible Society. In the 1800s it was also influential in the anti-slavery movement; William Wilberforce and friends made its building a venue for many of their anti-slavery meetings, and its spire, built in 1867, is named the Lincoln Tower, donated in memory of Abraham Lincoln who was both inspired and supported by in his work to achieve the emancipation of the slaves of North America through the network of friends based in London.

That same commitment to serve Christ through ‘loving God’ and ‘loving our neighbours as ourselves’ continues to underpin the work of the present day church. Over the years since 2003 a wide range of community services focussed on the half-mile radius around the building, have been developed including a children’s centre, a primary school, a secondary school, various adult education opportunities, a foodbank, a debt advice centre, a community farm, a coffee shop, as well as becoming responsible for the local public library and launching various other youth projects and programmes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oasiswaterloo.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Further Oasis churches have developed running alongside the communities of the Oasis Academies in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Oldham]], [[Oasis Academy Brightstowe|Brightstowe]], [[Bristol]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], Southampton ([[Lord's Hill]] &amp;  [[Mayfield Park, Southampton|Mayfield]]), [[Immingham]] and [[Wintringham]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oasischurch.info/church_default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oasis church network has five values which are at the heart of their work; inclusion, interdependence, intimacy, involvement and influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oasiswaterloo.org/vision-goals-and-values|title=Vision, goals and values - Oasis Waterloo Hub|website=www.oasiswaterloo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stop The Traffik==

Stop The Traffik is one of the Oasis subsidiary charities. It is a global coalition working in nearly 100 countries and in partnership with multiple other charitable organisations, businesses and anti-trafficking agencies with the goal of disrupting and preventing human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopthetraffik.org/uk/|title=STOP THE TRAFFIK - People shouldn't be bought and sold|website=STOP THE TRAFFIK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oasis Aquila Housing==

Oasis Aquila Housing delivers bespoke and effective services for vulnerably housed and homeless people, in the North East as well as in South London. Annually it supports over 1000 people with housing needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oasisaquilahousing.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Oasis Foundation==
The newest part of the Oasis family, is dedicated to demonstrating the effectiveness of Oasis' model of community engagement and to encouraging and facilitating its replication. The Foundation focuses on commissioning and disseminating research, on informing and influencing social policy but, most importantly, on promoting and supporting the role of local churches in public service delivery as an integrated part of their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oasis.foundation/|title=Oasis Foundation|website=oasis.foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oasis Community Learning==
Oasis Community Learning&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1109288|Oasis Community Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of OAsis Trust's subsidiary charities. It is an umbrella group to govern the Oasis Academies which are schools classed as [[Academy (England)|academies]]. The first three Oasis academies in [[Enfield Lock]], [[Grimsby]] and [[Immingham]], opened in September 2007, with six more, two in [[Bristol]], two in [[Southampton]], two in [[Oasis Academy Coulsdon|Croydon]] and one in [[City of Salford|Salford]], opening in September 2008. Since then, OAsis has grown to be one of the country's largest Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs) and is currently responsible for 47 schools around England; a mix of primary, secondary and all-through academies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oasiscommunitylearning.org/academies/&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberia's populated [[Pepper Coast]] is composed of mostly [[mangrove]] forests while the sparse inland is forested, later opening to a plateau of drier grasslands. Since 1989, Liberia has been in a state of flux witnessing two [[civil war]]s, the [[First Liberian Civil War]] (1989–1996), and the [[Second Liberian Civil War]] (1999–2003), displacing hundreds of thousands of people and devastating the country's [[Economy of Liberia|economy]].

'''Radio Canada International''' ('''RCI''') is the [[international broadcasting]] service of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC). Prior to 1970, RCI was known as the CBC International Service. The broadcasting service was also previously referred to as the "Voice of Canada". In June 2012, shortwave services were terminated and RCI became accessible exclusively via the Internet. It also reduced to services in five languages (in contrast with the 14 languages it used in 1990). CBC also ended production of RCI news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radio Canada International goes off-air, moving online-only after 67 years of shortwave service|url=http://j-source.ca/article/radio-canada-international-goes-air-moving-online-only-after-67-years-shortwave-service|accessdate=June 6, 2013|newspaper=J-Source|date=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== The early years (1942&amp;ndash;1953) ===
The idea for creating an international radio voice for Canada was first proposed as far back as the 1930s. The CBC Archives website, however, has no archived news stories showing the historical documents where this early shortwave service is discussed. Several studies commissioned by the CBC Board of Governors in the late 1930s had come to the conclusion that Canada needed a radio service to broadcast a Canadian point of view to the world.

By the early 1940s, this need was also recognized by a series of Parliamentary Broadcasting Committees. Finally, in 1942, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon MacKenzie King]] announced that Canada would begin a [[shortwave]] radio service that would keep members of the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] in touch with news and entertainment from home. The CBC International Service became a reality with the signing of an Order-in-Council on September 18, 1942.
[[Image:RCI Tantramar.jpg|thumb|300px|RCI transmitter station outside [[Sackville, New Brunswick]]. Designed by CBC's chief architect D. G. McKinstry, the building opened in 1944 and was scheduled to be closed in 2012. A portion of the large RCI shortwave antenna system is visible in the background. The antennas were removed in 2014]]
By the end of 1944, both the production facilities and the transmitting plant were ready for test broadcasts. These tests, which began on December 25, 1944, were broadcast to Canadian troops in Europe in both English and French. [[Psychological warfare]] in German to Europe began in December 1944 as well. The German section was staffed by refugees such as [[Helmut Blume]] and [[Eric Koch]] and would go on to broadcast "[[denazification]]" programming as well as broadcasts aimed at East Germany during the [[Cold War]].

In early 1945, it was announced that the CBC International Service was ready and would go on the air for real on February 25 using the name the "Voice of Canada".

By 1946, the CBC International Service had expanded to include regular transmissions in Czech and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Beginning in July, special once-a-week programs were broadcast to [[Scandinavia]] in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and Danish and later in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], as well.

In November 1946, daily broadcasts started to the [[Caribbean]] in English. There were also Sunday night programs broadcast to Cuba, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador in Spanish and to Brazil in Portuguese.

Daily Spanish and Portuguese transmissions began on July 6, 1947. At around the same time as the expansion into the Caribbean and [[Latin America]], the CBC International Service became involved with the newly formed [[United Nations]]. United Nations broadcasts through the CBC International Service continued until November 29, 1952, when they were transferred to larger shortwave facilities run by the [[Voice of America]].

=== Early Cold War broadcasting (1950&amp;ndash;1967) ===
Throughout its early years, the CBC International Service concentrated on broadcasting to Western Europe in the aftermath of World War II.

By the early 1950s several international shortwave stations began to beam programs into the [[Soviet bloc]] countries in an effort to circumvent heavy censorship of world news to their citizens.

* The CBC International Service's [[Russian language|Russian-language]] transmissions were jammed during the 1950s and into the mid 1960s stopping about 1967.
* On March 4, 1961, the Danish, Dutch, Italian, Norwegian, and Swedish services were all discontinued.
* In addition, the German service was reoriented from its previous emphasis on [[Federal Republic of Germany|West Germany]] to focus on [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]].

New English and French programs directed to Africa were added giving the International Service direct coverage to every continent except Asia.

=== The Cold War era (1967&amp;ndash;1991) ===
The CBC International Service played a major role in covering Canada's Centennial celebrations in 1967. Ceremonies from coast to coast were carried over short-wave to the world on July 1, 1967 as Canada marked its 100th birthday.

In July 1970, the service was renamed Radio Canada International.

The change took place because it was felt that RCI should have its own identity, separate from the CBC domestic network, even though RCI had just been fully integrated into the CBC system.

On November 7, 1971, RCI inaugurated its new 250&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters which were five times more powerful than the existing units. This significantly improved RCI's signal quality in Europe and Africa.

Canada recognized the People's Republic of China in 1971. Before beginning its Mandarin Chinese service, RCI produced a 40-week series called Everyday English which was broadcast in 1988 and early 1989 over local stations in [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Guangzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/435781803.html|title=Ballet marks up another surplus|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|p=E27|date=October 21, 1988|accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an estimated audience of almost 20 million, the course was a huge success.

Just 10 months after beginning the Chinese broadcasts, RCI started a series of [[Arabic]] broadcasts to the Middle East. This coincided with the United Nations effort in the [[Persian Gulf]] to support the [[Gulf war]], of which Canada was a participant.

=== RCI under threat (1991–2006) ===
In early 1991, facing further budget deficits, the Government of Canada ordered an across-the-board budget cut. Every ministry and [[Crown corporation]], including the CBC, was required to participate. After evaluating its own budget, the CBC decided it could no longer pay for Radio Canada International without extra funding from the federal government. To save the service, RCI Program Director Allan Familiant announced a major restructuring that took effect on March 25, 1991. As a result, six of the thirteen languages included in the programming (Czech, German, [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Japanese, [[Polish language|Polish]], and Portuguese) were discontinued. There was also a short-wave program that went out to sub-Saharan Africa that was discontinued in 2000. 

While the English and French services survived, all RCI-produced programming (except for news broadcasts) were eliminated and replaced with CBC Domestic network programs. Since then, some RCI-produced programs in English and French have been restored. RCI then began a two audio stream, which became a three audio stream programming delivery structure after 2000.

'''Initial programming delivery structure (2000-2004)'''
* RCI-1 English / French
* RCI-2 French / Multilingual

'''Later programming delivery structure (2004-2006)'''
* RCI-1 English
* RCI-2 French
* RCI-3 Multilingual

These audio streams were available from RCI's website as well as across Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa, utilizing the [[Hotbird]]-6 satellite. In late 2006 the online streams were eliminated in favour of a single online multilingual stream.

On December 1, 2005, Radio Canada International began broadcasting its program across North America as '''RCIplus''', utilizing the [[Sirius]] satellite radio system. This was part of a CBC/Radio-Canada selection of satellite channels which included national versions of domestic radio stations from [[CBC Radio]] and [[Première Chaîne]].

=== RCI Viva, the Internet Era (2006-2012) ===
Following an internal review in the summer of 2006, Radio Canada International announced a restructuring of its programming output. Its homepage press release read: "Radio Canada International is proud to announce that it will launch its new English programming on Monday, October 30th. In the interim, our current shows will be replaced by two programs, from October the 2nd to the 29th."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/rci/en/quoideneuf/26346.shtml|title=Accueil|first=Radio Canada|last=International|website=RCI - Français|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, 2006 '''Radio Canada International''' relaunched its English and French programming with a new focus on information for new immigrants to Canada as well as continuing to broadcast to the world, moving away from news and current affairs. It also increased its broadcast hours to 12 hours a week, which can be heard via satellite and online,&lt;ref name="history01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcinet.ca/english/about-us/historique/|title=RCI // About Us|website=www.rcinet.ca|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its [[shortwave]] hours are restricted and remain unchanged.

A new Internet service called '''RCI Viva''' acted as an online portal for new Canadian immigrants. RCI Viva is an on-demand listening portal as well as an [http://www.rcinet.ca/rci/includes/rcilive.asx online stream] as '''RCI Viva''', whereas listeners in North America can listen via satellite subscription radio from [[Sirius Canada]] entitled '''RCI plus'''. Both RCI Viva and RCI plus used a similar multilingual schedule.

Listeners in Europe were still able to listen to RCI's three channels in English, French and multilingual. An interim program, on the English-language service during October called ''Canada Today in Transition'' was broadcast as a single program across Europe, Africa and the Middle East, replacing the two regular editions for Europe and Africa. It was hosted by ex-''Canada Today for Africa'' presenter Carmel Kilkenny. The new two-hour English-language flagship program is called '''''The Link''''' and is hosted by [[Marc Montgomery (presenter)|Marc Montgomery]], replacing RCI's previous weekday programs ''Canada Today'', ''Media Zone'', ''Sci-Tech File'', and ''Business Sense''. Its French-language counterpart is called '''''Tam-Tam Canada''''' and is presented by [[Raymond Desmarteau]], which replaced ''Le Canada en direct'', ''Le sens des affaires'' and its previous current-affairs based shows. Programs in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] were relatively unchanged. ''The Link'' was also repeated on [[CBC Radio One]], as part of the ''[[CBC Radio Overnight]]'' lineup.

In November 2006, [[Radio Sweden]]'s medium-wave broadcast from Solsberg ceased regular transmissions as a result of a modification in its [[shortwave]] time-share agreement which had Radio Sweden to broadcast to North America via RCI's transmitters in [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]] and RCI to Europe via Radio Sweden until Sackville's closure in 2012.

=== Budget cuts and the end of shortwave broadcasting (2012) ===
On April 4, 2012 an approximate 80% budget cut to the International service from $12.3 million a year to $2.3 million a year was announced by RCI Director Hélène Parent. In the 2012 federal budget, a 10% funding reduction was announced for the domestic broadcaster, CBC/Radio-Canada.  The Crown corporation subsequently translated this to an 80% reduction to the International service under its financial and managerial control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solyon|first=Catherine|title=CBC cuts gut cherished Radio Canada International|url=https://montrealgazette.com/cuts+cherished+Radio+Canada+International/6444023/story.html|accessdate=May 12, 2012|newspaper=The Gazette|date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes effectively ended broadcasting by RCI via shortwave and satellite. RCI News service (as a separate news service from the CBC/Radio-Canada derived news) ended, and the Brazilian and Russian sections closed.

All shortwave transmissions (including those from [[CKCX|the Sackville Relay Station]] in [[Sackville, New Brunswick]]), satellite, and all broadcast programming ended on June 26, 2012. In addition:

* All contractual and temporary staff, along with fully two-thirds of permanent staff, lost their jobs.
* [[China Radio International]] and other international broadcasters which leased transmitter time from RCI had their contracts terminated
* The Sackville Relay Station's transmitter complex in [[Sackville, New Brunswick]] was dismantled in winter/spring 2014 and CBC/Radio-Canada plans are to sell the property once decommissioning and remediation is completed.
* As of 2014, RCI consists of a skeleton staff based in Toronto and Montreal for producing podcasts and limited webpage content in 5 languages (Spanish, Arabic, French, English, and Mandarin).

== Station ==

=== Interval signal ===
RCI's [[interval signal]] is the first four notes of ''[[O Canada]]'' played on a [[piano]], followed by "Radio Canada International" pronounced in English, and then French.
* Prior to the late 1980s, there were two interval signals used. One was the aforementioned piano signal and the other was the same four notes of ''[[O Canada]]'' played on an [[auto harp]].
* This second (now decommissioned) tuning signal was also known as a "slewing signal". This slewing signal was used whenever RCI's transmitter beams had to be reversed (say from broadcasting to Europe to the western United States) quickly.
* The slewing signal was dropped when computer control was added to RCI's transmitter plant in the mid-to-late 1980s.
* From the late 1970s to the early 2000s a jazz version of the French-Canadian folk song "{{ill|Vive la Canadienne|fr}}" (arranged by [[Lee Gagnon]] and published on LP in 1976) was used as an additional signature tune.

=== Studios ===
The main [[studio]]s for RCI have been in [[Montreal]] since RCI was created in 1943&amp;ndash;44.

RCI as a corporate entity (separate from its broadcasting operations) has also been based in Montreal since its inception in the 1940s.

=== Budget ===
Figures are Canadian dollars ([[Canadian dollar|CAD]]).
*2003: 14.2 million / year
*2004: 14.4 million
*2011: 12.3 million
*2013:  2.3 million
RCI's Gross Cost per Canadian resident (per year) was: CAD{{nbsp}}0.38 (2003, 2004).

=== Hours of programming produced (per week) ===
Note: there are 168 hours in a week (24 hours × 7 days).

RCI's Programming Production (historical)
* 1950s: 85 (WWII recovery phase for broadcaster)
* 1960s: 80 (Language services to Western Europe cut, Russian &amp; Ukrainian launched)
* 1970s: 98 (Cold War détentes)
* 1980s: 134 (late Cold War)

In the 1990s RCI's programming output peaked
* 1990: 195
* 1996: 175

As of May 15, 2012 space segment delivery of RCI programming ceased.

== {{anchor|Sackville Relay Station}}Sackville relay station ==
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, RCI's parent, owned and operated the Sackville [[transmitter]] site ([[CKCX]]). The site was on the [[Tantramar Marshes]], several kilometres east of [[Sackville, New Brunswick]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fybush.com/site-of-the-week-762012-radio-canada-international-sackville-nb-1998 Site of the Week 7/6/2012: Radio Canada International, Sackville, NB, 1998], ''Scott Fybush'', July 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; RCI leased or bartered its spare transmission capacity with other international broadcasters. Sackville was used by [[Radio Japan]], [[China Radio International]], the [[Voice of Vietnam]], the [[BBC World Service]], [[Deutsche Welle]]  and [[Radio Korea]] as part of a transmitter-time exchange agreement. Canada's only high-power [[shortwave]] relay station, Sackville also broadcast [[CBC North]] to northern Quebec and [[Nunavut]].
 
The CBC-SRC network runs three 1&amp;nbsp;kW relays of domestic radio, one of which originated from Sackville. Sackville's northern-hemisphere transmission-targeting capabilities were similar to those of the Wertachtal relay station in [[Bavaria]]. Its site layout was similar to Wertachtal's, with a few differences. Wertachtal has three arms of [[HRS type antennas]] spaced at about 120 degrees, allowing for near-360-degree global coverage.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

The Sackville site was built in 1938 for local CBC broadcasting over [[CBA (AM)|CBA]]. Five years later, two RCA shortwave transmitters were installed. In 1970, all CBC operations moved to [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]] for the installation of new [[Rockwell Collins#Shortwave transmitters|Collins transmitters]]. During the mid-1980s, the RCA transmitters were replaced by three [[Harris Corporation|Harris]] transmitters.

With the end of Radio Canada International's shortwave service in June 2012, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation tried to sell the Sackville transmitter complex to another international broadcaster or a wind-farm company. According to CBC transmission director Martin Marcotte, "[The Sackville complex] will be fairly costly to dismantle and as a last resort we would dismantle the facility, return it to bare land as it was when we first acquired that site."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2012/06/26/nb-rci-transmission-ends.html "RCI ends shortwave broadcast - Sackville, N.B. transmitters will be sold]", ''CBC News'', June 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] granted a CBC request to revoke CKCX's broadcast license effective November 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2012/2012-602.htm|title=ARCHIVED - CFFB Iqaluit – New transmitters in Puvirnituq, Kuujjuarapik, Inukjuak, Salluit and Kuujjuaq (Fort Chimo)|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|last=(CRTC)|website=crtc.gc.ca|accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When no  purchase offers were received for the complex, its antennas were dismantled and the transmission towers demolished in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sackville, N.B. residents to lose landmark radio transmission towers|url=http://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/sackville-n-b-residents-to-lose-landmark-radio-transmission-towers-1.1707350|accessdate=March 2, 2014|newspaper=CTV News|date=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the property was sold to a non-profit consortium of New Brunswick Mi'kmaq bands known as Mi'gmawe'l Tplu'taqnn. The intend use of the property was not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sold! Mi'kmaq group confirms purchase of CBC land|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/rdi-tower-site-sold-1.3965475|date=February 3, 2017|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology ===
The Sackville facility was computerized in a main control room. Frequencies, antennas and input feeds are switched in accordance with internationally agreed-on schedules which were renegotiated twice per year. In 2012, there were nine transmitters in operation: three 100&amp;nbsp;kW, three 250 kW and three 300&amp;nbsp;kW. Although the site was capable of using 500&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters, the end of the [[Cold War]] and improved shortwave-frequency coordination made an upgrade to 500&amp;nbsp;kW unnecessary.

New [[ABB Group|Brown Boveri]] digital transmitters used [[phase-shift keying]] (PSK) and had 250&amp;nbsp;kW output. Newer [[Thales Group|Thales]] 300&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters could use [[amplitude and phase-shift keying]] (APSK), the design successor partially based on PSK modulation).

All modern Sackville shortwave transmitters employed [[dynamic carrier control]] (DCC), automatically reducing the [[carrier wave]] in the presence of low-level (or no) audio.
With no audio (silence) the carrier power was reduced by 50 percent; a 250&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter put out a carrier of 125&amp;nbsp;kW during audio pauses, saving power.

{{Slavery}}
'''Slavery in the Ottoman Empire''' was a legal and significant part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s economy and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html|title=Supply of Slaves|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main sources of slaves were war captives and organized enslavement expeditions in [[North Africa|North]] and [[East Africa]], [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Balkans]], and the [[Caucasus]]. It has been reported that the selling price of slaves fell after large military operations.&lt;ref name="Spyropoulos"&gt;Spyropoulos Yannis, Slaves and freedmen in 17th- and early 18th-century Ottoman Crete, ''Turcica'', 46, 2015, p. 181, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]]), the administrative and political center of the Empire, about a fifth of the population consisted of slaves in 1609.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History].&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteenth- and 17th-century customs statistics suggest that Istanbul's additional slave import from the [[Black Sea]] may have totaled around 2.5 million from 1450 to 1700.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge World History of Slavery: Volume 3, AD 1420–AD 1804&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after several measures to ban slavery in the late 19th century, the practice continued largely unabated into the early 20th century. As late as 1908, female slaves were still sold in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Dursteler2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Dursteler|title=Venetians in Constantinople: Nation, Identity, and Coexistence in the Early Modern Mediterranean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LF8uer6PMfAC&amp;pg=PA72|year=2006|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8324-8|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual slavery]] was a central part of the Ottoman slave system throughout the history of the institution.&lt;ref name="Schierbrand1886"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/03/28/106300694.pdf|title=Slaves sold to the Turk; How the vile traffic is still carried on in the East.

A member of the Ottoman slave class, called a ''[[Wiktionary:kul#Turkish|kul]]'' in [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]], could achieve high status. [[castration|Castrated]] [[harem]] guards and [[janissaries]] are some of the better known positions a slave could hold, but slaves were actually often at the forefront of Ottoman politics. A large percentage of officials in the Ottoman government were bought slaves&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, A. (1980). Chattel slavery in the Ottoman empire. ''Slavery and Abolition'', ''1''(1), 25-45.&lt;/ref&gt; raised free, and integral to the success of the Ottoman Empire from the 14th century into the 19th. Many officials themselves owned a large number of slaves, although the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] himself owned by far the most.&lt;ref name="Dursteler2006" /&gt; By raising and specially training slaves as officials in [[palace school]]s such as [[Enderun]], the Ottomans created administrators with intricate knowledge of government and fanatic loyalty.

== Early Ottoman slavery ==
{{further|Slavery in the Byzantine Empire|History of slavery in the Muslim world}}

In the mid-14th century, [[Murad I]] built an army of slaves, referred to as the ''[[Kapıkulu]]''. The new force was based on the Sultan's right to a fifth of the war booty, which he interpreted to include captives taken in battle. The captive slaves converted to [[Islam]] and trained in the sultan's personal service.&lt;ref&gt;Asaolu, R. O. (2012). ''Slavery''. PediaPress. p14&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Devshirme|devşirme]]'' system could be considered a form of slavery because the Sultans had absolute power over them. However, as the 'servant' or '[[Kul (Ottoman Empire)|kul]]' of the Sultan had high status within Ottoman society, they could become the highest officers of state and the military elite, and all taken children (but not their parents) were well remunerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml#section_4|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Slavery in Islam|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves were traded in special marketplaces called "Esir" or "Yesir" that were located in most towns and cities. It is said that Sultan [[Mehmed II]] "the Conqueror" established the first Ottoman slave market in Constantinople in the 1460s, probably where the former Byzantine slave market had stood. According to [[Nicolas de Nicolay]], there were slaves of all ages and both sexes, they were displayed naked to be thoroughly checked – especially children and young women – by possible buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlir.org/archive/archive/files/bogazici_1978_vol-6_p149-174_95c6548ada.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=11 January 2012|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111084616/http://www.dlir.org/archive/archive/files/bogazici_1978_vol-6_p149-174_95c6548ada.pdf|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Devshirme|devşirme]]'', which connotes "draft", "blood tax" or "child collection", young Christian boys from the [[Balkans]] and [[Anatolia]] were taken from their homes and families, converted to Islam, and enlisted into the most famous branch of the ''Kapıkulu'', the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], a special soldier class of the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] that became a decisive faction in the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasions of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=266205|title=Janissary - Everything2.com|website=www.everything2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the military commanders of the Ottoman forces, imperial administrators, and ''de facto'' rulers of the Empire, such as [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]], were recruited in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html|title=Lewis.

A [[Hutterites|Hutterite]] chronicle reports that in 1605, during the [[Long Turkish War]], some 240 Hutterites were abducted from their homes in [[Upper Hungary]] by the Ottoman Turkish army and their [[Nogais|Tatar]] allies, and sold into Ottoman slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hostetler]]: ''Hutterite Society'', Baltimore 1974, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Waldner]]: ''Das Klein-Geschichtsbuch der Hutterischen Brüder'', Philadelphia, 1947, page 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic slavery was not as common as military slavery.&lt;ref name="coursesa.matrix.msu.edu"/&gt; On the basis of a list of estates belonging to members of the ruling class kept in [[Edirne]] between 1545 and 1659, the following data was collected: out of 93 estates, 41 had slaves.&lt;ref name="coursesa.matrix.msu.edu"/&gt; The total number of slaves in the estates was 140; 54 female and 86 male. 134 of them bore Muslim names, 5 were not defined, and 1 was a Christian woman. Some of these slaves appear to have been employed on farms.&lt;ref name="coursesa.matrix.msu.edu"/&gt; In conclusion, the ruling class, because of extensive use of warrior slaves and because of its own high purchasing capacity, was undoubtedly the single major group keeping the slave market alive in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="coursesa.matrix.msu.edu"/&gt;

Rural slavery was largely a phenomenon endemic to the [[Caucasus]] region, which was carried to Anatolia and Rumelia after the [[Circassians|Circassian]] [[Muhajir (Caucasus)|migration]] in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/|title="Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women—Infanticide in Turkey," New York Daily Times, August 6, 1856|website=chnm.gmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts frequently emerged within the immigrant community and the Ottoman Establishment intervened on the side of the slaves at selective times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circassiancanada.com/tr/arastirma/osmanli_imparatorlugunda_kolelik.htm |title=Osmanlı İmparatorluğu'nda Kölelik |accessdate=2007-10-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221220221/http://www.circassiancanada.com/tr/arastirma/osmanli_imparatorlugunda_kolelik.htm |archivedate=February 21, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crimean Khanate]] maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East until the early eighteenth century. In a series of [[slave raids]] euphemistically known as the "[[Crimean–Nogai raids into East Slavic lands|harvesting of the steppe]]", [[Crimean Tatars]] enslaved [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] peasants. The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Russo-Crimean Wars|Russia]] suffered a series of [[List of Mongol and Tatar attacks in Europe|Tatar invasions]], the goal of which was to loot, pillage, and capture slaves into "''jasyr''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avalanchepress.com/Soldier_Khan.php|title=Avalanche Press|website=www.avalanchepress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borderland area to the south-east was in a state of semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century. It is estimated that up to 75% of the Crimean population consisted of slaves or [[manumission|freed slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157|title=Historical survey &gt; Slave societies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prices and taxes ===
A study of the [[slave market]] of [[Ottoman Crete]] produces details about the prices of slaves. Factors such as age, skin color, [[virginity]] etc. significantly influenced prices. The most expensive slaves were those between 10 and 35 years of age, with the highest prices for European virgin girls 13–25 years of age and teenaged boys. The cheaper slaves were those with disabilities and [[sub-Saharan Africa]]ns. Prices in Crete ranged between 65 and 150 "''esedi guruş''" (see [[Kuruş]]). But even the lowest prices were affordable to only high income persons. For example, in 1717 a 12-year-old boy with mental disabilities was sold for 27 ''guruş'', an amount that could buy in the same year {{convert|462|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} of lamb meat, {{convert|933|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} of bread or {{convert|1,385|l|gal|abbr=on}} of milk. In 1671 a female slave was sold in Crete for 350 ''guruş'', while at the same time the value of a large two-floor house with a garden in [[Chania]] was 300 ''guruş''. There were various taxes to be paid on the importation and selling of slaves. One of them was the "''pençik''" or "''penç-yek''" tax, literally meaning "one fifth". This taxation was based on verses of the [[Quran]], according to which one fifth of the spoils of war belonged to [[God in Islam|God]], to [[Muhammad|the Prophet]] and [[Family tree of Muhammad|his family]], to orphans, to those in need and to travelers. The Ottomans probably started collecting ''pençik'' at the time of Sultan [[Murad I]] (1362–1389). ''Pençik'' was collected both in money and in kind, the latter including slaves as well. Tax was not collected in some cases of war captives. With war captives, slaves were given to soldiers and officers as a motive to participate in war.&lt;ref name="Spyropoulos"/&gt;

The recapture of runaway slaves was a job for private individuals called "''yavacis''". Whoever managed to find a runaway slave would collect a fee of "good news" from the ''yavaci'' and the latter took this fee plus other expenses from the slaves' owner. Slaves could also be rented, inherited, [[Pawnbroker|pawned]], exchanged or given as gifts.&lt;ref name="Spyropoulos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For slaves offered as gifts to the sultan and other high-rank officials, see  Reindl-Kiel, Hedda.

== Barbary slave raids ==
{{see|Barbary corsairs|Barbary slave trade}}

For centuries, large vessels on the Mediterranean relied on European [[galley slaves]] supplied by Ottoman and [[Barbary slave trade]]rs. Hundreds of thousands of Europeans were captured by [[Barbary corsairs|Barbary pirates]] and sold as slaves in [[North Africa]] and the Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm ''When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220038/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - British History in depth: British Slaves on the Barbary Coast|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These slave raids were conducted largely by [[Arabs]] and [[Berber people|Berbers]] rather than Ottoman Turks. However, during the height of the Barbary slave trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Barbary states were subject to Ottoman [[jurisdiction]] and were ruled by Ottoman [[pasha]]s. Furthermore, many slaves captured by the Barbary corsairs were sold eastward into Ottoman territories before, during, and after Barbary's period of Ottoman rule.&lt;ref&gt;Milton, G. (2005).

== Zanj slaves ==
{{Main|Zanj|Arab slave trade}}

As there were restrictions on the enslavement of Muslims and "[[People of the Book]]" (Jews and Christians), pagan areas in Africa were a popular source of slaves. Known as the [[Zanj]] ([[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]&lt;ref name="Tlosfea"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khalid|first1=Abdallah|title=The Liberation of Swahili from European Appropriation|date=1977|publisher=East African Literature Bureau|page=38|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=M4QOAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), these slaves were mainly drawn from the [[African Great Lakes]] region as well as [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref name="Ftadttb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tinker|first=Keith L.|title=The African Diaspora to the Bahamas: The Story of the Migration of People of African Descent to the Bahamas|date=2012|publisher=FriesenPress|isbn=978-1460205549|page=9|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=nvF-xJQsUrgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zanj were employed in households, on plantations and in the army as slave-soldiers.

One of the only ways for Zanj slaves to serve in high ranking roles was to be one of the African [[Eunuch|eunuchs]] of the Ottoman palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East: An Historical Enquiry|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0195053265|location=New York, New York|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position was used as a political tool by Sultan [[Murad III]] as an attempt to destabilize the Grand Vizier by introducing another source of power to the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire|last=Tezcan|first=Baki|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0521520850|editor-last=Aksan|editor-first=Virginia|location=Cambridge|pages=177|chapter=Politics of early modern Ottoman historiography|editor-last2=Goffman|editor-first2=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being purchased by a member of the [[Ottoman court]], Mullah Ali was introduced to the first chief Black eunuch, Mehmed Aga.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to Mehmed Aga’s influence, Mullah Ali was able to make connections with prominent colleges and tutors of the day, including [[Hoca Sadeddin Efendi]], the tutor of Murad III.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Second Ottoman Empire: Political and Social Transformation in the Early Modern World|last=Tezcan|first=Baki|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521519496|location=Cambridge|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the network he had built with the help of his education and the black eunuchs, Mullah Ali secured several positions early on.

Although Mullah Ali was often challenged because of his blackness and his connection to the African eunuchs, he was able to defend himself through his powerful network of support and his own intellectual productions. As a prominent scholar, he wrote an influential book in which he used logic and the [[Quran]] to debunk stereotypes and prejudice against dark-skinned people and delegitimize arguments for why Africans should be slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought|last=|first=|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Bowering|editor-first=Gerhard|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=455|chapter=Racism|editor-last2=Crone|editor-first2=Patricia|editor-last3=Kadi|editor-first3=Wadad|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=q1I0pcrFFSUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Slaves in the Imperial Harem ==
[[File:Jean-Baptiste van Mour 010.jpg|thumb|200px|An 18th-century painting of the harem of Sultan [[Ahmed III]], by [[Jean Baptiste Vanmour]].]]
The [[Imperial Harem|concubines of the Ottoman Sultan]] consisted chiefly of purchased slaves. The Sultan's concubines were generally of Christian origin. The mother of a Sultan, though technically a slave, received the extremely powerful title of ''[[Valide Sultan]]'' which raised her to the status of a ruler of the Empire (see [[Sultanate of Women]]). One notable example was [[Kösem Sultan]], daughter of a Greek Christian priest, who dominated the Ottoman Empire during the early decades of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Jay Winik (2007), ''The Great Upheaval''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roxelana]] (also known as ''Hürrem Sultan''), another notable example, was the favorite wife of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iudergi.com/tr/index.php/tarih/article/download/3733/3385 Ayşe Özakbaş, Hürrem Sultan, Tarih Dergisi, Sayı 36, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113000232/http://www.iudergi.com/tr/index.php/tarih/article/download/3733/3385 |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inspecting New Arrivals by Giulio Rosati 2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Giulio Rosati]], ''Inspection of New Arrivals'', 1858–1917, [[Circassian beauties]].]]
The concubines were guarded by enslaved [[eunuchs]], themselves often from pagan Africa. The eunuchs were headed by the [[Kizlar Agha]] ("[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]] of the [slave] girls"). While Islamic law forbade the emasculation of a man, Ethiopian Christians had no such compunctions; thus, they enslaved and emasculated members of territories to the south and sold the resulting eunuchs to the [[Sublime Porte|Ottoman Porte]].&lt;ref name="Gcam"&gt;Gwyn Campbell, ''The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia'', 1 edition, (Routledge: 2003), p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Winik, ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]] participated extensively in the slave trade of eunuchs. Coptic priests sliced the penis and testicles off boys around the age of eight in a [[castration]] operation.&lt;ref name="AJUS-1919"/&gt;

The eunuch boys were then sold in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The majority of Ottoman eunuchs endured castration at the hands of the Copts at Abou Gerbe monastery on Mount Ghebel Eter.&lt;ref name="AJUS-1919"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mz1YAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA522&amp;dq=coptic+castrate+abyssinian#v=onepage&amp;q=coptic%20castrate%20abyssinian&amp;f=false|title=The American Journal of Urology and Sexology, Volume 15|author=Henry G.

== Sexual slavery ==
[[File:Kuchek Hanem - 19th century dancer 01.jpg|thumb|200px|A 19th-century photograph of a [[Köçek]], a cross-dressing young slave boy sometimes used for homosexual purposes.]]
[[Circassians]], [[Syrian people|Syrians]], and [[Nubians]] were the three primary races of females who were sold as sex slaves in the Ottoman Empire. Circassian girls were described as fair and light-skinned and were frequently enslaved by [[Crimean Tatars]] then sold to Ottomans. They were the most expensive, reaching up to 500 [[pounds sterling]] and the most popular with the Turks. Second in popularity were Syrian girls, with their dark eyes, dark hair, and light brown skin, and came largely from coastal regions in [[Anatolia]]. Their price could reach up to 30 pounds sterling. They were described as having "good figures when young". Nubian girls were the cheapest and least popular, fetching up to 20 pounds sterling.&lt;ref name="Schierbrand1886"/&gt;

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, [[sexual slavery]] was not only central to Ottoman practice but a critical component of imperial governance and elite social reproduction.&lt;ref name="Zilfi2010"/&gt; [[Dhimmi]] boys taken in the ''devşirme'' could also become sexual slaves, though usually they worked in places like bathhouses ([[Turkish bath|hammam]]) and coffeehouses. They became ''[[tellak]]s'' (masseurs), ''[[köçek]]s'' (cross-dressing dancers) or ''sāqīs'' (wine pourers) for as long as they were young and beardless.&lt;ref&gt;Madeline C. Zilfi ''Women and slavery in the late Ottoman Empire'' Cambridge University Press, 2010 p74-75, 115, 186-188, 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decline and suppression of Ottoman slavery ==
Responding  the influence and pressure of European countries in the 19th century, the Empire began taking steps to curtail the [[slave trade]], which had been legally valid under Ottoman law since the beginning of the empire. One of the important campaigns against Ottoman slavery and slave trade was conducted in the Caucasus by the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;L.Kurtynova-d'Herlugnan, The Tsar's Abolitionists, Leiden, Brill, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of decrees were promulgated that initially limited the slavery of white persons, and subsequently that of all races and religions. In 1830, a ''[[firman]]'' of Sultan [[Mahmud II]] gave freedom to white slaves. This category included Circassians, who had the custom of selling their own children, enslaved Greeks who had revolted against the Empire in 1821, and some others.&lt;ref name="George Young"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/corpsdedroitott03turkgoog|title=Corps de droit ottoman: recueil des codes, lois, règlements, ordonnances et …|first=Turkey|last=George Young|date=27 October 2017|publisher=The Clarendon Press|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempting to suppress the practice, another ''firman'' abolishing the trade of [[Georgians]] and Circassians was issued in October, 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Badem, C. (2017). ''The Ottoman Crimean War (1853-1856)''. Brill. p353-356&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later, slave trafficking was prohibited in practice by enforcing specific conditions of slavery in ''[[sharia]]'', Islamic law, even though sharia permitted slavery in principle. For example, under one provision, a person who was captured could not be kept a slave if they had already been Muslim prior to their capture. Moreover, they could not be captured legitimately without a formal declaration of war, and only the Sultan could make such a declaration. As late Ottoman Sultans wished to halt slavery, they did not authorize raids for the purpose of capturing slaves, and thereby made it effectively illegal to procure new slaves, although those already in slavery remained slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fputn%2Fputn0005%2F&amp;tif=00623.TIF&amp;cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABK9283-0005-235 "Slavery in the Ottoman Empire"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the seminal writing on the subject by Egyptian Ottoman Ahmad Shafiq Pasha, who wrote the highly influential book "L'Esclavage au Point de vue Musulman." ("Slavery from a Muslim Perspective").&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Empire and 16 other countries signed the 1890 [[Brussels Conference Act of 1890|Brussels Conference Act]] for the suppression of the slave trade. Clandestine slavery persisted into the early 20th century. A circular by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in October 1895 warned local authorities that some [[steamships]] stripped Zanj sailors of their "certificates of liberation" and threw them into slavery. Another circular of the same year reveals that some newly freed Zanj slaves were arrested based on unfounded accusations, imprisoned and forced back to their lords.&lt;ref name="George Young"/&gt;

An instruction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the [[Vali (governor)#Ottoman Empire term|Vali]] of [[Basra|Bassora]] of 1897 ordered that the children of liberated slaves be issued separate certificates of liberation to avoid both being enslaved themselves and separated from their parents. George Young, Second Secretary of the [[Foreign relations of the Ottoman Empire|British Embassy in Constantinople]], wrote in his ''Corpus of Ottoman Law'', published in 1905, that at time of writing the slave trade in the Empire was practiced only as contraband.&lt;ref name="George Young"/&gt; The trade continued until [[World War I]]. [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]], who served as the U.S. Ambassador in Constantinople from 1913 until 1916, reported in his ''[[Ambassador Morgenthau's Story]]'' that there were gangs that traded white slaves during those years.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenthau Henry (1918) Ambassador Morgenthau's Story, Garden City, N.Y, Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., chapter 8.

'''''The Bridge at Narni''''' (in French: ''Le pont de Narni'') is an 1826 painting of the [[Ponte d'Augusto (Narni)|Ponte d'Augusto]] at [[Narni]] by [[France|French]] artist [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]]. The painting is currently on display at the [[Musée du Louvre]] in [[Paris]]. 

The painting is a product of one of Corot's youthful sojourns in Italy, and, in [[Kenneth Clark]]'s words, "as free as the most vigorous [[John Constable|Constable]]". It was painted in September 1826, and was the basis for the larger and more finished ''View at Narni'', which was exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1827, and is now in the [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]].

The view was not a novel one: in 1821 Corot's teacher, [[Achille-Etna Michallon]] had drawn the same scene, as had Corot's friend Ernst Fries in 1826. Corot's study is a reconciliation of traditional and [[plein air]] painting objectives:

''So deeply did Corot admire [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] and [[Nicholas Poussin|Poussin]], so fully did he understand their work, that from the outset he viewed nature in their terms....In less than a year (since his arrival in Rome) he had realized his goal of closing the gap between the empirical freshness of outdoor painting and the organizing principles of classical landscape composition.''&lt;ref&gt;Galassi, Peter, ''Corot in Italy'', page 168-70. Yale University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 1208''', adopted unanimously on 19 November 1998, after recalling [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1170|Resolution 1170]] (1998) on Africa, the Council discussed the treatment and status of [[refugee]]s on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Security Council, acting on Secretary-General's Africa report, adopts texts of status and treatment of refugees, illicit arms flow|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1998/19981119.sc6598.html|date=19 November 1998|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was important that refugees were protected and that the humanitarian character of refugee camps preserved.&lt;ref name=fh&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=H.|title=Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law: 1999, Volume 2; Volume 1999|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-90-6704-119-5|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council recognised the experience African countries had in dealing with refugees and refugee camps. There was insecurity in some camps due to the presence of armed groups which did not qualify for international protection, differences within the refugee population, crime, [[outlaw|banditry]], and the flow of [[weapon]]s. It emphasised the need to assist African countries to provide security for refugees, maintain the humanitarian character of refugee camps and protect vulnerable groups such as women, children and the elderly.

The Security Council stressed the importance of the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] of 1951 and of particular relevance was the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) [[Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa]]. The host of a refugee camp was responsible for its security and humanitarian nature. In this regard, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], OAU, the [[international community]] and regional and subregional organisations were urged to assist African countries hosting refugee populations while the Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] had to respond to requests concerning the implementation of human rights and [[international humanitarian law]].&lt;ref name=fh/&gt; Finally, he was also asked to consider the establishment of a new category within the United Nations Trust Fund for Improving Preparedness for Conflict Prevention and Peacekeeping in Africa.

Various islands in the [[Caribbean]] that were [[British overseas territories|colonies of the United Kingdom]], including [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], and those on the [[British Leeward Islands|Leeward]] and [[British Windward Islands|Windward Islands]], came together to form the Federation, with its capital in [[Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago]]. The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would [[decolonization|become independent]] from Britain as a single state—possibly similar to the [[Canadian Confederation]], [[Federation of Australia|Australian Commonwealth]], or [[Central African Federation]]; however, before that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how the Federation itself would be governed or how it would viably function. The territories that would have become part of the Federation eventually became the nine contemporary [[sovereign states]] of [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Barbados]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]; with [[Anguilla]], [[Montserrat]], the [[Cayman Islands]], and [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] becoming [[British overseas territories]]. British Guiana (Guyana) and British Honduras (Belize) held [[observer status]] within the West Indies Federation.

==Population and geography==
The total population of the West Indies Federation was between 3 and 4 million people, with the majority being of black West African descent. Minorities included [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]] from the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] (called East Indians), [[Europe]]ans, Chinese, and [[Island Caribs|Caribs]]. There was also a large population of mixed descent (mainly [[mulatto]]s, but also Afro-Indian, Euro-Indian and mixed-Chinese). In terms of religion, most of the population was Protestant, with significant numbers of Catholics and some Hindus and Muslims (both almost exclusively from the East Indian population).

The West Indies Federation (or just West Indies) consisted of around 24 main inhabited islands and approximately 220–230 minor offshore islands, islets and cays (some inhabited, some uninhabited). The largest island was [[Jamaica]], located in the far northwest of the Federation. To the southeast lay the second largest island, [[Trinidad]], followed by [[Barbados]] (in terms of population), located at the eastern extremity of the Federation.

The Federation spanned all the island groupings in the [[Caribbean]]:
*The [[Greater Antilles]]: [[Jamaica]] and the [[Cayman Islands]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]
*The [[Lesser Antilles]]:
**[[Barbados]], east of the Windward Islands
**[[Leeward Islands]]: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]], and [[Montserrat]]
**[[Windward Islands]]: [[Dominica]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Grenada]]
**[[Trinidad and Tobago]]

At its widest (west to east), from the Cayman Islands to Barbados it spanned some {{convert|2425|km|nmi|-1}} (and across approximately 22 degrees of longitude) and from the Turks and Caicos Islands in the north, to the [[Icacos Point]], Trinidad in the south it extended {{convert|1700|km|nmi|-1}} (and across 12 degrees of latitude). However, most of the area along either of these distances was taken up by open water (with the exception of some of the other islands lying in between). By comparison [[Great Britain]] stretches across nearly 10 degrees of latitude and [[Spain]] extends across almost 20 degrees of longitude. Even though the West Indies was spread across such a vast area, most of its provinces were mostly contiguous and clustered fairly close together in the Eastern Caribbean, with the obvious exceptions of Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and Turks and Caicos Islands.

Most of the islands have mountainous interiors surrounded by narrow coastal plains. The exceptions were [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua]], [[Barbuda]], the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands (which are all fairly flat), and Trinidad (which has a large mountain range in the north and a small central mountain range in the interior of the otherwise flat island). The narrow coastal plains as well as historical trade is the main reason why almost all of the major settlements (cities and towns) of the Federation were located on the coast. Chief towns included [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Port of Spain]], [[Bridgetown]], [[Spanish Town]], [[Montego Bay]], [[Mandeville, Jamaica|Mandeville]], [[Castries]], [[Roseau]], [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], [[Kingstown]], [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda|St. John's]], and [[Basseterre]].

The climate in all the islands is tropical, with hot and humid weather, although inland regions in the larger islands have more temperate climates. Regions falling within the [[rain shadow]]s (southern coasts of Jamaica and Trinidad and eastern coasts of the Lesser Antilles) are relatively drier. There are two seasons annually: the dry season for the first six months of the year, and the rainy season (also known as the hurricane season) in the second half of the year. Many of the islands fall within the traditional [[hurricane belt]], with the exception of Trinidad (although it occasionally experiences low latitude hurricanes) and thus are at risk from potential wind and flood damage.

Britain classified the Federation as being part of its "Caribbean and North Atlantic Territories" region which was shared alongside other possessions such as [[Bermuda]].

The Federation today is geographically considered to be part of the [[North America]]n continent as all of its islands are in and around the Caribbean, even though Trinidad is located just offshore from [[South America]] and lies on the same continental shelf.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Eustace Williams, [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00087323/00001 "A new federation for the Commonwealth Caribbean?"], ''PNM Pub.

Historically "West Indian" nations [[Bahamas|The Bahamas]], [[Bermuda]], [[Belize]], the [[British Virgin Islands]], and [[Guyana]] opted not to join because they believed that their future lay with association with [[North America]] (for both the Bahamas and Bermuda), [[Central America]], and the [[United States Virgin Islands]]. Guyana opted not to join at that time due to its ongoing political and internal struggles for independence from the UK, started in the 1950s. At issue were the newly formed political party with socialist leanings, at the height of the cold war. It had hoped to join the federation once the issues were resolved. The Bahamas did participate in the 1960 [[West Indies Federation Games]], with a future prime minister of the Bahamas, [[Perry Christie]], as an athlete. There was however possible interest by Guyana in a very loose re-attempted Caribbean Federation around 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1971/nov/17/proposed-caribbean-federation#S5LV0325P0_19711117_HOL_8 The Parliament of the United Kingdom c/o Hansard system: Proposed Caribbean Federation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and legal status==
[[File:St. Vincent 3c West Indies Federation stamp 1958.jpg|thumb|A 1958 St. Vincent stamp to mark the establishment of the West Indies Federation]]
The Federation was an internally [[Self-governing colony|self-governing]], [[Federation|federal]] state made up of ten provinces, all [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial possessions. The federation was created by the [[United Kingdom]] in 1958 from most of the [[British West Indies]]. Britain intended that the Federation would shortly become a fully independent state, thus simultaneously satisfying the demands for [[independence]] from all the colonies in the region. However, the project was doomed by political squabbling among the provinces, and the Federation never achieved full [[sovereignty]].

The legal basis for the federation was the [[British Caribbean Federation Act 1956]], and the date of formation—January 3, 1958—was set by an [[Order in Council]] proclaimed in 1957.

As with all British colonies of the period, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] was the [[head of state]], and [[The Crown]] was vested with the legislative authority for matters concerning executive affairs, defence and the financing of the Federation. Her representative, [[Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, 1st Baron Hailes]], was given the title of [[Governor-General]] rather than that of [[Governor]] more typical for a British colony. The title may have reflected the federal nature of the state, or indicated the expectations that the Federation would soon become independent. The Governor-General also had the full power by the [[British Government]] to veto any laws passed by the Federation.

The Federal Parliament was [[bicameral]], consisting of a nominated [[Senate]] and a popularly elected [[House of Representatives]]. The Senate consisted of nineteen members. These members were appointed by the Governor General, after consulting the respective territorial governments. Two members represented each unit (with only one from Montserrat). The House of Representatives had 45 total elected members – Jamaica had seventeen seats, Trinidad and Tobago ten seats, Barbados five seats, Montserrat one seat, and the remaining islands two seats each.

However the government (executive) would be a Council of State, not a Cabinet. It would be presided over by the Governor-General and consist of the Prime Minister and ten other officials.

==Federal Supreme Court==
There was also a Federal Supreme Court consisting of a Chief Justice and three (later five) other Justices. The Federal Supreme Court itself was the successor&lt;ref&gt;[http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00076857/00001/6j British Caribbean Federation Act, 1956 Sec.1 p.4]&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[West Indian Court of Appeal]] (established in 1919)&lt;ref name = "West Indian Court of Appeal, 1919"&gt;[http://webopac.ttlawcourts.org/LibraryJud/library/acq/TTAct1919.pdf West Indian Court of Appeal Act, 1919]&lt;/ref&gt; and had jurisdiction over the same territories (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands (including the British Virgin Islands), Trinidad &amp; Tobago and the Windward Islands)&lt;ref name = "West Indian Court of Appeal, 1919" /&gt; in addition to Jamaica and its dependencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00076857/00001/7j British Caribbean Federation Act, 1956 Sec. 1 p.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 1956 British Caribbean Federation Act though, the Federal Supreme Court did not have any jurisdiction over British Honduras, as the [[British Honduras (Court of Appeal) Act, 1881]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=pCX660FA5wMC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=british+honduras+court+of+appeal+act+1881&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RFY0kYJQ6J&amp;sig=dhNiFziumGQvXMU4VOgbw5x6gok&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OAGtTqyRGcjFgAebr8noDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20honduras%20court%20of%20appeal%20act%201881&amp;f=false The common law abroad: constitutional and legal legacy of the British empire By Jerry Dupont p.227]&lt;/ref&gt; (which allowed for appeals from the British Honduras Supreme Court to go the Privy Council or the Supreme Court of Jamaica) was repealed&lt;ref&gt;[http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00076857/00001/9j British Caribbean Federation Act, 1956 Sec. 5 p.7]&lt;/ref&gt; under it (although the arrangement for appeals to the Supreme Court of Jamaica had generally ceased in 1911 anyway).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicaphilately.info/10_Environment-People/109_Publications/Handbook-of-Jamaica/Handbook-of-Jamaica-1927.pdf Handbook Of Jamaica, 1927 By Frank Cundall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425122223/http://www.jamaicaphilately.info/10_Environment-People/109_Publications/Handbook-of-Jamaica/Handbook-of-Jamaica-1927.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.jm/books?ei=2ACtTr7UBMTYgQfw5PzEDw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=G0WHAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=british+honduras+order+in+council+3+aug+1911&amp;q=1911#search_anchor Government of the West Indies (1923) by Humphrey Hume Wrong p. 160]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Stanley Eugene Gomes]], [[Chief Justice of Trinidad and Tobago]], was appointed [[Chief Justice]] of the Federation in August, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00076857/00209| title=The West Indies Gazette, Vol 4, No 34|publisher=Governor General |accessdate= 28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed and ''de facto'' capital==
Three member states were proposed as hosts for the [[Capital (political)|capital]] city of the federation: Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. Earlier in the federal negotiations the general opinion had been that the capital should be one of the smaller islands so that the capital would be in a neutral position to the larger territories and it would be able to inject some buoyancy into one of the (then) poorer economies. To this end, Grenada was "tentatively" selected as the member state to host the capital but this was abandoned after protests from some of the parties involved, and at the London Conference the smaller islands were ruled out for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trinicenter.com/kwame/2010/1505.htm |title=W.I.

==Elections==
{{main|West Indies federal elections, 1958}}
[[File:West Indies Federal elections, 1958 (largest party by island).svg|thumb|Map of the results of the 1958 Federal election. The WIFLP won the most seats in islands/island groups coloured orange, whilst the DLP won the most seats in islands/island groups coloured blue. The [[Cayman Islands]] &amp; [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] were included as part of Jamaica.]]
In preparation for the first federal elections, two Federation-wide parties were organised as confederations of local political parties. Both were organised by Jamaican politicians: the [[West Indies Federal Labour Party]] by [[Norman Manley]], and the [[Democratic Labour Party (West Indies Federation)|Democratic Labour Party]] by [[Alexander Bustamante]]. In broad terms, the WIFLP consisted of the urban-based parties throughout the Federation, while the DLP consisted of the rural-based parties. A small third party, the [[Federal Democratic Party]] was founded in November 1957 by a group of Trinidadians, although it did not win any seats.

The platforms for the two major national parties were similar in many respects. Both advocated maintaining and strengthening ties with the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada (countries with which the islands had strong cultural and economic links); encouraging and expanding tourism; working to bring British Guiana and British Honduras into the Federation and to obtain loans, financial aid, and technical assistance. Despite these similarities, there were differences. The WIFLP had advocated the encouragement of agriculture while the DLP had promised a climate favourable to both private industry and labour, development of human and economic resources. The WIFLP promised to encourage the Bahamas (in addition to British Guiana and British Honduras) to join the Federation, whereas the DLP did not. The WIFLP also campaigned to establish a central bank for the extension of credit resources and advocated a democratic socialist society and full internal self-government for all the unit territories, whilst avoiding the issues of freedom of movement and a customs union. The DLP said nothing about full internal self-government, attacked socialism, wished to avoid high taxation (via loans and technical aid) and emphasized West Indian unity, freedom of worship and speech, and encouragement of trade unions.

[[West Indies federal elections, 1958|Federal elections]] were held on March 25, 1958. The WIFLP won the election, winning 26 seats while the DLP carried 19 seats. The bulk of the WIFLP seats came from the smaller islands while the DLP carried the majority in Jamaica and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. The DLP won 11 of the Jamaican seats and 6 of the Trinidadian seats. In appointing the Senate, Governor General [[Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, 1st Baron Hailes|Lord Hailes]] realized that only the St Vincent island government was DLP controlled and as a result the Senate was going to be disproportionately pro WIFLP. In a controversial decision, he contacted the opposition DLP groups in Jamaica and Trinidad, and appointed one DLP senator from each of those islands. Thus the Senate consisted of a total of 15 WIFLP members and 4 DLP members.

WIFLP leader Sir [[Grantley Adams]] of Barbados became [[Prime Minister of the West Indies Federation|Prime Minister]]. The selection of Adams as the Prime Minister was indicative of the problems the Federation would face. The expected leader of the WIFLP was Norman Manley, Premier of Jamaica, and the next logical choice was Dr. [[Eric Williams]], Premier of Trinidad and Tobago. However, neither had contested the Federal elections, preferring to remain in control of their respective island power bases. This suggested that the leaders of the two most important provinces did not see the Federation as viable. Similarly, Alexander Bustamante, the Jamaican founder of the DLP, also declined to contest the Federal election, leaving the party leadership to the Trinidadian [[Ashford Sinanan]]. The absence of the leading Jamaican politicians from any role at the federal level was to undermine the Federation's unity.

Other members of the Council of State included:
*Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade and Industry: The Hon. Dr. [[C.G.D. La Corbiniere]]
*Minister of Finance: The Hon. [[Robert Bradshaw (politician)|Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw]] ([[St. Kitts]])
*Minister of Communications and Works: The Hon. [[W. A. Rose]]
*Minister of Natural Resources and Agriculture: The Hon. [[F.B. Ricketts]]
*Minister of Labour and Social Affairs: The Hon. Mrs. [[Phyllis Byam Shand Allfrey]] ([[Dominica]])
*Ministers without Portfolio: The Hon. [[N.H. Richards]], The Hon. Mr. [[V.B Vaughn]], Senator [[A.G.R. Byfield]] ([[Jamaica]]), Senator [[J.W. Liburd]], and Senator [[J.L. Charles]]

==Government services==
The Federation also had a number of units deemed to be common services for the entire federation, these were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1962/mar/15/west-indies-bill-hl-1#S5LV0238P0_19620315_HOL_134 WEST INDIES BILL [H.L.&amp;#93;, HL Deb 15 March 1962 vol 238 cc340-64]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Federal Shipping Service
*The Federal Supreme Court
*[[University of the West Indies|The University College of the West Indies]]
*[[Caribbean Meteorological Organisation|The West Indies Meteorological Service]]
*[[West India Regiment|The West India Regiment]]

==Federal problems==
The politics of the embryonic Federation were wrecked by struggles between the federal government and the provincial governments, and between the two largest provinces (Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago) and the smaller provinces.

The West Indies Federation had an unusually weak federal structure. For instance, its provinces were not contained in a single [[customs union]]. Thus, each province functioned as a separate economy, complete with tariffs, largely because the smaller provinces were afraid of being overwhelmed by the large islands' economies. Also, complete freedom of movement within the Federation was not implemented, as the larger provinces were worried about mass migration from the smaller islands. In this sense, the current [[European Union]] can be said to have implemented a more unified economic space than the West Indian attempt.

Nor could the federal government take its component states to task. The initial federal budget was quite small, limiting the federal government's ability to use its financial largesse as a [[Carrot and stick|carrot]]. It was dependent upon grants from the United Kingdom and from its member states. The provincial budgets of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago were both larger than the federal budget. This led to repeated requests for those states to provide greater financing to the federal government. These requests were not well received, as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago together already contributed 85 percent of the federal revenue, in roughly equal portions.

Furthermore, the office of the Prime Minister was a weak one. Unlike other Westminster systems with Prime Ministers, the West Indian Federation's PM could not dissolve Parliament.

==Relationship with Canada==
{{Main|Canada–Caribbean relations}}

The Federation maintained a particularly close relationship with [[Canada]], which had a similar past in that it was a [[Canadian Confederation|federation]] of several former British colonies. In the early years, several Caribbean leaders suggested that the West Indies Federation should investigate the possibility of [[Provincial creationism|becoming a Canadian province]], though this was never more than a fleeting interest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Despite the breakdown in talks, in May 1961, [[Canada]] presented the West Indies Federation with two of the region's most important gifts: two [[merchant ship]]s, named ''The Federal Palm'' and ''The Federal Maple''. These two vessels visited every island in the federation twice monthly, providing a crucial sea-link between the islands.

==Dissolution==
Many reasons have been put forward to explain the demise of the federation. These include the lack of local popular support, competing insular [[nationalism]], the weakness of the federal government, prohibitions on federal taxation and freedom of movement, inadequacies in the Federal [[constitution]], fundamental changes made to the constitution very early in its existence, political feuds between the influential leaders, the decision of the three most influential politicians not to contest Federal elections, friction between these leaders and the Federal government, the overwhelming concentration of population and resources in the two largest units, geographic and cultural distance between the units, the lack of a history of common administration, and the impact of the period of [[Self-governing colony|self-government]] that followed the promotion from [[British overseas territory|Crown Colony]] system.

However, the immediate catalyst for the dissolution of the Federation was Jamaican discontent. By 1961, there were a number of reasons for Jamaica's dissatisfaction with the state of affairs:
*Jamaica was fairly remote from most of the other islands in the Federation, lying several hundred miles to the west.
*Jamaica's share of the seats in the federal parliament was smaller than its share of the total population of the Federation.
*It was believed that the smaller islands were draining Jamaica's wealth.
*Many in Jamaica were upset that Kingston had not been chosen as the federal capital.

The most important reason for Jamaican dissatisfaction was the Federation's continuing colonial status. Jamaica had joined the Federation because its leaders had believed that the West Indies would quickly be granted independence. Nearly three years after the formation of the Federation, this had not occurred; meanwhile, smaller British colonies, like [[Cyprus]] and [[Sierra Leone]], had gained independence. Thus, many Jamaicans believed that the island could and should seek independence in its own right.

There were also problems with the Federation's proposed capital in [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]], at that time still in the hands of the United States (having leased it as a naval base from the United Kingdom during World War 2). Many of the Caribbean provincial leaders wanted Chaguaramas to be the Federation's capital. Provincial leaders such as Norman Manley of Jamaica and Eric Williams pushed for handing over of Chaguramas to the Federation from the US. However the US and the UK disagreed and the Federation's Prime Minister Grantley Adams stopped the provincial leaders from obtaining Chaguramas. For many Jamaicans it appeared that the Federation would then just hamper their development and movement towards independence.

As a result, the [[Alexander Bustamante|Bustamante]]-led [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (the local component of the West Indian DLP) successfully forced Manley to hold a [[Jamaican Federation of the West Indies membership referendum, 1961|referendum]] in September 1961 on political [[secession]] from the Federation. It passed, with 54% of the vote, despite the opposition of Manley, the province's Chief Minister at the time. Manley himself lost the subsequent island elections in April 1962, and Bustamante became the first [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|Prime Minister]] of an independent Jamaica on 6 August 1962.

After Jamaica left, there was an attempt to salvage a new federation from the wreckage of the old. Much depended on Premier Williams of Trinidad and Tobago, who had stated previously that he wanted a "strong federation". Premier [[Vere Bird]] of Antigua responded that his province would only be in a federation with Trinidad as an equal partner, not as "a little Tobago". He did indicate that a strong federation was acceptable provided that no attempt was made to create a unitary state.

Negotiations on this new federation began in September 1961; however, they indicated that Trinidad would have to provide 75 to 80 percent of the new Federation's revenue. Also, even though Trinidad would now represent 60 percent of the new Federation's population, the proposals under consideration would give it less than half of the seats in parliament.

By November, Williams indicated that he was now in favour of the idea of a unitary state. Failing that, he resolved to take Trinidad and Tobago into independence. In this, he was buoyed by his re-election as Trinidadian leader on December 4, 1961. Later that December, Premier [[Errol Barrow]] of Barbados met with Williams, but failed to persuade him to keep Trinidad in the Federation.

On January 14, 1962, the [[People's National Movement]] (the Williams-led Trinidad component of the WIFLP) passed a resolution rejecting any further involvement with the Federation. Williams himself stated that "one from ten leaves nought"—in other words, without Jamaica, no Federation was possible. Trinidad and Tobago became independent on August 31, 1962.

Without Trinidad and Jamaica, the remaining "Little Eight" attempted to salvage some form of a West Indian Federation, this time centred on Barbados. However, these negotiations ultimately proved fruitless. Without its two largest states, the Federation was doomed to financial insolvency. Barbados now refused to shoulder the financial burden, and Antigua and Grenada began toying with the idea of merging with Jamaica and Trinidad, respectively.

The West Indies Federation was legally dissolved with the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]'s [[West Indies Act 1962]]. The remaining "Little Eight" provinces once again became separate colonies supervised directly from London, most of which became independent later on, as follows:
*[[Barbados]] – 1966
*[[Grenada]] – 1974
*[[Dominica]] – 1978
*[[Saint Lucia]] – 1979
*[[St Vincent and the Grenadines]] – 1979
*[[Antigua and Barbuda]] – 1981
*[[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] – 1983

[[Montserrat]] remains an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. The [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] had been separated from Jamaica upon the latter's independence in 1962; [[Anguilla]] was separated from Saint Kitts and Nevis in 1980. All three remain UK territories as well.

==Legacy==
The federation's currency was the [[West Indies dollar]] (though Jamaica continued to use the pound), which was later succeeded by the [[East Caribbean dollar]], the [[Barbadian dollar]], and the [[Trinidad and Tobago dollar]]. Successor organisations included the [[West Indies Associated States]] and [[CARICOM]].

The Federal Supreme Court would also be succeed by a British Caribbean Court of Appeal (1962–1966) and then a West Indies Associated States Supreme Court (Court of Appeal and High Court) (1967–1980) and ultimately by an Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal and [[Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court]] in 1981 for the [[OECS]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pCX660FA5wMC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=west+indian+court+of+appeal+jamaica&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Gk1wTZqqCYrVgQem0vk8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20indian%20court%20of%20appeal%20jamaica&amp;f=false The common law abroad: constitutional and legal legacy of the British empire By Jerry Dupont p.153]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carilaw.cavehill.uwi.edu/default.aspx CariLaw]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently a [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] has been established which would also fulfill the role of the original Supreme Court if all [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy|CSME]] members accede to the court's appellate jurisdiction (currently Barbados, Belize and Guyana do so).

Some see the [[West Indies cricket team]] as a legacy of the Federation, although the side was actually organised thirty years prior to the birth of the federation.

Another lasting regional fixture, officially created before the Federation, is the [[University of the West Indies]]. During the Federation, the University pursued a policy of regional expansion beyond the main Jamaica campus. Two other campuses were established: one in Trinidad and Tobago, established in 1960, and one in Barbados, established a short time after the Federation dissolved in 1963. Since 2004, the [[West Indies Federal Archives Centre]] has been located on the University's [[Cave Hill, Saint Michael, Barbados|Cave Hill]] campus in Barbados.

During the Federation's existence, each member continued to issue its own [[postage stamp]]s as before; but on April 22, 1958, each of the members (except for the Cayman Islands) issued a set of three [[commemorative stamp]]s. All of these stamps used a common design depicting a map of the Caribbean and a portrait of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], with an inscription reading &lt;small&gt;"'''THE WEST INDIES / FEDERATION 1958'''"&lt;/small&gt; at the top and the name of the member state at the bottom. These stamps are quite common in both mint and used condition.

==Prior attempts at federation==
The Federation of the West Indies was not the first attempt at a British Caribbean federation (nor would it be the last). The history of the previous attempts at federations and unions, in part, explains the failure of the 1958 Federation.

The initial federal attempts never went so far as to try to encompass all of the [[British West Indies]] (BWI), but were more regional in scope. The historical regional groupings included the [[British Leeward Islands]], [[British Windward Islands]] and Jamaica with nearby colonies. See [[History of the British West Indies]].
