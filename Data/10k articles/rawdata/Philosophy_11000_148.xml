'''Abu al-Qasim Mahmud ibn Umar al-Zamakhshari''', known widely as '''al-Zamakhshari''' (in {{lang-fa|محمود زمخشری}}), also called '''Jar Allah''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] for "God's neighbour") (18 March 1075 &amp;ndash; 12 June 1144), was a medieval Muslim scholar of [[Central Asian peoples|Persian]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen MacAuliffe, ''Quranic Christians: An Analysis of Classical and Modern Exegesis'',Cambridge University Press, 1991, pg 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By Norman. Calder, Andrew Rippin, ''Classical Islam: A Sourcebook of Religious Literature'', Routledge, 2003,  pg 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iranica.com"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/chorasmia-iii Encyclopedia Iranica, "The Chorasmian Language", D.N.Mackenzie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Zamakhshari" in Encyclopedia of Islam, by C.H.M. Versteegh, Brill 2007. Excerpt:  "one of the outstanding scholars of later medieval Islamic times who made important contributions..despite his own Iranian descent, a strong proponent of the Arab cause vis-à-vis the [[Persophile]] partisans of Shabiyya."&lt;/ref&gt; who subscribed to the [[Mu'tazili|Muʿtazilite]] [[theological]] doctrine, who was born in [[Khwarezmia]], but lived most of his life in [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], and [[Baghdad]]. He was a great authority on the Arabic language as well as a rationalist theologian.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glassé and Huston Smith.

[[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]]: [[Rowman Altamira]], 2003. {{ISBN|9780759101906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Al-Zamakhshari was born in [[Zamakhshar]], [[Khwarezmia]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, on Wednesday 27 Rajab, 467 AH/ 18 March, 1075 AD. He became a renowned scholar of the [[Mutazilite]] school of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hodgson |first=Marshall G.S |year=1977 |title= The Venture of Islam Volume 2: The Expansion of Islam in the Middle Periods |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=USA |page=308|isbn=978-0-226-34684-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used [[Persian language|Persian]] for some of his work, although he was a strong supporter of the Arabic language as well as an opponent of the [[Shu'ubiyya]] movement.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Zamakhsharī|volume=28|page=951}}&lt;/ref&gt; After losing one of his feet to [[frostbite]], he carried a [[Notary public|notarized]] declaration that his foot was missing due to accident, rather than a legal amputation for any crime.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Marinus Zwemer, "A Moslem Seeker After God"&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for ''[[Al-Kashshaaf]]'', a seminal commentary on the [[Koran|Qur'an]]. The commentary is famous for its deep [[linguistics|linguistic]] analysis of the verses, however has been criticised for the inclusion of [[Mu'tazilite]] philosophical views.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Esposito]], [[The Oxford Dictionary of Islam]], pg. 346. [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2004. {{ISBN|9780195125597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years he stayed in [[Mecca]], for which he became known as Jar-Allah ("God's neighbour"). He later returned to [[Khwarezm]], where he died in 1144 at the capital [[Gorgan]] (in the present Gulestan Province, Iran).

He studied at [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]] while enjoying the fellowship of jurists of [[Baghdad]].

== Death ==
Al-Zamakhshari  died in the Monday night of 8th Zulhijja, 538 AH/ 12 June, 1144 AD.

==Works==
The author of more than fifty books,&lt;ref&gt;Kifayat Ullah, ''Al-Kashshaf: Al-Zamakhshari's Mu'tazilite Exegesis of the Qur'an'', de Gruyter (2017), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Zamakhshari's fame as a scholar rests upon his commentary on the Qur'an. In spite of its [[Mu'tazili]] theology it was famous among scholars.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

=== Zamakhshari and the Khwaresmian language ===

The greater part of the surviving vocabulary of the now extinct [[Iranian Languages|Iranian]] [[Khwarezmian language|Kwaresmian]] or Chorasmian language is found in the form of interlinear glosses throughout a single manuscript (of ca. 596/1200) of Zamakhshari's Arabic-Persian dictionary, the ''Muqaddimat al-adab'' (Zamakhshari may himself have been a native speaker).&lt;ref name="iranica.com" /&gt; Some other manuscripts of this work also contain a few such glosses.  Thus the ''Muqaddimat al-adab''  is a very important primary source for the study of this extinct language.

'''Anthony Meredith Quinton, Baron Quinton''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (25 March 1925&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/peers/peersQ.htm Leigh Rayment's Peerage]&lt;/ref&gt; – 19 June 2010)&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldtoday/01.htm#d2e45 Death Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Political philosophy|political]] and [[Ethics|moral]] [[philosopher]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysician]], and [[Materialism|materialist]] philosopher of [[Philosophy of mind|mind]].

==Life==
A fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]], he became a Fellow of [[New College, Oxford]], in 1955, and was President of [[Trinity College, Oxford]], from 1978 to 1987.

Quinton was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1975 to 1976.  He was chairman of the board of the [[British Library]] from 1985 to 1990.

In 1983, he was made a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Quinton''', of Holywell in the City of Oxford and County of [[Oxfordshire]].

To [[BBC Radio]] audiences, Quinton became well known as a presenter of the long-running ''[[Round Britain Quiz]]''.

==Metaphysics==
In the debate about philosophical universals, Quinton defended a variety of [[nominalism]] that identifies properties with a set of "natural" classes.&lt;ref name="PandC"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Properties and Classes|first=Anthony|last=Quinton|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|volume=58|year=1957|pages=33–58|jstor=4544588}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Malet Armstrong]] has been strongly critical of natural class nominalism: Armstrong believes that Quinton's 'natural' classes avoid a fairly fundamental flaw with more primitive class nominalisms, namely that it has to assume that for every class you can construct, it must then have an associated property. The problem for the class nominalist according to Armstrong is that one must come up with some criteria to determine classes that back properties and those which just contain a collection of heterogeneous objects.&lt;ref name="USR"&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=David Malet|title=Universals and Scientific Realism: Nominalism &amp; Realism|date=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521217415|pages=40–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UOI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=David Malet|title=Universals: An Opinionated Introduction|date=1989|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=0813307724|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinton's version of class nominalism asserts that determining which are the natural property classes is simply a basic fact that is not open to any further philosophical scrutiny. Armstrong argues that whatever it is which picks out the natural classes is not derived from the membership of that class, but from some fact about the particular itself.

While Quinton's theory states that no further analysis of the classes is possible, he also says that some classes may be more or less natural—that is, more or less unified than another class. Armstrong illustrates this intuitive difference Quinton is appealing to by pointing to the difference between the class of coloured objects and the class of [[crimson]] objects: the crimson object class is more unified in some intuitive sense (how is not specified) than the class of coloured objects.

In Quinton's 1957 paper, he sees his theory as a less extreme version of nominalism than that of [[Willard van Orman Quine]], [[Nelson Goodman]] and [[Stuart Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="PandC" /&gt;

== Metaphilosophy ==

=== His "shortest definition of philosophy" ===
{{cquote|The shortest definition, and it is quite a good one, is that philosophy is thinking about thinking. That brings out the generally second-order character of the subject, as reflective thought about particular kinds of thinking – formation of beliefs, claims to knowledge – about the world or large parts of it. — ''[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy|The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', p. 666 (1st ed.)}}

=== His longer definition ===
{{cquote| Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved. ''ibid''}}

'''Biblical hermeneutics''' is the study of the principles of interpretation concerning the [[books of the Bible]]. It is part of the broader field of [[hermeneutics]] which involves the study of principles of interpretation for all forms of communication, nonverbal and verbal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

While [[Talmudical Hermeneutics|Jewish]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] Biblical hermeneutics have some [[Judeo-Christian|overlap]] and [[Interfaith|dialogue]], they have distinctly separate interpretative traditions.

==Talmudical==
{{main|Talmudical hermeneutics}}

Talmudical hermeneutics ([[Hebrew]]: approximately, מידות שהתורה נדרשת בהן) refers to Jewish methods for the investigation and determination of the meaning of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], as well as rules by which [[Halakhah|Jewish law]] could be established.  One well-known summary of these principles appears in the [[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Methods by which the [[Talmud]] explores the meaning of scripture:
:* [[grammar]] and [[exegesis]]
:* the interpretation of certain words and letters and apparently superfluous and/or missing words or letters, and prefixes and suffixes
:* the interpretation of those letters which, in certain words, are provided with points
:* the interpretation of the letters in a word according to their numerical value (see [[Gematria]])
:* the interpretation of a word by dividing it into two or more words (see [[Notarikon]])
:* the interpretation of a word according to its consonantal form or according to its vocalization
:* the interpretation of a word by transposing its letters or by changing its vowels
:* the logical deduction of a ''[[halakah]]'' from a Scriptural text or from another law

The rabbis of the Talmud considered themselves to be the receivers and transmitters of an [[Oral Torah]] as to the meaning of the scriptures. They considered this [[oral tradition]] to set forth the precise, original meanings of the words, revealed at the same time and by the same means as the original scriptures themselves. Interpretive methods listed above such as word play and letter counting were never used as logical proof of the meaning or teaching of a scripture. Instead they were considered to be an ''asmakhta'', a validation of a meaning that was already set by tradition or a [[Homiletics|homiletic]] backing for rabbinic rulings.

==Christian==

Until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], biblical hermeneutics was usually seen as a form of special hermeneutics (like legal hermeneutics); the status of scripture was thought to necessitate a particular form of understanding and interpretation.

In the nineteenth century it became increasingly common to read scripture just like any other writing, although the different interpretations were often disputed. [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] argued against a distinction between "general" and "special" hermeneutics, and for a general theory of hermeneutics applicable to all [[Text (literary theory)|texts]], including the Bible. Various methods of [[Historical criticism|higher criticism]] sought to understand the Bible purely as a human, historical document.

The concept of hermeneutics has acquired at least two different but related meanings which are in use today. Firstly, in the older sense, biblical hermeneutics may be understood as the theological principles of exegesis which is often virtually synonymous with 'principles of biblical interpretation' or methodology of [[biblical exegesis]]. Secondly, the more recent development is to understand the term 'biblical hermeneutics' as the broader [[philosophical|philosophy]] and [[linguistic]] underpinnings of interpretation. The question is posed: "How is understanding possible?" The rationale of this approach is that, while Scripture is "more than just an ordinary text," it is certainly "no less than an ordinary text." Scripture is in the first analysis "text" which human beings try to understand; in this sense, the principles of understanding any text apply to the Bible as well (regardless of whatever other additional, specifically theological principles are considered).

In this second sense, all aspects of philosophical and linguistic hermeneutics are considered to be applicable to the biblical texts, as well. There are obvious examples of this in the links between [[20th-century philosophy]] and Christian [[theology]]. For example, [[Rudolf Bultmann]]'s hermeneutical approach was strongly influenced by [[existentialism]], and in particular by the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]]; and since the 1970s, the philosophical hermeneutics of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] have had a wide-ranging influence on biblical hermeneutics as developed by a wide range of Christian theologians. The French-American philosopher [[René Girard]] follows a similar trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Simon|title=Resurrecting Interpretation|year=2005|publisher=University of Bristol|location=Bristol Baptist College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diverse interpretations===
Biblical scholars have noted the diversity of interpretations by [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and to a lesser extent by [[Catholic Church|Catholics]]. In his forward to [[R. C. Sproul]]’s ''Knowing Scripture'', [[J. I. Packer]] observes that Protestant theologians are in conflict about biblical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Sproul, ''Knowing Scripture'' (Rev. ed., InterVarsity Press, 2009), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate the diversity of biblical interpretations, William Yarchin&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apu.edu/honors/faculty/byarchin/&lt;/ref&gt; pictures a shelf full of religious books saying different things, but all claiming to be faithful interpretations of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;William Yarchin, ''History of Biblical Interpretation: a Reader'' (Hendrickson, 2004), xi.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Ramm]] observed that such diverse interpretations underlie the doctrinal variations in Christendom.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Ramm, ''Protestant Biblical Interpretation:A Textbook of Hermeneutics, 3rd rev ed'' (Baker Academic, 1980), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A mid-19th century book on biblical interpretation observed that even those who believe the Bible to be the word of God hold the most discordant views about fundamental doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;''The Interpretation of the Bible'' (Boston; Massachusetts Sabbath School Society, 1844), 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church asserts the capital importance of biblical interpretation and Catholic scholars recognize some diversity in the Bible. This allows for an openness of interpretation as long as it stays within the Catholic Church’s theological Tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Williamson, ''Catholic Principles for Interpreting Scripture: A Study of the Pontifical Biblical Commission’s “The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church”'' (Gregorian Biblical BookShop, 2001), 23, 121, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; So it is that theological factors set the parameters for interpreting the Scripture that Catholics believe to be the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Williams, ''Receiving the Bible in Faith: Historical and Theological Exegesis'' (CUA Press, 2004), 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such parameters disallow the widely differing interpretations that make it possible for Protestants to prove almost anything by the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Roy B. Zuck, ''Basic Bible Interpretation'' (David C. Cook, 1991), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological hermeneutics as traditional Christian Biblical exegesis===

This form of [[theological hermeneutics]] in the mainstream Protestant tradition considers Christian Biblical hermeneutics in the tradition of explication of the text, or [[exegesis]], to deal with various principles that can be applied to the study of [[Scripture]]. If the [[Biblical canon|canon]] of Scripture is considered as an organic whole, rather than an accumulation of disparate individual texts written and edited in the course of history, then any interpretation that contradicts any other part of scripture is not considered to be sound. Biblical hermeneutics differs from hermeneutics and within traditional Protestant [[theology]], there are a variety of interpretive formulae. Such formulae are generally not mutually exclusive, and interpreters may adhere to several of these approaches at once. These formulae include:&lt;ref&gt;This list of "principles" in conservative [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] hermeneutics appears to derive from: Hartill, J E 1960. ''Principles of Biblical Hermeneutics''. Grand Rapids: Zondervan.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theological Group of Principles''':

:*The '''[[Historical-grammatical method|Historical-grammatical]]''' principle based on historical, socio-political, geographical, cultural and linguistic / grammatical context
:*Alternate, mutually-exclusive, models of history:
:**The '''[[Dispensationalism|Dispensational model]]''' or The '''Chronometrical Principle''': "During different periods of time, God has chosen to deal in a particular way with man in respect to sin and man's responsibility."
:**The '''[[Covenantalism|Covenantal model]]''': "We differentiate between the various contracts that God has made with his people; specifically their provisions, their parties and their purposes."
:**The '''[[New Covenant Theology|New-Covenantal]]''' model: The Old Testament Laws have been fulfilled and abrogated or cancelled with Christ's death, and replaced with the Law of Christ of the New Covenant, although many of the Old Covenant laws are reinstituted under the New Covenant.
:*The '''Ethnic Division Principle''': "The word of truth is rightly divided in relation to the three classes which it treats, i.e. Jews, [[Gentiles]] and the Church."
:*The '''Breach Principle''': Interpretation of a certain verse or passage in Scripture is aided by a consideration of certain breaches, either breaches of promise or breaches of time.
:*The '''[[Christo-Centric Principle]]''': "The mind of deity is eternally centered in Christ. All angelic thought and ministry are centered in Christ. All Satanic hatred and subtlety are centered at Christ. All human hopes are, and human occupations should be, centered in Christ. The whole material universe in creation is centered in Christ. The entire written word is centered in Christ."
:*The '''Moral Principle'''
:*The '''Discriminational Principle''': "We should divide the word of truth so as to make a distinction where God makes a difference."
:*The '''Predictive Principle'''
:*The '''Application Principle''': "An application of truth may be made only after the correct interpretation has been made"
:*The '''Principle of Human Willingness in Illumination'''
:*The '''Context Principle''': "God gives light upon a subject through either near or remote passages bearing upon the same subject."

'''Sub-divided Context/Mention Principles''':
:*The '''First Mention Principle''': "God indicates in the first mention of a subject the truth with which that subject stands connected in the mind of God."
:*The '''Progressive Mention Principle''': "God makes the revelation of any given truth increasingly clear as the word proceeds to its consummation."
:*The '''Comparative Mention Principle'''
:*The '''Full Mention Principle''' or The '''Complete Mention Principle''': "God declares his full mind upon any subject vital to our spiritual life."
:*The '''Agreement Principle''': "The truthfulness and faithfulness of God become the guarantee that he will not set forth any passage in his word that contradicts any other passage."
:*The '''Direct Statement Principle''': "God says what he means and means what he says."
:*The '''Gap Principle''': "God, in the Jewish Scriptures, ignores certain periods of time, leaping over them without comment."
:*The '''Threefold Principle''': "The word of God sets forth the truths of salvation in a three-fold way: past - justification; present - sanctification/transformation; future - glorification/consummation."
:*The '''Repetition Principle''': "God repeats some truth or subject already given, generally with the addition of details not before given."
:*The '''Synthetic Principle'''
:*The '''Principle of Illustrative Mention'''
:*The '''Double Reference Principle'''

'''Figures of Speech Group of Principles''':
:*The '''Numerical Principle'''
:*The '''Symbolic Principle'''
:*The '''Typical Principle''': "Certain people, events, objects and rituals found in the Old Testament may serve as object lessons and pictures by which God teaches us of his grace and saving power."
:*The '''Parabolic Principle'''
:*The '''Allegorical Principle'''

==Techniques==
In the interpretation of a text, hermeneutics considers the original medium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblicalperformancecriticism.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45:wire-conference&amp;catid=3:newsflash|title=Biblical Performance Criticism|first=Peter|last=Perry|date=|website=www.biblicalperformancecriticism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as what language says, supposes, doesn't say, and implies. The process consists of several steps for best attaining the Scriptural author's intended meaning(s).  One such process is taught by Henry A Virkler, in ''Hermeneutics: Principles and Processes of Biblical Interpretation'' (1981):

:*'''Lexical-syntactical analysis''': This step looks at the words used and the way the words are used.  Different order of the sentence, the punctuation, the tense of the verse are all aspects that are looked at in the lexical syntactical method.  Here, lexicons and grammar aids can help in extracting meaning from the text.
:*'''Historical/cultural analysis''': The history and culture surrounding the authors is important to understand to aid in interpretation.  For instance, understanding the Jewish sects of the Palestine and the government that ruled Palestine in New Testament times increases understanding of Scripture.  And, understanding the connotations of positions such as the High Priest and that of the tax collector helps us know what others thought of the people holding these positions.
:*'''Contextual analysis''': A verse out of context can often be taken to mean something completely different from the intention.  This method focuses on the importance of looking at the context of a verse in its chapter, book and even biblical context.
:*'''Theological analysis''': It is often said that a single verse usually doesn't make a theology.  This is because Scripture often touches on issues in several books.  For instance, gifts of the Spirit are spoken about in Romans, Ephesians and 1 Corinthians.  To take a verse from Corinthians without taking into account other passages that deal with the same topic can cause a poor interpretation.
:*'''Special literary analysis''': There are several special literary aspects to look at, but the overarching theme is that each genre of Scripture has a different set of rules that applies to it.  Of the genres found in Scripture, there are: narratives, histories, prophecies, apocalyptic writings, poetry, psalms and letters.  In these, there are differing levels of allegory, figurative language, metaphors, similes and literal language.  For instance, the apocalyptic writings and poetry have more figurative and allegorical language than does the narrative or historical writing.  These must be addressed, and the genre recognized to gain a full understanding of the intended meaning.

[[Howard Hendricks]], longtime professor of hermeneutics at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]], set out the method of observing the text, interpreting the text, applying the text in his book, ''Living By the Book''. Other major Christian teachers, such as [[Chuck Swindoll|Charles R. (Chuck) Swindoll]], who wrote the foreword, [[Kay Arthur]] and [[David Jeremiah]] have based their hermeneutics on the principles Hendricks teaches.

In his book ''God Centered Biblical Interpretation'' (1999), [[Vern Poythress]], Professor of New Testament Interpretation at [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] in Philadelphia, presented a hermeneutical technique based on the pattern of "speaker, discourse, and hearer".&lt;ref&gt;Poythress, Vern S. (1999). ''God Centered Biblical Interpretation'', p. 109. P&amp;R Publishing, Phillipsburg, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Poythress, the study of the Bible must acknowledge all three aspects: God as the speaker, the Bible as His speech, and the people to whom He speaks. Thus, context plays a primary role in Poythress's study of Biblical teachings. He lists three general concepts to understand about any passage of Scripture:

:*'''Original time and context''': This includes the personal perspective of the writer, the normative perspective of the text itself, and the situational perspective of the original audience.

:*'''Transmission and its context''': Understanding the transmission of Scripture includes contemplating the message being sent through the text, taking into account the concerns of individual writers/translators as well as its broader role in the unraveling narrative of history. 

:*'''Modern context''': Poythress calls interpreters to understand Scripture as "what God is saying now" to the individual as well as to the modern church.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 121 -122&lt;/ref&gt; 

David L. Barr states there are three obstacles that stand in the way of correctly interpreting the biblical writings: We speak a different language, we live approximately two millennia later, and we bring different expectations to the text.&lt;ref&gt;New Testament Story, Wadsworth Publishing, 1995, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Barr suggests that we approach the reading of the Bible with significantly different literary expectations than those in reading other forms of literature and writing.

===Roman Catholic===
{{see also|Roman Catholic theology of Scripture}} 
The Catholic Encyclopedia lists a number of principles guiding Roman Catholic hermeneutics in the article on Exegesis (note: the Catholic Encyclopedia was written in 1917 and does not reflect the changes set forth by the encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' published by Pius XII in 1943, which opened modern Catholic Biblical scholarship) :

:*'''Historico-grammatical interpretation''' - The meaning of the literary expression of the Bible is best learned by a thorough knowledge of the languages in which the original text of Scripture was written, and by acquaintance with the Scriptural way of speaking, including the various customs, laws, habits and national prejudices which influenced the inspired writers as they composed their respective books. [[John Paul II]] said that: "A second conclusion is that the very nature of biblical texts means that interpreting them will require continued use of the historical-critical method, at least in its principal procedures. The Bible, in effect, does not present itself as a direct revelation of timeless truths but as the written testimony to a series of interventions in which God reveals himself in human history. In a way that differs from tenets of other religions [such as Islam, for instance], the message of the Bible is solidly grounded in history.&lt;ref name="Pontifical Biblical Commission--Interpretation of the Bible"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholic-resources.org/ChurchDocs/PBC_Interp5.htm|title=The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church|accessdate=2007-05-21|author=Presented by the Pontifical Biblical Commission|date=1993-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*'''Catholic interpretation''' - Because the Catholic Church is, according to Catholics, the official custodian and interpreter of the Bible, Catholicism's teaching concerning the Sacred Scriptures and their genuine sense must be the supreme guide of the commentator. The Catholic commentator is bound to adhere to the interpretation of texts which the Church has defined either expressly or implicitly.
:*'''Reverence''' - Since the Bible is God's own book, its study must be begun and prosecuted with a spirit of reverence and [[Christian Prayers|prayer]].
:*'''Inerrancy''' - Since God is the principal Author of Sacred Scripture, it can be claimed to contain no error, no self-contradiction, nothing contrary to scientific or historical truth (when the original authors intended historical or scientific truth to be portrayed).  Minor contradictions are due to copyist errors in the codex or the translation. Catholics believe the Scripture is God's message put in words by men, with the imperfections this very fact necessarily implies. Catholic hermeneutics strongly supports inerrancy when it comes to principles but not, for example, when dealing with Evangelists' orthographic mistakes. According to Pope John Paul II, "Addressing men and women, from the beginnings of the Old Testament onward, God made use of all the possibilities of human language, while at the same time accepting that his word be subject to the constraints caused by the limitations of this language. Proper respect for inspired Scripture requires undertaking all the labors necessary to gain a thorough grasp of its meaning.&lt;ref name="Pontifical Biblical Commission--Interpretation of the Bible"/&gt;
:*'''Patristics''' - The Holy Fathers are of supreme authority whenever they all interpret in one and the same manner any text of the Bible, as pertaining to the doctrine of faith or morals; for their unanimity clearly evinces that such interpretation has come down from the Apostles as a matter of Catholic faith.
Pope Benedict XVI has indicated in Verbum Domini, the post-synodal apostolic exhortation on the Word of God, that "Christianity...perceives in the words the Word himself, the Logos who displays his mystery through this complexity and the reality of human history". He encourages a “faith-filled interpretation of Sacred Scripture”. He emphasizes that this manner of interpretation, “practiced from antiquity within the Church’s Tradition...recognizes the historical value of the biblical tradition". It "seeks to discover the living meaning of the Sacred Scriptures for the lives of believers today while not ignoring the human mediation of the inspired text and its literary genres". Verbum Domini #44.

===Eastern Orthodox===
:*'''God is real and is incarnated in our [[Lord]] Jesus Christ.'''  Everything pertaining to the Scriptures must be understood [[Christology|Christologically]].  [[Jesus Christ]], the incarnate Second Person of the [[Holy Trinity]], is the center of all that we as Christians do, and being Himself the very Truth, He is the only gate through which we may enter into understanding of the Bible, both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s (though not all that is contained in the Old Testament is directly relevant for Christians).  The Bible ultimately is about Christ and assists us in our union with Him.

:*'''Only the pure in heart "shall see God."'''  That is, our spiritual state has a direct bearing on our interpretation of the Scriptures.  As St. [[Athanasius the Great|Athanasius]] said, "One cannot possibly understand the teaching of the saints unless one has a pure mind and is trying to imitate their life."  Because the Scripture is a book inspired by the [[Holy Spirit]] and given through holy men, one's own holiness is directly relevant to the ability to interpret the book correctly.  Unlike any other book, the Bible's words are "spirit and life," and so we must live spiritually in order to drink from this spiritual well.  Clearly, [[prayer]] and spiritual discipline are necessary in order to understand Scripture properly.

:*'''Understanding of the Scripture comes with living its contents.'''  As the quote from St. [[Athanasius the Great|Athanasius]] illustrates, one must both have a pure mind and be trying to imitate the saints' lives in order to understand their teaching, a dual principle which applies most of all to the teaching of the saints in the Bible.  This life is particularly expressed in terms of living out the commandments and attempting to imitate Christ's life of the Gospel.

:*'''The primary end of Scriptural hermeneutics is that of the whole Christian life, [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]] (deification/divinization).'''  That is, our purpose in attempting to understand the Bible must not be merely for academic inquiry but rather must be in order to become fully divinized human beings, soaked with the life of God, participating in His [[divine energies]], growing to the fullness of the stature of Christ.  We interpret Scripture in order to become by grace what Christ is by nature, to "become god."

:*'''Only within the community of the Church can the Bible be understood.'''  It was written by the Church, in the Church and for the Church.  Thus, it is a "family document" which is the highest point of [[Holy Tradition]], taken with faith alongside the writings of the [[Church Fathers|Fathers]], the [[Divine Liturgy|Liturgy]], the [[Icons]], the Lives of the [[Saints]], and so on.

:*'''The Scripture is a witness to the truth, not an exhaustive tome on Christian living.''' Nowhere in the words of Scripture itself can we find the teaching that it is all-sufficient for Christian life.  What we as Orthodox Christians do must always be consonant with the Scriptures, but explicit mention of a practice or teaching in the Scripture is not a requirement for its inclusion in the life of the Church.  The [[Apostle Paul]] himself mentions the reality of unwritten sources of Church Tradition being equally in force for the believer in [[II Thessalonians]] 2:15, that these traditions to which we must "stand fast and hold" may be "by word or by our epistle."  Examples of practices not explicit in Scripture are making the [[Sign of the Cross]], triple immersion for [[baptism]], and having [[monasticism]].  St. [[Basil the Great]] even says that without maintaining the unwritten traditions of the Church, we "mutilate the Gospel" (''On the Spirit'' 66).

:*'''We must respect the integrity of the canon of the Bible as given to us in the Church's Tradition.'''  Searches for other texts written by apostles or prophets may be interesting and of scholarly merit, but they are not part of the hermeneutical project within the Church. Or conversely, attempts to debunk the authorship or authenticity of the books in the canon are also outside the Church's life.  If we were to find a verifiable "new" work by St. Paul or to discover that [[Moses]] did not in fact write [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], neither finding would have any bearing on the [[Biblical canon|canon]].  It is what it is.

:*'''We must use every resource at our disposal in interpreting the Scripture to bring ourselves and others to the knowledge of the truth.'''  Certainly, there must be spiritual discernment in knowing how to use those resources, but at least theoretically, anything can be used to come to know the truth better as it is revealed in Holy Writ.

:*'''We must have humility when approaching Scripture.'''  Even some of the Church's greatest and most philosophically sophisticated [[saints]] stated that some passages were difficult for them.  We must therefore be prepared to admit that our interpretations may be wrong, submitting them to the judgment of the Church.

:*'''We may make use in a secondary fashion of the resources of academic scholarship, whether logic, archaeology, linguistics, et cetera.'''  These resources can be helpful in terms of illuminating our understanding of Scripture, but they must always be given only secondary prominence in the project and always only in conjunction with all these other hermeneutic principles.  Primary must always be our life in the Church, living, studying and knowing the Bible within that vivified and salvific [[Holy Tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Archpriest Michael Dahulich|title=OrthodoxWiki article on Hermeneutics|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Hermeneutics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary reader of Scripture is in some way envisaged by the Biblical text as standing in continuity with a developing theme therein. The reader, then, is left to discern this trajectory and appropriate it accordingly.

[[William J. Webb]] employed such a hermeneutic, in his ''Slaves, Women &amp; Homosexuals''. Webb shows how the moral commands of the Old and New Testament were a significant improvement over the surrounding cultural values and practices. Webb identified 18 different ways in which God dealt with his people moving against the current of popular cultural values. While for Webb the use of this hermeneutic moves to highlight the progressive liberation of women and slaves from oppressive male/bourgeois dominance, the prohibition of [[homosexual]] acts consistently moves in a more conservative manner than that of the surrounding [[Ancient Near East]] or [[Graeco-Roman]] societies. While Paul does not explicitly state that [[slavery]] should be abolished, the trajectory seen in Scripture is a progressive liberation of slaves. When this is extended to modern times, it implies that the Biblical witness supports the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. The progressive [[Women's rights|liberation of women]] from oppressive patriarchalism, traced from Genesis and Exodus through to Paul's own acknowledgement of women as 'co-workers' ({{bibleref2|Romans|16:3|NLT|Rom. 16:3}}), sets a precedent that when applied to modern times suggests that women ought to have the same rights and roles afforded to men. Historically, the Biblical witness has become progressively more stringent in its views of homosexual practice and the implications of this are not commented upon by Webb.

'''Phra Dharmakosacarya (Nguam Indapañño)''' ({{lang-th|พระธรรมโกศาจารย์ (เงื่อม อินฺทปญฺโญ)}}; {{RTGS|''Phra Thammakosachan (Ngueam Inthapanyo)''}}), also known as '''Buddhadasa Bhikkhu''' ({{lang-th|พุทธทาสภิกขุ}}; {{RTGS|''Phutthathat Phikkhu''}}, May 27, 1906 – May 25, 1993) was a famous and influential Thai ascetic-philosopher of the 20th century. Known as an innovative reinterpreter of [[Buddhism|Buddhist doctrine]] and [[Thai folklore|Thai folk belief]]s, Buddhadasa fostered a reformation in conventional religious perceptions in his home country, [[Thailand]], as well as abroad. Buddhadasa developed a personal view that those who have penetrated the essential nature of religions consider "all religions to be inwardly the same", while those who have the highest understanding of ''dhamma'' feel "there is no religion".&lt;ref name=noreligionspeech/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early years===
He was born Nguam Phanit ({{lang-th|เงื่อม พานิช}}; {{RTGS|''Ngueam Phanit''}}) in 1906 in Ban Phumriang, [[Chaiya District]], southern Thailand. His father, Sieng Phānit, was a shopkeeper of second generation [[Thai Chinese]] ([[Hokkien]]) ancestry and his mother, Klaun, was [[Thai people|Thai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bieson.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/volltexte/2003/124/ Suchira Payulpitack, Buddhadasa's Movement: An Analysis of Its Origins, Development, and Social Impact], a Doctorate dissertation, faculty of Sociology, Universität Bielefeld, 1992: 72-3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Religious life===
[[File:Cremation of Buddhadasa 1993.jpg|thumb|Cremation of Buddhadasa in 1993]]

Buddhadasa renounced civilian life in 1926. Typical of young monks during the time, he traveled to the capital, [[Bangkok]], for doctrinal training but found the [[wat]]s there dirty, crowded, and, most troubling to him, the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] corrupt, "preoccupied with prestige, position, and comfort with little interest in the highest ideals of Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;Payulpitack, 1992: 123.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he returned to his native rural district and occupied a forest tract near to his village, founding ''Suan Mokkh''{{refn|group=note|From Thai {{lang|th|สวน}} ''suan'' "garden" and [[Pali]] ''[[moksha]]'' "release, liberation". Moksha holds the sense of 'shedding ones skin.' See Harris, [http://bauddhamata.blogspot.com/2009/06/moksha-etymological-note.html Moksha: an etymological note, Bauddhamata, 15.6.2009].&lt;/ref&gt;}} in 1932.

In later years, Buddhadasa's teachings attracted many international seekers to his hermitage. He held talks with leading scholars and clergy of various faiths. His aim in these discussions was to probe the similarities at the heart of each of the major world religions. Before his death in 1993, he established an International Dhamma Hermitage Center across the highway from his own retreat to aid in the teaching of Buddhism and other yogic practices to international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.suanmokkh.org/buddhadasa | title= Ajahn Buddhadasa | website= suanmokkh.org |access-date= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of ''Suan Mokkh'' was expanded to
approximately 120 acres of forest.&lt;ref name="Selin2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Selin, Helaine|title=Nature Across Cultures: Views of Nature and the Environment in Non-Western Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPqPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-017-0149-5|pages=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, Buddhadasa was skeptical of his fame; when reflecting on the busloads of visitors to Suan Mokkh he would say, "sometimes I think many of these people just stop here because they have to visit the bathroom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bhikkhu|first=Buddhadasa|editor-first=Santikaro|editor-last=Bhikkhu|title=Heartwood of the Bodhi Tree |publisher=Wisdom Publication |date=1994|pages=ix|chapter=Foreword|isbn=0-86171-035-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings and interpretations==
Buddhadasa strove for a simple, pristine practice in attempt to emulate [[Gautama Buddha]]'s core teaching, "Do good, avoid bad, and purify the mind." He therefore avoided the customary ritualism and internal politics that dominated Siamese clerical life. His ability to explain complex philosophical and religious ideas in his native [[Southern Thai language|Southern Thai]] attracted many people to his wooded retreat.

His primary teaching mainly focused on the quiet awareness of one's breathing pattern called [[anapanasati]]. However, his personal practice was very much grounded in advanced research and interpretation of early Pali texts on the one hand and on his radical private experimentation on the other.

===Rejection of rebirth===
Buddhadasa rejected the traditional [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] doctrine, since he thought it to be incompatible with ''[[sunyata]]'', and not conductive to the extinction of ''[[dukkha]]''.{{sfn|Buddhadasa|1985a}} 

Buddhadasa, states John Powers – a professor of Asian Studies and Buddhism, offered a "rationalist interpretation" and called "the whole question of rebirth to be foolish".&lt;ref name="Emmanuel2017p231"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Powers|editor=Steven M. Emmanuel|title=Buddhist Philosophy: A Comparative Approach|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=n08nDwAAQBAJ| year=2017|publisher= Wiley|isbn=978-1-119-06825-9 |pages=221–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddhadasa, the Buddha taught 'no-self' (Skt ''anatman'', Pali ''[[anatta]]''), which denies any substantial, ongoing entity or soul.&lt;ref name="Emmanuel2017p231"/&gt; Powers quotes Buddhadasa view as, "because there is no one born, there is no one who dies and is reborn". Therefore, states Buddhadasa, "the whole question of rebirth has nothing to do with Buddhism... in the sphere of the Buddhist teachings there is no question of rebirth or reincarnation". Its goal is ''nibbana'', which Buddhadasa describes as a state "beyond all suffering that also transcends ordinary conceptions of happiness."&lt;ref name="Emmanuel2017p231"/&gt;

Buddhadasa explains [[paticcasamupadda]] as the "birth" of "I" and mine through sense-contact with objects, and the resulting [[vedana]] ("feeling"), [[tanha]] ("thirst," craving) and [[upadana]] (clinging). It is by relinquising the notion of "I" and "mine" that selfish clinging is abandoned, and [[Nirvana]] or true [[Sunyata|emptiness]] will be reached.{{sfn|Buddhadasa|1985a}} This can be done by "not allow[ing] the dependent arising to take place; to cut it off right at the moment of sense-contact."{{sfn|Buddhadasa|1985a}}

Buddhadasa's views have been "strongly criticized"&lt;ref&gt;Steve Odin (2011), ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23015264 Reviewed Work: Buddhadāsa: Theravada Buddhism and Modernist Reform in Thailand by Peter A. Jackson]'', Philosophy East and West, University of Hawai'i Press, Vol. 61, No. 1, pp. 221-231&lt;/ref&gt; and rejected by many of his fellow Theravada Buddhism monks with a more orthodox view of the Buddhist Dhamma. For example, [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] states that Buddhadasa's approach of jettisoning the rebirth doctrine "would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tatters... the conception of rebirth is an essential plank to its ethical theory, providing an incentive for avoiding all evil and doing good", summarizes Powers.&lt;ref name="Emmanuel2017p231"/&gt;

===No religion===
From the earliest period of his religious studies, Buddhadasa utilized a comparative approach and sought to be able to explain "Buddhist's teachings through other thought systems such as Taoism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Jainism and Natural Science."&lt;ref&gt;Payulpitack, 1992: 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Through such a methodology he came to adopt a religious world-view wherein he stated, "those who have penetrated to the essential nature of religion will regard all religions as being the same. Although they may say there is Buddhism, Judaism, Taoism, Islam, or whatever, they will also say that all religions are inwardly the same."&lt;ref name=noreligionspeech/&gt;

In his ''No Religion'' (1993) Buddhadasa he further famously remarked:
{{quote|...those who have penetrated to the highest understanding of Dhamma will feel that the thing called "religion" doesn't exist after all.  There is no Buddhism; there is no Christianity; there is no Islam.  How can they be the same or in conflict when they don't even exist? (...) Thus, the phrase "No religion!" is actually Dhamma language of the highest level.&lt;ref name=noreligionspeech&gt;[http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/B%20-%20Theravada/Teachers/Buddhadasa/No%20Religion/NORELIG.HTM Buddhadasa, No Religion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320144336/http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/B%20-%20Theravada/Teachers/Buddhadasa/No%20Religion/NORELIG.HTM |date=March 20, 2013 }}, trans. Punno, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Influence==
[[File:Suan Mokkh Sala.jpg|thumb|Meditation hall in Buddhadhasa´s Suan Mokkh  (Garden of Liberation) monastery]]
Buddhadasa's interpretations of the Buddhist tradition inspired such persons as the French-schooled [[Pridi Banomyong]], leader of the [[Siamese revolution of 1932]], and a group of Thai social activists and artists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=MAyCVSnMa7AC&amp;pg=PA37 |pp= 37–38 | title= Rising China and Asian Democratization: Socialization to "Global Culture" in the Political Transformations of Thailand, China, and Taiwan |author= Daniel Lynch |publisher= Stanford University Press |year= 2006 |ISBN= 0-8047-5394-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious scholar Donald K. Swearer has compared Buddhadasa to the early Indian philosopher [[Nagarjuna]],&lt;ref&gt;D.K. Swearer, Dhammic Socialism. Bangkok: Thai Inter-Religious Commission for Development, 1986: 14. Cited in Payulpitack, 1992: 103, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 5th-century south Indian scholar [[Buddhaghosa]] who has "overshadowed the development of Theravada Buddhist thought" in southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="Buddhadasa1991p2"/&gt; According to Swearer, the Thai teacher Buddhadasa "stands in polar opposition to such normative figures as Buddhaghosa" in several respects. Buddhadasa's writings, for example, decidedly contrast with the scholastic and highly influential ''Visuddhimagga'' of Buddhaghosa.&lt;ref name="Buddhadasa1991p2"/&gt; Buddhadasa has been influential in the ''arannavasi'' (forest tradition) of Thai Buddhism, and his ideas have influenced the radical sectarian movement founder [[Santi Asoke]], according to Swearer.&lt;ref name="Buddhadasa1991p2"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bhikku Buddhadasa|author2=Donald K Swearer (Translator)|title=Me and Mine: Selected Essays of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vpqr-eqdRusC |year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2166-7|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholars such as Peter Jackson and Daniel Lynch, Buddhadasa was heavily influenced by the ideas found in Zen Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter A. Jackson|title=Buddhadasa: A Buddhist Thinker for the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8sKAAAAYAAJ|year =1988|publisher= Siam Society|isbn= 978-974-8298-18-4|pages=222–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lynch2006"/&gt; Buddhadasa considered the Zen ideas as a way to reconcile Theravada Buddhism with modern humanism, and thought them to be the reason for Japan's economic strength.&lt;ref name="Lynch2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Lynch|title=Rising China and Asian Democratization: Socialization to "Global Culture" in the Political Transformations of Thailand, China, and Taiwan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAyCVSnMa7AC&amp;pg=PA38| year=2006|publisher= Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-7947-0|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christian]] [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] religious history, the '''Colarbasians''' (from Gk. '''Colarbasus''', Hippol., Ps. Tert.; Colorbasus, Iren., Epiph., Theodoret, Philast. cod., Aug.; ''C. Bassus'' Philast. codd.) were a supposed  [[sect]] of the 2nd century, deemed [[heresy|heretics]], so called from their leader Colarbasus, a disciple of [[Valentinius]]. Colarbasus, along with [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]], another disciple of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinius]], was said to maintain the whole plenitude, and perfection of [[truth]] and [[religion]], to be contained in the [[Greek alphabet]]; and that it was for this reason that [[Jesus]] was called the ''[[Alpha and Omega (Christianity)|Alpha and Omega]]''.

==Analysis==
The name occurs first, and that only incidentally, in a solitary passage of [[Irenaeus]] ([http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103114.htm i. 14, 1]) which has been the subject of much discussion.
{{cquote| This Marcus then, declaring that he alone was the matrix and receptacle of the Sige of Colorbasus, inasmuch as he was only-begotten, has brought to the birth in some such way as follows that which was committed to him of the defective Enthymesis. }}
[[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]], Irenaeus seems to say, boasted that he alone was allowed to become the womb and receptacle of the Sigé (''Silence'') of Colarbasus; the offspring to which he gave birth being the statement and revelation recorded afterwards. There is no previous mention of Colarbasus. Irenaeus has for six pages been speaking of Marcus alone. Eleven pages back he refers briefly to "a certain other ''Illustrious'' teacher of theirs" [the [[Valentinians]]]; but there is no coincidence of doctrine, and nothing to suggest that the nameless, or obscurely named [Epiphanes], heretic was himself Colarbasus, as some have supposed.

===Sources===
According to [[Philastrius|Philaster]] (''Haer''. 43) Colarbasus taught after Marcus and "in like manner:" his two lines of description are merely a vague echo of [[Marcosians|Marcosian]] doctrine. Pseudo-Tertullian (15) combines the two names indistinguishably in one article. Their common source, the lost Compendium of [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], can have contained no special information about Colarbasus. When Hippolytus wrote the great later treatise ''[[Philosophumena|Against all Heresies]]'', he was evidently not better instructed. At the beginning of the sixth book he promises to describe "the doctrines held by Marcus and Colarbasus;" he devotes in due course twenty-three pages to a repetition of Irenaeus's account of Marcus; and at the end he considers he has sufficiently shown who [viz., [[Pythagoreans]] and [[astrology|astrologers]]] were the masters of Marcus and Colarbasus, "the successors in the school of Valentinus:" yet not a word is given to Colarbasus separately. Once elsewhere (iv. 13) Colarbasus is said to have "endeavoured to expound theology by measures and numbers;" but this is simply the Marcosian method.

The proceeding of [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] is more audacious. He has a separate article (''[[Panarion|Haer]]'', xxxv. 258–262) on Colarbasus, the composition of which has been fully laid bare by [[R. A. Lipsius]] (''Zur Quellengesch. d. Epiph''. 167 f.). The long account of Marcus in Irenaeus is preceded by a series of short notices (mostly without names) of the chief doctrines maintained by different branches of the great Valentinian sect. The passage relating to one group distinguished as "those who are reputed to be the wiser among them," is transferred bodily by Epiphanius to Colarbasus, and with it, stranger still, the next paragraph down to the end of the chapter, though it sets forth in single sentences the doctrines of no less than five sets of Valentinians about the Saviour. The passage about the "wise" group immediately follows one on [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemaeus]]; and accordingly Epiphanius makes Colarbasus to spring from "the root of Ptolemaeus," as well as to borrow from Marcus, and attributes to him a purpose of devising a greater and more ingenious scheme than his predecessors.

[[Theodoret]] (''Haer. Fab''. i. 12) merely abbreviates Epiphanius, changing at the same time "Colorbasus" into "the Colorbasians." A doubtful conjecture has brought Colarbasus into a single sentence of [[Tertullian]] (''adv. Val.'' 4), where at most no more is said than that a road was marked out for him by Valentinus; Ptolemaeus is named next, then [[Heracleon]], Secundus, and Marcus.

All these various writers against heresies are known to have learned, directly or indirectly, from Irenaeus; and every statement of theirs about Colarbasus can be at once traced, through transcription or immediate inference, to something in the text of Irenaeus not far distant from the place where the name of Colarbasus occurs. On the other hand, the reports of doctrine have little or nothing in common, Hippolytus and his followers make Colarbasus to have taught only what Marcus taught: Epiphanius and his copyist fathers upon him the discordant views of a miscellaneous cluster of Valentinians.

===The Voice of Four===
The credit of detecting the cause of the confusion belongs to C. A. Heumann (''Hamburgische Vermischte Bibliothek'', 1743, i. 145). He got rid of the mysterious double of Marcus by pointing out that ''Chol-arba'' (כלארבע) means "''All-Four''" i.e. the divine Tetrad, which in the scheme of Marcus stood at the head of the Pleroma. He was less successful in dealing with the details of the text: and [[F. C. Baur]] (''K.G. d.'' 3 ''erst. Jahrh''. i. 204) has rightly substituted ''Col'' (קול) for ''Chol'' (''The Voice of Four'' for ''All-Four''). Volkmar explains the appearance of ''s'' by the Aramaic commutation of ע with צ, and the ''o'' of several authorities by Theodoret's ''Kossianos'' for ''Kassianos'': ''Colassae'' and ''Colossae'' afford a still better illustration.

===Sigé===
Both the Tetrad and Sigé appear in the context as if they made revelations to Marcus, but (what has not been sufficiently observed) in different ways. When Irenaeus is simply recording what he found in his Marcosian authority, he speaks of the Tetrad or Tetractys. Thus (66–69):—

{{cquote|That the Tetrad herself came down to him from the highest and from the invisible [and innominable] places in female form, because, it is said, the world could not bear her male [element], and that she made known who she was ... And that the Tetractys, when she had explained this to him, said 'And I will also show thee' ... And as Marcus waited expecting her [''Aletheia'' or Truth, another [[aeon]]] to say something more, the Tetractys again came forward and spoke ...}}

Sigé on the other hand, is mentioned only when Irenaeus speaks in his own person, and always with a touch of sarcasm. Thus (68–78):

{{cquote|... the letters of which Marcus's Sigé (''he Markou Sigê'') pronounced (''edogmatise'') the 'Forefather' to consist ... and he [apparently 'Perfect Reason'] uses as his minister the greatness of the seven numbers, as says Marcus's Sigé ... and the seventh [heaven] shouts out the letter O, as Marcus's Sigé positively affirms, she who babbles at great length but says nothing true ... Thus then the all-wise Sigé announces to him the origin of the 24 letters ... Who will endure that Sigé of thine that babbles so much, her who names the Innominable, and declares the Unutterable, and expounds the Unsearchable?}}

It may therefore be questioned whether Marcus ever represented Sigé as herself visiting him. Two passages indeed suggest pretty clearly that he held her to be faithful to her name. Speaking of "Truth," virtually the alphabet, also called Man, he says (69) that she "is the fountain of every speech, and the beginning of every voice, and the utterance of everything unutterable, and the mouth of the unspoken Sigé (''tês siôpômenês Sigês''). Again we hear (64) that Marcosians were taught to offer a prayer for deliverance from "the Judge" to a female divinity addressed as "thou that sittest beside God and the mystic Sigé before the aeons" (or ages: ''ô paredre theou k. t. l.''). This address supplies the required clue, for the divinity is called "the Mother," in a passage almost immediately preceding the occurrence of the name Colarbasus; and elsewhere (75: cf. 84) "the Mother of the Universe" is identified with "the first Tetrad." Sigé herself then doubtless remains hidden above; but her mysteries are made known to Marcus by the Tetrad, the ''Colarbas'' or ''Voice of Four'', who must be the (nameless) "most mighty power from the invisible and innominable places," to whom he boasted that he owed his "knowledge," as we read in Irenaeus's first paragraph about him (60).

The difficulty of the primary phrase ''tês Kolarbasou Sigês'' remains. In the absence of a second article, it can only mean "the Sigé of Colarbas" (or Colarbasus) instead of "the Colarbas (or Colarba) of Sigé," as the sense above elicited requires. The difficulty would be lightened, and the perplexing termination of ''Kolarbasou'' at the same time removed, by reading ''tês Kolarbas ek Sigês'', "the Colarba (Voice of Four) proceeding out of Sigé (Silence)." In round continuous uncials the change would be easy, '''EK''' and '''OY''' having much resemblance when written. The two names would thus stand in the right relation to each other. The phrase however would still be briefer than we should expect. The sudden appearance of the Hebrew term remains likewise unaccounted for. The obscurity evidently lies in the original text of Irenaeus, if not of the authority whom he followed; and it was found as embarrassing in the 3rd and 4th centuries as now. It was only disguised, not removed, by supposing a heretic named Colarbasus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10494">'''Digital philosophy''' (also '''digital ontology''') is a direction in [[philosophy]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] advocated by certain [[mathematician]]s and [[theoretical physicist]]s, including: [[Edward Fredkin]], [[Konrad Zuse]], [[Stephen Wolfram]], [[Rudy Rucker]], [[Gregory Chaitin]], and [[Seth Lloyd]].

==Overview==

Digital philosophy is a modern re-interpretation of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s [[monism|monist]] [[metaphysics]], one that replaces Leibniz's [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]s with aspects of the theory of [[cellular automata]]. Since, following Leibniz, the mind can be given a [[computation]]al treatment, digital philosophy attempts to consider some main issues in the [[philosophy of mind]]. The digital approach attempts to deal with the non-deterministic quantum theory, where it assumes that all information must have finite and discrete means of its representation, and that the evolution of a physical state is governed by local and deterministic rules.&lt;ref name="Fredkin1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fredkin, Edward|title=An Introduction to Digital Philosophy|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|number=2|volume=42|year=2003|doi=10.1023/A:1024443232206|pages=189–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[digital physics]], existence and thought would consist of only computation. (However, not all computation would be thought.) Thus computation is the single substance of a [[monist]] [[metaphysics]], while [[subjectivity]] arises from computational [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]]. There are many variants of digital philosophy; however, most of them are [[Digital data]] theories that view all of [[Philosophy of physics|physical realities]] and [[cognitive science]] and so on, in framework of [[information theory]].&lt;ref name="Fredkin1"/&gt;

==Digital philosophers==
*[[Edward Fredkin]]. In his paper "Finite Nature" (1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://64.78.31.152/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/finite_nature.pdf |author=Fredkin, E. |title=Finite Nature |conference=Proceedings of the XXVIIth Rencotre de Moriond |year=1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829040406/http://64.78.31.152/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/finite_nature.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; computer pioneer Edward Fredkin stated two fundamental laws of [[physical information]]. As [[unsolved problems in physics]] these two fundamental laws have two fundamental [[Logical consequence|consequences]].
# All information must have a digital means of its [[Representation (systemics)|representation]].
# An informational processes transform the digital representation of the state of the system into its future state.
# If Fredkin's first fundamental law of information is correct then Einstein's theory of [[general relativity theory]] is not entirely correct, because the theory does not rely upon [[digital information]].
# If Fredkin's second fundamental law is correct then the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]] is not entirely correct, because quantum randomness lacks a digitally [[deterministic]] explanation.
*[[Stephen Wolfram]]. In Chapter 9 of ''[[A New Kind of Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;* Wolfram, Stephen, ''[http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline A New Kind of Science]''. Wolfram Media, Inc., May 14, 2002. {{ISBN|1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Wolfram]] presents an outline of a [[multiverse]] [[automaton]].
# Below the [[Planck scale]], there is an informational substrate that allows the build-up of [[Philosophy of physics|time, space, and energy]] by means of an updating parameter.
# The updating parameter for the multiverse is analogous to time via a mathematical [[isomorphism]], but the updating parameter involves a decomposition across [[Many-worlds interpretation|alternate universes]].
# The informational substrate consists of [[network node]]s that can simulate [[random network]] models and [[Path integral formulation|Feynman path integrals]].
# In physical reality, both [[energy]] and [[spacetime]] are secondary features. The most fundamental feature of reality is [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] [[Wave propagation|propagation]] caused by an updating parameter acting upon [[network node]]s.
# The multiverse automaton has a model consisting of informational substrate, an updating parameter, a few simple rules, and a method for deriving all of [[quantum field theory]] and general relativity theory,
# The totally finite nature of the model implies the existence of weird, [[Many-worlds interpretation|alternate-universe]] forces that might, or might not, be too small for empirical detection.
*[[Rudy Rucker]]. In his book ''Mind Tools'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;Rucker, Rudy, ''Mind Tools - the five levels of mathematical reality'' - Houghton Mifflin (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; mathematician/philosopher [[Rudy Rucker]] articulated this concept with the following conclusions about the relationship between Math and the universe. Rucker's second conclusion uses the [[jargon]] term 'fact-space' ; this is Rucker's [[scientific modelling|model]] of [[reality]] based on the notion that all that exists is the perceptions of various observers. An entity of any kind is a [[Glob (programming)|glob]] in fact-space. The world – the collection of all thoughts and objects – is a pattern spread out through fact-space. The following conclusions describe the digital philosophy that relates the world to fact-space.
# The world can be resolved into digital bits, with each bit made of smaller bits.
# These [[bit]]s form a [[fractal]] pattern in fact-space.
# The pattern behaves like a [[cellular automaton]].
# The pattern is inconceivably large in size and dimensions.
# Although the world started simply, its computation is irreducibly complex.

==Fredkin's ideas on physics==
Fredkin takes a radical approach to explaining the [[EPR paradox]] and the [[double-slit experiment]] in quantum mechanics. While admitting that quantum mechanics yields accurate predictions, [[Fredkin]] sides with [[Einstein]] in the [[Bohr-Einstein debates]]. In ''The Meaning of Relativity'', Einstein writes, "One can give good reasons why reality cannot at all be represented by a continuous [[Field theory (physics)|field]]. From the quantum phenomena it appears to follow with certainty that a finite system of finite energy can be completely described by a finite set of numbers ([[quantum numbers]]). This does not seem to be in accordance with a [[Spacetime|continuum theory]], and must lead to attempts to find a purely algebraic theory for the description of reality. However, nobody knows how to find the basis for such a description."

Einstein's hope is a purely algebraic theory; however, Fredkin attempts to find a purely informational theory for the description of reality. At the same time, physicists find some vagueness, problems with [[Bell theorem]] compatibility, and lack of empirical falsifiability in Fredkin's expression of his ideas. 
In "Digital Philosophy (DP)", Chapter 11,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalphilosophy.org/?page_id=12 |author=Fredkin, Edward |title=Digital Philosophy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928110706/http://www.digitalphilosophy.org/?page_id=12 |archivedate=2014-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredkin raises the question, "Could physics have a strong law of [[Reversible computing|conservation of information]]?" Fredkin answers his own question, "If so, we have to rethink [[Particle physics|particle disintegration]]s, [[inelastic collision]]s and [[Quantum Mechanics]] to better understand what is happening to the information. The appearance of a single truly [[Event (probability theory)|random event]] is absolutely incompatible with a strong law of [[Reversible computing|conservation of information]]. A great deal of information is obviously associated with the [[trajectory]] of every particle and that information must be conserved. This is a very large issue in DP, yet such issues are seldom considered in conventional [[physics]]."

==Fredkin's "five big questions with pretty simple answers"==
According to Fredkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3751/is_200401/ai_n9348128/|author=Fredkin, E.|title=Five big questions with pretty simple answers|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=48|issue=1|date=January 2004|doi=10.1147/rd.481.0031}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Digital mechanics predicts that for every continuous [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry of physics]] there will be some microscopic process that violates that symmetry." Therefore, according to Fredkin, at the [[Planck scale]], ordinary matter could have [[angular momentum operator|spin angular momentum]] that violates the [[equivalence principle]].There might be weird Fredkin [[force]]s that cause a [[Torsion tensor|torsion in spacetime]].

The [[Einstein-Cartan theory]] extends general relativity theory to deal with [[spin-orbit coupling]] when matter with spin is present. According to conventional wisdom in physics, torsion is nonpropagating, which means that torsion will appear within a massive body and nowhere else. According to Fredkin, torsion could appear outside and around massive bodies, because [[Many worlds interpretation|alternate universes]] have anomalous [[Inertia|inertial effects]].

'''Exoteric''' refers to knowledge that is outside, and independent from, a person's experience and can be ascertained by anyone (related to [[common sense]]). The word is derived from the comparative form of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἔξω ''eksô'', "from, out of, outside". It signifies anything which is public, without limits, or [[universalism|universal]]. It is distinguished from internal [[esoteric]] knowledge. "Exoteric" relates to external reality as opposed to a person's thoughts or feelings. It is knowledge that is public as opposed to [[secret]] or [[cabal]]istic.  It is not required that exoteric knowledge come easily or automatically, but it should be referenceable or reproducible.

== Philosophical context ==
Most philosophical and religious belief systems presume that reality must be independent of what an individual makes of it. However, even before the days of [[Plato]], a prominent alternate [[theory of knowledge]] insisted that the perceived outside reality is merely an internal fabrication of the observer and that it has no existence or substance outside the imagination of the observer. The Buddha's statement: "All that we are arises with our thoughts"  ([[Dhammapada]] 1.1) is reminiscent of this.

In his book entitled ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'', the Japanese swordsmaster [[Miyamoto Musashi]] noted that when he teaches people martial arts, "since [he] generally makes them learn such things as have actual relevance to addressing [deeper principles], there is no such thing as a distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric." &lt;ref&gt;Miyamoto Musashi. ''The Book of Five Rings.'' Translated by Thomas Cleary. Shambhala Library. Boston &amp; London. 2003. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious context ==
In the same way as the term "esoteric" is often associated with [[esotericism|esoteric spirituality]], the term "exoteric" is mostly used in discussions of religion and spirituality, as when the teachings shift the believer's focus away from an exploration of the inner self and towards an adherence to rules, laws, and an individual God.

The term "exoteric" may also reflect the notion of a divine identity that is outside of, and different from, human identity, whereas the esoteric notion claims that the divine is to be discovered ''within'' the human identity. Going one step further, the pantheistic notion suggests that the divine and the material world are one and the same.

==Government==
The exoteric form of government is one where all actions taken by the government must be both publicly disclosed and ratified by the public. This is often referred to as [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] of governance.

==Societies==
Many societies are divided into 2 sections—the ''exoteric'' or "public face" and the ''esoteric'' or "behind closed doors". Such are many [[fraternal organization]]s, such as [[Freemasonry]], which are at some level accessible to the uninitiated but which have higher and higher levels of initiation as one progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavron|first1=John T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8259">[[File:Fluctuating selection.png|380px|thumbnail|right|Alleles A and B fluctuate in [[fitness (biology)|adaptive value]] over time]]
'''Fluctuating selection''' is a mode of [[natural selection]] characterized by the fluctuation of the [[directional selection|direction of selection]] on a given [[phenotype]] over a relatively brief period of evolutionary time. For example, a species of plant may come in two varieties: one which prefers wetter soil and one which prefers dryer soil. During a period of wet years, the wet variety will be more [[fitness (biology)|fit]] and produce more offspring, and thereby increase the frequency of wet-preferring plants. If this wet period is followed by drought, the dry variety will be selected for and its numbers will increase. As periods of dryness and wetness fluctuate, so too does selection on dry-preferring and wet-preferring plants. Fluctuating selection is also manifest at the genic level. Consider two [[allele]]s, A and B, which are found at the same [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. Fluctuating selection dynamics are at play when selection favors A at time t&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, B at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A again at t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Fluctuating selection has been characterized by several [[mathematical model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Such models have led to the identification of fluctuating selection dynamics in [[population genetics|evolving populations]] from a broad range of [[taxon|taxa]], including [[bacteria]], [[eukaryotes]] and [[viruses]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Fluctuating Optimum (Psychology) ==
Fluctuating optimum is the same basis as fluctuating selection but in the context of [[Personality|Personality Theory]]. It's the idea that hereditary characteristic traits will not always balance, but change in favor of time or environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987583452|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=C.,|first=Ashton, Michael|isbn=9780128098455|edition=3rd|oclc=987583452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits can change based on harsh environments and also based on accepted behaviors in certain time periods. 

==Red Queen dynamics and the maintenance of sex==
The [[Red Queen hypothesis]] describes [[Evolutionary arms race|coevolutionary 'arms races']] between antagonistic species (predators and prey, parasites and hosts, competitors with overlapping [[ecological niche|niches]]), emphasizing competition between species and populations rather than within them. Under Red Queen dynamics, a species must adapt to shifting selection pressures of the ever-changing biota which constitute its environment or face extinction. Experiments in Red Queen environments on real and [[ecosystem model|simulated populations]] have offered strong support for the maintenance of [[sexual reproduction]] despite the [[evolution of sexual reproduction#two-fold cost of sex|two-fold cost of sex]].&lt;ref name = "Hamilton, Axelrod, Tanese"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluctuating selection may also play an important role in host-parasite coevolutionary relationships, specifically in the maintenance of sex. It has been shown that coevolutionary arms race dynamics between host and parasite give way to fluctuating selection dynamics in a minimal environment.&lt;ref name = "Host-parasite fluctuating selection" /&gt; Fluctuating selection in Red Queen environments has been suggested as an explanation for the persistence of sex:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The essence of sex in our theory is that it stores genes that are currently bad but have promise for reuse. It continually tries them in combination, waiting for the time when the focus of disadvantage has moved elsewhere. When this has happened, the genotypes carrying such genes spread by successful reproduction, becoming simultaneously stores for other bad genes and thus onward in continuous succession.&lt;ref name = "Hamilton, Axelrod, Tanese" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this conception of sex, the population is a storehouse of variation and sex is a mechanism for distributing old, minority variants once they become useful. This theory depends on fluctuating selection, as fluctuating selection dynamics make adaptive previously maladaptive variants due to ecological shifts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4871">'''Frank Noel Sibley''' (28 February 1923 – 18 February 1996) was a British philosopher who worked mainly in the field of [[aesthetics]]. He held the first Chair of [[Philosophy]] at [[Lancaster University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/676714142|title=The Continuum encyclopedia of British philosophy|last=|first=|date=2006|publisher=Thoemmes Continuum|others=Grayling, A. C., Pyle, Andrew., Goulder, Naomi.|year=|isbn=9781843711414|location=Bristol|pages=|chapter=Sibley, Frank Noel|oclc=676714142}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Lancaster University|.]] Sibley is best known for his 1959 paper "Aesthetic Concepts" (''[[Philosophical review|Philosophical Review]]'', 68), and for "Seeking, Scrutinizing and Seeing" (''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', 64, 1954). Both papers (and some others) have been anthologized, "Aesthetic Concepts" multiple times. 

Sibley has been considered an important contributor to Aesthetics in the analytical tradition. His collected papers, including some posthumous, were published by Oxford University Press in 2001 as ''Approach To Aesthetics'', together with a companion volume of critical and evaluative essays on his work.

He was the uncle of the writer and broadcaster [[Brian Sibley]].

== Philosophical work==

===Aesthetics===
Most of Sibley's work in aesthetics is collected in ''Approach to Aesthetics''. He is especially well known for his attempts to distinguish the domains of aesthetic and non-aesthetic. His 1959 paper "Aesthetic Concepts" is often referred as one of the landmarks of 20th century aesthetics in the tradition of analytic philosophy. The paper is rich in themes, but the main line of thought suggests that aesthetic concepts cannot be reduced to non-aesthetic concepts, or sufficiently defined in terms of non-aesthetic concepts. This leads Sibley to think that grasping properties of given items requires the capability to exercise taste or aesthetic sensibility. 

Topics and problems relating to taste thus became very important to Sibley's approach, and he returned to them through his career. Also, Sibley did not see Aesthetics as remote from philosophy as whole. This is very clear from his brief programmatic note "About Taste", published in 1966 in ''[[British Journal of Aesthetics]]''. Here Sibley states the situation thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The programme that aestheticians must face is thus a large one, the charting of a huge areas neglected by other philosophers working within their customary bonds. Indeed, far from it's([[sic]]) being true that aesthetics is peripheral to philosophy, aestheticians encounter ranges of concepts wider than and inevitably including of those studied by most other branches of philosophy."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Philosophy of mind===

Beside aesthetics, Sibley worked on the [[philosophy of perception]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. His first published paper was a long review of [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s Concept of Mind in 1950. Later he contributed another piece on Ryle, "Ryle and Thinking", to ''Ryle: Collection of Essays''.

He wrote two papers on the theory of perception, and some papers on the borderline of that field and aesthetics, one paper on colours, and a little piece on applied philosophy. One posthumous paper deals extensively with a certain distinction made by [[Peter Geach]]. Other than these, his work was in aesthetics.

''Gnosis'' is used throughout Greek philosophy as a technical term for experience knowledge (see [[gnosiology]]) in contrast to theoretical knowledge or [[epistemology]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The term is also related to the study of knowledge retention or memory (see also [[cognition]]), in relation to [[ontic]] or [[ontological]], which is how something actually is rather than how something is captured ([[abstraction]]) and stored ([[Anamnesis (philosophy)|memory]]) in the mind.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Judeo-Christian usage==

===Hellenistic Jewish literature===
The Greek word ''gnosis'' (knowledge) is used as a standard translation of the Hebrew word "knowledge" (דעת da'ath) in the [[Septuagint]], thus:
{{quote|The Lord gives wisdom [''ħokhma''] (''[[Sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]''), from his face come knowledge [''da'ath'']  (''gnosis'') and understanding [''tevuna''] (''[[synesis]]'')"|Proverbs 2.6}}
[[Philo]] also refers to the "knowledge" (''gnosis'') and "wisdom" (''sophia'') of God.&lt;ref&gt;New Testament studies: Society for New Testament Studies - 1981 "see also the more extensive analysis of gnosis in Philo by Hans Jonas, Gnosis und spatantiker Geist 11/1"&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
Paul distinguishes "knowledge" (''gnosis'') and "knowledge falsely so-called" (''pseudonymos gnosis'').

===In the writings of the Greek Fathers===
The [[Early Church Fathers|fathers of early Christianity]] used the word "knowledge" (''gnosis'') in the New Testament to mean spiritual knowledge or specific knowledge of the divine. This positive usage was to contrast it with how gnostic sectarians used the word. This positive use carried over from [[Plato|Hellenic philosophy]] into [[Greek Orthodoxy]] as a critical characteristic of [[ascetic]] practices, through [[Clement of Alexandria|St. Clement]] of Alexandria, [[Irenaeus]], [[Hippolytus of Rome]], [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]], and [[Origen]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===In Eastern Orthodox thought===
Gnosis in [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christian]] (primarily [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]) thought is the spiritual knowledge of a [[saint]] (one who has obtained [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]])&lt;ref&gt;"Spiritual knowledge is the state of spiritual [[theoria]], when one sees invisibly and hears inaudibly and comprehends incomprehensibly the glory of God. Precisely then comprehension ceases and, what is more, he understands that he does not understand. Within the vision of the uncreated Light man also sees angels and Saints and, in general, he experiences communion with the angels and the Saints. He is then certain that resurrection exists. This is the spiritual knowledge which all the holy Prophets, the Apostles, Martyrs, ascetics and all the Saints of the Church had. The teachings of the Saints are an offspring of this spiritual knowledge. And, naturally, as we said earlier, spiritual knowledge is a fruit of the vision of God. "THE ILLNESS AND CURE OF THE SOUL" Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos [http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b05.en.the_illness_and_cure_of_the_soul.04.htm#kno1]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[mysticism|mystically enlightened]] human being. Within the cultures of the term's provenance ([[Byzantine]] and [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]]) ''Gnosis'' was a knowledge or [[insight]] into the infinite, divine and uncreated in all and above all,&lt;ref&gt;[[Saint Symeon the New Theologian|St. Symeon the New Theologian]] in Practical &amp; Theological Discourses, 1.1 The [[Philokalia]] Volume Four: When men search for God with their bodily eyes they find Him nowhere, for He is invisible. But for those who ponder in the Spirit He is present everywhere. He is in all, yet beyond all&lt;/ref&gt; rather than knowledge strictly into the finite, natural or material world.&lt;ref&gt;Faith And Science In Orthodox Gnosiology And Methodology by [[George Metallinos]]
"The scientist and professor of the knowledge of the Uncreated, in the Orthodox Tradition, is the Geron/[[Starets]] (the Elder or Spiritual Father), the guide or "teacher of the desert." The recording of both types of knowledge presupposes empirical knowledge of the phenomenon.
The same holds true in the field of science, where only the specialist understands the research of other scientists of the same field. The adoption of conclusions or findings of a scientific branch by non-specialists (i.e. those who are unable to experimentally examine the research of the specialists) is based on the trust of the specialists credibility. Otherwise, there would be no scientific progress.
The same holds true for the science of faith. The empirical knowledge of the Saints, Prophets, Apostles, Fathers and Mothers of all ages is adopted and founded upon the same trust. The patristic tradition and the Church's Councils function on this provable experience. There is no Ecumenical Council without the presence of the glorified/deified (theoumenoi), those who see the divine (this is the problem of the councils of today!) Orthodox doctrine results from this relationship."

==Gnosticism==
{{Main|Gnosticism}}

Gnosticism originated in the late first century CE in nonrabbinical Jewish sects and early Christian sects.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515-3516}} In the formation of Christianity, various [[sectarian]] groups, labeled "gnostics" by their opponents, emphasised spiritual knowledge (''gnosis'') of the Divine spark within, over [[faith]] (''pistis'') in the teachings and traditions of the various communities of Christians.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social World of the First Christians'' (1995) {{ISBN|0-06-064586-5}}, essay "Prolegomena to the Study of Ancient Gnosticism" by [[Bentley Layton]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=GC4vwTXJSaMC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=Layton,+Bentley.+%22Prolegomena+to+the+Study+of+Ancient+Gnosticism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2q7dTd3LJcra0QHd7bmyCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Layton%2C%20Bentley.%20%22Prolegomena%20to%20the%20Study%20of%20Ancient%20Gnosticism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Gnosticism presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God, and the [[demiurge]] “creator” of the material universe. The Gnostics considered the most [[Essential property|essential]] part of the process of [[salvation]] to be this personal knowledge, in contrast to faith as an outlook in their [[Perspective (cognitive)|world view]] along with faith in the [[ecclesiastical]] authority. They were regarded as [[heresy|heretics]] by the [[Early Church Fathers|Fathers of the early church]].

{{more footnotes|date=February 2008}}
In [[mereology]], an area of [[philosophical logic]], the term '''gunk''' applies to any whole whose parts all have further proper parts. That is, a gunky object is not made of indivisible ''atoms'' or ''[[simple (philosophy)|simples]]''.  Because parthood is transitive, any part of gunk is itself gunk.

If point-sized objects are always simple, then a gunky object does not have any point-sized parts. By usual accounts of gunk, such as [[Alfred Tarski]]'s in 1929, three-dimensional gunky objects also do not have other degenerate parts shaped like one-dimensional curves or two-dimensional surfaces. (See also ''[[Whitehead's point-free geometry]]''.)

Gunk is an important test case for accounts of the composition of material objects: for instance, Ted Sider has challenged [[Peter van Inwagen]]'s account of composition because it is inconsistent with the possibility of gunk. Sider's argument also applies to a simpler view than van Inwagen's: mereological ''nihilism'', the view that only material simples exist. If nihilism is [[logical truth|necessarily true]], then gunk is impossible. But, as Sider argues, because gunk is both conceivable and possible, nihilism is false, or at best a contingent truth.

Gunk has also played an important role in the history of [[topology]]&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Dean (editor) Oxford Studies in Metaphysics: Volume 4 (Oup Oxford 2008) Arntzenius, Frank "Gunk, Topology and Measure"&lt;/ref&gt; in recent debates concerning change, contact, and the structure of physical [[space]]. The composition of space and the composition of material objects are related by ''receptacles''—regions of space that could harbour a material object. (The term receptacles was coined by Richard Cartwright (Cartwright 1975).) It seems reasonable to assume that if space is gunky, a receptacle is gunky and then a material object is possibly gunky.

The term was first used by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] in his work ''Parts of Classes'' (1991). Dean W. Zimmerman defends the possibility of atomless gunk (1996b). See also Hud Hudson (2007).

== History ==
Arguably, discussions of material gunk run all the way back to at least Aristotle and possibly as far back as Anaxagoras, and include such thinkers as William of Ockham, René Descartes, and Alfred Tarski.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sider|first=Theodore|year=1993|title=Van Inwagen and the Possibility of Gunk|url=|journal=Analysis|volume=53|pages=285-259|via=|doi=10.2307/3328252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Dean|year=1996|title=Could Extended Objects Be Made Out of Simple Parts?: An Argument for "Atomless Gunk"|url=|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=56|pages=1–29|doi=10.2307/2108463}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first contemporary mentionings of gunk is found in the writings of A. N. Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, and later in the writings of David Lewis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Elements of gunk thought are present in Zeno's famous paradoxes of plurality. Zeno argued that if there were such things as discrete instants of time, then objects can never move through time. Aristotle's solution to Zeno's paradoxes involves the idea that time is not made out of durationless instants, but ever smaller temporal intervals. Every interval of time can be divided into smaller and smaller intervals, without ever terminating in some privileged set of durationless instants.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arntzenius|first=Frank|year=2011|title=Gunk, Topology, and Measure|url=|journal=The Western Ontario Series in Philosophy of Science|volume=75|pages=327–343|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, motion is possible because time is gunky. Despite having been a relatively common position in metaphysics, after Cantor's discovery of the distinction between denumerable and non-denumerable infinite cardinalities, and mathematical work by Adolf Grünbaum, gunk theory was no longer seen as a necessary alternative to a topology of space made out of points.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recent mathematical work in the topology of spacetime by scholars such as Peter Roeper and Frank Arntzenius have reopened the question of whether a gunky spacetime is a feasible framework for doing physics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roeper|first=Peter|year=1997|title=Region-Based Topology|url=|journal=Journal of Philosophical Logic|volume=26|pages=251–309|via=|doi=10.1023/a:1017904631349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly the most influential formulation of a theory of gunky spacetime comes from A. N. Whitehead in his seminal work ''Process and Reality''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Process and Reality|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|publisher=The Free Press|year=1978|orig-year=1927|isbn=0-02-934580-4|location=New York, NY|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead argues that there are no point regions of space and that every region of space has some three dimensional extension. Under a Whiteheadian conception of spacetime, points, lines, planes, and other less-than-three-dimensional objects are constructed out of a method of "extensive abstraction", in which points, lines, and planes are identified with infinitely converging abstract sets of nested extended regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The possibility of gunk ==
Many, such as Ted Sider (1993) have argued that even the possibility of gunk undermines another position, that of [[mereological nihilism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sider's argument is as follows:

# Nihilism is either necessarily true, or necessarily false. 
# Gunk is metaphysically possible.
# If gunk is metaphysically possible, the nihilism is not necessarily true.
# Therefore, nihilism is necessarily false.

This argument is interesting because all it turns upon is whether or not gunk is even possible, not whether or not the actual world is a gunky one. Sider defends 1) by appealing to the fact that since nihilism is a metaphysical thesis, it must be true or false of necessity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In defense of 2), Sider argues that since a gunk world is conceivable; that is, we can imagine a gunky world without any internal contradiction, the gunk must be possible. 3) Follows from an understanding of necessity and possibility that stems from an understanding of possible world semantics. Simply put, a proposition P is necessarily false if and only if it is false in all possible world, and ff a proposition P is possible, if and only if it is true is at least one possible world. Thus, if a proposition is possible, then it is not necessarily false, as it is not false in all possible worlds. 4) Follows deductively from the other premises.

Sider's argument is valid, so most strategies to resist the argument have focused on denying one or more of his premises. Strategies that deny 1) have been called the "contingency defense". Deniers of 1) say that the facts that determine the composition of objects are not necessary facts, but can differ in different possible worlds. As such, nihilism is a contingent matter of fact, and the possibility of gunk does not undermine the possibility of nihilism. This is the strategy endorsed by Cameron (2007) and Miller (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Ross|year=2007|title=The Contingency of Composition|url=|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=136|pages=99–121|via=|doi=10.1007/s11098-007-9144-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Kristie|year=2010|title=The Existential Quanitifier, Composition and Contingency|url=|journal=Erkenntnis|volume=73|pages=211–235|via=|doi=10.1007/s10670-010-9250-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, one could deny 2) and say that gunk is metaphysically impossible. Most strategies that take this route deny 2) in virtue of denying another relatively common intuition: that conceivability entails metaphysical possibility. Although this metaphysical principle dates back to at least the works of Descartes, recent work by philosophers such as Marcus (2004) and Roca-Royes (2010) have shed some doubt on the reliability of conceivability as a guide to metaphysical possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Eric|year=2004|title=Why Zombies Are Inconceivable|url=|journal=Australian Journal of Philosophy|volume=82|pages=477–490|via=|doi=10.1080/713659880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roca-Royes|first=Sonia|year=2010|title=Conceivability and De Re Modal Knowledge|url=|journal=Nous|volume=45|pages=22–49|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00757.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans D. Sluga''' ({{IPA-de|ˈsluːga|lang}}; born April 24, 1937) is a [[Germany|German]] academic, who has served as a lecturer in philosophy at [[University College London]] and is now a professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he has taught since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/people/page/37&lt;/ref&gt;  He teaches and writes on topics in [[analytic philosophy]] as well as on political philosophy and has been particularly influenced by the thought of [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Michel Foucault]].

==Education== 
He studied at the [[University of Bonn]] and the [[University of Munich]]. He subsequently obtained a BPhil&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;[http://philosophy.berkeley.edu/sluga/ Sluga's homepage at Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where he studied under [[R. M. Hare]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Gilbert Ryle]] and [[Michael Dummett]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://french-italian.stanford.edu/opinions/sluga.html Sluga's webpage at Stanford]&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his philosophical orientation as follows: "My overall philosophical outlook is radically historicist. I believe that we can understand ourselves only as beings with a particular evolution and history."&lt;ref name="berkeley" /&gt;

==Philosophical work==

Sluga has worked extensively on the early history of analytic philosophy. In his writings on [[Gottlob Frege]] he has sought to establish the influence of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Hermann Lotze]], and of Neo-Kantians like Cuno Fischer and [[Wilhelm Windelband]] on Frege's views on the foundations of mathematics and in the theory of meaning. This historically oriented approach to Frege's thought brought him into sharp conflict with Michael Dummett's "realist" interpretation of Frege. Sluga's work in analytic philosophy has been influenced substantially by his engagement with Wittgenstein to whose early and late writings he has devoted a number of studies. His writings on both Frege and Wittgenstein have contributed to the development of the study of the history of analytic philosophy as a field within analytic philosophy.

Since the early 1990s Sluga has become increasingly concerned with political philosophy. In ''Heidegger's Crisis'' he set out to explore the question why philosophers from Plato till the present get so often entangled in dangerous political affairs. Sluga analyzes Heidegger's political engagement by putting it into the larger context of the development of German philosophy in the Nazi period. He seeks to show thereby that many diagnoses of Heidegger's politics are misdirected because of their overly narrow focus on the person and work of Heidegger. He challenges, in particular, the claim that Heidegger's critique of reason is to blame for his political errors by pointing out that committed "rationalists" among the German philosophers were prone to the same errors. Sluga's book seeks to show that the willingness to involve themselves politically not only Heidegger, but also of Neo-Kantians like Bruno Bauch, Neo-Fichteans like Max Wundt, and Nietzscheans like Alfred Baeumler was ultimately due to their misconceived belief that they were living through a moment of world-historical crisis in which they were particularly called upon to intervene.

His book ''Politics and the Search for the Common Good'' seeks to re-think politics in substantially new terms. Sluga distinguishes in it between a long tradition of "normative political theorizing" that ranges from [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] through Kant to contemporary writers like [[John Rawls]] and a more recent form of "diagnostic practice" that emerged in the 19th century and whose first practitioners were [[Karl Marx]] and Friedrich Nietzsche. Diagnostic political philosophy, Sluga argues, does not seek to establish political norms through a process of abstract philosophical reasoning but seeks to reach practical conclusions through a careful diagnosis of the political realities. Identifying himself with this strand of political philosophizing, Sluga proceeds to examine the thinking of [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and Michel Foucault as 20th century exemplars of the diagnostic approach. The book seeks to highlight the promise and the achievements of the diagnostic method as well as its shortcomings so far and its inherent limitations. In doing so, Sluga maps out an understanding of politics that makes use of some of Wittgenstein's methodological concepts. He characterizes politics as a family resemblance phenomenon and argues that the concept of politics does not identify a natural kind. It is therefore also mistaken to assume that there is a single common good at which all politics aims. Similarly, we must forgo the belief that there is a best form of government (as, e.g., democracy). Politics must, rather, be conceived as a continuous search for a common good which can have no final, conclusive answer. It is a sphere of uncertainty in which we operate always with a radically incomplete and unreliable picture of where we are and with only shifting ideas of where we want to go. The institutional forms that this search takes will change over time. Sluga agrees with other diagnostic thinkers that the classical institution of the modern state is now giving way to a new form of political order which he calls "the corporāte," whose challenges are defined by the growth of human populations, rapid technological changes, and an ever more pressing environmental crisis.

'''Sir Henry Jones''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|CH|FBA|size=100%}} (30 November 1852 &amp;ndash; 4 February 1922) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] philosopher and academic.

==Biography==
Jones was born in [[Llangernyw]], now in [[Conwy County Borough]], the son of a shoemaker.  After working as an apprentice to his father, he studied at [[Bangor Normal College]] and became a teacher at [[Brynamman]].  Having decided to enter the Presbyterian ministry, he went to the [[University of Glasgow]] on a scholarship.  After graduating, he obtained a fellowship, and went on to study at Oxford and in Germany.  In 1882 he married a Scotswoman, and later returned to live in Scotland.

He was instrumental in the passing of the Intermediate Education Act of 1889, and worked for the establishment of the [[University of Wales]] and the introduction of a penny rate for education.  He was knighted in 1912. He was appointed [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]] in 1922, shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32563|date=31 December 1921|page=10716|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heloise World Noted Women.jpg|thumb|Héloïse imagined in a mid-19th-century engraving]]
'''Héloïse''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|oʊ|.|iː|z}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|l|oʊ|.|iː|z}}; {{IPA-fr|e.lɔ.iz|lang}}; 1090?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clanchy|first=Michael|title=Abelard: A Medieval Life|year=1997|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford and Malden, MA|pages=173–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;/1100–1?&lt;ref name="HC"/&gt; – 16 May 1164) was a French [[nun]], writer, scholar, and [[abbess]], best known for her love affair and correspondence with [[Peter Abelard|Peter Abélard]].

Héloïse is accorded an important place in French literary history and in the development of feminist representation. While few of her letters survive, those that do have been considered a foundational "monument" of French literature from the late thirteenth century onwards. Her correspondence, more erudite than it is erotic, is the Latin basis for the ''bildungsroman'' and a model of the classical epistolary genre, and which influenced writers as diverse as Madame de Lafayette, Laclos, Rousseau and Dominique Aury. 

== Background ==
Héloïse (variously spelled Helöise, Héloyse, Hélose, Heloisa, Helouisa, Eloise, and Aloysia, among other variations; the name is derived from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*Hailawidis'', "holy wood") was a brilliant scholar of [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Bonnie G.|title=The Oxford encyclopedia of women in world history, Volume 1|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Heloise|isbn=0-19-514890-8|page=445|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA445&amp;dq=abelard+forced+sex+on+heloise#v=onepage&amp;q=abelard%20forced%20sex%20on%20heloise&amp;f=false |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a reputation for intelligence and insight. Abélard writes that she was ''nominatissima'', "most renowned" for her gift in reading and writing. Not a great deal is known of her immediate family except that in her letters she implies she is of a lower social standing (probably the Garlande family, who had money and several members in strong positions) than was Abélard, who was originally from the [[nobility]], though he had rejected knighthood to be a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matheson|first=Lister M|title=Icons of the Middle Ages: Rulers, Writers, Rebels, and Saints|year=2011|location=Abelard's Early life and Education|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bG0qYe0ia6sC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Abelard+rejected+knighthood#v=onepage&amp;q=Abelard%20rejected%20knighthood&amp;f=false|isbn=9781573567800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is known is that she was the ward of an uncle, a [[canon (priest)|canon]] in Paris named Fulbert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Andrew|title=Great Philosophers Who Failed at Love|year=2011|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=0-06-196981-8|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XSgN_rOA6vIC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Heloise+d'Argenteuil#v=onepage&amp;q=Heloise%20d'Argenteuil&amp;f=false |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some point in her life, she was renowned throughout Western Europe for her scholarship. By the time she became the student of Pierre Abélard (Peter Abelard), who was one of the most popular teachers and philosophers in Paris, she was already a reputed scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaffer|2011|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educated by Abelard in medicine and other traditional subjects taught in higher education at the time, Héloïse gained quite a reputation as a physician in her role as abbess of Paraclete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Barbara|last1=Smith Shearer |first2=Benjamin F.|last2=Shearer |title=Notable women in the life sciences : a biographical dictionary|date=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0-313-29302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical events ==
[[File:Abelard and Heloise.jpeg|thumb|Abaelardus and Héloïse in the manuscript ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'' (14th century)]]
In his ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'', an autobiographical piece written around 1132, Abélard tells the story of his seduction of Héloïse, whom he met when in 1115 he himself, like Fulbert, became a canon in Paris.

It is unclear how old Héloïse was at this time. She is described as an ''adolescentula ''(young girl), and so it is often assumed that she was about seventeen at the time and therefore born in 1100–1.&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;''Historia Calamitatum'', in Betty Radice, trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, Constant Mews has suggested that the age of seventeen is a seventeenth-century fabrication with no supporting contemporary evidence, and that she was probably in her early twenties when she met Abelard.&lt;ref&gt;Constant J Mews, ''Abelard and Heloise'', (Oxford, 2005), p59&lt;/ref&gt; The main support for this is that in a later letter, Peter the Venerable writes to Héloïse that he remembers her when he was a young man and she was a woman. Given that Peter the Venerable was born in 1092, it suggests that Héloïse would have been in her early twenties.  Mews proposes that this makes more sense of Abelard's later comment that he sought to seduce Héloïse because she was the most famous woman in France for her studies, because it is unlikely that she would have acquired this reputation or her command of Greek and Hebrew by the age of seventeen. 

Abelard tells how he convinced Fulbert to let him move into his house, telling Fulbert that he could not afford to live in his current house while studying, and offering to tutor Héloïse in return.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Calamitatum'', in Betty Radice, trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), p67&lt;/ref&gt; Abelard tells of their subsequent illicit relationship, which they continued until Héloïse became pregnant. Abelard moved Héloïse away from Fulbert and sent her to his own sister in Brittany, where Héloïse gave birth to a boy, whom she called Astrolabe (which is also the name of a [[Astrolabe|navigational device]] that is used to determine a position on Earth by charting the position of the stars).&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Calamitatum'', in Betty Radice, trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), p69&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost unknown what happened to Astrolabe in later life. He is never mentioned by Héloïse in her letters to Abelard, and Abelard's only reference to him outside the  ''Historia Calamitatum'' is in the verses of advice addressed to him, and thought to have been written about 1135. His death-day is recorded in the necrology of the Paraclete as 29 or 30 October, but no year is given. He is mentioned only once in a later letter, when [[Peter the Venerable]] writes to Héloïse: "I will gladly do my best to obtain a [[prebend]] in one of the great churches for your Astrolabe, who is also ours for your sake".&lt;ref&gt;Betty Radice (trans.), ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

Abelard agreed to marry Héloïse to appease Fulbert, although on the condition that the marriage should be kept secret so as not to damage Abélard's career. The reason for wanting the marriage to remain secret is not entirely clear. The most likely explanation is that Abelard must have been in Orders (something on which scholarly opinion is divided), and given that the church was just beginning to forbid marriage to priests and the higher orders of clergy, public marriage would have been a bar to Abelard's advancement in the church. Héloïse was initially reticent to agree to the secret marriage, but was eventually persuaded by Abelard.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Calamitatum,'' in Betty Radice, trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), pp 70-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Héloïse returned from Brittany, and the couple were secretly married in Paris.

Fulbert, however, began to spread news of the marriage, in order to punish Abelard for the damage done to his reputation. Héloïse attempted to deny this, but this ongoing situation eventually caused Abélard to place Héloïse for her own safety in the [[convent]] of [[Argenteuil]], where Héloïse had been brought up. Fulbert and his friends, however, believed that Abelard had simply found a way of getting rid of Héloïse, by making her a nun. So, to punish Abelard, a group of Fulbert's friends broke into Abelard's room one night and castrated him.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Calamitatum'', in Betty Radice,trans, ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'', (Penguin, 1974), p75&lt;/ref&gt;

After castration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abelard|first=Peter|title=The letters and other writings|year=2007|publisher=Hackett Pub Co|isbn=0-87220-875-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REPM2edtbfsC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=abelard+castration#v=onepage&amp;q=abelard%20castration&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; filled with shame at his situation, Abélard became a [[monk]] in the [[Abbey of St. Denis|Abbey of St Denis]] in Paris. At the convent in [[Argenteuil]], Héloïse took the [[Religious habit|habit]] at Abelard's insistence and much against her own wishes. She eventually became [[prioress]] there, but she and the other nuns were turned out in 1129 when the convent was taken over by the Abbey of St Denis. At this point Abélard arranged for them to enter the [[Oratory of the Paraclete]], a deserted building near [[Nogent-sur-Seine]] in [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]] which had been established by Abelard himself in 1122 (though he had subsequently moved to become Abbot of [[Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys]] in Lower Brittany). Héloïse became [[abbess]] of the new community of nuns there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosser|first=Sue Vilhauer|title=Women, science, and myth: gender beliefs from antiquity to the present|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-095-7|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OB4OgT8OH7sC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=heloise+became+an+abesse#v=onepage&amp;q=heloise%20became%20an%20abesse&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Correspondence ==
About this time, correspondence began between the two former lovers. What exists today consists of seven letters (numbered ''Epistolae ''2–8 in Latin volumes, since the ''Historia Calamitatum'' precedes them as ''Epistola'' 1). Four of the letters (''Epistolae ''2–5) are known as the 'Personal Letters', and contain personal correspondence. The remaining three (''Epistolae ''6–8) are known as the 'Letters of Direction'.

Héloïse responded, both on the behalf of the Paraclete and herself. In letters which followed, Héloïse expressed dismay at problems that Abélard faced, but scolded him for years of silence following the attack upon him, since Abélard was still wed to Héloïse.

Thus began a correspondence both passionate and erudite. Héloïse encouraged Abélard in his philosophical work, and he dedicated his profession of faith to her. Abélard insisted that he had never truly loved her, but only [[lust]]ed after her, and that their relationship was a sin against God. He then recommended her to turn her attention toward the only one who ever truly loved her, [[Jesus Christ]], and to consecrate herself fully from then on to her religious vocation.

At this point the tenor of the letters changes. In the 'Letters of Direction', Héloïse writes the fifth letter, declaring that she will no longer speak of the hurt that Abelard has caused her. The sixth is a long letter by Abelard in response to Héloïse's first question in the fifth letter about the origin of nuns. In the long final, seventh letter, Abelard provides a rule for the nuns at the Oratory of the Paraclete, again as requested by Héloïse at the outset of the fifth letter.

The ''Problemata Heloissae'' (Héloïse's Problems) is a letter from Héloïse to Abélard containing 42 questions about difficult passages in Scripture, interspersed with Abelard's answers to the questions, probably written at the time when she was abbess at the Paraclete.

== Her legacy ==
Beyond the love story they tell, Héloïse's letters contribute one of the earliest, most radical feminist philosophies of not only the 12th century, but even of today. 

Héloïse plainly writes of her disdain for marriage and even feminine life, stating in her first letter, "I preferred love to [[Marriage|wedlock]], freedom to a bond."&lt;ref name="FU"&gt;Fordham University. [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/heloise1.asp#first "Medieval Sourcebook Heloise: Letter to Abelard."] Accessed
8 October 2014. &lt;/ref&gt; 
She is also later quoted with her famous lines, "What man, bent on sacred or philosophical thoughts, could endure the crying of children…? And what woman will be able to bear the constant filth and squalor of babies?"&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{clarify |text=Newman, Barbara. Review of The Letter Collection of Peter Abelard and Heloise edited by David Luscombe Oxford. |reason=Which parts are the title, name of the editor, and publisher or location? This ref must actually be consulted in order to have a verifiable structure. |date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She goes so far as to define marriage as the ultimate form of prostitution, a brash statement for a female in 12th century France. She states, 
"Assuredly, whomsoever this [[concupiscence]] leads into marriage deserves payment rather than affection; for it is evident that she goes after his wealth and not the man, and is willing to prostitute herself, if she can, to a richer."&lt;ref name="FU" /&gt;

Although her exceptional and different "pure love" for Peter Abelard provides the contextual backdrop for her brash statements, she is essentially calling marriage contractual prostitution. It is clear that Héloïse meant for this philosophy to be heard because Peter Abelard himself reproduces her arguments in The Story of His Calamities.&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt;

== Influence on Literature ==

Héloïse is accorded an important place in French literary history and in the development of feminist representation. While few of her letters survive, those that do have been considered a foundational "monument" of French literature from the late thirteenth century onwards. Her correspondance, more erudite than it is erotic, is the Latin basis for the [[Bildungsroman]] and a model of the classical epistolary genre, and which influenced writers as diverse as [[Madame de Lafayette]], [[Laclos]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Dominique Aury]]. 

=== Early Development of the Myth ===

* [[Jean de Meun]], the first translator of Héloïse's work, is also the first person, in around 1290, to quote, in the [[Roman de la Rose]] (verses 8729 to 8802), the myth of Héloïse and Abelard, which must have meant that her work was sufficiently popular in order for the readership to understand the allusion.
* In around 1337, [[Petrarch]] acquired a copy of the Correspondance, which already included the Historia calamitatum (translated by Jean de Meun). Petrarch added many notes to the manuscrit before starting to compose in the following year a [[Chansonnier]] dedicated to [[Laura de Noves|Laure de Sade]].
* The Breton lament song ([[Gwerz]]) titled ''Loiza ac Abalard'' sings of the ancient druidess picking 'golden grass' with the features of a sorceress-alchemist known as Héloïse. This spread a popular tradition, perhaps originating in [[Rhuys]], Brittany, and going as far as [[Naples]]. This text and its later tradition associated magic with [[rationalism]], which remained an important component of Abelardian theology as it was perceived until the twentieth century.
* In 1583, the [[Oratory of the Paraclete|Abbey of Paraclet]], heavily damaged during the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]], was deserted by its monastic residents who disagreed with the [[Huguenot]] sympathies of their mother superior. The Abbess Marie de la Rochefoucauld, named by [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] to the position in 1599 in spite of opposition from [[Pope Clement VIII]], set to work on restoring the prestige of the establishment and organised the cult of Héloïse and Abelard.

=== Early Modern Period ===

* Following a first Latin edition, that of [[André Duchesne|Duchesne]] dated to 1616, the Comte de [[Bussy-Rabutin|Bussy Rabutin]], as part of his epistolary correspondence with his cousin the [[marquise de Sévigné]], sent her a very partial and unfaithful translation on 12 April 1687, a text which would be included in the posthumous collected works of the writer.
* [[Alexander Pope]], inspired by the English translation that the poet [[John Hughes (poet)|John Hughes]] made using the translation by Bussy Rabutin, brought the myth back into fashion when he published in 1717 the famous tragic poem [[Eloisa to Abelard]], which was intended as a [[pastiche]], but does not relate to the authentic letters. The original text was neglected and only the characters and the plot were used.
* Twenty years later, [[Pierre-François Godard de Beauchamps|Pierre-François Godard]] produced a French verse version of Bussy Rabutin's text.
* Jean-Jacques Rousseau drew on the reinvented figure in order to write [[Julie, or the New Heloise|Julie ou la Nouvelle Héloïse]], which his editor published in 1761 under the title Lettres des deux amans.
* In 1763, [[Charles-Pierre Colardeau]] loosely translated the version of the story imagined by Pope, which depicted Héloïse as a recluse writing to Abelard, and spread the sentimental version of the legend over the continent.
* An edition designed by [[André-Charles Cailleau]] and produced by the heiress of André Duchesne further spread amongst reading audiences a collection of these re-imaginings of the figure of Hélöise.

=== Romantic Period ===

* At the very beginning of the romantic period, in 1807, a [[neo-Gothic]] monument was constructed for Héloïse and Abelard and was transferred to the [[Cimetière de l'Est]] in Paris in 1817.
* In 1836, A. Creuzé de Lesser, the former Préfet of Montpellier, provided a translation of 'LI poèmes de la vie et des malheurs d'Eloïse et Aballard' which was published alongside his translation of the 'Romances du Cid'
* In 1836, the scholar [[Victor Cousin]] focused on Héloïse as part of his studies on Abelard.
* In 1839, [[François Guizot]], the former minister for public education, published the posthumous essay of his first wife, Pauline de Meulan, as a preface to the hugely-popular first edition of the Lettres d'Abailard et d'Héloïse, which were transposed rather than translated into French and in two volumes illustrated by [[Jean Gigoux]].
* In the same year, the colibri Héloïse (Atthis heloisa) is dedicated to her by the ornithologists [[René Primevère Lesson]] and [[Adolphe Delattre]].
* In 1845, [[Jean-Pierre Vibert]] created a species of rose named after Héloïse.
* Following the romantic tradition, [[Alphonse de Lamartine|Lamartine]] published in 1859 a version of Héloïse et Abélard.
* [[Charles de Rémusat]], a biographer of Abelard, wrote in 1877 a play based on the story of the medieval figures.

== Disputed issues ==
=== Attribution of works ===
The authorship of the writings connected with Héloïse has been a subject of scholarly disagreement for much of their history. 

The most well-established documents, and correspondingly those whose authenticity has been disputed the longest, are the series of letters that begin with Abelard's ''Historia Calamitatum'' (counted as letter 1) and encompass four "personal letters" (numbered 2-5) and "letters of direction" (numbers 6-8). Most scholars today accept these works as having been written by Héloïse and Abelard themselves, but some continue to disagree. John Benton is the most prominent modern sceptic of these documents. Etienne Gilson and Peter Dronke, on the other hand, have been particularly important proponents the mainstream view that the letters are genuine, both by offering explanations of the problems with the texts themselves and by arguing that the skeptical viewpoint is fueled in large part by its advocates' pre-conceived notions.&lt;ref&gt;David Wulstan, "'''Novi modulaminis melos:'' the music of Heloise and Abelard," ''Plainsong and Medieval Music'' 11 (2002): 1-2. {{doi|10.1017/S0961137102002012}}&lt;br&gt;For what the Epistoalae project at Columbia University calls "a sensible discussion of the problem," see Barbara Newman, "Authority, authenticity, and the repression of Heloise," ''Medieval and Renaissance Studies'' 22 (1992), 121-57. [http://monasticmatrix.osu.edu/sites/monasticmatrix.osu.edu/files/commentaria/primary_texts/mm-S4126-newmanm-authoritya.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, it has been argued that an anonymous series of letters, the ''Epistolae Duorum Amantium'', were in fact written by Héloïse and Abelard during their initial romance (and, thus, before the later and more broadly known series of letters). This argument has been advanced most forcefully by Constant J. Mews, based on earlier work by Ewad Könsgen. These letters represent a significant expansion to the corpus of surviving writing by Héloïse, and thus open several new directions for further scholarship. However, because the attribution "is of necessity based on circumstantial rather than on absolute evidence," it is not accepted by all scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epistolae.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/woman/28.html "Heloise, abbess of the Paraclete,"] in ''Epistoalae: Medieval Women's Latin Letters,'' ed. Joan M. Ferrante (Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning), published online&lt;/ref&gt;

There are similar scholarly disputes about other works attributed to Héloïse.

=== Relationship with Abelard ===
The great majority of scholars (as well as casual readers) have interpreted the story of Héloïse's relationship with Abelard as a tragic romance. However, in 1989, Mary Ellen Waithe argued that Héloïse was strongly opposed to a sexual relationship with Abelard; according to Waithe, she "withheld her consent [to sex] and physically and verbally resisted [Abelard's] advances to the best of her ability." Thus, in Waithe's view, Abelard's conduct amounted to abuse and rape.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen Waithe, "Heloise: Biography," in ''A History of Women Philosophers,'' vol. 2, ed. Mary Ellen Waithe (Boston: Nijhoff, 1989), 67 {{doi|10.1007/978-94-009-2551-9_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waithe's argument is based primarily on a sentence from the fifth letter, in which Abelard, in the context of arguing to Héloïse that their youthful sexual conduct was sinful and should be repented, not fondly recalled, writes: "When you objected to [sex] yourself and resisted with all your might, and tried to dissuade me from it, I frequently forced your consent (for after all you were the weaker) by threats and blows."&lt;ref&gt;trans. Etienne Gilson, qtd in Waithe (1989), 67&lt;/ref&gt;

While no other scholar has directly responded to Waithe's claim, other academics come to very different conclusions about the nature of Héloïse's relationship with Abelard. Their view is informed in large part by Héloïse's own writings (as opposed to Abelard's letters to her), in which she expresses a much more positive attitude toward their past relationship than does Abelard and does not "accept that his love for her could die, even by the horrible act of Abelard’s castration."&lt;ref&gt;Wulstan, "''Novi modulaminis melos''" 2&lt;/ref&gt; A more mainstream interpretation of those parts of Abelard's writing like the sentence Waithe finds so troubling is the one given by David Wulstan: "Much of what Abelard says in the Historia Calamitatum does not ring true: his arrogation of blame for the cold seduction of his pupil is hardly fortified by the letters of Heloise; this and various supposed violations seem contrived to build a farrago of supposed guilt which he must expiate by his retreat into monasticism and by distancing himself from his former lover."&lt;ref&gt;Wulstan, "''Novi modulaminis melos''" 2&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, even Waithe herself indicated in a 2009 interview with Karen Warren that she has "softened the position [she] took earlier" in light of Mews' subsequent attribution of the ''Epistolae Duorum Amantium'' to Abelard and Héloïse (which Waithe accepts), though she continues to find the passage troubling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Karen|title=An Unconventional History of Western Philosophy: Conversations Between Men and Women Philosophers|year=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Views on Love|isbn=0-7425-5924-6|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zJOQ52E4GMC&amp;ots=u4lqaL8rFV&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Levitan, fellow of the American academy in Rome, "Readers may be struck by the unattractive figure [the otherwise self praising Abelard] cuts in his own pages....Here the motive [in blaming himself for a cold seduction] is part protective...for Abelard to take all the moral burden on himself and shield, to the extent he can, the now widely respected abbess of the Paraclete--and also in part justificatory--to magnify the crime to the proportions of its punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitan|first=William|title=Abelard &amp; Heloise|year=2007|publisher=Hacket}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Heloise's motive in responding to his letter was to set the record straight, that she had been if anything the instigator of their courtship.

== Burial ==
Héloïse's place of burial is uncertain. Abelard's bones were moved to the Oratory of the Paraclete after his death, and after Héloïse's death in 1163/64 her bones were placed alongside his. The bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards, but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the [[French Revolution]], and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in eastern Paris. The transfer of their remains there in 1817 is considered to have considerably contributed to the popularity of that cemetery, at the time still far outside the built-up area of Paris. By tradition, lovers or lovelorn singles leave letters at the crypt, in tribute to the couple or in hope of finding true love.

This remains, however, disputed. The [[Oratory of the Paraclete]] claims Abélard and Héloïse are buried there and that what exists in Père Lachaise is merely a monument&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Clannish |first=M. T.|title=Abelard: A Medieval Life|year=1999|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell| isbn =0-631-21444-5|pages=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; or cenotaph. Others believe that while Abelard is buried in the tomb at Père Lachaise, Heloïse's remains are elsewhere.

'''''Intellectuals and Society''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Thomas Sowell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The National Review]]|authorlink=Thomas Sowell|first=Thomas|last=Sowell|date=July 17, 2012|title=Why Aren’t Race Riots News?|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/309578/why-aren-t-race-riots-news-thomas-sowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=812 The Independent Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was initially published on January 5, 2010 by [[Basic Books]].

[[Intellectual]]s are defined as "idea workers" that exercise profound influence on policy makers and public opinion, but are often not directly accountable for the results. ''Intellectuals and Society'' examines the record of these idea workers and the conditions, methods and incentives driving their points of view that, according to Sowell, have often resulted in disaster for societies where intellectuals have been allowed "undue influence". 

==Undue influence of intellectuals==
Sowell explained undue influence of intellectuals as follows:

:"Those whose careers are built on the creation and dissemination of ideas — the intellectuals — have played a role in many societies out of all proportion to their numbers. Whether that role has, on balance, made those around them better off or worse off is one of the key questions of our times.

:The quick answer is that intellectuals have done both. But certainly, during the 20th century, it is hard to escape the conclusion that intellectuals have on balance made the world a worse and more dangerous place. Scarcely a mass-murdering dictator of the 20th century was without his supporters, admirers, or apologists among the leading intellectuals — not only within his own country, but in foreign democracies, where intellectuals were free to say whatever they wanted.

:...intellectuals are people whose end products are intangible ideas, and they are usually judged by whether those ideas sound good to other intellectuals or resonate with the public. Whether their ideas turn out to work — whether they make life better or worse for others — is another question entirely."&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, T. "Intellectuals and Society" (January 5, 2010), National Review Online. Retrieved June 14, 2009 [http://article.nationalreview.com/419693/intellectuals-and-society/thomas-sowell The National Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Sowell argues that intellectuals, whom he defines as people whose occupations deal primarily with ideas (writers, historians, academics, etc.), usually consider themselves as "anointed", or as endowed with superior intellect or insight with which to guide the masses and those who have authority over them. Sowell contends that several characteristics mark such intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals... pp. 4–116; 281–319&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working with ideas===
An intellectual’s{{clarify|date=March 2016}} work begins and ends with ideas, not the practical application of ideas to real world problems. These purveyors of ideas may be at all points of the political and ideological spectrum, although Sowell generally reserves his sharpest criticisms for those on the left. Certain common patterns in intellectuals, he argues, cut across specific political ideologies. Intellectuals, for example, show a marked preference for third parties,{{clarify|date=March 2016}} working outside the established power structures and applying what is presumed to be superior insight, to control the resources and decision making processes of the masses and their official leaders. This preference sometimes makes outwardly competing ideologies appear more alike than different. For example both [[National Socialism]] and [[Stalinism]] attempted to [[micro-manage]] the lives of their citizens; both implemented sweeping [[propaganda]] campaigns to [[Reframing|reframe]] reality, and both resulted in leadership by an elite outside group. This, apparently, despite the fact that both movements were notoriously anti-intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… pp. 75–157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of real accountability===
The work of intellectuals is ultimately not subject to external (real world) verifiability, as compared to those engaged in more practical pursuits with readily observable results. An intellectual, for example, can condemn a military operation for "excessive force" but has no accountability in regards to the actual outcome of that operation. By contrast, a military commander who fails to deploy sufficient force at the appropriate time can pay with his own life and that of his men. The acclaim given to intellectuals, despite their predictions having failed, is a prime example of the lack of ultimate accountability, Sowell maintains.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… p. 4–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrow and specialized knowledge===
Intellectuals usually have thorough knowledge in their areas of expertise. Outside these fields, however, they may be as uninformed as the average person. Too often, Sowell argues, this does not stop them from attempting to influence public opinion in areas where they are not fully qualified. Sowell lists several examples that he argues support his thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… p. 13-50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual climate of distortion and misinformation===
Sowell states that intellectuals often assume that their specialized knowledge qualifies them to guide others, as do experts in any field of endeavor, practical or otherwise. Sowell argues that what is crucial is their influence on the people who wield decision making power. The presumption of insight often creates a climate that influences the way events are reported by the media, and may make politicians hesitant to take certain approaches to problem-solving. Before World War II, for example, British intellectuals played a large role in the process of creating the opposition to re-armament, which proved to be a deadly mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… pp. 203–281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal virtuosity (rhetoric) versus evidence or logic===
Sowell suggests that intellectuals rely heavily on what he calls "verbal virtuosity" (clever phrasing, vague [[euphemism]]s, witty quotes, deceptive labeling, name-calling and sneering asides) to substitute for evidence, logic and analysis. Other tactics of "verbal virtuosity" include dismissing opposing ideas as simplistic, portraying those making opposing arguments as morally unworthy, invoking "rights" which have no legal basis, vague calls for "change", reliance on the abstract versus the concrete, and a constant "filtering of reality".&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… pp. 10–241&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ego-involvement and personalization===
The presumption of wisdom and/or virtue causes intellectuals{{clarify|date=March 2016}} to personalize situations where contending ideas are involved. This often results in: (a) the demonization of opponents, and (b) personal fulfillment serving as a substitute for debate and evidence. Sowell does not make it clear if intellectuals acquired these traits from politicians, or the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… pp. 75–157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kumazawa Banzan portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Kumazawa Banzan]]

{{nihongo|'''Kumazawa Banzan'''|熊沢 蕃山||1619 &amp;ndash; September 9, 1691}} was an adherent of a branch of [[Neo-Confucianism]] called [[Wang Yangming]] Studies (Japanese: ''Yōmeigaku'': 陽明学), who lived during the early [[Edo period]]. His childhood name (yōmei) was  {{nihongo|Sashichirō|左七郞}}, his [[imina]] was {{nihongo|Hakukei|伯継}}, also read Shigetsugu. His common name ([[azana]]) was {{nihongo|Ryōkai|either 了介 or 良介}}, and he was commonly known by the personal names ([[tsūshō]]) as {{nihongo|Jirōhachi|次郎八}} or {{nihongo|Suke'emon|助右衛門}}. His most common courtesy name ([[Art name|gō]]) was {{nihongo|Sokuyūken|息游軒}}. His surname "Kumazawa" (熊沢) was changed to that of "Shigeyama" (蕃山) in 1660 and the latter, read in Sino-Japanese as "Banzan", became his posthumous courtesy title, by which even now he is commonly known.

== Yōmeigaku ==
Yōmeigaku is the Japanese term for a school of Neo-Confucianism associated with its founder, the Chinese philosopher [[Wang Yangming]], characterised by introspection and activism, and which exercised a profound influence on Japanese revisions of Confucian political and moral theory in Japan during the [[Edo period]].

== Life ==

===Early life===
He was born in Kyoto Inari (now [[Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto]]), the eldest son of six children. His father, a [[rōnin]], was called {{nihongo|Nojiri Tōbei Kazutoshi|野尻藤兵衛一利}} and his mother was called {{nihongo|Kamejo|亀女}}. At the age of eight, he was adopted by his maternal grandfather, {{nihongo|Kumazawa Morihisa|熊沢守久}}, a [[samurai]] serving under [[Tokugawa Yorifusa]], the ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Mito Domain|Mito]], and took from him the surname of Kumazawa.

===Leaving to study under Nakae Tōju===
In 1634, through the introduction of {{nihongo|[[Itakura Shigemasa]]|板倉重昌}}, a [[fudai]] vassal of the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawa]],&lt;ref&gt;McMullen, James. (1999). "Idealism, Protest and the Tale of Genji," pp.71-72. [Note: A slightly different explanation is proffered in Japanese Wikipedia article on Kumazawa.]&lt;/ref&gt; he went to serve as a page under  {{nihongo|[[Ikeda Mitsumasa]]|池田光政}}, the daimyo of the [[Okayama Domain]] in [[Bizen Province]].  He left the Ikeda household for a time, returning to his grandfather's home in Kirihara, [[Ōmi Province]] (now [[Ōmihachiman, Shiga|Ōmihachiman]]).

===Time in the Okayama Domain===
In 1645, again with the recommendation of the Kyōgoku family, he went to work in the Okayama Domain. As Mitsumasa's thinking leaned towards Yōmeigaku, he made much use of Banzan, valuing him for having studied under Tōju. Banzan worked mainly in the [[Han school]] called {{nihongo|Hanabatake Kyōjō|花畠教場}}, whose name means "Flowerfield Teaching Place".  This school opened in 1641, making it one of the first in Japan. In 1647 Banzan became an aide, with an {{nihongo|entitlement|知行}} of 300 [[koku]]. In 1649 he went with Mitsumasa to Edo.

In 1650, he was promoted to be the head of a {{nihongo|group of artillery men|鉄砲組}}. In 1651, he drafted the regulations for a {{nihongo|Hanazonokai?|花園会}}, literally "flower garden club", a place for the education of common people. This was the initial incarnation of the first school in Japan for educating commoners, {{nihongo|[[Shizutani Gakkō]]|閑谷学校}} which opened in 1670, after Banzan's had left the service of his domain. In 1654, when the Bizen plains were assailed by floods and large-scale famine, he put all his energies into assisting Mitsumasa with relief efforts. Together with {{nihongo|[[Tsuda Nagatada]]|津田永忠}}, he worked as an aide to Mitsumasa, helping to establish the start of a domain government in Okayama Domain. He worked to produce fully developed strategies on agriculture, including ways of providing relief to small-scale farmers and land engineering projects to manage mountains and rivers. However, his daring reforms of domain government brought him into opposition with the traditionalist {{nihongo|elders|家老|[[Karo (samurai)|karō]]}}. In addition, while Banzan was a follower of Yōmeigaku, the official philosophy of the Edo [[shogunate]] was a different form of Neo-Confucianism, {{nihongo|[[Shushigaku]]|朱子学}}.  Banzan was criticised by figures such as {{nihongo|[[Hoshina Masayuki]]|保科正之}} and {{nihongo|[[Hayashi Razan]]|林羅山}}.  In fact, Banzan was the first in a series of notable neo-Confucianists who would find themselves confronting the evolving critical powers of the [[Hayashi clan (Confucian scholars)|Hayashi clan]] of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Randall. (1998). ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, Banzan was left with no choice but to leave the service of [[Okayama Castle]] and live in hiding in {{nihongo|Shigeyama-mura|蕃山村}}, [[Wake District, Okayama|Wake District]] (now Shigeyama, [[Bizen, Okayama]]). The name "Banzan" derives from the word "Shigeyama". The location where his home was is {{nihongo|[[Banzan-chō]]|蕃山町}}, [[Okayama-shi]].

===Time out of power and later life===
Eventually, in 1657, unable to withstand the pressure from the shogunate and the domain leaders, he left Okayama Domain.

In 1658, he moved to Kyoto and opened a private [[juku]] (school). In 1660, at the request of {{nihongo|[[Nakagawa Hisakiyo]]|中川久清}}, he travelled to [[Tateda, Oita]], and gave directions on land management. In 1661, his fame grew, and he again came to be under the surveillance of the shogunate, and was eventually driven out of Kyoto by {{nihongo|[[Makino Chikashige]]|牧野親成}}, aide to the head of the {{nihongo|Kyoto Shoshidai|京都所司代}}.

In 1667, he escaped to [[Yoshinoyama]], [[Yamato Province]] (now [[Yoshino, Nara]]). He then moved to live in hiding in {{nihongo|Kaseyama|鹿背山}}, [[Yamashiro Province]] (now [[Kizugawa, Kyoto]]). In 1669, on orders from the shogunate, he was put under the control of {{nihongo|[[Matsudaira Nobuyuki]]|松平信之}}, the head of the {{nihongo|[[Akashi Domain]]|明石藩}}, [[Harima Province]]. In 1683, as Nobuyuki was transferred to [[Kōriyama Province]], he moved to {{nihongo|Yatayama|矢田山}}, Yamato Province (now [[Yamatokōriyama]], Nara). In 1683, he received the invitation of the {{nihongo|[[tairō]]|大老}} {{nihongo|[[Hotta Masatoshi]]|堀田正俊}}, but refused it. After serving the Okayama District, in his days outside public service, he often wrote, and criticised the policies of the shogunate, particularly {{nihongo|[[sankin-kōtai]]|参勤交代}}, {{nihongo|[[Heinō Bunri]]|兵農分離}} (the policy forbidding those outside the samurai class to arm themselves), and the hereditary system. He was also critical of the government of Okayama Domain.

Banzan's goal was to reform the Japanese government by advocating the adoption of a political system based on merit rather than heredity and the employment of political principles to reinforce the merit system.

In 1687, he was put under the control of {{nihongo|[[Matsudaira Tadayuki]]|松平忠之}}, head of {{nihongo|[[Koga Domain]]|古河藩}}, {{nihongo|Shimousa Province|下総国}}, and heir to Matsudaira Nobuyuki, and ordered to remain inside &lt;!-- {{nihongo|(place in Koga Castle - don't know reading)|竜崎頼政廓 --&gt; [[Koga Castle]]. In 1691 the rebellious Confucian became ill and died within Koga Castle at the age of 74.

===After his death===
Banzan's remains were buried by Tadayuki with much ceremony at {{nihongo|Keienji|鮭延寺}}, in {{nihongo|Ōtsutsumi|大堤}}, [[Koga, Ibaraki]]. The initial inscription on the tombstone was {{nihongo|"grave of Sokuyūken"|息游軒墓}}, using his posthumous name, but this was later changed to {{nihongo|"grave of Kumazawa Sokuyūken Hatsukei"|熊沢息游軒伯継墓}}.

In the [[Bakumatsu]] period, Banzan's philosophy came back into the spotlight, greatly influencing the structure of government. It was favoured by, among others, {{nihongo|[[Fujita Tōko]]|藤田東湖}} and {{nihongo|[[Yoshida Shōin]]|吉田松陰}}, becoming a motivating force in the toppling of the shogunate government. [[Katsu Kaishū]] praised Banzan as "a hero in Confucian robes".

Outside the realm of politics, Banzan would in time become something of a cultural hero because, while attending to actions and words which demonstrated an enduring concern for commoners and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Najita, Tetsuo]]. (1980). ''Japan: The Intellectual Foundations of Modern Japanese Politics.'' p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was praised for resistance to the imposition of corrupt politics and bureaucratic burdens on ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;Najita, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the Edo government honoured Banzan with the title of {{nihongo|Upper Fourth Rank|正四位}}, in recognition of his contribution to the development of learning in the Edo period.

[[Pantheism]] is the belief that the [[universe]] (or [[nature]] as the totality of everything) is identical with [[divinity]], or that everything composes an all-encompassing, [[immanence|immanent]] God. Pantheists thus do not believe in a distinct [[personal god|personal]] or [[anthropomorphic]] god. Some Eastern religions are considered to be pantheistic.

==Pantheists==
&lt;!--Please add brief descriptions, birth/death year and citations to all the entries in this list, since "pantheism" is broad enough to require elaboration to be a meaningful term.--&gt;

Anilionytė is the author of a highly controversial novel about the relationship between [[high culture]] and [[popular culture]] ''O kas po to?'' (''And what then?''). The novel is characterized by a mix of eroticism, philosophical ponderings on the human condition  and psychological insight, social criticism and cold descriptions of moral failures. The prototype of this novel is a famous Lithuanian pop singer, [[Edmundas Kučinskas]]. Anilionytė is outstanding among other Lithuanian writers for her ironic, provocative writing style. She has been awarded some important literature prizes. She received the 2006 ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine "Discovery of the Year" award for the novel.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

She has translated many works by well-known German philosophers into Lithuanian. She was awarded the [[Franz Dovydaitis Prize]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

'''Lucian Blaga''' ({{IPA-ro|lut͡ʃiˈan ˈblaɡa|lang|Ro-Lucian Blaga.ogg}}; 9 May 1895 – 6 May 1961) was a [[Romania]]n philosopher, poet, playwright and novelist.

==Biography==

Lucian Blaga was a commanding personality of the Romanian culture of the [[interbellum]] period. He was a philosopher and writer highly acclaimed for his originality, a university professor and a diplomat. He was born on 9 May 1895 in [[Lancrăm]], near [[Alba Iulia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], his father being an Orthodox priest. He later described his early childhood, in the autobiographical ''The Chronicle and the Song of Ages'', as "under the sign of the incredible absence of the word".

His elementary education was in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] at [[Sebeș]] (1902–1906), after which he attended the "[[Andrei Șaguna]]" Highschool in [[Brașov]] (1906–1914), under the supervision of a relative, Iosif Blaga (Lucian's father had died when the former was 13), who was the author of the first Romanian treatise on the theory of drama. At the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], he began theological studies at [[Sibiu]], where he graduated in 1917. He published his first philosophy article on the Bergson theory of subjective time. From 1917 to 1920, he attended courses at the [[University of Vienna]], where he studied philosophy and obtained his [[PhD]].

Upon returning to [[Transylvania]], now a part of Romania, he contributed to the Romanian press, being the editor of the magazines ''Culture'' in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] and ''The Banat'' in [[Lugoj]].

In 1926, he became involved in Romanian diplomacy, occupying successive posts at Romania's legations in [[Warsaw]], [[Prague]], [[Lisbon]], [[Bern]] and [[Vienna]]. His political protector was the famous poet [[Octavian Goga]], who was briefly a prime minister; Blaga was a relative of his wife. He was elected a titular member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1936. His acceptance speech was entitled ''Elogiul satului românesc'' (''In Praise of the Romanian Village'').

In 1939, he became professor of cultural philosophy at the [[Babeş-Bolyai University|University of Cluj]], temporarily located in Sibiu in the years following the [[Second Vienna Award]]. During his stay in Sibiu, he edited, beginning in 1943, the annual magazine ''Saeculum''.

He was dismissed from his university professor chair in 1948 because he refused to express his support to the new Communist regime and he worked as librarian for the [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] branch of the History Institute of the Romanian Academy. He was forbidden to publish new books, and until 1960 he was allowed to publish only translations. He completed the translation of ''[[Faust]]'', the masterpiece of [[Goethe]], one of the German writers that influenced him most.

In 1956, he was nominated to the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} on the proposal of Bazil Munteanu of [[France]] and [[Rosa del Conte]] of [[Italy]], but it seems the idea was [[Mircea Eliade]]'s. Still, the [[Communist Romania|Romanian Communist government]] sent two emissaries to [[Sweden]] to protest against the nomination,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} because Blaga was considered an idealist philosopher, and his poems were forbidden until 1962.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

He was diagnosed with cancer and died on 6 May 1961. He was buried on his birthday, 9 May, in the countryside village cemetery of [[Lancrăm]], Romania.

[[File:Lucian Blaga with daughter.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Blaga with daughter]]
He was married to Cornelia (née Brediceanu).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100710154435/https://romanialibera.ro/opinii/aldine/cornelia-blaga-brediceanu-diplomat-la-parisa-175333.html Cornelia Blaga-Brediceanu, diplomat la Parisa]. romanialibera.ro (22 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; They had a daughter, Dorli, her name being derived from {{wikt-lang|ro|dor}}, a noun that can be translated, roughly, as "longing".

The [[University of Sibiu]] bears his name today.

==Philosophy==

His philosophical work is grouped in four trilogies:
* ''Filosofia cunoașterii'' ([[gnoseology]]) (1943)
* ''Filosofia culturii'' (culture) (1944)
* ''Filosofia valorilor'' (values) (1946)
* ''Filosofia cosmologica'' (cosmology) (1983 posthumously)

The fourth work, ''Cosmologica'', was completed but not published at the time because of communist regime censorship. Before death, Blaga left an editorial testament on how his works are to be published posthumously &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blaga |first=Lucian |year=2013 |title=Trilogia cunoasterii |url=http://www.humanitas.ro/humanitas/trilogia-cunoa%C5%9Fterii |location=Bucharest |publisher=Editura Humanitas |isbn=978-973-50-3575-4 | pages=7–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''Charon's Ferry'' is intended to be a companion to the philosophical trilogies. In it Blaga addresses some of the more problematic philosophical issues such as those pertaining to political, (para)psychological or occult phenomena, under the name of a fictive philosopher (Leonte Pătrașcu).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blaga |first=Lucian |year=2013 |title=Trilogia cunoasterii |url=http://www.humanitas.ro/humanitas/trilogia-cunoa%C5%9Fterii |location=Bucharest |publisher=Editura Humanitas |isbn=978-973-50-3575-4 | page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madhyamaka''' ("Middle way" or "Centrism"; {{lang-sa|Madhyamaka}}, {{zh|t=中觀见|p=Zhōngguān Jìan}}, [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]]: ''dbu ma pa'') also known as ''Śūnyavāda'' (the [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] doctrine) and ''Niḥsvabhāvavāda'' (the no [[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']] doctrine) refers to a tradition of [[Buddhist philosophy]] and practice founded by the Indian philosopher [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] (c. 150-250 CE).&lt;ref name="Buddhist Thought2"&gt;[[Paul Williams (British professor)|Williams, Paul]] (2000). ''Buddhist Thought'' Routledge, p140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wynne, Alexander, Early Buddhist Teaching as Proto-sunyavada.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundational text of the Mādhyamaka tradition is [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]]'s ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' (Root Verses on the Middle Way). More broadly, Madhyamaka also refers to the ultimate nature of phenomena and the realization of this in [[Buddhist meditation|meditative equipoise]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhyamaka thought had a major influence on the subsequent development of the [[Mahayana]] Buddhist tradition. It is the dominant interpretation of Buddhist philosophy in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and has also been influential in [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asian Buddhist]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;Hugon, Pascale, "Tibetan Epistemology and Philosophy of Language", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/epistemology-language-tibetan/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the classical Madhyamaka thinkers''',''' all [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|phenomena]] (''dharmas'') are [[Śūnyatā|empty]] (''śūnya'') of "nature,"{{sfn|Brunholzl|2004|p=70}} a "substance" or "essence" ([[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']]) which gives them "solid and independent existence," because they are [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently co-arisen]].{{sfn|Brunholzl|2004|p=590}} But this "emptiness" itself is also "empty": it does not have an existence on its own, nor does it refer to a transcendental reality beyond or above phenomenal reality.{{sfn|Cheng|1981}}{{sfn|Garfield|1994}}{{sfn|Garfield|2012}}

==Etymology==

''Madhya'' is a Sanskrit word meaning "middle". It is cognate with Latin ''med-iu-s'' and English ''mid''. The ''-ma'' suffix is a superlative, giving ''madhyama'' the meaning of "mid-most" or "medium". The ''-ka'' suffix is used to form adjectives, thus ''madhyamaka'' means "middleling". The ''-ika'' suffix is used to form possessives, with a collective sense, thus ''mādhyamika'' mean "belonging to the mid-most" (the ''-ika'' suffix regularly causes a lengthening of the first vowel and elision of the final ''-a'').

In a Buddhist context these terms refer to the "middle path" (''madhyama pratipada'')  between the extremes of annihilationism (''ucchedavāda'') and eternalism (''śassatavāda''), for example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''ity etāv ubhāv antāv anupagamya madhyamayā pratipadā tathāgato dharmaṃ deśayati |'' - Kātyāyana Sūtra.  &lt;br /&gt;
Thus, the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma by a middle path avoiding both these extremes. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

* ''Madhyamaka'' refers to the school of thought associated with Nāgārjuna and his commentators.
* ''Mādhyamika'' refers to adherents of the Madhyamaka school.

Note that in both words the stress is on the first syllable.

==Philosophical overview==
{{Buddhist Philosophy sidebar}}

=== Svabhāva, what Madhyamaka denies ===
{{main|Svabhava}}
Central to Madhyamaka philosophy is ''[[śūnyatā]]'', "emptiness", and this refers to the central idea that [[Dhamma theory|dharmas]] are empty of [[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 12, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This term has been translated variously as essence, intrinsic nature, inherent existence, own being and substance.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Westerhoff, Jan Christoph, "Nāgārjuna", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2018 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/nagarjuna/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, according to Richard P. Hayes, svabhava can be interpreted as either "identity" or as "causal independence".{{sfn|Hayes|2003|p=4}} Likewise, Westerhoff notes that [[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']] is a complex concept that has ontological and cognitive aspects. The ontological aspects include [[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']] as [[essence]], as a property which makes an object what it is, as well as [[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']] as [[Substance theory|substance]], meaning, as the Madhyamaka thinker [[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]] defines it, something that does "not depend on anything else".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is substance-[[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']], the objective and independent existence of any object or concept, which Madhyamaka arguments mostly focus on refuting.&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; A common structure which Madhyamaka uses to negate [[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']] is the [[Catuṣkoṭi|''catuṣkoṭi'']] ("four corners" or tetralemma), which roughly consists of four alternatives: some proposition is true, it is false, it is both, or it is neither true or false. Some of the major topics discussed by classical Madhyamaka include [[causality]], change, and [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhyamaka's denial of [[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']] does not mean a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] denial of all things, for in a conventional everyday sense, Madhyamaka does accept that one can speak of "things", and yet ''ultimately'' these things are empty of inherent existence.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=361}} Furthermore, "emptiness" itself is also "empty": it does not have an existence on its own, nor does it refer to a transcendental reality beyond or above phenomenal reality.{{sfn|Cheng|1981}}{{sfn|Garfield|1994}}{{sfn|Garfield|2012}}

[[Svabhava|''Svabhāva'']]'s cognitive aspect is merely a superimposition (''samāropa'') that beings make when they perceive and conceive of things. In this sense then, emptiness does not exist as some kind of primordial reality, but it is simply a corrective to a mistaken conception of how things exist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This idea of [[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']] that Madhyamaka denies is then not just a conceptual philosophical theory, but it is a [[cognitive distortion]] that beings automatically impose on the world, such as when we regard the [[Skandha|five aggregates]] as constituting a single [[Ātman (Hinduism)|self]]. [[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]] compares it to someone who suffers from [[vitreous floaters]] that cause the illusion of hairs appearing in their visual field.&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This cognitive dimension of [[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']] means that just understanding and assenting to Madhyamaka reasoning is not enough to end the suffering caused by our [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] of the world, just like understanding how an [[optical illusion]] works does not make it stop functioning. What is required is a kind of [[cognitive shift]] (termed ''realization'') in the way the world appears and therefore some kind of practice to lead to this shift.&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; As Candrakirti says:&lt;blockquote&gt;For one on the road of [[Samsara|cyclic existence]] who pursues an inverted view due to [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]], a mistaken object such as the superimposition (''samāropa'') on the [[Skandha|aggregates]] appears as real, but it does not appear to one who is close to the view of the real nature of things.&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Much of Madhyamaka philosophy centers on showing how various [[Essentialism|essentialist]] ideas have absurd conclusions through [[Reductio ad absurdum|''reductio ad absurdum'']] arguments (known as ''prasanga'' in Sanskrit). Chapter 15 of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]]'s ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' centers on the words [[svabhava]] {{refn|group=note|'Own-beings',{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=360}} unique nature or substance,{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=162}} an identifying characteristic; an identity; an essence,{{sfn|Hayes|1994|p=317}}}} parabhava{{refn|group=note|A differentiating characteristic,{{sfn|Hayes|1994|p=317}} the fact of being dependent,{{sfn|Hayes|1994|p=317}}}} [[bhava]] {{refn|group=note|'Being',{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=361}} 'self-nature or substance'{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=165}}}} and [[abhava]].{{refn|group=note|Not being present; absence:{{sfn|Hayes|1994|p=316}}}} According to Peter Harvey:

{{quote|Nagarjuna's critique of the notion of own-nature{{refn|group=note|svabhava}} (''Mk.'' ch. 15) argues that anything which arises according to conditions, as all phenomena do, can have no inherent nature, for what is depends on what conditions it. Moreover, if there is nothing with own-nature, there can be nothing with 'other-nature' (''para-bhava''), i.e. something which is dependent for its existence and nature on something ''else'' which has own-nature. Furthermore, if there is neither own-nature nor other-nature, there cannot be anything with a true, substantial existent nature (''bhava''). If there is no true existent, then there can be no non-existent (''abhava'').{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=97}}}}

An important element of Madhyamaka refutation is that the classical Buddhist doctrine of [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent arising]] (the idea that every phenomena is dependent on other phenomena) cannot be reconciled with "a conception of self-nature or substance" and that therefore essence theories are contrary not only to the Buddhist scriptures but to the very ideas of [[causality]] and change.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=165, 162}} Any enduring [[Svabhāva|essential nature]] would prevent any causal interaction, or any kind of origination. For things would simply always have been, and will always continue to be, without any change.&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 40-41, 322-333.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Nāgārjuna equates svabhāva (essence) with bhāva (existence) in Chapter 15 of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā}}  As [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] writes in the MMK:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We state that conditioned origination is emptiness. It is mere designation depending on something, and it is the middle path. (24.18)

Since nothing has arisen without depending on something, there is nothing that is not empty. (24.19) &lt;ref&gt;Bronkhorst (2009), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The two truths ===
{{main|Two truths doctrine}}Beginning with [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]], Madhyamaka discerns [[Two truths doctrine|two levels of truth]], conventional truth (everyday [[Common sense|commonsense]] reality) and ultimate truth ([[Śūnyatā|emptiness]]).{{sfn|Cheng|1981}}&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Rje Tsong Khapa; Garfield, Jay; Geshe Ngawang Samten (translators), Ocean of Reasoning: A Great Commentary on Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Madhyamaka argues that all phenomena are empty of ''svabhava'' and only exist in dependence on other causes, conditions and concepts. Conventionally, Madhyamaka holds that beings do perceive concrete objects which they are aware of empirically.{{sfn|Brunholzl|2004|p=73}} In Madhyamaka this phenomenal world is the limited truth - ''[[Samvriti|samvrti]] satya,'' which literally means “to completely cover, conceal, or obscure” and arises due to [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2004, p. 80, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; This seeming reality does not ''really'' exist as the highest truth realized by [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|wisdom]] which is ''[[Paramārtha-satya|paramartha]] satya'' (''parama'' is literally “supreme or ultimate,” and ''[[artha]]'' means “object, purpose, or actuality”)'','' and yet it has a kind of conventional reality which has its uses for reaching liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2004, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This limited truth includes everything, including the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself, the teachings ([[Dharma]]), liberation and even Nāgārjuna's own arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Bronkhorst (2009), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Two truths doctrine|two truth schema]] which did not deny the importance of convention allowed Nāgārjuna to defend himself against charges of [[nihilism]], understanding both correctly meant seeing the [[Middle Way|middle way]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Without relying upon convention, the ultimate fruit is not taught. Without understanding the ultimate, nirvana is not attained."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Kahn further explains: "The emptiness of emptiness refutes ultimate truth as yet another argument for essentialism under the guise of being beyond the conventional or as the foundation of it. To realize emptiness is not to find a transcendent place or truth to land in but to see the conventional as merely conventional. Here lies the key to liberation. For to see the deception is to be free of deception, like a magician who knows the magic trick. When one is no longer fooled by false appearances, phenomena are neither reified nor denied. They are understood interdependently, as ultimately empty and thus, as only conventionally real.  This is the Middle Way."&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref group="web" name="Susan Kahn"&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;[http://emptinessteachings.com/2014/09/11/the-two-truths-of-buddhism-and-the-emptiness-of-emptiness/ Susan Kahn, ''The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness.'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The limited, perceived reality is an experiential reality or a [[Nominalism|nominal]] reality which beings impute on the ultimate reality, it is not an ontological reality with substantial or independent existence.{{sfn|Brunholzl|2004|p=73}}&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hence, the two truths aren't two metaphysical realities, but according to Karl Brunnholzl, "the two realities refer to just what is experienced by two different types of beings with different types and scopes of perception."&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Brunnholzl, 2004, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]] says:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is through the perfect and the false seeing of all entities That the entities that are thus found bear two natures. The object of perfect seeing is true reality, And false seeing is seeming reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This means that the distinction between the two truths is primarily [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and depending on the cognition of the observer, not [[Ontology|ontological]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; As [[Shantideva]] says there are "two kinds of world", "the one of yogins and the one of common people."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2004, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The seeming reality is the world of [[Saṃsāra|samsara]] because conceiving of concrete and unchanging objects leads to clinging and suffering. As [[Buddhapalita]] states: "unskilled persons whose eye of intelligence is obscured by the darkness of delusion conceive of an essence of things and then generate attachment and hostility with regard to them." &lt;ref&gt;Tsongkhapa, Garfield, The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (Volume 3), 2002, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hayes, the two truths may also refer to two different goals in life: the highest goal of nirvana, and the lower goal of "commercial good". The highest goal is the liberation from attachment, both material ''and'' intellectual.{{sfn|Hayes|2003|p=8-9}}

=== The nature of ultimate reality ===
{{main|Śūnyatā}}According to Paul Williams, Nāgārjuna associates emptiness with the [[Two truths doctrine|ultimate truth]] but his conception of emptiness is not some kind of [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], but rather it is the very absence of true existence with regards to the conventional reality of things and events in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul, Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2002, p 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ultimate is itself empty, it is also explained as a "transcendence of deception" and hence is a kind of [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] truth which experiences the lack of substance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Because the nature of ultimate reality is said to be empty, even of "emptiness" itself, along with the very framework of the two truths are also conventional realities, and not part of the ultimate. This is often called "the emptiness of emptiness" and refers to the fact that even though Madhyamikas speak of emptiness as the ultimate unconditioned nature of things, this emptiness is itself empty of any real existence.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two truths themselves are therefore just a practical tool used to teach others, but do not exist within the actual meditative equipoise that realizes the ultimate.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; As Candrakirti says: "the noble ones who have accomplished what is to be accomplished do not see anything that is delusive or not delusive."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; From within the experience of the enlightened ones there is only one reality which appears non-conceptually, as Nāgārjuna says in the Sixty stanzas on reasoning: "that nirvana is the sole reality, is what the Victors have declared."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhāviveka|Bhāvaviveka's]] ''Madhyamakahrdayakārikā'' describes the ultimate truth through a negation of all four possibilities of the [[Catuṣkoṭi|''catuskoti'']]:&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Its character is neither existent, nor nonexistent, Nor both existent and nonexistent, nor neither. Centrists should know true reality That is free from these four possibilities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Atiśa|Atisha]] describes the ultimate as "here, there is no seeing and no seer, No beginning and no end, just peace...It is nonconceptual and nonreferential...it is inexpressible, unobservable, unchanging, and unconditioned."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 83-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the non-conceptual nature of the ultimate, according to Brunnholzl, the two truths are ultimately inexpressible as “one” or “different.”&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The middle way ===
{{main|Middle Way}}As noted by Roger Jackson, non-Buddhist and Buddhist writers ancient and modern, have argued that the Madhyamaka philosophy is [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] and this view has been challenged by others who argue that it is a [[Middle Way|middle way]] (''madhyamāpratipad'') between nihilism and eternalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyJjCx_tEiMC&amp;pg=PA4|title=The Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy|author=Junjirō Takakusu|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1998|isbn=978-81-208-1592-6|pages=4, 105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9gm9CzNd5EC|title=Ways of Thinking of Eastern Peoples: India, China, Tibet, Japan|author=Hajime Nakamura|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1991|isbn=978-81-208-0764-8|pages=590–591 footnote 20}}, Quote: "Already in India, 'sunyata' was liable to be misunderstood as nothingness or nihil'. (...) The [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]] of Hinayana Buddhism viewed the Madhyamika school as 'one that argues that everything is nothing. (...) It is only natural that most of the Western scholars call the ''prajnaparamita sutra'' or the doctrine of the Madhyamika school nihilism since criticisms were already expressed in India. Against such criticisms, however, Nagarjuna, founder of the Madhyamika school says, 'you are ignorant of the function of sunyata, the meaning of the sunyata and sunyata itself'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjkRAQAAIAAJ|title=Mādhyamika Śūnyatā, a Reappraisal: A Reappraisal of Mādhyamika Philosophical Enterprise with Special Reference to Nāgārjuna and Chandrakīrti|author=G. C.

So if the purpose of emptiness is the complete peace of all discursiveness and you just increase the web of discursiveness by thinking that the meaning of emptiness is nonexistence, you do not realize the purpose of emptiness [at all].&lt;ref name="Walser, Joseph 2005, p. 239"&gt;Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some scholars (Murti) interpret emptiness as described by Nāgārjuna as a Buddhist transcendental [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], while other scholars such as [[David Kalupahana]] consider this a mistake since this would not make it a middle way.&lt;ref name="ferrer1022"&gt;Jorge Noguera Ferrer, ''Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality.'' SUNY Press, 2002, page 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David J. Kalupahana]], ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way.'' SUNY Press, 1986, pages 48-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhyamaka thinkers also argue that since things have the nature of lacking true existence or own being (''niḥsvabhāva''), all things are mere conceptual constructs (''prajñaptimatra'') because they are just impermanent collections of causes and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul, Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2002, p 141.&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to the principle of causality itself, since ''everything'' is dependently originated.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge 2000, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in Madhyamaka, phenomena appear to arise and cease, but in an ultimate sense they do not arise or remain as inherently existent phenomena.&lt;ref name="Tsondru, Mabja 2011, pages 56-58"&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 56-58, 405-417.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul, Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2002, p 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Chapter 21 of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā goes into the reasoning behind this.&lt;ref name="Tsondru, Mabja 2011, pages 56-58"/&gt;|group=note}} This is believed by Madhyamaka philosophers to show that both views of [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] or eternalist existence (such as the Hindu ideas of [[Brahman]] or ''sat-dravya'') and [[nihilism]] are untenable&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 56-58, 405-417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;unclear&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=361}} These two views are considered to be the ''two extremes'' that Madhyamaka steers clear from:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;''Essentialism''{{sfn|Garfield|1995|p=88 footnote}} or ''eternalism'' (sastavadava){{sfn|Warder|2000|p=361}} - a belief that things inherently or substantially exist and are therefore efficacious objects of [[Tṛṣṇā|craving]] and [[Upādāna|clinging]];{{sfn|Garfield|1995|p=88 footnote}} Nagarjuna argues that we naively and innately perceive things as substantial, and it is this predisposition which is the root delusion that lies at the basis of all suffering.{{sfn|Garfield|1995|p=88 footnote}}&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;''Nihilism''{{sfn|Garfield|1995|p=88 footnote}} or ''annihilationism'' (ucchedavada){{sfn|Warder|2000|p=361}} - views that lead one to believe that there is no need to be responsible for one's actions, such as the idea one is annihilated at death or that nothing has causal effects, but also the idea that absolutely nothing exists.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

=== The usefulness of reason ===
In Madhyamaka, [[reason]] and [[debate]] is understood as a means to an end (liberation), and therefore it must be founded on the wish to help oneself and others end suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; Reason and logical arguments (such as those employed by classical [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]], i.e. [[Pramana|''pramana'']]) however, are also seen as being empty of any true validity or reality. They only serve as conventional remedies for our delusions.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Nāgārjuna famously attacked the notion that one could establish a valid cognition or epistemic proof ([[Pramana|''pramana'']]) in his ''Vigrahavyāvartanī'': &lt;blockquote&gt;If your objects are well established through valid cognitions, tell us how you establish these valid cognitions. If you think they are established through other valid cognitions, there is an [[infinite regress]]. Then, the first one is not established, nor are the middle ones, nor the last. If these [valid cognitions] are established even without valid cognition, what you say is ruined. In that case, there is an inconsistency, And you ought to provide an argument for this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]] comments on this statement by stating that Madhyamaka does not completely deny the use of pramanas conventionally, and yet ultimately they do not have a foundation:&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore we assert that mundane objects are known through the four kinds of authoritative cognition. They are mutually dependent: When there is authoritative cognition, there are objects of knowledge; when there are objects of knowledge, there is authoritative cognition. But neither authoritative cognition nor objects of knowledge exist inherently.&lt;ref name="Garﬁeld, Jay L 2008"&gt;Garﬁeld, Jay L. Turning a Madhyamaka Trick: Reply to Huntington, J Indian Philos (2008) 36:507–527 DOI 10.1007/s10781-008-9045-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;To the charge that if Nāgārjuna's arguments and words are also empty they therefore lack the power to refute anything, Nāgārjuna responds that:&lt;blockquote&gt;My words are without nature. Therefore, my thesis is not ruined. Since there is no inconsistency, I do not have to state an argument for a distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Further Nāgārjuna states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as one magical creation may be annihilated by another magical creation, and one illusory person by another person produced by an illusionist, This negation is the same.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Shantideva]] makes the same point when he states "thus, when one’s son dies in a dream, the conception “he does not exist” removes the thought that he does exist, but it is also delusive."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 203-204.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Madhyamaka does not deny that their arguments are not ''ultimately'' valid in some [[Foundationalism|foundational]] sense, just like all things. However, conventionally one is still able to use the opponent's own reasoning apparatus to refute their theories and help them see their errors. This remedial deconstruction does not replace their theories with another one, but simply dissolves all views, including the very fictional system of epistemic warrants (''pramanas'') used to establish them.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 202-203.&lt;/ref&gt; The point of Madhyamaka reasoning is not to establish any abstract validity or universal truth, it is simply a pragmatic project aimed at ending delusion and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nāgārjuna also argues that Madhyamaka only negates things conventionally, since ultimately, there is nothing there to negate, "I do not negate anything and there is also nothing to be negated."&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is only from the perspective of those who cling to the existence of things that it seems as if something is being negated. But Madhyamaka is not annihilating something, merely elucidating that this true existence never existed in the first place.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Thus, Madhyamaka uses language to make clear the limits of our concepts. Ultimately, reality cannot be depicted by concepts.{{sfn|Cheng|1981}}{{sfn|Garfield|1995|p=102}} According to [[Jay L. Garfield|Jay Garfield]], this creates a sort of tension in Madhyamaka literature, since it has use some concepts to convey its teachings.{{sfn|Garfield|1995|p=102}}

=== Soteriology ===

For Madhyamaka, the realization of emptiness is not just a satisfactory theory about the world, but a key understanding which allows one to reach liberation or [[nirvana]]. Nāgārjuna states in the MMK:&lt;blockquote&gt;With the cessation of ignorance, formations will not arise. Moreover, the cessation of ignorance occurs through right understanding. Through the cessation of this and that [link of dependent origination] this and that [other link] will not come about. The entire mass of suffering thereby completely ceases.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Pratītyasamutpāda|Dependent origination]] is the fundamental Buddhist analysis of the arising of suffering and therefore, according to Nāgārjuna, the cognitive shift which sees the nonexistence of [[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']] leads to the cessation of the first link in this chain of suffering, which then leads to the ending of the entire chain of causes and thus, of all suffering.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Nāgārjuna also states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Liberation (''moksa'') results from the cessation of actions (''karman'') and defilements (''klesa''). Actions and defilements result from representations (''vikalpa''). These from false imagining (''prapañca''). False imagining stops in emptiness (''sunyata''). (18.5)&lt;ref&gt;Bronkhorst (2009), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Therefore, the ultimate aim of understanding emptiness is not philosophical insight as such, but to gain a [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|liberated mind]] which does not cling to anything. To realize this, meditation on emptiness may proceed in stages, starting with the emptiness of both [[Fetter (Buddhism)#Identity view (sakkāya-diṭṭhi)|self]], objects and mental states,{{sfn|Brunholzl|2004|p=295-310}} culminating in a "natural state of nonreferential freedom."{{sfn|Brunholzl|2004|p=310}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Atthakavagga and Parayanavagga]], for early, Madhyamaka-like texts from the Buddhist canon on freedom from views.}} Moreover, the path to understand the ultimate truth is not one that negates or invalidates relative truths. Instead it is only through properly understanding and using the relative truth that the ultimate can be attained, as [[Bhāviveka|Bhāvaviveka]] says;&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to guide beginners a method is taught, comparable to the steps of a staircase that leads to perfect Buddhahood. Ultimate reality is only to be entered once we have understood seeming reality.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Does Madhyamaka have a position? ===
Nāgārjuna is famous for arguing that his philosophy was not a view, and that he in fact did not take any position (''paksa'') or thesis (''pratijña'') whatsoever since this would just be another form of clinging to some form of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul, Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2002, p 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garﬁeld, Jay L 2008"/&gt; In his ''Vigrahavyavartani'', Nāgārjuna states:&lt;blockquote&gt;If I had any position, I thereby would be at fault. Since I have no position, I am not at fault at all. If there were anything to be observed through direct perception and the other instances [of valid cognition], it would be something to be established or rejected. However, since no such thing exists, I cannot be criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Likewise in his ''Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning'', Nāgārjuna says: "By taking any standpoint whatsoever, you will be snatched by the cunning snakes of the afflictions. Those whose minds have no standpoint, will not be caught." &lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, The Center of the Sunlit Sky: Madhyamaka in the Kagyu Tradition, Shambhala, 2004, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Randall Collins states that for Nāgārjuna, ultimate reality is simply the idea that "no concepts are intelligible", while Ferrer notes that Nagarjuna criticized those whose mind held any "positions and beliefs", including the [[View (Buddhism)|view]] of emptiness, as Nāgārjuna says: "The Victorious Ones have announced that emptiness is the relinquishing of all [[View (Buddhism)|views]]. Those who are possessed of the view of emptiness are said to be incorrigible."&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Noguera Ferrer, ''Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality.'' SUNY Press, 2002, pages 102. The quote is from the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collins221"&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pages 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryadeva]] echoes this idea in his Four Hundred Verses:&lt;blockquote&gt;"First, one puts an end to what is not meritorious. In the middle, one puts an end to identity. Later, one puts an end to all views. Those who understand this are skilled."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, other texts mention a specific Madhyamaka thesis or view. [[Shantideva]] for example says "one cannot uphold any faultfinding in the thesis of emptiness" and [[Bhāviveka|Bhavaviveka's]] ''Blaze of Reasoning'' says: "as for our thesis, it is the emptiness of nature, because this is the nature of phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jay L. Garfield|Jay Garfield]] notes that Nagarjuna and Candrakirti both make positive arguments. He cites the MMK which states: "There does not exist anything that is not dependently arisen.Therefore there does not exist anything that is not empty" as well as Candrakirti's commentary on it which clearly states "We assert the statement 'emptiness itself is a designation.'"&lt;ref name="Garﬁeld, Jay L 2008" /&gt;

These positions however, are not a contradiction, since Madhyamaka can be said to have the "thesis of emptiness" only conventionally, in the context of debating or explaining it. According to Brunnholzl, even though Madhyamaka thinkers may express a thesis pedagogically, what they deny is that "they have any thesis that involves real existence or reference points or any thesis that is to be defended from their own point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Brunnholzl states that Madhyamaka analysis applies to all systems of thought, ideas and concepts, including Madhyamaka itself. This is because, the nature of Madhyamaka is "the deconstruction of any system and conceptualization whatsoever, including itself".&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Root verses on the Middle Way, Nagarjuna illustrates this point:&lt;blockquote&gt;By the flaw of having views about emptiness, those of little understanding are ruined, just as when incorrectly seizing a snake or mistakenly practicing an awareness-mantra.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2001, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origins and sources==
The Madhyamaka school is usually considered to have been founded by [[Nāgārjuna]], though it may have existed earlier.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=358}} Various scholars have noted that some of themes in the work of [[Nāgārjuna]] can also be found in earlier Buddhist sources.

=== Early Buddhist Texts ===
It is well known that the only sutra that [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] explicitly cites in his ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' (Chapter 15.7) is the "Advice to Kātyāyana", stating that "according to the Instructions to [[Katyayana (Buddhist)|Katyayana]], both existence and nonexistence are criticized by the Blessed One who opposed being and non-being."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to have been a Sanskrit version of the ''[[Kaccānagotta Sutta]]'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|Saṃyutta Nikāya]] ii.16-17).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The ''[[Kaccānagotta Sutta]]'' itself says:&lt;blockquote href="Alexander the Great"&gt;This world, Kaccana, for the most part depends on a duality–upon the notion of existence and the notion of nonexistence. But for one who sees the origin of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, there is no notion of nonexistence in regard to the world. And for one who sees the cessation of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, there is no notion of existence in regard to the world.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Joseph Walser also points out that verse six of chapter 15 contains an allusion to the “''Mahahatthipadopama sutta''”, another sutta of the ''Nidanavagga'', the collection which also contains the ''[[Kaccānagotta Sutta|Kaccānagotta]],'' and which contains various suttas that focus on the avoidance of extreme views, which are all held to be associated with either the extreme of eternality (''sasvata'') or the extreme of disruption (''uccheda'')''.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;'' Another allusion to an [[Early Buddhist Texts|early buddhist text]] noted by Walser is in [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]]'s Ratnavali chapter 1, where he makes reference to a statement in the ''Kevaddha sutta.''&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 186-187&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Atthakavagga and Parayanavagga|''Aṭṭhakavagga'' (Pali, "Octet Chapter") and the ''Pārāyanavagga'' (Pali, "Way to the Far Shore Chapter")]] are two small collections of suttas within the [[Pali Canon|Pāli Canon]] of [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]].{{refn|In the Pali canon, these chapters are the fourth and fifth chapters of the [[Khuddaka Nikaya]]'s [[Sutta Nipata]], respectively.|group=note}} They are among the earliest existing Buddhist literature, and place considerable emphasis on the rejection of, or non-attachment to, all [[View (Buddhism)|views]]. Gomez compared them to later Madhyamaka philosophy, which in its [[Prasangika|{{IAST|Prasaṅgika}}]] form especially makes a method of rejecting others' views rather than proposing its own.{{sfn|Gomez|1976}}

Tillman Vetter, although agreeing overall with Gomez's observations, suggests some refinements on historical and doctrinal grounds.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} First, he notes that neither of these short collections of suttas are homogeneous and hence are not all amenable to Gomez' proposals. According to Vetter, those suttas which do lend support to Gomez probably originated with a heterodox ascetic group that pre-dated the Buddha, and were integrated into the Buddhist Sangha at an early date, bringing with them some suttas that were already in existence and also composing further suttas in which they tried to combine their own teachings with those of the Buddha.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

Paul Fuller has rejected the arguments of Gomez and Vetter.{{sfn|Fuller|2005}} He finds that{{quote|... the Nikayas and the Atthakavagga present the same cognitive attitude toward [[View (Buddhism)|views]], wrong or right.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|p=151}}}}

Alexander Wynne also rejects both of Vetter's claims that the Parayanavagga shows a chronological stratification, and a different attitude toward mindfulness and liberating insight than do other works.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=75}}{{refn|Wynne devotes a chapter to the Parayanavagga.|group=note}}

=== Abhidharma and early Buddhist schools ===
The Madhyamaka school has been perhaps simplistically regarded as a reaction against the development of Buddhist [[Abhidharma]], however according to Joseph Walser, this is problematic.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; In Abhidharma, [[Dhamma theory|dharmas]] are characterized by defining traits (''lakṣaṇa'') or own-existence ([[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']]). The ''[[Abhidharmakośakārikā|Abhidharmakośabhāṣya]]'' states for example: “''dharma'' means ‘upholding,’ [namely], upholding intrinsic nature (''svabhāva'')”, while the ''[[Mahavibhasa|Mahāvibhāṣā]]'' states “intrinsic nature is able to uphold its own identity and not lose it”.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Ronkin, Noa, "Abhidharma", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2018 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/abhidharma/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However this does not mean that all Abhidharma systems hold that dharmas exist independently in an ontological sense, since all Buddhist schools hold that (most) dharmas are [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently originated]], this doctrine being a central core Buddhist view, rather in Abhidharma, [[Svabhava|''svabhāva'']] is typically something which arises dependent on other conditions and qualities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Svabhava|''Svabhāva'']] in the early Abhidharma systems then, is not a kind of ontological essentialism, but it is a way to categorize dharmas according to their distinctive characteristics. According to Noa Ronkin, the idea of ''svabhava'' evolved towards ontological dimension in the [[Sarvāstivādin]] [[Vaibhāṣika|Vaibhasika]] school's interpretation, which began to also use the term ''dravya'' which means "real existence".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This then, may have been the shift which Nagarjuna sought to attack when he targets certain Sarvastivada tenets.

However, the relationship between Madhyamaka and Abhidharma is complex, as Joseph Walser notes, "Nagarjuna’s position vis-à-vis abhidharma is neither a blanket denial nor a blanket acceptance. Nagarjuna’s arguments entertain certain abhidharmic standpoints while refuting others."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One example can be seen in Nagarjuna's Ratnavali which makes supports the study of a list of 57 moral faults which he takes from an Abhidharma text named the ''Ksudravastuka.''&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Abhidharmic analysis figures prominently in Madhyamaka treatises, and authoritative commentators like Candrakīrti emphasize that Abhidharmic categories function as a viable (and favored) system of conventional truths - they are more refined than ordinary categories, and they are not dependent on either the extreme of eternalism or on the extreme view of the discontinuity of karma, as the non-Buddhist categories of the time did.

Walser also notes that Nagarjuna's theories have much in common with the view of a sub-sect of the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamgikas]] called the [[Prajñaptivāda|Prajñaptivadins]], who held that suffering was ''prajñapti'' (designation by provisional naming) "based on conditioned entities that are themselves reciprocally designated" (''anyonya prajñapti'').&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; David Burton argues that for Nagarjuna, "dependently arisen entities have merely conceptually constructed existence (''prajñaptisat'')".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Commenting on this, Walser writes that "Nagarjuna is arguing for a thesis that the Prajñaptivádins already held, using a concept of prajñapti that they were already using."&lt;ref name="Walser, Joseph 2005, p. 239"/&gt;

===Prajñāpāramitā===
Madhyamaka thought is also closely related to a number of Mahāyāna sources; traditionally, the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]] sūtras are the literature most closely associated with Madhyamaka – understood, at least in part, as an exegetical complement to those Sūtras. Traditional accounts also depict Nāgārjuna as retrieving some of the larger Prajñāpāramitā sūtras from the world of the Nāgas (explaining in part the etymology of his name). Prajñā or ‘higher cognition’ is a recurrent term in Buddhist texts, explained as a synonym of Abhidharma, ‘insight’ (vipaśyanā) and ‘analysis of the dharmas’ (dharmapravicaya). Within a specifically Mahāyāna context, Prajñā figures as the most prominent in a list of Six Pāramitās (‘perfections’ or ‘perfect masteries’) that a Bodhisattva needs to cultivate in order to eventually achieve Buddhahood.  Madhyamaka offers conceptual tools to analyze all possible elements of existence, allowing the practitioner to elicit through reasoning and contemplation the type of view that the Sūtras express more authoritatively (being considered word of the Buddha) but less explicitly (not offering corroborative arguments). The vast Prajñāpāramitā literature emphasizes the development of higher cognition in the context of the [[Bodhisattva]] path; thematically, its focus on the emptiness of all dharmas is closely related to the Madhyamaka approach. Allusions to the prajñaparamita sutras can be found in Nagarjuna's work. One example is in the opening stanza of the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā|Root Verses on the Middle Way]], which seem to allude to the following statement found in two prajñaparamita texts:&lt;blockquote href="Bhavaviveka"&gt;And how does he wisely know conditioned co-production? He wisely knows it as neither production, nor stopping, neither cut oª nor eternal, neither single nor manifold, neither coming nor going away, as the appeasement of all futile discoursings, and as bliss.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The first stanza of Nagarjuna's root verses meanwhile, state:&lt;blockquote href="Buddhapalita"&gt;I pay homage to the Fully Enlightened One whose true, venerable words teach dependent-origination to be the blissful pacification of all mental proliferation, neither production, nor stopping, neither cut off nor eternal, neither single nor manifold, neither coming, nor going away.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pyrrhonism===
Because of the high degree of similarity between Madhyamaka and [[Pyrrhonism]],&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Kuzminski, ''Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas McEvilley]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McEvilley, ''The Shape of Ancient Thought'' 2002 pp499-505&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Neale&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMZwyPdY7eg&amp;t=52s&lt;/ref&gt; suspect that Nāgārjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India. [[Pyrrho]] of Elis (c. 360-c. 270 BCE), who is credited with founding this school of [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical philosophy]], was himself influenced by Buddhist philosophy during his stay in India with [[Alexander the Great]]'s army.

=== Nāgārjuna ===
As Jan Westerhoff notes, while [[Nāgārjuna]] is "one of the greatest thinkers in the history of Asian philosophy...contemporary scholars agree on hardly any details concerning him". This includes exactly when he lived (it can be narrowed down some time in the first three centuries CE), where he lived (Joseph Walser suggests [[Amaravati|Amarāvatī]] in east [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]) and exactly what constitutes his written corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous texts are attributed to him, but it is at least agreed by some scholars that what is called the Yukti (analytical) corpus is the core of his philosophical work. These texts are the "Root verses on the Middle way" (''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]],'' MMK), the "Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning" (''Yuktiṣāṣṭika''), the "Dispeller of Objections" (''Vigrahavyāvartanī''), the "Treatise on Pulverization" (''Vaidalyaprakaraṇa'') and the "Precious Garland" (''Ratnāvalī'').&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even the attribution of each one of these has been question by some modern scholars, except for the MMK which is by definition seen as his major work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Nāgārjuna]]'s main goal is often seen by scholars as refuting the [[essentialism]] of certain Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] schools (mainly [[Vaibhāṣika|''Vaibhasika'']]) which posited theories of [[Svabhava|''svabhava'']] (essential nature) and also the Hindu [[Nyaya|Nyāya]] and [[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]] schools which posited a theory of ontological substances (''dravyatas'').&lt;ref&gt;Wasler, Joseph. ''Nagarjuna in Context.'' New York: Columibia University Press. 2005, pgs. 225-263.&lt;/ref&gt; In the MMK he used ''[[Prasaṅgika|reductio ad absurdum]]'' arguments (''prasanga'') to show that any theory of substance or essence was unsustainable and therefore, phenomena (''dharmas'') such as change, causality, and sense perception were empty (''sunya'') of any essential existence. [[Nāgārjuna]] also famously equated the emptiness of [[Dhamma theory|''dharmas'']] with their [[dependent origination]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=120}}&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 66-71, 447-477.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul, Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2002, p 142.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] 24:18|group=note}}

Because of his philosophical work, Nāgārjuna is seen by some modern interpreters as restoring the [[Middle way]] of the Buddha, which had become challenged by absolutist metaphysical tendencies in certain philosophical quarters.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=120}}

=== Classical Madhyamaka Commentators ===
Nāgārjuna's pupil [[Āryadeva]] (3rd century CE) emphasized the [[Bodhisattva|Bodhisattva-ideal]]. His works are regarded as a supplement to Nāgārjuna's,{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=368}} on which he commented.{{sfn|Rizzi|1988|p=2}} Āryadeva wrote refutations of the theories of non-Buddhist Indian philosophical schools.{{sfn|Rizzi|1988|p=2}}

An influential commentator on Nāgārjuna was [[Buddhapālita]] (470–550) who has been interpreted as developing the '''[[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|prāsaṅgika]]''' approach to Nāgārjuna's works in his ''Madhyamakavṛtti'' (now only extant in Tibetan) which follows the orthodox Madhyamaka method by critiquing essentialism mainly through [[reductio ad absurdum]] arguments.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hayes, Richard, "Madhyamaka", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/madhyamaka/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Nāgārjuna, [[Buddhapālita]]'s main philosophical method is to show how all philosophical positions are ultimately untenable and self-contradictory, a style of argumentation called ''prasanga''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Buddhapālita]]'s method is often contrasted with that of [[Bhāviveka|Bhāvaviveka]] (c. 500 – c. 578), who argued in his ''Prajñāpadīpa'' (Lamp of Wisdom) for the use of logical arguments using the [[Pramana|''pramana'']] based epistemology of Indian logicians like [[Dignāga]]. In what would become a source of much future debate, [[Bhāviveka|Bhāvaviveka]] criticized [[Buddhapālita]] for not putting Madhyamaka arguments into proper "autonomous syllogisms" (''svatantra'').&lt;ref&gt;Newland, Guy, Introduction to Emptiness: As Taught in Tsong-Kha-Pa's Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path, 2009, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhāviveka|Bhāvaviveka]] argued that Mādhyamika's should always put forth syllogistic arguments to prove the truth of the Madhyamaka thesis. Instead of just criticizing other's arguments, a tactic called ''vitaṇḍā'' (attacking) which was seen in bad form in Indian philosophical circles, [[Bhāviveka|Bhāvaviveka]] held that Madhyamikas must positively prove their position using sources of knowledge ([[pramana]]s) agreeable to all parties.&lt;ref&gt;Newland, Guy, Introduction to Emptiness: As Taught in Tsong-Kha-Pa's Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path, 2009, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the position of a Madhyamaka was simply that phenomena are devoid of an inherent nature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This approach has been labeled the [[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|''svātantrika'']] style of Madhyamaka by Tibetan philosophers and commentators.

Another influential commentator, [[Chandrakirti|Candrakīrti]] (&lt;abbr href="Svātantrika"&gt;c.&lt;/abbr&gt; 600–650), sought to defend [[Buddhapālita]] and critique Bhāvaviveka's position (and [[Dignāga]]) that one ''must'' construct independent (''svatantra'') arguments to positively prove the Madhyamaka thesis, on the grounds this contains a subtle essentialist commitment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He argued that Madhyamikas do not ''have'' to argue by ''svantantra'', but can merely show the untenable consequences (''prasaṅga'') of all philosophical positions put forth by their adversary.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, for [[Chandrakirti|Candrakīrti]], there is a problem with assuming that the Madhyamika and the essentialist opponent can begin with the same shared premises that are required for this kind of syllogistic reasoning because the essentialist and the Madhyamaka do not share a basic understanding of what it means for things to exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Newland, Guy, Introduction to Emptiness: As Taught in Tsong-Kha-Pa's Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path, 2009, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Candrakīrti]] also criticized the Buddhist [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] school, which he saw as positing a form of subjective [[idealism]] due to their doctrine of "appearance only" (''vijñaptimatra''). [[Candrakīrti]] faults the [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] school for not realizing that the nature of consciousness is also a conditioned phenomenon, and for privileging consciousness over its objects ontologically, instead of seeing that ''everything'' is empty.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Candrakīrti]] wrote the ''Prasannapadā'' (Clear Words), a highly influential commentary on the ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'' as well as the ''Madhyamakāvatāra,'' an introduction to Madhyamaka. His works are central to the understanding of Madhyamaka in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

[[Shantideva|Śāntideva]] (end 7th century – first half 8th century) is well known for his [[Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra|''Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra'']], ''A Guide to the [[Bodhisattva]]'s Way of Life''. He united "a deep religiousness and joy of exposure together with the unquestioned Madhyamaka orthodoxy".{{sfn|Rizzi|1988|p=5}}

=== Yogācāra-Madhyamaka ===
The eighth century saw a synthesis of the Buddhist [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] tradition with Madhyamaka, beginning with the work of the Buddhist philosopher [[Jñānagarbha]] and his student [[Śāntarakṣita]] (8th-century) who, like Bhāvaviveka, also adopted some of the terminology of the Buddhist pramana tradition, in their time best represented by [[Dharmakirti|Dharmakīrti]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Like the classical Madhyamaka, Yogācāra-Madhyamaka approaches ultimate truth through the prasaṅga method of showing absurd consequences. However, when speaking of conventional reality they also make positive assertions and autonomous arguments like [[Bhāviveka|Bhāvaviveka]] and [[Dharmakirti|Dharmakīrti]]. [[Śāntarakṣita]] also subsumed the [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] system into his presentation of the conventional, accepting their idealism on a conventional level as a preparation for the ultimate truth of Madhyamaka.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{sfn|Shantarakshita|2005|p=117-122}} In his ''Madhyamakālaṃkāra'' (verses 92-93), [[Śāntarakṣita]] says:&lt;blockquote&gt;By relying on the Mind Only (''cittamatra''), know that external entities do not exist. And by relying on this [Madhyamaka] system, know that no self at all exists, even in that [mind]. Therefore, due to holding the reigns of logic as one rides the chariots of the two systems, one attains [the path of] the actual Mahayanist.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, James, The Ornament of the Middle Way A Study of the Madhyamaka Thought of Santaraksita, Snow Lion, 2004, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Shantarakshita|Śāntarakṣita]] and his student [[Kamalaśīla]] were influential in initial the spread of Madhyamaka to Tibet.{{refn|Alex Trisoglio: "In the 8th century, Shantarakshita went to Tibet and founded the monastery at Samyé. He was not a direct disciple of Bhavaviveka, but the disciple of one of his disciples. He combined the Madhyamika-Svatantrika and Cittamatra schools, and created a new school of Madhyamika called Svatantrika-Yogachara-Madhyamika.  His disciple Kamalashila, who wrote The Stages of Meditation upon Madhyamika (uma’i sgom rim), developed his ideas further, and together they were very influential in Tibet."{{cite book|last=Khyentse Rinpoche|first=Dzongsar Jamyang|title=Introduction to the Middle Way: Chandrakirti's Madhyamakavatara with Commentary|year=2003|publisher=Khyentse Foundation|location=Dordogne, France|pages=8|url=http://www.siddharthasintent.org/|edition=1st|editor=Alex Trisoglio|accessdate=7 January 2013|format=PDF|chapter=Introduction}}|group=note}}

Madhyamaka philosophy obtained a central position in all the main [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] schools, all whom consider themselves to be Madhyamikas. Madhyamaka thought has been categorized in various ways in India and Tibet.{{refn|In his Tattvaratnāvalī, the Indian scholar Advayavajra classified Madhyamaka into "those who uphold non-duality from the simile of illusion" (''māyopamādvayavādin'') and "those who uphold non-placement into any dharma" (''sarvadharmāpratiṣṭhānavādin''); furthermore, in the Madhyamakaṣaṭka he envisaged a specifically Vajrayāna type of Madhyamaka.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}|group=note}}

=== Early transmission ===
Influential early figures who are important in the transmission of Madhyamaka to Tibet include the Yogacara-Madhyamika [[Śāntarakṣita]] (725–788), and his students [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribhadra]] and [[Kamalaśīla|Kamalashila]] (740-795) as well as the later figures of [[Atiśa|Atisha]] (982–1054) and his pupil [[Dromtön]] (1005–1064) who were mainly influenced by [[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]]'s Madhyamaka.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2004, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early transmission of Buddhism to Tibet saw these two main strands of philosophical views in debate with each other. The first was the camp which defended the Yogacara-Madhyamaka interpretation centered on the works of the scholars of the Sangphu monastery founded by [[Ngok Loden Sherab|Ngog Loden Sherab]] (1059-1109) and also includes Chapa Chokyi Senge (1109-1169).&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;Dunne, John D. (2011). "Madhyamaka in India and Tibet." In Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy.” Edited by J. Garfield and W. Edelglass. Oxford: Oxford University Press: 206-221.&lt;/ref&gt; The second camp was those who championed the work of [[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]] over the Yogacara-Madhyamaka interpretation, and included [[Patsab Nyima Drakpa|Patsab Nyima Drag]] (b. 1055) and Jayananda (fl 12th century).&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; According to John Dunne, it was the Madhyamaka interpretation and the works of Candrakirti which became dominant over time in Tibet.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

==== Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika interpretations ====
{{main|Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction}}

In [[Tibet]]an Buddhist scholarship, a distinction began to be made between the Autonomist (''[[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|Svātantrika]], rang rgyud pa'') and Consequentialist (''[[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|Prāsaṅgika]], Thal ’gyur pa'') approaches to Madhyamaka reasoning. The distinction was one invented by Tibetans, and not one made by classical Indian Madhyamikas.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2004, page 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetans mainly use the terms to refer to the logical procedures used by [[Bhavaviveka]] (who argued for the use of ''[[Svatantrika|svatantra-anumana]]'' or autonomous syllogisms) and [[Buddhapalita]] (who held that one should only use ''[[Prasaṅgika|prasanga]]'', or ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'').{{sfn|Shantarakshita|2005|p=131-141}} Tibetan Buddhism further divides ''[[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|svātantrika]]'' into [[Sautrāntika|Sautrantika]] Svātantrika Madhyamaka (applied to [[Bhāviveka]]), and [[Yogachara|Yogācāra]] Svātantrika Madhyamaka ([[Śāntarakṣita]] and [[Kamalaśīla]]).{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=138}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The svātantrika states that conventional phenomena are understood to have a conventional essential existence, but without an ultimately existing essence. In this way they believe they are able to make positive or "autonomous" assertions using syllogistic logic because they are able to share a subject that is established as appearing in common - the proponent and opponent use the same kind of valid cognition to establish it. The name comes from this quality of being able to use autonomous arguments in debate.{{sfn|Shantarakshita|2005|p=131-141}} In contrast, the central technique avowed by the [[Prasaṅgika|{{IAST|prasaṅgika}}]] is to show by ''{{IAST|prasaṅga}}'' (or [[reductio ad absurdum]]) that any positive assertion (such as "asti" or "nāsti", "it is", or "it is not") or [[View (Buddhism)|view]] regarding phenomena must be regarded as merely conventional ({{IAST|saṃvṛti}} or ''lokavyavahāra''). The ''prāsaṅgika'' holds that it is not necessary for the proponent and opponent to use the same kind of valid cognition ([[Pramana|''pramana'']]) to establish a common subject; indeed it is possible to change the view of an opponent through a [[Reductio ad absurdum|reductio]] argument.&lt;/p&gt;Although presented as a divide in doctrine, the major difference between svātantrika and prasangika may be between two style of reasoning and arguing, while the division itself is exclusively Tibetan. Tibetan scholars were aware of alternative Madhyamaka sub-classifications, but later Tibetan doxography emphasizes the nomenclature of prāsaṅgika versus svātantrika. No conclusive evidence can show the existence of an Indian antecedent, and it is not certain to what degree individual writers in Indian and Tibetan discussion held each of these views and if they held a view generally or only in particular instances. Both Prāsaṅgikas and Svātantrikas cited material in the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]] in support of their arguments.{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=27-28}}

The Tibetan [[Longchen Rabjam]] noted in the 14th century that Candrakirti favored the {{IAST|prasaṅga}} approach when specifically discussing the analysis for ultimacy, but otherwise he made positive assertions such as when describing the paths of Buddhist practice in his ''[[Madhyamakāvatāra|Madhyamakavatāra]]''. Therefore even {{IAST|prāsaṅgikas}} make positive assertions when discussing conventional practice, they simply stick to using reductios specifically when analyzing for ultimate truth.{{sfn|Shantarakshita|2005|p=131-141}}

=== Jonang and shentong ===
&lt;p href="#CITEREFChenh1981"&gt;Further Tibetan philosophical developments began in response to the works of the scholar [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|Dölpopa Shérap Gyeltsen]] (1292–1361) and led to two distinctly opposed Tibetan Madhyamaka views on the nature of ultimate reality.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145, 150}}&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Cyrus (2010). ''The Buddha from Dölpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dölpopa Sherab Gyaltsen''(Rev. and enl. ed.). Ithaca, NY: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|9781559393430}}. Retrieved 2 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dolpopa]], founder of the [[Jonang]] school, viewed the Buddha and [[Buddha Nature]] as ''not'' intrinsically empty, but as truly real, unconditioned, and replete with eternal, changeless virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, 2006, pp 8-15&lt;/ref&gt; In the Jonang school, ultimate reality, i.e. Buddha Nature ([[Tathagatagarbha|''tathagatagarbha'']]) is only empty of what is impermanent and conditioned (conventional reality), not of its own self which is ultimate [[Buddhahood]] and the [[Luminous mind|luminous nature of mind]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, Luminous Heart: The Third Karmapa on Consciousness, Wisdom, and Buddha Nature, p 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jonang]], this ultimate reality is a "ground or substratum" which is "uncreated and indestructible, noncomposite and beyond the chain of dependent origination."&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Cyrus (1999), The Buddha from Dolpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, State University of New York Press, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; An important Tibetan treatise on Emptiness and the Buddha Nature is found in [[Dolpopa|Dolpopa's]] voluminous study, ''Mountain Doctrine''.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Basing himself on the Indian &lt;i href="#CITEREFBhattacharya1943"&gt;[[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]&lt;/i&gt; as his main sources, [[Dolpopa]] described the Buddha Nature as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]on-material emptiness, emptiness that is far from an annihilatory emptiness, great emptiness that is the ultimate pristine wisdom of superiors ...Buddha earlier than all Buddhas, ... causeless original Buddha.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=14}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This "great emptiness" i.e. the ''tathāgatagarbha'' is said to be filled with eternal powers and virtues:{{quote|[P]ermanent, stable, eternal, everlasting. Not compounded by causes and conditions, the matrix-of-one-gone-thus is intrinsically endowed with ultimate buddha qualities of body, speech, and mind such as the ten powers; it is not something that did not exist before and is newly produced; it is self-arisen.'{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=8}}}}

The Jonang position came to be known as "emptiness of other" (''gzhan stong, shentong),'' because it held that the ultimate truth was positive reality that was not empty of its own nature, only empty of what it was other than itself.&lt;ref name=":823"&gt;Cabezón, José Ignacio; Lobsang Dargyay, ''Freedom from Extremes Gorampa's "Distinguishing the Views" and the Polemics of Emptiness (Part of Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism)'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Dolpopa considered his view a form of Madhyamaka, and called his system "Great Madhyamaka".&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2004, page 502.&lt;/ref&gt; Dolpopa opposed what he called [[Rangtong-Shentong|rangtong]] (self-empty), the view that ultimate reality is that which is empty of self nature in a relative and absolute sense, that is to say that it is empty of everything, including itself. It is thus not a transcendental ground or metaphysical absolute which includes all the eternal Buddha qualities. This rangtong shentong distinction became a central issue of contention among Tibetan Buddhist philosophers.

Alternative interpretations of the shentong view is also taught outside of Jonang. Some [[Kagyu]] figures, like [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] (1813–1899) as well as the unorthodox [[Sakya]] philosopher [[Sakya Chokden]] (1428–1507), supported their own forms of shentong.

=== Tsongkhapa and Gelug ===
{{See also|Prasaṅgika according to Tsongkhapa}}The [[Gelug|Gelug school]] was founded in the beginning of the 15th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419).{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=207}} Tsongkhapa's conception of emptiness draws mainly from the works of [[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|"prāsaṅgika"]] Indian thinkers like Buddhapalita, Candrakirti, and Shantideva and he argued that only their interpretation of Nagarjuna was ultimately correct. According to José I. Cabezón, Tsongkhapa also argued that the ultimate truth or emptiness was "an absolute negation (''med dgag'')—the negation of inherent existence—and that nothing was exempt from being empty, including emptiness itself."&lt;ref name=":823" /&gt; He also maintained that the ultimate truth could be understood conceptually, an understanding which could later be transformed into a non-conceptual one. However, this could only be done through the use of Madhyamika reasoning, which he also sought to unify with the logical theories of [[Dharmakirti]].&lt;ref name=":823" /&gt; Because of Tsongkhapa's view of emptiness as an absolute negation, he strongly attacked the other empty views of [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|Dolpopa]] in his works. Tsongkhapa major work on Madhyamaka is his commentary on the MMK called "Ocean of Reasoning".{{sfn|rJe Tsong Kha Pa|2006}}

According to [[Thupten Jinpa]], Tsongkhapa's "doctrine of the object of negation" is one of his most innovative but also controversial ideas.&amp;nbsp;Tsongkhapa pointed out that if one wants to steer a middle course between the extremes of "over-negation" (straying into [[nihilism]]) and "under-negation" (and thus [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]]), it is important to have a clear concept of exactly what is being negated in Madhyamaka analysis.&lt;ref name=":172"&gt;Learman, Oliver (editor), Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy, Routledge, 2001, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":182"&gt;Sparham, Gareth, "Tsongkhapa", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/tsongkhapa/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsongkhapa's understanding of the object of negation (Tib. ''dgag bya'') is subtle, and he describes it as an "innate apprehension of self-existence" which Thupten Jinpa glosses as a belief that we have that leads us to "perceive things and events as possessing some kind of intrinsic existence and identity." Tsongkhapa's Madhyamaka therefore, does not deny the conventional existence of things ''per se'', but merely rejects our way of experiencing things as existing in an [[Essentialism|essentialist]] way, which are false projections or imputations.&lt;ref name=":172" /&gt; This is the root of ignorance, which for Tsongkhapa is an "active defiling agency" (Sk. ''kleśāvaraṇa'') which projects a false sense of reality onto objects.&lt;ref name=":172" /&gt; Because conventional existence (or 'mere appearance') as an interdependent phenomenon devoid of inherent existence is not negated (khegs pa) or "rationally undermined" in his analysis, Tsongkhapa's approach was criticized by other Tibetan Madhyamikas who preferred an anti-realist interpretation of Madhyamaka.&lt;ref&gt;Cowherds, Moonshadows: Conventional Truth in Buddhist, Oxford University Press; 1 edition (December 24, 2010), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; As Garfield and Thakchoe note, this allows for a "robust sense of the reality of the conventional world in the context of emptiness".&lt;ref&gt;Cowherds, Moonshadows: Conventional Truth in Buddhist, Oxford University Press; 1 edition (December 24, 2010), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Candrakirti, Tsongkhapa also rejected the [[Yogachara|Yogacara]] view of mind only, and instead defended the conventional existence of external objects even though ultimately they are mere "thought constructions" (Tib. ''rtog pas btags tsam'') of a deluded mind.&lt;ref name=":182" /&gt; Tsongkhapa also followed Candrakirti in rejecting ''svātantra'' (“autonomous”) reasoning, arguing that it was enough to show the unwelcome consequences (''prasaṅga'') of essentialist positions.&lt;ref name=":182" /&gt;

Gelug scholarship has generally maintained and defended Tsongkhapa's positions up until the present day, even if there are lively debates considering issues of interpretation. [[Gendün Chöphel|Gendun Chopel]] and the [[14th Dalai Lama]] are some of the most influential modern figures in Gelug Madhyamaka.

=== Sakya ===
The Sakya school has generally held a classic [[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|prāsaṅgika]] position following [[Chandrakirti|Candrakirti]] closely, though with significant differences from the Gelug. Sakya scholars of Madhyamika, such as Rendawa Shyönnu Lodrö (1349–1412) and Rongtön Sheja Kunrig (1367–1450) were early critics of the "other empty" view.&lt;ref&gt;Cabezón, José Ignacio; Lobsang Dargyay, ''Freedom from Extremes Gorampa's "Distinguishing the Views" and the Polemics of Emptiness (Part of Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism)'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gorampa|Gorampa Sonam Senge]] (1429-1489) was an important philosopher which defended the orthodox [[Sakya]] Madhyamika position, critiquing both Dolpopa and Tsongkhapa's interpretations. He is widely studied, not only in Sakya, but also in Nyingma and Kagyu institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Kassor, Constance, "Gorampa [go rams pa]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/gorampa/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cabezón, Gorampa called his version of Madhyamaka "the Middle Way ''qua'' freedom from extremes" (''mtha’ bral dbu ma'') or "Middle Way ''qua'' freedom from proliferations" (''spros bral kyi dbu ma'') and claimed that the ultimate truth was ineffable, beyond predication or concept.&lt;ref&gt;Cabezón, José Ignacio; Lobsang Dargyay, ''Freedom from Extremes Gorampa's "Distinguishing the Views" and the Polemics of Emptiness (Part of Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism)'', p. 46-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Cabezón states that Gorampa's interpretation of Madhyamaka is "committed to a more literal reading of the Indian sources than either Dolpopa’s or Tsongkhapa’s, which is to say that it tends to take the Indian texts at face value."&lt;ref&gt;Cabezón, José Ignacio; Lobsang Dargyay, ''Freedom from Extremes Gorampa's "Distinguishing the Views" and the Polemics of Emptiness (Part of Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism)'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; For Gorampa, emptiness is not just the absence of inherent existence, but it is the absence of the four extremes in all phenomena i.e. existence, nonexistence, both and neither (see: [[Catuṣkoṭi|''catuskoti'']]), ''without any further qualification''.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;Cabezón, José Ignacio; Lobsang Dargyay, ''Freedom from Extremes Gorampa's "Distinguishing the Views" and the Polemics of Emptiness (Part of Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism)'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, conventional truths are also an object of negation, because as Gorampa states "they are not found at all when subjected to ultimate rational analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Cowherds, Moonshadows: Conventional Truth in Buddhist, Oxford University Press; 1 edition (December 24, 2010), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, in contrast to the view of Tsongkhapa for example, Gorampa's Madhyamaka negates ''existence'' ''itself'', instead of merely negating "ultimate existence" or "inherent existence".&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; As Garfield and Thakchoe note, for Tsongkhapa, conventional truth is "a kind of truth", "a way of being real" while for Gorampa, it is "entirely false", "unreal" and "ruth only from the perspective of fools."&lt;ref&gt;Cowherds, Moonshadows: Conventional Truth in Buddhist, Oxford University Press; 1 edition (December 24, 2010), p. 74, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the Ultimate truth, Gorampa saw this as being divided into two parts:&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The emptiness that is reached by rational analysis (this is actually only an analogue, and not the real thing).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The emptiness that yogis fathom by means of their own individual gnosis, the real ultimate truth, which is reached by negating the previous rational understanding of emptiness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Unlike most orthodox Sakyas, the philosopher [[Sakya Chokden]], a contemporary of Gorampa, also promoted a form of shentong as being complementary to rangtong. He saw shentong as useful for meditative practice, while rangtong as useful for cutting through views.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl; Luminous Heart: The Third Karmapa on Consciousness, Wisdom, and Buddha Nature, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kagyu ===
In the [[Kagyu]] tradition, there is a broad field of opinion on the nature of emptiness, with some holding the other empty view while others holding different positions. One influential Kagyu thinker was [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama]]. His view synthesized Madhyamaka and Yogacara perspectives. According to Brunnholzl, regarding his position in the rangtong shentong debate he "can be said to regard these two as not being mutually exclusive and to combine them in a creative synthesis."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, Luminous Heart: The Third Karmapa on Consciousness, Wisdom, and Buddha Nature, p 99.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama|Rangjung Dorje]] never uses these terms in any of his works and thus any claims to him being a promoter of shentong or otherwise is a later interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, Luminous Heart: The Third Karmapa on Consciousness, Wisdom, and Buddha Nature, p 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Kagyu figures disagree with the view that shentong is a form of Madhyamaka. According to Brunnholzl, [[Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama]] (1507–1554) and [[Pawo Rinpoche|Second Pawo Rinpoche Tsugla Trengwa]] see the term "Shentong Madhyamaka" as a misnomer, for them the Yogacara of Asanga and Vasubandhu and the system of Nagarjuna are "two clearly distinguished systems". They also refute the idea that there is "a permanent, intrinsically existing Buddha nature".&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2004, page 446..&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama|Mikyö Dorje]] also argues that the language of other emptiness does not appear in any of the sutras or the treatises of the Indian masters. He attacks the view of [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|Dolpopa]] as being against the sutras of ultimate meaning which state that all phenomena are emptiness as well as being against the treatises of the Indian masters.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2004, page 447.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama|Mikyö Dorje]] rejects both perspectives of rangtong and shentong as true descriptions of ultimate reality, which he sees as being "the utter peace of all discursiveness regarding being empty and not being empty".&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2004, page 448.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most influential Kagyu philosophers in recent times was [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye]] (1813–1899) who advocated a system of Shentong Madhyamaka and held that primordial wisdom was "never empty of its own nature and it is there all the time".&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, 2004, page 501.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ringu Tulku, The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet 2007, p 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Kagyu teacher [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche|Khenpo Tsultrim]] (1934–), in his ''Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness'', presents five stages of meditation, which he relates to five tenet systems.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=19-26}}{{sfn|Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso|1994}} He holds the "Shentong Madhyamaka" as the highest view, above prasangika. He sees this as a meditation on ''Paramarthasatya'' ("Absolute Reality"),{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=21}}{{refn|According to Hookham, non-dual experience is Ultimate Reality.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}|name="Absolute"|group=note}} ''Buddhajnana'',{{refn|According to Hookham, "The Chinese Tathagarba schools describe Buddhajnana as the totality of all that is, which pervades every part of all that is in its totality."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}} According to Hookham, for Shentong Buddhajnana is "the non-dual nature of Mind completely unobscured and endowed with its countless Buddha Qualities (''Buddhagunas'').{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}|name="Buddhajnana"|group=note}} which is beyond concepts, and described by terms as "truly existing."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} This approach helps "to overcome certain residual subtle concepts,"{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} and "the habit – fosterd on the earlier stages of the path – of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}} It destroys false concepts, as does prasangika, but it also alerts the practitioner "to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}}

=== Nyingma ===
In the [[Nyingma]] school, like in Kagyu, there is a variety of views. Some Nyingma thinkers promoted shentong, like [[Katok Tsewang Norbu]], but the most influential Nyingma thinkers like [[Longchenpa]] and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Ju Mipham]] held a more classical [[Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction|prāsaṅgika]] interpretation while at the same time seeking to harmonize it with the view of [[Dzogchen]] tantras which are traditionally seen as the pinnacle of the Nyingma view.

According to [[Sonam Thakchoe]], the Ultimate truth in the Nyingma tradition, following [[Longchenpa]], is mainly seen as being that "reality which transcends any mode of thinking and speech, one that unmistakenly appears to the nonerroneous cognitive processes of the exalted and awakened beings" and this is said to be "inexpressible beyond words and thoughts" as well as the reality that is the "transcendence of all elaborations.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Thakchoe, Sonam, "The Theory of Two Truths in Tibet", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/twotruths-tibet/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential modern Nyingma scholar is [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]] (1846–1912). He developed a unique theory of Madhyamaka, with two models of the two truths. While the adopts the traditional Madhyamaka model of two truths, in which the ultimate truth is emptiness, he also developed a second model, in which the ultimate truth is "Reality as it is" (''de bzhin nyid'') which is "established as ultimately real" (''bden par grub pa'').&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This ultimate truth is associated with the Dzogchen concept of [[Rigpa]]. While it might seem that this system conflicts with the traditional Madhyamaka interpretation, for Mipham this is not so. For while the traditional model which sees emptiness and ultimate truth as a negation is referring to the analysis of experience, the second Dzogchen influenced model refers to the experience of unity in meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Duckworth sees Mipham's work as an attempt to bring together the two main Mahayana philosophical systems of yogacara and madhyamaka, as well as shentong and rangtong into a coherent system in which both are seen as being of definitive meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the ''svatantrika prasangika'' debate, [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Ju Mipham]] explained that using positive assertions in logical debate may serve a useful purpose, either while debating with non-Buddhist schools or to move a student from a coarser to a more subtle view. Similarly, discussing an approximate ultimate helps students who have difficulty using only ''{{IAST|prasaṅga}}'' methods move closer to the understanding of the true ultimate. Ju Mipham felt that the ultimate non-enumerated truth of the Svatantrika was no different from the ultimate truth of the Prāsaṅgika. He felt the only difference between them was with respect to how they discussed conventional truth and their approach to presenting a path.{{sfn|Shantarakshita|2005|p=131-141}}

== East Asian Madhyamaka ==
=== Sānlùn school ===
[[East Asian Madhyamaka|Chinese Madhyamaka]] (known as ''Sānlùn,'' or the three treatise school) began with the work of [[Kumārajīva]] (344–413 CE) who translated the works of Nāgārjuna (including the MMK, also known in China as the ''Chung lun'', “''Madhyamakaśāstra''”; [[Taishō Tripiṭaka|Taishō]] 1564) to Chinese. Another influential text in Chinese Madhyamaka which was said to have been translated by Kumārajīva was the ''Ta-chih-tu lun'', or *''Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa Śāstra'' (“Treatise which is a Teaching on the Great Perfection of Wisdom [Sūtra]”). According to Dan Arnold, this text is only extant in Kumārajīva's translation and has material that differs from the work of Nāgārjuna. In spite of this, the ''Ta-chih-tu lun'' became a central text for Chinese interpretations of Madhyamaka emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Dan, ''Madhyamaka Buddhist Philosophy'', Internet Encyclopedia of philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sānlùn'' figures like Kumārajīva's pupil [[Sengzhao]] (384–414), and the later [[Jizang]] (549–623) were influential in restoring a more orthodox and non-essentialist interpretation of emptiness to Chinese Buddhism. [[Yin Shun]] (1906–2005) is one modern figure aligned with ''Sānlùn.''

Sengzhao is often seen as the founder of ''Sānlùn.'' He was influenced not just by Indian Madhyamaka and [[Mahayana sutras]] like the [[Vimalakirti Sutra|Vimalakirti]], but also by [[Taoism|Taoist]] works and he widely quotes the [[Tao Te Ching|Lao-tzu]] and the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Chuang-tzu]] and uses terminology of the Neo-Daoist "Mystery Learning" ([[Xuanxue|''xuanxue'']] 玄学) tradition while maintaining a uniquely Buddhist philosophical view.&lt;ref&gt;Liebenthal, Walter, Chao-Lun The Treatises of Seng Chao, 1968, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;Cuma Ozkan, A comparative analysis: Buddhist Madhyamaka and Daoist Chongxuan (twofold mystery) in the early Tang (618-720) University of Iowa, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay "The Emptiness of the Non-Absolute" (''buzhenkong'', 不眞空), Sengzhao points out that the nature of phenomena cannot be taken as being either existent or inexistent:&lt;blockquote href="#CITEREFChenh1981"&gt;Hence, there are indeed reasons why myriad dharmas are inexistent and cannot be taken as existent; there are reasons why [myriad dharmas] are not inexistent and cannot be taken as inexistent. Why? If we would say that they exist, their existent is not real; if we would say that they don’t exist, their phenomenal forms have taken shape. Having forms and shapes, they are not inexistent. Being not real, they are not truly existent. Hence the meaning of bu zhen kong [not really empty, 不眞空] is made manifest.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Sengzhao saw the central problem in understanding emptiness as the discriminatory activity of ''[[Conceptual proliferation|prapañca]].'' According to Sengzhao, delusion arises through a dependent relationship between phenomenal things, naming, thought and reification and correct understanding lies outside of words and concepts. Thus, while emptiness is the lack of intrinsic self in all things, this emptiness is not itself an absolute and cannot be grasped by the conceptual mind, it can be only be realized through non-conceptual wisdom (''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajña]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Dippmann, Jeffrey, Sengzhao (Seng-Chao c. 378—413 C.E.), Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jizang]] (549–623) was another central figure in Chinese Madhyamaka who wrote numerous commentaries on Nagarjuna and Aryadeva and is considered to be the leading representative of the school.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;Fox, Alan, Self-reflection in the Sanlun Tradition: Madhyamika as the "Deconstructive Conscience" of Buddhism, Journal of Chinese Philosophy V. 19 (1992) pp. 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jizang]] called his method "deconstructing what is misleading and revealing what is corrective". He insisted that one must never settle on any particular viewpoint or perspective but constantly reexamine one's formulations to avoid reifications of thought and behavior.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; In his commentary on the MMK, Jizang's method and understanding of emptiness can be seen:&lt;blockquote href="#CITEREFRenard2010"&gt;The Abhidharma thinkers regard the four holy truths as true. The Satyasiddhi regards merely the truth of cessation of suffering, i.e., the principle of emptiness and equality, as true. The southern Mahāyāna tradition regards the principle that refutes truths as true, and the northern [Mahāyāna tradition] regards thatness [suchness] and prajñā as true… Examining these all together, if there is a single [true] principle, it is an eternal view, which is false. If there is no principle at all, it is an evil view, which is also false. Being both existent and non-existent consists of the eternal and nihilistic views altogether. Being neither existent nor nonexistent is a foolish view. One replete with these four phrases has all [wrong] views. One without these four phrases has a severe nihilistic view. Now that [one] does not know how to name what a mind has nothing to rely upon and is free from conceptual construction, [he] foists “thatness” [suchness] upon it, one attains sainthood of the three vehicles… Being deluded in regard to thatness [suchness], one falls into the six realms of disturbed life and death.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;In one of his early treatises called "The Meaning of the two Truths" (''Erdiyi''), Jizang, expounds the steps to realize the nature of the ultimate truth of emptiness as follows:&lt;blockquote href="#CITEREFBhattacharya1943"&gt;In the first step, one recognises reality of the phenomena on the conventional level, but assumes their non-reality on the ultimate level. In the second step, one becomes aware of Being or Non-Being on the conventional level and negates both at the ultimate level. In the third step, one either asserts or negates Being and Non-Being on the conventional level, neither confi rming nor rejecting them on the ultimate level. Hence, there is ultimately no assertion or negation anymore; therefore, on the conventional level, one becomes free to accept or reject anything.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Chán ===
The [[Zen|Chán/Zen-tradition]] emulated Madhyamaka-thought via the San-lun Buddhists, influencing its supposedly "illogical" way of communicating "absolute truth."{{sfn|Cheng|1981}} The Madhyamika of Sengzhao for example, influenced the views of the Chan patriarch [[Shenhui|Shen Hui]] (670-762), a critical figure in the development of Chan, as can be seen by his "Illuminating the Essential Doctrine" (''Hsie Tsung Chi''). This text emphasizes that true emptiness or [[Tathātā|Suchness]] cannot be known through thought since it is free from thought (''wu-nien''):&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Zeuschner, Robert B., ''The Hsie Tsung Chi (An Early Ch'an (Zen) Buddhist Text)'' Journal of Chinese Philosophy V. 3 (1976) pp. 253-268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote href="#CITEREFHayes2003"&gt;Thus we come to realize that both selves and things are, in their essence, empty, and existence and non-existence both disappear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote href="#CITEREFHayes2003"&gt;Mind is fundamentally non-action; the way is truly no-thought (''wu-nien'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no thought, no reflection, no seeking, no attainment, no this, no that, no coming, no going.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Shen Hui also states that true emptiness is not nothing, but it is a "Subtle Existence" (''miao-yu''), which is just "Great Prajña." &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Western Buddhism==

===Thich Nhat Hanh===

[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] explains the Madhyamaka concept of emptiness through the related concept of interdependence. In this analogy, there is no first or ultimate cause for anything that occurs. Instead, all things are dependent on innumerable causes and conditions that are themselves dependent on innumerable causes and conditions. The interdependence of all phenomena, including the self, is a helpful way to undermine mistaken views about inherence, or that one's self is inherently existent. It is also a helpful way to discuss Mahayana teachings on motivation, compassion, and ethics. The comparison to interdependence has produced recent discussion comparing Mahayana ethics to environmental ethics.{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1988}}

===Modern Madhyamaka===

Madhyamaka forms an alternative to the perennialist and essentialist (neo-)Advaita understanding of [[nondualism]] or modern spirituality.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.emptiness.co/ Emptiness.

== Influences and critiques ==

=== Yogacara ===
The [[Yogachara|Yogacara]] school was the other major Mahayana philosophical school (darsana) in India and its complex relationship with Madhyamaka changed over time. The [[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhinirmocana sūtra]], perhaps the earliest Yogacara text, proclaims itself as being above the doctrine of emptiness taught in other sutras. According to Paul Williams, the Saṃdhinirmocana claims that other sutras that teach emptiness as well as Madhyamika teachings on emptiness are merely skillful means and thus are not definitive, like the teachings in the Saṃdhinirmocana.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul, Mahayana Buddhism, the doctrinal foundations, 2009, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; As Mark Siderits points out, Yogacara authors like [[Asanga]] were careful to point out that the doctrine of emptiness required interpretation in lieu of their three natures theory which posits an inexpressible ultimate that is the object of a Buddha's cognition.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;Garfield, Jay L. Westerhoff, Jan, Madhyamaka and Yogacara, allies or rivals? p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Asanga also argued that one cannot say that all things are empty unless there ''are'' things to be seen as either empty or non-empty in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay L. Westerhoff, Jan, Madhyamaka and Yogacara, allies or rivals? p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Asanga attacks the view which states "The truth is that all is just conceptual fictions” by stating:&lt;blockquote href="Analytic philosophy"&gt;As for their view, due to the absence of the thing itself which serves as basis of the concept, conceptual fictions must all likewise absolutely not exist. How then will it be true that all is just conceptual fictions? Through this conception on their part, reality, conceptual fiction, and the two together are all denied. Because they deny both conceptual fiction and reality, they should be considered the nihilist-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/teachers/wheeler_ramesam.htm Dr. Vemuri Ramesam, ''A Critique Of John Wheeler’s “You Were Never Born”'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Asanga]] also critiqued Madhyamaka because he held that it could lead to a laxity in the following of ethical precepts as well as for being "imaginatively constructed views that are arrived at only through reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay L. Westerhoff, Jan, Madhyamaka and Yogacara, allies or rivals? p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; He further states:&lt;blockquote href="Jay L. Garfield"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How, again, is emptiness wrongly conceptualized? Some ascetics and Brahmins do not acknowledge that [viz. intrinsic nature] of which something is empty. Nor do they acknowledge that which is empty [viz. things and dharmas]. It is in this way that emptiness is said to be wrongly conceived. For what reason? Because that of which it is empty is non-existent, but that which is empty is existent— it is thus that emptiness is possible. What will be empty of what, where, when everything is unreal? This thing’s being devoid of that is not [then] possible. Thus emptiness is wrongly conceptualized in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Asanga also wrote that "if nothing is real, there cannot be any ideas (''prajñapti''). Someone who holds this view is a nihilist, with whom one should not speak or share living quarters. This person falls into a bad rebirth and takes others with him."&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay L. Westerhoff, Jan, Madhyamaka and Yogacara, allies or rivals? p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasubandhu]] also states that emptiness does not mean that things have no intrinsic nature, but that this nature is "inexpressible and only to be apprehended by a kind of cognition that transcends the subject-object duality."&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; Thus early Yogacarins were engaged in a project to reinterpret the radical Madhyamaka view of emptiness. Later Yogacarins like [[Sthiramati]] and [[Dharmapala of Nalanda|Dharmapala]] debated with their Madhyamika contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul, Mahayana Buddhism, the doctrinal foundations, 2009, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Yogacara authors also commented on Madhyamika texts. As noted by Garfield, "Asaṅga, Sthiramati, and Guṇamati composed commentaries on the foundational text of Madhyamaka, Nāgārjuna’s ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā''."&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay L. Westerhoff, Jan, Madhyamaka and Yogacara, allies or rivals? p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Xuanzang]], [[Bhāviveka|Bhavaviveka]], who critiques Yogacara views in his ''Madhyamakahṛdayakārikāḥ'', was disturbed by the views of Yogacarins and their critiques of Madhyamaka as nihilism, and himself traveled to [[Nalanda]] to debate Dharmapala face to face, but Dharmapala refused.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay L. Westerhoff, Jan, Madhyamaka and Yogacara, allies or rivals? p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Bhavaviveka quotes the attacks from the Yogacarins in his texts as claiming that while the Yogacara approach to prajñaparamita is the "means to attain omniscience", the Madhyamaka approach which "concentrates on the negation of arising and cessation" is not.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay L. Westerhoff, Jan, Madhyamaka and Yogacara, allies or rivals? p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Bhavaviveka responds to various Yogacara attacks and views in his ''Tarkajvālā'' (Blaze of reason) including the view that there are no external objects ([[idealism]]), the view that there is no use for logical argumentation (''tarka''),  and the view that the dependent nature (''paratantra-svabhāva'') exists in an absolute sense.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, Jay L. Westerhoff, Jan, Madhyamaka and Yogacara, allies or rivals? p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advaita Vedanta ===
Several modern scholars have argued that the early [[Advaita Vedanta]] thinker [[Gaudapada]] (c.6th century CE), was influenced by Madhyamaka thought. They note that he borrowed the concept of "ajāta" (un-born) from Madhyamaka philosophy,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} which also uses the term "anutpāda" (non-arising, un-originated, non-production).{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}}&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=anutpAda+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Anutpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist tradition usually uses the term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} or [[sunyata]].{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=160}}{{refn|The term is also used in the [[Lankavatara Sutra]].{{sfn|Suzuki|1999}} According to D.T Suzuki, "anutpada" is not the opposite of "utpada", but transcends opposites. It is the [[Kensho|seeing into the true nature of existence]],{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=123-124}} the seeing that "all objects are without self-substance".{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=168}}|group=note}} "Ajātivāda" is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of [[Gaudapada]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} According to Gaudapada, the Absolute ([[Brahman]]) is not subject to birth, change and death. Echoing Nagarjuna's use of the [[Catuṣkoṭi|catuskoti]], Gaudapada writes that "nothing whatsoever is originated either from itself or from something else; nothing whatsoever existent, non-existent, or both existent and non-existent is originated."&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;Ben-Ami Scharfstein, A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant, p 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has been noted that Gaudapada's ultimate philosophical perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna's in that Gaudapada posits a metaphysical absolute based on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] and thus he remains primarily a [[Vedanta|Vedantin]].{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} The empirical [[world]] of [[Phenomenon|appearances]] is considered unreal, and not [[Existence|absolutely existent]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} In this sense, Gaudapada also shares a doctrine of [[Two truths doctrine|two truths]] or two levels of reality with Madhyamaka. According to Gaudapada, this absolute, [[Brahman]], cannot undergo alteration, so the phenomenal world cannot arise from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, then the world has to be an unreal{{refn|C.q. "transitory"|group=note}} appearance of Brahman. From the level of ultimate truth (''paramārthatā'') the phenomenal world is ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'' (illusion).{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}

Richard King notes that the fourth prakarana of the ''Gaudapadiyakarika'' promotes several Mahayana Buddhist ideas, such as a [[Middle Way|middle way]] free from extremes, not being attached to dharmas and it even references beings called "Buddhas". King notes that this could be an attempt to either reach a [[rapprochement]] with Buddhists or to woo Buddhists over to Vedanta.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;King, Richard, Early Advaita and Madhyamaka Buddhism: The case of the ''Gaudapadiyakarika.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, King adds that "from a Madhyamaka perspective, the ''Gaudapadiyakarika''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s acceptance of an unchanging Absolute supporting the world of appearances is a mistaken form of eternalism, despite Gaudapadian protestations to the contrary."&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] (early 8th century), a later Advaitin, directly dismissed Madhyamaka as irrational and nihilistic, stating that it was a kind of nihilism that held that "absolutely nothing exists" and that this view:&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Joseph Darling, An Evaluation of the Vedāntic Critique of Buddhism p 358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Reynolds, Eric T. On the relationship of Advaita Vedanta and Madhyamika Buddhism, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;is contradicted by all means of right knowledge and requires no special refutation. For this apparent world, whose existence is guaranteed by all means of knowledge, cannot be denied, unless some one should find out some new truth (based on which he could impugn its existence) - for a general principle is proved by the absence of contrary instances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This critique was upheld by most post Shankara Advaitins. However this did not prevent later [[Vedanta]] thinkers like [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]] of accusing Shankara of being a crypto-buddhist for his view that everyday reality is Maya and that [[Brahman]] has no qualities and is undifferentiated. Another Vedantin philosopher, [[Ramanuja]] (1017–1137), directly compared Shankara's "mayavada" views to Madhyamaka, arguing that if [[Maya (religion)|Maya]]/[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]] is unreal, "that would involve the acceptance of the Madhyamika doctrine, viz. of a general void".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This critique by comparison is also echoed by the later philosophers like [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] as well as [[Vijnanabhiksu|Vijñanabhiksu]] (15th or 16th century), who goes as far as to call Shankara a [[Āstika and nāstika|nastika]] (unorthodox). Later Advaitins also acknowledged the similarity of their doctrine with Madhyamaka. Vimuktatma states that if by ''asat'' (nonbeing), the Madhyamaka means Maya and not mere negation, then he is close to Vedanta. Sadananda also states that if by [[Śūnyatā|Sunya]], what is meant is the reality beyond the intellect, then the Madhyamaka accepts Vedanta. [[Shriharsha|Sri Harsha]] notes that the two schools are similar, but they differ in that Advaita holds consciousness to be pure, real and eternal, while Madhyamaka denies this.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Jain philosophy ===
Modern scholars such as Jeffery Long have also noted that the influential [[Jain philosophy|Jain]] philosopher [[Kundakunda]] also adopted a theory of [[Two truths doctrine|two truths]], possibly under the influence of Nagarjuna.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Jeffery; Jainism: An Introduction, page 66, 216.&lt;/ref&gt; According to W. J. Johnson he also adopts other Buddhist terms like [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajña]] under the influence of Nagarjuna, though he applies the term to knowledge of the Self (jiva), which is also the ultimate perspective (''niścayanaya),'' which is distinguished from the worldly perspective (''vyavahāranaya'')''.''&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Johnson, Harmless Souls: Karmic Bondage and Religious Change in Early Jainism with Special Reference to Umāsvāti and Kundakunda, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1995, p 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain philosopher [[Haribhadra]] also mentions Madhyamaka. In both the ''Yogabindu'' and the [[Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya|''Yogadrstisamuccaya'']], Haribhadra singles out Nagarjuna's claim that [[Saṃsāra|samsara]] and [[nirvana]] are not different for criticism, labeling the view a "fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, Christopher Key, John Thomas Casey (Translator), Reconciling Yogas: Haribhadra's Collection of Views on Yoga With a New Translation of Haribhadra's Yogadrstisamuccaya, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taoism ===
It is well known that medieval Chinese [[Taoism]] was influenced by Mahayana Buddhism. One particular school, the Chongxuan (重玄, "Twofold Mystery") founded by Cheng Xuanying (fl.632-650), was particularly involved in borrowing and adapting Madhyamaka concepts like emptiness, the two truths and the [[Catuṣkoṭi|catuskoti]] into their [[Taoist philosophy|Taoist philosophical]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Cuma Ozkan, A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: BUDDHIST MADHYAMAKA AND DAOIST CHONGXUAN (TWOFOLD MYSTERY) IN THE EARLY TANG (618-720), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern scholarship ==

As noted by Ruegg, Western scholarship has given a broad variety of interpretations of Madhyamaka, including: "[[nihilism]], [[monism]], [[Irrationality|irrationalism]], [[misology]], [[agnosticism]], [[Skepticism|scepticism]], criticism, dialectic, [[mysticism]], [[acosmism]], [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolutism]], [[relativism]], [[nominalism]], and linguistic analysis with therapeutic value".{{sfn|Ruegg|1981|p=2}} [[Jay L. Garfield]] likewise notes:{{quote|"Modern interpreters differ among themselves about the correct way to read it as least as much as canonical interpreters. Nagarjuna has been read as an idealist (Murti 1960), a nihilist (Wood 1994), a skeptic (Garfield 1995), a pragmatist (Kalupahana 1986), and as a mystic (Streng 1967). He has been regarded as a critic of logic (Inada 1970), as a defender of classical logic (Hayes 1994), and as a pioneer of paraconsistent logic (Garfield and Priest 2003)".{{sfn|Garfield and Samten|2006|p=xx}}|sign=|source=}}

These interpretations "reflect almost as much about the viewpoints of the scholars involved as do they reflect the content of Nāgārjuna's concepts".{{sfn|Daye|1971|p=77}}

According to Andrew Tuck, the Western study of Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka can be divided into three phases:&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

#The [[Kantianism|Kantian]] phase, exemplified by [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy|Theodore Stcherbatsky]]’s "The Conception of Buddhist Nirvāna" (1927) who argued that Nagarjuna divides the world into appearance (samsara) and an absolute noumenal reality (nirvana). This is also seen in T. R. V. Murti’s 1955 "The Central Philosophy of Buddhism".&lt;li&gt;The analytic phase, exemplified by Richard Robinson’s 1957 article “Some Logical Aspects of Nāgārjuna’s System”, sought to explain Madhyamaka using [[analytic philosophy]]'s [[logic]]al apparatus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The post-Wittgensteinian phase, exemplified by Frederick Streng’s "Emptiness" and  Chris Gudmunsen’s "Wittgenstein and Buddhism", "set out to stress similarities between Nāgārjuna and in particular the later [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and his criticism of analytic philosophy.
&lt;/li&gt;

The Sri Lankan philosopher [[David Kalupahana]] meanwhile saw Madhyamaka as a response to certain essentialist philosophical tendencies which had arisen after the time of the Buddha and sees it as a restoration of the early Buddhist middle way [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] position.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}&lt;p&gt;Among the critical voices, [[Richard Hayes (professor)|Richard P. Hayes]] (influenced by Richard Robinson's view that Nagarjuna's logic fails modern tests for validity) interprets the works of Nagarjuna as "primitive" and guilty "errors in reasoning" such as that of [[equivocation]]. Hayes states that Nagarjuna was relying on the different meanings of the word ''svabhava'' to make statements which were not logical and that his work relies on various "fallacies and tricks".{{sfn|Hayes|2003|p=3-5}}&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;C. W. Huntington, Jr., The nature of the Madhyamika trick, J Indian Philos (2007) 35:103–131 DOI 10.1007/s10781-007-9018-4&lt;/ref&gt; William Magee strongly disagrees with Hayes, referring to Tsonghkhapa's interpretation of Nagarjuna to argue that Hayes misidentifies Nagarjuna's understanding of the different meanings of the term ''svabhava.''&lt;ref&gt;Magee, 1999, p. 126, "Hayes is misidentifying Nagarjuna's intended meaning of ''svabhava''. In contradistinction to Hayes' belief that Nagarjuna speaks equivocably of an identity nature and a causally independent, non-existent nature, Dzong-ka-ba feels that in chapter XV.1-2 Nagarjuna uses the term ''svabhava'' to refer to an existent emptiness nature."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many recent western scholars (such as Garfield,{{sfn|Garfield|1995}} Napper,{{sfn|Napper|1989}} Hopkins,{{sfn|Hopkins|1996}}) have tended to adopt a [[Gelug]] Prāsaṅgika influenced interpretation of Madhyamaka. However, American philosopher Mark Siderits is one exception, who has attempted to defend the Svātantrika position as a coherent and rational interpretation of Madhyamaka.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits, Mark, Studies in Buddhist philosophy, p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

C.W. Huntington meanwhile has been particularly critical of the modern Western attempt to read Nagarjuna "through the lens of modern [[Modern logic|symbolic logic]]" and to see him as compatible with [[Analytic philosophy|analytical philosophy]]'s logical system.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; He argues that in reading Nagarjuna, a thinker who he sees as "profoundly distrustful of logic", in an overly logical manner, we "prejudice our understanding of Nagarjuna’s insistence that he has no proposition (''pratijña'')."&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; He puts forth a more literary interpretation that focuses on the ''effect'' Nagarjuna was attempting to "conjure" on his readers (i.e. an experience of having no [[View (Buddhism)|views]]) instead of asking how it works (or doesn't) in a logical manner.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; In response to this, [[Jay L. Garfield|Jay Garfield]] defends the logical reading of Nagarjuna through the use of Anglo-American analytical philosophy as well as arguing that "Nagarjuna and Candrakirti deploy arguments, take themselves to do so, and even if they did not, we would be wise to do so in commenting on their texts".&lt;ref name="Garﬁeld, Jay L 2008"/&gt;

Another recent interpreter, [[Jan Westerhoff]], argues that Madhyamaka is a kind of [[anti-foundationalism]], "which does not just deny the objective, intrinsic, and mind-independent existence of some class of objects, but rejects such existence for any kinds of objects that we could regard as the most fundamental building-blocks of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Oxford University Press; 1 edition (February 23, 2009), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14536">'''Metaphysical terms in René Guénon's works''' contains the definition of some [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] terms used in [[René Guénon]]'s writings.

In his metaphysical writings, René Guénon has stated precise definitions concerning key terms in [[metaphysics]]. This article summarizes some of them. Guénon's writings make use of words and terms, of fundamental signification, which receive a precise definition throughout his books. These terms and words, although receiving a usual meaning and being used in many branches of human sciences, have, according to René Guénon, lost substantially their original signification (e.g. words such as "metaphysics", "initiation", "mysticism", "personality", "form", "matter").&lt;ref&gt;c.f. for instance ''The Eastern Metaphysics'' and ''[[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'' w.r.t. the meaning of the word "metaphysics", the first chapter of ''The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times'' on the meanings of the words "form" and "matter", the chapter "Kundalini-Yoga" in his ''Studies on Hinduism'' about the translation of Sanskrit word  ''samâdhi'' as "ecstasy", ''Man and his Becoming according to Vedânta" on the word "personality", ''Theosophism: History of a Pseudo-Religion" on the word "theosophy" etc.&lt;/ref&gt; This article provides the definition given by René Guénon to some of the words used extensively in his works.

==Definitions==

|-
|'''Metaphysics'''
|
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="It may now be stated that metaphysics [...] is essentially the knowledge of the Universal, or, if preferred, the knowledge of the principles belonging to the universal order, which moreover alone can validly lay claim to the name of principles; but in making this statement, we are not really trying to propose a definition of metaphysics, for such a thing is a sheer impossibility by reason of that very universality which we look upon as the foremost of its characteristics, the one from which all the other are derived. In reality, only something that is limited is capable of definition, whereas by definition metaphysics is on the contrary by its very nature absolutely unlimited, and this plainly does not allow our enclosing it in a more or less narrow formula [...]."|source=''[[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'', part II, « The general characteristics of eastern thought », chapter V: « Essential characters of metaphysics », p. 70.
}}
|-
|'''Identity of the knowing and being'''
|
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="Metaphysics affirms the fundamental identity of knowing and being [...] and since this identity is essentially implied of the very nature of intellectual intuition, it not merely affirms it but realizes it as well."|source=''Introduction to the study of the Hindu doctrines'', p. 155.
}}
|-
|'''[[Initiation]] and mysticism'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="Today the esoteric or initiatic domain and the mystical domain&amp;nbsp;– or, if one prefers, their respective points of view&amp;nbsp;– are often confused [...]. it is currently the fashion so to speak among those with limited horizons to construe all Eastern doctrines as 'mystical', including those that lack even a semblance of the outward aspects that could justify such an attribution [...]. [...] in everything pertaining to initiation there is really nothing vague or nebulous, for on the contrary it is as precise and 'positive' as can be, so that initiation by its very nature is in fact incompatible with mysticism."|source=''Perspectives on initiation'', chapter 1: « The initiatic and mystical paths », p. 8.
}}
|-
|'''[[Initiation]]'''
|
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] initiation is essentially the transmission of a spiritual influence, a transmission that can only take place through a regular, traditional organization, so that one cannot speak of initiation outside of an affiliation with an organization of this kind. We have explained that 'regularity' must be understood to exclude all pseudo-initiatic organizations, which, regardless of pretention and outward appearance, in no way possess any spiritual influence and thus are incapable of transmitting anything."|source=''Perspectives on initiation'', chapter 8: « Initiatic transmission », p. 48.
}}
|-
|The '''Self'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The 'Self' is the transcendent and permanent principle of which the manifested being, the human being, for example, is only a transient and contingent modification, a modification which, moreover, can in no way affect the principle [...] The 'Self', as such, is never individualized and cannot become so, for since it must always be considered under the aspect of the eternity and immutability which are the necessary attributes of pure Being, it is obviously not susceptible of any particularization, which would cause it to be 'other that itself'. Immutable in its own nature, it develops the indefinite possibilities which it contains within itself, by a relative passing from potency to act through an indefinite series of degrees. Its essential permanence is not thereby affected, precisely because this process is only relative, and because this development is, strictly speaking, not a development at all, except from the point of view of manifestation, outside of which there is no question of succession, but only of perfect simultaneity, so that even what is virtual under one aspect, is found nevertheless to be realized in the 'eternal present'."|source=''[[Man and his Becoming according to the Vedanta]]'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 23.
}}
|-
|'''[[Paramatman|Paramâtmâ]], individuality, personality'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] Previously, on the contrary [i.e. prior to the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosphists]]], even in the West, whenever any distinction has been made between these two terms ['individuality' or 'ego' and 'personality'] the personality has always been regarded as superior to individuality [...] The 'Self' [...] considered in relation to a being, is properly speaking the personality; it is true that one might restrict the use of this latter word to the 'Self' as principle of the manifested states, just as the 'Divine Personality', '''[[Ishvara|Ishwara]]''', is the Principle of universal Manifestation; but one can also extend it analogically to the 'Self' as principle of all states of the being, both manifested and unmanifested. The personality is an immediate determination, primordial and non-particularized, of the principle which in Sanskrit is called '''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atmâ]]''' or '''[[Paramatman|Paramâtmâ]]''', and which, in default of a better term, we may call the 'Universal Spirit', on the clear understanding, however, that in this use of the word 'spirit', nothing is implied that might recall Western philosophical conceptions, and, in particular, that is not turned into a correlative of 'matter', as the modern mind is inclined to do, being subject in this respect, even though unconsciously, to the influence of Cartesian dualism."|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 24.
}}
|-
|'''Universal and individual'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The 'Self', in relation to any being whatsoever, is in reality identical with Atmâ, since it is essentially beyond all distinction and all particularization; and that is why, in Sanskrit, the same word âtman, in cases other than the nominative, replaces the reflexive pronoun 'itself'. The 'Self is not therefore really distinct from Atmâ, except when one considers it [...] in relation to a certain definite state of being, such as the human state [...]. In this case, moreover, the 'Self' does not really become distinct from Atmâ in any way, since [...] it [...] cannot be affected by the point of view from which we regard it [...]. What should be noted is that to the extent that we make this distinction, we are departing from the direct consideration of the 'Self' in order to consider its reflection in human individuality [...]. The reflection in question determines what may be called the center of this individuality; but if isolated from its principle, that is, from the 'Self', it can only enjoy a purely illusory existence, for it is from that principle that it derives all its reality, and it effectually possesses this reality only through participation in the nature of the 'Self', that is, insofar as it is identified therewith by universalization. &lt;br /&gt;
The personality [...] belongs essentially to the order of principles in the strictest sense of the word, that is, to the universal order [...]. [The] following table [...] sets forth the essential distinctions in this connection [...]:"&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:R Guenon Universal.png]]|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », pp. 26-27.
}}
|-
|'''Manifestation and non-manifestation'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] the Universal will [not only] consist solely of the unmanifested, but will also extend to the formless, comprising both the unmanifested and the supra-individual states of manifestation. As for the individual, it includes all degrees of formal manifestation, that is, all states in which beings are invested with forms, for what properly characterizes individuality and essentially constitutes it as such is precisely the presence of form among the limitative conditions which define and determine a given state of existence. We can now sum up these further considerations in the following table:"&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:R Guenon Manifestation.png]]|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 27.
}}
&lt;br/&gt;Note: in another text, René Guénon will identify what is called here '''formless manifestation''', or '''formless states of being''', with certain ''angelic states'', as they are called in religious (exoteric) formulations.
|-
|'''The human state of being'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="The "gross state" in fact is nothing else than the corporeal existence itself, to which [...] human individuality belongs by one of its modalities only, and not in its integral development. As to the "subtle state", it includes, in the first place, the extra-corporeal modalities of the human being, or of every other being situated in the same state of existence, and also, in the second place, all other individual states [...] It may be said, therefore, that the human being, considered in its integrality, comprises a certain sum of possibilities which constitute its corporeal or gross modality, and in addition, a multitude of other possibilities, which, extending in different directions beyond the corporeal modality, constitute its subtle modalities; but all these possibilities together represent, nonetheless, one and the same degree of universal Existence. It [[Logical consequence|follows from]] this that human individuality is at once much more and much less than Westerners generally suppose it to be: much more, because they recognize in it scarcely anything except the corporeal modality, which includes but the smallest fraction of its possibilities; much less, however, because this individuality, far from really constituting the whole being, is but one state of that being among an indefinite multitude of other states. Moreover the sum of all these states is still nothing at all in relation to the personality, which alone is the true being, because it alone represents its permanent and unconditioned state, and because there is nothing else which can be considered as absolutely real."|source=''Man and his becoming according to the Vedânta'', chapter 2: « Fundamental distinction between the 'Self' and the 'ego' », p. 28.
}}
|-
|'''Samâdhi and ecstasy'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] let us also point out the impropriety of translating samâdhi as "ecstasy", this latter being all the more irksome as it is normally used in Western languages to designate mystical states, that is to say something of an altogether different order, with which it must not be confused; its etymological signification moreover is "to go out of oneself" (which suits very well the case of mystical states), whereas what the term samâdhi designates is quite to the contrary a "return" of the being into its own Self."|source=''Studies in Hinduism'', chapter 3: « Kundalinî Yoga », note 3, pp. 17-18.
}}
|-
|'''Form, matter, essence and substance'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="Understood [...] with reference to particular beings, essence and substance are in effect the same as the "form and "matter" of the scholastic philosophers; but it is better to avoid the use of these latter terms because, doubtless owing to an imperfection of the Latin language in this connection, they only convey rather inaccurately the ideas they ought to express [...]"|source=''The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of Times'', chapter 1: « Quality and Quantity », p. 12.
}}
|-
|'''Matter and the principle of individuation'''
|{{Quote box|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=left|quote="[...] the individuals of any one species all participate in a common nature, which is that of the species itself, and is in all of them equally; how then does it come about that, in spite of this community of nature, these individuals are distinct beings, or even that they are in any way distinguishable one from another ? [...] the question could [...] be formulated in this way: of what order is the determination which is added to specific nature so that individuals may become separate beings while remaining within the species ?It is this determination that the scholastics relate to "matter", that is to say ultimately to quantity [...] and thus "matter" or quantity appears distinctly as a principle of "separativity"."|source=''The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of Times'', chapter 6: « The Principle of Individuation », p. 47.

[[File:Birth Places of Chinese Philosophers.png|300px|thumb|Birth places of notable Chinese philosophers from Hundred Schools of Thought in Zhou Dynasty. Philosophers of Mohism are marked by triangles in blue.]]
'''Mohism''' or '''Moism''' ({{zh|c=墨家|p=Mòjiā|l=School of Mo}}) was an [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese philosophy]] of [[logic]], [[rational]] thought and [[science]] developed by the [[academic]] [[scholars]] who studied under the ancient Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] (c. 470 BC – c. 391 BC) and embodied in an eponymous book: the ''[[Mozi (book)|Mozi]]''. It evolved at about the same time as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]], and was one of the four main [[Hundred Schools of Thought|philosophic schools]] from around 770–221 BC (during the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States period|Warring States]] periods). During that time, Mohism was seen as a major rival to Confucianism. Although its influence endured, Mohism all but disappeared as an independent school of thought.

==Overview==
{{seealso|Mozi (book)}}
Mohism is best known for the concepts of "impartial care" ({{zh|c=兼愛 |p=jiān ài |l=inclusive love/care}}). This is often translated and popularized as "Universal Love", which is misleading as Mozi believed that the essential problem of human ethics was an excess of partiality in compassion, not a deficit in compassion as such. His aim was to re-evaluate behaviour, not emotions or attitudes.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Edited by Edward Craig. Routledge Publishing. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mohists formed a highly structured political organization that tried to realize the ideas they preached, the writings of Mozi. Like Confucians, they hired out their services not only for gain, but also in order to realize their own ethical ideals. This political structure consisted of a network of local units in all the major kingdoms of China at the time, made up of elements from both the scholarly and working classes. Each unit was led by a ''juzi'' (literally, "chisel"—an image from craft making). Within the unit, a frugal and ascetic lifestyle was enforced. Each ''juzi'' would appoint his own successor. Mohists developed the sciences of [[fortification]]{{clarify|date=January 2016}}&lt;!-- the target article is mostly about a building type, not art --&gt; and statecraft, and wrote treatises on government, ranging in topic from efficient agricultural production to the laws of inheritance. They were often hired by the many warring kingdoms as advisers to the state. In this way, they were similar to the other wandering philosophers and knights-errant of the period.

===Caring and impartiality===
{{See also|Love#Chinese and other Sinic cultures}}
Mohism promotes a philosophy of impartial caring; that is, a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her.&lt;ref name=philosophers/&gt; The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the [[Confucian]]s, who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.

Mozi is known for his insistence that all people are equally deserving of receiving material benefit and being protected from physical harm. In Mohism, morality is defined not by tradition and ritual, but rather by a constant moral guide that parallels [[utilitarianism]]. Tradition varies from culture to culture, and human beings need an extra-traditional guide to identify which traditions are morally acceptable. The moral guide must then promote and encourage social behaviours that maximize the general utility of all the people in that society. 

The concept of ''Ai'' (愛) was developed by the Chinese philosopher Mozi in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love. Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of "universal love" (jiān'ài, 兼愛). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally. Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations. Later in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the term ''Ai'' (愛) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, ''Ai'' was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.

===State consequentialism===
{{Main article|Mohist consequentialism}}

{{quote box|quote=It is the business of the benevolent man to seek to promote what is beneficial to the world and to eliminate what is harmful, and to provide a model for the world. What benefits he will carry out; what does not benefit men he will leave alone.&lt;ref name="Mozi"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = [[Mozi|Mo, Di]] |author2 = [[Xun Kuang|Xun, Kuang]] |author3 = [[Han Fei|Han, Fei]] |editor = [[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] |title = Basic Writings of Mo Tzu, Hsün Tzu, and Han Fei Tzu |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TotJdL_zx9YC&amp;pg=PA110 |year=1967 |publisher = Columbia University Press |ISBN =978-0-231-02515-7 |page = 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;|align=right |width=23%}}

Unlike hedonistic utilitarianism, which views pleasure as a moral good, "the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are... order, material wealth, and increase in population".&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{Cite book |title = [[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]] |year = 2011 |last = Loewe |first = Michael |last2 = Shaughnessy |first2 = Edward L. |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] |ISBN = 978-0-52-147030-8 |page = 761}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Mozi's era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. The "material wealth" of Mohist consequentialism refers to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|basic needs]] like shelter and clothing.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy |year = 2011 |last = Van Norden |first = Bryan W. |publisher = [[Hackett Publishing]] |ISBN = 978-1-60-384468-0 |page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanford University|Stanford]] [[sinologist]] [[David S. Nivison|David Shepherd Nivison]], in ''[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]'', writes that the moral goods of Mohism "are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically".&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; In contrast to [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s views, state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic. The importance of outcomes that are good for the [[State (polity)|state]] outweigh the importance of individual pleasure and pain.

===Society===
Mozi posited that, when society functions as an organized organism, the wastes and inefficiencies found in the natural state (without organization) are reduced.  He believed that conflicts are born from the absence of moral uniformity found in human cultures in the natural state, i.e. the absence of the definition of what is right (是 shì) and what is wrong (非 fēi). According to Mozi, we must therefore choose leaders who will surround themselves with righteous followers, who will then create the hierarchy that harmonizes Shi/Fei. In that sense, the government becomes an authoritative and automated tool. Assuming that the leaders in the social hierarchy are perfectly conformed to the ruler, who is perfectly submissive to Heaven, conformity in speech and behaviour is expected of all people. There is no freedom of speech {{definition|date=November 2011}} in this model. However, the potentially repressive element is countered by compulsory communication between the subjects and their leaders. Subjects are required to report all things good or bad to their rulers. Mohism is opposed to any form of aggression, especially [[war]] between states. It is, however, permissible for a state to use force in legitimate defense.

===Meritocratic government===
{{Main article|Meritocracy}}
Mozi believed that the norm of handing out important government responsibilities to [[Nepotism|one's relatives]] regardless of capabilities, as opposed to those who were best equipped to handle these responsibilities, restricted [[social mobility]]. Mozi taught that as long as a person was qualified for a task, he should keep his position, regardless of blood relations. If an officer were incapable, even if he were a close relative of the ruler, he ought to be demoted, even if it meant poverty.

A ruler should be in close proximity to talented people, treasuring talents and seeking their counsel frequently. Without discovering and understanding talents within the country, the country will be destroyed. History unfortunately saw many people who were murdered, not because of their frailties, but rather because of their strengths. A good bow is difficult to pull, but it shoots high. A good horse is difficult to ride, but it can carry weight and travel far. Talented people are difficult to manage, but they can bring respect to their rulers.

Law and order was an important aspect of Mozi's philosophy. He compared the [[carpenter]], who uses standard tools to do his work, with the ruler, who might not have ''any'' standards by which to rule at all. The carpenter is always better off when depending on his standard tools, rather than on his emotions. Ironically, as his decisions affect the fate of an entire nation, it is even more important that a ruler maintains a set of standards, and yet he has none. These standards cannot originate from man, since no man is perfect; the only standards that a ruler uses have to originate from Heaven, since only Heaven is perfect. That law of Heaven is [[Love]].

In a perfect governmental structure where the ruler loves all people benevolently, and officials are selected according to meritocracy, the people should have unity in belief and in speech. His original purpose in this teaching was to unite people and avoid sectarianism. However, in a situation of corruption and tyranny, this teaching might be misused as a tool for oppression.

Should the ruler be unrighteous, seven disasters would result for that nation. These seven disasters are:
# Neglect of the country's defense, yet there is much lavished on the palace.
# When pressured by foreigners, neighbouring countries are not willing to help.
# The people are engaged in unconstructive work while useless fools are rewarded.
# Law and regulations became too heavy such that there is repressive fear and people only look after their own good.
# The ruler lives in a mistaken illusion of his own ability and his country's strength.
# Trusted people are not loyal while loyal people are not trusted.
# Lack of food. Ministers are not able to carry out their work. Punishment fails to bring fear and reward fails to bring happiness.
A country facing these seven disasters will be destroyed easily by the enemy.

The measure of a country's wealth in Mohism is a matter of sufficient provision and a large population. Thriftiness is believed to be key to this end. With contentment with that which suffices, men will be free from excessive labour, long-term war and poverty from income gap disparity. This will enable birth rate to increase. Mozi also encourages early marriage.

===Supernatural forces===
Rulers of the period often ritually assigned punishments and rewards to their subjects in spiritually important places to garner the attention of these spirits and ensure that justice was done. The respect of these spirits was deemed so important that prehistoric Chinese ancestors had left their instructions on bamboo, plates and stones to ensure the continual obedience of their future descendants to the dictates of heaven. In Mozi's teachings, sacrifices of bulls and rams were mentioned during appointed times during the spring and autumn seasons. Spirits were described to be the preexisting primal spirits of nature, or the souls of humans who had died.

The Mohists polemicized against elaborate [[funeral]] ceremonies and other wasteful rituals, and called for austerity in life and in governance, but did not deem spiritual sacrifices wasteful. Using historical records, Mohists argued that the spirits of innocent men wrongfully murdered had appeared before to enact their vengeance. Spirits had also been recorded to have appeared to carry out other acts of justice. Mohists believed in heaven as a divine force (天 ''[[Tian]]''), the celestial bureaucracy and spirits which knew about the immoral acts of man and punished them, encouraging moral [[righteousness]], and were wary of some of the more atheistic thinkers of the time, such as [[Han Fei]]. Due to the vague nature of the records, there is a possibility that the Mohist scribes themselves may not have been clear about this subject.

===Against fatalism===
Mozi disagrees with the [[Fatalism|fatalistic]] mindset of people, accusing the mindset of bringing about poverty and suffering. To argue against this attitude, Mozi used three criteria (''San Biao'') to assess the correctness of views. These were:&lt;ref name=philosophers&gt;''One hundred Philosophers. A guide to the world's greatest thinkers'' Peter J. King, Polish edition: Elipsa 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
#Assessing them based on history
#Assessing them based on the experiences of common, average people
#Assessing their usefulness by applying them in law or politics&lt;ref name=philosophers/&gt;
In summary, fatalism, the belief that all outcomes are predestined or fated to occur, is an irresponsible belief espoused by those who refuse to acknowledge that their own sinfulness has caused the hardships of their lives. Prosperity or poverty are directly correlated with either virtue or sinfulness, respectively; not fate. Mozi calls fatalism a heresy which needs to be destroyed.

===Against ostentation===
By the time of Mozi, Chinese rulers and the wealthier citizens already had the practice of extravagant burial rituals. Much wealth was buried with the dead, and ritualistic mourning could be as extreme as walking on a stick hunchback for three years in a posture of mourning. During such lengthy funerals, people are not able to attend to agriculture or care for their families, leading to poverty. Mozi spoke against such long and lavish funerals and also argued that this would even create resentment among the living.

Mozi views [[Art|aesthetics]] as nearly useless. Unlike Confucius, he holds a distinctive repulsion to any development in ritual [[music]] and the [[fine arts]]. Mozi takes some whole chapters named "Against Music" (非樂) to discuss this. Though he mentions that he does enjoy and recognize what is pleasant, he sees them of no utilization in terms of governing, or of the benefit of common people. Instead, since development of music involves man's power, it reduces production of food; furthermore, appreciation of music results in less time for administrative works. This overdevelopment eventually results in shortage of food, as well as anarchy. This is because manpower will be diverted from agriculture and other fundamental works towards ostentations. Civilians will eventually imitate the ruler's lusts, making the situation worse. Mozi probably advocated this idea in response to the fact that during the Warring States period, the Zhou king and the aristocrats spent countless time in the development of delicate music while ordinary peasants could hardly meet their subsistence needs. To Mozi, bare necessities are sufficient; resources should be directed to benefit man.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==The Logicians==
One of the schools of Mohism that has received some attention is the [[School of Names|Logicians]] school, which was interested in resolving logical puzzles. Not much survives from the writings of this school, since problems of [[logic]] were deemed trivial by most subsequent Chinese philosophers. Historians such as [[Joseph Needham]] have seen this group as developing a precursor [[philosophy of science]] that was never fully developed, but others{{Who|date=February 2012}} believe that recognizing the Logicians as proto-scientists reveals too much of a modern bias.

==Mathematics==
The Mohist canon of the ''Mo Jing'' described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small wealth of information on [[mathematics]] as well. It provided an 'atomic' definition of the geometric point, stating that a line is separated into parts, and the part which has no remaining parts (i.e. cannot be divided into smaller parts) and thus the extreme end of a line is a point.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986}}, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Much like [[Euclid]]'s first and third definitions and [[Plato]]'s 'beginning of a line', the ''Mo Jing'' stated that "a point may stand at the end (of a line) or at its beginning like a head-presentation in childbirth. (As to its invisibility) there is nothing similar to it."&lt;ref name="needham92"&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986}}, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the [[atomist]]s of [[Democritus]], the ''Mo Jing'' stated that a point is the smallest unit, and cannot be cut in half, since 'nothing' cannot be halved.&lt;ref name="needham92" /&gt; It stated that two lines of equal length will always finish at the same place,&lt;ref name="needham92" /&gt; while providing definitions for the ''comparison of lengths'' and for ''parallels'',&lt;ref name="needham93"&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986}}, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; along with principles of space and bounded space.&lt;ref name="needham93" /&gt; It also described the fact that planes without the quality of thickness cannot be piled up since they cannot mutually touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986}}, 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt; The book provided definitions for circumference, diameter, and radius, along with the definition of volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1986}}, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Siege engineers==
One consequence of Mohist understanding of mathematics and the physical sciences, combined with their anti-militarist philosophy and skills as [[artisans]], was that they became the pre-eminent siege-defense engineers during the period prior to the Qin unification of China.  They believed in aiding the defensive warfare of smaller Chinese states against the hostile offensive warfare of larger domineering states.

: Mozi and his disciples worked concertedly and systematically to invent and synthesise measures of benefit to defence, including defensive arms and strategy, and their corresponding logistics and military mobilisation. Many were actually applied, and remained an aspect of military affairs throughout history. The ''Mozi'' is hence highly respected by modern scholars, and ranks as a classic on military matters on a par with Sunzi's ''Art of War,'' the former of defensive strategy, the latter of offensive strategy.[https://academic.oup.com/cjip/article-abstract/2/3/421/540635]

The Mohist beliefs were popular for a time in China, and Mohist followers were employed for their ability as negotiators and as defense engineers. This component of Mohism is dramatized in the story of Gongshu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ctext.org/mozi/gong-shu | title=公輸 - Gong Shu | website=Chinese Text Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in the Mohist canon.  Mozi travels 10 days and nights when he hears that Gongshu Pan has built machines for the king of Chu to use in an invasion of the smaller state of Song.  Upon arriving in Chu, Mozi makes a wall out of his belt and sticks to represent machines, and shows Gongshu Pan that he can defend Song against any offensive strategy Chu might use.  Mozi then announces that three hundred of his disciples are already on the walls of Song, ready to defend against Chu. The king cancels the invasion.

==Decline==
With the [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]] under the Qin, China was no longer divided into various states constantly fighting each other: where previously the Mohists proved to be an asset when defending a city against an external threat, without wars, and in particular siege wars, there was no more need for their skills. The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' suggests, in addition to the decline of siege warfare, "... the major factor is probably that as a social and philosophical movement, Mohism gradually collapsed into irrelevance. By the middle of the former Han dynasty, the more appealing aspects of Mohist thought were all shared with rival schools.

Their core ethical doctrines had largely been absorbed into Confucianism, though in a modified and unsystematic form. Key features of their political philosophy were probably shared with most other political thinkers, and their trademark opposition to warfare had been rendered effectively redundant by unification. The philosophy of language, epistemology, metaphysics, and science of the later Mohist Canons were recorded in difficult, dense texts that would have been nearly unintelligible to most readers (and that in any case quickly became corrupt). What remained as distinctively Mohist was a package of harsh, unappealing economic and cultural views, such as their obsession with parsimony and their rejection of music and ritual. Compared with the classical learning and rituals of the Confucians, the speculative metaphysics of Yin-Yang thinkers, and the romantic nature mysticism and literary sophistication of the Daoists, Mohism offered little to attract adherents, especially politically powerful ones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/|title=Mohism|work=stanford.edu|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern perspectives==
Jin Guantao, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Studies at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], Fan Hongye, a research fellow with the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]' Institute of Science Policy and Managerial Science, and Liu Qingfeng, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, have argued that without the influence of proto-scientific precepts in the ancient philosophy of Mohism, Chinese science lacked a definitive structure:&lt;ref name = "jin fan liu 1996 178 179"&gt;Jin, Fan, &amp; Liu (1996), 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the middle and late Eastern Han to the early Wei and Jin dynasties, the net growth of ancient Chinese science and technology experienced a peak (second only to that of the Northern Song dynasty)...  Han studies of the Confucian classics, which for a long time had hindered the socialization of science, were declining. If Mohism, rich in scientific thought, had rapidly grown and strengthened, the situation might have been very favorable to the development of a scientific structure. However, this did not happen because the seeds of the primitive structure of science were never formed. During the late [[Eastern Han]], disastrous upheavals again occurred in the process of social transformation, leading to [[Three Kingdoms period|the greatest social disorder in Chinese history]]. One can imagine the effect of this calamity on science.&lt;ref name="jin fan liu 1996 178 179"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8609">In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] philology, the '''Old Texts''' ({{zh|c=古文經|p=Gǔwén Jīng|w=Kuwen Ching}}) refer to some versions of the [[Five Classics]] discovered during the [[Han Dynasty]], written in archaic [[Chinese character|character]]s and supposedly produced before the [[To burn the classics and to bury the scholars|burning of the books]], as opposed to the '''Modern Texts''' or '''New Texts''' (今文經) in the new orthography.

The last half of the 2nd century BC was the period when new versions of the Confucian classics were discovered. Most of these new versions were found in the walls of [[Confucius]]’s old residence in [[Qufu]], the old capital of [[State of Lu]], when Prince Liu Yu (d. 127 BC) attempted to expand it into a palace upon taking the throne there. In the course of taking the old wall apart, the restorers found old versions of the ''[[Classic of History]]'', ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'', ''[[Yili (text)|Yili]]'', ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'' and ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', all written in the old orthography used prior to the reforms of the [[Clerical script]]. Hence they were called “old texts”. These newly discovered editions had an effect on later Confucianism.

==Terminology==

: Confucian classics that were reconstructed from surviving copies and scraps.  The ''[[Gongyang Zhuan]]'' and ''[[Guliang Zhuan]]'' commentaries and the ''[[Classic of Rites]]'' are called New Texts.

: These alternate versions of the classics were found after the New Texts were compiled.  Some came from the Confucian family manor while others were found in the imperial archives or in private collections.  The ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'' and the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' commentary are Old Texts.
; Forged Old Texts
: This only concerns the rediscovered version of ''[[Classic of History]]''.  During the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)]], [[Mei Ze]], a minor official discovered a preface by [[Kong Anguo]] and 25 chapters that he claimed were the Old Texts. Suspicions emerged during the [[Song dynasty]] but it was not proven until [[Yan Ruoju]] circulated his thesis in the [[Qing dynasty]].  Recent archaeological recoveries of ancient classics have backed Yan.  [[Huangfu Mi]], [[Wang Su]], or Mei Ze himself is suspected as the forger.
; Received Texts
: The version that has been transmitted to the present.  It includes the Old Text version of ''[[I Ching|Changes]]'' and ''[[Classic of Poetry|Poetry]]'', the New Text version of the ''Yili'', a combined version of the ''Analects'', and the New Text version of ''History'' with the 25 forged chapters.

==Controversy among new schools==
By the time of 1st century, a new controversy had begun between these two texts. The "new texts" are those that had been transliterated into the new orthography back in the beginning of 2nd century BC, either from oral transmissions or from texts that had survived the Qin Dynasty’s burning of the books or were rescued by the Han Dynasty in the provinces. Surviving scholars in the direct line of transmission of these books got hold of surviving copies and transliterated them into the new orthography.

The "old texts" were the ones that off and on since the late 2nd and during the 1st century BC had turned up, some discovered in the walls of Confucius’s residence, or in Warring States period graves. They were called the “old texts” because they were written in the pre-Qin writing. The discoverers of the "old texts", such as [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]], claimed that all existing texts suffered from an interrupted pedigree, which was rectified by the newly discovered texts.  "New text" followers claim the "old texts" are forgeries that lack a line of transmission.

In reality, the burning of the books probably did little more than symbolically burn a few copies of the Confucian books conveniently at hand in the capital.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Many other copies survived elsewhere, and these were available for copying into the new orthographic standard set by Qin and its [[clerical script]] successor which evolved under Han Dynasty. It was the change in orthography which divided the [[Warring States]] and early imperial period textual traditions, and in this respect the newly discovered texts were no different from those used as the basis for the "new text" transcriptions soon after the fall of [[Qin Dynasty]].

The "new texts" portray Confucius as a prophet or "uncrowned king" that should have received the [[Mandate of Heaven]].  He could perform miracles and wrote the Five Classics himself.  The New Text school, founded by [[Dong Zhongshu]], believed the texts were sacred and carried hidden clues to the future that they tried to decode.  They were also interested in apocryphal writings that were obtuse and esoteric.  They believed historical events were caused by cosmic forces beyond the control of man.  They also believed officials should disobey the sovereign's decree if it will harm the state or dynasty.  To betray the sovereign for the sovereign's own sake will keep the Mandate of Heaven in the dynasty's hand and is an act of greater loyalty.

The Old Text school was rationalistic.  They rejected apocrypha and believed that the classics were only edited by Confucius.  They believed history was caused by human actions and viewed the Son of Heaven (the [[emperor of China]]) as the [[axis mundi]] whose will was [[Absolute monarchy|absolute]].  Officials may advise but not disobey as it is the emperor who is ultimately responsible for keeping or losing the Mandate of Heaven.

The “old texts” had a peculiarly archaist bent. They emphasized the sage-like as opposed to the prophet-like characteristics of Confucius, thereby making him look more like the earlier sages who founded and ruled [[Zhou Dynasty]] or even the still more archaic states which preceded it. And yet, these archaic sage-kings are shown ruling China with a bureaucratic apparatus peculiarly like that available to Han Dynasty rulers, and hence by methods which strikingly echoed those of putative enemies of [[Wang Mang]], the modernists. The Former Han (206 BC-AD 8), prior to Wang Mang, had favored New Text.  When Wang seized power, he declared the Old Texts to be the state orthodoxy. After the Han restoration, the New Texts became orthodox again.

Later Han (AD 25-220) scholars began favoring the Old Text versions. Old Texter [[Zheng Xuan]] synthesized the teachings of both schools.  While he was very influential, he was unable to unseat the New Text orthodoxy though the issue became moot when both schools disappeared after the collapse of the Han.  Zheng became the mainstream source of interpretation until the appearance of [[Neo-Confucianism]] in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]]. The controversy was forgotten until it was rediscovered during the [[Qing]] dynasty by [[Han Learning]] scholars.

== Modern interpretations ==
Significance of the old/new text controversy is a debate topic in the modern sinology. Martin Kern claims that the issue itself was an artificial projection of the mid-Han problematic onto the early Han realities. According to him, the issue should be seen in light of the transition from the self-referential ritual tradition (centered on the oral and multimedia practices) to the literary canon.&lt;ref&gt;http://chin.nju.edu.cn/zwx/wxs/czc/sinology2007206.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425130742/http://chin.nju.edu.cn/zwx/wxs/czc/sinology2007206.pdf |date=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Thomas Geach''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|iː|tʃ}}; 1916–2013) was a British philosopher and professor of [[logic]] at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/12/in-memoriam-peter-geach-1917-2013.html |title=Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog: In Memoriam: Peter Geach (1916-2013) |publisher=Leiterreports.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His areas of interest were the [[history of philosophy]], [[philosophical logic]], [[ethics]], philosophy of religion, and the theory of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]].

==Early life==

Peter Geach was born in London on 29 March 1916 to George Hender Geach, a professor of philosophy in Lahore who had studied philosophy at Cambridge, in the days of Russell, Moore, and Mactaggart, and [[E. F. A. Geach|Eleonora Adolfina Sgonina]], a poet, and spent his earliest years in [[Cardiff]]. He attended [[The Cathedral School, Llandaff|Llandaff Cathedral School]] and [[Clifton College]].&lt;ref&gt;"Clifton College Register" Muirhead, J.A.O. p448: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; He received instruction in logic and philosophy from his father who, as a member of the Indian Educational Service, had been professor of philosophy at Lahore and later principal of a teacher training college in Peshawar. His parents' marriage was unhappy and quickly broke up. Until around the age of four, he lived with his maternal grandparents in Cardiff, after which time he was raised by a guardian, and then sent first to Llandaff Cathedral School and then to Clifton College. Geach never saw his mother again after childhood.

In 1934 Geach won a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], graduating in 1938 with a First in Literae Humaniores.

==Academic career==

Geach spent a year (1938–39) as a Gladstone Research Student, based at [[Gladstone's Library|St Deiniol's Library]], Hawarden. Following the end of World War II in 1945, he undertook further research at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

In 1951, Geach was appointed to his first substantive academic post, as assistant lecturer at the [[University of Birmingham]], going on to become [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Logic. In 1966 he was appointed Professor of Logic in the Department of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref name=anscombe/&gt; Geach retired from his chair in 1981 with the title [[Emeritus]] Professor of Logic.&lt;ref name="leeds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/calendar/emeritus.htm|website=leeds.ac.uk|title=University of Leeds, List of Emeritus Professors|accessdate=11 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926134723/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/calendar/emeritus.htm|archivedate=26 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also held [[Visiting scholar|Visiting Professorships]] at the universities of [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] and [[University of Warsaw|Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="leeds2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leeds.ac.uk/secretariat/obituaries/2014/geach_peter.html|title=Obituaries &amp;#124; Secretariat|website=University of Leeds|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geach was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] (FBA) in 1965.&lt;ref name="britac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/ord.cfm|website=britac.ac.uk|title=British Academy, List of Fellows|accessdate=11 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013161618/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/ord.cfm|archivedate=13 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected an [[Honorary Fellow]] of Balliol College in 1979.

He was awarded the papal cross "[[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]]" by the [[Holy See]] for his philosophical work.

==Thought==
His early work includes the classic texts ''Mental Acts'' and ''Reference and Generality'', the latter defending an essentially modern conception of [[reference]] against medieval theories of supposition. His Catholic perspective was integral to his philosophy. He was perhaps the founder of [[Analytical Thomism]] (though the current of thought running through his and [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe's]] work to the present day was only ostensibly so named forty years later by [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]]), the aim of which is to synthesise Thomistic and Analytic approaches. Geach was a student and an early follower of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] whilst at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;News item 'Peter Geach' in [http://philosophynow.org/issues/100/News_January_February_2014 Philosophy Now, Issue 100 (link)], accessed 29 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geach defends the Thomistic position that human beings are essentially [[rationalism|rational]] animals, each one miraculously created. He dismissed Darwinistic attempts to regard reason as inessential to humanity, as "mere sophistry, laughable, or pitiable." He repudiated any capacity for [[Animal language|language in animals]] as mere "association of manual signs with things or performances." {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Geach dismissed both pragmatic and epistemic conceptions of truth, commending a version of the [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence theory]] proposed by [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]. He argues that there is one reality rooted in God himself, who is the ultimate truthmaker. God, according to Geach, ''is'' truth. While they lived, he saw [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] and [[Arthur Prior]] as his allies, in that they held three truths: that there are no non-existent beings; that a proposition can occur in discourse without being there asserted; and that the sense of a term does not depend on the truth of the proposition in which it occurs. He invented the famous ethical example of the stuck potholer, when arguing against the idea that it might be right to kill a child to save its mother. Jenny Teichman, fellow of [[New Hall, Cambridge]], has characterised Geach's philosophical style as "deliberately outrageous".&lt;ref name=teichman/&gt;

==Personal life==
His wife and occasional collaborator was the philosopher and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] scholar [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]].&lt;ref name=anscombe/&gt; Both converts to Roman Catholicism, they married in 1941 and had seven children.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; They co-authored the 1961 book ''Three Philosophers'', with Anscombe contributing a section on [[Aristotle]] and Geach one each on Aquinas and [[Gottlob Frege]].&lt;ref name=anscombe/&gt; For a quarter century they were leading figures in the [[Philosophical Enquiry Group]], an annual confluence of Catholic philosophers held at [[Spode House]] in Staffordshire that was established by Father [[Columba Ryan]] in 1954.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Peter Geach died early in the morning on 21 December 2013 at [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]] in Cambridge and is buried in what is now the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51340">{{C. S. Peirce articles}}
"'''Pragmaticism'''" is a term used by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] for his pragmatic philosophy starting in 1905, in order [[stipulative definition|to distance himself and it]] from [[pragmatism]], the original name, which had been used in a manner he did not approve of in the "literary journals". Peirce in 1905 announced his coinage "pragmaticism", saying that it was "ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers" (''Collected Papers'' (CP) 5.414). Today, outside of philosophy, "pragmatism" is often taken to refer to a compromise of aims or principles, even a ruthless search for mercenary advantage. Peirce gave other or more specific reasons for the distinction in a surviving draft letter that year and in later writings. Peirce's pragmatism, that is, pragmaticism, differed in Peirce's view from other pragmatisms by its commitments to the spirit of strict logic, the immutability of truth, the reality of infinity, and the difference between (1) actively willing to control thought, to doubt, to weigh reasons, and (2) willing not to exert the will, willing to believe.&lt;ref name=NA&gt;Peirce (1908), "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, CP 6.452-485, EP 2:434-450, and elsewhere. See the discussion of pragmatism toward the end. Depending on the edition, it may appear in Section V or in an "additament" afterward.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view his pragmatism is, strictly speaking, not itself a whole philosophy, but instead a general method for the clarification of ideas. He first publicly formulated his pragmatism as an aspect of scientific logic along with [[Founders of statistics|principles of statistics]] and modes of inference in his "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" series of articles in 1877-8.

==Pragmatic maxim==

Whether one chooses to call it "[[pragmatism]]" or "pragmaticism"—and Peirce himself was not always consistent about it even after the notorious renaming—his conception of pragmatic philosophy is based on one or another version of the so-called "[[pragmatic maxim]]".  Here is one of his more emphatic statements of it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pragmaticism was originally enounced in the form of a maxim, as follows:  Consider what effects, that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings, you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have.  Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object (CP 5.438).&lt;ref&gt;See p. 481 in Peirce, C.&amp;nbsp;S. (1905), "Issues of Pragmaticism", The ''Monist'', vol. 15, pp. 481-499, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA481-IA20 Eprint], ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/details/monistquart15hegeuoft Eprint]. Reprinted ''Collected Papers'' (CP) v. 5, paragraphs 438-463, see 438, and in ''Charles S. Peirce: Selected Writings'', pp. 203-226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1909 ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'', the entry for pragmaticism, written, it now appears, by John Dewey,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce had primary responsibility in the ''Century Dictionary'' for terms in logic, philosophy and other fields, see B:139. "Pragmatism" and presumably "pragmaticism" were among the words in Peirce's charge in the ''Century Dictionary'' - see under "[http://www.pep.uqam.ca/listsofwords.pep?l=P P] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002082422/http://www.pep.uqam.ca/listsofwords.pep?l=P |date=2011-10-02 }}" in the list of words at [http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep PEP-UQÀM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211228/http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep |date=2011-07-06 }}, the Peirce Edition Project's branch at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM), which is working on [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings]] v. 7: Peirce's work on the ''Century Dictionary''. However, [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph M. Ransdell]] reported that PEP-UQÀM's director François Latraverse informed him that [[John Dewey]] actually wrote the ''Supplement''s definitions of "pragmatic", "pragmatism", etc. See [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.philosophy.peirce/6 Ransdell's 2006 January 13 post] to peirce-l.&lt;/ref&gt; was

==Pragmatism's origin==

Pragmatism as a philosophical movement originated in 1872 in discussions in [[The Metaphysical Club]] among Peirce, [[William James]], [[Chauncey Wright]], [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]], [[Francis Ellingwood Abbot]], [[Nicholas St. John Green]], and [[Joseph Bangs Warner]].  The first use in print of the name ''pragmatism'' appears to have been in 1898 by James, who credited Peirce with having coined the name during the early 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;As Brent (B:86) points out, in a letter November 10, 1900 (CP 8:253) to James, Peirce wrote:{{quote|Now, however, I have a particular occasion to write. Baldwin, arrived at J in his dictionary, suddenly calls on me to do the rest of the logic, in the utmost haste, and various questions of terminology come up. &lt;br&gt;Who originated the term ''pragmatism'', I or you? Where did it first appear in print? What do you understand by it?}}
to which James replied (CP 8:253 footnote 8) on a post card dated November 26, 1900, Widener Library (Cambridge, Massachusetts) VB2a:{{quote|You invented 'pragmatism' for which I gave you full credit in a lecture entitled 'Philosophical conceptions and practical results' of which I sent you 2 (unacknowledged) copies a couple of years ago.}}
As Brent also points out (B:88), Peirce — or as Peirce scholars recently say, Dewey ([[#Dewey|see above]]) — in the 1909 ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'' [[s:The Century Dictionary/Volume 12/P|definition of pragmatism]] (''Wikisource''), wrote: {{quote|In an article for "The Monist" for 1905, Mr. Peirce says that he "has used it continually in philosophical conversation since, perhaps, the mid-seventies." The term was publicly introduced in print by Professor William James in 1898 in an address upon "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Realities," in which authorship of the term and of the method is credited to Mr. Peirce.}}
James, William (1898), "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results", delivered before the Philosophical Union of the University of California at Berkeley, August 26, 1898, and first printed in the ''University Chronicle'' 1, September 1898, pp. 287-310. ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalcon00jameuoft#page/n4/mode/1up Eprint]. On [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalcon00jameuoft#page/290/mode/1up p. 290]:: {{quote|I refer to Mr. Charles S. Peirce, with whose very existence as a philosopher I dare say many of you are unacquainted. He is one of the most original of contemporary thinkers; and the principle of practicalism or pragmatism, as he called it, when I first heard him enunciate it at Cambridge in the early 70s is the clue or compass by following which I find myself more and more confirmed in believing we may keep our feet upon the proper trail.}}
James credited Peirce again the 1901-1902 Gifford Lectures that were published as ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' (p. 444), and then in the 1906 lectures that were published in 1907 as ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', see Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

James, among others, regarded Peirce's 1877-8 "Illustrations of the Logic of Science" series, especially "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) as [[pragmatism]]'s foundation.&lt;ref&gt;See James (1897), ''Will to Believe'' (which James dedicated to Peirce), see p. 124 and footnote via ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=wRMXL4uYEegC&amp;pg=PA124 Eprint]: {{quote|Indeed, it may be said that if two apparently different definitions of the reality before us should have identical consequences, those two definitions would really be identical definitions, made delusively to appear different merely by the different verbiage in which they are expressed.¹&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;¹ See the admirably original "Illustrations of the Logic of Science," by C. S. Peirce, especially the second paper, "How to make our Thoughts clear," {{sic}} in the Popular Science Monthly for January, 1878.}} See also James's 1907 ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce (CP 5.11-12), like James&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1907) ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method of thinking and resolving dilemmas. Peirce differed from James and the early [[John Dewey]], in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.

In a 1906 manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., "The Founding of Pragmatism", manuscript written 1906, published in ''The Hound &amp; Horn: A Harvard Miscellany'' v. II, n. 3, April–June 1929, pp. 282–5, see 283–4, reprinted 1934 as "Historical Affinities and Genesis" in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, paragraphs 11–13, see 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce wrote that, in the Metaphysical Club decades earlier, Nicholas St. John Green&lt;blockquote&gt;often urged the importance of applying [[Alexander Bain|Bain]]'s definition of belief, as "that upon which a man is prepared to act." From this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism.&lt;/blockquote&gt; James and Peirce, inspired by crucial links among belief, conduct, and [[disposition]], agreed with Green. [[John Shook]] has said, "Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a phenomenalist and [[Fallibilism|fallibilist]] [[empiricism]] as a vital alternative to rationalistic speculation."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Shook|Shook, John]] (undated), "The Metaphysical Club", the ''Pragmatism Cybrary''. [http://www.pragmatism.org/research/metaphysical_club.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatism is regarded as a distinctively [[United States|American]] philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} As advocated by James, [[John Dewey]], [[F. C. S. Schiller]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and others, it has proved durable and popular. But Peirce did not seize on this fact to enhance his reputation, and even coined the word "pragmaticism" to distinguish his philosophical position.

==Clarification of ideas in inquiry==

Pragmatism starts with the idea that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is about conceptions of objects. His pragmatism is a method for fruitfully sorting out conceptual confusions caused, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needful) formal yet not practical differences. It equates any conception of an object with a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of those conceived effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. Those conceivable practical implications are the conception's meaning. The meaning is the consequent form of conduct or practice that would be implied by accepting the conception as true. Peirce's pragmaticism, in the strict sense, is about the conceptual elucidation of conceptions into such meanings — about how to make our ideas clear. Making them true, in the sense of proving and bearing them out in fruitful practice, goes beyond that. A conception's truth is its correspondence to the real, to that which would be found by investigation taken far enough. A conception's actual confirmation (if it occurs) is neither its meaning nor its truth ''per se'', but an actual upshot.

In "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]",&lt;ref&gt;See also "The Logic of Relatives," The ''Monist'', Vol. 7, 1897, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA161 161]-217 (via ''Google Books''). Reprinted in CP, v. 3, paragraphs 456-552.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce discusses three grades of clearness of conception: &lt;br&gt;
:1. Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.
:2. Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its definition's parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea ''distinct'', that is, clarified by analysis of just what elements make the given idea applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce calls such a definition "nominal" (CP 5.553).
:3. Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's effects as conceived of, such as can lead to fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduces that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]].

By way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Presuppositions of logic|presuppositions of reasoning]] in general. To reason is to presuppose (and at least to hope), as a principle of the reasoner's self-regulation, that the truth is independent of our vagaries of opinion and is discoverable. In clearness's second grade (the "nominal" grade), he defines truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object, and the real as the object (be it a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law) to which a true sign corresponds, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite [[Community of inquiry|community of inquirers]] think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defines truth — not as actual consensus, such that to inquire would be to poll the experts — but as that which ''would'' be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.&lt;ref name=Induction&gt;"That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead", in Peirce, C.&amp;nbsp;S. (1878 April), "The Probability of Induction", p. 718 (''Internet Archive'' ''[https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up Eprint]) ''in ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 705-18. Reprinted (''Chance, Love, and Logic'', pp. 82-105), (CP 2.669-93), (''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'', pp. 174-89), (W 3:290-305), (EP 1:155-69).&lt;/ref&gt; (Peirce held that one cannot have absolute theoretical assurance of having actually reached the truth, and later said that the confession of inaccuracy and one-sidedness is an essential ingredient of a true abstract statement.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1902), "''Logical''" in "Truth and Falsity and Error", ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'' v. 2, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Truth%20is%20that%20concordance%22 p. 718]. Reprinted CP v. 5, paragraphs 565-566.&lt;/ref&gt;) Peirce argues that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability. For more on Peirce's theory of truth, see the Peirce section in [[Pragmatic theory of truth#Peirce|Pragmatic theory of truth]]. Peirce's discussions and definitions of truth have influenced several epistemic truth theorists and been used as foil for [[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]] and [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] theories of truth.

Peirce said that a conception's meaning consists in "[[Pragmatic maxim#2|all general modes of rational conduct]]" implied by "acceptance" of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism, since a conception is general, does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth, nor does it equate its meaning, much less its truth (if it is true), with the conceived or actual benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true in what it purports. If it is true, its truth is not transitory but instead immutable and independent of actual trends of opinion. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to "vulgar" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and [[Machiavelli]]an search for mercenary or political advantage. Rather, Peirce's pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental [[Pragmatic maxim#6|reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), CP 5.13 note 1&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification&lt;ref&gt;See CP 1.34 [http://www.textlog.de/4220.html Eprint] (in "The Spirit of Scholasticism"), where Peirce attributes the success of modern science not so much to a novel interest in verification as to the improvement of verification.&lt;/ref&gt; to test the truth of putative knowledge.

Peirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of ''definitions and the clearness of ideas'', is a department within his theory of inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.cspeirce.com/homepage/ransdell.htm Joseph Ransdell]'s comments and his tabular list of titles of Peirce's proposed list of memoirs in 1902 for his Carnegie application, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/intro/l75intro.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; which he variously called "Methodeutic" and "Philosophical or Speculative Rhetoric". He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.

Peirce called his pragmatism "the logic of [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1903), "Pragmatism — The Logic of Abduction", CP v. 5, paragraphs 195-205, especially paragraph 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the logic of inference to explanatory hypotheses. As a method conducive to hypotheses as well as predictions and testing, pragmatism leads beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives, namely:

:* [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] from self-evident truths, or ''[[rationalism]]'';

:* [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] from experiential phenomena, or ''[[empiricism]]''.

His approach is distinct from [[foundationalism]], empiricist or otherwise, as well as from [[coherentism]], by the following three dimensions:

:* Active process of theory generation, with no prior assurance of truth;

:* Subsequent application of the contingent theory in order to clarify its logical and practical implications;

:* Testing and evaluation of the provisional theory's utility for the ''[[anticipation]]'' of future experience, and that in dual senses of the word: ''[[prediction]]'' and ''control''. Peirce's appreciation of these three dimensions serves to flesh out a [[physiognomy]] of inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization ''simpliciter'', which is merely the relabeling of phenomenological patterns.  Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the [[scientific method]] was proposed as an [[epistemology]] for philosophical questions.

A theory that proves itself more successful than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth employed by scientists.

In "[http://www.peirce.org/writings/p107.html The Fixation of Belief]", Peirce characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to settle disturbances or conflicts of belief, irritating, inhibitory doubts, belief being that on which one is willing to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry not only as a special kind of inquiry in a broader spectrum, but also, like inquiry generally, as based on actual doubts, not mere verbal doubts (such as [[hyperbolic doubt]]), which he held to be fruitless, and it let him also frame it, by the same stroke, as requiring that proof rest on propositions free from actual doubt, rather than on ultimate and absolutely indubitable propositions. He outlined four methods, ordered from least to most successful in achieving a secure fixation of belief:
# The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) — which brings comforts and decisiveness, but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views, as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well fail to avoid noticing when another's opinion is as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.
# The method of authority — which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to suppress doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.
# The method of the ''a priori'' — which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of "what is agreeable to reason." Thereby it depends on fashion in paradigms and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The method of science — the only one whereby inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong ([[fallibilism]]), and purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", 1898, Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published CP 1.616-48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., comm.), 105-22, reprinted in EP 2:27-41.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn should not be bound to the other methods and to practical ends; reason's "first rule" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1899), "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], CP v. 1, paragraphs 135-40. [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; What recommends the scientific method of inquiry above all others is that it is deliberately designed to arrive, eventually, at the ultimately most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can eventually be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce shows how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.

==Pragmaticism's name==

[[Image:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William James]]&lt;br&gt;1842–1910]] [[Image:FCSSchiller Slosson1917.jpg|thumb|upright|[[F. C. S. Schiller]]&lt;br&gt;1863–1937]]  It is sometimes stated that James' and other philosophers' use of the word ''pragmatism'' so dismayed Peirce that he renamed his own variant ''pragmaticism''. [[Susan Haack]] has disagreed,&lt;ref&gt;1998, ''Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate'', Chicago IL: University of Chicago Press, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out the context in which Peirce publicly introduced the latter term in 1905. Haack's excerpt of Peirce begins below at the words "But at present...," and continues with some ellipses. The fuller excerpt below supports her case further:
{{quote|[The] word "pragmatism" has gained general recognition in a generalised sense that seems to argue power of growth and vitality. The famed psychologist, [[William James|James]], first took it up, seeing that his "radical empiricism" substantially answered to the writer's definition of pragmatism, albeit with a certain difference in the point of view. Next, the admirably clear and brilliant thinker, Mr. [[F. C. S. Schiller|Ferdinand C. S. Schiller]], casting about for a more attractive name for the "anthropomorphism" of his ''Riddle of the Sphinx'', lit, in that most remarkable paper of his on ''Axioms as Postulates'', upon the same designation "pragmatism," which in its original sense was in generic agreement with his own doctrine, for which he has since found the more appropriate specification "humanism," while he still retains "pragmatism" in a somewhat wider sense. So far all went happily. But at present, the word begins to be met with occasionally in the literary journals, where it gets abused in the merciless way that words have to expect when they fall into literary clutches. Sometimes the manners of the British have effloresced in scolding at the word as ill-chosen, —ill-chosen, that is, to express some meaning that it was rather designed to exclude. So then, the writer, finding his bantling "pragmatism" so promoted, feels that it is time to kiss his child good-by and relinquish it to its higher destiny; while to serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition, he begs to announce the birth of the word "pragmaticism", which is ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, on p [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 p. 165]-166 in "What Pragmatism Is", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 2, April 1905, pp. 161-81, reprinted CP 5.411-37, see 5.414.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Then, in a surviving draft letter to Calderoni, dated by the CP editors as ''circa'' that same year 1905, Peirce said regarding his above-quoted discussion:
{{quote|In the April number of the ''Monist'' I proposed that the word 'pragmatism' should hereafter be used somewhat loosely to signify affiliation with [[F. C. S. Schiller|Schiller]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]], [[Josiah Royce|Royce]], and the rest of us, while the particular doctrine which I invented the word to denote, which is your first kind of pragmatism, should be called 'pragmaticism.' The extra syllable will indicate the narrower meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Signor Calderoni (c. 1905), CP 8.205. See under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/pragmaticism.html Pragmaticism] in the CDPT.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Indeed in the ''Monist'' article Peirce had said that the coinage "pragmaticism" was intended "to serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition". Of course this does not mean that Peirce regarded his fellow pragmatist philosophers as word-kidnappers. To the contrary he had said, regarding James's and Schiller's uses of the word "pragmatism": "So far, all went happily." So it would seem that Peirce intended the coinage "pragmaticism" for two distinguishable purposes: (1) protection from literary journals and word-kidnappers, and (2) reference strictly to his own form of pragmatism, as opposed even to other pragmatisms that had not moved him to the new name. In the letter to Calderoni, Peirce did not reject all significant affiliation with fellow pragmatists, and instead said "the rest of us". Nor did he reject all such affiliation in later discussions.

However, in the following year 1906, in a manuscript "A Sketch of Logical Critics",&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 451-62, see pp. 457-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce wrote:
{{quote|I have always fathered my pragmati&lt;/em&gt;ci&lt;/em&gt;sm (as I have called it since James and Schiller made the word [pragmatism] imply "the will to believe," the mutability of truth, the soundness of Zeno's refutation of motion, and pluralism generally), upon Kant, Berkeley, and Leibniz....}}
(Peirce proceeded to criticize J.&amp;nbsp;S. Mill but acknowledged probable aid from Mill's ''Examination''.)

Then, in 1908, in his article "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]",&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; mentioning both James and the journalist, pragmatist, and literary author [[Giovanni Papini]], Peirce wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1871, in a Metaphysical Club in Cambridge, Mass., I used to preach this principle as a sort of logical gospel, representing the unformulated method followed by Berkeley, and in conversation about it I called it "Pragmatism." In December 1877 and January 1878 I set forth the doctrine in the ''Popular Science Monthly'', and the two parts&lt;ref&gt;Peirce refers to "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" and "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]".&lt;/ref&gt; of my essay were printed in French in the ''Revue Philosophique'', volumes vi. and vii. Of course, the doctrine attracted no particular attention, for, as I had remarked in my opening sentence, very few people care for logic. But in 1897 Professor James remodelled the matter, and transmogrified it into a doctrine of philosophy, some parts of which I highly approved, while other and more prominent parts I regarded, and still regard, as opposed to sound logic. About the time Professor Papini discovered, to the delight of the Pragmatist school, that this doctrine was incapable of definition,&lt;ref&gt;See for example "What Pragmatism Is Like", a translation published in October 1907 in ''Popular Science Monthly'' v. 71, pp. 351–8. ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=DKkWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA351 Eprint]. The original Italian: "Introduzione al pragmatismo", ''Leonardo'' series 3, ''anno'' 5, n. 1, February 1907, pp. 26-37, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=DublAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA26 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; which would certainly seem to distinguish it from every other doctrine in whatever branch of science, I was coming to the conclusion that my poor little maxim should be called by another name; and accordingly, in April 1905, I renamed it ''Pragmaticism''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peirce proceeded in "A Neglected Argument" to express both deep satisfaction and deep dismay with his fellow pragmatists. He singled [[F. C. S. Schiller]] out by name and was vague about which among the others he most particularly referred to. Peirce wrote "It seems to me a pity they should allow a philosophy so instinct with life to become infected with seeds of death...."

| vAlign=top | Peirce remained allied with them about:
* the reality of generals and habits, to be understood, as are [[hypostatic abstraction]]s, in terms of potential concrete effects even if unactualized;
* the falsity of necessitarianism;
* the character of consciousness as only "visceral or other external sensation".

* their view that "truth is mutable";
* their view that infinity is unreal; and
* "such confusions of thought as of active willing (willing to control thought, to doubt, and to weigh reasons) with willing not to exert the will (willing to believe)".
|}
There has been some controversy over Peirce's relation to other pragmatists over the years and over the question of what is owed to Peirce, with visible crests in titles such as literary essayist [[Edward Dahlberg]]'s "Cutpurse Philosopher"&lt;ref&gt;In ''Alms for Oblivion'', University of Minnesota Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; about James, in which Dahlberg claimed that Peirce had "tombstone reticences" about making accusations, and Kenneth Laine Ketner's and [[Walker Percy]]'s ''A Thief of Peirce'',&lt;ref&gt;University Press of Mississippi, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Percy described himself as "a thief of Peirce" (page 130). Meanwhile, Schiller, James's wife Alice, and James's son Henry James III believed that James had a habit of overstating his intellectual debts to others such as Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Gerald E., ''William James: His Life and Thought'', Yale University Press, 2001. See pp. 491-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another manuscript "A Sketch of Logical Critic" dated by the CP editors as 1911,&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt of it appears as "Achilles and the Tortoise" in CP 6.177-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce discussed one of [[Zeno's paradoxes]], that of Achilles and the Tortoise, in terms of James's and others' difficulties with it. Peirce therein expressed regret at having used a "contemptuous" manner about such difficulties in his 1903 Harvard lectures on pragmatism (which James had arranged), and said of James, who had died in August 1910: "Nobody has a better right to testify to the morality of his attitude toward his own thoughts than I, who knew and loved him for forty-nine or fifty years. But owing to his almost unexampled incapacity for mathematical thought, combined with intense hatred for logic — probably for its pedantry, its insistence on minute exactitude — the ''gêne'' of its barbarous formulations, etc. rendered him an easy victim to Zeno and the Achilles....",&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.182.&lt;/ref&gt; called James "about as perfect a lover of truth as it is possible for a man to be...."&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.183.&lt;/ref&gt; and said: "In speaking, then, of William James as I do, I am saying the most that I could of any man's intellectual morality; and with him this was but one of a whole diadem of virtues."&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4820">'''Respect for persons''' is the concept that all people deserve the right to fully exercise their [[autonomy]]. Showing respect for persons is a system for interaction in which one entity ensures that another has [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] to be able to make a [[choice]].

This concept is usually discussed in the context of [[research ethics]]. It is one of the three basic principles of research ethics stated in the [[Belmont Report]] issued by the Office of Human Subject Research; it comprises two essential moral requirements: to recognize the right for autonomy and to protect individuals who are disadvantaged to the extent that they cannot practice this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research |location=[[Washington, DC]] |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |url=http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html#gob1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426013513/http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An autonomous person is defined as an individual who is capable of self-legislation and is able to make judgments and actions based on his/her particular set of values, preferences, and beliefs. Respecting a person’s autonomy thus involves considering his/her choices and decisions without deliberate obstruction. It also requires that subjects be treated in a non-degrading manner out of respect for their dignity. In practice, respect for persons is operationalized by obtaining [[Informed Consent]] from all individuals who are going to be research subjects.

==Vulnerable populations==
The standard case for applying respect for persons is when the person receiving the health intervention is of sound mind, fit to make personal decisions, and empowered to choose from various options. Other cases involve showing respect to people who for whatever reason are not free to choose among the typical range of options when making a decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = D. | last2 = Moore-Cox | first2 = A. | last3 = Xavier | first3 = D. | last4 = Lauzier | first4 = F. | last5 = Roberts | first5 = I. | title = Randomized Trials in Vulnerable Populations | doi = 10.1177/1740774507087552 | journal = Clinical Trials | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–69 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18283082| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Robert J.|title=Ethics and regulation of clinical research|year=1988|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=978-0-300-04288-7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medical research ethics, the term Vulnerable Populations generally refers to individuals whose situations do not allow them to protect their own interests. The categories of individuals that constitute Vulnerable Populations are outlined under The Common Rule (45 CFR 46, Subparts A-D). These include individuals who are minors, prisoners, pregnant, physically handicapped, mentally disabled, old, economically disadvantaged, educationally disadvantaged, or subordinates in hierarchical groups (e.g. a soldier).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruof|first=Mary, C.|title=Vulnerability, Vulnerable Populations, and Policy.|journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal|year=2004|volume=4|issue=14|pages=411–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2. International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, Council for International Organization of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and World Health Organization (WHO) Geneva, Switzerland, 2002|url=http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823205120/http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf|archivedate=2010-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These individuals are entitled to protection, and additional ethical justification is needed to involve such populations in human subject studies. In such cases, a balance should be established between protecting subjects from exploitation and depriving these subjects of access to the potential benefits of research.

Reasons justifying the participation of these subjects would include that some studies could not be carried out without a vulnerable population. Another justification would be that the aim of the study is to gain knowledge to improve diagnosis, prevention or treatment of diseases associated specifically with that population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruof|first=Mary, C.|title=Vulnerability, Vulnerable Populations, and Policy.|journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal|year=2004|volume=4|issue=14|pages=411–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Arthur Wollheim''' (5 May 1923 – 4 November 2003) was a British philosopher noted for original work on [[philosophy of mind|mind]] and [[emotion]]s, especially as related to the [[visual art]]s, specifically, painting.  Wollheim served as the president of the [[British Society of Aesthetics]] from 1992 onwards until his death in 2003.

==Biography==
Son of an actress and a theatre impresario, Wollheim attended [[Westminster School]], London, and [[Balliol College, Oxford]] (1941–2, 1945–8), interrupted by active military service in World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref&gt;For his own account of his service in Europe during the war, see Wollheim, "Fifty Years On", ''London Review of Books'' 23 (23 Je 1994): 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 he obtained a [[congratulatory first]] in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, and began teaching at [[University College London]], where he became [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote Professor of Mind and Logic]] and Department Head from 1963 to 1982. He retired from that position to take up professorships, first, at [[Columbia University]] (1982–85) and then the [[University of California at Berkeley]] (1985–2002). He chaired the Department at UC Berkeley, 1998–2002. On retirement from Berkeley, he served briefly as a guest lecturer at [[Balliol College]]. Additionally, he held visiting positions at [[Harvard University]],the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Graduate Center, CUNY]], the [[University of California at Davis]], and elsewhere. Wollheim gave several distinguished lecture series, most notably the Andrew M. Mellon lectures in Fine Arts, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (1984), published as ''Painting as an Art''.

In 1962, he published an article "A paradox in the theory of democracy",&lt;ref&gt;In "Philosophy, Politics and Society", edited by Peter Laslett and W.G. Runciman, published by Basil Blackwell, 1962. Pp. 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Wollheim argued that a supporter of democracy faces a contradiction when he votes. On the one hand he wants a particular party or candidate to win, but on the other hand he wants whoever wins the most votes to win. This has become known as [[Wollheim's paradox]].

His ''Art and its Objects'' was one of the twentieth century's most influential texts on philosophical [[aesthetics]] in English. In a 1965 essay, '[[Minimal Art]]', he seems to have coined the phrase, although its meaning eventually drifted from his. As well as for his work on the philosophy of art, Wollheim was known for his philosophical treatments of [[depth psychology]], especially [[Sigmund Freud]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;He was also Ernest Jones Lecturer at the Institute of Psychoanalysis in London in 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; His posthumously-published autobiography of youth, ''Germs: A Memoir of Childhood'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://waywiser-press.com/wollheim.html For excerpts from eighteen reviews, see] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120153441/http://www.waywiser-press.com/wollheim.html |date=20 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with complementary essays, discloses a good deal about his family background and his life up to early manhood, providing valuable material for understanding his interests and sensibility.

==Publications==
For an extensive bibliography of Richard Wollheim's publications by a professional bibliographer, see Eddie Yeghiayan's UC-Irvine site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.uci.edu/about/publications/hri/index.html?page=wollheim Richard Wollheim Bibliography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; See also the 'Philweb' listing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillwebb.net/History/TwentiethCentury/Analytic/Recent/Wollheim/Wollheim.htm Richard Wollheim&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: given his unique mind, personality, and distinctive writing styles, along with his curiosity and sociability, many of Richard Wollheim's publications are outside academic categories. Besides books, he published many articles, in journals and edited collections, book reviews, and gallery catalogues for shows. He also left writings in manuscript, letters and recordings of his talks.

Although the [[genre]] is very old, the '''romance novel''' or '''romantic novel''' discussed in this article is the [[mass-market]] [[genre literature|version]]. [[Novel]]s of this type of [[genre fiction]] place their primary focus on the relationship and [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] between two people, and must have an "emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending."&lt;ref name="rwadefn"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Romance Genre Overview | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]] | url =http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=578 | accessdate = November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many subgenres of the romance novel, including [[fantasy]], [[historical romance]], [[paranormal fiction]], and [[science fiction]]. 

The term ''romance'' is also applied to a type of novel defined by [[Walter Scott]] as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Scott, Walter &amp; Maning, Susan (Editor) |title=Essay on Romance|work=Prose Works|volume= vi|page= 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Scott, Walter |title=Introduction|work=Quentin Durand|location= Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A thriving genre of works conventionally referred to as "romance novels" existed in ancient Greece.&lt;ref name="Collected Ancient Greek Novels"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reardon|first1=Bryan P.|title=Collected Ancient Greek Novels|date=1989|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-04306-5|pages=1–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MA7rRGBC7IMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other precursors can be found in the literary fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries, including [[Samuel Richardson]]'s [[sentimental novel]] ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740) and the novels of [[Jane Austen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Regis, Pamela |title=A Natural History of the Romance Novel|publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press|date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austen inspired [[Georgette Heyer]], the British author of historical romance set around the time Austen lived, as well as [[detective fiction]]. Heyer's first romance novel, ''The Black Moth'' (1921), was set in 1751.

The [[United Kingdom|British]] company [[Mills and Boon]] began releasing [[escapist fiction]] for women in the 1930s. Their books were sold in [[North America]] by [[Harlequin Enterprises Ltd]], which began [[direct marketing]] to readers and allowing [[mass-market]] merchandisers to carry the books.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
&lt;!-- prove it: 
An early American example of a mass-market romance was [[Kathleen Woodiwiss]]' ''[[The Flame and the Flower]]'' (1972), published by [[Avon Books]]. This was the first single-title romance novel to be published as an original [[paperback]] in the US, though in the UK the romance genre was long established through the works of [[Georgette Heyer]], and from the 1950s [[Catherine Cookson]], as well as others.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Nancy Coffey was the senior editor who negotiated a multi-book deal with Woodiwiss. The genre boomed in the 1980s, with the addition of many different categories of romance and an increased number of single-title romances, but popular authors started pushing the boundaries of both the genre and plot, as well as creating more contemporary characters.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In North America, romance novels are the most popular literary genre, comprising almost 55% of all paperback books sold in 2004.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The genre is also popular in Europe and Australia, and romance novels appear in 90 languages. Most of the books, however, are written by authors from English-speaking countries, leading to an Anglo-Saxon perspective in the fiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Despite the popularity and widespread sales of romance novels, the genre has attracted significant derision, skepticism, and criticism.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Romance erotica seems to be on the rise as more women explore this new subgenre.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
''Erotica'' is a term used to describe scenes in the novel that are risqué but not pornographic.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} --&gt;

==Definition==
{{rquote|right|Women will pick up a romance novel knowing what to expect, and this foreknowledge of the reader is very important. When the hero and heroine meet and fall in love, maybe they don't know they're in love but the reader does. Then a conflict will draw them apart, but you know in the end they'll be back together, and preferably married or planning to be by page 192.|Joan Schulhafer of Pocket Books, 1982{{r|nyt1982}}}}

According to the [[Romance Writers of America]], the main plot of a mass-market romance novel must revolve about the two people as they develop romantic love for each other and work to build a relationship. Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain [[subplot]]s that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Furthermore, a romance novel must have an "emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending." Others, including Leslie Gelbman, a president of [[Berkley Books]], define the genre more simply, stating only that a romance must make the "romantic relationship between the hero and the heroine ... the core of the book."&lt;ref name="whatsinaname"&gt;{{Cite news|title=What's in a Name? |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=July 2, 2001 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleId=CA91257&amp;display=searchResults |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212184432/http://www.publishersweekly.com/index.asp?layout=article |archivedate=February 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, romance novels reward characters who are good people and penalize those who are evil, and a couple who fights for and believes in their relationship will likely be rewarded with unconditional love.&lt;ref name="rwadefn"/&gt; Bestselling author [[Nora Roberts]] sums up the genre, saying: "The books are about the celebration of falling in love and emotion and commitment, and all of those things we really want."&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt; [[Women's fiction]] (including "[[chick lit]]") is not directly a subcategory of the romance novel genre, because in women's fiction the heroine's relationship with her family or friends may be as important as her relationship with the hero.&lt;ref name="whatsinaname"/&gt;

Some romance novel authors and readers believe the genre has additional restrictions, from plot considerations (such as the [[protagonists]]' meeting early on in the story), to avoiding themes (such as [[adultery]]). Other disagreements have centered on the firm requirement for a happy ending; some readers admit stories without a happy ending, if the focus of the story is on the [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] between the two main characters (e.g., ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''). While the majority of romance novels meet the stricter criteria, there are also many books widely considered to be romance novels that deviate from these rules. Therefore, the general definition, as embraced by the RWA and publishers, includes only the focus on a developing romantic relationship and an optimistic ending.&lt;ref name="crusiedefn"&gt;{{Cite journal  | first =Jennifer  | last =Crusie  | author-link =Jennifer Crusie  | contribution =I Know What It Is When I Read It: Defining the Romance Genre  | contribution-url =http://www.jennycrusie.com/essays/definingromancegenre.php  | date =March 2000  | publisher =PAN  | title =Romance Writer's Report  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dorchester"/&gt; [[Escapism]] is important; an Avon executive observed that "The phone never rings, the baby never cries and the rent's never overdue in romances".{{r|nyt1982}}

As long as a romance novel meets those twin criteria, it can be set in any time period and in any location. There are no specific restrictions on what can or cannot be included in a romance novel.&lt;ref name="rwadefn"/&gt; Even controversial subjects are addressed in romance novels, including topics such as date rape, domestic violence, addiction, and disability.&lt;ref name="whitepamela"/&gt; The combination of time frame, location, and plot elements does, however, help a novel to fit into one of several romance subgenres.&lt;ref name="rwadefn"/&gt; Despite the numerous possibilities this framework allows, many people in the mainstream press claim that "all [romance novels] seem to read alike."&lt;ref name="gold30"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Gold  | first = Laurie  | title = Laurie's News and Views - Issue No. 30  | publisher = All About Romance Novels  | date = July 30, 1997  | url = http://www.likesbooks.com/30.html  | accessdate = April 23, 2007  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211115303/http://www.likesbooks.com/30.html  | archivedate = February 11, 2007  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes of the romance genre abound.

==History==

===Development===
[[File:Charles Gleyre - Daphnis et Chloe revenant de la montagne.jpg|thumb|A nineteenth-century painting by the Swiss-French painter [[Charles Gleyre|Marc Gabriel Charles Gleyre]] depicting a scene from [[Longus]]'s ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'']]

While this article is about the mass-market form of love romance novels, the genre of works of extended prose fiction dealing with romantic love existed in classical Greece.&lt;ref name="Collected Ancient Greek Novels"/&gt; The titles of over twenty such [[ancient Greek novel|ancient Greek romance novels]] are known, but most of them have only survived in an incomplete, fragmentary form.&lt;ref name="Collected Ancient Greek Novels"/&gt; Only five ancient Greek romance novels have survived to the present day in a state of near-completion: ''[[Chariton|Chareas and Callirhoe]]'', ''[[Leucippe and Clitophon]]'', ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'', ''[[Ephesian Tale|The Ephesian Tale]]'', and ''[[Aethiopica|The Ethiopian Tale]]''.&lt;ref name="Collected Ancient Greek Novels"/&gt;

Precursors of the modern popular love-romance can also be found in the [[sentimental novel]] ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]],'' by [[Samuel Richardson]], published in 1740. ''Pamela'' was the first popular novel to be based on a courtship as told from the perspective of the heroine. Unlike many of the novels of the time, ''Pamela'' had a happy ending, when after Mr. B attempts unsuccessfully to seduce and rape Pamela multiple times, he eventually rewards her virtue by sincerely proposing an equitable marriage to her. The book was one of the first bestsellers, with five editions printed in the first eleven months of release.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), pp. 63, 64, 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jane Austen]] is an important influence on romance [[genre fiction]], and ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', published in 1813, has been called "the best romance novel ever written".&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), p 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of the [[Victorian era]], the [[Brontë|Brontë sisters]], like Austen, wrote [[literary fiction]] that influenced later popular fiction. [[Charlotte Brontë]] in ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', published in 1847, introduced the orphaned heroine. Brontë's love romance incorporates elements of both the [[Gothic fiction|gothic novel]] and [[Elizabethan drama]], and  "demonstrate[s] the flexibility of the romance novel form."&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the literary fiction romance continued to develop in the 20th century, the new subgenre of genre fiction, which first developed in the 19th century, started to become more popular after the [[First World War]]. In 1919, [[E.M. Hull]]'s novel ''[[The Sheik (novel)|The Sheik]]'' was published in the [[United Kingdom]]. The novel, which became hugely popular, was adapted into a [[The Sheik (film)|movie]] (1921), which established star [[Rudolph Valentino]] as the top male actor of the time. The hero of this book was an iconic [[alpha male]] who kidnapped the heroine and won her admiration through his forceful actions. The novel was one of the first modern works to introduce the [[rape fantasy]], a theme explored in Samuel Richardson's ''Pamela'' (1740). Although women were gaining more independence in life, publishers believed that readers would only accept premarital sex in the context of rape. In this novel and those that followed, the rape was depicted as more of a fantasy; the heroine is rarely if ever shown experiencing terror, stress, or trauma as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), pp. 115–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular, mass market version of the [[historical novel|historical romance]], which [[Walter Scott]] developed in the early 19th century, is seen as beginning in 1921, when [[Georgette Heyer]] published ''The Black Moth''. This is set in 1751, but many of Heyer's novels were inspired by Jane Austen's novels and are set around the time Austen lived, in the later [[Regency period]]. Because Heyer's romances are set more than 100 years earlier, she includes carefully researched historical detail to help her readers understand the period.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other popular love-romance novels of the time, Heyer's novels used the setting as a major plot device. Her characters often exhibit twentieth century sensibilities, and more conventional characters in the novels point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Heyer was a prolific author, and wrote one to two historical romance novels per year until her death in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), p 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the category romance===
In the 1930s, the British publishers [[Mills and Boon]] began releasing hardback romance novels. The books were sold through weekly two-penny libraries and were known as "the books in brown" for their brown binding. In the 1950s, the company began offering the books for sale through newsagents across
the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="mandb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mills &amp; Boon - Our History|url=http://www.millsandboon.co.uk/cgi-bin/millsandboon.filereader?461262c700a12d24273f58d0dc9e068f+EN/catalogs/1124|publisher=Harlequin Mills and Boon|accessdate=July 19, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013164823/http://millsandboon.co.uk/cgi-bin/millsandboon.filereader?461262c700a12d24273f58d0dc9e068f+EN%2Fcatalogs%2F1124|archivedate=October 13, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Canadian company, [[Harlequin Enterprises]], began distributing in North America in 1957 the category romances published by Mills and Boon.&lt;ref name="Thurston 1987, p. 42"&gt;Thurston (1987), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Bonneycastle, wife of Harlequin founder Richard Bonneycastle, and her daughter, Judy Burgess, exercised editorial control over which Mills and Boon novels Harlequin reprinted. They had a "decency code," and rejected more sexually explicit material that Mills and Boon submitted for reprinting. Realizing that the genre was popular, Richard Bonneycastle finally decided to read a romance novel. He chose one of the more explicit novels and enjoyed it. On his orders, the company conducted a market test with the novel he had read and discovered that it outsold a similar, tamer novel.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the novels were short and formulaic, featuring heroines who were sweet, compassionate, pure and innocent. The few heroines who worked did so in traditional female jobs, including as [[nurse]]s, [[governess]]es and [[secretary|secretaries]]. Intimacy in the novels never extended beyond a chaste kiss between the protagonists.&lt;ref name="Thurston 1987, p. 42"/&gt;

On October 1, 1971, Harlequin purchased Mills and Boon. By this point, the romance novel genre "had been popularized and distributed widely to an enthusiastic audience" in [[Great Britain]]. In an attempt to duplicate Mills and Boon's success in North America, Harlequin improved their distribution and marketing system.&lt;ref name="Regis 2003, p. 156"&gt;Regis (2003), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; By choosing to sell their books "where the women are," they allowed many mass-market merchandisers and even supermarkets to sell the books, all of which were exactly 192 pages. Harlequin then began a reader service, selling directly to readers who agreed to purchase a certain number of books each month.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===&lt;span id="Birth of modern romance"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The beginnings of American romance fiction===
In the US, modern romance genre fiction was born in 1972, with [[Avon Books|Avon's]] publication of [[Kathleen Woodiwiss]]'s ''[[The Flame and the Flower]]'', which was the first of the modern "bodice ripper" romance novels to follow "the principals into the bedroom."&lt;ref name="athitakis"&gt;{{Cite news   | last = Athitakis  | first = Mark  | title = A Romance Glossary  | newspaper = SF Weekly  | date = July 25, 2001  | url =http://www.sfweekly.com/2001-07-25/news/a-romance-glossary/  | accessdate = April 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zaitchik"/&gt; Aside from its content, the book was revolutionary in that it was one of the first single-title romance novels to be published as an original [[paperback]], rather than being first published in [[hardcover]], and, like the category romances, was distributed in drug stores and other mass-market merchandising outlets.&lt;ref name="thurston4748"/&gt; The novel went on to sell 2.35 million copies.&lt;ref name="darrach"&gt;{{Cite news  | last =Darrach  | first =Brad  | title = Rosemary's Babies    | newspaper = Time| date = January 17, 1977    | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918604-2,00.html|accessdate=July 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avon followed its release with the 1974 publication of Woodiwiss's second novel, ''The Wolf and the Dove'' and two more sexually graphic novels by newcomer [[Rosemary Rogers]], ''Sweet Savage Love'' and ''Dark Fires''. The latter sold two million copies in its first three months of release. By 1975, ''Publishers Weekly'' had reported that the "Avon originals" had sold a combined {{nowrap|8 million copies}}.&lt;ref name="thurston4748"&gt;Thurston, pp 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year over 150 historical romance novels, many of them paperback originals, were published, selling over {{nowrap|40 million copies}}.&lt;ref name="darrach"/&gt;

The success of these novels prompted a new style of writing romance, concentrating primarily on historical fiction tracking the monogamous relationship between a helpless heroine and the hero who rescued her, even if he had been the one to place her in danger.&lt;ref name="whitepamela"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = White  | first = Pamela  | title = Romancing Society  | newspaper = Boulder Weekly  | date = August 15, 2002  | url = http://www.boulderweekly.com/archive/081502/coverstory.html  | accessdate = April 23, 2007  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070904133155/http://www.boulderweekly.com/archive/081502/coverstory.html  | archivedate = September 4, 2007  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The covers of these novels tended to feature scantily clad women being grabbed by the hero, and caused the novels to be referred to as '''bodice-rippers'''.&lt;ref name="athitakis"/&gt; A ''[[Wall St. Journal]]'' article in 1980 referred to these bodice rippers as "publishing's answer to the Big Mac: They are juicy, cheap, predictable, and devoured in stupefying quantities by legions of loyal fans."&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, p 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''bodice-ripper'' is now considered offensive to many in the romance industry.&lt;ref name="athitakis"/&gt;

In this new style of historical romance, heroines were independent and strong-willed and were often paired with heroes who evolved into caring and compassionate men who truly admired the women they loved.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, p 72.&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to the contemporary romances published during this time, which were often characterized by weak females who fell in love with overbearing [[alpha male]]s.&lt;ref name="grossman"/&gt; Although these heroines had active roles in the plot, they were "passive in relationships with the heroes."&lt;ref name="crusie"/&gt; Across the genre, heroines during this time were usually aged 16–21, with the heroes slightly older, usually around 30. The women were [[virgins]], while the men were not, and both members of the couple were described as beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, p 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Category romance adapts===
Category romance lines were slower to react to some of the changes that had swept the historical romance subgenre. Despite the fact that the former Mills &amp; Boon lines were now owned by a [[North America]]n company, the lines did not have any American writers until 1975, when Harlequin purchased a novel by [[Janet Dailey]].&lt;ref&gt;Thurston (1987), pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; Dailey's novels provided the romance genre's "first look at heroines, heroes and courtships that take place in America, with American sensibilities, assumptions, history, and most of all, settings."&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Harlequin was unsure how the market would react to this new type of romance, and was unwilling to fully embrace it. In the late 1970s, a Harlequin editor rejected a manuscript by [[Nora Roberts]], who has since become the top-selling romance author, because "they already had their American writer."&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), pp. 158, 183, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harlequin sold almost $70 million of its paperback romances in 1979 through 100,000 supermarkets and other stores, giving the company almost 10% of the market for paperback books. That year the company began distributing its own books in the United States instead of through [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]'s [[Pocket Books]]. In 1980 Simon &amp; Schuster formed Silhouette Books to publish its own romance novels, beginning what ''The New York Times'' called "perhaps the most bitter war in American book publishing history".&lt;ref name="walters19801012"&gt;{{cite news | title=Paperback Talk | work=The New York Times | date=October 12, 1980 | author=Walters, Ray | pages=A47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company sought to take advantage of the untapped talent of the American writers.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), pp. 156, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; They published several lines of category romance, and encouraged their writers to create stronger heroines and less dominant heroes. Authors were also expected to address contemporary issues where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Silhouette soon saw their market share expand, and in 1984, Harlequin acquired them. Despite the acquisition, Silhouette continued to retain editorial control and to publish various lines under their own imprint.&lt;ref name="Regis 2003, p. 156"/&gt;

Harlequin had also failed to adapt quickly to the signs that readers appreciated novels with more explicit sex scenes, and in 1980, several publishers entered the category romance market to fill that gap. That year, Dell launched their Candlelight Ecstasy line with [[Amii Lorin]]'s ''The Tawny Gold Man'', becoming the first line to waive the requirement that heroines be virgins. By the end of 1983 sales for the Candlelight Ecstasy line totaled $30 million. Silhoeutte also launched similar lines, Desire (sexually explicit) and Special Edition (sexually explicit and longer stories, up to 250 pages), each of which had a 90–100% sellout rate each month.&lt;ref name="barret"&gt;{{Cite news  | last =Barrett  | first =Mary Ellin  | title =Pure as the Driven Slush  | newspaper =Family Weekly  | date =January 9, 1983  | url =http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%203.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate =May 24, 2007  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004649/http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%203.pdf  | archivedate =September 27, 2007  | df =mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1982 survey of romance readers confirmed that the new styles of writing were attracting new readers to the genre. 35% of the readers surveyed had begun reading romances after 1977. An additional 31% of those surveyed had been readers for between 6 and 10 years, meaning they had become interested in the genre after 1972, when Woodiwiss's revolutionary novel was published. This means that two-thirds of those surveyed joined the genre after it had begun to change.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, pp. 127-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of category romance lines increased at a rapid pace, and by 1985 there were 16 separate lines producing a total of 80 novels per month.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden increase in category romance lines meant an equally sudden increase in demand for writers of the new style of romance novel. This tight market caused a proportionate decrease in the quality of the novels that were being released. By 1984, the market was saturated with category lines and readers had begun to complain of redundancy in plots.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, p 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the "dampening effect of the high level of redundancy associated with series romances was evident in the decreased number of titles being read per month."&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, p 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Harlequin's return rate, which had been less than 25% in 1978, when it was the primary provider of category romance, swelled to 60%.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, p 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further change===
The genre continued to expand in the mid-to-late 1980s, as publishers realized that the more popular authors were often those who stretched the boundaries of the genre. A 1984 novel by [[LaVyrle Spencer]] featured an overweight, middle-aged hero who had to make drastic changes to his lifestyle to win the heroine, while a 1987 Dailey novel involved an ugly hero and a heroine who was searching for her birth mother.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, p 109.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jayne Ann Krentz]]'s 1986 novel ''Sweet Starfire'' became the first futuristic romance, combining elements of traditional romance novels and [[science fiction]].&lt;ref name="gelsomino"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gelsomino|first=Tara|title=Review of Smoke in Mirrors|url=http://www.romantictimes.com/books_review.php?cameo=1&amp;book=14972|publisher=Romantic Times|year=2002|accessdate=July 26, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071004201147/http://www.romantictimes.com/books_review.php?cameo=1&amp;book=14972 |archivedate = October 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationships had also modernized: by the 1990s, it was rare to see a book that featured a man raping his future wife.&lt;ref name="grossman"&gt;{{Cite news  | last =Grossman  | first =Lev  | author-link =Lev Grossman  | title =Rewriting the Romance  | newspaper =Time  | date =February 3, 2003  | url =http://www.juliaquinn.com/images/news/time-specific/time-magazine/JuliaQuinn.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate =April 3, 2007  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070712042909/http://www.juliaquinn.com/images/news/time-specific/time-magazine/JuliaQuinn.pdf  | archivedate =July 12, 2007  | df =mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the mid-to-late 1980s, contemporary romances began to feature women in more male-dominated jobs, such as offshore oil rigs and the space program. The age range of heroines also began to expand, so that books began to feature women who had already reached 30 and even 40. Heroes also changed, with some authors veering towards a more sensitive man. Despite the broadening of some aspects of the plot, other taboos remained, and publishers discouraged authors from writing about controversial subjects such as terrorism, warfare, and masculine sports.&lt;ref name="ew1991"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Rules of the Game|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,315222,00.html|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=August 16, 1991|accessdate=July 19, 2007|first=Sarah|last=Bird}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romance novels began to contain more humor beginning in the 1990s, as [[Julie Garwood]] began introducing a great deal of humor into her historical romances.&lt;ref name="arr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Susan Wiggs - And Now (as usual), Something New|publisher=All About Romance Novels|url=http://www.likesbooks.com/susanwiggs.html|date=May 25, 2003|accessdate=July 25, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010904/http://www.likesbooks.com/susanwiggs.html|archivedate=September 28, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The romance novel began to expand in other ways as well.&lt;ref name="park"/&gt;  In 1989, author [[Jude Deveraux]] became the first romance author to transition from writing original mass market paperbacks to being published in hardcover. Her novel, ''A Knight in Shining Armor'', "became a natural bestseller."&lt;ref name="whatsinaname"/&gt;  Several authors found success writing single-title romances set in contemporary times, and publishing houses began to encourage the growth in the genre. Because the novels were set in modern times, they could include more of the elements that modern women could relate to, and soon began to touch on themes such as single parenthood, adoption, and abuse.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite news   | last = Park  | first = Michael Y. | title = Reading True Romance | publisher = Fox News  | date = August 28, 2002 | url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,61370,00.html  | accessdate = April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000, the covers had begun to evolve from featuring a scantily clad couple to instead showing a view of the landscape featured in the novel.&lt;ref name="whatsinaname"/&gt;

As women's career options have expanded in real life, so have those of their fictional counterparts. In the earliest Harlequin romance novels, heroines were typically nurses and secretaries. As time has passed and women have entered the workforce in larger numbers, romance heroines have spanned the career spectrum.&lt;ref name="witmer"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Witmer  | first = Karyn  | title = Of Books and Baby Boomers  | publisher = All About Romance  | date = August 28, 2006  | url = http://www.likesbooks.com/236.html  | accessdate = April 30, 2007  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070714090837/http://www.likesbooks.com/236.html  | archivedate = July 14, 2007  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern romance novels now feature more balanced relationships between men and women.&lt;ref name="whitepamela"/&gt;

==Critical attention==

The romance genre has been popularly derided and critically ignored.

Despite recent rehabilitation and merging of the genre with other genres, the stigma attached to the romance genre continues to be strong, with some dedicated readers embarrassed to admit to buying or even reading the books.&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Gray  | first = Paul   | title = Passion on the Pages | newspaper = Time  | date = March 20, 2000  | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996381,00.html  | accessdate = April 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The romance genre has over the years generated significant derision, skepticism and criticism. Some critics point to a lack of suspense, as it is obvious that the hero and heroine will eventually resolve their issues, and wonder whether it is beneficial "for women to be whiling away so many hours reading impossibly glamorized love stories."&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt;  According to fiction author Melissa Pritchard, a romance novel "perpetuates something slightly dangerous, that there's this notion, that there's this perfect love out there, and it can distract you from the work of loving yourself."&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Hall  | first = Melissa Mia  | title = Wickedly Savage Passions  | newspaper = Publishers Weekly  | date = February 23, 2004  | url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA385469.html?q=%22romance+novel%22  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071113130510/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA385469.html?q=%22romance+novel%22  | dead-url = yes  | archive-date = November 13, 2007  | accessdate = April 30, 2007  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romance novelists attribute the stigma to the fact that romance is the only genre "written almost exclusively by women for women."&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt; Romance novelist [[Jennifer Crusie]] counters that in the modern romance novel "a woman is rewarded with unconditional love [only] if she remains true to herself",&lt;ref name="crusie"&gt;{{Cite book  | isbn =9780879727772  | first =Jennifer  | last =Crusie  | author-link =Jennifer Crusie  | editor-last =Kaler  | editor-first =Anne  | editor2-last =Johnson-Kurek  | editor2-first =Rosemary  | chapter =This Is Not Your Mother's Cinderella: The Romance Novel as Feminist Fairy Tale  | chapter-url =http://www.jennycrusie.com/essays/thisisnotyourmothers.php  | title =Romantic Conventions  | year =1998  | pages =51–61  | publisher =Bowling Green Press  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090202091538/http://jennycrusie.com/essays/thisisnotyourmothers.php  | archivedate =February 2, 2009  | df =mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while novelist [[Susan Elizabeth Phillips]] believes that romance novels are popular because the heroine always wins, sometimes overcoming great odds so that she is no longer a victim.&lt;ref name="leopold"/&gt;

==Formats==
&lt;!--[[File:Thetawnygoldman.jpg|thumb|right|Note the number 1 in the upper right corner, indicating that this book was the first release in the Dell Candlelight Ecstasy category.{{Deletable image-caption|Friday, January 14, 2011|date=March 2012}}]]--&gt;
Romance novels are divided into two sub-sets, category romances, also known as series romances, and single title romances.&lt;ref name="rwadefn"/&gt;  Many authors write only within one of the formats, but others, including [[Jennifer Crusie]] and [[Jayne Ann Krentz]], have achieved success in both formats.&lt;ref name="pubweekly"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Eykelhof |first=Paula |last2=Macomber |first2=Debbie |author2-link=Debbie Macomber |title=Romancing the Store |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=July 31, 2006 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6357303.html |accessdate=April 16, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113130535/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6357303.html |archivedate=November 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Category romance===
[[File:Collection Nocturne de Harlequin.jpg|thumb|150px|Harlequin novels]]
Category romances are short, usually no more than 200 pages, or about 55,000 words.&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Hamilton   | first = Melissa  | title = Romance Categories: The Different Kinds of Romance  | publisher = Romance Ever After  | url =http://www.romanceeverafter.com/Romance%20Categories%20-%20The%20Different%20Types%20of%20Romance.htm  | accessdate = April 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=regis160&gt;Regis (2003), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The books are published in clearly delineated lines, with a certain number of books published in each line every month. In many cases, the books are numbered sequentially within the line.&lt;ref name="rwadefn"/&gt; These novels have widespread distribution—often worldwide—and a single U.S. print run, remaining on a bookseller's shelves until they are sold out or until the next month's titles are released and take their place.&lt;ref name="pubweekly"/&gt; Writers for the largest publisher of category romance, [[Harlequin Enterprises Ltd|Harlequin/Mills &amp; Boon]], can find their novels translated into 26 languages and sold in over 100 international markets.&lt;ref name="rna"&gt;{{cite web  | title = About Romantic Fiction | publisher = Romance Novelists' Association| url =http://www.rna-uk.org/index.php?page=romanticfiction  | accessdate = April 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To write a successful novel of this length, the "author must pare the story down to its essentials. Subplots and minor characters are eliminated or relegated to the backstory."&lt;ref name=regis160/&gt; Nonetheless, category romance lines each have a distinct identity, which may involve similar settings, characters, time periods, levels of sensuality, or types of conflict. Publishers of category romances usually issue guidelines for each line, specifying the elements necessary for a novel to be included in each line.&lt;ref name="eykelhof"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Eykelhof  | first = Paula  | title = Writing Guidelines: Harlequin Everlasting Love   | publisher = eHarlequin.com  | url =http://www.eharlequin.com/articlepage.html?articleId=1086&amp;chapter=0  | accessdate = April 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeglinski"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Jeglinski  | first = Melissa| title = Writing Guidelines: Silhouette Desire  | publisher = eHarlequin.com   | url =http://www.eharlequin.com/articlepage.html?articleId=553&amp;chapter=0  | accessdate = April 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toth519&gt;Toth (1998), p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on the current market and perceived reader preferences, publishers frequently begin new lines or end existing ones. Most recently, erotic and [[Christian]] lines have been introduced while traditional [[Regency romance]] lines have ended.&lt;ref name="rwaindstat"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Industry Statistics  | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]]  | year = 2008  | url = http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics/industry_statistics  | accessdate = July 23, 2010  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100723013021/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics/industry_statistics  | archivedate = July 23, 2010  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single-title romances===
Single-titles novels are romance novels not published as part of a publisher's category. They are longer than category romances, typically between 350 and 400 pages, or 100,000-110,000 words.&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt; Publishers may release the novels over a shorter period of time for sales and publicity reasons, but on average authors write 1.5 novels per year and have one each year published.&lt;ref name="whatsinaname"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rwaauthorstat"&gt;{{cite web | title = Author Statistics | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]]  | date =   | url =http://eweb.rwanational.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=rwa&amp;WebKey=7e2a43e2-6200-4323-8036-1e8890305b7a  | accessdate = July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-title novels remain on the booksellers' shelves at the discretion of the store.&lt;ref name="leopold"&gt;{{cite news | last = Leopold | first = Todd | title = Writing from the heart | publisher = [[CNN]]|date = August 11, 2000 | url =http://archives.cnn.com/2000/books/news/08/11/romance.writers/index.html  | accessdate = April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their name, single-title novels are not always stand alone novels. Some authors prefer to write several interconnected books, ranging in number from trilogies to long-running series, so that they can revisit characters or worlds. Such sets of books often have similar titles, and may be labelled as "Number 1 in the XXX Series", but they are not considered series romances because they are not part of a particular line.&lt;ref name="wardbly"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Ward  | first = Jean Marie | title = Eloisa James: Regencies with a Shakespearean Twist | publisher =  Crescent Blues| url =http://www.crescentblues.com/8_5issue/int_james.shtml  | accessdate = April 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the definition of a romance novel does not limit the types of plot devices, time frames, or locations that can be included, the genre has grown to encompass a wide variety of material and spawned multiple subgenres. Subgenres of romance are often closely related to other literature genres, and some books could be considered a romance subgenre novel and another genre novel at the same time. For example, romantic suspense novels are often similar to [[detective fiction|mysteries]], [[crime fiction]] and [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s, and [[paranormal romance]]s use elements popular in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] novels.

===Contemporary romance===
{{Main article|Contemporary romance}}
Contemporary romance, which is set after [[World War II]],&lt;ref name="rwasub"&gt;{{cite web | title = Romance Literature Subgenres | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]] | url = http://www.rwanational.org/cs/romance_literature_subgenres | accessdate = July 23, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100727064017/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/romance_literature_subgenres | archive-date = July 27, 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is often what people mean when they refer to a romance novel. Contemporary romance novels—the largest subgenre—are set in the time when they are written, and usually reflect the mores of that time. Heroines in contemporary romances prior to 1970 usually quit working when they marry or have children—while heroines after 1970 usually have, and keep, a career.&lt;ref name=ramsdell43&gt;Ramsdell (1999), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; As contemporary romance novels have grown to contain more complex plotting and more realistic characters, the line between this subgenre and the genre of women's fiction has blurred.&lt;ref name=ramsdell44/&gt;

Most contemporary romance novels contain elements that date the books. The majority of them eventually become irrelevant to more modern readers and go out of print.&lt;ref name=ramsdell44&gt;Ramsdell (1999), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Those that survive the test of time, such as [[Jane Austen]]'s work, are often reclassified as historical romances.&lt;ref name=ramsdell43/&gt;

Over half of the romantic fiction published in the United States in 2004 (1468 out of 2,285 books) were contemporary romance novels.&lt;ref name="rwastat"/&gt;  Contemporary romance novels have twice been chosen by [[Kelly Ripa]] to be featured in her Reading with Ripa book club.&lt;ref name="2003massmarket"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Year in Books 2003: Mass Market |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=November 17, 2003 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA336202.html?q=paranormal+romance+genre |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113130500/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA336202.html?q=paranormal+romance+genre |archivedate=November 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical romance===
{{Main article|Historical romance}}

Historical romance, also known as [[historical novel]], is a broad category of [[fiction]] which the plot takes place in a setting located in the past, which [[Walter Scott]] helped popularize in the early 19th-century, with works such as ''[[Rob Roy (novel)|Rob Roy]]'' and ''[[Ivanhoe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Rupert Christiansen | last = Christiansen | first = Rupert | origyear = 1988, Bodley Head, {{ISBN|0-37031117-5}}. Paperback reprints, Cardinal, 1989 {{ISBN|0-7474-0404-6}}; Vintage, 1994. {{ISBN|0-09936711-4}} | title = Romantic Affinities: Portraits From an Age, 1780–1830 | place = London | format = paperback | edition = reprint | publisher = Pimlico | year = 2004 | ISBN = 1-84413421-0 | pages = 192–96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Literary fiction]] historical romances continue to be published, and a notable recent example is ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' (2009), a multi-award-winning novel by English [[historical novel]]ist [[Hilary Mantel]]. However, the focus here is on the [[mass-market]] genre.

This subgenre includes a wide variety of other subgenres, including [[Regency romance]]. Mass-market historical romance novels are rarely published in hardcover, with fewer than 15 receiving that status each year, less than one-fifth of the number of contemporary romance novels published in that format. Because historical romances are primarily published in mass-market format, their fortunes are tied to a certain extent to the mass-market trends. Booksellers and large merchandisers now sell fewer mass market paperbacks, preferring trade paperbacks or hardcovers, which prevents historical romances from being sold in some price clubs and other mass merchandise outlets.&lt;ref name="dyer"/&gt;

In 2001, 778 mass-market historical romances were published, a 10-year high. By 2004, the annual number had dropped to 486, which was still 20% of all romance novels published. Kensington Books says they receive fewer submissions of historical novels, and their previously published authors have switched to contemporary.&lt;ref name="rwastat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dyer"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dyer |first=Lucinda |title=Romance: In Its Own Time |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=June 13, 2005 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA607853.html?industryid=23602&amp;industry=Romance+Books&amp;q=paranormal+romance+genre |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113130516/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA607853.html?industryid=23602&amp;industry=Romance+Books&amp;q=paranormal+romance+genre |archivedate=November 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romantic suspense===
Romantic suspense involves an intrigue or mystery for the protagonists to solve.&lt;ref name="rwasub"/&gt; Typically, however, the heroine is the victim of a crime or attempted crime, and works with a hero, who tends to be in a field where he would serve as a protector, such as a police officer, [[FBI|FBI agent]], bodyguard, or [[Navy SEAL]].&lt;ref name="textintransit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="day"&gt;{{Cite news   | last = Day  | first = Michele   | title = Love stories with suspense, humor top charts | newspaper = The Enquirer (Cincinnati, Ohio)  | date = August 13, 2002  | url =http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/08/13/tem_love_stories_with.html  | accessdate = April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the novel, the mystery is resolved and the interaction between the hero and heroine has evolved into a solid relationship.&lt;ref name="textintransit"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Romantic Suspense  | work = Text in Transit: A guide to genre in Popular Literature  | publisher = The Canada Research Chair Humanities Computing Studio  | date = May 21, 2005  | url = http://www.crcstudio.arts.ualberta.ca/textintransit/viewtext.php?s=browse&amp;tid=123  | accessdate = April 30, 2007  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527224440/http://www.crcstudio.arts.ualberta.ca/textintransit/viewtext.php?s=browse&amp;tid=123  | archivedate = May 27, 2008  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These novels primarily take place in contemporary times, but authors such as [[Amanda Quick]] have broadened the genre to also include historical timeframes.&lt;ref name="marble"&gt;{{cite web   | last = Marble  | first = Anne M. | title = The Subgenres of Romance  | publisher = Writing-World.Com  | year = 2001  | url =http://www.writing-world.com/romance/romgenres.shtml| accessdate = April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all romances, romantic suspense novels must place the development of a relationship between the protagonists at the heart of the story. The relationship "must impact each decision they make and increase the tension of the suspense as it propel the story. In turn, the events of suspense must also directly affect the relationship and move the story forward."&lt;ref name="clayton"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clayton |first=Becci |title=My Heroine is in Love With the Killer!  Romantic Suspense 101 |publisher=Heart of Denver Romance Writers |url=http://www.hodrw.com/romsuspense101.htm |accessdate=July 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929000523/http://www.hodrw.com/romsuspense101.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Romantic suspense novels tend to have more "clean" language, without the "emotional, intimate" descriptions often used in more traditional romances.&lt;ref name="clayton"/&gt; Because the mystery is a crucial aspect of the plot, these novels are more plot-driven instead of character-driven.&lt;ref name="clayton"/&gt;

This blend of the romance and mystery was perfected by [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]], who wrote ten romantic suspense novels between 1955 and 1967. Stewart was one of the first to seamlessly combine the two genres, maintaining a full mystery while focusing on the courtship between two people.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), pp. 143, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In her novels, the process of solving the mystery "helps to illuminate" the hero's personality, helping the heroine to fall in love with him.&lt;ref&gt;Regis (2003), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paranormal romance===
{{Main article|Paranormal romance}}
Paranormal romance blends the real with the fantastic or science fictional. The fantastic elements may be woven into an alternate version of our own world in an [[urban fantasy]] involving [[vampire]]s, demons, and/or werewolves, or they may be more "normal" manifestations of the paranormal—humans with psychic abilities, witches, or [[ghost]]s. [[Time travel]], futuristic, and extraterrestrial romances also fall beneath the paranormal umbrella.&lt;ref name="rwasub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paranormaldefn"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Paranormal Romance  | work = Text in Transit: A guide to genre in Popular Literature  | publisher = The Canada Research CHair Humanities Computing Studio  | date = May 25, 2004  | url = http://www.crcstudio.arts.ualberta.ca/textintransit/viewtext.php?s=browse&amp;tid=58  | accessdate = April 30, 2007  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20080512103028/http://www.crcstudio.arts.ualberta.ca/textintransit/viewtext.php?s=browse&amp;tid=58  | archivedate = May 12, 2008  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These novels often blend elements of other subgenres—including suspense, mystery, or chick lit—with their fantastic themes.&lt;ref name="arthur"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Arthur | first = Keri | title = Paranormal Romance and Urban Fantasy—defining two popular subgenres | publisher = The Romance Writers of Australia | year = 2007 | url = http://www.romanceaustralia.com/articles/urban.htm | accessdate = April 30, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070422235749/http://www.romanceaustralia.com/articles/urban.htm | archivedate = April 22, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few paranormal romances are set solely in the past and are structured much like any historical romance novel. Others are set in the future, sometimes on different worlds. Still others have a time-travel element with either the hero or the heroine traveling into the past or the future.&lt;ref name="dorchester"&gt;{{cite web | title = Submission Guidelines | publisher = Dorchester Publishing | url = http://www.dorchesterpub.com/Dorch/SubmissionGuidlines.cfm | accessdate = April 30, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070430230010/http://www.dorchesterpub.com/Dorch/SubmissionGuidlines.cfm | archivedate = April 30, 2007 | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2002 and 2004, the number of paranormal romances published in the United States doubled to 170 per year. A popular title in the genre can sell over 500,000 copies.&lt;ref name="luscombe"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Luscombe | first = Belinda | title = Well, Hello, Suckers |newspaper= Time | date = February 19, 2006 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1161234,00.html | accessdate = April 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many paranormal romances rely on the blend of contemporary American life with the existence of supernatural or magically empowered beings, human or otherwise. Sometimes the larger culture is aware of the magical in its midst; sometimes it is not. Some paranormal romances focus less on the specifics of their [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate worlds]] than do traditional science fiction or fantasy novels, keeping the attention strongly on the underlying romance.&lt;ref name="marble"/&gt; Others develop the [[Alternative universe (fan fiction)|alternate reality]] meticulously, combining well-planned magical systems and inhuman cultures with contemporary reality.

===Science fiction romance===
The first futuristic romance to be marketed by a mainstream romance publisher, [[Jayne Ann Krentz]]'s ''Sweet Starfire'', was published in 1986 and was a "classic road trip romance" that just happened to be set in a separate galaxy.&lt;ref name="gelsomino"/&gt; This genre has become more popular since 2000. Krentz attributes the popularity of this romance genre to the fact that the novels "are, at heart, classic historical romances that just happen to be set on other worlds."&lt;ref name="gelsomino"/&gt;

===Fantasy romance===
{{Main article|Romantic fantasy}}

Fantasy Romance, also known as Romantic Fantasy, is a [[Genre|subgenre]] of [[fantasy fiction]], describing a fantasy story using many of the elements and conventions of the romance genre. Romantic fantasy has been published by both fantasy and romance lines, with some publishers distinguishing between "fantasy romance" being more like a contemporary fantasy novel with romantic elements, and "romantic fantasy" with more emphasis on the romance elements of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Time-travel romances===
{{main|Time-travel romance}}
Time-travel romances are a version of the classic "fish out of water" story. In most, the heroine is from the present day and travels into the past to meet the hero. In a smaller subset of these novels, the hero, who lives in the past, travels forward into his future to meet the heroine. A successful time-travel romance must have the characters react logically to their experience and should investigate some of the differences, both physical and mental, between the world the character normally inhabits and the one where they landed. Some writers end their novels with the protagonists trapped in different time periods and unable to be together—to the displeasure of many readers of the genre.&lt;ref name="timetravel"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marble|first=Anne M.|title=Writing Time Travel Romances|publisher=Writing-world.Com|date=September 2002|url=http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble05.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626181045/http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble05.shtml |archivedate = June 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspirational romance===
Inspirational romance, as the market exists today, combines explicitly [[Christian fiction|Christian]] themes with the development of a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name="rwasub"/&gt; In 2004, 167 novels were published in the inspirational romance subgenre.&lt;ref name="rwastat"/&gt; These novels typically do not include gratuitous violence or swearing, and the central courtship is chaste. Sex, if it is present at all, occurs after marriage and is not explicitly detailed. Many novels in this genre also focus on the hero or heroine's faith, turning the love story into "a triangle: the man and the woman and also their relationship with God."&lt;ref name="duffy"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Duffy  | first = Martha | title = The Almighty To The Rescue | newspaper = Time  | date = November 13, 1995  | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983705,00.html  | accessdate = April 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Themes such as forgiveness, honesty, and fidelity are common.&lt;ref name="layne"&gt;{{cite web   | last = Layne  | first = Sandy | title = Christian Romance Novels? | publisher = Write to Inspire  | year = 2001  | url =http://www.writetoinspire.com/article1036.html  | accessdate = April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first line of series inspirational romances debuted shortly after the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 U.S. presidential election]], when Silhouette launched their Silhouette Inspirations line. The books were aimed at [[born-again Christian]]s and were marketed in religious bookstores. The Silhouette Inspirations line was closed after Harlequin acquired Silhouette in 1984 because it was not profitable.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, pp 190–192.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other Christian publishers continued to produce romance novels, including historical and contemporary, and Harlequin later rejoined the market with the 1998 launch of its Steeple Hill and Love Inspired lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Love Inspired Facebook page|url=https://www.facebook.com/LoveInspiredBooks/info|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multicultural romance typically features a hero and/or heroine who is [[African-American]], although some multicultural lines also include Asian or Hispanic heroes or heroines or [[Miscegenation|interracial]] relationships.&lt;ref name="dunfordetal"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dunford|first=Natalie|last2=Dyer|first2=Lucinda|last3=Holt|first3=Karen|last4=Rosen|first4=Judith|title=Toujours l'Amour|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=December 1, 2003|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA338936.html?industryid=23602&amp;industry=Romance+Books&amp;q=%22romance+novel%22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113130506/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA338936.html?industryid=23602&amp;industry=Romance+Books&amp;q=%22romance+novel%22|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 13, 2007|accessdate=April 30, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first line of multicultural romance novels, Arabesque, was launched by Kensington books in 1994. BET Books purchased the line in 1998, and the number of new authors that they publish has continued to expand each year. BET has also developed some of the Arabesque novels into made-for-television movies.&lt;ref name="adlerstein"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Adlerstein| first = David | title = Multicultural Book Room| newspaper = South Florida Business Journal  | date = September 8, 2000  | url =http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2000/09/11/smallb1.html  | accessdate = April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Kensington Publishing launched the first line of Latino romance novels - ENCANTO. The ENCANTO novels were originally released in two ways - a bilingual Spanish/English version and a Spanish only version. Two novels were published every month until late 2001, when the line went into hiatus. Despite the demise of the line, several of the ENCANTO authors have continued writing novels with Latino protagonists namely, Sylvia Mendoza, Tracy Montoya, Caridad Pineiro, Berta Platas, Lara Rios and Lynda Sandoval.

Although romance novels featuring African-Americans and Hispanic protagonists are becoming more popular, those featuring Asian or Asian-American characters are rare. Author [[Tess Gerritsen]] believes this is due to the fact that there are fewer Asian-American women who read romances: "We read romances because we want to feel good about love...in order to do that, the reader must identify with the heroine."&lt;ref name="nguyen"&gt;{{Cite news   | last = Nguyen  | first = Lan| title = The Color of Romance | newspaper =Audrey Magazine  | date = September 2005  | url =http://www.audreymagazine.com/Sep2005/Living03.asp| accessdate = April 30, 2007   | format = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406210723/http://www.audreymagazine.com/Sep2005/Living03.asp |archivedate = April 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic romance===
{{Main article|Erotic romance novels}}

Erotic romance is a blend of romance and [[erotica]]. Erotic romance novels are characterized by strong sexual content, but can contain elements of any of the other romance subgenres. Erotic romance novels tend to use more frank language, avoiding many of the euphemisms used in books with milder content. These novels also usually include more sex scenes, often focusing more on the sex act rather than being a more traditional love scene, and may include more unusual positions or acts.&lt;ref name="marbleerotic"/&gt; Despite a greater emphasis on the sex scenes, however, erotic romance is distinguishable from traditional [[pornography]]. Pornography concentrates on the sex acts, but erotic novels include well-developed characters and a plot that could exist without the sex acts.&lt;ref name="cooperposey"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper-Posey|first=Tracy|title=An End to Euphemisms: Is Erotica Right for You?|publisher=Writing-world.Com|year=2004|url=http://www.writing-world.com/romance/romantica.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erotic romances' lengths run from short stories to single-title novels. Some of these are published as part of a category, such as Harlequin Blaze, while others are published as part of an anthology and are only [[novella]] length. Even single-title erotic romances may be as short as a novella, however.&lt;ref name="marbleerotic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marble|first=Anne M.|title=Getting to Know the Erotic Romance Field|publisher=Writing-World.Com|date=January 2005|url=http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble23.shtml|accessdate=July 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211135434/http://www.writing-world.com/columns/romance/marble23.shtml |archivedate = February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the publishers of erotic romance are either [[small press]] publishers or [[electronic book]] publishers. Writers often have more leeway as to what types of erotic acts can be included when working with an electronic publisher than they would have when working with a print publisher.&lt;ref name=marbleerotic/&gt; The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly, leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books.&lt;ref name="avonred"&gt;{{cite web | title = Avon Red | publisher = [[Avon (publishers)]] | url =http://www.harpercollins.com/imprints/index.aspx?imprintid=518015| accessdate = May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some subjects are still considered taboo, even with erotic romance. Themes such as pedophilia, incest, and bestiality are discouraged by all publishers.&lt;ref name="marbleerotic"/&gt;

The market for erotic romances has grown rapidly. [[Ellora's Cave]], an electronic publisher that focuses on erotic romance, became the first electronic publisher recognized by the Romance Writers of America as a legitimate publisher.&lt;ref name="cooperposey"/&gt;

==Markets==

===North America===
The romance fiction market "has been impervious to the overall economic recession, with faithful readers spending up to $40 a month" on romance novels in 1982.&lt;ref name="nyt1982"&gt;
{{Cite news  | title = Expanding Romance Market  | newspaper = [[New York Times]]  | date =  March 8, 1982  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/08/business/expanding-romance-market.html |accessdate = May 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That year, paperback romances totaled $300 million in sales, and the total audience was estimated at 20 million readers. A survey of 600 regular romance readers the same year "found that they mirror the general population in age, education, and marital and socioeconomic status."  Over half of the women had at least some college education, and 40% were employed full-time. 60% of the women surveyed read at least one romance every two days. The women admitted to reading romances as an antidote to stress, for mental escape, and to learn about history and new careers.&lt;ref name="thurstonnewspaper"&gt;{{Cite news  | last =Thurston  | first =Carol  | title =The Liberation of Pulp Romances  | newspaper =Psychology Today  | date =April 1983  | format =PDF  | url =http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%2011.pdf  | accessdate =May 24, 2007  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070712042917/http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%2011.pdf  | archivedate =July 12, 2007  | df =mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|1982}} at least 25% of all paperbacks were romance novels;&lt;ref name="mcdowell19820110"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/10/books/the-paperback-evolution.html |title=The Paperback Evolution |last=McDowell |first=Edwin |date=1982-01-10 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-03-15 |page=7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 1991, they comprised 46% of all mass market paperbacks sold in the US. This expansion was due in part to voracious readers, with over half of Harlequin's customers purchasing 30 novels per month. By this time, the romance novel audience had become more educated, with 45% having a college degree, and more than half of the audience worked outside the home.&lt;ref name="linden"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Linden  | first = Dana Wechsler  | last2 = Rees  | first2 = Matt  | title = I'm Hungry But Not For Food  | newspaper = [[Forbes]]  | date = June 6, 1922  | format = PDF  | url = http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%204.pdf  | accessdate = May 24, 2007  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712042909/http://www.cherylclarke.net/cherylclarke.net%20folder/cherylclarke.net/pdf_files/Binder%204.pdf  | archivedate = July 12, 2007  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 2000s, romance had become the most popular genre in modern literature. In 2008, romantic fiction generated $1.37 billion in sales, with 7,311 romance novels published and making up 13.5% of the consumer book market. Over 74 million people claimed to have read at least one romance novel in 2008, according to a Romance Writers of America study. The study reported that 9.5% of romance readers identified themselves as male, and that romance readers were more likely to be married or living with a partner. According to the RWA 84% of romance buyers were women and 16% were men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=582&lt;/ref&gt; Of the entire American population, 24.6% read at least one romance novel in 2008.&lt;ref name="rwastat"&gt;{{cite web | title = Readership Statistics  | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]]  | year = 2008  | url =http://www.rwanational.org/cs/readership_stats  | accessdate = July 23, 2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International markets===
{{rquote|right|Along with cowboys and horses, the authors were told to skip ethnic heroes [for European readers] and not to let family members steal too much of the limelight. "But secret babies sell quite well, as do marriages of convenience, or arranged marriages and, of course, alpha heroes," Stoecker said.|''The New York Times'', 2004{{r|povoledo}}}}
74.8 million people read an English-language romance novel in 2008.{{r|ogas20110430}} Harlequin sells more than 4 books per second, half of them internationally. Author [[Heather Graham Pozzessere|Heather Graham]] attributes this to the fact that "emotions translate easily."&lt;ref name="larsen"&gt;{{cite web   | last = Larsen  | first = Kristin | title = Romance Writers are Passionate About Their Work   | publisher =Voice of America   | date = August 9, 2005  | url =http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-08/2005-08-09-voa26.cfm?CFID=70475929&amp;CFTOKEN=58000274| archive-url =http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080916010627/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2005-08/2005-08-09-voa26.cfm| dead-url =yes| archive-date =September 16, 2008| accessdate = April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the United Kingdom, over 20% of all fiction books sold each year are romance novels.&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Labour of love a boon for Mary|date=June 14, 2007|newspaper=Cambridge Evening News|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/features/2007/06/14/356f5561-3b3a-49b5-ab9a-234b592b7f84.lpf|accessdate=July 19, 2007|format=|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703222725/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/features/2007/06/14/356f5561-3b3a-49b5-ab9a-234b592b7f84.lpf |archivedate = July 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although romance novels are translated into over 90 languages,&lt;ref name="zaitchik"/&gt; the majority of authors of these works are from Great Britain, the United States, Canada or, to a lesser extent, Australia.&lt;ref name="povoledo"/&gt; In France, where over 12 million romance novels are sold each year, all are translations.&lt;ref name="zaitchik"/&gt; and some publishing companies in Germany refuse to allow their romance authors to use their own names, fearing that the German audience will not buy a romance novel that does not have an Anglo-American pseudonym.&lt;ref name="povoledo"/&gt;

The [[English people|Anglo-Saxon]] perspective in the fiction at times can be much less successful in a European market. Although Italy is the strongest foreign market for the chick lit sold by single-title imprint Red Dress Ink, in that country romance readers do not care to read books about [[cowboy]]s, as this type of occupation was not common in their culture. The paranormal romance genre is not popular in countries such as Poland and Russia, although historical romance tends to be very successful.&lt;ref name="povoledo"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Povoledo  | first = Elisabetta   | title = Women's Fiction for Europe: 'No cowboys, no babies'  | newspaper = ''The New York Times''  | date = October 18, 2004  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/18/business/worldbusiness/18iht-books18_ed3_.html?_r=1  | accessdate = April 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspirational romance does not sell well in Europe, where romances that feature babies are very popular.&lt;ref name="zaitchik"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Zaitchik  | first = Alexander | title = The Romance Writers of America convention is just super | newspaper =New York Press  | date = July 22, 2003  | url =http://nypress.com/its-nothing-but-love-at-the-romance-writers-of-america-convention/ | accessdate = April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; German readers enjoy reading more erotic romance novels,&lt;ref name="povoledo"/&gt; and some German translations of English romance novels expand or insert love scenes into otherwise tame stories.

In 2004, sales of romance novels in Australia increased 28% over the year before. Between 1999 and 2004 there was an increase of 40–50% in the number of new titles released.

[[File:Sri Ramana Maharshi - Portrait - G. G Welling - 1948.jpg|thumb|262px|[[Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi]]. An Indian guru who advocated Self-enquiry.]]
{{Advaita}}
'''Self-enquiry''', also spelled '''self-inquiry''' (Sanskrit ''[[vichara]]'', also called ''[[jnana]]-vichara''{{sfn|Sadhu Om|2005|p=136}} or ''{{IAST|[[Atman (Hinduism)|ātma]]-vichār}}''), is the constant attention to the inner awareness of "I" or "I am" recommended by [[Ramana Maharshi]] as the most efficient and direct way of discovering the unreality of the [[Ahamkara|"I"-thought]].

Ramana taught that the "I"-thought will disappear and only "I-I"&lt;ref group=web name="I-I1"&gt;[http://davidgodman.org/rteach/iandii1.shtml David Godman (1991), '''I' and 'I-I' &amp;mdash; A Reader's Query'', The Mountain Path, 1991, pp. 79&amp;ndash;88.

==Etymology==
''' Vichāra ''' ([[Sanskrit]]: विचार) means deliberation; its root is वि (prefix to verbs and nouns it expresses) – चर्  (to move, roam, obtain knowledge of).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=the Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries Of South Asia|page=1422|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the faculty of discrimination between right and wrong; it is deliberation about cause and effect, and the final analysis;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Before the Beginning and after the End|author=Rishi Kumar Mishra|publisher=Rupa Publications|page=421|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ML3p93Eju9gC&amp;pg=PT421&amp;dq=Vichara+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vsuSVPHRJJCNuASQw4DwAw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Vichara%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also the enquiry into the nature of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], [[Satya]], [[Ishvara]] and [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Meditate, Focus and Concentrate|author=Swami Sivananda|publisher=Comet Content|page=236|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5Aa5BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=Vichara+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vsuSVPHRJJCNuASQw4DwAw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Vichara%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Sanskrit word, ''Vichāra'', does not have a corresponding word in English. ''Vichāra'' is reflection and contemplation upon the meaning of [[Vedanta|Vedantic truths]], and leads the individual to true knowledge, it leads to Brahman, the Universal Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedanta, the Science of Life|author=Swami Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|pages=494, 710|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=iOMYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Vichara+vedanta&amp;dq=Vichara+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YM2SVI7GJdCMuATm0ILIDg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vichara'' is also called ''jnana-vichara''{{sfn|Sadhu Om|2005|p=136}} or ''{{IAST|[[Atman (Hinduism)|ātma]]-[[Vichara|vichār]]}}'' by his devotees.

''Ātman'' ([[IAST]]: ātman, [[Sanskrit]]: आत्मन्) is a Sanskrit word that is usually translated as "[[self]]".{{refn|group=note|Though in the western world the word "Self" signifies the ''whole'' of the ''individual'' being, where-as in the Indian context it signifies the unchanging ''essence'' which is identical to [[Brahman]].}} The root *ēt-men (breath) is cognate with [[Old English]] "æþm", Greek "asthma", German "Atem": "atmen" (to breathe). It is derived from Latin "anima" (breath,soul), which is cognate to Sanskrit "ánilaḥ" (wind). Although "ánilaḥ" and "ātman" have similar meaning, they are not etymologically related.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In [[Hindu philosophy]], especially in the [[Vedanta]] school of [[Hinduism]], Ātman is the [[first principle]],{{sfn|Deussen|2010|p=86}} the ''true'' self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. To attain salvation ([[Moksha|liberation]]), a human being must acquire self-knowledge (atma [[jnana]]), which is to realise that one's true self (Ātman) is identical with the transcendent self [[Brahman]] (or [[paramatman]]).

Strictly speaking, "self-enquiry" is not the investigation of the "Self", "atman", but of the "I", "aham" (Sanskrit), "nan" (Tamil).

==Origins==

===Ramana Maharshi===
Ramana's teachings on Self-enquiry originated in his own awakening at age 16, when he became firmly aware of death. It made him aware of the Self. Ramana summarised his insight into "aham sphurana" (Self-awareness){{refn|group=note|David Godman: "Bhagavan frequently used the Sanskrit phrase aham sphurana to indicate the 'I-I' consciousness or experience. Aham means 'I' and sphurana can be translated as 'radiation, emanation, or pulsation'."&lt;ref group=web name="I-I1" /&gt;}} to a visitor in 1945:&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2"&gt;[http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.nl/2008/06/more-on-bhagavans-death-experience.html David Godman (23 June 2008), ''More on Bhagavan's death experience'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|An extensive account on Ramana's use of the words "Self", "I-I" and "aham sphurana" is given in &lt;ref group=web name="I-I1" /&gt;}}
{{quote|In the vision of death, though all the senses were benumbed, the aham sphurana (Self-awareness) was clearly evident, and so I realised that it was that awareness that we call "I", and not the body. This Self-awareness never decays. It is unrelated to anything. It is Self-luminous. Even if this body is burnt, it will not be affected. Hence, I realised on that very day so clearly that that was "I".&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2" /&gt;}}

At first, Ramana thought that he was possessed by a spirit, "which had taken up residence in his body".&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp1"&gt;[http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.nl/2008/05/bhagavans-death-experience.html David godman (7 May 2008), ''Bhagavan's death experience'', quoting from "the editor's introduction", The Mountain Path, 1981, pp. 67&amp;ndash;69]&lt;/ref&gt; This feeling remained for several weeks.&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp1" /&gt;

Later in life, he called his death experience ''akrama mukti'', "[[Subitism|sudden liberation]]", as opposed to the ''krama mukti'', "gradual liberation" as in the Vedanta path of [[jnana yoga]]:&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Rama P. Coomaraswamy: "[Krama-mukti is] to be distinguished from jîvan-mukti, the state of total and immediate liberation attained during this lifetime, and videha-mukti, the state of total liberation attained at the moment of death."{{sfn|Coomaraswamy|2004}} See &lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/realis/realis_6a.html Swami Krishnananda, ''The Attainment of Liberation: Progressive Salvation]&lt;/ref&gt; for more info on "gradual liberation".}}
{{quote|‘Some people,’ he said, 'start off by studying literature in their youth. Then they indulge in the pleasures of the world until they are fed up with them. Next, when they are at an advanced age, they turn to books on Vedanta. They go to a guru and get initiated by him and then start the process of sravana, manana and nididhyasana, which finally culminates in samadhi. This is the normal and standard way of approaching liberation. It is called krama mukti [gradual liberation]. But I was overtaken by akrama mukti [sudden liberation] before I passed through any of the above-mentioned stages.'&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2" /&gt;}}

===Hinduism===
According to David Frawley, "atma-vichara" is the most important practice in the [[Advaita Vedanta]] tradition, predating its popularisation by Ramana Maharshi.&lt;ref group=web name="Frawley"&gt;[http://www.swamij.com/frawley-self-inquiry.htm David Frawley, ''Self-Inquiry and Its Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the eighth limb of [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Patanjali's Yoga Sutras]], which describes the various stages of samadhi. Meditation on "I-am-ness" is a subtle object of meditation in ''[[savikalpa samadhi]]''.{{sfn|Maehle|2007|p=178}} It is also described in the ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'', a syncretic work which may date from the 6th or 7th century CE, and shows influences from [[Yoga]], [[Samkhya]], [[Saiva Siddhanta]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]], especially [[Yogacara]].{{sfn|Chapple|1984|p=xii}}

==Practice==

===Chasing the I===
Ramana taught that by paying close attention to the 'I'-thought, this 'I'-thought will disappear and only "I-I"&lt;ref group=web name="I-I1"&gt;[http://davidgodman.org/rteach/iandii1.shtml David Godman (1991), '''I' and 'I-I' &amp;mdash; A Reader's Query'', The Mountain Path, 1991, pp. 79&amp;ndash;88. Part one]&lt;/ref&gt; or Self-awareness remains. This results in an "effortless awareness of being",&lt;ref name=Self-enquiry /&gt; and by staying with it&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2"&gt;[http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.nl/2008/06/more-on-bhagavans-death-experience.html David Godman (23 June 2008), ''More on Bhagavan's death experience'']&lt;/ref&gt; this "I-I" gradually destroys the vasanas "which cause the 'I'-thought to rise,"&lt;ref name=Self-enquiry /&gt; and finally the 'I'-thought never rises again, which is [[Self-realization]] or [[Moksha|liberation]].&lt;ref name="Self-enquiry"/&gt;

Ramana gave [[upadesa]], "instruction or guidance given to a disciple by his Guru",&lt;ref group=web name="PathGlossary"&gt;[http://benegal.org/ramana_maharshi/books/pos/pos019.html#Upadesa Arthur Osborne, ''Ramana Maharshi and the Path of Self-Knowledge. Glossary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502194248/http://benegal.org/ramana_maharshi/books/pos/pos019.html |date=2 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing to the true Self of the devotees and showing them the truth of it.{{sfn|Zimmer|1948|p=192}} As author and long-time devotee [[David Godman]] explains,
{{quote|Beginners in self-enquiry were advised by Sri Ramana to put their attention on the inner feeling of 'I' and to hold that feeling as long as possible. They would be told that if their attention was distracted by other thoughts they should revert to awareness of the 'I'-thought whenever they became aware that their attention had wandered. He suggested various aids to assist this process – one could ask oneself 'Who am I?’ or 'Where does this I come from?’ — but the ultimate aim was to be continuously aware of the 'I' which assumes that it is responsible for all the activities of the body and the mind.&lt;ref group=web name="beasyouare"&gt;[http://bhagavan-ramana.org/selfenquirytheory.html David Godman, ''Self-Enquiry &amp;mdash; Theory''. From: "Be As You Are: The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Self-enquiry can be practised at all times: 
{{quote|Self-enquiry should not be regarded as a meditation practice that takes place at certain hours and in certain positions; it should continue throughout one's waking hours, irrespective of what one is doing. Sri Ramana Maharshi saw no conflict between working and self-enquiry and he maintained that with a little practice it could be done under any circumstances. He did sometimes say that regular periods of formal practice were good for beginners, but he never advocated long periods of sitting meditation and he always showed his disapproval when any of his devotees expressed a desire to give up their mundane activities in favour of a meditative life.&lt;ref group=web name="beasyouare" /&gt;}}

===Self is awareness===
Ramana stated that the Self is awareness: 
{{quote|The Truth is that Self is constant and unintermittent Awareness. The object of enquiry is to find the true nature of the Self as Awareness. Let one practise enquiry so long as separateness is perceived.&lt;ref group=web name="nature"&gt;[http://bhagavan-ramana.org/BAYAnatureoftheSelf.html David Godman, ''The Nature of the Self''. From: Be As You Are: The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi. cHapter 1]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Giving up awareness of not-self leads to pure awareness:
{{quote|You are awareness. Awareness is another name for you. Since you are awareness there is no need to attain or cultivate it. All that you have to do is to give up being aware of other things, that is of the not-self. If one gives up being aware of them then pure awareness alone remains, and that is the Self.&lt;ref group=web name="nature" /&gt;}}

===Textual references===
Ramana's written works contain terse descriptions of self-enquiry. Verse thirty of ''Ulladu Narpadu'':{{refn|group=note|"The ‘Forty [Verses] on That Which Is’, is a Tamil poem that Sri Ramana composed in July and August 1928 when Sri Muruganar asked him to teach us the nature of the reality and the means by which we can attain it." From ''[http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.tw/2009/06/ulladu-narpadu-explanatory-paraphrase.html Ulladu Narpadu – an explanatory paraphrase]''. See also [http://luthar.com/2009/02/08/ulladu-naarpadu/ ''ULLADU NAARPADU (also spelt as Ulladu Narpadu): Comments By Professor V. Krishnamurthy'']}}
{{quote|Questioning 'Who am I?' within one's mind, when one reaches the Heart, the individual 'I' sinks crestfallen, and at once reality manifests itself as 'I-I'. Though it reveals itself thus, it is not the ego 'I' but the perfect being the Self Absolute.&lt;ref group=web name="I-I1" /&gt;}}

Verses nineteen and twenty of ''Upadesa Undiyar''{{refn|group=note|[http://happinessofbeing.blogspot.tw/2009/06/upadesa-undiyar-an-explanatory.html ''Upadesa Undiyar – an explanatory paraphrase'']}} describe the same process in almost identical terms:
{{quote|19. 'Whence does the 'I' arise?' Seek this within. The 'I' then vanishes. This is the pursuit of wisdom.&lt;br&gt;
20. Where the 'I' vanished, there appears an 'I-I' by itself. This is the infinite.&lt;ref group=web name="I-I1" /&gt;}}

Vichara Sangraham (Self-Enquiry):
{{quote|Therefore, leaving the corpse-like body as an actual corpse and remaining without even uttering the word 'I' by mouth, if one now keenly enquires, 'What is it that rises as 'I'? then in the Heart a certain soundless ''sphurana'', 'I-I',{{refn|group=note|David Godman: "Bhagavan frequently used the Sanskrit phrase aham sphurana to indicate the 'I-I' consciousness or experience. Aham means 'I' and sphurana can be translated as 'radiation, emanation, or pulsation'."&lt;ref group=web name="I-I1" /&gt; An extensive account on Ramana's use of the words "Self", "I-I" and "aham sphurana" is given in [http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/iandii1.shtml David Godman (1991), '''I' and 'I-I' – A Reader's Query''. The Mountain Path, 1991, pp. 79–88. Part one].}} will shine forth of its own accord. It is an awareness that is single and undivided, the thoughts which are many and divided having disappeared. If one remains still without leaving it, even the sphurana – having completely annihilated the sense of the individuality, the form of the ego, 'I am the body' — will itself in the end subside, just like the flame that catches the camphor. This alone is said to be liberation by great ones and scriptures.&lt;ref group=web name="I-I1" /&gt;}}

==Transcription of Ramana's explanations==
Early on, Ramana attracted devotees who would sit in his company, and ask him questions. Several devotees recorded the answers to their own specific questions, or kept the sheets of paper on which Ramana answered, and had them later published.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=78}} Other devotees recorded the talks between Ramana and devotees, a large amount of which have also been published.&lt;ref group=web name="beasyouare" /&gt;

Ramana "never felt moved to formulate his teaching of his own accord, either verbally or in writing".{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=78}} The few writings he's credited with "came into being as answers to questions asked by his disciples or through their urging".{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=78}} Only a few hymns were written on his own initiative.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=78}}

Ramana's earliest teachings are documented in the book ''Nan Yar?''(Who am I?), in which he elaborates on the "I" and Self-enquiry. The original book was first written in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and published by Sri Pillai.{{sfn|Ramana Maharshi|1982}} The essay version of the book (''Sri Ramana Nutrirattu'') prepared by Ramana is considered definitive, as unlike the original it had the benefit of his revision and review. "''Nan Yar''" was documented by his disciple M. Sivaprakasam Pillai, who was already heavily influenced by traditional Advaita, and so had added notes about the traditional Advaitic negation method for his own clarification; these additional notes were later removed by Ramana.{{sfn|Sadhu Om|2005-A|p=147}} A careful translation with notes is available in English as 'The Path of Sri Ramana, Part One' by Sri Sadhu Om, one of the direct disciples of Ramana.{{sfn|Sri Sadhu Om|2005-A}} There is also an edition by Open Sky Press, [http://www.openskypress.com/enshop/product_info.php?info=p344_nan-yar---who-am-i-.html Nan Yar - Who Am I?] with the original text of ''Nan Yar'' set to quotes and digitally remastered photographs of Sri Ramana Maharshi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3439">The '''semantic view of theories''' is a position in the [[philosophy of science]] that holds that a scientific theory can be identified with a collection of [[model theory|models]].  The semantic view of theories was originally proposed by [[Patrick Suppes]] in “A Comparison of the Meaning and Uses of Models in Mathematics and the Empirical Sciences”&lt;ref&gt;Suppes, P. (1960), “A Comparison of the Meaning and Uses of Models in Mathematics and the Empirical Sciences,” Synthese 12: 287-301.&lt;/ref&gt; as a reaction against the [[received view of theories]] popular among the [[Logical positivism| logical positivists]].  Many varieties of the semantic view propose identifying theories with a class of set-theoretic models in the [[Alfred Tarski|Tarskian]] sense,&lt;ref&gt;Suppes, P. (1960) and da Costa, Newton C. A., and Steven French (1990), “The Model-Theoretic Approach in the Philosophy of Science”, Philosophy of Science 57: 248–265. &lt;/ref&gt; while others specify models in the mathematical language stipulated by the field of which the theory is a member.&lt;ref&gt;van Fraassen, Bas C. (1980), The Scientific Image. Oxford: Clarendon. and Suppe, Frederick (1989), The Semantic Conception of Theories and Scientific Realism. Urbana: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic vs. syntactic views of theories==

The semantic view is typically contrasted with the '''syntactic view of theories''' of the logical positivists and logical empiricists, especially [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]]. On the contrast between syntactic and semantic views,  [[Bas van Fraassen]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The syntactic picture of a theory identifies it with a body of theorems, stated in one particular language chosen for the expression of that theory. This should be contrasted with the alternative of presenting a theory in the first instance by identifying a class of structures as its models. In this second, semantic, approach the language used to express the theory is neither basic nor unique; the same class of structures could well be described in radically different ways, each with its own limitations. The models occupy central stage.&lt;ref&gt;van Fraassen B. 1980. ''The Scientific Image''. Oxford University Press, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this same book, van Fraassen, a key founder of the semantic view of theories, critiques the syntactic view in very strong terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps the worst consequence of the syntactic approach was the way it focused attention on philosophically irrelevant technical questions.  It is hard not to conclude that those discussions of axiomatizability in restricted vocabularies, 'theoretical terms', Craig’s theorem, 'reduction sentences', 'empirical languages', Ramsey and Carnap sentences, were one and all off the mark—solutions to purely self-generated problems, and philosophically irrelevant. (p. 56)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The semantic view of theories has been extended to other domains, including population genetics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elisabeth Lloyd|Lloyd, EA]]. 1994. ''The Structure and Confirmation of Evolutionary Theory. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sentiocentrism''' or '''sentio-centrism''' describes the philosophy that [[sentience|sentient]] individuals (i.e., basically conscious beings) are the center of moral concern. The philosophy posits that all and only sentient beings have [[Intrinsic value (animal ethics)|intrinsic value]] and moral standing, thus moral patients; while the rest of the natural world has [[instrumental value]]. Both humans and other sentient animals have rights and/or interests that must be considered.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sociallearning.info/storage/pdf/encyc%20of%20anim%20welfare%20-%20enrichment%20and%20research.pdf|title=Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare|editors=Marc Bekoff and Carron A. Meaney|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentiocentrists consider discrimination between sentient beings of different species to be [[speciesism]], an arbitrary discrimination. Coherent sentiocentrist belief respects all sentient beings.

== History of term ==

The utilitarian criterion of moral standing is, therefore, all and only sentient beings (sentiocentrism). The 18th-century philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] compiled Enlightenment beliefs in ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' (second edition, 1823, chapter 17, footnote),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation | author=Bentham, Jeremy |chapter=Chapter XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he included his own reasoning in a comparison between slavery and [[sadistic personality disorder|sadism]] toward animals:
{{quotation|The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor [see Louis XIV's [[Code Noir]]]... What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason, or, perhaps, the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? '''The question is not ''Can they reason?'' nor, ''Can they talk?'' but, ''Can they suffer?'''''}}

[[Peter Singer]], in ''A Utilitarian Defense of Animal Liberation'' (pp. 73–82); [[Tom Regan]], in ''The Radical Egalitarian Case for Animal Rights'' (pp. 82–90) and Warren, in ''A Critique of Regan's Animal Rights Theory'' (pp. 90–97) talk about sentiocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beloit.edu/philo/faculty/tedesco/past/phil224/|title=Philosophy 224: Environmental Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentiocentrism is a term contained in the ''Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare'', edited by [[Marc Bekoff]].&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

== Gradualism ==

In the animal kingdom, there is a gradation in the nervous complexity,&lt;ref name="en.wikipedia.org"&gt;[[List of animals by number of neurons]]&lt;/ref&gt; taking examples from the marine sponges that lack neurons, intestinal worms with ~ 300 neurons or humans with ~ 86 billion. While the existence of neurons is not sufficient to demonstrate the existence of sentience in an animal, it is a necessary condition{{Citation needed|reason=Panpsychists, would disagree with this.  David Chalmers notably, entertains the idea that a thermostaat or even an electron may have some degree of subjective experience. |date=November 2018}}, without neurons there is no place where it can happen (and the fewer the neurons, the lower the maximum capacity of intelligence an organism).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Gradualist sentiocentrism states that more complex interests deserve more consideration than less complex moral interests. One implication of this premise is that the best interests of a simple organism does not deserve consideration before the non-best interest in a complex organism (e.g., a dog with intestinal worms should be healed even though this results in the death of the parasites). Note that this does not lead to the rejection of interests of complex animals (such as pigs) versus the human desire to feed on them.

This is a vision that expands to areas that are not only relevant to other species, but uniquely to human issues, as is the case on the legalization of abortion. Gradualism poses a greater consideration of the mother against the fetus in question, given that the latter does not have the ability to own even remotely complex (at least in the early stages of gestation) interests. An emblematic case in this debate is the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], who says that "a human embryo in early stage, without nervous system and presumably lacking pain and fear, could justifiably be afforded less moral protection than an adult pig, which it is clearly well equipped to suffer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25366|title=Edge.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shashibhusan Dasgupta''', or '''Shashi Bhushan Dasgupta''', '''Shashibhusan''' and '''Shashi Bhusan Das Gupta''' (1911–1964) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] scholar of philosophy, languages, literature (particularly Bengali literature), literary critic, author and theologian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sbufind.library.stonybrook.edu/vufind/Author/Home?author=Dasgupta%2C%20Shashi%20Bhushan%2C%201912-1964 "Shashi Bhushan Dasgupta"]. Stonybrook.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dasgupta was born in [[Chandrahar]] Village in  modern [[Barisal Division]], South-Central Bangladesh. He obtained his IA from [[B M College]], Barisal, his BA (Hons) in Philosophy from [[Scottish Church College]], [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. His MA in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] Language and Literature was from [[Calcutta University]] in 1935, and he subsequently joined Calcutta University's Bengali Department as a Researcher. Winning the 1937 [[Premchand Roychand]] Studentship due to his scholarship contributions, Dasgupta was appointed in Bengali Department a lecturer, and received his PhD in that department in 1939.

Dasgupta's chief opus is the identification of Indian spiritual meditation forms and demonstration of their relationship to [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] [[Buddhism]], to [[Saivite]], [[Sakta]] and [[Vaishnava]] religious philosophies, and to Bengali literature. He won the 1961 [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] for his work "[[Bharater Shakti-Sadhana O Shakta Sahitya]]."

Dasgupta had authored novels, plays, poems and children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof. Sirajul Islam |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dasgupta,_Shashibhusan |title=Mahbubul Haque, Banglapedia, National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |publisher=Banglapedia.org |date=1964-07-21 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some editions of his works are published posthumously or in recently updated versions, and their exact or cited titles in English depend on the language variants being transliterated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3634">'''''Shmashana Adhipati''''' is a name given to a deity either male or female and also together as a consort, who rules [[smashan]]. The Shamashana Adhiapati literally translates to Lord of [[Shmashana]]. The name ''Shmashan Adhipathi'' is given to different deities in [[Hinduism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

==In Hinduism==

As per [[Hindu]] scripts Lord [[Shiva]] is considered to be lord of [[Shmashana]] or ''Shmashana Adhipati''. One epithet for Shiva is "inhabitant of the cremation ground" (Sanskrit: śmaśānavāsin, also spelled Shmashanavasin), referring to this connection.&lt;ref&gt;Chidbhavananda, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Kali]], his consort is known by another name '''''Shmashama Kali'''''. Kali's association with blackness stands in contrast to her consort, Shiva, whose body is covered by the white ashes of the cremation ground ([[Sanskrit]]: śmaśāna) in which he meditates, and with which Kali is also associated, as śmaśāna-kālī.[[Kali|Shmashana Kali]]
is also a protector.She can be used to chase away bad spirits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/shakti-sadhana/207648-shmashana-kali.html] Shamshana Kali&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, together Shiva and Kali are they deity associated with Shamshana as per Hindu religion are called Shmashana Adhipati. Also [[Bhairava]], another manifestation of [[Shiva]] and his consort [[Bhairavi]] are said to live in Shamshana. Also the famous [[Mahavidya]] of Hindu and Tantric cult are said to rule over Smashan.

==In Tantric cult==

In [[Tantra|Tantrik]] cult, [[Shmashana]], emerged to be a main area of their experiments called [[Shava sadhana]].&lt;ref&gt;Sacred to profane: Anjum Katyal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logic in a popular form:essays on popular religion in Bengal by Sumanta Banerjee&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aghori]]s and [[Kapalika]] are some of the people who indulge in such rituals in Shamshana. They invoke  [[Kali]], [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]], [[Yogini]], [[Chausath Jogini Temple|Chausath Yogini]], [[Dakini]], [[Bhairava]], [[Bhairavi]] and ghosts like [[Vetala]], [[Pishacha]], [[Brahm Rakshas|Brahm-Rakshasha]] and worship them, give them sacrifices in Shamshana to have occult powers. They consider these deities as '''''Shmashana Adhipati'''''.

==In Tibetan Buddhism==

Further, as per [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] script a couple known as ''Shmashana Adhipati'' ([[Standard Tibetan]]: pal dur tro dag po yab yum. English: the Glorious Lords of the Charnel Ground - Father-Mother) also called ''[[Chitipati]]'' is considered lord of Shamshana. They arise from the ''Secret Essence Wheel Tantra'' and is associated with the collection/cycle of [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra]]. Primarily employed as a wealth practice, with emphasis on protecting from thieves, they also serve as the special protector for the [[Vajrayogini]] 'Naro Khechari' practice. Shri Shmashana Adhipati is now common, to a greater or lesser extent, in all the New (Sarma) Schools of Himalayan and Tibetan influenced Buddhism. It is important not to confuse the protector deities Shri Shmashana Adhipati, Father &amp; Mother, with the skeleton dancers found in the various systems of Tibetan religious Cham dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayanart.org/search/set.cfm?setID=160 Buddhist Protector: Shmashana Adhipati (Chitipati)]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Chitipati''  again has its origin from word ''Chita'' (funeral [[pyre]] as per [[Hindu]] rites). 

[[Dakini]], [[Shakini]] and some other [[Tantra|tantric]] deities, associated both with [[Hinduism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], are said to roam in [[Shmashana]].

The document derived some of its material from the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]], the [[American Automobile Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Thou Shalt Not Be a Tailgating Jerk and Other Holy Thoughts | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=https://select.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/nyregion/24towns.html&amp;OQ=_rQ3D1&amp;OP=6c056087Q2FQ2AanEQ2ApYV11pQ2A7eeuQ2AeJQ2A7gQ2AD5Vn9Q2F1DQ2A7gp1aDYmQ7BpjP | publisher = New York Times | date = 2007-06-24|accessdate = 2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and statements by Popes [[Pius XII]], [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]], [[Paul VI]] and [[John Paul II]].&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news | title = Vatican Tells Motorists: Thou Shalt Drive Carefully | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/22/AR2007062201732.html | publisher = Washington Post | date = 2007-06-23|accessdate = 2007-06-27 | first=Francis X. | last=Rocca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its issue this document received a lot of media attention due to its listing of [[Ten Commandments]] for Drivers.  In essence, the Vatican is pointing out that the act of driving has a moral and ethical component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Vatican Issues 10 Commandments for Drivers: Don't Drink, Don't Kill and Pray | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,284297,00.html | publisher = Fox News | date = 2007-06-19|accessdate = 2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guidelines make note of both the benefits of the use of automobiles as well as its dangerous and negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vatican Calls for Ten Commandments of Driving |url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/women/541 |publisher=Edmunds |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2007-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192610/http://blogs.edmunds.com/women/541 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is not as pervasive in the [[Vatican City]] itself, which has a speed limit of 30&amp;nbsp;km/h (18-19&amp;nbsp;mph) and approximately only 1000 cars;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Vatican Issues 10 Commandments for good motorists| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSL1937441220070619?pageNumber=2 | publisher = Reuters | date = 2007-06-19|accessdate = 2007-06-23}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there were over 35 million deaths resulting from car accidents in the 20th century,&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt; and the Vatican is responding. In the same section of the document as the Drivers' Ten Commandments are the so-called Christian virtues of drivers, which include prudence, justice and hope.

The Guidelines not only deal with problems on the road, but also address prostitution, caring for street children and the homeless, found in Parts Two, Three and Four of the Guidelines.&lt;ref name="212.77.1.245"/&gt;

The Guidelines state that driving can bring out primitive behavior in drivers, which leads to road rage, rude gestures, speeding, drinking behind the wheel, cursing, blasphemy, impoliteness, and intentional violation of the highway code.  The Guidelines encourage drivers to obey the highway code, pray behind the wheel and recite the [[rosary]], which the Guidelines insist would not distract the driver's attention.

The '''three-source hypothesis''' is a candidate solution to the [[synoptic problem]]. It combines aspects of the [[two-source hypothesis]] and the [[Farrer hypothesis]]. It states that the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]] used the [[Gospel of Mark]] and a sayings collection as primary sources, but that the Gospel of Luke also used Gospel of Matthew as a subsidiary source. The hypothesis is named after the three documents it posits as sources, namely the sayings collection, the Gospel of Mark, and the Gospel of Matthew.

The sayings collection may be identified with Q-lite, and some (typically narrative-related) material normally assigned to Q may instead be attributed to Luke's use of Matthew.

This theory has been advocated by

[[File:Sun Deng.jpg|thumb|Sun Deng playing the [[Duxianqin|one-stringed zither]] in his mountain cave]]
'''''Chángxiào''''' 長嘯 or '''transcendental whistling''' was an ancient [[Daoist]] technique of long-drawn, resounding [[whistling]] that functioned as a [[yogic]] or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] exercise. A skillful whistler could supposedly summon animals, communicate with supernatural beings, and control weather phenomena. Transcendental whistling is a common theme in [[Chinese literature]], for instance Chenggong Sui's (3rd century) ''Xiaofu'' 嘯賦 "Rhapsody on Whistling" and [[Ge Fei (author)|Ge Fei]] 's (1989) ''Hūshào'' 忽哨 "Whistling" short story. The most famous transcendental whistlers lived during the 3rd century, including the last master [[Sun Deng (recluse)|Sun Deng]], and two of the eccentric [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]], [[Ruan Ji]] and [[Ji Kang]], all of whom were also talented zitherists.

==Terminology==
The [[Chinese language]] has two common words meaning "to whistle": ''xiào'' [[wikt:嘯|嘯]] or [[wikt:啸|啸]] "whistle; howl; roar; wail" and ''shào'' [[wikt:哨|哨]] "warble; chirp; whistle; sentry". [[Word usage]] of ''xiào'' 嘯 (first occurring in the c. 10th century BCE ''Shijing'', below) is historically older than ''shào'' 哨 (first in the c. 2nd century BCE ''[[Liji]]'' describing a [[pitch-pot]]'s "wry mouth", tr. Legge 1885: 397). Both [[Chinese characters]] are written with the [[Radical 30|mouth radical]] [[wikt:口|口]] and phonetic indicators of ''sù'' [[wikt:肅|肅]] "shrivel; contract" and ''xiāo'' [[wikt:肖|肖]] "like; similar". The 16-[[Stroke (CJKV character)|stroke]] character 嘯 has graphically simpler versions of 14-stroke [[wikt:嘨|嘨]] and 11-stroke [[wikt:啸|啸]], and an ancient [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] ''xiao'' [[wikt:歗|歗]] (with the [[Radical 76|yawn radical]] 欠).

===Xiao===
The [[etymology]] of [[Old Chinese]] *''siûh'' 嘯 "to whistle: to croon" is [[Sound symbolism|sound symbolic]], with [[cognates]] of [[Proto-Tibeto-Burman language]] *''hyu'' or *''huy'' "whistle" and [[Chepang language]] ''syu-'' "blow through (hand, etc.)" (Schuessler 2007: 422).

This same [[onomatopoeic]] and semantic ''sù'' &lt; *''siuk'' 肅 "shrivel; contract" element is also used to write ''xiāo'' [[wikt:簫|簫]] "bamboo flute" (with the [[Radical 118|bamboo radical]] ⺮), ''xiāoxiāo'' [[wikt:蕭蕭|蕭蕭]] "rustling sound (of falling leaves); whistling (of wind); whinnying (of horses)" (with the [[Radical 140|plant radical]] 艹), and ''xiāoxiāo'' 瀟瀟 "whistling (of wind) and pattering (of rain)" (with the [[Radical 85|water radical]] 氵).

The (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' dictionary uses ''chuī'' 吟 "blow; puff; play (a wind instrument)" to explicate ''xiao''; defining ''xiao'' 嘯 as 吹聲也 "to make sound by blowing", and ''xiao'' 歗 as 吟也 "to blow" (citing the ''Shijing'' 22, below).

The [[semantic field]] of ''xiào'' in [[Modern Standard Chinese]] includes human whistling and singing (for instance, ''xiàojiào'' 嘯叫 "whistle", ''yínxiào'' 吟嘯 "sing in freedom; lament; sigh", ''xiàogē'' 嘯歌 "sing at full voice"), whistling sounds (''hūxiào'' 呼嘯 "whistle; scream; whiz (arrow)", ''xiàoshēng'' 嘯聲 "whistle; squeak; squeal; howl", ''hǎixiào'' 海嘯 "tsunami; tidal wave"), [[animal sounds]] (''hǔxiào'' 虎嘯 "tiger's roar", ''yuánxiào'' 猿嘯 "monkey's cry", ''xiàodiāo'' 嘯雕 "[[whistling kite]]"), Daoistic [[counterculture]] (''xiào'ào'' 嘯傲 "be forthright in speech and action; be leisurely and carefree", ''xiào'àoshānquán'' 嘯傲山泉 "lead a hermit's life in the woods and by a stream", ''xiàojù shānlín'' 嘯聚山林 "form a band and take to the forests"), and the present Daoist transcendental whistling (''chángxiào'' 長嘯 "utter a long and loud cry; whistle", ''yǎngtiānchángxiào'' 仰天長嘯 "cry out at length to heaven; make a long throaty noise in the open air"). Donald Holzman (2009: 151) says ''xiao'' "has a distracting range of meanings, clustered around the basic idea of 'producing sound through puckered lips', from the lion's roar to a man's whistling, passing through vocalization, chanting or wailing."

The ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' unabridged [[Chinese dictionary]] defines two meanings for ''chángxiào'' 长啸 or 長嘯: 大声呼叫，发出高而长的声音 "Call out in a loud voice, issue a long, high-pitched sound", and 撮口发出悠长清越的声音 "Protrude the lips and issue a long, drawn-out, clear, and far-carrying sound".

While the [[English lexicon]] has diverse whistling vocabulary, such as [[whistled language]] and [[whistle register]], it lacks a standard translation equivalent for Chinese ''changxiao'', literally "long whistle/whistling". Direct translations fail to denote the word's supernatural aspects: "whistling without a break" (Giles 1948), "long whistle" (Kroll 1983), "prolonged whistle" (Egan 1994), and "long piercing whistle" (Hegel 1998). Explanatory translations are more meaningful to English readers; the commonly used "transcendental whistling" was coined by [[Victor Mair]] (1996, 1998) and adopted by other authors (e.g., Minford 2014—''and'' many famous whistlers were ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "transcendents"). Some less common renderings are "cosmic 'whistling'" (Chan 1996), "Taoist mediative [sic] whistle" (Hegel 1998), and "cosmic whistle" (Varsano 1999).

===Shao===
The semantic field of ''shào'' includes whistling sounds and [[whistle]] instruments (for instance, ''hūshào'' 呼/忽/唿哨 "to whistle", ''húshào'' 胡哨 "a whistle signal", ''kǒushào(r)'' 口哨 "a whistle (instrument and sound)", ''shàozi'' 哨子 "a whistle"), birds (''niǎoshào'' 鳥哨 "birdcall", ''shàoyīng'' 哨鷹 "[[chanting goshawk]]", ''gēshào'' 鴿哨 "whistle tied to a pigeon"), and (whistle-signaling) guards (''shàobīng'' 哨兵 "sentinel; sentry; guard", ''fàngshào'' 放哨 "to stand sentry", ''liàowàngshào'' 瞭望哨 "watchtower; lookout post").

The common "whistle" term ''hūshào'' (for which ''hū'' can be written 呼 "exhale; shout", 忽 "disdainful; sudden", or 唿 "sad") refers to a type of shrill, forceful [[finger whistling]] that is often mentioned in traditional Chinese short stories and novels of the Ming and Qing periods as a kind of remote signaling or calling (Mair 1998:43).

==Textual examples==
The [[Chinese classics]] provide a means of tracing the semantic developments of ''xiao'' from "wail", to "call back", to "whistle". The earliest usages in the [[Western Zhou]] dynasty (1046–771 BCE) ''[[Shijing]]'' "Classic of Poetry" described the sound of women expressing high emotion or grief. The [[Warring States period]] (c. 475 – 221 BCE) ''[[Chuci]]'' "Songs of the South" used ''xiao'' and ''changxiao'' to mean a piercing whistle or call to summon back the spirit or a recently deceased person. The (1st century BCE) ''[[Liexian Zhuan]]'' "Collected Biographies of Transcendents" first associated transcendental whistling with Daoism, as represented by the Madman of Chu who mocked Confucius.

During the [[Eastern Han]] (25–220 CE) and [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] (265–420) ''xiao'' and ''changxiao'' whistling became especially associated with Daoism. For example, the ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'' (82, tr. DeWoskin 1983: 77) biography of Xu Deng 徐登 mentions his companion Zhao Bing 趙柄 whistling to call up wind. "On another occasion, he was seeking passage across a river, but the boat man would not take him. [Bing] spread out a cloth and sat in the middle of it. Then with a long whistle he stirred up winds [長肅呼風] and whipped up wild currents which carried him across."

Later texts associated ''(chang)xiao'' transcendental whistling with Daoist inner-breath yoga techniques and ''[[qi]]''-circulation. Daoist meditation and healing use a breathing technique called ''Liuqi fa'' 六氣法 "Method of the Six Breaths" that is practiced in various ways. The Six Breaths are ''si'' 嘶 "hissing with the lips wide and teeth together", ''he'' 呵 "guttural rasping with mouth wide open", ''hu'' 呼 "blowing out the breath with rounded lips", ''xu'' 嘘 "gently whistling with pursed lips", ''chui'' 吹 "sharply expelling the air with the lips almost closed", and ''xi'' 嘻 "sighing with mouth slightly open" (Kohn 2012: 233).

Su (2006: 29, 32) calls the [[Six Dynasties]] (222-589) the "[[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of whistling". ''Xiao'' seems to have permeated all strata of Six Dynasties society, and practitioners included persons from almost all walks of life: recluses, hermit-scholars, generals, Buddhist monks, non-Chinese foreigners, women, high society elite, and Daoist priests. "In general, poets, hermits, and people of all types in the Six Dynasties utilized whistling to express a sense of untrammeled individual freedom, or an attitude of disobedience to authority or traditional ceremony, or to dispel suppressed feelings and indignation."

Ancient superstitions about whistling continue in [[Chinese folklore]]. In the present day, some [[Han Chinese]] consider it taboo to whistle in the house at night for fear of provoking ghosts, and similarly, the minority [[Maonan people]] and [[Kam people]] (mostly in [[South Central China]]) believe that whistling while working in the fields will invoke demons to damage the harvest (Su 2006: 28).

===Shijing===
The earliest recorded textual usage of ''xiao'' 嘯 or 歗 meant "wail" not "whistle". Three (c. 10th-7th century BCE) ''Shijing'' "Classic of Poetry" odes use ''xiao'' to describe heartbroken women expressing sadness. Since the ancient, lyrical language of the ''Shijing'' can be difficult to interpret, the English translations of [[James Legge]] (1976), [[Arthur Waley]] (1937), and [[Bernhard Karlgren]] (1950) are cited.

Two odes use ''xiao'' 嘯 along with ''gē'' 歌 "sing; song". 
Ode 22 江有汜 "The [[Yangzi]] Splits and Joins" is interpreted as concubines who were not allowed to accompany their bride to her new home, [江有沱]之子歸不我過 不我過其嘯也歌, translated as:
*Our lady, when she was married, would not come near us; Would not come near us, but she blew that feeling away, and sang. (Legge 1876: 33)
*Our lady that went to be married, Did not move us with her. She did not move us with her, But in the end she has let us come. (Waley 1937: 74)
*This young lady went to her new home, but she would not pass us on; She would not pass us on, but (now) crooningly she sings. (Karlgren 1950: 13)
Waley says the last words "are certainly corrupt" and suggests 宿也可 "allow to lodge". Karlgren explains "She can do nothing but croon (wail) and resign herself to it."

Ode 229 "White Flowers" uses ''xiaoge'' to describe a wife whose husband is gone, 嘯歌傷懷念彼碩人:
*I whistle and sing with wounded heart thinking of that great man. (Legge 1876)
*Full of woe is this song I chant, Thinking of that tall man. (Waley 1937: 103)
* I (crooningly) wailingly sing with pained bosom, I am thinking of that tall man. (Karlgren 1950: 182)
These translators agree that ''ge'' means "sing; song" but differ over whether ''xiao'' means "whistle", "chant", and "croon; wail".

Ode 69 "In the Midst of the Valley are [[Motherwort]]s" uses the graphic variant ''xiao'' 歗, interpreted as "groan", "sob", or "weep", describing another separated couple, 有女仳離條其嘯矣:
*There is a woman forced to leave her husband, Long-drawn are her groanings. (Legge 1876)
*Bitterly she sobs, Faced with man's unkindness. (Waley 1937: 59)
*There is a girl who has been rejected; long-drawn-out is her (crooning:) wailing. (Karlgren 1950: 47)
Based on these ''Shijing'' contexts, (Su 2006: 16) says ''xiao'' means "to whistle" and is related to singing and chanting in general.

[[Bernhard Karlgren]]'s (1964: 104-105) detailed ''Shijing'' gloss concludes ''xiao'' means "wail; groan" instead of "whistle". The Han version commentary says ''xiao'' means 歌無章曲 "to sing without stanzas or (fixed) melody, i.e., "to croon", thus "When she croons she sings" = "crooningly she sings"; [[Zheng Xuan]]'s commentary to the Mao version says it means 蹙口而出聲 "to compress the mouth and emit a sound", i.e., "to whistle", "When she whistles she sings (=) she whistles and sings". [[Zhu Xi]] says ''xiaohu'' 嘯呼 means ''sù'' or ''sòu'' 嗖 "wail; whiz". Karlgren notes that ''xiao'' can mean either "to whistle" or "to croon; to wail"; citing the ''Liji'' 不嘯不指 "He does not whistle, nor point with the finger" and ''Huainanzi'' 黃神嘯吟 "The yellow spirit wails and moans".

Like the ''Shijing'', Han and [[Six Dynasties]] texts frequently associated whistling with women expressing their sorrows. The ''[[Lienu zhuan]]'' "Biographies of Exemplary Women" (Su 2006: 17) has a story about a secretly wise "Girl from Qishi 漆室 in [[Lu (state)|Lu]]" (modern [[Zoucheng]], [[Shandong]]). The girl was leaning against a pillar and whistling [倚柱而嘯]. Her neighbor heard and asked if she was whistling sadly because she longed for a husband, which the neighbor offered to arrange. The girl answered that she was not worried about getting a husband, but was worried because the ruler of Lu was old and but the crown prince was still too young. As the girl feared, Lu fell into chaos and was invaded by neighboring states.

===Chuci===
The (c. 3rd century BCE-2nd century CE) ''[[Chuci]]'' "Songs of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]" uses ''xiao'' to mean "call back (a dead person's soul)", monkey and tiger "calls; roars", and "whistle; call out".

The earliest textual example of ''xiao'' meaning "to summon a spirit" is in the ''[[Zhao Hun|Zhaohun]]'' "Summons of the Soul", which describes a shamanistic ritual to resuscitate a recently deceased person by calling back their ''[[Hun and po|hun]]'' "spiritual soul that leaves the body after death", as opposed to their ''po'' "corporal soul that remains with the deceased corpse". This poem uses the compound ''xiàohū'' 嘯呼 with "shout; call"
&lt;blockquote&gt;O soul, come back! And enter the gate of the city. Skilled priests are there who call you, walking backwards to lead you in. Qin basket-work, silk cords of Qi, and silken banners of Zheng: All things are there proper for your recall; and with long-drawn, piercing cries they summon the wandering soul [永嘯呼些]. O soul, come back! Return to your old abode. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 105) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Wang Yi (librarian)|Wang Yi]]’s commentary invokes [[yin and yang]] theory. "''Xiao'' has ''yin'' characteristics, and ''hu'' has ''yang'' characteristics. ''Yang'' governs the ''hun'' spiritual soul, and ''yin'' governs the ''po'' animal soul. Thus, in order to summon the whole being, one must ''xiaohu''. Karlgren (1964: 104-105) translates "Long-drawn I (croon:) wail". David Hawkes (1986: 219-220) notes that the ''[[Etiquette and Ceremonial|Yili]]'' ritual handbook section on ''zhaohun'' "soul-summoning" does not mention the shamanistic ''xiao'' "whistling" found in the ''Chuci'', and suggests that the Confucian ritualist who compiled the text "evidently did not expect this somewhat perfunctory soul-summoning to be successful." The ''Yili'' says the soul-summoner should take a suit of clothing formerly worn by the deceased, climb a ladder to the roof, stretch out the clothes, get up on the roof ridge, and "call out three times in a loud voice, 'Ho, ''Such a One''! Come back!" Then he hands the clothing down to an assistant, who puts it on the corpse for viewing, and then the summoner climbs back down.

''[[Summons for a Recluse|Zhaoyinshi]]'' "Summons for a Recluse" uses ''xiao'' describing the calls of ''[[Monkeys in Chinese culture#Yuan and Naoyuan|yuanyou]]'' 猿狖 "gibbons".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The cassia trees grow thick In the mountain's recesses, Their branches interlacing. The mountain mists are high, The rocks are steep. In the sheer ravines The waters' waves run deep. Monkeys in chorus cry; Tigers and leopards roar [猿狖群嘯兮虎豹原]. One has climbed up by the cassia boughs Who wishes to tarry there. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 244) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Miujian'' "Reckless Remonstrance" uses ''xiao'' for a tiger's "roar", among examples of ''[[ganying]]'' "correlative resonance".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like sounds harmonize together; Creatures mate with their own kind. The flying bird cries out to the flock; The deer calls, searching for his friends. If you strike ''gong'', then ''gong'' responds; If you hit ''jue'', then ''jue'' vibrates. The tiger roars, and the wind of the valley comes [虎嘯而谷風至兮]; The dragon soars, and the radiant clouds come flying. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 257) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Sigu'' "Sighing for Olden Times", which is attributed to the ''Chuci'' editor [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]], uses ''xiao'' meaning "whistle; call out". 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I think how my homeland has been brought to ruin, And the ghosts of my ancestors robbed of their proper service. I grieve that the line of my father's house is broken; My heart is dismayed and laments within me. I shall wander a while upon the sides of the mountain, And walk about upon the river's banks. I shall look down, whistling, on the deep waters [臨深水而長嘯兮], Wander far and wide, looking all about me. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 298) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Huainanzi===
[[Liu An]]'s (c. 139 BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]'' "Masters of Huainan", which is a compendium of writings from various schools of Chinese philosophy, has two ''xiao'' "howl; wail; moan" usages, which clearly exclude "whistle" (Karlgren 1964: 105).

The "Celestial Patterns" chapter uses ''xiao'' "roar" in a context giving examples of ''yin''-''yang'' ''[[ganying]]'' resonance, including the [[Chinese sun and moon mirrors]] ''yangsui'' 陽燧 "burning mirror" and ''fangzhu'' 方諸 "square receptacle".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fire flies upward; water flows downward. Thus, the flight of birds is aloft; the movement of fishes is downward. Things within the same class mutually move one another; root and twig mutually respond to each other. Therefore, when the burning mirror sees the sun, it ignites tinder and produces fire. When the square receptacle sees the moon, it moistens and produces water. When the tiger roars, the valley winds rush [虎嘯而穀風至]; when the dragon arises, the bright clouds accumulate. When ''qilins'' wrangle, the sun or moon is eclipsed; when the leviathan dies, comets appear. When silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the ''shang'' string [of a stringed instrument] snaps. When meteors fall, the Bohai surges upward. (3.2, tr. Major et al. 2010: 116) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Huainanzi'' "Surveying Obscurities" chapter uses ''xiao'' "moan" referring to people suffering under the legendary tyrant [[Jie of Xia]].
&lt;blockquote&gt; Beauties messed up their hair and blackened their faces, spoiling their appearance. Those with fine voices filled their mouths with charcoal, kept their [talent] shut away, and did not sing. Mourners did not [express] the fullness of grief; hunters did not obtain any joy [from it]. The Western Elder snapped her hair ornament; the Yellow God sighed and moaned [黃神嘯吟]. (6., tr. Major et al. 2010: 227) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The honorific names ''Xilao'' 西老 "Western Elder" and ''Huangshen'' 黃神 "Yellow God" refer to the [[Queen Mother of the West]] and [[Yellow Emperor]].

===Liexian zhuan===
The [[Daoist]] ''[[Liexian Zhuan]]'' "Collected Biographies of Transcendents", edited by [[Liu Xiang (author)|Liu Xiang]] (c. 79-8 BCE), uses ''changxiao'' in the [[hagiography]] of Lu Tong 陸通 (better known as Lu Jieyu, or Jie Yu 接輿, the madman of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]).

The story of Lu Jieyu meeting Confucius (551-479 BCE) is well known. The first version is in the Confucian ''[[Lunyu]]''. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chieh Yü, the madman of Ch'u, came past Master K'ung, singing as he went: "Oh phoenix, phoenix How dwindled is your power! As to the past, reproof is idle, But the future may yet be remedied. Desist, desist! Great in these days is the peril of those who fill office." Master K'ung got down [from his carriage], desiring to speak with him; but the madman hastened his step and got away, so that Master K'ung did not succeed in speaking with him. (tr. Waley 1938: 219) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Daoist ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' gives an anti-Confucian version.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When Confucius went to Ch'u, Chieh Yü, the madman of Ch'u, wandered about before his gate, saying:
"Phoenix! Oh, Phoenix! How your virtue has declined! The future you cannot wait for, The past you cannot pursue. When the Way prevails under heaven, The Sage seeks for accomplishment; When the Way is absent from the world, The sage seeks but to preserve his life. In an age like that of today, All he can hope for is to avoid punishment. …" (tr. Mair 1994: 40-41)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Liexian zhuan'' entry about the feigned "madman" says.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lu Tong was the madman of Chu, Jieyu. He loved nourishing life, his food was [[beggartick]]s, [[wax-myrtle]]s, and turnips. Lu traveled to famous mountains, and was sighted over many generations on the peak of [[Mount Emei]], where he lived for several hundred years before departing. Jieyu delighted in talking about nourishing the inner nature and concealing one's brilliance. His custom was to mock Confucius, and proclaim a decline in [the virtue of] the phoenix. He matched breaths with harmony and cherished the abstruse. He strode across lofty mountains, and transcendentally whistled on Mount Emei. [陸通者雲楚狂接輿也 好養生食橐廬木實及蕪菁子 游諸名山在蜀峨嵋山上世世見之歷數百年去 接輿樂道養性潛輝 風諷尼父諭以鳳衰 納氣以和存心以微 高步靈岳長嘯峨嵋]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Xiaofu===
The ''Xiaofu'' 嘯賦 "Rhapsody on Whistling" was written by Chenggong Sui 成公綏 (231-273), a renowned [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] (265-420) author of ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]'' "rhapsody; poetic exposition" rhymed prose. The [[Heian period]] scholar-official [[Sugawara no Kiyotomo]]'s (814) ''[[Ryōunshū]]'' poetry collection includes his Japanese ''Shōfu'' 嘯賦 "Rhapsody on Whistling" (Su 2006: 41).

The (648) ''[[Book of Jin]]'' (92) [https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%99%89%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B7092#.E6.88.90.E5.85.AC.E7.B6.8F biography] of Chenggong Sui is the primary source about his life and writing the prose-poem ''Xiaofu''. Sui, whose [[courtesy name]] was Zi'an 子安, was a native of Boma 白馬 in the Eastern [[Commandery (China)|Commandery]] 東郡 (present day [[Hua County, Henan]]). As a youth, he read widely in the classics, and had a great talent for writing beautiful ''fu''. Sui especially loved [[musical temperament]] [音律]. Once during hot weather, he received instruction/enlightenment from the wind and whistled [承風而嘯], making his tune cool and clear [泠然成曲]. Following this, he composed the ''Hsiao fu'' [… quoting full text]. The poet-official [[Zhang Hua]] regarded Chenggong Sui's writings as peerless and recommended him as an official. Sui served as Chancellor to the [[Nine Ministers#Minister of Ceremonies|Minister of Ceremonies]] and Palace Writer Attendant. He died in 273 at the age of 43.

The Rhapsody on Whistling begins with an idealized recluse who retires from the world with a group of friends to learn Daoist secrets through techniques of transcendental whistling, with which the whistler expresses his disdain toward the vulgar world, and releases his indignation and suffering (Su 2006: 37).
&lt;blockquote&gt;The secluded gentleman, In sympathy with the extraordinary, And in love with the strange, Scorns the world and is unmindful of prestige. He breaks away from human endeavor and leaves it behind. He gazes up at the lofty, longing for the days of old; He ponders lengthily, his thoughts wandering afar. He would Climb Mount Chi, in order to maintain his moral integrity; Or float on the blue sea to wander with his ambition.

So he invites his trusted friends, Gathering about himself a group of like-minded. He gets at the essence of the ultimate secret of life; He researches the subtle mysteries of Tao and Te. He regrets that the common people are not yet enlightened; He alone, transcending all, has prior awakening. He finds constraining the narrow road of the world – He gazes up at the concourse of heaven, and treads the high vastness. Distancing himself from the exquisite and the common, he abandons his personal concerns; Then, filled with noble emotion, he gives a long-drawn whistle [乃慷慨而長嘯].

Thereupon, The dazzling spirit inclines its luminous form, Pouring its brilliance into Vesper's Vale. And his friends, rambling hand in hand, Stumble to a halt, stepping on their toes. He sends forth marvelous tones from his red lips, And stimulates mournful sounds from his gleaming teeth. The sound rises and falls, rolling in his throat. The breath rushes out and is repressed, then flies up like sparks [氣衝鬱而熛起]. He harmonizes [the notes of the Chinese pentatonic scale] 'golden ''kung''' with 'sharp ''chiao'',' Blending ''shang'' and ''yü'' into 'flowing ''chih''.' The whistle floats like a wandering cloud in the grand empyrean, And gathers a great wind for a myriad miles. When the song is finished, and the echoes die out, It leaves behind a pleasure that lingers on in the mind. Indeed, whistling is the most perfect natural music, Which cannot be imitated by strings or woodwinds.

Thus, the Whistler Uses no instrument to play his music, Nor any material borrowed from things. He chooses it from the near-at-hand—his own Self, And with his mind he controls his breath [役心御氣]. (tr. White 1994: 429-430) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this context, Mair (1994: 430) notes that ''shen'' [[wikt:身|身]] "body; person" means "Self" in the sense of [[Daoist meditation]]. "The whistler finds the music and the means of producing it within himself … Everything is available within the Self. The breath and the mind are closely linked. By cultivating the flow of his attention, he simultaneously gains control over the flow of his breath."

The Rhapsody then elaborates on transcendental whistling. It spontaneously harmonizes with the world, "For every category he has a song; To each thing he perceives, he tunes a melody."; "Thus, the Whistler can Create tones based on the forms, Compose melodies in accordance to affairs; Respond without limit to the things of Nature." (tr. White 1994: 430, 432). The marvelous sounds affect both the whistler, "Pure, surpassing both reed and mouth-organ; Richly harmonious with lute and harp. Its mystery is subtle enough to unfold fully pure consciousness and enlighten creative intelligence."; and the listener, "Though you be lost in thoughts, it can bring you back to your Mind; Though you be distressed, it will never break your Heart." (tr. White 1994: 431). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Should he then Imitate gong and drum, or mime clay vessels and gourds; here is a mass of sound like many instruments playing – Like reed pipe and flute of bamboo [''xiao'' 簫] – Bumping boulders trembling, An horrendous crashing, smashing, breaking. Or should he Sound the tone ''chih'', then severe winter becomes steaming hot; Give free play to ''yü'', then a sharp frost makes summer fade; Move into ''shang'', then a long autumn rain appears to fall in springtime; Strike up the tone ''chiao'', then a vernal breeze soughs in the bare branches. (tr. White 1994: 433) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chenggong Sui obviously understood the technical aspects of the [[pentatonic scale]] and the relationship of [[musical note]]s and [[Pitch (music)#Pitch standards and Standard pitch|pitch standards]] (Goodman 2010: 139).

The Rhapsody on Whistling concludes by describing famous musicians, singers, and animals all enthralled by hearing the whistler's performance, and uses ''changxiao'' again, "They understand the magnificent beauty of the long-drawn Whistle [乃知長嘯之奇妙]; Indeed, this is the most perfect of sounds." (tr. White 1994: 434).

This prose-poem has many Daoist elements besides researching "the subtle mysteries of Tao and Te" (above). Transcendental whistling is presented as a powerful method of self-cultivation through [[Qigong|breath control]]. The statement that "with his mind he controls his breath" uses the Daoist term ''yùqì'' 御氣 "control the breath; move ''qi'' through the body", further described as,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [eight] sounds and [five] harmonies constantly fluctuate; The melody follows no strict beat. It runs, but does not run off. It stops, but does not stop up. Following his mouth and lips, he expands forth. Floating on his fragrant breath, he wanders afar [假芳氣而遠逝]. The music is, in essence, subtle with flowing echoes. The sound races impetuously, but with a harsh clarity. Indeed, with its supreme natural beauty, It is quite strange and other-worldly. (tr. White 1994: 434) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Fangqi'' 芳氣 "fragrant breath" is a Daoist metaphor for ''meide'' 美德 "beautiful virtues".

===Shenxian zhuan===
[[Ge Hong]]'s (c. 4th century) Daoist ''[[Shenxian zhuan]]'' "Biographies of Divine Transcendents" has two hagiographies that mention supernatural whistling powers; Liu Gen 劉根 could summon ghosts, and Liu Zheng 劉政 could summon powerful winds.

First, the hagiography of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 CE) ''[[fangshi]]'' Liu Gen 劉根 says he saved himself from punishment by ''changxiao'' whistling to summon the prosecutor's family ghosts who insisted on his freedom. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Liu Gen, styled Jun'an 君安, was a native of the capital at Chang'an. As a youth he understood the Five Classics. During the second year of the ''suihe'' period of Han Emperor Cheng's reign [7 BCE], he was selected as a Filial and lncorrupt and was made a Gentleman of the Interior. Later he left the world behind and practiced the Way. He entered a cave on Mount Songgao that was situated directly above a sheer cliff over fifty thousand feet high. Winter or summer, he wore no clothing. The hair on his body grew one to two feet long. …  Commandant Zhang, the new governor, took Liu Gen to be a fake, and he sent lictors to summon him, plotting to have him killed. … The commandant ordered over fifty men brandishing swords and pikes to tie Liu up and stand him at attention. Liu's face showed no change in color. The commandant interrogated Liu as follows: "So, do you possess any arts of the Dao?" "Yes." "Can you summon ghosts?" "I can." "Since you can," said the commandant, "you will bring ghosts before this chamber bench at once. If you do not, I will have you tortured and killed." Liu replied, "Causing ghosts to appear is quite easy." Liu Gen borrowed a brush and an inkstone and composed a memorial. [In a moment,] a clanging sound like that of bronze or iron could be heard outside, and then came a long whistling sound, extremely plangent [因長嘯嘯音非常清亮]. All who heard it were awestruck [聞者莫不肅然], and the visitors all shook with fear. In another moment, an opening several dozen feet wide appeared in the south wall of the chamber, and four hundred or five hundred armored troops could be seen passing orders down the lines. Several dozen crimson-clad swordsmen then appeared, escorting a carriage straight through the opened wall into the chamber. The opened wall then returned to its former state. Liu Gen ordered the attendants to present the ghosts. With that, the crimson-clad guards flung back the shroud covering the carriage to reveal an old man and an old woman tightly bound inside. They hung their heads before the chamber bench. Upon examining them closely, the commandant saw that they were his deceased father and mother. Shocked and dismayed, he wept and was completely at a loss. The ghosts reprimanded him, saying, "When we were alive, you had not yet attained office, so we received no nourishment from your salary. Now that we are dead, what do you mean by offending a venerable official among divine transcendents and getting us arrested? After causing such a difficulty as this, aren't you ashamed even to stand among other people?" The commandant came down the steps and knocked his head on the ground before Liu Gen, saying that he deserved to die and begging that his ancestors be pardoned and released. Liu ordered the five hundred troops to take out the prisoners and release them. As the carriage moved out, the wall opened back up; then, when it was outside, the wall closed again and the carriage was nowhere to be seen. Liu had also disappeared. (tr. Campany 2002: 240-242) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Robert Ford Campany notes, "The whistlers may be not the ghosts of the departed but the spirit-officials who are ushering them along. Esoteric techniques of whistling numbered among Daoist arts."

In the ''[[History of the Latter Han]]'' version of this story, it is Liu Gen himself who does the ''xiao'' rather than ''changxiao'' whistling. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Liu Gen was a native of Yingchuan. He dwelt in seclusion on Mount Song. Curiosity seekers came from afar to study the Dao with him. The Governor Shi Qi 史祈 took him for a charlatan and had him arrested and brought in to his offices. He questioned him, saying, "What arts do you have, that you mislead and deceive the people so? You will perform a confirmatory feat, or else you will die at once." Liu said, "I truly have no unusual powers, except that I have some small ability to cause people to see ghosts." "Summon one right now," Shi said, "so that I can see it with my own eyes, and only then will I take it as clearly established." At this, Liu Gen looked to the left and whistled [左顧而嘯]. In a moment, Shi's deceased father, along with several dozen of his departed relatives, appeared before them, bound. They knocked their heads on the ground toward Liu and said, "Our son has acted wrongly and should be punished!" Then they turned to Shi Qi and said, "As a descendant, not only do you bring no benefit to your ancestors, but you bring trouble to us departed spirits! Knock your head on the ground and beg forgiveness for us!" Shi Qi, stricken with fear and remorse, knocked his head until it ran blood and begged to take the punishment for his crime himself Liu Gen remained silent and made no reply. Suddenly he [and the ghosts] all vanished. (tr. Campany 2002: 249) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, the hagiography of Liu Zheng 劉政, who lived to an age of more than 180 years, uses ''chuīqì'' 吹氣 "blow one's breath" to mean "whistle up (wind)".
&lt;blockquote&gt; Liu Zheng was a native of Pei. He was highly talented and broadly learned; there was little his studies had not covered. … He lived for more than one hundred eighty years, and his complexion was that of a youth. He could transform himself into other shapes and conceal his form … Further, he was capable of planting fruits of all types and causing them immediately to flower and ripen so as to be ready to eat. He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive, setting out a complete meal for up to several hundred people. His mere whistling could create a wind to set dust swirling and blow stones about [能吹氣為風飛沙揚石]. By pointing his finger he could make a room or a mountain out of a gourd; when he wanted to tear it down, he simply pointed again, and it would become as before. He could transform himself into the form of a beautiful woman. He could create fire and water, travel several thousand ''li'' in a single day, create clouds by breathing over water, and make fog by raising his hands. (tr. Campany 2002: 322-323, cf. DeWoskin 1983: 82-83) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Shishuo xinyu===
The (5th century) ''[[Shishuo Xinyu]]'' version of this whistling story about Ruan Ji visiting the unnamed Sun Deng, referred to as the ''[[zhenren]]'' "perfected person" in the Sumen Mountains 蘇門山.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When Juan Chi whistled [嘯], he could be heard several hundred paces away. In the Su-men Mountains (Honan) there appeared from nowhere a Realized Man [真人] about whom the woodcutters were all relaying tales. Juan Chi went to see for himself and spied the man squatting with clasped knees by the edge of a cliff. Chi climbed the ridge to approach him and then squatted opposite him. Chi rehearsed for him briefly matters from antiquity to the present, beginning with an exposition of the Way of Mystical Quiescence [玄寂] of the Yellow Emperor and Shen Nung, and ending with an investigation of the excellence of the Supreme Virtue [盛德] of the Three Ages (Hsia, Shang, and Chou). But when Chi asked his opinion about it he remained aloof and made no reply. Chi then went on to expound that which lies beyond Activism [有為之教], and the techniques of Resting the Spirit [棲神] and Conducting the Vital Force [導氣]. But when Chi looked toward him for a reply, he was still exactly as before, fixedly staring without turning. Chi therefore turned toward him and made a long whistling sound [長嘯]. After a long while the man finally laughed and said, "Do it again." Chi whistled a second time [復嘯], but as his interest was now exhausted, he withdrew. He had returned about half-way down the ridge when he heard above him a shrillness like an orchestra of many instruments, while forests and valleys reechoed with the sound. Turning back to look, he discovered it was the whistling of the man he had just visited [向人嘯]. (49, tr. Mather 1976: 331) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Holzman (2009: 152) says that when Ruan Ji whistles, Sun Deng realizes that he is "not merely a pedant, but also an adept of an art that imitates nature, that he is able to control his breath so as to make it resemble that very breath of heaven."

The ''Shishuo xinyu'' commentary by Liu Xiaobiao quotes two texts. First, the (4th century) ''Wei Shi Chunqiu'' 魏氏春秋 version says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Juan Chi often went riding alone wherever his fancy led him, not following the roads or byways, to the point where carriage tracks would go no farther, and always he would return weeping bitterly. Once while he was wandering in the Su-men Mountains there was a recluse living there whose name no one knew, and whose only possessions were a few ''hu''-measures of bamboo fruit, a mortar and pestle, and nothing more. When Juan Chi heard of him he went to see him and began conversing on the Way of Non-action [無為] of high antiquity, and went on to discuss the moral principles [義] of the Five Emperors and Three August Ones. The Master of Su-men remained oblivious and never even looked his way. Chi then with a shrill sound made a long whistling whose echoes reverberated through the empty stillness. The Master of Su-men finally looked pleased and laughed. After Chi bad gone down the hill, the Master gathered his breath and whistled shrilly with a sound like that of the phoenix. Chi had all his life been a connoisseur of music, and he borrowed the theme of his discussion with the Master of Su-men to express what was in his heart in a song, the words of which are: "The sun sets west of Mt. Pu-chou; The moon comes up from Cinnabar Pool. Essence of Yang is darkened and unseen; While Yin rays take their turn to win. His brilliance lasts but for a moment; her dark will soon again be full. If wealth and honor stay but for a trice must poverty and low estate be evermore?" (tr. Mather 1976: 331-332) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Second, the ''Zhulin Qixian Lun'' 竹林七賢論 (tr. Mather 1976: 332), by Dai Kui 戴逵 (d. 396) explains, "After Juan Chi returned (from the Su-men Mountains) he proceeded to compose the "Discourse on Mr. Great Man" [大人先生論]. What was said in this discourse all represented the basic feelings in his breast and heart. The main point was that Mr. Great Man was none other than Juan himself."

In addition, the ''Shishuo xinyu'' biography of Liu Daozhen 劉道真 says he was "good at singing and whistling [善歌嘯]".

===Jin shu===
Two chapters in the (648) ''[[Book of Jin]]'' record the meeting between Ruan Ji and Sun Deng.

Ruan Ji's biography (in chapter [[:s:zh:晉書/卷049|49]], Biographies) uses ''changxiao'' and ''xiao'' to describe his visit with Sun Deng.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Once [Juan] Chi met Sun Teng on Su-men Mountain [蘇門山]. [Juan Chi] touched on topics of ancient times, and on the arts of "posing the spirit" and "leading the breath" [棲神導氣之術]. [Sun] Teng kept silent throughout. As a result, [Juan] Chi expelled a long whistle [籍因長嘯而退], and took his leave. When he had descended halfway down the mountain, he heard a sound like the cry of the phoenix resounding throughout the peaks and valleys. It was the whistling of [Sun] Teng [乃登之嘯也]. (tr. Varsano 1999: 56)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Varsano (1999: 57) explains this transcendental whistling as a direct representation of the ineffable Dao, "his superhuman whistle, a primordial sound that does not describe the secrets of the universe, but incarnates it."

Sun Deng's biography ([[:s:zh:晉書/卷094|94]], Hermits and Recluses) does not mention ''xiao'' whistling, but this chapter uses ''xiao'' in the biography of Tao Qian 陶潛 [登東皋以舒嘯] and ''changxiao'' in that of Xia Tong 夏統 [集氣長嘯]. The ''Jin shu'' account of Sun Deng says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sun Teng, whose tzu was Kung-ho [公和], was a man of Kung in Chi commandery. He was homeless, but stayed in the mountains in the north of the commandery where he lived in a cavern in the earth that he had made for himself. In summer he wove grasses to wear as a shirt and in winter he let his hair down to cover himself.  He liked to read the ''I ching'' and played a one-stringed zither [一絃琴]. All those who saw him felt friendly towards him and took pleasure in his company. There was not an ounce of hatred or anger in him. He was one thrown into the water to arouse his anger, but he just came out and broke into an enormous guffaw. From time to time he would wander among men and some of the householders he passed would set out food and clothing for him, now of which he would keep: when he had taken his leave he threw them all away. Once when he went to the mountains at I-yang [宜陽山] he was seen by some charcoal burners who knew he was not an ordinary man. But when they talked to him, he did not answer. Wen-ti [Ssu-ma Chao] heard about it and sent Juan Chi to investigate. (tr. Holzman 2009: 149-150) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The context goes on to say that after Sun Deng refused to talk with Ruan Ji, Xi Kang followed Sun Deng travelling for three years. Since [[Sima Zhao]] became generalissimo in 255, Holzman dates Ruan Ji's visit around 257, and Xi Kang's around 258 to 260. Based on the different mountain names, Chan (1996: 151, 158) says Ruan Ji visited Sun Deng twice, first around 226-230, and then around 255-263; and dates Xi Kang's travels at around 249-251.

The ''Jinshu'' biography of Liu Kun 劉琨, the Governor of Bingzhou 并州 (modern [[Shanxi]]), records that once when the capital [[Taiyuan|Jinyang]] was under siege by an army of [[Xiongnu]] cavalry, Liu supposedly ended the siege by giving a ''qingxiao'' 清嘯 "clear whistle" and playing a ''[[hujia]]'' "a Mongolian double-reed instrument". "Liu Kun ascended a tall building by moonlight and emitted a clear ''xiao'' [清嘯]. When the Xiongnu soldiers heard it, they sighed sadly. In the middle of the night he played the ''hujia'' [a kind of oboe originating on the steppes, perhaps the predecessor of the ''sona'']; the Xiongnu became homesick on hearing it. He played again at dawn and he Xiongnu lifted the siege and left." (tr. Watt and Harper 2004: 8).

===Xiaozhi===
The anonymous (c. 8th century) ''Xiaozhi'' 嘯旨 "Principles of Whistling" is included in several collections of [[Tang dynasty]] literature, such as the ''Tangdai congshu'' 唐代叢書. According to the (c. 800) ''Fengshi wenjian ji'' 封氏聞見記, written by Feng Yan 封演, the ''Xiaozhi'' was written in 765 by a judge Sun Guang 孫廣, who is otherwise unknown. The titular word ''zhǐ'' 旨 means "intention; aim; meaning", and the translator [[Evangeline Edwards|E. D. Edwards]] (1957: 218) says the text is about "How to Whistle". Paul W. Kroll (1983: 250) translates ''Xiaozhi'' as "Directives on Whistling".

There are two theories regarding the origin of the "Principles of Whistling" (Edwards 1957: 217). The first is that during the [[Six Dynasties]] (220-589) period, some people opposed to Confucianism went into the mountains and did what they liked, including as, for example whistling, since Confucius looked down on those who whistled (e.g., ''Liji''). The other is the Daoist theory, which is more probable since the ''Xiaozhi'' frequently mentions Dao. The Daoists believed that breathing the breath of Nature was one means of gaining immortality, and by whistling they were breathing in accord with Nature, and therefore they came nearer to Immortality.

The ''Xiaozhi'' Preface begins with a definition that semantically expands ''xiao'' from "moan; call out" and "call back (a soul)" to a new meaning of "communicating (with the Daoist gods and spirits)".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Air forced outwards from the throat and ''low'' in key is termed speech; forced outwards from the tongue and ''high'' in key is termed ''hsiao'' (whistling). The low key of speech is sufficient for the conduct of human affairs, for the expression of our natural feelings; the high key of whistling can move supernatural beings and is everlasting. Indeed, though a good speaker can win response from a thousand ''li'', a good whistler commands the attention of the whole world of spirits. (tr. Edwards 1957: 218-219) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Donald Holzman (2009: 152) translates this as "a sound produced by breath striking against the tip of the tongue … a method of communicating with the spirits and achieving immortality", and comments, "Whatever whistling did signify, the important thing to note is that it was an unintellectual art, probably a fairly strange kind of sound divorced from speech and reason."

The Preface then outlines a Daoist mytho-history of ''xiao'' transmission. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Laozi]] transmitted it to [[Queen Mother of the West]], she to the Perfected Person of the South Polar Star 南極真人  [controller of human longevity], he to [[Guangchengzi]], he to the wind god [[Feng Bo]], and he to Xiaofu 嘯夫 Father of Whistling. Father of Whistling taught it to [7-inch-tall] Wu Guang 務光, he to [[Emperor Yao]], and Yao to [[Emperor Shun]], who invented the zither. Shun transmitted whistling to [[Yu the Great]], after whom the art declined until it was revived by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)]] Daoist transcendent Sun Gong 孫公 of [[Taihang Mountains|Mt. Taihang]] who obtained the technique, achieved the Way, and disappeared without teaching it to anyone. [[Ruan Ji]] had a smattering knowledge of the art but after him it was lost and no longer heard (adapted from Edwards 1957: 219-220). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (tr. Birrell 2000:24) says, "In appearance, Queen Mother of the West looks like a human, but she has a leopard's tail and the fangs of a tigress, and she is good at whistling. She wears a victory crown on her tangled hair." The ''Shanghaijing'' using ''xiao'' for the tiger-like Queen Mother's "whistling" parallels the ''Huainanzi'' using it for a tiger's "howl" (Su 2006: 19). The ''[[Liexian Zhuan]]'' lists the Father of Whistling, who could control fire, but does not mention whistling.

The ''Xiaozhi'' 嘯旨 has fifteen sections. Section 1 "First Principles" tells how to practice whistling, for instance, "regulate the respiration, correct the relative positions of lips and teeth, compose the sides of the mouth, relax the tongue, practise in some retired spot." It also gives twelve specific whistling techniques, such as (tr. Edwards 1957: 220-221), ''Waiji'' 外激— "Place the tongue in close contact with the inside of the upper teeth. Open wide both lips and force the breath outwards, letting the sound go out."; and ''Neiji'' 內激—"Place the tongue as before; close both lips, compressing them to a point, like the opening of a stalk of wheat. Pass the breath through, making the sound go inwards."

Titles of subsequent sections are either poetic descriptions of tunes, e.g., "Tiger in a Deep Ravine" (3), "Night Demons in a Lonely Wood" (5), and "Snow Geese and Swans Alighting" (7); or references to famous historical whistlers, e.g., "Su Men [Mountains]" (11) was transmitted by Sun Deng, and "The Loose Rhymes of Ruan" was composed by [[Ruan Ji]] (both mentioned above). The ''Xiaozhi'' explains and describes each whistling tune. Take, for example, "Su Men", which retells the story of Sun Deng and Ruan Ji (above), but with whistling instead of zither playing.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The 'Su Men' was composed by the Taoist Immortal Recluse, who lived in the Su Men Mountains (of Honan). The Holy One transmitted, he did not make it. The Immortal transmitted (the music of) [[Guangchengzi|Kuang Ch'eng]] and Wu Kuang 務光 in order to rejoice the spirit and expand the Tao. He did not regard music as the main task. In olden days there were those who roved in Su Men listening to the phoenix' songs. The notes were exquisitely clear, very different from the so-called pretended phoenix. The phoenix makes sounds but humans cannot hear them. How then can the Su Family know the sound of the phoenix? Hereafter, when seeking the sound, bring up the Immortal's whistle. The Immortal's whistle does not stop at fostering the Tao and gratifying the spirits; for indeed, in everyday affairs it brings harmony into the world, and peace in season. In oneself the Tao never dies, in objective matters it assists all that is sacred, and conducts the Five Influences. In the arcana of Nature order prevails. For success in obtaining response (to such efforts) nothing approaches music. The Immortal has evolved the one successful form. As to all wild things whistling is the one thing needful. Yuan Szu-tsung of Chin (Yuan Chi) was a fine whistler. Hearing that the Immortal thought himself his equal, he (Yuan) went to visit him. The Immortal remained seated with his hair in disorder. Yuan bowed repeatedly and inquired after his health. Thrice and again thrice he addressed his (uncivil) host. The Immortal maintained his attitude and made no response. Chi then whistled some score of notes and left. The Immortal, estimating that his guest had not gone far, began to whistle the Ch'ing Chueh [清角] to the extent of four or five movements. But Chi perceived that the mountains and all growing things took on a different sound. Presently came a fierce whirlwind with pelting rain, followed by phoenixes and peacocks in flocks; no one could count them. Chi was alarmed, but also pleased, and he returned home and wrote down the story. He obtained only two-tenths of it, and called it 'Su Men'. This is what they tell there. The motif of the song is lofty mountains and wide marshes, great heights and distances. (tr. Edwards 1957: 226) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Xiaozhi'' explains the essence of ''xiao'' whistling in the "Fleeting Cloud" (section 6, tr. Edwards 1957: 222-223), "The lute suits southern manners; the reed-organ suits the cry of the phoenix; the fife suits the dragon's drone. Every musical sound has its counterpart (in nature). So, the roar of the tiger and the drone of a dragon all have a proper sequence of notes." Transcendental whistling evokes the sounds of nature. Ronald Egan (1994: 248) describes ''changxiao'' as "a well-known method, associated with Taoist practices, by which the devotee prepares his own mind for the experience of nature and, simultaneously, attempts to elicit a sympathetic reaction" from nature.

"Standard Notes" (14, tr. Edwards 1957: 227) mentions Daoist immortality, "In comparatively modern days, Sun Kung [Sun Deng] was successful, but people did not listen. As to peaceful notes [平和], they stave off old age and do not allow one to die. These Standard notes are known about, but the notes themselves are lost." The last "Conclusion" section (15, tr. Edwards 1957: 228) says, "The conclusion is at the extremities of the [pentatonic] scale, the end of the Great Tao. After the days of Yao and Shun there was some idea of these notes, but the actual notes were lost." The Conclusion includes a (1520) [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] written by [[Ming dynasty]] scholar Geng Chen, who describes the book as exceedingly rare, and probably written by someone during the Tang dynasty.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The preface says, "the (Western) Queen Mother taught the Fairy of the South Polar Star; he passed it on to Kuang Ch'eng-tzu". This is extravagant talk, and not usually accepted. But the twelve methods are found in Sun Teng and Yuan Chi [i.e., [[Ruan Ji]]], so that we can truly say we have the general purport of Whistling. The Preface also says that Sun Teng did not hand on (the gift) to anyone, and after Yuan Chi it disappeared and was no more heard. … Now the voice of man is the voice of the universe (nature). Man may be ancient or modern, but sound is eternal, never new or old. Now this book is going forth and who knows whether a Sun or Yuan may not appear in some mountains or woods and, that being so, who can say that there is an end to Whistling? (tr. Edwards 1957: 228) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Xiaozhi houxu'' 肅旨後序 "Postface to the Principles of Whistling", written by the Ming dynasty scholar and artist [[Tang Yin]] (1470-1524), compares the non-verbal art of ''xiao'' whistling with a Daoist priest's secret incantation and a Buddhist monk's magical formula in Sanskrit (Su 2006: 43).

===Tang poetry===
[[Tang poetry]] is renowned in history of [[Chinese literature]]. Kroll (1983: 250) says many medieval poems mention ''changxiao'' "long whistling", but translators generally convert it into a dull "humming."

In the extensive ''[[Quan Tangshi]]'' collection of Tang poetry, ''xiao'' occurs in 385 poems, and ''changxiao'' in 89. For one example, the famous poet [[Li Bai]] (701-762) wrote six poems entitled "Wandering on Mount Tai", the first of which uses ''changxiao''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Climbing to the heights, I gaze afar at P'eng and Ying; The image imagined—the Terrace of Gold and Silver. At Heaven's Gate, one long whistle I give, And from a myriad ''li'' the clear wind comes. Jade maidens, four or five persons, Gliding and whirling descend from the Nine Peripheries. Suppressing smiles, they lead me forward by immaculate hands, And let fall to ''me'' a cup of fluid aurora! I bow my head down, salute them twice, Ashamed for myself not to be of a transcendent's caliber.—But broad-ranging enough now to make the cosmos dwindle, I'll leave this world behind, oh how far away! (tr. Kroll 1983: 249) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hushao===
The preeminent Chinese [[avant-garde]] author [[Ge Fei (author)|Ge Fei]] wrote the (1995) ''Hūshào'' 忽哨 "Whistling" short story, using the modern "whistle" term with ''shào''  哨 instead of ''xiào'' 嘯 in ''Xiaofu'', ''Xiaozhi'', etc. The two main characters are based on the historical figures Sun Deng and Ruan Ji who were proficient in transcendental whistling. Victor Mair, who translated "Whistling" into English, says
&lt;blockquote&gt;An old legend of the celebrated encounter between the two men has Ruan Ji visiting Sun Deng in his hermitage but not receiving any responses to his questions. Thereupon, he withdraws and, halfway up a distant mountain, lets out a loud, piercing whistle. This is followed by Sun Deng's magnificent whistled reply, which inspires Ruan Ji to write the "Biography of Master Great Man," an encomium in praise of the Taoist "true man" that also satirizes the conventional Confucian "gentleman". (1998:43) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Whistling" tells how the famous poet Ruan Ji regularly came to visit the aged hermit Sun Deng on Su 
Gate Mountain 蘇門山 in present-day [[Henan]], and play games of ''weiqi'' [[Go (game)|go]]. During one go game, Sun was silently pondering how to move a piece, and Ruan surprised him. "When the whistling sound suddenly arose, Sun Deng was totally unprepared for it. The strange, strident sound, mixed with the sounds of the billowing pines, reverberated through the valleys of Su Gate Mountain for a long while without expiring." (tr. Mair 1998:43).

After a final game of go, Ruan took his leave from Sun owing to the "prolonged and profound silence that made him feel bored." Sun watches Ruan's silhouette gradually dissolving into the dark green distance,
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the sound of whistling rose beneath the sunny empyrean, Sun Deng shuddered as though it were a bolt out of the blue. Shielding his eyes from the strong light with one hand, he saw Ruan Ji standing on the peak of Su Gate Mountain beneath a solitary tree. Against a backdrop of white clouds like thick cotton fleece, he stood motionless, seeing to wait for Sun Deng's answer. Sun Deng looked all around him, then quietly inserted his thumb and forefinger in his mouth—the extreme frailness of his body and the looseness of his teeth caused him to be unable to produce any sound. The shrill, desolate, plaintive whistle, accompanied by the soughing of the billowing pines, reverberated for a long time in the mountain valleys. It was like the sad wail of the poet who died long ago, penetrating through the barriers of time, continuing up till today, and sinking into the easily awakened dreams of a living person. (tr. Mair 1998: 68) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12684">The '''transpersonal''' is a term used by different schools of philosophy and psychology in order to describe experiences and worldviews that extend beyond the personal level of the psyche, and beyond mundane worldly events. 

==Definition and context==

The transpersonal has been defined as experiences ''in which the sense of identity or self extends beyond (trans) the individual or personal to encompass wider aspects of humankind, life, psyche or cosmos''. &lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"&gt; Walsh, R. and F. Vaughan. "On transpersonal definitions". ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology''. Vol. 25, No2, pp. 199-207, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The field of Transpersonal Psychiatry has defined the term as "development beyond conventional, personal or individual levels." &lt;ref name="Scotton et.al 1996"&gt; Scotton, Bruce W. "Introduction and Definition of Transpersonal Psychiatry". In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology. New York: Basic Books. &lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand; ''transpersonal practices are those structured activities that focus on inducing transpersonal experiences''.&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"/&gt;

One of the founders of the field of [[transpersonal psychology]], [[Stanislav Grof]], has defined transpersonal states of awareness as such: ''The common denominator of this otherwise rich and ramified group of phenomena is the feeling of the individual that his consciousness expanded beyond the usual ego boundaries and the limitations of time and space''.&lt;ref name="Grof 1993"&gt; Grof, Stanislav. (1975, 1993). Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research. New York: Viking, London: Souvenir Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is related to the terminology of peak experience, altered states of consciousness, and spiritual experiences. &lt;ref name="Miller 1998"&gt; Miller, John J. "Book Review: Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology". ''Psychiatric Services'' 49:541-542, April 1998. American Psychiatric Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grabovac &amp; Ganesan 2003"&gt; Grabovac, Andrea D. &amp; Ganesan, Soma. "Spirituality and Religion in Canadian Psychiatric Residency Training". ''Canadian Journal of Psychiatry'', Vol 48, No 3, April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; {{ref|a|Note a}} The term is also associated with psychedelic work, and psychotechnologies, that includes research with psychedelic plants and chemicals such as LSD, ibogaine, ketamine, peyote, ayahuasca and the vast variety of substances available to all human cultures throughout history.{{ref|b|Note b}}

==Origin of the term==

The term has an early precedent in the writing of philosopher [[William James]], who used the term "Trans-personal" in one of his lectures from 1905. &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"&gt; Vich, M.A. (1988) "Some historical sources of the term 'Transpersonal' ". ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 20 (2) 107-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"&gt;  Freeman, Anthony. "A Daniel Come To Judgement? Dennett and the Revisioning of Transpersonal Theory". ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'', 13, No. 3, 2006, pp. 95–109&lt;/ref&gt; However, this early terminology, introduced by James, had a different meaning than the current one &lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt; and its context was philosophy, not psychology, &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt; which is where the term is mostly used these days.

There has also been some speculation of an early precedent of the term in the writings of [[Carl Jung]], as a result of the work of Jung's translators. It regards the jungian term ''ueberpersonlich'', used by Jung in a paper from 1917, which in later english translations appeared as ''superpersonal'', and later, ''transpersonal''.&lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotton et.al 1996"/&gt; {{ref|c|Note c}} In a later, revised, version of the ''Psychology of the Unconscious'' (1942) there was even a chapter heading called ''The Personal and the Collective (or Transpersonal) Unconscious''. &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff &amp; Lu 2005"&gt; Lukoff, David and Lu, Francis. ''A Transpersonal-Integrative Approach to Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy'', in L. Sperry and E. P. Shafranske (2005) Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy, American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the origin of the term transpersonal, as it is currently used in academic writing, is mostly associated with the [[human potential movement]] of the 1960s and the founders of the field of [[Transpersonal psychology]]; Anthony Sutich, [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Stanislav Grof]]. &lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"&gt; Valle, Ronald S. &amp; Harari, Carmi. Current developments in...Transpersonal Psychology. ''The Humanistic Psychologist'', 11, Vol. 13, NO. 1, Winter 1985&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Judy 1994"&gt; Judy, Dwight. Transpersonal psychology: Coming of age. ''ReVision'', 02756935, Winter94, Vol. 16, Issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferrer2002"&gt; Ferrer, J. N. (2002). "Revisioning transpersonal theory: A participatory vision of human spirituality". Albany,NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff &amp; Lu 2005"/&gt; According to Vich &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt; all three had used the term as early as 1967, in order to describe new ideas in the field of Psychology. In 1968 the term was selected by the founding editors of the [[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]], Abraham Maslow and Anthony Sutich, in order to represent a new area of psychological inquiry. &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;{{ref|d|Note d}} According to Powers &lt;ref name="Powers 2005"&gt; Powers, Robin. "Counseling and Spirituality: A Historical Review". ''Counseling and Values'', Apr 2005, Vol.49(3), pp.217-225.&lt;/ref&gt; the term “transpersonal” starts to show up in academic journals from 1970 and onwards.

==The transpersonal movement==

The collective of people and organizations with an interest in the ''transpersonal'' is called the ''transpersonal movement''. Walsh and Vaughan&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"/&gt; defines the transpersonal movement as ''the interdisciplinary movement that includes various individual transpersonal disciplines''. 

The philosophy of [[William James]], the school of [[Psychosynthesis]] (founded by Roberto Assagioli), and the Analytical school of [[Carl Jung]] are often considered to be forerunners to the establishment of transpersonal theory.&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt; However, the start of the movement is associated with the emergence and growth of the related field of [[Humanistic Psychology]]. Several of the academic profiles of the early transpersonal movement, such as [[Abraham Maslow]] and Anthony Sutich, had their background in Humanistic Psychology. &lt;ref name="Keutzer 1984"&gt;Keutzer, C.S. Transpersonal Psychotherapy: Reflections on the Genre. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'', 1984, Vol. 15, No. 6, 868-883&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor 1992"&gt;Taylor, Eugene. Transpersonal Psychology: Its several Virtues. ''The Humanistic Psychologist'', Vol. 20, Nos. 2 and 3, pp. 285-300, 1992. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 1993"&gt; Walsh, R. The Transpersonal Movement: A History and State of the Art. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 1993, Vol. 25, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  

The formative years of the transpersonal movement can be characterized by the founding of a few key organizations and institutions, such as: the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]] in 1973, ''The International Transpersonal Psychology Association'' in 1973, [[Naropa University|Naropa Institute]] in 1974, and the [[Sofia University (California)|California Institute of Transpersonal Psychology]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1992"/&gt; The ''California Institute of Transpersonal Psychology'' later emerged as the ''Institute of Transpersonal Psychology'' and is today known as [[Sofia University (California)|Sofia University]]. 

Contemporary [[transpersonal disciplines]] include [[Transpersonal psychology]], [[Transpersonal anthropology]], [[Transpersonal sociology]] and [[Transpersonal ecology]]. Other academic orientations, whose main focus lies elsewhere, but that are associated with a transpersonal perspective, include [[Humanistic psychology]] and [[Near-Death Studies]]. &lt;ref name="Scotton Chinen Battista"&gt; Scotton, B.W., Chinen, A.B. and Battista, J.R. (ed. 1996). ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary institutions include: the [[Association for Transpersonal Psychology]] (ATP), the ''European Transpersonal Psychology Association'' (EPTA), the ''International Transpersonal Association'' (ITA), and the ''European Transpersonal Association'' (Eurotas). Leading publications within the movement include: the [[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]], the [[International Journal of Transpersonal Studies]], and the ''Journal of Transpersonal Research''.

==Transpersonal studies==

Several commentators note how the transpersonal field, and its vision, moved beyond the perspective of psychology and into other transpersonal domains during the 1980's and 1990's.&lt;ref name="Grof Friedman Lukoff Hartelius"&gt;Grof, S., Friedman, H., Lukoff, D., &amp; Hartelius, G. (2008). The past and future of the International Transpersonal Association. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 27(1), 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caplan Hartelius Rardin"&gt;Caplan, Hartelius &amp; Rardin. Contemporary viewpoints on Transpersonal Psychology. ''The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 2003, Vol. 35, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion of the transpersonal concept resulted in an interdisciplinary situation, and a dialogue with such fields as [[social work]], [[ecology]], [[art]], [[literature]], [[acting]], [[law]], [[business]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[ecopsychology]], [[feminism]] and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Caplan Hartelius Rardin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grof Friedman Lukoff Hartelius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Atlas, N. (2016). (Book Review) The Wiley-Blackwell handbook of transpersonal psychology, by Harris L. Friedman &amp; Glenn Hartelius (Eds.) ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 35 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

In this respect, commentators have suggested that there is a difference between the founding field of [[Transpersonal psychology]] and a broader field of Transpersonal inquiry, known as ''Transpersonal studies''.&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"&gt;Chinen, Allan B. ''The emergence of Transpersonal psychiatry''. In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman 2002"&gt; Friedman, H. (2002). Transpersonal psychology as a scientific field. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 21(1), 175–187.&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiation of the Transpersonal field has to do with the scope of the subjects under study, and the interest of researchers and theorists. 

In their review of transpersonal definitions, published in 1993, Walsh and Vaughan&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"/&gt; noted that ''Transpersonal studies'' had grown beyond the founding field of [[Transpersonal psychology]]. Commenting on the criticisms of Transpersonal psychology in the 1980's, Chinen &lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; noted how the criticism did not differentiate between Transpersonal psychology, on the one hand, and a broad range of popularized transpersonal orientations, on the other. The same line of reasoning was picked up by Friedman,&lt;ref name="Friedman 2002"/&gt; who differentiated between a broad domain of inquiry known as Transpersonal studies, and a more narrow field of Transpersonal psychology. Both authors argued that the confounding of the two domains resulted in confusion. In a ''summary of contemporary viewpoints on Transpersonal psychology'' [[Jorge Ferrer]]&lt;ref name="Caplan Hartelius Rardin"/&gt; placed Transpersonal psychology within the wider "umbrella" known as ''Transpersonal studies''.

The [[International Journal of Transpersonal Studies]] was established in 1981. It is sponsored by the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]], and serves as the official publication of the International Transpersonal Association.&lt;ref name="Atlas"/&gt;

{{Distinguish|Obrigkeitsstaat}}
The term '''''Unrechtsstaat''''' is a pejorative used to refer to a [[State (polity)|state]] that is not a [[Rechtsstaat]], or a constitutional state in which the exercise of governmental power is not constrained by the law.&lt;ref&gt;Sendler, [[Zeitschrift für Rechtspolitik|ZRP]] 1993, 1 ff., 2&lt;/ref&gt; It is used not only as a jurisprudential term but also as a political one.&lt;ref&gt;Wassermann, [[Neue Juristische Wochenschrift|NJW]] 1997, 2152 f., 2153&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connotations ==
It is the opinion of [[Horst Sendler]] that an Unrechtsstaat is characterized by a lack of striving for rights and an overall failure to achieve them.&lt;ref name="Sendler"&gt;Sendler, [[Zeitschrift für Rechtspolitik|ZRP]] 1993, 1 ff., 4&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, individual violations of law and constitution do not make a state an Unrechtsstaat, because such violations also occur in a Rechtsstaat.&lt;ref name="Sendler" /&gt; Also, a state should not necessarily be considered an "Unrechtsstaat," even if it does not correspond with the model of a classical civil Rechtsstaat and in particular the [[Germany|German]] concept of a Rechtsstaat.&lt;ref&gt;Sendler, [[Zeitschrift für Rechtspolitik|ZRP]] 1993, 1 ff., 3&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the term "Unrechtsstaat" does not exclude the possibility of instances in which such a state has areas where qualities characteristic of a Rechtsstaat are dominant and where justices is realized in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Sendler, [[Neue Justiz|NJ]], 1991, 379 ff., 380&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to this notion of an Unrechtsstaat, [[Gerd Roellecke]] holds that the differentiating quality of an Unrechtsstaat is that it does not expect the equality of all people. In contrast with historical "Nichtrechtstaaten" (non-Rechstaaten), Unrechtstaaten have the capacity to be Rechstaaten after a period of historical development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gerd Roellecke |publisher=FAZ.net |url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubCF3AEB154CE64960822FA5429A182360/Doc~E5C24C1DE09D24A248777027712B9409C~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html?rss_aktuell |format= |title=War die DDR ein Unrechtsstaat? |date=15 June 2009 |access-date=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2014-06-02 Sudan Flüchtlinge Protest gegen Abschiebung, Weißekreuzplatz Hannover, (07) Getränke an der Volxküche.jpg|thumb|A Volxküche event in Germany, 2014]]
'''VolxKuche'''/'''VolxKüche''' ('''VoKu'''/'''VoKü'''), '''peoples kitchen''', '''free supper club''' or '''kitchen for all''', are names used for a weekly or regularly occurring group cooking event, at which the meal is served free of charge or at cost. The name derives from the German expression "people's kitchen" (soup kitchen), as a secular counterpart of the Christian [[soup kitchen]].

Volxküchen are found usually in collective and/or self-managed arrangements (pubs, information stores, youth centers or autonomous centers) with politically left self-identity. In general at least one vegetarian meal is offered, frequently also vegan food. Often soon to be [[Shelf life|expired]] ingredients are obtained at cost, or donated by food banks, food manufacturers or community gardens.&lt;ref name="VokuCookbook"&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
The Volxküche in the current sense arose in the European squatter scene of the early 1980s.

==English spelling and pronunciation==
The spelling of Volxküche occurred as an expression of anti-nationalism. Historically nationalism had used the term "[[Volk (German word)|Volk]]/Volks" with negative consequences.  This use was a rejection of the negative connotation which had the intention of "excluding" many groups of German society. It is at the same time a funny self-willed expression of the anarchistic and/or autonomous scene.

In the US the word is spelled without an umlaut, and pronounced like "folks coo heh". The alternate German spelling Volkskueche (Volksküche) was intentionally not used.

== US locations ==
A 'Free Supper Club" in San Francisco, held twice a month as of 2013, is calling itself ''Volxkuche''. Besides a free dinner, performances, film and community are provided.&lt;ref&gt;VokuSF Website: http://www.vokusf.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese philosophy]], '''yin and yang''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ɪ|n}} and {{IPAc-en||j|ɑː|ŋ|,_|j|æ|ŋ}}; {{lang-zh|{{linktext|陰|陽}}}} ''yīnyáng'', lit. "dark-bright", "negative-positive") describes how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another. In Chinese cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is the receptive and Yang the active principle, seen in all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (north-facing shade and south-facing brightness), sexual coupling (female and male), the formation of both men and women as characters, and sociopolitical history (disorder and order).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|last=Feuchtwang|first=Stephan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-415-85881-6|location=New York|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are various dynamics in Chinese cosmology. In the cosmology pertaining to Yin and Yang, the material energy, which this universe has created itself out of, is also referred to as [[qi]]. It is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of Yin and Yang has formed many things &lt;ref&gt;Feuchtwang, Sephan. “Chinese Religions.” Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, Third ed., Routledge, 2016, pp. 150-151. &lt;/ref&gt;. Included among these forms are humans. Many tangible [[Dualistic cosmology|dualities]] (such as [[light and dark]], fire and water, expanding and contracting) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang. This duality lies at the origins of many branches of classical [[Chinese science]] and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of [[traditional Chinese medicine]],&lt;ref name=Porkert1974&gt;{{cite book|author=Porkert|title=The Theoretical Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=MIT Press|year=1974|isbn=0-262-16058-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a central principle of different forms of [[Chinese martial arts]] and exercise, such as [[baguazhang]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|taijiquan]] (t'ai chi), and [[qigong]] (Chi Kung), as well as appearing in the pages of the ''[[I Ching]]''.

The notion of a duality can be found in many areas, such as [[Duality (CoPs)|Communities of Practice]], but in this context yin and yang are better viewed as parts of an oneness that is expressed in the [[Tao]]. The term "dualistic-monism" or [[dialectical monism]] has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful [[paradox]] of simultaneous unity and duality. Yin and yang can be thought of as complementary (rather than opposing) forces that interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Georges Ohsawa]]|year=1976|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=oQqDZnm43mkC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=The Unique Principle|isbn=978-0-918860-17-0|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this philosophy, everything has both yin and yang aspects (for instance, shadow cannot exist without light).  Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object, depending on the criterion of the observation. The yin yang (i.e. [[taijitu]] symbol) shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section.

In [[Taoism|Taoist]] metaphysics, distinctions between good and bad, along with other dichotomous moral judgments, are perceptual, not real; so, the duality of yin and yang is an indivisible whole. In the ethics of [[Confucianism]] on the other hand, most notably in the philosophy of [[Dong Zhongshu]] ({{circa}} 2nd century BC), a moral dimension is attached to the idea of yin and yang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor Latener|first=Rodney Leon|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Confucianism|volume=2|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2005|page=869|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8239-4079-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic aspects==
These [[Chinese language|Chinese]] terms ''yin'' 陰 or 阴 "shady side" and ''yang'' 陽 or 阳 "sunny side" are linguistically analyzable in terms of [[Chinese characters]], [[pronunciations]] and [[etymology]], [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]], [[topography]], and [[loanword]]s.

===Characters===
The [[Traditional Chinese characters]] {{linktext|陰}}  and {{linktext|陽}} for the words ''yīn'' and ''yáng'' are both classified as [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|radical- esphonetic characters]], combining the semantically significant [[Radical 170|"mound; hill" radical]] {{linktext|阝}} or {{linktext|阜}} with the phonetic indicators ''ying'' {{linktext|侌}} and ''yang'' {{linktext|昜}}. The first phonetic ''yīn'' {{linktext|侌|}} "cloudy" ideographically combines ''jīn'' {{linktext|今|}} "now; present" and ''yún'' {{linktext|云|}} "cloud", denoting the "今 presence of 云 clouds".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Karlgren]], ''Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese'', Paul Geunthner, 1923, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The second phonetic ''yáng'' {{linktext|昜|}} "bright" originally pictured {{linktext|日}} the "sun" with {{linktext|勿|}} "rays coming down".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wenlin]]'', version 4.1.1, 2012, n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; This phonetic is expanded with the [[Radical 72|"sun" radical]] into ''yáng'' 暘 "rising sun; sunshine". The "mound; hill" radical 阝full forms semantically specify ''yīn'' 陰 "shady/dark side of a hill" and ''yáng'' 陽 "sunny/light side of a hill".

The [[Simplified Chinese characters]] {{linktext|阴}} and {{linktext|阳}} for ''yīn'' and ''yáng'' combine the same "hill" radical 阝 with the non-phonetic ''yuè'' {{linktext|月}} "moon" and ''rì'' {{linktext|日}} "sun", graphically denoting "shady side of a hill" and "sunny side of a hill". Compare the [[Classical Chinese]] names (which contain ''tài'' {{linktext|太}} "great") for these two heavenly bodies: ''Tàiyīn'' {{linktext|太陰}} "moon" and ''Tàiyáng'' {{linktext|太陽}} "sun".

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The [[Modern Standard Chinese]] pronunciation of 陰 or 阴 is usually level first [[Four tones|tone]] ''yīn'' "shady; cloudy" or sometimes falling fourth tone ''yìn'' "to shelter; shade", and 陽 or 阳 "sunny" is always pronounced with rising second tone ''yáng''.

Sinologists and historical linguists have reconstructed [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciations from data in the (7th century CE) ''[[Qieyun]]'' [[rhyme dictionary]] and later [[rhyme tables]], which was subsequently used to reconstruct [[Old Chinese phonology]] from rhymes in the (11th-7th centuries BCE) ''[[Shijing]]'' and phonological components of Chinese characters. [[Reconstructions of Old Chinese]] have illuminated the etymology of modern Chinese words.

Compare these Middle Chinese and Old Chinese (with asterisk) reconstructions of ''yīn'' 陰 and ''yáng'' 陽:
* ''ˑiəm'' &lt; *''ˑiəm'' and ''iang'' &lt; *''diang'' ([[Bernhard Karlgren]])&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Karlgren, ''Grammata Serica Recensa'', Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 1957, 173, 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
* *''ʔjəm'' and *''raŋ'' ([[Li Fang-Kuei]])&lt;ref&gt;Li, Fang-Kuei, "Studies on Archaic Chinese", translated by Gilbert L. Mattos, ''Monumenta Serica'' 31, 1974:219–287.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''ʔ(r)jum'' and *''ljang'' ([[William H. Baxter]]),&lt;ref&gt;William H. Baxter, ''A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology'', Mouton de Gruyter ,1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ʔjəm'' &lt; *''ʔəm'' and ''jiaŋ'' &lt; *''laŋ'' (Axel Schuessler)&lt;ref&gt;Schuessler, Axel, ''ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese'', [[University of Hawaii Press]], 2007, 558, 572.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''im'' &lt; *''qrum'' and ''yang'' &lt; *''laŋ'' ([[William H. Baxter]] and [[Laurent Sagart]])&lt;ref&gt;Baxter &amp; Sagart (2014), pp. 326-378.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schuessler gives probable [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] etymologies for both Chinese words.

''Yin'' &lt; *''ʔəm'' compares with [[Burmese language|Burmese]] ''ʔum&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;'' "overcast; cloudy", [[Adi language|Adi]] ''muk-jum'' "shade", and [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]] ''so'yǔm'' "shade"; and is probably cognate with Chinese ''àn'' &lt; *''ʔə̂mʔ'' {{linktext|黯}} "dim; gloomy" and ''qīn'' &lt; *''khəm'' {{linktext|衾}} "blanket"

''Yang'' &lt; *''laŋ'' compares with Lepcha ''a-lóŋ'' "reflecting light", Burmese ''laŋ&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;'' "be bright" and ''ə-laŋ&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;'' "light"; and is perhaps cognate with Chinese ''chāng'' &lt; *''k-hlaŋ'' {{linktext|昌}} "prosperous; bright"; ''bǐng'' &lt; *''braŋʔ'' {{linktext|炳}} "bright"; ''liàng'' &lt; ''*raŋh'' {{linktext|亮}} "(pale) light"; ''lǎng'' &lt; ''raŋʔ'' {{linktext|朗}} "brilliant light"; ''míng'' &lt; ''mraŋ'' {{linktext|明}} "bright, become light, enlighten". Schuessler surmises that those items either are [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area|areal]] words (cf. [[Tai languages|Tai]] ''plaŋ&lt;sup&gt;A1&lt;/sup&gt;'' "bright") or belong to an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] word family (cf. Proto-[[Vietic languages|Viet-Muong]]  ''hlaŋ&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;''); owing to "the different OC initial consonant which seems to have no recognizable OC morphological function"&lt;ref&gt;Schuessler, Axel, ''ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese'', [[University of Hawaii Press]], 2007, 356.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Meanings===
''Yin'' and ''yang'' are semantically complex words. 

A reliable [[Chinese dictionary#Chinese-English dictionaries|Chinese-English dictionary]] gives the following translation equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;[[John DeFrancis]], ed., ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary'', University of Hawaii Press, 2003, 1147, 1108.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Yin''' 陰 or 阴 [[Noun]] ① [philosophy] negative/passive/female principle in nature ② Surname [[Bound morpheme]] ① the moon ② shaded orientation ③ covert; concealed; hidden ④ ⑦ negative ⑧ north side of a hill ⑨ south bank of a river ⑩ reverse side of a stele ⑪in intaglio [[Stative verb]] ① overcast &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Yang''' 陽 or 阳 [[Bound morpheme]] ① [Chinese philosophy] positive/active/male principle in nature ②the sun ④ in relief ⑤ open; overt ⑥ belonging to this world ⑦ [linguistics] masculine ⑧ south side of a hill ⑨ north bank of a river &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''yin-yang'' 陰陽 or 阴阳 means "yin and yang; opposites; ancient Chinese astronomy; occult arts; astrologer; geomancer; etc.".

The [[Sinology|sinologist]] [[Rolf Stein]] etymologically translates Chinese ''yin'' 陰 "shady side (of a mountain)" and ''yang'' 陽 "sunny side (of a mountain)" with the uncommon English geographic terms ''[[wikt:ubac|ubac]]'' "shady side of a mountain" and ''[[wikt:adret|adret]]'' "sunny side of a mountain" (which are of [[List of English words of French origin|French origin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Stein (2010), ''Rolf Stein's Tibetica Antiqua: With Additional Materials'', Brill, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;...

===Toponymy===
Many Chinese place names or [[toponyms]] contain the word ''yang'' "sunny side" and a few contain ''yin'' "shady side". In [[China]], as elsewhere in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], sunlight comes predominantly from the south, and thus the south face of a mountain or the north bank of a river will receive more direct sunlight than the opposite side.

''Yang'' refers to the "south side of a hill" in [[Hengyang]] 衡陽, which is south of [[Mount Heng (Hunan)|Mount Heng]] 衡山 in [[Hunan]] province, and to the "north bank of a river" in [[Luoyang]] 洛陽, which is located north of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] 洛河 in [[Henan]].
 
Similarly, ''yin'' refers to "north side of a hill" in [[Huayin]] 華陰, which is north of [[Mount Hua]] 華山 in [[Shaanxi]] province.

In [[Japan]], the characters are used in western [[Honshu]] to delineate the north-side [[San'in region]] 山陰 from the south-side [[San'yō region]] 山陽, separated by the [[Chūgoku Mountains|Chugoku mountain range]] 中国山地.

===Loanwords===
English ''[[wikt:yin|yin]]'', ''[[wikt:yang|yang]]'', and ''[[wikt:yin-yang|yin-yang]]'' are familiar [[loanwords]] of [[List of English words of Chinese origin|Chinese origin]].

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''yin''' (jɪn) Also '''Yin''', '''Yn'''. [Chinese ''yīn'' shade, feminine; the moon.] 
'''a.''' In Chinese philosophy, the feminine or negative principle (characterized by dark, wetness, cold, passivity, disintegration, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also ''attrib''. or as ''adj''., and ''transf''. Cf. '''yang'''. 
'''b.''' ''Comb''., as '''yin-yang''', the combination or fusion of the two cosmic forces; freq. attrib., esp. as '''yin-yang symbol''', a circle divided by an S-shaped line into a dark and a light segment, representing respectively ''yin'' and ''yang'', each containing a 'seed' of the other. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''yang''' (jæŋ) Also '''Yang'''. [Chinese ''yáng'' yang, sun, positive, male genitals.] 
'''a.''' In Chinese philosophy, the masculine or positive principle (characterized by light, warmth, dryness, activity, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also ''attrib.'' or as ''adj.'' Cf. '''yin'''.
'''b.''' ''Comb.'': '''yang-yin''' = ''yin-yang'' s.v. '''yin b.'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the earliest recorded "yin and yang" usages, the ''OED'' cites 1671 for ''yin'' and ''yang'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnoldus Montanus]], ''Atlas Chinensis: Being a relation of remarkable passages in two embassies from the East-India Company of the United Provinces to the Vice-Roy Singlamong, General Taising Lipovi, and Konchi, Emperor, Thomas Johnson'', tr. by J. Ogilby, 1671, 549: "The Chineses by these Strokes ‥ declare ‥ how much each Form or Sign receives from the two fore-mention'd Beginnings of Yn or Yang."&lt;/ref&gt; 1850 for ''yin-yang'',&lt;ref&gt;[[William Jones Boone (son)|William Jones Boone]], "Defense of an Essay on the proper renderings of the words Elohim and θεός into the Chinese Language," ''Chinese Repository'' XIX, 1850, 375: "... when in the Yih King (or Book of Diagrams) we read of the Great Extreme, it means that the Great Extreme is in the midst of the active-passive primordial substance (Yin-yáng); and that it is not exterior to, or separate from the Yin-yáng."&lt;/ref&gt; and 1959 for ''yang-yin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Jung]], "Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self", in ''The Collected Works of C. G. Jung'', tr. by R. F. C. Hull, Volume 9, Part 2, p. 58" "[The vision of "Ascension of Isaiah"] might easily be a description of a genuine yang-yin relationship, a picture that comes closer to the actual truth than the ''privatio boni''. Moreover, it does not damage monotheism in any way, since it unites the opposites just and yang and yin are united in Tao (which the Jesuits quite logically translated as "God")."&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, ''yang-yin'' (like ''ying-yang'') occasionally occurs as a mistake or typographical error for the Chinese loanword ''yin-yang''— yet they are not equivalents. Chinese does have some ''yangyin'' [[collocation]]s, such as 洋銀 (lit. "foreign silver") "silver coin/dollar", but not even the most comprehensive dictionaries (e.g., the ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'') enter ''yangyin'' *陽陰. While ''yang'' and ''yin'' can occur together in context,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the ''[[Huainanzi]]'' says" "Now, the lumber is not so important as the forest; the forest is not so important as the rain; the rain is not so important as yin and yang; yin and yang are not so important as harmony; and harmony is not so important as the Way. (12, 材不及林，林不及雨，雨不及陰陽，陰陽不及和，和不及道; tr. Major et al. 2010, 442).&lt;/ref&gt; ''yangyin'' is not synonymous with ''yinyang''. The linguistic term "[[Siamese twins (linguistics)|irreversible binomial]]" refers to a collocation of two words A-B that cannot be idiomatically reversed as B-A, for example, English ''cat and mouse'' (not *''mouse and cat'') and ''friend or foe'' (not *''foe or friend''). Similarly, the usual pattern among Chinese binomial compounds is for positive A and negative B, where the A word is dominant or privileged over B, for example, ''tiandi'' 天地 "heaven and earth" and ''nannü'' 男女 "men and women". ''Yinyang'' meaning "dark and light; female and male; moon and sun", however, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why ''yinyang'' violates this pattern, including "linguistic convenience" (it is easier to say ''yinyang'' than ''yangyin''), the idea that "proto-Chinese society was matriarchal", or perhaps, since ''yinyang'' first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was "purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions".&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Ames, "''Yin'' and ''Yang''", in ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy'', ed. by Antonio S. Cua, Routledge, 2002, 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Needham discusses Yin and Yang together with [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]] as part of the [[School of Naturalists]]. He says that it would be proper to begin with Yin and Yang before Five Elements because the former: "lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the Yin and the Yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal with it first."&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Science and Civilization in China Vol.2:  History of Scientific Thought; [[Cambridge University Press]]; 1956&lt;/ref&gt; He then discusses [[Zou Yan]] (鄒衍; 305 – 240 BC) who is most associated with these theories. Although Yin and Yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School) Needham concludes "There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the -4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time."&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Science and Civilization in China Vol.2:  History of Scientific Thought; Cambridge University Press; 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese gender roles ===

In spite of being used in a modern context to justify egalitarianism under the notion of both yin and yang being "necessary", in practise the concept of yin and yang has led to justification for China's patriarchal history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/gender-c/]&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly under [[Confucianism]], yang (as the sun principle) is considered superior to "yin" (the dark principle), hence men are afforded rulership positions whereas women are not unless, under some remarkable circumstances, they possess sufficient yang.

The notion of yin and yang has led to the persecution and extinction of Asian sun goddess cults outside of Korea and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques H. Kamstra, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8sgUAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Yin%20yang&amp;f=false Encounter Or Syncretism: The Initial Growth of Japanese Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2018}}

==Nature==
In [[Daoism|Daoist]] philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the [[Tao Te Ching]] at chapter 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muller|first=Charles|title=Daode Jing|url=http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/daodejing.html#div-43|accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; It becomes sensible from an initial quiescence or emptiness ([[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until [[Wiktionary:quiescence|quiescence]] is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.

It is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a [[non-wellfounded mereology|mutual whole]] (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is{{cn|date=June 2012}} to postulate the notion of a race with only men or only women; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, men and women together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood.&lt;ref&gt;Robin R. Wang {{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/yinyang/|title=Yinyang (Yin-yang)|work=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky{{mdash}}an intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.

Certain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarity:&lt;ref&gt;[[Nyoiti Sakurazawa]] &amp; [[William Dufty]] (1965) ''You Are All Sanpaku'', page 33&lt;/ref&gt;
*The bigger the front, the bigger the back.
*Illness is the doorway to health.
*Tragedy turns to comedy.
*Disasters turn out to be blessings.

==Symbolism and importance==
Yin is the black side with the white dot in it, and yang is the white side with the black dot in it. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the "sunny place' or "south slope") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.

Yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, [[femininity]], and night time.

Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, [[masculinity]] and daytime.&lt;ref&gt;Osgood, Charles E. "From Yang and Yin to and or but." Language 49.2 (1973): 380–412 . [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The yin-yang symbol, having no "officially standardized" rendition, has been the basis of much artistic variation, most of it "frivolous" (that is, "merely" artistic, with no philosophical/mystical meaning, e.g., tattoos). {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Yin and yang also applies to the human body. In traditional Chinese medicine good health is directly related to the balance between yin and yang qualities within oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Li CL. A brief outline of Chinese medical history with particular reference to acupuncture. Perspect Biol Med. 1974 Autumn;18(1):132-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  If yin and yang become unbalanced, one of the qualities is considered deficient or has [[Emptiness|vacuity]].

===''I Ching''===
In the ''[[I Ching]]'', originally a divination manual of the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1000–750 BC),&lt;ref&gt;
The text of the ''I Ching'' has its origins in a [[Western Zhou]] divination text called the ''Changes of Zhou'' (周易 ''Zhōu yì'').  Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form. Nylan, Michael (2001), ''The Five "Confucian" Classics'' (2001), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (&lt;span style="font-size: 24px"&gt;⚋&lt;/span&gt;) and yang is solid (&lt;span style="font-size: 24px"&gt;⚊&lt;/span&gt;). These are then combined into [[ba gua|trigrams]], which are more yang (''e.g.'' ☱) or more yin (''e.g.'' ☵) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (''e.g.'', ☰ is heavily yang, while ☷ is heavily yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (''e.g.'' &lt;span style="font-size: 20px"&gt;䷕&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-size: 20px"&gt;䷟&lt;/span&gt;). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.

===Taijitu===
{{Main|Taijitu}}

The principle of yin and yang is represented in Taoism by the Taijitu (literally "Diagram of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Supreme Ultimate]]"). The term is commonly used to mean the simple "divided circle" form, but may refer to any of several schematic diagrams representing these principles, such as the [[swastika]], common to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Similar symbols have also appeared in other cultures, such as in [[Celtic art]] and [[Notitia Dignitatum#Depictions|Roman shield markings]].&lt;ref name="Giovanni Monastra (2000)"&gt;Giovanni Monastra: "[http://www.estovest.net/tradizione/yinyang_en.html#t24 The "Yin–Yang" among the Insignia of the Roman Empire?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925054740/http://www.estovest.net/tradizione/yinyang_en.html |date=2011-09-25 }}," "Sophia," Vol. 6, No. 2 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Late Roman Shield Patterns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/luke/ueda-sarson/MagisterPeditum.html|title=Late Roman Shield Patterns - Magister Peditum|work=www.ne.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helmut Nickel (1992), 146, 5"&gt;Helmut Nickel: "The Dragon and the Pearl," ''Metropolitan Museum Journal,'' Vol. 26 (1991), p. 146, Fn. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taijiquan===
{{main|T'ai chi ch'uan}}
Taijiquan (Chinese: 太极拳), a form of martial art, is often described as the principles of yin and yang applied to the human body and an animal body. [[Wu Jianquan]], a famous [[Chinese martial arts]] teacher, described Taijiquan as follows:

{{quotation|Various people have offered different explanations for the name ''Taijiquan''. Some have said: – 'In terms of [[meditation|self-cultivation]], one must train from a state of movement towards a state of stillness. ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]'' comes about through the balance of ''yin'' and ''yang''. In terms of the art of attack and defense then, in the context of the [[I Ching|changes]] of full and empty, one is constantly internally latent, to not outwardly expressive, as if the ''yin'' and ''yang'' of ''Taiji'' have not yet divided apart.' Others say: 'Every movement of ''Taijiquan'' is based on circles, just like the shape of a ''Taijitu''. Therefore, it is called ''Taijiquan''.|Wu Jianquan|The International Magazine of T’ai Chi Ch’uan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woolidge|first=Doug|title=T’AI CHI The International Magazine of T’ai Chi Ch’uan Vol. 21 No. 3|publisher=Wayfarer Publications|date=June 1997|issn=0730-1049}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
