The '''1961 F-84 Thunderstreak incident''', occurring on 14 September 1961, was an incident during the [[Cold War (1953–1962)|Cold War]], in which two [[Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]] [[fighter-bomber]]s of [[Jagdbombergeschwader 32|''JaBoG 32'']] of the [[German Air Force]] (''Luftwaffe'') crossed into East German [[airspace]] because of a navigational error, before landing at [[Berlin Tegel Airport]]. The two planes successfully evaded a large number of Soviet fighter planes by finding cover in a heavy layer of clouds,&lt;ref name="Spiegel" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45139958.html STRAUSS-BEFEHL: Bier-Order 61] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 9 May 1962, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but also by the actions of an airman at the [[United States Air Force]] air route traffic control center at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] who ordered the planes on to Berlin rather than forcing them to turn around and face the pursuing fighter planes.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; The event came at a historically difficult time in relations between the two Germanies. Only a month before, the [[Berlin Wall]] had been built, which completely cut off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from [[East Berlin]]. It also came three days before the [[West German federal election, 1961|West German federal election]], held on 17 September 1961.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Background==
At the time, violations of airspace at the border between West and East Germany were common, with, on average, two aircraft a month belonging to members of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) crossing into Eastern airspace while a much larger number of Soviet planes crossed into that of West Germany. There were 38 violations of West Germany's air space by Soviet aircraft in a period of just four weeks between August and September 1961. Some of the violations were deliberate, to determine the opposite side's reaction, while others were by mistake, caused by the difficulty in determining the border line from the air.&lt;ref name="Monat" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45141349.html LUFTZWISCHENFALL: Zweimal monatlich] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 29 August 1962, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the end of the Second World War and the [[German reunification]], West German planes were not permitted to fly to West Berlin, regardless of whether they were civilian or military aircraft. The three existing [[West Berlin Air Corridor|air corridors]] to the city were only open to planes from the three wartime [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]: the United States, France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Tages" &gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/angriffshoehe-800/394316.html Angriffshöhe 800] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', published: 2 March 2003, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
On 14 September 1961, under the code name ''Checkmate'', the [[NATO]] high command mobilised the air forces of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and West Germany for the purpose of an [[military exercise|exercise]]. As part of this exercise, the ''[[Jagdbomber]]''s of ''[[Jagdbombergeschwader 32|Jagdbombergeschwader (JaBoG) 32]]'', based at [[Lechfeld Airbase]], south of [[Augsburg]], were to fly a triangular route from [[Würzburg]] to [[Laon]] and then to [[Memmingen]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Two F-84 fighter-bombers, flown by [[Feldwebel]] Peter Pfefferkorn and [[Unteroffizier|Stabsunteroffizier]] Hans Eberl,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n6qRFggA1sMC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=Pfefferkorn+Eberl+14+September+1961&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DmhvySvrU0&amp;sig=fafOuilSu-d-gI-tp-thRCLE1m4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lOL1TKfHN4nprAfn0p32Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Pfefferkorn%20Eberl%2014%20September%201961&amp;f=false Krieg um Berlin?: die sowjetische Militär- und Sicherheitspolitik] {{de icon}} google book review, author: Matthias Uhl, accessed: 1 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; lost their course in the process of flying this route, with the compass on Pfefferkorn's plane misreading by between 40 and 60 degrees. Additionally, a strong westerly wind was greater in strength than had been forecasted. On their way from Würzburg to Laon, the two pilots had become so disoriented that they mistook [[Liège]] in Belgium for [[Reims]] in France.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Shortly after, the pair were picked up by NATO radar stations near [[Warburg]], in southern [[Westphalia]], heading east, in the direction of [[Königs Wusterhausen]], south of Berlin. The two pilots missed a radio call from the radar stations advising them to turn around because they were talking to each other, trying to establish their location.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

It was only when reaching a position north of [[Leipzig]], deep within East German air space, that Pfefferkorn sent a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] signal, which was picked up, to their surprise, by the French-controlled airport at Tegel in [[West Berlin]], which gave them permission to land. The planes had initially not been noticed by the radar operator at the [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] because he was concentrating on an incoming [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] [[Douglas DC-6]]. By the time they were noticed, the pair were being unsuccessfully chased by a large number of Soviet fighter aircraft. An airman in the Berlin Air Route Traffic Control Center ordered the two pilots not to turn around and face the pursuing fighter planes but instead to head for the Tegel airport as it had a longer runway than Tempelhof and was more suitable for jets.&lt;ref name="Fifty"&gt;[http://www.50jahre-jabog32.de/Leseproben_50_Jahre_Jagdbombergeschwader_32.pdf 50 Jahre Jagdbombergeschwader 32] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718193436/http://www.50jahre-jabog32.de/Leseproben_50_Jahre_Jagdbombergeschwader_32.pdf |date=18 July 2011 }} {{de icon}} 50 Years Jagdbombergeschwader 32, accessed; 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the actions of this airman and the heavy cloud cover, which the two pilots used to conceal themselves, Pfefferkorn and Eberl escaped the pursuing Soviet aircraft and successfully landed their planes without further incident at Tegel.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Reaction==
===International===
Immediately after the two aircraft landed, the French authorities at Tegel airport explained to the Soviet authorities in East Berlin that, because of technical difficulties, an [[emergency landing]] of the two planes had been absolutely necessary.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The then-West German [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]], [[Franz-Josef Strauß]], apologised to the Soviet ambassador in [[Bonn]] for the incident, sending his secretary of state, [[Volkmar Hopf]]. The government of the Soviet Union remained silent for a number of days with regards to the incident, before officially protesting against the West German "provocation" and threatening to shoot down any aircraft involved if the incident was repeated.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The Soviet air command in East Germany was less than impressed with the 'unpunished' flight of two Western fighter planes through their airspace. However, it chose to blame bad weather for the incident rather than the failure of its ground control to guide the Soviet fighter planes on to the West German ones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RYYuSGcwq5AC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Pfefferkorn+and+Eberl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VHqzsIhtcf&amp;sig=by3WlbzluCGCPMVwWI0WHSU6Fwc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8P70TIfGFsGecfmj4dcE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pfefferkorn%20and%20Eberl&amp;f=false Vor dem Abgrund: die Streitkräfte der USA und der UdSSR] {{de icon}} google book review, author: Dimitrij N. Filippovych, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0033, Josef Kammhuber retusche.jpg|thumb|200px|Josef Kammhuber]]
[[Willy Brandt]], the leader of the opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] in the upcoming federal elections, and the mayor of West Berlin, questioned how the two pilots could be put in a situation where they would be forced to violate international conventions in a time of strained relations between the East and the West. Initially, Strauß announced a stringent investigation into the incident; instead, however, he and [[Josef Kammhuber]], [[Inspector of the Air Force]], transferred the commander of ''JaBoG 32'', [[Oberstleutnant]] [[Siegfried Barth]], and announced that any commander whose unit committed a violation of international borders would be immediately replaced.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

When Kammhuber announced this order at Lechfeld the following day, it was dubbed ''Bier Order 61'' (''Beer Order 61'') because it was formulated late at night over drinks between Kammhuber and Strauß. Barth, commander of ''JaBoG 32'', was not questioned with regard to the incident, and was not allowed to speak during Kammhuber's visit. Instead, [[Generalleutnant]] [[Martin Harlinghausen]], Barth's superior officer, who had once, in 1944, stood up to [[Hermann Göring]], spoke for Barth and demanded a proper investigation.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Two weeks later, Harlinghausen was forced into early retirement. The non-commissioned officers of ''JaBoG 32'' sent a letter to Strauß requesting that Barth should retain his command, without receiving any answer. Eventually, a proper investigation was conducted which found Barth to be innocent, a result unacceptable to Kammhuber, who initiated a second investigation that found the ''Oberstleutnant'' partly at fault. A third investigation followed, which again found Barth to be innocent. Oberstleutnant Barth then lodged an official complaint against Franz-Josef Strauß. Strauß, as minister of defence, ordered all witnesses in the case - Generals Kammhuber, Harlinghausen, [[Werner Panitzki]] and [[Werner Streib]] as well as Lieutenant Colonels [[Walter Krupinski]] and [[Walter Grasemann]] - [[gag order|not to speak]], as they were all military personnel and therefore under his command. Nevertheless, his conduct in dismissing Barth was found to be at fault, and the latter had to be reinstated in his position. Strauß, however, ignored this decision until [[Hellmuth Heye]], [[Ombudsman]] for the Military, forced him to accept it.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt; Strauß himself was later forced to resign from his post as Minister of Defence, in the wake of the [[Spiegel scandal|''Spiegel'' scandal]] in 1962. Kammhuber retired from his post in the same year.

==Aftermath==
Upon arrival at Tegel, the two planes were immediately hidden in [[hangar]]s and journalists were prohibited from taking pictures of them.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; For years after, it was believed that the two planes had been repainted as aircraft of the [[United States Air Force]] and returned to West Germany by USAF pilots, or that they had been disassembled and transported back to the West in pieces.&lt;ref name="Tages" /&gt; The arrival of two massive [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|Douglas C-124]] at Tegel from [[Frankfurt am Main]] also fuelled speculations that the two F-84s would be transported back in these aircraft.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; Another theory (which turned out to be true) held that the two aircraft were hidden by the French authorities at Tegel and, later, buried at the airfield, where they were accidentally rediscovered in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burgmannschaft.info/forum/upload/showthread.php?t=1117 Luftraumverletzungen und -zwischenfälle über dem Gebiet der DDR]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{de icon}}, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In an exhibition at the ''[[Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr|Luftwaffenmuseum Berlin-Gatow]]'' in 2006, pictures of the two buried and then rediscovered Thunderstreaks at Tegel were shown, finally clearing up the question of what became of the two planes.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt;

The pilots of the two Thunderstreaks, Pfefferkorn and Eberl, were banned from flying and transferred to the ground crew at Lechfeld.&lt;ref name="Monat" /&gt; The F-84F Thunderstreak, in service with the ''Jagdbombergeschwader 32'' since inception of the unit on 22 July 1958, was phased out of service on 13 July 1966, the ''Geschwader'' having accumulated over 80,000 flight hours with the planes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/luftwaffe/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLNzKI9zAJBsmB2e5ezvqRcNGglFR9b31fj_zcVP0A_YLciHJHR0VFAN5emug!/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfMjBfT0tD?yw_contentURL=%2F01DB060000000001%2FW27G5DLE422INFODE%2Fcontent.jsp ''Jagdbombergeschwader 32'' website – History] {{de icon}} accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962 incident===
[[File:Hawker Sea Hawks of the West German Marineflieger in August 1958.jpg|thumb|right|Marineflieger-Geschwader 1]]
Eleven months after the F-84 incident, the Soviet threat of to shooting down any aircraft violating the border materialized when a [[Hawker Sea Hawk]] of the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'', piloted by [[Kapitänleutnant]] Knut Anton Winkler, was shot at by [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] fighters when it accidentally crossed into East German airspace near [[Eisenach]]. Winkler, who had been returning from a training exercise on board {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}} in the Atlantic Ocean, had to carry out an emergency landing at [[Ahlhorn]], 45&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name="Monat" /&gt; The aircraft was eventually written-off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.snafu.de/veith/seahawk.htm  DDR-Luftwaffe.de – Sea Hawk] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winkler himself died less than four years later in a [[F-104 Starfighter]] accident on 10 May 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cactus-starfighter-staffel.de/public/html/in_memoriam.html In Memoriam] List of German pilots killed in F-104 Starfighter accidents, accessed: 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4486">The '''2016 Saudi Arabian snowstorm''' was an [[Extreme weather|extreme weather event]] in late November 2016, in which parts of the [[Arabian Desert|Arabian desert]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] experienced subzero temperatures, snowfall and flooding. 

Snow was first reported in northern parts of Saudi Arabia on 23 November.

|[[WMGK]] Philadelphia morning host John DeBella, along with employer and WMGK owner [[Beasley Broadcasting]] and TTWN and its parent company iHeart Media, are named as defendants in a sexual harassment lawsuit against the parties by Jennifer Neill, who under the on-air name “Jen Posner”, was an employee of TTWN Media as a traffic reporter from 2000 to 2017. She started reporting traffic for DeBella’s show when he joined WMGK in 2002 and was promoted to co-host in 2010 where her TTWN employment was subcontracted to then WMGK owner [[Greater Media]]. According to the lawsuit, Neill claimed that DeBella forced himself on her at work repeatedly, made unwanted advances, and asked for sexual favors, while station management did nothing. She later filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission in September 2016 after which she was asked to return to work or take a leave of absence while an independent investigation was conducted (Neill did return for one show and left), but six weeks later after the investigation was completed she was never told of the details and was given the opportunity to return or resign, the latter of which she did in January 2017 after she was demoted to traffic reporter at TTWN.

The move will give WWKL a more powerful signal and expanded coverage at the [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]]-licensed 106.7 frequency, while at the same time alleviate an overlapping issue between WZCY-FM (who’ll occupy the [[Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania|Mechanicsburg]]-assigned 93.5 position) and sister [[WIOV-FM]], the latter serving the [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancasster]], [[York, Pennsylvania|York]], and [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] metropolitan areas.

"'''Angel'''" is a song by    Canadian  singer-songwriter [[Sarah McLachlan]] about the [[heroin]] [[overdose]] death of [[Jonathan Melvoin]] (1961-1996), the [[Smashing Pumpkins]] touring keyboard player, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/music/drugs-in-songs-17801.html|title=Drugs in Songs|publisher=Fun Trivia|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as McLachlan explained on ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]''. The song first appeared on ''[[Surfacing (album)|Surfacing]]'', the Canadian singer's 1997 album. It is sometimes mistitled as '''"In the Arms of an Angel"'''&lt;ref&gt;Ebony - Oct 2007 - Page 194 "He decided against killing himself while back in the United States after hearing on the radio Sarah McLachlan's song "In the Arms of an Angel." " and other examples&lt;/ref&gt; or '''"Arms of the Angel"'''.

"Angel" was McLachlan's second consecutive top five hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, debuting at number twelve, and then jumping to the top ten the following week, before peaking at number four. It remained at the top ten for nineteen weeks, and for twenty-nine weeks in the top 100. "Angel" was the eighteenth most successful song of 1999.

==Background==
"Angel" was one of the first songs written for ''[[Surfacing (album)|Surfacing]]''. McLachlan said that writing it was easy, "a real joyous occasion",&lt;ref name=CMJ /&gt; and that "the bulk of it came in about three hours."  It was inspired by articles that she read in ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' about musicians turning to [[heroin]] to cope with the pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISHRr29MaFs&amp;t=99 Sarah McLachlan explaining her inspiration to write 'Angel'] (interview discussing Surfacing CD, posted to YouTube on Dec 9, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CMJ /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spin /&gt; She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: "I've been in that place where you've messed up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape."&lt;ref name=CMJ /&gt; She said that the song is about "trying not to take responsibility for other people's problems and trying to love yourself at the same time".

The '''Anti-Terrorism Squad''' (ATS) is a special police force in several states of [[India]] including [[Maharashtra]], [[Gujarat]], [[Kerala]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Bihar]].&lt;ref name=bp&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarat Kumar appointed as Bihar ATS Chief|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/11/paresh-saxena-appointed-as-bihar-ats-chief/|work=Biharprabha News|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Maharashtra it is headed by senior IPS officer Vivek Phansalkar &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/06/12/stories/2009061259811400.htm "Maharashtra ATS gets new chief"] [[The Hindu]], 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The squad has stopped several terrorist attacks in the country.

ATS was founded in Maharashtra in 1990 by then Additional Commissioner of Mumbai Police [[Aftab Ahmed Khan]] popularly known as A.A. Khan. He was inspired by the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]'s Special Weapons &amp; Tactics ([[SWAT]]) teams methods to combat modern-day terrorism. Since its formation in 1990, ATS's officers have won 23 gallantry awards. The Mumbai ATS was involved in the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|26 November 2008 hostage rescue operations]] in multiple locations in [[Mumbai]], Maharashtra including the 5 star hotels [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj]] and [[Oberoi Trident]]. After the attacks, it also started appointing children (ages above 12) as officers of ATC, particularly in Mumbai, and were given training as undercover.

==Termination and reformation==
The ATS was formed on December 1990 and helped reduce the crime rate in Mumbai by 70%. However, there were many human rights violations by the squad, from extreme means of torture to public shootings. Following the [[1991 Lokhandwala Complex shootout]] on 16 November 1991 and many more encounters, the organization was terminated in January 1993. The leader of this program, A.A. Khan, was transferred as the ICP Anti Naxalite division to [[Nagpur]] on 29 January 1993 following the termination of the program. One month later on 12 March 1993 the [[1993 Bombay bombings|Bombay blasts]] occurred, and the crime rate has increased since then.

As per the information available on the official website of Mumbai Police, ATS was created by the Government of Maharashtra, vide G.R. No. SAS-10/03/15/SB-IV,
dated 8 July 2004&lt;ref name="MUMATS"&gt;[http://www.mumbaipolice.org/special/anit_terror_squad.htm "ANTI - TERRORISM SQUAD"] mumbaipolice.org retrieved on 27 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The stated objectives of ATS are:

# To gain information about anti-national elements working in any part of Maharashtra
# To co-ordinate with central information agencies like the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|IB]] and [[Research &amp; Analysis Wing|RAW]] and exchange information with them
# To co-ordinate with similar agencies of other states
# To track and eliminate activities of mafia and other organized crime syndicates
# To detect rackets of counterfeit currency notes and smuggling narcotic substances&lt;ref name="MUMATS" /&gt;

==Branches==
Several states in India have created ATS units in their respective police forces, including :
*[[Maharashtra]]
*[[Ahmedabad]], [[Gujarat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leena Misra |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-07-22/ahmedabad/27200264_1_anti-terror-cells-islamic-fundamentalism-gujarat-police |title=ATS to branch out to other cities in state - Ahmedabad - City - The Times of India |publisher=The Times of India |date=2003-07-22 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lucknow]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]
*[[Kerala]]
*[[Rajasthan]]
*[[Bihar]]
*[[Madhya Pradesh]]
*[[West Bengal]]

==1991 shootout at Lokhandwala==
On 16 November 1991 the ATS Chief, A.A. Khan, lead a squad of officers into the Swati building in [[Lokhandwala]], eliminating 7 gangsters including [[Maya Dolas]] and [[Dilip Buwa]]. The shootout lasted 4 hours and more than 450 rounds were fired.

==November 2008 Mumbai attacks==
The former ATS Chief [[Hemant Karkare]] was killed [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks|fighting terrorists]] on 26 November 2008, at the [[Cama Hospital|Cama &amp; Albless Hospital]] in the [[Dhobitalao]] area of Mumbai. Karkare was killed with other two officers: Additional Commissioner [[Ashok Kamte]] and [[Encounter killings|encounter specialist]] [[Vijay Salaskar]]. He was among the 14 police officials killed while fighting terrorists in Mumbai.

The terrorists had holed up in many heritage locations of Mumbai, such as the [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj Mahal Palace Hotel]] and [[Oberoi Trident|the Oberoi]] and [[Oberoi Trident|Trident, Nariman Point]] hotels. Here the terrorists had killed 146 people, wounded at least 327, and taken at least 15 people hostage. Indians accounted for 96 dead of those, and at least 300 of those injured.

Karkare, a 1982 batch IPS officer, had returned to his state cadre after a seven-year tenure with the [[Research and Analysis Wing]], India's external intelligence agency, in Austria.

==2009 shootout==
On 25 January 2009, after receiving a tip-off, ATS agents chased a [[Maruti 800]] car bearing a '[[Uttar Pradesh|UP]]' number-plate in [[Noida]]. During the chase, the terrorists shot at the police officers who retaliated, causing the car to hit the rear tyre of the suspects' car, veering it off the road. ATS officers then took cover behind a roadblock and engaged the terrorists for 38 minutes in a fierce gun-battle. Officer Vinod Kumar sustained a bullet injury during the gunfight. The two terrorists ceased firing after sustaining multiple gunshot wounds and succumbed to their injuries while they were rushed to the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videoshow/4029172.cms |title=Two alleged terrorists shot dead in Noida-News-Videos-The Times of India |publisher=The Times of India |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-01-25/india/28008871_1_ats-noida-police-car |title=Two suspected Pak terrorists shot dead in Noida - India - The Times of India |publisher=The Times of India |date=2009-01-25 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6857">In October 2008, '''Ashley Todd''', a volunteer for the [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|U.S. presidential campaign]] of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John McCain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view.bg?articleid=1127679&amp;srvc=2008campnews&amp;position=2|title=John McCain volunteer admits mugging story is lie|date=October 25, 2008|work=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; falsely claimed to have been the victim of [[robbery]] and politically motivated [[physical assault]] by a supporter of McCain's [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=McCain Campaign Volunteer Admits Alleged Attack Was a Hoax |url=http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/10/24/mccain-campaign-volunteer-admits-alleged-attack-hoax/ |work=[[Fox News]] |date=October 24, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story broke less than two weeks before the 2008 [[United States presidential election, 2008|United States presidential election]] on November 4. Todd later confessed to inventing the story after surveillance photos and a [[Polygraph|polygraph test]] were presented. She was charged with filing a false police report, and entered a probation program for first-time offenders.

==Initial claim and political commentary==
Todd had worked as a field representative for the [[College Republican National Committee]] since August 2008 and had come to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] in mid-October to recruit college students.&lt;ref name="ppg"&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, 2008, Todd claimed that she was robbed at knifepoint by a "six-foot-four [[African American]] of medium build, dressed in dark clothes wearing shiny shoes" at a Citizens Bank [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] in the [[Bloomfield (Pittsburgh)|Bloomfield]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh. She also alleged that after the robber saw a McCain [[bumper sticker]] on Todd's car, he assaulted her, cut a reversed letter ''B'' into her cheek,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kdka.com/video/?id=47866@kdka.dayport.com |title=Mugger Attacked Campaign Volunteer In Pittsburgh |publisher=KDKA Online |accessdate=2008-10-23 |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025075412/http://kdka.com/video?id=47866%40kdka.dayport.com |archivedate=October 25, 2008 }}

Todd's story received international attention, including prominent coverage on [[Drudge Report]] and [[Fox News]]. [[John Moody (journalist)|John Moody]], executive vice president at Fox News, commented in a [[blog]] on the network's website that "this incident could become a watershed event in the 11 days before the election," but also warned that "[i]f the incident turns out to be a hoax, Senator McCain's quest for the presidency is over, forever linked to [[race-baiting]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moody |first=John |url=http://foxforum.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/10/23/jmoody_1023/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029224415/http://foxforum.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/10/23/jmoody_1023 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2008-10-29 |work=Fox News |title=Moment of Truth |date=October 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoax exposure==
On October 24, Todd confessed to inventing the story after police reviewed [[surveillance camera]] photos and administered a [[polygraph]] test.&lt;ref name=KDKA2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kdka.com/local/attack.McCain.Bloomfield.2.847628.html |title=Police: Campaign Worker Admits Making Up Story |publisher=KDKA Online |accessdate=2008-10-23 |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025073658/http://kdka.com/local/attack.McCain.Bloomfield.2.847628.html |archivedate=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She now said that she had seen the backwards 'B' on her face while driving, and though she did not remember how she got it, assumed that she herself had done it because she had had previous episodes of [[memory loss]].&lt;ref name="ppg" /&gt;  According to police, Todd provided no explanation of why she provided them the story about the mugging instead.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27456042/
|title=McCain worker reaches deal in hoax assault
|work=MSNBC
|date=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd was charged with filing a false police report, a [[misdemeanor]] charge with a maximum [[jail sentence]] of two years. While jailed, Todd underwent a court-ordered psychiatric examination and was deemed to be competent to stand trial, but in need of further counseling. On October 30, she agreed to a deal in which she was released from jail, but must undergo [[psychiatric counseling]] as condition of her release. Upon her formal [[arraignment]] in January, Todd would enter a [[probation]] program for first-time offenders, after which her record would be expunged if there had been no further offenses. Continued mental health counseling would also be a condition of the probation period. The deal did not require Todd to enter a [[plea]].&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt;

==Prior claim by Todd==
According to an October 25, 2008 article in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', in February 2008, Todd had claimed that her car's tires had been slashed and campaign material had been stolen from her car because of her support for Republican politician [[Ron Paul]], an opponent of McCain for the Republican presidential nomination. Group leader Dustan Costine told the ''Post-Gazette'' that Todd was asked to leave the local Ron Paul grassroots group a month later, after she posed as a [[Mike Huckabee]] supporter and called the local Republican committee seeking information about its campaign strategies.&lt;ref name="ppg"/&gt;

{{Campaignbox Berber separatism in North Africa}}
'''Berber separatism in North Africa''' refers to a century-long independence struggle of ethnic [[Berbers|Berber]] groups in the areas of modern [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Mali]] and [[Libya]]. The first chapter of this modern separatism was embodied in the [[Rif War]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zs4uw9Uw1C0C&amp;pg=PA46 White Gypsies: Race and Stardom in Spanish Musical Films - Eva Woods Peiró&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eSWDAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Rif+Independence+Movement%22&amp;dq=%22Rif+Independence+Movement%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0PFlU6L_O8O-oQTlkIG4Dw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg What the Arabs think - William Roe Polk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the creation of short-lived [[Rif Republic]] (1920–1926). Despite the disintegration of this Berber state, the independence movement continued during the 20th century in Algeria and in 21st century was led by [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] tribes in Mali and Libya (the failed attempt to form the [[Azawad]] state within Mali in 2012 and ''de facto'' formation of [[Tuareg militias of Ghat|Tuareg autonomy of Ghat]] within Libya since 2014), and last resurging in Morocco in 2013,&lt;ref name="OEAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/155144338/The-Rif-Independence-Movement-Joins-OEAS|title=The Rif Independence Movement Joins OEAS|website=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt; escalating into a Berber protest movement in 2016–17.

==Timeline==
===Rif War===
The [[Rif War]] was an armed conflict fought during the first half of the 1920s between the colonial power [[History of Spain|Spain]] (later joined by [[History of France|France]]) and the [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes of the [[Rif]] mountainous region. Led by [[Abd el-Krim|Abd al-Karim]], the Riffians at first inflicted several defeats on the Spanish forces by using [[guerrilla tactics]] and captured European weapons. After France's entry into the conflict and the major landing of Spanish troops at [[Alhucemas landing|Al Hoceima]], considered the first amphibious landing in history to involve the use of [[tank]]s and [[aircraft]], Abd el-Karim surrendered to the French and was taken into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Porch, "Spain's African Nightmare," ''MHQ: Quarterly Journal of Military History'' (2006) 18#2 pp 28–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the Rif War is still controversial among historians today. Some see in it a harbinger of the decolonization process in North Africa, while others, on the contrary, see it as one of the last colonial wars, given that it is the decision of the Spaniards to conquer the Rif — nominally part of their Moroccan protectorate but still independent de facto — that launched the conflict in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cairn.info/revue-strategique-2009-1-page-319.htm  Jan Pascal, ''L’Armée française face à Abdelkrim ou la tentation de mener une guerre conventionnelle dans une guerre irrégulière 1924-1927''], Cairn.Info, 2009, p. 732.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1958 Rif disturbances===
In 1958, Moroccan King Hassan II ordered thousands of troops to the Rif region to quell a civil disobedience movement that had called for social and political rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2017/06/morocco-fuelling-unrest-rif-170601141849532.html|title=Morocco: What is fuelling unrest in the Rif?|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many left the Rif for Europe in search of a better life, returning to their ancestral towns only to build homes that they lived in during vacations or after retirement. This, along with the diversion of much of the region's arable land for cannabis planting, has decimated the local economy and environment.

===Kabylie movement===
====Berber Spring (1980)====
The [[Berber Spring]] was a period of political protest and civil activism in 1980 claiming recognition of the [[Berber people|Berber]] identity and language in [[Algeria]], with events mainly taking place in [[Kabylie]] and [[Algiers]]. The background was marked by two decades of harsh [[Arabization]] measures instituted by the [[Arab nationalist]] [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] dictatorship government, which refused to recognize Algeria's Berber identity and banned the [[Berber language]] altogether.

The Berber Spring is traditionally dated as beginning on March 10, 1980, with the banning of a conference due to be held by the Kabyle intellectual [[Mouloud Mammeri]] at Hasnaoua University in [[Tizi-Ouzou]]. A critical point was the coordinated arrest of hundreds of Berber activists, students and doctors on April 20, sparking a [[general strike]].

While the Berber Spring was in the end violently suppressed by the Algerian authorities, it created a lasting legacy for Kabylie and the Berbers across North Africa. Many of today's prominent Kabyle politicians and activists made their name during the Berber Spring events, and organizations such as the [[Rally for Culture and Democracy]] (RCD) and the Berber Cultural Movement (Mouvement Culturel Berbère – MCB) were later created by activists of the Spring. The Spring was also an important event for Algeria's nascent human rights community, including outside Berber circles.

Since the dismantling of the one-party FLN system in 1989—followed by abortive [[democratization]] and [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]]—a few of the demands of the Berber Spring have been met by the state, and the Berber language is now a [[national language]] of Algeria. However, this is still distinct from [[Arabic]], which remains the [[official language]], and many other points of contention remain.

====2014–15 ethnic clashes====
In 2014 and 2015 a number of ethnic riot incidents plagued Algeria, with a dozen mortal casualties in violence between ethnic Arabs and Berbers.

====2017 protests====
In February 2017, protests erupted in Algeria, with some 500 protesters marching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-algeria-protest-idUSTRE71I15U20110219|title=Hundreds of protesters defy police in Algeria|date=19 February 2011|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest was organized by human rights groups, some trade unionists and a small opposition party. Algeria's main opposition forces were not taking part. Large numbers of police had been mobilized to try to prevent the protest from going ahead. Police at the protest detained Belaid Abrika, a prominent opposition figure and campaigner for the rights of Algeria's large Berber minority.

===Azawad===

===Libyan Civil War===

===Berber protests in Morocco===
Since 2013 the Rif Independence Movement resurged in Morocco.&lt;ref name="OEAS"/&gt; Rif Independence Movement is a charter member of the Organization of Emerging African States.&lt;ref name="OEAS"/&gt;

Since late 2016, massive riots have spread across Moroccan Berber communities in the Rif region, initiated after a death of a fishmonger in Al-Hoceima in October 2016. On 31 October, massive demonstrations took place across Morocco, staged by the Berber minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/morocco-protests-after-fisherman-crushed-to-death-in-a-garbage-truck|title=Morocco protests after fisherman crushed to death in a garbage truck|first=Associated|last=Press|date=31 October 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; During January and February 2017, the riots intensified and were marked by unemployment concerns, with around thirty police officers injured in the north Moroccan town of al-Hoceima, after tear gas and rubber bullets were deployed against thousands of mostly young protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/2/7/berber-nationalist-protests-break-out-in-al-hoceima-north-morocco|title=Berber nationalist protests break out in al-Hoceima, north Morocco|first=Robert|last=Cusack|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another escalation took place in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/morocco-police-hunt-rif-region-protest-leader-170527140125639.html|title=Morocco police hunt Rif region protest leader|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were led by Nasser Zefzafi, founder of the Al-Hirak al-Shaabi, or the Popular Movement.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/morocco-protests-2017-nasser-zefzafi-618731|title=“We are all Zefzafi”—who is the Morocco protest leader causing problems for the king?|date=2017-06-01|work=Newsweek|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zefzafi was arrested by Moroccan Police in late May 2017. Thousands took to the streets in Al-Hoceima since Zefzafi’s arrest, and demonstrations have also spread to the capital Rabat and Casablanca. Demonstrators proclaimed “We are all Zefzafi” and waved Berber flags, with around 40 people arrested.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt; By 30 May, the number of arrested protesters reached 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/scores-arrested-connection-morocco-rif-protests-170530184329431.html|title=Scores arrested in connection with Morocco Rif protests|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sikkim]] the [[Tashiding Monastery]] is recognized as a sacred place. It is believed that this place, Dakkar Tashiding in the center of four sacred caves, Sharchog Bephug in the east, Khandozangphu in the south, Dechenphug in the west and Lhari Nyingphug in the north, is meant to free you from the suffering of hell. At the start of the year the vase is opened and the Lama or monk determines the future. “If the water is to the brim, it foretells a year in which peace and prosperity will prevail. If the water is over the brim and is spilling, it signifies a year with natural disaster and disturbances. If the water level is low or almost dry it signifies famine.” The celebration of “The Holy Water Vase” started under the rule of [[Trisong Deutson|King Trisong Deutsonin]] Tibet, [[Padmasambhava|Guru Padmasambhava]].” It is believed that the water overflowed from the vase as a sign of a good omen and there was an earthquake. The four guardian deities of Dharma and the gods of thirty three heavens showered flowers from the sky.” This ritual is one of the holiest in Sikkim. From midnight until the next day thousands are seen waiting to receive the holy water. “A part of the holy water is distributed amongst the gathering of devotes and the pot is replenished with river water and sealed at the end of the festival to be opened only in the during next Bumchu festival.” It is said that by taking a drop of the Bumchu water enlightenment is achieved and all of the evil spirits and distress are removed. It is said one would somehow attain a form of Buddhahood or be born at a higher ranking in the next life. In 2016, it will be on March 19-20.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.travel-sikkim.com/event/Bhumchu&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction''' (BIFR) was an agency of the [[Government of India]], part of the Department of Financial Services of the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]]. Set up in January 1987 by the [[Rajiv Gandhi government]], its objective was to determine [[Industrial sickness|sickness of industrial companies]] and to assist in reviving those that may be viable and shutting down the others.{{sfn|Brief Introduction}} On 1 December 2016, the [[Modi government]] dissolved BIFR and referred all proceedings to the [[National Company Law Tribunal]] (NCLT) and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) as per provisions of [[Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 repealed and BIFR/ AIFR dissolved|url=https://www.pwc.in/assets/pdfs/news-alert-tax/2016/pwc_news_alert_1_december_2016_sick_industrial_companies_act_1985_repealed_and_bifr-aifr_dissolved.pdf|publisher=PWC|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The BIFR was established under The Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (SICA).
The board was set up in January 1987 and became functional as of 15 May 1987.{{sfn|Brief Introduction}}
A new industrial policy was tabled in Parliament on 24 July 1991 aiming to maintain growth in productivity and gainful employment and to encourage the growth of entrepreneurship and upgrades to technology.{{sfn|Reddy|2004|p=42-43}}
That year the SICA was amended to include public sector enterprises in the board's purview.{{sfn|Jain|Trehan|Trehan|2008|p=187}}

The [[Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002|Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act of 2002]] placed corporate debt outside the purview of the BIFR.{{sfn|Pathak|2011|p=515}}
By preventing reference to the BIFR, which had become a haven for the promoters of sick companies, the Act gives banks and financial institutions a better tool for recovering bad debt.
It was complemented by the corporate debt restructuring package under which lenders and borrowers would meet to agree on a way of recasting stressed debt.{{sfn|Pathak|2011|p=519}}

[[National Company Law Tribunal]] (NCLT) and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) would take over the functions of the BIFR and other bodies and speed up the process of winding down sick companies. The Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2001 was introduced because the government considered that the BIFR had not met its objective of preventing industrial sickness.{{sfn|Luthra|2005|p=241}}
The Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003 replaced SICA and sought to dissolve the BIFR and the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (AAIFR), replacing them by the NCLT and NCLAT. However, legal hurdles prevented the NCLT from being constituted.{{sfn|Kazmi|2008|p=220}}

==Structure and objectives==
The Board has a Chairman and from two to fourteen other members, all to be qualified as High Court judges or else to have at least fifteen years of relevant professional experience.{{sfn|The Sick Industrial Companies|p=6}}
The Board only handles large or medium-sized sick industrial companies in which large amounts have been sunk.{{sfn|Jain|Trehan|Trehan|2008|p=187}} 
Under the Sick Industrial Companies Act, the Board of a sick industrial company is legally obliged to report it to the BIFR, and the BIFR has the power to make whatever inquiries are needed to determine if the company is in fact sick.{{sfn|Reddy|2004|p=79}}

Among other objectives the act was to provide a way to revive sick industrial companies and release public funds.{{sfn|Pathak|2011|p=514}}
If a company is found to be sick, the BIFR can give the company reasonable time to regain health (bring total assets above total liabilities) or it can recommend other measures.{{sfn|Reddy|2004|p=79}}
The board can take other actions including changes to management, amalgamation of the sick unit with a healthy one, sale or financial reconstruction.{{sfn|Jain|Trehan|Trehan|2008|p=187}}
The Board can recommend a sick industrial company for winding up.{{sfn|The Sick Industrial Companies|p=18}}

The BIFR was intended to bridge the legal gap between sickness and revival.
It would impose time schedules for revival related activities to be completed, 
oversee their implementation and conduct periodic reviews of sick accounts.
The BIFR would provide a forum for sharing views, coordinating effort and developing a unified approach to dealing with sick companies, speeding up the start of corrective action.{{sfn|Balan|1996|p=110-111}}
The BIFR was meant to either turn companies around within six months or order closure.{{sfn|Baijal|2008|p=203}}

==Activity and results==

By the end of March 1991, the BIFR had registered 1020 cases and heard 954.
175 were dismissed as not maintainable, and 124 were approved for the company to try to become net-worth positive on their own.
Of the other 661 cases, the board sanctioned 182 revival plans and recommended that 120 cases be wound up.{{sfn|Balan|1996|p=5}}
Up to the end of 2007, the BIFR had registered 5,471 references with 1,337 being recommended for winding up and 825 revival schemes being sanctioned.{{sfn|Jain|Trehan|Trehan|2008|p=188}}
There were 66 sick Public Sector Enterprises registered with the board as of the end of March 2008, of which the government had approved 34 for revival.{{sfn|Trehan &amp; Trehan|p=152}}

BIFR has had mixed success. Some examples of successful recoveries are the recovery of [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]] in the 1980s, and more recently{{When|date=May 2012}} the turnaround of [[Arvind Mills]], [[Scooters India]] and the North Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation.
There have been many more cases where attempts to revive the companies failed, including [[Binny and Co.]], [[Calico Mills]], [[Guest Keen Williams]], [[Hindustan Cables]], [[Metal Box Company]] and [[Wyman Gordon]].{{sfn|Kazmi|2008|p=220-221}} Problems have included insufficient resources, delays and lack of political willingness to take tough decisions.{{sfn|Farazmand|2001|p=538}}
The BIFR in practice often became a way of prolonging the life of unviable companies for years at taxpayer expense.{{sfn|Baijal|2008|p=203}}

According to former [[Telecom Regulatory Authority of India]] (TRAI) chief [[Pradip Baijal]], the board "was created to deal with the change in status quo outside government and given a quasi-judicial structure, to act in favour of public good, but has perhaps joined the tribe of numerous rent-seekers in the public ownership structure".{{sfn|Baijal|2008|p=204}}
Discussing [[MS Shoes]], whose reference was registered by BIFR on 22.2.2002. The productions and export turnover of MS Shoes increased from Rs.25 crores to Rs.171.93 crores. The company came up with public issues which were over subscribed by more than 50 times the company attempted for 5 star hotel land and ready built guest house complex at Hudco Place, New Delhi for deluxe 5 star hotel and 4 star hotel. The reasons of sickness was devolvement of public issue of February,1995 and cancellation as well as forfeiture by Hudco of the amount paid by MS Shoes.&lt;ref name=order&gt;http://bifr.nic.in/asp/sopupload/237_2002_25102013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Nirmala Ganapathy said: "One look at the track record of BIFR, and it doesn’t take a {{sic|whiz}} to conclude that it is nothing but a graveyard of companies. A tiny fraction comes out healthy — only if the promoter is interested in putting it back up on its feet".{{sfn|Ganapathy|2003}} The BIFR approved the revival scheme of the company as the promoters brought in Rs. 41.20 crores as on 31.3.2011 and Rs. 22.08 crores as loan to the company to be converted into equity shares further approving the promoters contribution to be converted into equity by increasing authorised capital from existing Rs. 90 crores to Rs. 200 crores. The promoters brought up the company to its healthy situation since the promoters were interested in putting the company back up on its feet.&lt;ref name="order" /&gt;

'''Brighton Hippodrome''' is an entertainment venue in the ancient centre of [[Brighton]], part of the English city of [[Brighton and Hove]]. It has been empty and out of use since 2007, when its use as a [[Bingo (Commonwealth)|bingo hall]] ceased.

From its construction in 1897 it has hosted an ice rink, circus acts, [[Variety show|variety theatre]], [[vaudeville]] shows and bands such as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]]. The flamboyantly decorated interior, with a large auditorium and [[Rococo]] embellishments, survives despite the frequent alterations; but in July 2010 its owner announced that it would cost £9 million to restore the building and convert it into a live music venue, and a [[charitable trust]] expressed concern over its future. Since 2011, several plans have been submitted to convert the building for alternative uses.  [[English Heritage]] has [[Listed building|listed]] the building at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance.

==History==
By the end of the 19th century, Brighton had been a fashionable and thriving [[seaside resort]], which had experienced rapid growth, for more than 100 years.  It developed around the medieval fishing village of Brighthelmstone—a grid of streets running inland from the sea, intercut with narrow [[Alley|twittens]].  Middle Street, the most important and central of these streets, was built up from the 16th century, and was lined with houses both large and small, inns, the town's oldest school and a [[Middle Street Synagogue, Brighton|richly decorated synagogue]].&lt;ref name="Antram75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=75.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEB173"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=173.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HAoB14–15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dale|1950|pp=14&amp;ndash;15.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land on the east side of the street was chosen as the site of the Real Ice Skating Rink in 1897.  It was designed by the architect Lewis Karslake and had a long [[stucco]]ed façade with short towers at each end.&lt;ref name="Antram77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=77.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The venture was unsuccessful, as ice-skating did not gain popularity; and in 1900, the owners converted the venue into a circus.  [[Frank Matcham]], a prolific theatre architect, was engaged to enlarge and rebuild the interior.&lt;ref name="BoB39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brighton Polytechnic. School of Architecture and Interior Design|1987|p=39.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was renamed ''The Hippodrome'' and reopened in its new form in 1901.  The following year the circus failed and the site was auctioned. It was bought by theatre entrepreneur [[Thomas Barrasford]]&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/56527|title=Oxford DNB article: Barrasford, Thomas|last=Russell|first=Dave|year=2004|work=[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/56527|accessdate=1 December 2010}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; who modified the auditorium, replacing the circus ring with seating, and on 22 December 1902 the Hippodrome reopened as a [[Variety show|variety theatre]].&lt;ref name="Antram77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEB335"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=335.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrasford died at the venue in February 1910 and the Hippodrome was sold to the Variety Theatres Controlling Company (VTCC). It quickly became Brighton's most important variety theatre.&lt;ref name="NEB335"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Musgrave311"/&gt;  Shows of all types were staged there, and top-name entertainers such as [[Harry Houdini]], [[W C Fields]], [[Lillie Langtry]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Gracie Fields]], [[Laurel and Hardy]] and [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] appeared.&lt;ref name="BoB39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Argus-8624311"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/yesterdays/past_present/8624311.Home_of_the_stars/ |title=Home of the stars |last=Trimingham |first=Adam |date=8 November 2010 |work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]] |publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]] |accessdate=27 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QeaU24tB?url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/yesterdays/past_present/8624311.Home_of_the_stars/ |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Laurence Olivier]] made his professional stage début—but fell over on his first entrance.&lt;ref name="BoB39"/&gt;  One of [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s first roles was a bit-part in theatre impresario [[Fred Karno]]'s comedy ''Saturday to Monday'', staged in May 1907;&lt;ref name="Musgrave359"&gt;{{Harvnb|Musgrave|1981|p=359.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vivien Leigh]] gave an acclaimed performance in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[The Doctor's Dilemma (play)|The Doctor's Dilemma]]'' in January 1942.&lt;ref name="Musgrave311"&gt;{{Harvnb|Musgrave|1981|p=311.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local stars also featured: [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]], the Brighton-born [[music hall]] entertainer and comedian, appeared on many occasions between 1928 and 1960;&lt;ref name="NEB335"/&gt; and [[conjoined twins]] [[Daisy and Violet Hilton]], whose [[vaudeville]] career began in their home town in 1911 at the age of three, topped the bill with their variety show.&lt;ref name="NEB148"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=148.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue's early success led to expansion. In 1919 the lower floors of the two houses on the north side,&lt;ref name="NEB335"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHLE-1381793"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1381793|desc=Mecca Bingo, Nos. 52–58 (consecutive) Middle Street (east side), Brighton, Brighton and Hove, East Sussex|grade=II*|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as Hippodrome House since Barrasford made his home there in 1902, was converted into a Palm Court for teas and dances. Its maximum capacity may have been up to 3,000 although an attendance of 4,500 was recorded on one occasion.&lt;ref name="Argus-8624311"/&gt; Further changes of ownership in 1928 and 1932 made the Hippodrome part of the [[Moss Empires]] circuit.

After World War II, the popularity of variety theatre waned,&lt;ref name="NEB335"/&gt; and the new practice of centralised booking of productions by an agency in London meant that the tastes of Brighton audiences were not specifically catered for: the venue typically received shows that had toured around the country and had no local connection.&lt;ref name="Musgrave311"/&gt;  The Hippodrome accordingly hosted concerts and other large-scale events: concerts by [[The Beatles]] (part of their [[The Beatles' 1964 world tour|1964 World Tour]]) and [[The Rolling Stones]] (on their [[The Rolling Stones 4th British Tour 1964|4th British Tour 1964]]) in October 1964.&lt;ref name="NEB335"/&gt;  This could not stop the decline, though, and on 22 November 1964 the theatre was closed. Brighton Corporation considered acquisition but the idea lapsed. In 1966 it was converted into a short-lived television and film studio.&lt;ref name="NEB335"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Musgrave311"/&gt;  In 1967, it was turned into a [[The Rank Group#Mecca Bingo|Mecca Bingo]] hall;&lt;ref name="NEB335"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Musgrave311"/&gt; the conversion work included the insertion of a raised floor above the stage and through the [[proscenium]] arch.&lt;ref name="Antram77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHLE-1381793"/&gt; Mecca was bought by the [[Rank Organisation]] in 1990.

[[File:Former Hippodrome, Brighton (Glazed Awning over Entrance).jpg|thumb|left|The glazed awning spans the façade.  The three-arched main entrance is visible below this section.]]
Repairs were carried out on the coloured glass awnings above the entrance in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Antram77"/&gt;  The building closed as a bingo hall in August 2006 and is still empty as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.&lt;ref name="NEB335"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Argus-8624311"/&gt;  In 2003, property investment firm London Merchant Securities (later called Cheval Properties) bought it and leased it to [[Academy Music Group]] (AMG), who planned to work with events company [[Live Nation Entertainment|Live Nation]] to establish a live music venue in it.&lt;ref name="NEB335"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Argus-8278223"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/8278223.Brighton_Hippodrome_on_danger_list/ |title=Brighton Hippodrome on danger list |last=Loomes |first=Naomi |date=17 July 2010 |work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]] |publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]] |accessdate=27 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QeaU43BJ?url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/8278223.Brighton_Hippodrome_on_danger_list/ |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2010, AMG announced that this would probably cost at least £9 million: suitable soundproofing in the narrow, partly residential street would cost about £3 million, and the deteriorating structural condition meant repair work would be difficult and expensive.  Initial analysis work cost £{{frac|1|2}} million.&lt;ref name="Argus-8278223"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BHBF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20100718.126101.htm |title=Hippodrome refurbishment bill could be over £9m |date=18 July 2010 |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Business Forum |accessdate=27 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QeaU5oG6?url=http://www.brightonbusiness.co.uk/htm/ni20100718.126101.htm |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Theatres Trust]], the statutory advisory body on theatre conservation, placed the Hippodrome on its register of "buildings requiring special attention"&lt;ref name="Argus-8278223"/&gt; in 2009; on a list of 82 theatres in Britain, it was placed in the top ten at highest risk.&lt;ref name="TTT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/news/show/894-four-sites-join-theatre-at-risk-list |title=Four sites join theatre "at risk" list |date=24 June 2009 |publisher=The Theatres Trust |accessdate=27 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QeaU8Ode?url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/news/show/894-four-sites-join-theatre-at-risk-list |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was number one on the list in 2013 and the following three years.&lt;ref name="TTT2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/news/show/6438-unique-circus-theatre-brighton-hippodrome-tops-theatre-buildings-at-risk-register-2014|title=Unique circus theatre, Brighton Hippodrome, tops Theatre Buildings at Risk Register 2014|date=18 September 2009|publisher=The Theatres Trust|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brighton and Hove City Council]] stated in October 2011 that AMG had met officers from the licensing and planning departments in an attempt to move the situation forward.&lt;ref name="Argus-9283052"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9283052.Talks_on_plans_to_re_open_Brighton_Hippodrome/ |title=Talks on plans to re-open Brighton Hippodrome |last=Ridgway |first=Tim |date=3 October 2011 |work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]] |publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]] |accessdate=27 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QeaU9vqM?url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9283052.Talks_on_plans_to_re_open_Brighton_Hippodrome/ |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four months later, Live Nation announced its intention to seek [[planning permission]] to convert the building into "one of the city’s main live music venues", at an estimated cost of £9 million.  By this time the company had spent at least £100,000 on structural and other surveys.&lt;ref name="Argus-9553655"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9553655.Brighton_Hippodrome_restoration_moves_closer/ |title=Brighton Hippodrome restoration moves closer |last=Evans |first=Rebecca |date=25 February 2012 |work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]] |publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]] |accessdate=27 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QeaUCRXJ?url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9553655.Brighton_Hippodrome_restoration_moves_closer/ |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nothing came of these plans, though, and in February 2013 another group—Alaska Development Consultants—unveiled an £18 million plan to turn the Hippodrome into an eight-screen cinema.  Five new shops and a public square would be part of the plans, and the building would be connected to an adjacent shopping arcade.  Local firm Russ Drage Architects drew up the plans.&lt;ref name="Argus-10369705"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10369705.Brighton_Hippodrome_to_become_a_cinema/ |title=Brighton Hippodrome to become a cinema |last=Ridgway |first=Tim |date=21 April 2013 |work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]] |publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]] |accessdate=27 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QeaUFSX8?url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10369705.Brighton_Hippodrome_to_become_a_cinema/ |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A local and national campaign, preferring the building to be used for live theatre or similar events, protested against the plans; but by January 2014 Alaska Development Consultants' proposals had evolved into a £35 million scheme including a restaurant on a removable floor above the auditorium.&lt;ref name="Argus-10934552"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10934552.__35m_scheme_for_historic_Hippodrome_theatre_in_Brighton_unveiled/ |title=£35m scheme for historic Hippodrome theatre in Brighton unveiled |date=14 January 2014 |work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]] |publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]] |accessdate=27 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QeaUHYfN?url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10934552.__35m_scheme_for_historic_Hippodrome_theatre_in_Brighton_unveiled/ |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[English Heritage]] announced their support for these plans in April 2014,&lt;ref name="Argus-11134457"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/11134457.Controversial_Brighton_Hippodrome_cinema_plans_get_English_Heritage_backing/ |title=Controversial Brighton Hippodrome cinema plans get English Heritage backing |date=9 April 2014 |work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]] |publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]] |accessdate=27 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QeaUKMAX?url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/11134457.Controversial_Brighton_Hippodrome_cinema_plans_get_English_Heritage_backing/ |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 2014 the city council's planning department gave final approval.&lt;ref name="Argus-11344869"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/11344869.Historic_Brighton_theatre_set_to_become_eight_screen_cinema_complex/|title=Historic Brighton Hippodrome is set to become an eight screen cinema complex following city council planners approval|date=16 July 2014|last=Vowles|first=Neil|work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]|publisher=[[Newsquest|Newsquest Media Group]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site, together with the contiguous Dukes Lane shopping street, was immediately put on the market.

==Architecture==
[[File:Former Hippodrome, Brighton (Cartouche with Putti).jpg|thumb|right|Elaborate scrollwork and [[Putto|putti]] decorate the [[Cartouche (design)|cartouches]] above the outer entrances.]]
The exterior of the former Hippodrome is in three parts and is [[stucco]]ed, but there is apparently brickwork, [[terracotta]] and stone underneath.  The original (1897) section is symmetrical, but the extension northwards in 1939 took in two houses which make the composition unbalanced.&lt;ref name="Antram77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHLE-1381793"/&gt;  The central section has a stepped [[pediment]] above a [[dentil]] cornice and a rectangular panel with the letters {{smallcaps|hippodrome}} projecting.  Below this, a three-part awning projects as a [[lean-to]], forming a low roof.&lt;ref name="Antram77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHLE-1381793"/&gt;  This obscures the centre [[Bay (architecture)|bay]], which has three arches with entrances below.  The middle entrance has a porch flanked by [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]] [[pilaster]]s and topped by an [[entablature]] with a pulvinated (convex) [[frieze]].  The arch has a decorative [[archivolt]].&lt;ref name="NHLE-1381793"/&gt;  Between the porch and the two plain outer entrances in the centre bay are single straight-headed windows divided into two lights by a single [[mullion]].&lt;ref name="NHLE-1381793"/&gt;

A pair of short towers stand alongside the centre bay.  They each have a simple straight-headed entrance with pilasters, a [[cornice]] and a [[pediment]] at ground-floor level, and two more windows and a door above.  A wide dentil cornice runs around each tower, and on the inside an extra section projects inwards and upwards beyond the cornice line.  Elaborate single-storey entrance bays flank the towers, with [[chamfer]]ed arches, ornate [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]], [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] and a [[cornice]].  Above the frieze is a scroll-moulded [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]] which is framed by the upper sections of the columns.&lt;ref name="NHLE-1381793"/&gt;

Inside, much of Frank Matcham's original work remains, and the design is considered to be one of his finest&lt;ref name="BoB39"/&gt; and to display "his hallmark decorative richness".&lt;ref name="Antram77"/&gt;  A narrow foyer leads to an [[auditorium]] shaped like a horseshoe, with seats arranged in a circle around it and in front of the stage.  Above this is a [[proscenium]] arch featuring elaborate [[Rococo]]-style moulded plasterwork showing dolphins and female figures, and with [[egg-and-dart]] decoration to the [[architrave]].&lt;ref name="Antram77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHLE-1381793"/&gt;  Above the auditorium is an intricately patterned dome,&lt;ref name="BoB39"/&gt; and there are [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-Saracenic-style]] [[onion dome]]s on top of the two-part stage-boxes—evoking the style of the nearby [[Royal Pavilion]].&lt;ref name="Antram77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHLE-1381793"/&gt;  The stage and proscenium arch are now partly obscured by the new floor inserted in 1967.&lt;ref name="Antram77"/&gt;  More Rococo decoration is found on the panelled segmented ceiling, from which a large lantern also hangs.&lt;ref name="NHLE-1381793"/&gt;  The newer rooms on the northern side, all decorated in an elaborate Middle Eastern style, include a conservatory and bars.&lt;ref name="Antram77"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3011">[[File:Cern ritual.jpg|thumb|Frame from the video depicting men in cloaks gathered around the statue of Shiva]]
The '''CERN ritual''' is a video that depicts an alleged occult ritual occurring in the grounds of [[CERN]], a European particle physics research organization. The video shows several people dressed in black cloaks surrounding a statue of the Hindu deity [[Shiva]] and apparently stabbing a woman in a mock human sacrifice. The video ended with the person filming crying out and running away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/18/fake-human-sacrifice-filmed-at-cern-with-pranking-scientists-suspected|title=Fake human sacrifice filmed at Cern, with pranking scientists suspected|last=Staff and agencies in Geneva|date=2016-08-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video went viral in August 2016 in mockery of the many [[conspiracy theories]] concerning CERN. CERN later stated in its FAQ that the video was "fiction" and the actions violated its professional guidelines, as would indeed a real ritual sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cern-devil-worship-sacrifice-video_us_57b6856ce4b00d9c3a16cd67|title=Video Of 'Satanic Ritual' At World's Most Famous Physics Lab Is A Hoax|last=Mazza|first=Ed|date=2016-08-19|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
A CERN spokesperson stated that the video was a hoax and that no one was actually harmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a22429/cern-human-sacrifice-prank/|title=CERN Scientists Under Investigation After Fake Human Sacrifice|date=2016-08-18|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment was performed without any official permission. CERN stated that it "doesn't tolerate this kind of spoof" and that it can "give rise to misunderstandings about the scientific nature of our work”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/cern-human-sacrifice-video-watch-hadron-collider-god-particle-a7196881.html|title=Video shows ‘human sacrifice’ taking place at home of the God Particle|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video caused controversy both by creating mockery of existing theories and by fueling existing conspiracy theories about CERN activities. Given that the ritual was performed in front of a statue of a deity, some believed the ritual was satanic in nature. This further fueled theories that CERN's goal was to use their [[Large Hadron Collider]] to create a portal to hell, summon the [[antichrist]], or resurrect the ancient gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=LaCapria |first1=Kim |title=Fact Check Fauxtography Was a Human Sacrifice Captured at CERN? |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/human-sacrifice-captured-at-cern/ |website=Snopes.com |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cable 1971''', otherwise known as '''Priority Signal''' or '''File 1971''' was a high profile and secret [[Signals intelligence|military signal]] communicated between the two main [[Military of Pakistan|inter-services]] branches of Pakistan–the [[Pakistan Army]] and the [[Pakistan Navy]].&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shabbir|first1=Usman|title=Submarine Operations: Cable 1971|url=http://pakdef.org/submarine-operations/|website=pakdef.org|publisher=PakDef Military Consortium|accessdate=10 December 2016|location=Islamabad|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Roy"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roy |first1=Mihir K. |title=War in the Indian Ocean |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tqr8r7EB18wC&amp;pg=PA219 |publisher=Lancer Publishers |isbn=978-1-897829-11-0 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|219}} The [[Military signals|military cable]] was directed through the [[Naval Intelligence (Pakistan)|Naval Intelligence]] and [[Military Intelligence (Pakistan)|Military Intelligence]] to [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] sent on December 1952 to its [[Inter-Services Intelligence#Headquarters|headquarter]].&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium"/&gt;

The [[Military communications|cable]]  came in the wake of reactionary of [[Basic Principles Committee]]'s first report towards the writing of the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|first set]] of the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium"/&gt; The cable was sent by then-[[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Syed Mohammad Ahsan|S.M. Ahsan]] to [[Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence|DG ISI]] [[Major-General]] [[Robert Cawthome|R. Cawthome]] on a file coincidentally numbered 1971.&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt; The cable discussed the implication of [[One Unit]], [[Religious discrimination in Pakistan|religious fanaticism]], and the economic parity between the [[West Pakistan|West]] and [[East Pakistan]] that will ultimately result in the division of Pakistan into two different groups.&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Roy"/&gt;{{rp|219–220}}

The Cable's message read as:
* The creation of Committee of Ulema to veto the decisions taken in the House of People on religious matters, gives excess of powers to Ulema over the rights of elected representatives of the people. This gives an impression of Pakistan as being a Theocratic State.&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Roy"/&gt;{{rp|219–220}}
* To recommend that the head of the state should be a Muslim will unnecessarily create suspicions in minds of the minorities in Pakistan. The choice to select the head of the state should be left entirely to the people, to select without prejudice to caste, colour and creed.&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Roy"/&gt;{{rp|219–220}}
* It is maintained by same officers that a single House elected on population basis should have been envisaged, and we should cease to think in terms of Bengalis and Punjabis etc. The parity between West &amp; East Pakistan will ultimately result in the division of Pakistan into two different groups, therefore, it is the very negation of one people, one country and one culture.&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt;

The cable's message was further extended and discussed at the [[GHQ (Pakistan Army)|Army GHQ]] by MI's officer Major [[Khalid Mahmud Arif|KM Arif]] when he compiled an "Intelligence Report No. 7894 of the Office of Intelligence Research and Analysis" in December 1970.&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt;

The cable is notable for its [[Headline|highlighted title]] and many historians found strange that the cable was coincidentally numbered: '''Cable/File 1971'''.&lt;ref name="PakDef Military Consortium" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancer Publishers, Roy"/&gt;{{rp|210}}

==History==

On 12 November 2007, representatives of the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (Roscosmos) and ISRO signed an agreement for the two agencies to work together on the Chandrayaan-2 project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nerve.in/news:25350099047 |title=India, Russia to expand n-cooperation, defer Kudankulam deal |work=Nerve |first=Manish |last=Chand |date=12 November 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113024836/http://www.nerve.in/news%3A25350099047 |archivedate=13 January 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISRO would have the prime responsibility for the orbiter and rover, while Roscosmos was to provide the lander.

The [[Government of India|Indian government]] approved the mission in a meeting of the [[Union Council of Ministers|Union Cabinet]], held on 18 September 2008 and chaired by [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]].&lt;ref name="Hindu3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article1341321.ece |title=Cabinet clears Chandrayaan-2 |work=The Hindu |first=P. |last=Sunderarajan |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design of the spacecraft was completed in August 2009, with scientists of both countries conducting a joint review.&lt;ref name="design_complete_1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.domain-b.com/aero/space/spacemissions/20090817_chandrayaan-2_design.html |title=ISRO completes Chandrayaan-2 design |website=Domain-b.com |date=17 August 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="design_complete_2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sputniknews.com/world/20090817/155832962.html |title=India and Russia complete design of new lunar probe |work=Sputnik News |agency=RIA Novosti |date=17 August 2009 |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission's lander is called ''Vikram'', named after [[Vikram Sarabhai]] (1919-1971) who is widely regarded as the father of the Indian space programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chandrayaan-2-lander-to-be-named-vikram-after-sarabhai/articleshow/65375102.cms |title=Chandrayaan-2 Lander to be named ‘Vikram’ after Sarabhai |work=The Times of India |agency=Times News Network |first=Chethan |last=Kumar |date=12 August 2018 |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Vikram'' lander will detach from the orbiter and descend to a lunar orbit of {{convert|30|x|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} using its {{convert|800|N|abbr=on}} liquid main engines. It will then perform a comprehensive check of all its on-board systems before attempting to land on the lunar surface. Unlike Chandrayaan-1's [[Moon Impact Probe]], the ''Vikram'' lander will make a [[Soft landing (rocketry)|soft landing]], deploy the rover, and perform some scientific activities for approximately 15 days. The approximate combined mass of the lander and rover is {{convert|1471|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ndtv20180829"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idos20180828"/&gt; The preliminary configuration study of the lander was completed in 2013 by the Space Applications Centre (SAC) in Ahmedabad.&lt;ref name="postponed"/&gt;

The lander's propulsion system consists of eight {{convert|50|N|abbr=on|}} thrusters for [[attitude control]] and five {{convert|800|N|abbr=on}} liquid main engines derived from ISRO's {{convert|440|N|abbr=on|}} [[Liquid apogee engine|Liquid Apogee Motor]].&lt;ref name="timesin20180812" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299457197_Development_of_a_Proportional_Flow_Control_Valve_for_the_800N_Engine_Test |title=Development of a Proportional Flow Control Valve for the 800N Engine Test |conference=9th National Symposium and Exhibition on Aerospace and Related Mechanisms.

The additional engine is expected to mitigate upward draft of [[Lunar soil|lunar dust]] during the soft landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.frontline.in/science-and-technology/article24801393.ece |title=ISRO developing vehicle to launch small satellites |work=Frontline |access-date=29 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some associated technologies include a high resolution camera, navigation camera, hazard avoidance camera, an 800&amp;nbsp;N throttleable liquid main engine and attitude thrusters, altimeter, velocity meter, accelerometer, and the software needed to run these components.&lt;ref name="duration" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AR2015" /&gt; The lander's main engine has successfully undergone a high altitude test for a duration of 513 seconds, and closed loop verification tests of the sensors, actuators and software were completed in 2016.&lt;ref name="AR2016" /&gt; Engineering models of the lander began undergoing ground and aerial tests in late October 2016, in [[Challakere]] in the [[Chitradurga]] district of [[Karnataka]].

===Rover===
[[File:Chandrayaan 2 Rover.jpg|thumb|Artist impression of the rover]]
The rover's mass will be about {{convert|27|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and will operate on solar power.&lt;ref name="ndtv20180829"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idos20180828"/&gt; The rover will move on 6 wheels on the lunar surface, perform on-site chemical analysis and send the data to the orbiter above, which will relay it to the Earth station.&lt;ref name=payload/&gt;&lt;ref name="Economic"/&gt;

The initial plan was for the rover to be designed in Russia and fabricated in India. However, after Russia proved unable to contribute to the mission,&lt;ref name="postponed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="delay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ndtv20120909"/&gt; ISRO decided on designing and fabricating the rover itself. [[IIT Kanpur]] is developing three subsystems to provide mobility:
#Stereoscopic camera-based 3D vision using two NAVCAMs in front of rover will provide the ground team controlling the rovers a 3D view of the surrounding terrain and help in path planning by generating a [[digital elevation model]] of the terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acadpubl.eu/jsi/2018-118-16-17/articles/16/69.pdf|title=Realization of Space Grade Miniature Digital Camera for Lunar Navigation|last=Laha|first=Jayant|last2=Dinesh|first2=B|date=30 December 2017|website=|publisher=International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926220226/https://acadpubl.eu/jsi/2018-118-16-17/articles/16/69.pdf|archive-date=26 September 2018|dead-url=|access-date=9 November 2018|last3=Selvaraj|first3=P|last4=Krishnamoorthy|first4=Subhalakshmi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Kinematic traction control - will enable the rover to negotiate the rough lunar terrain using independent steering provided on four of its wheels.
#Control and motor dynamics -  The rover will have six wheels, each driven by an independent electric motor. Four of the wheels will also be capable of independent steering. A total of 10 electric motors will be used for traction and steering.

'''''Deadwood''''' is an American [[western (genre)|Western]] television series created, produced, and largely written by [[David Milch]],&lt;ref name="milchny"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/02/14/050214fa_fact_singer#editorsnote |title=The Misfit |last=Singer |first=Mark |date=February 14, 2005 |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aired on the [[premium television|premium]] [[cable television|cable network]] [[HBO]] from March 21, 2004, to August 27, 2006, spanning [[List of Deadwood episodes|36 episodes and three seasons]]. The series, set in the 1870s in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], before and after the area's annexation by the [[Dakota Territory]], charts Deadwood's growth from camp to town, incorporating themes including the formation of communities. The show features a large [[ensemble cast]], and many historical figures appear as characters, such as [[Seth Bullock]], [[George Crook]], [[Wyatt Earp]], [[E. B. Farnum]], [[George Hearst]], [[Wild Bill Hickok]], [[Calamity Jane]], [[Jack McCall]], [[Sol Star]], [[Al Swearengen]], and [[Charlie Utter]]. The plot lines involving these characters include historical truths as well as substantial fictional elements. Milch used actual diaries and newspapers from 1870s Deadwood residents as reference points for characters, events, and the look and feel of the show. Some of the characters are fully fictional, although they may have been based on actual persons.

''Deadwood'' received wide critical acclaim, particularly for Milch's writing and [[Ian McShane]]'s co-lead performance, and is now regarded as one of the greatest TV dramas of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/100-greatest-tv-shows-of-all-time-w439520/deadwood-w439616 |title=100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time: 'Deadwood' |last=Sheffield |first=Rob |publisher=''Rolling Stone'' |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{bullet}}{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-tv-shows-ever/ |title=The 50 best TV shows ever |work=Empire |date=August 15, 2016 |accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{bullet}}{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/14/deadwood-is-the-best-drama-hbo-has-ever-made-it-must-be-revived |title=Deadwood is the best drama HBO has ever made – it must be revived |work=The Guardian |first=Pete |last=Cashmore |date=August 14, 2015 |accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{bullet}}{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2009/12/29/10-best-tv-shows-of-the-decade/slide/deadwood/ |title=Top 10 TV Shows of the 2000s |work=Time |first=James |last=Poniewozik |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{bullet}}{{cite web |url=https://theringer.com/deadwood-hbo-tv-the-book-dadb4007790e#.gwhddag6k |title=Why ‘Deadwood’ Is a Top-10 TV Show of All Time |work=The Ringer |author1=Sepinwall, Alan |author2=Seitz, Matt Zoller |date=August 31, 2016 |accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won eight [[Emmy Awards]] (in 28 nominations) and one [[Golden Globe]]. ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it #8 on their 2013 list of 60 shows that were "Cancelled Too Soon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Roush, Matt |date=June 3, 2013 |title=Cancelled Too Soon |work=[[TV Guide]] |pages=20 and 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was produced by Red Board Productions and Roscoe Productions in association with HBO and [[Paramount Television|Paramount Network Television]].

There were initial plans to conclude the series with two TV films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2007/04/deadwoods_retur.html |title='Deadwood's return 'most likely' delayed until 2008 |work=Chicago Tribune |first=Maureen |last=Ryan |date=April 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but those plans never came to fruition.

==Production==
The first book that the show's creator, David Milch, purchased as research for the series was ''Deadwood: The Golden Years'' by [[Watson Parker]], a [[historian]] who specialized in the history of the Black Hills.&lt;ref name=rcj&gt;{{cite news |first=Lynn |last=Taylor Rick |title='Dean' of Black Hills history dies |url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/communities/lead-deadwood/a5c433a5-3dc1-58c7-af57-e63d5b4dddea.html |work=[[Rapid City Journal]] |date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milch and his colleagues later bought many of Parker's books and papers as references for ''Deadwood''.&lt;ref name=rcj/&gt;

==Themes==
Milch has pointed out repeatedly in interviews that the intent of the show was to study the way that civilization comes together from chaos by organizing itself around symbols (in ''Deadwood'' the main symbol is gold). Initially, he intended to study this within Roman civilization (the central symbol was to be the religious cross), but HBO's ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' series was already in development and Milch was asked by the network if he could stage the story in another place.&lt;ref name="esquire"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sancton |first=Julian |date=January 14, 2011 |url=http://www.esquire.com/the-side/qa/david-milch-luck-interview-011411 |title=David Milch Does Not Believe in Genres |work=Esquire |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the series touches on a variety of issues including race, prostitution, misogyny, violence, politics, and immigration, most of the major story lines are grounded in this issue of bringing order from chaos.

{{:List of Deadwood episodes}}

===Season 1 (2004)===
[[File:DeadwoodSeason1 DVDcover.jpg|thumb|upright|''Deadwood'' Season 1 DVD]]
The first season takes place in 1876, six months after the founding of the camp, soon after [[Custer's Last Stand]]. Seth Bullock leaves his job as a marshal in Montana to establish a hardware business in the [[gold-mining]] camp of Deadwood, along with his friend and business partner, Sol Star. Wild Bill Hickok, the infamous [[gunslinger]] of the west, is on a separate journey to Deadwood, accompanied by Charlie Utter and Calamity Jane. Al Swearengen is the owner of The Gem, a local saloon and brothel. Other notable residents include Dr. Amos Cochran; A. W. Merrick, owner and editor of the local newspaper "The Pioneer"; and E. B. Farnum, proprietor of The Grand Central Hotel. 

Bullock encounters a man of an unknown name, who claims that Indians had killed an immigrant family along the road, and he and Hickok along with others ride out to investigate. Swearengen at his saloon offers bounties for Indian scalps, in apparent revenge for the murders, and discounts on booze and women. Bullock and Hickok investigate and find the wagon turned over and all but one of the immigrant family killed. Before sunrise they confront the unknown man and point to holes in his story, saying the raid appeared to be a setup by whites. When he draws his weapon both men draw in defense, and Hickok's bullet kills him. Swearengen wakes to hear of these new events as told by E.B. Farnum, and is particularly unhappy hearing that one of the immigrant party survived, suspecting that his road agents may have been responsible for the raid.

Brom Garret, a wealthy businessman from New York City, lives at The Grand Central Hotel with his wife, Alma, who nurses a secret [[laudanum]] habit. Aware that Garret is interested in prospecting, Swearengen and Farnum deceive him into purchasing a [[gold placer claim|gold claim]] in a [[confidence game]].  Newly arrived Cy Tolliver and his entourage purchase an abandoned hotel across from The Gem and begin renovations, then open the Bella Union Saloon, a luxurious gambling house and brothel. Brom Garret soon learns that his gold claim is worthless and demands Swearengen reimburse his money. Swearengen orders Dan Dority to kill Garret and "make it look like an accident." Dority throws Garret off a cliff, only to discover that the claim is actually a rich one after all. Newly widowed Alma Garret asks Wild Bill Hickok for guidance regarding the gold claim and Swearengen's renewed interest. Hickok asks Bullock to advise Garret; Bullock agrees. Bullock suggests that Garret hire Whitney Ellsworth, a trustworthy and experienced prospector. Alma Garret takes [[child custody|custody]] of young Sofia Metz, whose family was murdered on the way back to Minnesota.

During a poker game, Wild Bill Hickok is murdered by Jack McCall in Tom Nuttall's #10 Saloon. When McCall is put on trial, Swearengen leans on the acting magistrate, suggesting that McCall must be acquitted to avoid scrutiny from Washington, D.C. The judge cuts the trial short and the jury acquits McCall, who leaves town immediately after the verdict. Bullock pursues McCall, determined to bring him to justice. Bullock and Charlie Utter later find McCall hiding at a boarding house and take him to [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]] for trial.

[[Smallpox]] spreads in Deadwood, creating an urgent need for vaccines. The afflicted are segregated from the main camp in plague tents. Calamity Jane aids Doctor Cochran in caring for the sick.

The senior members of the community form a [[Local government|municipal government]] to prepare for future [[annexation]], as well as to bribe the territorial legislature, thereby ensuring the security of existing titles, claims and properties. Swearengen bribes local magistrate Clagett to quash a murder warrant.

Alma's father Otis Russell arrives with plans to secure Alma's new-found wealth in order to pay off his endless debts and fulfill his own greed. The U.S. army arrives in Deadwood and a parade is organized. Bullock confronts a self-confident Otis Russell in The Bella Union. When Russell threatens the safety of his own daughter should Bullock stand in the way of his acquiring the gold claim, Seth unceremoniously beats him and orders Russell to leave the camp.

The increasingly addled Reverend Smith, dying from an apparent [[brain tumor]], is smothered to death by Al Swearengen in a mercy killing. Tolliver attempts to bribe [[George Crook|General Crook]] to leave a [[garrison]] in Deadwood but is indignantly refused. When Magistrate Clagett attempts to extort Swearengen further over the murder warrant, Swearengen responds by enlisting Clagett's "toll collector," Silas Adams, to murder Clagett. Silas performs the deed and allies himself with Swearengen, becoming his agent. As Sheriff Con Stapleton has been compromised by Cy Tolliver, Bullock volunteers to become the new sheriff as the cavalry rides out of town.

===Season 2 (2005)===
[[File:Deadwood Season2.jpg|thumb|upright|''Deadwood'' Season 2 DVD cover]]
Season two begins in 1877, seven months after the events of season 1, and the camp has become somewhat more orderly and civilized.

When Swearengen publicly disparages Bullock's abilities as sheriff, intimating that Bullock's focus is not on his job due to his affair with Alma Garret, Bullock removes his gun and badge and Swearengen and Bullock fight, accidentally falling over the Gem balcony. Al is about to slit Bullock's throat in the muddy street, but stops after looking up to see Bullock's wife [[Characters of Deadwood#Martha Bullock|Martha]] and her son William arriving in camp. Bullock tells Alma they must either leave camp or stop seeing one another. Garret agrees that it is better to end the relationship and remain in town.  Calamity Jane resurfaces and manages to support Bullock and Utter in persuading Swearengen to return Bullock's gun and badge. A truce is made. Garret discovers she is pregnant by Bullock and confides in Trixie, who persuades Ellsworth to make a marriage proposal to Garret and influences Garret to accept the proposal in order to save her the humiliation of unwed motherhood.

Swearengen collapses in his office with the door locked. His concerned associates assume that he wants to be left alone, but as the day passes their alarm grows and they finally break into the office. Dr. Cochran diagnoses Al with [[kidney stone]]s and performs a draining procedure. Swearengen eventually passes the stones, but has a small stroke in the process.

Joanie Stubbs opens her own brothel, The Chez Amis, with her newly arrived partner Maddie. Francis Wolcott, a geologist working for George Hearst, arrives in Deadwood and soon makes his presence felt at the Chez Amis. Wolcott has paid for transportation of most of the prostitutes, in order to cater to his selective tastes. Cy Tolliver learns of Wolcott's sexual proclivities and baits him, resulting in Wolcott murdering Carrie and Doris, two of Joanie Stubb's prostitutes. When Maddie attempts to extort money from Wolcott, he kills her too. Cy Tolliver has the bodies removed and pardons Wolcott.  Joanie sends the remaining girls away so that they will be safe from Wolcott. Joanie confides in Charlie Utter regarding the murders, extracting a promise that he never repeat the information.

Alma fires Miss Isringhausen, Sophia's tutor.  Isringhausen turns to Silas Adams under the pretext of fear for her life at the hands of the Widow Garret, and they embark upon a relationship. Isringhausen convinces Adams to allow her to meet with Swearengen. At the meeting, she admits to being an agent of the [[Pinkertons]] under the employ of Brom Garret's family, who instructed Isringhausen to frame Alma for soliciting Swearengen to murder her husband. Swearengen agrees to play along, but later reveals to Garret that he intends to blackmail Isringhausen due to his hatred for the Pinkerton agency.

Samuel Fields, "The Nigger General", returns to camp. He tries to enlist Hostetler in his schemes. Bullock is forced to rescue him from an angry [[Crowd|mob]] headed by Steve, a virulently racist drunk. Later, Hostetler catches a drunken Steve in the [[livery]] stable masturbating on Bullock's horse in revenge. Fields and Hostetler manage to coerce Steve into signing a written confession of [[bestiality]]. The admission will be publicized should Steve make any trouble for either of the livery workers in the future.

Hugo Jarry, a Yankton [[commissioner]], tries to persuade Swearengen and Tolliver that Deadwood should become part of Dakota territory rather than Montana. He ends up siding with Swearengen.

Alma Garret enlists the help of Sol Star to establish a bank in the camp.

Wolcott's agent Lee burns the bodies of captive Chinese prostitutes who have died from malnourishment while under his control. Mr. Wu is enraged and requests Swearengen's help to stop Lee. Because Lee is employed by Wolcott, who is in turn employed by George Hearst, Swearengen refuses any help until after negotiations over the town's future have been resolved. Mr. Wu escapes Swearengen's house arrest at The Gem, but Johnny Burns stops him from exacting his revenge on Lee or being killed himself.

William Bullock is trampled by a horse that escapes during a failed [[gelding]] and dies several hours after. His funeral is attended by many of Deadwood's citizens and the service is conducted by former [[card sharp]] Andy Cramed, who has returned to Deadwood an [[Ordination|ordained]] [[Minister of religion|minister]].

George Hearst arrives in Deadwood and when he learns of the murders committed by Wolcott, confronts and fires him. Hearst purchases the Grand Central hotel from E. B. Farnum. The shamed Wolcott hangs himself. Tolliver claims to be in possession of a letter of confession in which Wolcott states that Hearst was aware of his murderous ways, yet continued his employment. Tolliver blackmails Hearst for 5% of every Gold Claim he has acquired in Deadwood.

Al Swearengen negotiates with George Hearst on behalf of Mr. Wu, and they agree that Wu can regain his status if his people prove to be better workers than those of the "San Francisco cocksucker" Lee. Mr. Wu and Swearengen's henchmen  plan vengeance in Deadwood's [[Chinatown]]. The operation is successful and Wu slits the throat of his rival.

Alma Garret and Ellsworth marry at a ceremony conducted by Andy Cramed at the Grand Central hotel. After much dealing and double-dealing on the part of Swearengen and Silas Adams, the official papers confirming Deadwood's annexation into Yankton territory are signed by Bullock and Swearengen with Hugo Jarry present. Andy Cramed stabs Tolliver outside the Bella Union.

===Season 3 (2006)===
[[File:Deadwood Season3.jpg|thumb|upright|''Deadwood'' Season 3 DVD cover]]
Season three begins six weeks after the events of season 2, government and law, as well as the interests of powerful commercial entities, begin to enter the town as Deadwood prepares itself for entry into [[Dakota Territory]].

Hearst has several of his own [[Cornish people|Cornish]] miners murdered when they attempt to unionize. Elections are announced: Star and Farnum run for Mayor, while Bullock and barman Harry Manning compete for Sheriff. Angered that Hearst had someone killed in the Gem, Al cancels the election debates in an attempt to reassert his position in the camp. To teach Al a lesson and force him to help Hearst buy Alma's claim, Hearst has his lead [[henchman]] Captain Turner restrain Al, then chops off one of his fingers.

Over Ellsworth's strong objections, Alma meets with Hearst to discuss buying her claim. Hearst becomes furious when she offers him a merely non-controlling interest and behaves menacingly towards Alma, but then allows her to leave without following through on his implied threat of rape.

Tolliver slowly recovers after being stabbed and gets back on his feet. Hearst knows Cy is lying about having a letter from Wolcott but decides to employ Cy to help deal with the members of the camp. Traveling actor Jack Langrishe arrives in Deadwood with his theatre troupe.  He is an old friend of Swearengen's and eventually buys the former Chez Amis from Joannie Stubbs on condition that he build a new school house for the camp's children. Alma undergoes a [[Dilation and curettage|D &amp; C]] by Doc Cochran when her pregnancy threatens her health.

Hostetler and Samuel "The Nigger General" Fields return to the camp to find that Steve has taken over the livery. Bullock mediates between them, eventually getting Hostetler to agree to sell the Livery to Steve. Steve's ranting, racial slurs and impugning of Hostetler's honor finally drive the latter over the edge and he shoots himself.

Another miner is killed. Already angry from the Hostetler/Steve ordeal, Bullock arrests Hearst, drags him by the ear through the public thoroughfare and puts him in jail overnight.

Alma is once again using dope. Leon confesses to Cy that he is Alma's supplier. Cy relays this news to Hearst but Hearst is still angry from his encounter with Bullock and believes that if Tolliver had told him this useful news beforehand he might not have provoked the sheriff.  A furious Tolliver tells Leon to do nothing, but Leon, afraid of being implicated in Alma's murder, has already cut her off.  Suspecting that Alma's return to drugs is due to her unhappiness at being married to a man she doesn't love, Ellsworth moves out of their house. They later agree to separate and Alma is able to stop taking the laudanum.

Hearst brings a large force of Pinkertons to the camp and encourages them to stir up trouble. Swearengen holds a meeting to decide what to do about Hearst. The town leaders are unable to decide on any direct action, other than to publish a letter from Bullock to the wife of one of the murdered miners that subtly highlights Hearst's callousness. Hearst has Merrick beaten for publishing it.

Alma is shot at in the street. Swearengen takes her into the Gem and orders Dan to kidnap and restrain Ellsworth. Al guesses, correctly, that Hearst ordered the shooting, in an attempt to provoke then kill Ellsworth when he comes to Alma's aid. Hearst sends his second, the same man that beat Merrick and possibly also shot at Alma, to negotiate with Swearengen; Al kills him after extracting information. The town unites to protect Alma as she returns to work at the bank. Hearst has Ellsworth assassinated in his tent at Alma's mine.  Trixie shoots Hearst in revenge for Ellsworth's death but fails to kill him. Fearing for her and Sofia's lives and unwilling to make the camp responsible for her protection, Alma sells her claim to Hearst to avoid further bloodshed.

Bullock receives discouraging news about the county election returns in his race for sheriff against Harry Manning, all the while knowing Hearst may have manipulated the results using Federal soldiers brought in to vote for his handpicked candidate elsewhere in the county.

Hearst demands that the whore who shot him be executed.  Swearengen and Wu gather a militia in case a war breaks out. Al murders the prostitute Jen, despite Johnny's objections, in the hope of passing her corpse off as Trixie and placating Hearst. The ruse works and Hearst leaves Deadwood, giving over control of "all his other-than-mining interests" to Tolliver. Tolliver points a gun at Hearst from his balcony and wants to shoot him but instead watches as Bullock sees a smirking Hearst out of the camp.  Enraged that Hearst is cutting him off, Tolliver takes his frustrations out on Leon by stabbing him in the femoral artery.  Johnny and Al speak briefly of Jen's death, before Al returns to scrubbing her bloodstain.

==Use of profanity==
From its debut, ''Deadwood'' drew attention for its extensive profanity. It is a deliberate [[anachronism]] on the part of the creator with a twofold intent. Milch explained in several interviews that the characters were originally intended to use period slang and swear words. Such words, however, were based heavily on the time's deep religious roots and tended to be more blasphemous than scatological. Instead of being shockingly crude (in keeping with the tone of a frontier mining camp), the results sounded comical. As [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] put it "… if you put words like 'goldarn' into the mouths of the characters on ''Deadwood'', they'd all wind up sounding like [[Yosemite Sam]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/deadwood.html |title=Obscenity Rap |first=Geoffrey |last=Nunberg |accessdate=May 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, it was decided that the show would use current profanity in order for the words to have the same impact on modern audiences as the blasphemous ones did back in the 1870s. In early episodes, the character of Mr. Wu excessively uses "cocksucker," his favorite derogatory term for those whom he dislikes. Wu is also fond of the Cantonese derogatory term "[[gweilo]]" which he applies to the camp's white males.

The other intent in regard to the frequency of the swearing was to signal to the audience the lawlessness of the camp in much the same way that the original inhabitants used it to show that they were living outside the bounds of "civil society."

The issue of the authenticity of ''Deadwood'''s dialogue has even been alluded to in the show itself. Early in the second season, E.B. Farnum has fleeced Mr. Wolcott of $9,900, and Farnum tries to console the geologist:

{{quote|EB: Some ancient Italian maxim fits our situation, whose particulars escape me.

''Deadwood'' received almost universal praise from critics over the course of its three-year run. On [[Metacritic]], the first season had an 80 out of 100 score sampled from 26 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name=MetacriticS1/&gt; The second and third season had near universal acclaim,&lt;ref name=MetacriticS2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MetacriticS3/&gt; with only one mixed review of the third season coming from ''[[Newsday]]'''s Verne Gay. The praise generally centered on the strength of the writing and Milch's unique style of dialogue. ''[[Time Out New York]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnston]] listed ''Deadwood'' in his top ten TV shows for both 2005 and 2006, commenting: "If history is written by the victors, ''Deadwood'' is all about giving the losers their due. In the first season, magnificent bastard Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) came off as a villain; this year, his inevitably doomed campaign to save the lawless town from annexation by the United States and exploitation by robber barons served as a brilliant allegory for the evolution of American capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/the-best-and-worst-in-tv-2005 |title=The best and worst in TV 2005 |work=Time Out New York |first=Andrew |last=Johnston |date=December 29, 2005 |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength and depth of the casting was cited repeatedly by critics and further substantiated by numerous nominations for best casting in a dramatic series. In an interview in 2012 with ''[[Adweek]]'', film critic [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] said that he considers ''Deadwood'' to be "the greatest TV show ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTxxW7EaQ8k |title=Six Questions: Matt Zoller Seitz |time=0:36 |publisher=YouTube |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
On May 13, 2006, HBO confirmed it had opted not to pick up the options of the actors, which were set to expire on June 11, 2006. This meant that a fourth season with the current cast as it stood was unlikely, though HBO had stressed that the show was not cancelled and talks regarding its future were continuing. The chances of the show returning with its current lineup of cast and crew were limited.

==Film continuation==
{{main|Deadwood (2019 film)}}
On June 5, 2006, HBO and creator David Milch agreed to make two two-hour television films in place of a fourth season, after Milch declined a short-order of six episodes. This was because in the show's original format, each season portrayed two weeks in the life of Deadwood, with each episode representing one day. The final two-hour format would release these time restraints and allow for a broader narrative to finish off the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/06/07/showbuzz/index.html#2 |title='Deadwood' to return |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=May 5, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113170049/http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/06/07/showbuzz/index.html |archivedate=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on January 13, 2007, Milch stated that he still intended to finish the two films, if possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/zap-davidmilchdeadwoodmovies,0,440663.story |title=Milch: 'Deadwood' Movies Still Alive |publisher=Zap2it |first=Rick |last=Porter |date=January 13, 2007 |accessdate=May 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110200310/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/zap-davidmilchdeadwoodmovies%2C0%2C440663.story |archivedate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12, 2007, HBO executives admitted that producing the telefilms would be difficult and put the chances of their ever being made at "50–50."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/deadwood-are-the-two-wrap-up-movies-dead/ |title=Deadwood: Are the Two Wrap-up Movies Dead? |publisher=TV Series Finale |date=July 13, 2007 |accessdate=May 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Ian McShane]] claimed in an interview on October 1, 2007, that the show's sets were due to be dismantled and that the movies would not be made;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.moviefone.ca/2007/09/30/exclusive-ian-mcshane-tells-cinematical-hbo-has-scrapped-those/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Ian McShane Tells Cinematical HBO Has Scrapped Those 'Deadwood' Movies |publisher=Moviefone |first=Ryan |last=Stewart |date=September 30, 2007 |accessdate=May 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he was referring to the show-related set pieces, i.e., front added to the buildings, props, etc., the set as itself, "[[Movie ranch#Monogram Ranch – Melody Ranch|Melody Ranch]]", being unchanged at least as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melodyranchstudio.com/thetown.html |title=The Town |publisher=Melody Ranch Motion Picture Studio |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors [[Jim Beaver]] and [[W.

I still nourish the hope that we're going to get to do a little more work in that area."&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt; In a March 21, 2012, interview, Milch was asked if the movies would ever be produced and replied, "No, I don’t think so. We got really close about a year ago. Never say never, but it doesn’t look that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matt Zoller |last=Seitz |title=The Vulture Transcript: Michael Mann and David Milch Open Up About the Cancellation of Luck |date=March 21, 2012 |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/03/michael-mann-david-milch-interview-luck-horses-cancellation.html |work=Vulture |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2015, it was reported that talks between HBO and Milch had resumed regarding a ''Deadwood'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |title=''Deadwood'' Wrap-Up Movie: It's Finally (Maybe) Happening |url=http://tvline.com/2015/08/12/deadwood-movie-hbo-reunion-revival/ |publisher=TVLine |date=August 12, 2015 |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/hbo-confirms-early-talks-of-deadwood-movie-1201569178/ |title=HBO Confirms Early Talks of ‘Deadwood’ Movie |work=Variety |first=Stuart |last=Oldham |date=August 12, 2015 |accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, HBO gave Milch the [[green-light]] to write a script for the film.&lt;ref name="movie"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |title=''Deadwood'' Reunion Movie 'Is Going to Happen,' Promises HBO President |url=http://tvline.com/2016/01/07/deadwood-movie-reunion-hbo-premiere-date/ |publisher=TVLine |date=January 7, 2016 |accessdate=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 2016, Casey Bloys, HBO's new head of programming, stated that Milch was writing the script for a ''Deadwood'' movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/deadwood-movie-update/ |title=‘Deadwood’ Movie Currently Being Written, Says HBO |publisher=Collider |date=August 1, 2016 |first=Chris |last=Cabin |accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 2017, McShane announced that Milch submitted a script for a two-hour ''Deadwood'' movie to HBO, saying "[A] two-hour movie script has been delivered to HBO. If they don't deliver [a finished product], blame them." McShane said that he hoped to discuss the film with Milch further, and said of the original cast returning that "we'd all love to do it ... It would be nice to see all of the old gang again."&lt;ref name="DeadwoodMovieApr2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2017/04/18/deadwood-revival-movie-hbo-ian-mcshane-returns/ |title=Deadwood Revival Script 'Has Been Delivered to HBO,' Says Ian McShane |publisher=TVLine |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |date=April 18, 2017 |accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, 2017, [[TVLine]] reported that the ''Deadwood'' movie is set to begin production in fall 2018, although HBO had not officially green-lit the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2017/11/12/deadwood-2018-revival-reunion-movie-ian-mcshane/ |title=HBO's Deadwood Revival Movie Eyes Fall 2018 Production Start |publisher=TVLine |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |date=November 12, 2017 |accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2018, [[Robin Weigert]] in an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that a ''Deadwood'' film would likely be filmed in the fall of 2018. "It’s safe enough to say [the film] is happening this fall," she said. "There’s a set being built and tax incentives to get it done. A lot of [actors] have signed on. There’s a 90% chance it’ll finally happen." Five days later on July 25, HBO confirmed that a ''Deadwood'' movie had been greenlit and that [[Dan Minahan]], who directed four episodes in the series' original run, would direct the film, with production set to begin in October 2018.&lt;ref name="MovieGreenlit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/07/deadwood-movie-hbo/ |title=Deadwood movie officially a go at HBO |publisher=Consequence of Sound |date=July 25, 2018 |first=Alex |last=Young |accessdate=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research requested by the producers, the film is likely to be set in 1889, approximately 10 years after the end of season 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhpioneer.com/local_news/hbo-orders-up-a-big-dose-of-deadwood/article_bc472846-966c-11e8-bc05-2f48a65b2431.html |title=HBO orders up a big dose of 'Deadwood' |publisher=Black Hills Pioneer |date=August 2, 2018 |first=Jaci |last=Pearson |accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, 2018, W. Earl Brown gave his thoughts on the final draft of the script saying, "in the course of those two hours, my emotions ricocheted in every fucking direction: exhilaration to melancholy; hoots of joy to screams of despair. The Maestro has topped himself. The structure is essentially the same as the first version I read a year and a half ago, but the complexities of the relationships, the emotional peaks and depths, are all sharpened to a razor fine edge. It’s gut wrenching." Brown also confirmed that everyone in the main cast would be returning; however, the characters played by [[Powers Boothe]] and [[Ralph Richeson]], who have since died, would not be recast. "Everyone from the main cast who still draws air, with the exception of Silas Adams [Titus Welliver]" would return, Brown said. Production on the film was set to begin on October 5, 2018, according to Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uproxx.com/movies/deadwood-movie-time-jump-recast-roles/ |title=The ‘Deadwood’ Movie Will Feature A Significant Time Jump While Not Recasting Any Roles |publisher=Uproxx |date=August 22, 2018 |first=Andrew |last=Husband |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is planned for a spring 2019 premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/deadwood-movie-hbo-1202883965/ |title=‘Deadwood’ Movie Gets Greenlight at HBO |work=Variety |date=July 25, 2018 |first=Joe |last=Otterson |accessdate=September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 5, 2018, HBO announced that the film had begun production, confirming the returns of several cast members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://medium.com/hbo-cinemax-pr/hbo-films-deadwood-movie-begins-production-33bd8d55d06e |title=HBO FILMS’ “DEADWOOD” MOVIE BEGINS PRODUCTION |date=November 5, 2018 |website=HBO &amp; Cinemax PR |access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/deadwood-movie-starts-filming-majority-cast-returning-1158128 |title='Deadwood' Movie Starts Filming with Majority of Cast Returning |last=Porter |first=Rick |date=November 5, 2018 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home video releases==
All three seasons are available on DVD and Blu-ray. HBO was responsible for the North American releases, while [[Paramount Home Entertainment]] handled international distribution—the latter being a byproduct of [[CBS Studios International]] (the successor-in-interest to the [[Paramount Television|television unit]] of [[Paramount Pictures]]) handling worldwide TV distribution for the series (as Paramount Television co-produced the series with HBO). ''Deadwood: The Complete Series'' was released on December 9, 2008. This DVD set includes a special bonus disc with new features, most prominently a focus on what would have occurred in the fourth season. The Blu-ray contains the same extras as found on the DVD set.

The '''Decision Sciences Institute''' ('''DSI''') is a [[professional association]] of university professors, graduate students, and practitioners whose interest lies in the application of [[quantitative research]] and [[qualitative research]] to the decision problems of individuals, organizations, and society. Many of the members of this [[academic organization]] are faculty members in [[business schools]]. 

Members of the Institute share their research findings at DSI's Annual Meeting (DSI's main [[academic conference]]), international DSI meetings, or regional conferences. The Decision Sciences Institute also publishes two journals and hosts annual award competitions for contributions to innovation education, the best case study, and best doctoral dissertation. In addition, the Institute offers job placement services, doctoral student and new faculty consortia, and a variety of professional development activities.

==Journals==

The Decision Sciences Institute publishes two academic journals, ''[[Decision Sciences (journal)]]'' and ''[[Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education]]''. Both journals are printed and distributed by [[Wiley-Blackwell]] and have subscriptions totaling over 5,000. In addition, the publication ''Decision Line'', includes a wide range of practical and educational feature columns (international studies, ecommerce, academic research, production/operations management issues, information technology, doctoral studies, and classroom instruction), as well as news items that inform the membership of past, present, and future events.

==Regions==
There are currently eight (8) regions. There are five regions in the United States and three (4) outside the U.S. (Europe, Mexico, Asia-Pacific, and the Indian subcontinent). The regions operate independently within the Institute. Each region elects its own officers and one representative who serves on the Institute’s Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="decisionsciences1"&gt;[http://www.decisionsciences.org/regions/default.asp Decision Sciences Institute]. Decisionsciences.org. Retrieved on October 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
DSI's home office is located in Atlanta, Georgia, where it receives support from the [[J. Mack Robinson College of Business]] at [[Georgia State University]]. Dennis E. Grawoig founded the organization in 1968 and served as its first president for two years and as its executive director until 1986. The Executive Director of the Institute from 1986 until her untimely death on June 3, 2013 was Carol J. Latta.

As of April 19, 2014 DSI, was moved from the GSU campus to the [[University of Houston]].

== History ==
In November 1968, a small group of faculty members met in Atlanta, Georgia to propose an academic society that would encourage interdisciplinary (now cross-disciplinary) participation in the new field of decision sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Gass, Saul I &amp; Assad, Arjang A. (2005). ''An Annotated Timeline of Operations Research: An Informal History,'' New York, NY: Kluwer Academic Publishers, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first annual meeting of the American Institute for Decision Sciences (AIDS) was held in New Orleans in 1969. About 100 charter members were in attendance. 

The Institute's first journal, ''Decision Sciences'', was first published in 1970. In 2003, DSI began publishing a second journal, the ''Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education (DSJIE)''. DSJIE publishes research on teaching and learning issues.

In 1986, the name of the organization was changed to the Decision Sciences Institute "once the name AIDS became linked in the public's mind with a newly emerging disease."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Vázsonyi|Vazsonyi, Andrew]] (2002). ''Which Door has the Cadillac: Adventures of a Real-Life Mathematician,'' Lincoln, NE: iUniverse, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1986, Carol Latta has served as the Institute's Executive Director. She was made a Fellow of DSI in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;''Robinson in Review,'' Vol. 5, No. 1, (2004) p. 6 and p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  

DSI is one of a handful of organizations that address solving real-world business problems. One way in which DSI distinguishes itself from similar organizations is in addressing educational issues including curriculum, pedagogy, and careers.&lt;ref&gt;Vazsonyi (2002), pp. 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Attendance at the Annual Meetings is now in the range of 1300 to 1400 attendees. The Institute is an independent non-profit educational organization.

In order to further research in the decision sciences, the membership of the Decision Sciences Institute has been asked to participate in studies and surveys&lt;ref&gt;Barman, S., Tersine, R., &amp; Buckley, M. (1991). "An Empirical Assessment of the Perceived Relevance and Quality of POM-Related Journals by Academicians". ''Journal of Operations Management'', 10(2), 194–212.&lt;/ref&gt; and the research papers published in DSI conference proceedings have been studied.&lt;ref&gt;Amoaki-Gyampah, K., &amp; Meredith, J. (1989). "The Operations Management Research Agenda: An Update". ''Journal of Operations Management'', 8(3), 250–262.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In March 2008, the Decision Sciences Institute Wikipedia entry was developed.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, K. (2008). "Wikipedia and DSI: Building a Decision Sciences Institute Knowledgebase". ''Decision Line'', 39(3),15–17.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The honor of [http://www.decisionsciences.org/people/fellow.asp Fellow] is occasionally awarded to DSI members for outstanding contributions in the field of decision sciences in at least two (2) of the following: research and scholarship, teaching and/or administration, and service to the Decision Sciences Institute.

'''Filminute''' is the international one-minute [[film festival]] dedicated to presenting, promoting and awarding the world's best one-minute [[w:films|films]]. Filminute was founded in 2005 and the inaugural festival ran in September 2006. Like other leading international Film Festivals, Filminute looks for films that deliver a well-balanced equation of content, [[w:acting|acting]], [[w:dialogue|dialogue]], [[w:storytelling|storytelling]], [[w:photography|photography]] and [[w:sound design|sound design]]. Filminute accepts films from the categories of [[w:fiction|fiction]], [[animation]], [[Documentary film|documentary]] and [[w:mashup (video)|mashup]].

==Information==
The annual festival and competition runs throughout the month of October. An international [[jury]] consisting of luminaries from the fields of [[filmmaking]], [[literature]], [[art]] and [[communications]] is responsible for the awarding of Best Filminute. [[Audiences]] worldwide are invited online to view and vote for the People's Choice Award.

Filminute 2006 featured submissions from 25 countries and attracted a worldwide, online audience from over 50 countries. Best Filminute honours went to Anton Groves for his UK-[[Romania]]n production ''Line''. The People's Choice Award was won by Wayne Campbell for his UK production ''It Could Be''.  According to [[Ekow Eshun]], artistic director of London's [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] and Filminute 2006 jury member, Filminute "demonstrated a high level of polish and a strong and exciting progression in user-generated content. Filminute has raised the bar in its first year and I am very interested to see how high the bar can go".

Filminute 2007 generated submissions from 45 countries, viewership from over 90 countries, and more than 2 million viewings of the shortlisted films online and on television. The jury-awarded Best Filminute went to Kristina Grozeva's ''Game'' ([[Bulgaria]]), while The People's Choice was awarded to Siddartha Jatla's ''Missing'' (India). During an October 2007 television interview with Filminute co-founder and executive director John Ketchum, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] journalist and host [[Evan Solomon]] described Filminute as "the future of modern storytelling".

Filminute 2008 drew submissions from 60 countries, viewership from 94 countries, and more than 3 million viewings of the shortlisted films online and on television. The jury-awarded Best Filminute went to Oli Hyatt's ''StitchUp Showdown - Gym Jam'' (UK) and The People's Choice was awarded to Pici Papai's ''Quick'' (Hungary). The 2008 festival attracted a great deal of media attention including that of [https://www.wired.com/ Wired.com] whose headline ran, "If those sprawling three-minute YouTube clips seem to drag on forever, Filminute, the international one-minute film festival, might be right up your alley."

Filminute 2009 drew submissions from 55 countries, audiences from 122 countries and more than 3 million viewings of the shortlisted films online and across a variety of media. The jury-awarded Best Filminute went to UK's Phil Sansom &amp; Olly Williams for their film ''Black Hole''. The People's Choice was awarded to Canada's James Cooper for ''Life''. The 2009 festival drew many positive reviews including Ronald Bergan's [[The Guardian|Guardian UK]] article "[https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/sep/04/filminute-film-festival One Hot Minute: How Long is a Piece of Film?]" which praised Filminute’s collection of "technically impressive mini-movies" and the festival’s commitment and focus "on story".

Filminute 2012 marked the second time an animation won Best Filminute, with Director Ant Blade’s ''Chop-Chop'' (UK) taking the top prize. As well, Ant Blade was only the third filmmaker in the festival’s eight-year history to have two films shortlisted in the same year. The People's Choice award was won by Ben Jacobson for his smirk-inducing drama ''Candy Crime'' (UK). In addition to a record 134 countries tuning in to see the films, and a surge in the number of comedies, 2012 also saw the festival’s eastern presence grow with strong shortlisted films from Lithuania, Georgia, Turkey, and Russia.

Filminute 2013 welcomed American independent filmmaking icon [[Richard Linklater]] to the jury who together with [[FIPRESCI]] film critic Carmen Gray and other luminaries awarded Best Filminute honours to Dutch filmmaker David Stevens for his excellent documentary ''M-22''.  At the same time, the big story at the festival's 8th edition was Martinique filmmaker Khris Burton’s film ''Maybe Another Time'' which won the People’s Choice and Top Rated awards, as well as finished 1st in the Jury Commendations. It was the strongest finish ever for a single film at the festival.

Filminute 2014 set new viewing records for the festival with over 5 million views recorded for the collection. Much of this was on the back of [[Ignacio Rodó]]'s moving thriller ''[[Tuck Me In]]'' (Spain) which won the jury-awarded Best Filminute. The People's Choice award went to André Marques' heartwarming film ''Grandpa'' (Portugal) which also impressed with a Jury Commendation, a runner-up ranking for Top Rated, as well as the inaugural Cineuropa Audience Award. The festival and films also garnered widespread international media attention including Hugh Hart's piece in Fast Company "[http://www.fastcocreate.com/3035648/60-second-knockouts-watch-5-cool-movies-in-5-minutes: 60-Second Knockouts]"

Filminute celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2015 with Guillaume Renusson's ground-breaking and powerful French sign-language film ''A Minute of Silence''. The film was the overwhelming choice of the international jury which included Oscar-winning producer (and Women In Film president) [[Cathy Schulman]], [[FIPRESCI]] General Secretary Klaus Eder, and advertising heavyweight [[Kevin Roberts (businessman)|Kevin Roberts]]. Multiple Filminute award-winner Khris Burton returned to take the People's Choice award for his dark and magical film ''Nanny'' (Martinique). And the Top Rated award went to Romania's George Molesag for his hard-hitting drama ''Rematch''. To celebrate the 10th anniversary, film critic Carlo Perassi teamed up with a Taste of Cinema to write the popular "[http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2015/the-10-best-one-minute-films-of-the-past-decade/: The Ten Best One-Minute Films of the Past Decade]"

Filminute 2016 was honoured to welcome renowned and prolific Taiwanese filmmaker [[Hou Hsiao-Hsien]] to the jury. Together with author [[John Vaillant]], [[FIPRESCI]] journalist Barbara Hollender and others, the jury awarded Best Filminute honours to Rohin Raveendran’s timely and moving film ''Paijana'' (India). The hilarious French animation ''Voltige'' won the People’s Choice Award (as well as over 100,000 views on Facebook alone). ''Cutting Room'' by Canadian directors Nathan White and Richard Colmer won the Top Rated award.

Filminute 2017 was delighted to welcome to the jury, Baronessa Beatrice Monti, the founder and president of the Santa Maddalena Foundation, the famed Tuscan writing retreat that has partnered with Filminute since the inaugural festival in 2006. Through its partnership with Women In Film, Filminute also welcomed the award-winning Ghanian-American film director Priscilla Anany.  Together with their fellow jurors they awarded Best Filminute honours to Iranian director Kaveh Jahed's tense and moving migrant thriller, ''A Share of a Share.'' The People's Choice award went to American director Jin Ryu for his docu-drama ''Megan.'' And the Top Rated award went to ''Comic Relief'' by Colombian director Carlos Andres Reyes. Filminute 2017 also saw the launch of the first Filminute Development Prize, sponsored by CineCoup.

The '''Florida Strawberry Festival''' is an annual event that takes place in [[Plant City, FL|Plant City]], [[Florida]]. It was started in 1930 by the local [[Lions Club]], a local philanthropy club dedicated to bettering the community, after several attempts by locals in the previous 20 years to promote the local [[strawberry]] crop. Beginning in 1929, The Lions Club worked to plan the festival honoring King Strawberry, the champion of the area's agricultural products. The festival lasts 11 days, and generates an attendance of about half a million patrons from all over Central Florida and other global nations. 

*The festival is a venue for [[flea market]]-style craft and item sales, various free entertainment acts/events, a very large midway, plus twice-daily "big name" musical concert performances.  Tickets are required for these concerts, there used to be free seating on a first come first searved basis, however after the 2017 festival the area was renovated with stadium seating and is no longer free. 2018 is the first year no free seating will be available.
*The festival is also known for its famous St. Clement Catholic Church's "Make Your Own" Strawberry [[Shortcake]]. which is shown on carnival eats on the cooking channel © and will be featured again in 2018. During their 46th year St. Clement Catholic Church's "Make Your Own" Strawberry [[Shortcake]] booth served it's 4 millionth strawberry shortcake on March 4, 2018.
*Every year a parade is held in the festivals honor and features Plant City's '''''Person Of the Year''''' award.
*The festival has livestock activities in conjunction with the local [[4-H]] club.
*The festival consistently outdraws the [[Florida State Fair]], held at the nearby [[Florida State Fairgrounds]].
*The festival also has a [[beauty pageant]], with the coronation of a &lt;strong&gt;Strawberry Queen&lt;/strong&gt;. Drew Knotts, a [[Plant City High School]] Senior was crowned 2017 Queen by outgoing Queen, Haley Riley. The beauty pageant is well described in "The Strawberry Girls" by Anne Hull, which appeared in the ''New Yorker magazine,'' August 11 &amp; 18, 2008.

'''Frederick William Rolfe''', better known as '''Baron Corvo''', and also calling himself 'Frederick William Serafino Austin Lewis Mary Rolfe',&lt;ref&gt;'I was baptized iii Jan. 1886 at St. Aloysius, Oxford, receiving the names "Frederick William". "Serafino" was conferred by Bishop Hugh Macdonald in Aberdeen Cathedral on my profession in the third order of St. Francis. "Austin Lewis Mary" were conferred by Cardinal Manning in the chapel of Archbishop's House, Westminster, at my confirmation.' A.J.A. Symons, ''The Quest for Corvo'', Cassell, 1934, p.188.&lt;/ref&gt; (22 July 1860 – 25 October 1913), was an English writer, artist, photographer and eccentric.

==Life==

[[File:VE - S. Michele - Tomba di Frederick Rolfe - Foto di G. Dall'Orto.jpg|left|thumb|Rolfe's grave on [[Isola di San Michele|San Michele]], Venice]]

Rolfe was born in [[Cheapside]], London, the son of a piano manufacturer. He left school at the age of fourteen and became a teacher. He taught briefly at [[The King's School, Grantham]], where the then headmaster, [[Ernest Hardy]], later principal of [[Jesus College, Oxford]], became a lifelong friend.

He converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1886 and was confirmed by [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]]. With his conversion came a strongly-felt vocation to the [[Holy Orders|priesthood]], which persisted throughout his life despite being constantly frustrated and never realised. In 1887 he was sponsored to train at [[St Mary's College, Oscott]] near [[Birmingham]] and in 1889 was a student at the [[The Scots College (Rome)|Scots College]] in Rome, but was thrown out by both due to his inability to concentrate on priestly studies, his "reputation as a [[pederast]]",&lt;ref&gt;"Rolfe, Frederick William", in ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature'' (1995), Springfield, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; and his erratic behaviour.

At this stage he entered the circle of the [[Caroline Shirley, Duchess Sforza Cesarini|Duchess Sforza Cesarini]], who, he claimed, adopted him as a grandson and gave him the use of the title of "Baron Corvo". This became his best-known pseudonym; he also called himself "Frank English", "Frederick Austin" and "A. Crab Maid", among others. More often he abbreviated his own name to "Fr. Rolfe" (an ambiguous usage, suggesting he was the priest he had hoped to become).

Rolfe spent most of his life as a freelance writer, mainly in England but eventually in [[Venice]]. He lived in the era before the welfare state, and relied on benefactors for support. But he had an argumentative nature and had a tendency to fall out spectacularly with most of the people who tried to help him and offer him room and board. Eventually, out of money and out of luck, he died in Venice from a stroke on 25 October 1913.  He was buried on the [[Isola di San Michele]], Venice.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.A. Symons, ''The Quest for Corvo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolfe's life provided the basis for ''The Quest for Corvo'' by [[A.J.A. Symons]], an "experiment in biography" regarded as a minor classic in the field. This same work reveals that Rolfe had an unlikely enthusiast in the person of [[Maundy Gregory]].

==Homosexuality==

Rolfe was entirely comfortable with his homosexuality and associated and corresponded with a number of other homosexual Englishmen. Early in his life he wrote a fair amount of idealistic but mawkish poetry about boy martyrs and the like. These and his Toto stories contain pederastic elements, but the young male pupils he was teaching at the time unanimously recalled in later life that there had never been any hint of impropriety in his relations with them. As he himself matured, Rolfe's settled sexual preference was for late adolescents. Towards the end of his life he made his only explicit reference to his specific sexual age preference, in one of the Venice letters to [[Charles Masson Fox]], in which he declared: "My preference was for the 16, 17, 18 and large."&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe to Fox, 13 January 1910, in Cecil Woolf ed., ''The Venice Letters'', Cecil &amp; Amelia Woolf, 1974, p.46. In a September 1909 letter to [[John Gambril Nicholson]], Rolfe discussed the subject of sex between a man and a boy, a matter, he told Nicholson, of which "you have the practical experience which I have not." (Miriam J Benkovitz, ''Frederick Rolfe: Baron Corvo'', Hamish Hamilton, 1977, p.248, quoting a letter in the Martyr Worthy Collection, Columbia University Library). Nicholson is the person Rolfe is least likely to have lied to about this.&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant Richards, in his ''Memories of a Misspent Youth'' (1932), recalls "Frederick Baron Corvo" at [[Parson's Pleasure]] in Oxford – where scholars could bathe naked – "surveying the yellow flesh tints of youth with unbecoming satisfaction".

Those of whom it is either speculated or surmised that they had sexual relations with Rolfe – Aubrey Thurstans, Sholto Osborne Gordon Douglas, John 'Markoleone', Ermenegildo Vianello and the other Venetian gondoliers – were all sexually mature young men between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one (with the exception of Douglas,&lt;ref&gt;This was Sholto Osborne Gordon Douglas (1873–1934), educated at Fettes College, Portsmouth Grammar School and Christ Church, Oxford, author of ''A Theory of Civilization'' (1914) and of several volumes of poetry, most notably ''Ungodly Jingles'' (1923).&lt;/ref&gt; who was considerably older). The idealised young men in his fiction were of a similar age.&lt;ref&gt;Toto in ''Stories Toto Told Me'', Tarquinio and Lucrezia in ''Don Tarquinio'', Renato and Eros in ''Don Renato'', and Zildo in ''The Desire and Pursuit of the Whole'' are all in their mid- to late-teens.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, soon after his ordination as a Roman Catholic priest, the convert [[Robert Hugh Benson]] formed a chaste but passionate friendship with Rolfe. For two years this relationship involved letters "not only weekly, but at times daily, and of an intimate character, exhaustingly charged with emotion." There was a falling out in 1906, and Benson satirised Rolfe in his novel ''The Sentimentalists''. Rolfe returned the favor a few years later, putting a caricature of Benson named "Bobugo Bonsen" in a book named ''Nicholas Crabbe''. Their letters were subsequently destroyed, probably by Benson's brother.&lt;ref&gt;David Hilliard, "UnEnglish and UnManly: Anglo-Catholicism and Homosexuality" in ''Victorian Studies'', Winter 1982, p.199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolfe sought to characterise the relationships in his fiction as examples of '[[Greek love]]' between an older man and an [[ephebos|ephebe]], and thus endow them with the sanction of the ancient Hellenic tradition familiar to all Edwardians with a classical education.

==Work==

===Principal works of fiction===
[[File:Don Tarquinio.JPG|thumb|right|Rolfe's design for ''Don Tarquinio'']]

Rolfe's most important and enduring works are the stories and novels in which he himself is the thinly-disguised protagonist:

*''Stories Toto Told Me'' (1898), a collection of six stories, later expanded to thirty-two and republished as ''In His Own Image'' (1901), in which ‘Don Friderico’ and his teenage acolytes embark on long walking tours in the Italian countryside, even as far from Rome as the eastern coast of Italy. The youths’ leader, the sixteen-year-old Toto, recounts tales of saints behaving like pagan gods. The stories are richly Catholic and unashamedly superstitious, and the saints who figure in them are hedonistic, revengeful and (though not licentious) entirely comfortable with nudity, diametric to any Protestant ideal of sainthood.
*''[[Hadrian the Seventh]]'' (1904), with an original and compelling plot, is Rolfe's most famous novel. Rolfe portrays himself as an Englishman with a quintessentially English name, 'George Arthur Rose,' (after [[Saint George]], [[King Arthur]], and England's national flower) who, having originally been rejected for the priesthood, finds himself the object of a spectacular and highly improbable change of mind on the part of the church hierarchy, who elect him to the papacy.  Rose takes the name Hadrian VII and embarks upon a programme of ecclesiastical and geopolitical reform; the only English pope was [[Hadrian IV]], and the last non-Italian pope had been [[Hadrian VI]].   More self-indulgently, he takes the opportunity to review his past life and to reward or punish his friends and acquaintances according to what he believes to be their just deserts.  ''Hadrian'' is thus essentially an exercise in wish-fulfilment.&lt;ref&gt;The book was very successfully adapted by Peter Luke as a stage production in London in 1968, in which the part of Hadrian/Rolfe was played by Alec McCowen. A further production starring Barry Morse played in Australia, on Broadway, and in a short United States national tour.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Nicholas Crabbe'' (written 1900–1904, published 1958) tells the story of Rolfe's first attempts to achieve publication, with starring roles for Henry Harland, John Lane and Grant Richards.  In this novel Rolfe has given himself a new fictional name, 'Nicholas Crabbe,' and its plot is a blow-by-blow chronicle of events, reproducing many of the publishers' letters and Rolfe's replies to them. ''Nicholas Crabbe'' is an undistinguished novel, but it is rich in autobiographical detail.
*''The Desire and Pursuit of the Whole'' (written 1910–1913, thought lost, found in [[Chatto &amp; Windus]]'s safe, published 1934) is set in Venice and reintroduces the reader to 'Nicholas Crabbe.' It has three interlocking plots: Crabbe’s efforts to get his books published, in the face of obstacles placed in their way by his friends and agents in England, and his consequent economic difficulties; his rescue of a sixteen-year-old girl from the [[1908 Messina earthquake|Messina earthquake]] and employment of her as his assistant and gondolier, dressed in male garments to avoid scandal; and the transcendent beauty of Venice itself and the role it plays in the lives of its votaries. Extracts from the novel’s beautiful descriptions of Venice appear regularly in guidebooks and modern anthologies. Unlike Rolfe’s other novels, this one ends happily, with a lucrative book contract and a declaration of love.&lt;ref&gt;See Andrew Eburne, 'Frederick Rolfe: The Desire and Pursuit of the Whole 1908–1912', DPhil thesis, University of Oxford, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; "The desire and pursuit of the whole" is the definition of love, according to [[Aristophanes]] in [[Plato]]'s [[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]].

In 1912, the year before his death, Rolfe began to write another autobiographical novel, ''The Freeing of the Soul, or The Seven Degrees'' (written 1912–1913, published 1995), of which only a few pages have survived.&lt;ref&gt;The five-page fragment is at MS Walpole c.11, and Rolfe’s notes for the novel at MS Walpole c.13, Bodleian Library, University of Oxford.  The full text of the fragment, edited by Andrew Eburne, may be found in ''English Literature in Transition 1880–1920'', Volume 38 Number 4, 1995, pp.492–495.&lt;/ref&gt;  Set in the fifth century, the novel was to have as its protagonist a middle-aged Byzantine bishop named Septimius, preoccupied with the likelihood of another of the barbarian attacks which had been terrifying his Venetian flock. The novel was a departure for Rolfe, as his four previous autobiographical works had been set in his own time.

===Other writings===

Rolfe wrote four other novels: ''Don Tarquinio'' (1905), ''Don Renato'' (1909), ''The Weird of the Wanderer'' (1912), and ''Hubert’s Arthur'' (published posthumously in 1935).  Both ''The Weird'' and ''Hubert’s Arthur'' were collaborations with [[Harry Pirie-Gordon]].  These works differ from the autobiographical novels in two respects: they are set in previous centuries, and the principal protagonist in each is not Rolfe’s ''alter ego'', although there is a strong degree of identification.  (In ''The Weird of the Wanderer'' the hero, Nicholas Crabbe, becomes a time traveller and discovers that he is [[Odysseus]].)

Rolfe also wrote shorter fiction, published in contemporary periodicals and collected after his death in ''Three Tales of Venice'' (1950), ''Amico di Sandro'' (1951), ''The Cardinal Prefect of Propaganda'' (1957) and ''The Armed Hands'' (1974).  He also published an entertaining but unreliable work of history, ''Chronicles of the House of Borgia'' (1901), translations of ''The Rubáiyát of 'Umar Khaiyám'' (1903) and ''The Songs of Meleager'' (published posthumously in 1937), and a little poetry, later gathered into one volume, ''Collected Poems'' (1974).

===Letters===

Rolfe was an enthusiastic letter writer.  John Holden recalled that "Corvo was one of those men who never speak a word if they can write it. We lived in the same house, a very little one, yet he would always communicate with me by note if I was not in the same room with him. He had dozens of letter books. He seized upon every opportunity for writing a letter, and every letter, whether to a publisher or to a cobbler, was written with the same care."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Scoble ed., ''The Colt &amp; The Porcupine: Four Letters from John Holden to A J A Symons'', Callum James Books, 2007, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;  About a thousand of his letters have survived, and several sequences of them have been published in limited editions.  The letters reveal a lively, intelligent and absorbent mind, but because of Rolfe’s paranoiac tendencies they are often disputatious and recriminatory.  Among the commentators who rated Rolfe’s letters more highly than his fiction was W H Auden, who wrote that Rolfe "had every right to be proud of his verbal claws … A large vocabulary is essential to the invective style, and Rolfe by study and constant practice became one of the great masters of vituperation."&lt;ref&gt;W H Auden, ‘Foreword’ to the second impression of ''The Desire and Pursuit of the Whole'', Cassell, 1953, pp.vii-viii.&lt;/ref&gt; The letters have yet to be collected into a single scholarly edition.

==Photography and painting==

===Photography===
[[File:ImageRolfetitobiondi1890roma.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Tito Biondi at Lake Nemi'' (photograph by Rolfe, ca. 1890–92)]]

Rolfe took an interest in photography throughout his life, but never achieved any more than basic competence. While he began to experiment with photography when he was a schoolmaster, it was his time in Rome in 1889–90 that introduced him to the work of the 'Arcadian' photographers [[Wilhelm von Gloeden]] and [[Guglielmo Plüschow]]. His seminary, the Scots College, was quite close to Plüschow's studio in via Sardegna, just off the via Veneto, and when Rolfe was expelled from the College and came under the benevolent patronage of the [[Caroline Shirley, Duchess Sforza Cesarini|Duchess Sforza Cesarini]], he began his own photographic efforts in imitation of von Gloeden and Plüschow. His models were the local ''ragazzi'' from the streets of [[Genzano di Roma]], a town dominated by the Duchess's ''palazzo''. These youths were later to become the principal characters in Rolfe's Toto stories, published first in ''[[The Yellow Book]]'' in 1895–96 and later collected in ''Stories Toto Told Me'' in 1898 and ''In His Own Image'' in 1901.

Rolfe continued to indulge his interest in photography in Christchurch in 1890–91, upon his return from Rome, and experimented with colour and underwater pictures. He began to lose interest, however, and really only took photography up again when he returned to Italy in 1908. His photographic career has been fully documented in Donald Rosenthal's book ''The Photographs of Frederick Rolfe Baron Corvo 1860–1913'', which was published in 2008.

===Painting===

Rolfe never lost his conviction that he had been called to the Catholic priesthood. When he worked in his late teens and early twenties as a schoolmaster, and later when he tried his hand at painting and photography, he saw these as stop-gap occupations, means of earning an income until the Church authorities came to their senses and agreed with his own firm view that he had a priestly vocation.

It was for this reason that Rolfe never undertook any formal training in either painting or photography. His paintings and designs, including several for the covers of his own books, were bold and surprisingly accomplished amateur efforts. He executed some of the most impressive of them when he was living in Christchurch in 1890 and 1891, including a small but striking oil painting of St Michael.

From 1895 to 1899 he lived in [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] in North Wales, where he painted some fourteen processional banners, commissioned by the parish priest there, Fr [[Charles Sidney Beauclerk]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Scoble, ''Frederick Rolfe's Holywell Banners'', Callum James Books, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Rolfe painted the figures of the saints and John Holden assisted with the lettering on the borders. Only five of the banners have survived, and may still be seen in the Holywell Well Museum; they are colourful representations, in a naive style, of Saints Winefride, George, Ignatius, Gregory the Great and Augustine of Canterbury.

Rolfe produced no further paintings after he became a full-time writer.

==Posthumous literary reputation==

Rolfe's early books were politely reviewed but none of them was enough of a success to secure an income for its author, whose posthumous reputation began to dim. Within a very few years, however, coteries of readers began to discover a common interest in his work, and a resilient literary cult began to form.  In 1934 [[A. J. A. Symons]] published ''The Quest for Corvo'', one of the century's iconic biographies, and this brought Rolfe's life and work to the attention of a wider public. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a further surge of interest in him which became known as "the Corvo revival", including a successful adaptation of ''Hadrian'' for the London stage. Two biographies of Rolfe appeared in the 1970s. These led to his inclusion in all the major works of reference and engendered a stream of academic theses on him. Although his books have remained in print, no substantial monograph has ever appeared in English on his work.&lt;ref&gt;There is one work in Italian: Carla Marengo Vaglio, ''Frederick Rolfe Baron Corvo'', Mursia, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; With the growing academic interest in the history of literary modernism and acknowledgement of the central importance of life writing in its genesis, the true importance of Rolfe’s [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fictions]] has come into focus.  His influence has been discerned in novels written by [[Henry Harland]], [[Ronald Firbank]],&lt;ref&gt;See David Dougill, 'Firbank: A Long Look', in ''Books and Bookmen'', Vol 18, May 1973, p.36. Dougill appends to his article a short bibliography of the evidence for the influence of Rolfe on Firbank.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graham Greene]],&lt;ref&gt;Greene's biographer claimed that Pinkie, the protagonist in "Brighton Rock", was based on Rolfe. See Norman Sherry, "The Life of Graham Greene": Volume One 1904–1939, Jonathan Cape, 1989, p.645.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Theroux]],&lt;ref&gt;See Steven Moore, "Alexander Theroux's ''Darconville's Cat'' and the Tradition of Learned Wit," ''Contemporary Literature'' 27.2 (Summer 1986): 235.&lt;/ref&gt; and in his coinage of neologisms and use of the [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] story there is some perhaps coincidental prefiguring of the work of [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;The similarities between the work of Rolfe and Joyce were first remarked upon by Stuart Gilbert: ‘Had the Fates been kinder, that unhappy genius might have moved parallel, if on a somewhat lower plane, to Joyce’s. Nicolas {{sic}} Crabbe…had a good deal in common with [[Stephen Dedalus]].' (''James Joyce's Ulysses: A Study'', Faber, 1952, p.95).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homegrown''' was a monthly [[drum and bass]] event held at Mercury Live, [[Cape Town]]. It featured several international and local acts, including [[Dieselboy]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Counterstrike (drum and bass group)|Counterstrike]], [[Donny (drum and bass artist)|Donny]], [[Offkey Recordings|Raiden]], [[Eye-D]], Matt Impact, Robyn Chaos, Temper D, Nymfo, [[DJ SFR|SFR]] and Hyphen.

Owned and managed by Algorythm Recordings, the event took place every first Saturday of the month, and was the longest running drum and bass event in South Africa. The last Homegrown was held on 3 November 2012. It has subsequently spawned a successor event called 'Pressure', which occupies Homegrown's original venue and schedule, hosted by SFR, Hyphen, and RudeOne.

==History==
The first Homegrown event was held in September 2000 at The Jam (now Mercury Live).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.flickr.com/photos/23594293@N02/2249702763/in/set-72157603872463865/ | accessdate=6 October 2009 | publisher= [[Flickr]] | title=First ever Homegrown flyer | date= September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was masterminded by Algorythm Recordings. The idea behind it is to get South African drum and bass crews Algorythm, Sublime and Krushed &amp; Sorted under one roof, once a month, for the first time. The focus is promoting artists who produce drum and bass locally, hence the name "Homegrown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.dnbforum.nl/index.php?op=articles;id=255 | accessdate=6 October 2009 | publisher= dnbforum.nl | title= Counterstrike interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Mercury Live offered Homegrown a monthly residency, making it a permanent fixture in the [[Music_of_South_Africa#Drum_and_bass|South African drum and bass]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mercuryl.co.za/gigs.php | accessdate=6 October 2009 | publisher= Mercury Live | title=Monthly gig list}}&lt;/ref&gt; With drum and bass music requiring well-engineered, large sound systems, Algorythm developed a long working relationship with Hellfire Sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.hellfire.co.za/ | accessdate=6 October 2009 | publisher= Hellfire | title= Homegrown sound system}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist line-ups==
Since its establishment in 2000, Homegrown has hosted a large range of artists, with headlining acts including [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Counterstrike (drum and bass group)|Counterstrike]], [[Dieselboy]], [[Donny (drum and bass artist)|Donny]], [[Offkey Recordings|Raiden]], [[Eye-D]], Matt Impact, Robyn Chaos, Temper D, MC Messinian and Nymfo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.flickr.com/photos/23594293@N02/sets/72157603872463865 | accessdate=6 October 2009 | publisher= All Homegrown flyers | title= Collection of flyers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Please do not extend this list without good reason - take it to the talk page --&gt;

The monthly event has also been a launching platform for [[Music_of_South_Africa#Drum_and_bass|South African drum and bass]] artists, with various acts such as [[DJ SFR|SFR]], RudeOne, MFU, Niskerone, MC Skywalker, Psyke and the Anti Alias performing multiple times. Resident DJs include [[Counterstrike (drum and bass group)|Counterstrike]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_Vg7LpNHks  | accessdate=6 October 2009 | publisher= YouTube | title=Counterstrike}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hyphen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2318233922 | accessdate=6 October 2009 | publisher= Facebook | title= Event line ups}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Please do not extend this list without good reason - take it to the talk page --&gt;
==Flyer==
Printed on [[perforated paper]], Homegrown flyers are commonly used as [[joint (cannabis)#Variations|gerrick]] or filters in the preparation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] smoking. Early flyer and logo designs depicted images of marijuana plants and leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.flickr.com/photos/23594293@N02/2249700011/in/set-72157603872463865/ | accessdate=6 October 2009 | publisher= Algorythm Recordings flyer archive | title= Early Homegrown flyer design}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later changed to appeal to a much wider audience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.flickr.com/photos/23594293@N02/3745956936/ | accessdate=6 October 2009 | publisher= [[Flickr]] | title= More recent Homegrown flyer design}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the perforated flyer is still in use.

Recent Homegrown flyers have contained [[QR Code]]s, storing URL data to downloadable MP3 and [[Computer wallpaper|desktop wallpapers]]. All flyers and event visuals are designed by Eaton Crous himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.dnbforum.nl/index.php?op=articles;id=255  | accessdate=6 October 2009 | publisher= dnbforum.nl | title= Counterstrike interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival''' was founded in 1994 by Ian Smith and his son Neil and is held every summer in England. The two- or three-week Festival of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] performances and fringe events attracts thousands of visitors, including performers, supporters, and G&amp;S enthusiasts from around the world. Beginning in 2014, [[Harrogate]], North Yorkshire, has hosted the Festival, which was held in [[Buxton]], Derbyshire, from 1994 to 2013.  

At the Festival, up to a dozen amateur Gilbert and Sullivan performing societies from around the world compete on the Festival's main stage each year for awards including "International Champion". At the weekends there are professional Gilbert and Sullivan performances, including performances each year by the Festival's homegrown [[National Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera Company]]. A smaller nearby theatre and other venues host the Festival fringe, which consists of dozens of performances and lectures, a memorabilia fair, and other events.

==History==
The Festival was founded in 1994 and continues to be produced by English businessman Ian Smith, his son Neil, and their family to preserve and enhance the knowledge, understanding and appreciation of the works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. It also has a goal of reinstating G&amp;S and the performing arts in schools in Britain. On several occasions, the Festival added a week of performances in the United States. The founders believe that the Gilbert and Sullivan works are an important national heritage and legacy, especially as performed in the tradition of the venerable, year-round [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], which performed [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Savoy Opera]]s continuously, year-round, for over a century until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, pp. 49–50; Joseph, p. 358. Between 1988 and 2003, a seasonal company used the name D'Oyly Carte. See Bradley, pp. 54–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skow, John. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921136,00.html 1982 "Music: Final Curtain for D'Oyly Carte"]. ''Time'' magazine, 8 March 1982, accessed 7 July 2010. Until the Gilbert and Sullivan copyrights expired in 1961, no other professional theatre or opera companies were allowed to present the Savoy Operas in Britain, although professional companies performed the operas elsewhere, and numerous amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies performed around the world. After 1961 other professional companies began to perform the operas in Britain. See Bradley, chapters four and six; and Hewett, Ivan. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/5931987/The-magic-of-Gilbert-and-Sullivan.html "The Magic of Gilbert and Sullivan"]. ''The Telegraph'', 2 August 2009, accessed 14 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; When that company closed in 1982, greatly diminishing the amount of Gilbert and Sullivan produced in Britain, Ian Smith "had a burning anger" that the  [[Arts Council of Great Britain|English Arts Council]] had not subsidised the company, and this led him to found the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, pp. 45 and 197–98&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival was held in [[Buxton]], England, every year from 1994 to 2013, but it has experimented with producing additional Festival weeks in other towns or cities, including [[Eastbourne]], England once; [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, twice; [[Berkeley, California]], once;&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.gs-festival.co.uk/history.aspx Festival history pages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandhamfest&gt;Sandham, David.

===The competition===
[[File:Savoynet Yeomen 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from SavoyNet's ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard|Yeomen]]'', the Festival winner in 2013]]
At the core of the Festival is a competition among amateur G&amp;S performing troupes from Britain and around the world.&lt;ref name=Press2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beale, Robert. [http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music/blow-down-gilbert--sullivan-5328030 "Blow me down! Gilbert &amp; Sullivan bows out of Buxton"], ''Manchester Evening News'', 26 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the Festival, on weeknights, "the best non-professional groups from the UK and overseas compete for the International Champions title."&lt;ref name=SkyArts/&gt; The day of performance for each amateur group is hectic, with move-in to the theatre at 9 a.m., lighting call at 11 a.m., their one and only tech-dress rehearsal (with the Festival orchestra) in the afternoon, the performance in the evening, and move-out immediately afterwards.&lt;ref name=Press2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Press3/&gt; A professional adjudicator [[critique]]s each amateur performance immediately after the curtain falls. The adjudicator then scores each performance, and both group and individual awards are announced at the end of the Festival.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;Lee, Bernard.

At the first Festival in 1994, first prize was awarded to the production of ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' presented by the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Society of [[Maine]], in the US (then known as the G&amp;S Society of [[Hancock County, Maine|Hancock County]]). The [[Derby Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Company]] has won the first prize more often than any other company (six times); and the South Anglia Savoy Players has won five times and placed second four times. Festival Productions, Ireland, won in three consecutive years, 2007 to 2009. Individual awards are also presented for performers, directors and musical directors.&lt;ref&gt;Sandham, David.

Some groups compete year after year at the Festival, but some companies, especially those travelling from North America, South Africa, Australia and other distant places, may visit only occasionally or once. Some groups meet and rehearse entirely at the Festival, including the internet group SavoyNet, which has competed each year since 1997. SavoyNet were Festival Champions in 2013 and 2018 and are the first and only company thus far to present all 14 G&amp;S operas at the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival souvenir programme, 2018, p. 39; [https://www.noda.org.uk/societies/savoynet-performing-group "Savoynet Performing Group"], National Operatic &amp; Dramatic Association, accessed 19 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ian (presenter).

===Venues and fringe events===
[[File:Harrogate Theatre boxes and house.jpg|thumb|left|Interior view of the Harrogate Theatre]]
All of the competition performances and the weekend professional performances are given on the Festival's main stage. From 1994 to 2013, that was the [[Frank Matcham]]-designed 900-seat [[Buxton Opera House]].&lt;ref name=PAC/&gt; Beginning in 2014, the main stage has been the 1,100-seat [[Royal Hall, Harrogate|Royal Hall]] in Harrogate, another Matcham-designed theatre. These performances are nearly always accompanied by the "National Festival Orchestra".&lt;ref name=Press2/&gt; A review of a 2010 performance noted, "The music was up to [the Festival's] usual high standard, with the orchestra (leader, Sally Robinson) ... giving a superb and sprightly reading of the Overture and score throughout."&lt;ref name=Iolanthe2010/&gt; The Festival also hosts dozens of performances and fringe activities in smaller venues. In Buxton, these included the 360-seat Pavilion Arts Centre.&lt;ref name=PAC&gt;Woolman, Natalie. [http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/29520/buxton-opera-house-to-open-new-pavilion-arts "Buxton Opera House to open new Pavilion arts venue"]. ''The Stage'', 7 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsletter&gt;[http://www.gs-festival.co.uk/files/GSnewsJune07.pdf June 2007 Festival Newsletter, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; In Harrogate, some fringe performances have been held in the 500-seat Harrogate Theatre and others at various venues in and around the town, including at the Festival's purpose-built Savoy theatre.&lt;ref name=Wear/&gt;&lt;ref name=Press2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Press3&gt;Smith, Ian. [http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1998856 "A Summer Bursting at the Seams with Glorious Gilbert &amp; Sullivan"], ''Digital Journal'', 19 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fringe" activities have included performances, master classes and lectures by members of the original [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] (such as [[Valerie Masterson]], [[Thomas Round]], [[Gillian Knight]], [[Kenneth Sandford]], [[John Ayldon]] and [[John Reed (actor)|John Reed]]) and other professionals, and a late night Festival Club, where cabaret performances are given each evening after the opera, and sometimes a G&amp;S singalong is conducted.&lt;ref name=Sandhamfest/&gt; Recent years have included scholarly symposia,&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Raymond J.

===Effect and allure of the Festival===
The Festival serves as a "lightning-rod" of G&amp;S activity worldwide. G&amp;S performers and audiences from one part of the world can see performances by groups from other parts of the world.  Performances in the traditional style mix with ''avant garde'' ones, and G&amp;S scholars can communicate with a wide audience of enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature in ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan News'' noted: "The amateur performances were of a very high standard. ... There is a lovely atmosphere ... of Gilbert and Sullivan thriving, being enjoyed, and drawing everyone together as a family."&lt;ref&gt;Dufty, Jean. "Buxton Gilbert and Sullivan Festival, 1998" in ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan News'' vol. II, no. 13, p. 8 (Autumn, Winter 1998), The Gilbert and Sullivan Society, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fest2010/&gt; The Festival has developed "a reputation for being one of the friendliest musical festivals anywhere, with people returning year after year to soak up its special atmosphere."&lt;ref name=Fest2010&gt;Walker, Raymond J. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/sandh/2010/Jul-Dec10/buxton_GandS_Fest.htm "Buxton International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival 2010"]. MusicWeb International, accessed 6 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Festival aims to raise awareness and funds for its organizers' efforts to re-introduce G&amp;S into British schools.&lt;ref name=Schools2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grows/&gt; The Festival has been featured in several British television shows and in the documentary films ''Oh Mad Delight''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.49-north.com/ohmaddelight/index.html Article on the film ''Oh Mad Delight''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928091734/http://www.49-north.com/ohmaddelight/index.html |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Source of Innocent Merriment''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.49-north.com/innocent_merriment/home.html Article on the film ''A Source of Innocent Merriment''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223034131/http://www.49-north.com/innocent_merriment/home.html |date=2006-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky Arts broadcast its features about the Festival and Gilbert and Sullivan several times in 2010.&lt;ref name=SkyArts/&gt;

'''''Laurel and Hardy''''' is an American animated television series and an updated version of [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]]'s comedic acts by the animation studio [[Hanna-Barbera]] from Hal Roach. A total of 156 shorts were made, each having its own opening and closing wrap-arounds, to make them easy to air in syndication. In a majority of the cartoons, after Laurel and Hardy get into a mess of trouble, almost each one of them ends with Laurel whimpering in a high register. As both [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]] had died by the time of this series (Laurel died a year before the series went to air), [[Larry Harmon]] (who also produced the cartoons) and [[Jim MacGeorge]] respectively provided the voices of Stan and Ollie. They would later reprise their roles in an episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''.

The '''Lyric Theatre''', also known as the '''Lyric Hammersmith''', is a theatre in King Street, in the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]], which takes pride in its original, "groundbreaking" productions.&lt;ref name=AboutLyric&gt;[http://www.lyric.co.uk/about/ "About the Lyric"], ''Lyric'' official website. Retrieved 9 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Lyric Theatre was originally a music hall established in 1888 on Bradmore Grove, Hammersmith. Success as an entertainment venue led it to be rebuilt and enlarged on the same site twice, firstly in 1890 and then in 1895 by the English theatrical architect [[Frank Matcham]]. The 1895 re-opening, as The New Lyric Opera House, was accompanied by an opening address by the famous actress [[Lillie Langtry]].&lt;ref&gt;The Era classified ads 13 July 1895 online. Retrieved 27 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the theatre was due to be closed and demolished. However, a successful campaign to save it led to the auditorium being dismantled and re-installed piece by piece within a modern shell on its current site on King Street a short distance from the former Bradmore Grove location. The relocated theatre opened in 1979.&lt;ref name=Earl&gt;John Earl, [http://www.frankmatchamsociety.org.uk/magazine.html "Presidential Address: The Crest of a Wave"], ''[[Frank Matcham]] Society Magazine'', n.d.. Retrieved 19 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has two main performance areas: the ''Main House'', a 550-seat 19th-century auditorium maintaining the original design which hosts its main productions; and the 120-seat ''Studio'', which houses smaller productions by up-and-coming companies. The Lyric also presents frequent ''Lyric Children'' and ''Lyric Music'' performances as well as ''Sunday Night Comedy''.&lt;ref name=AboutLyric/&gt;

Its current artistic director is [[Sean Holmes]], and its executive director is Sian Alexander.&lt;ref name=AboutLyricCompany&gt;[http://www.lyric.co.uk/about/our-staff/ "About the Lyric: Our Staff"], ''Lyric'' official website. Retrieved 19 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lyric has recently gone through a major re-development project, with new facilities for young people and the local community completed in 2015, designed by [[Rick Mather]] Architects&lt;ref name=CapitalDevelopment&gt;[http://www.lyric.co.uk/support-us/capital-development/ "Capital Development"], ''Lyric'' official website. Retrieved 20 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated in the 'community benefit' and 'tourism and leisure' categories at the RICS Awards 2016, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rics.org/uk/training-events/awards/rics-awards-london/|title = RICS Awards, London|last = Surveyors|first = Royal Institution of Chartered|publisher = rics.org|language = en|access-date = 15 March 2016|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160315212850/http://www.rics.org/uk/training-events/awards/rics-awards-london/|archivedate = 15 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Lyric won the [[Olivier Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre for [[Sean Holmes]]' production of [[Sarah Kane]]'s ''[[Blasted]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item114061/Outstanding-Achievement-in-an-Affiliate-Theatre/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110714235731/http://www.olivierawards.com/nominations/view/item114061/Outstanding-Achievement-in-an-Affiliate-Theatre/ |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, it was announced that Sean Holmes would be succeeded as artistic director in February 2019 by [[Rachel O'Riordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/theatre/rachel-oriordan-announced-as-new-lyric-hammersmith-artistic-director-a3930086.html|title=Rachel O'Riordan will take over from Sean Holmes at Lyric Hammersmith|author=|date=|website=standard.co.uk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival, founded in 1988, is the primary fundraising event for Wilkes Community College and attracts crowds consistently exceeding 75,000 in number, making it one of the largest music festivals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.journalnow.com/relishnow/merlefest/merlefest-sees-bump-in-attendance/article_3aef09b0-ed2f-11e4-8366-db4c85d53b34.html)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the festival brings over $10 million in business and tourist revenue to Wilkes County and surrounding areas each year.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.journalpatriot.com/news/edc-hears-statistics-on-merlefest/article_ad6b910a-a28f-11e5-84fb-a78e02ab632a.html)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The music is spread across 13 different stages and four days, which provides festival visitors with a wide variety of musical venues, groups, and styles to choose from.&lt;ref&gt;(http://merlefest.org/about)&lt;/ref&gt; MerleFest offers a mix of traditional and contemporary roots music, a music blend that Doc himself named "traditional plus."

'''Milan Fashion Week''' ({{lang-it|Settimana della moda}}) is a clothing [[trade show]] held semi-annually in [[Milan]], [[Italy]]. The autumn/winter event is held in February/March of each year, and the spring/summer event is held in September/October of each year.

==History and operations==
Milan Fashion Week, established in 1958, is part of the global "Big Four [[fashion week]]s", the others being [[Paris Fashion Week]], [[London Fashion Week]] and [[New York Fashion Week]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradford|first1=Julie|title=Fashion Journalism|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2xeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Susan|last=Dillon|title=The Fundamentals of Fashion Management|publisher= A&amp;C Black|year=2011|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XFMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schedule begins with New York, followed by London, and then Milan, and ending with Paris. 

Milan Fashion Week is partially organized by {{lang|it|Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana}} (The National Chamber for Italian Fashion), a [[non-profit association]] which disciplines, co-ordinates and promotes the development of Italian fashion&lt;ref name="Giorgio Armani Joins Italian Chamber of Fashion"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/giorgio-armani-to-join-italian-chamber-of-fashion-7284417?src=n/newsAlert/20131120-4 | title=Giorgio Armani Joins Italian Chamber of Fashion | publisher=WWD | date=20 November 2013 | accessdate=20 November 2013 | author=Zargani,  Luisa }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is responsible for hosting the fashion events and shows of Milan. The {{lang|it|Camera Sindacale della Moda Italiana}}, was set up on 11 June 1958. This was the forerunner of the body which subsequently became the {{lang|it|Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana}}. 

Proprietors of the most important establishments in Italy, including some private establishments, which, in those days, played a crucial role in the promotion of this sector, were present at the Memorandum of Association: [[Roberto Capucci]], [[Emilio Schuberth]], Maria Antonelli, Princess Caracciolo Ginnetti, Alberto Fagiani, Giovanni Cesare Guidi, [[Germana Marucelli]], Simonetta Colonna Di Cesarò, [[Jole Veneziani]], Francesco Borrello, Giovanni Battista Giorgini, and the lawyer Pietro Parisio.

The events dedicated to women's fashion are the most important (Womenswear / Milan SS Women Ready to Wear, and Milano Moda Donna being the major fashion shows). The summer events dedicated to men include Menswear and Milano Moda Uomo. 

In 2013 the autumn/winter Milan Fashion Week started on 20 January with Paola Frani, and was followed by shows from major fashion houses such as [[Armani]], [[Roberto Cavalli]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], [[Etro]], [[Fendi]], [[Ferragamo]], [[Gucci]], [[Jil Sander]], [[Marni (clothing)|Marni]], [[Max Mara]], [[Missoni]], [[Moschino]], [[Philipp Plein]], [[Prada]], [[Pucci]], [[John Richmond (fashion designer)|John Richmond]], [[Tod's]], [[Versace]] etc. but also by shows from new labels and younger designers such as Au jour le jour, Cristiano Burani, Gabriele Colangelo, Marco De Vincenzo, Stella Jean, Chicca Lualdi, MSGM, N°21, Fausto Puglisi, Francesco Scognamiglio etc. On 20 November 2013, [[Giorgio Armani]] announced he has decided to join the Italian Chamber of Fashion.&lt;ref name="Giorgio Armani Joins Italian Chamber of Fashion"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/giorgio-armani-to-join-italian-chamber-of-fashion-7284417?src=n/newsAlert/20131120-4 | title=Giorgio Armani Joins Italian Chamber of Fashion | publisher=WWD | date=20 November 2013 | accessdate=20 November 2013 | author=Zargani,  Luisa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Carlo Capasa was named president of the Camera Nazionale Della Moda Italiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fashiontimes.com/articles/19958/20150410/carlo-capasa-named-president-camera-nazionale-della-moda-italiana.htm|title=Carlo Capasa Named President Of The Camera Nazionale Della Moda Italiana|date=2015-04-10|website=Fashion Times|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain shows are not held in conjunction with the Camera Nazionale Della Moda Italiana, including [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]]. The Camera Nazionale Della Moda Italiana has also been sharply criticized by designers such as [[Roberto Cavalli|Cavalli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/cavalli-kvetches-6287662/|title=Roberto Cavalli Lashes Out at Camera Nazionale della Moda|last=Turra|first=Alessandra|website=WWD|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
Milan fashion week including more than 40 shows each season transforms the city into a touristic hob by simply creating various venues for the shows selecting the most elegant and influential palaces to become the stage for design. Example of location are [[Palazzo Reale]], [[Palazzo Serbelloni|palazzo serbelloni]] and many others.

==Controversy==
{{see|Sustainable fashion}}
In 2014 [[Greenpeace]] protested to demand "toxic-free fashion" by hanging signs in the [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]].&lt;ref name="Greenpeace Activists Protest at Milan Fashion Week"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/greenpeace-protests-7487320?src=nl/mornReport/20140220 | title=Greenpeace Activists Protest at Milan Fashion Week | publisher=WWD | date=20 February 2014 | accessdate=20 February 2014 | author=Bani, Alessia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiara Campione of Greenpeace Italy said the demonstration was set up to "...ask Italian brands, especially Versace, because it has the highest level of hazardous chemicals in its products, to publicly commit to eliminate harmful substances from the various stages of production."

'''''Nedeljnik''''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Недељник) is a weekly [[newsmagazine]] published in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].

Since October 2012 ''Nedeljnik'' has been published by an independent group of journalists, who are also the magazine’s founders.

==Profile==
The publishers of ''Nedeljnik'' consider its primary audience to be urban and educated people. There is particularly large popularity/interest for the interviews with the world leaders/influencers, which have been, for years, ignored in Serbia. Nedeljnik published interviews with Lech Walesa, Noam Chomsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressonline.rs/info/politika/266554/noam-comski-pitanje-je-vremena-kada-cete-priznati-kosovo.html |title=Press Online :: Politika :: Noam Čomski: Pitanje je vremena kada ćete priznati Kosovo! |publisher=Pressonline.rs |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Forbes, Michael Bloomberg, Carla del Ponte, Romano Prodi, and similar. Nedeljnik also interviewed the most influential Serbian politicians and intellectuals, and provided reports such as the ‘confession’ of Boris Tadić&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Veljko Lalić, glavni i odgovorni urednik Pressa |url=http://www.pressonline.rs/vesti/Nedeljnik/197056/tadic-u-decanima---intervju-kakav-niste-citali.html |title=Press Online :: Nedeljnik :: Tadić u Dečanima - intervju kakav niste čitali |publisher=Pressonline.rs |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Visoki Dečani or the first national interview of the then newly appointed President of Serbia, Tomislav Nikolić.
 
One of the most popular columns in the magazine is OTVORENO (open), which invites prominent people, intellectuals and politicians to write their views and commentaries. So far, the Prime Minister of Serbia Ivica Dačić, in the New Year’s edition, wrote about new Serbian patriotism and kept diary twice during his state visits (once from Washington and the other time from the Olympic Games in London), Serbian President Tomislav Nikolić wrote a diary from Rome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/347309/Rimski-dnevnik-Tomislava-Nikolica-Lepi-su-espreso-i-torta-kapri-ali-bolji-su-srpska-kafa-i-sumadijska-hrana |title=Blic Online &amp;#124; Rimski dnevnik Tomislava Nikolića: Lepi su espreso i torta "kapri", ali bolji su srpska kafa i šumadijska hrana |publisher=Blic.rs |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was a text by the President of the Republic Srpska Milorad Dodik, but also other leading people in business, culture and science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5991">'''Outraging public decency''' is a [[common law offence]] in [[England and Wales]]&lt;ref name="halsbury"&gt;[[Halsbury's Laws of England]] 5th edition, volume 26, paragraph 717&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hong Kong]]. It is punishable by unlimited imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.&lt;ref name="halsbury"/&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=February 2011}}

==Definition==
Modern [[case law]] has established two elements that must be satisfied for the offence to have been committed:&lt;ref name="lawcom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Simplification of Criminal Law: Public Nuisance and Outraging Public Decency (Consultation Paper No. 193)|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/lawcommission/docs/cp193_Simplification_Public_Nuisance_Consultation.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602093854/http://www.justice.gov.uk/lawcommission/docs/cp193_Simplification_Public_Nuisance_Consultation.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 June 2011|publisher=[[Law Commission]]|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2007/2062.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[2007] EWCA Crim 2062, [2008] QB 224 para 21 (CA)&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
# the act was of such a lewd character as to outrage public decency; this element constitutes the nature of the act, which has to be proved before the offence can be established, and
# the act took place in a public place and must have been capable of being seen by two or more persons who were actually present, even if they did not actually see it.

==Usage==
The offence is currently prosecuted around 400-500 times per year in England and Wales.&lt;ref name="lawcom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ninetyone.org/policehistory/sources/files/commonlawoffences.pdf Common Law Offences Charged and Reaching a First Hearing in Magistrates' Courts], [[Crown Prosecution Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable criminal prosecutions==
===The foetus earrings case===
In December 1987 an artist, [[Rick Gibson]], exhibited a pair of earrings made with freeze-dried human foetuses at the Young Unknowns Gallery in London. On Thursday 3 December 1987 the earrings were seized by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Fletcher | first = David | title = 8-Week Foetuses Used to Make Pendant Earrings | newspaper= Daily Telegraph | pages= 3 | location= London | date= 5 December 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 11 April 1988, on the advice of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]],  Gibson and the gallery owner, Peter Sylveire, were formally charged with the [[common law offences]] of exhibiting a public nuisance and outraging public decency. This was the first occasion on which the charge of outraging public decency had been preferred in more than 80 years. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Artist Charged Over Foetuses | newspaper= Daily Telegraph | pages= 2 | location= London | date= 11 March 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The trial started on Monday 30 January 1989 at the [[Old Bailey]]. The judge was [[Brian Smedley]], Michael Worsley was the prosecuting barrister, and [[Geoffrey Robertson]] and Francis Irwin were the defence barristers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Bowcott | first= Owen | title= Artistic Merit Defence "Should Be Open to Foetus Earring Pair" | newspaper= The Guardian | pages= 2 | location= London | date= 31 January 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Mills | first= Heather | title= "Foetuses as Art" Case Hinges on Common Law | newspaper= The Independent | pages= 3 | location= London | date= 31 January 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Mills | first= Heather | title= Foetal Jury Told to Decide "Decency" | newspaper= The Independent | pages= 3 | location= London | date= 1 February 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Weeks | first= John | title= Foetus Earrings "An Outrage" | newspaper= Daily Telegraph | pages= 3 | location= London | date= 1 February 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 6 February 1989 the public nuisance charge was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Wolmar | first= Christian | authorlink= Christian Wolmar | title= Nusiance Charge in Foetus Case Dismissed | newspaper= The Independent | pages= 3 | location= London | date= 7 February 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A point of law was raised by the defence, which argued that "outraging public decency" was no longer known in law so long after the last occasion on which the charge had been preferred. The judge ruled that it could still be preferred no matter how long the hiatus, provided the facts fitted the offence.

On Tuesday 9 February 1989 the jury found Gibson and Sylveire guilty of outraging public decency.  Gibson was fined £500 and Sylveire was fined £300.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Mills | first= Heather | title= Artist and Curator Fined for Display of Foetus Earrings | newspaper= The Independent | pages= 3 | location= London | date= 10 February 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Lister | first= David | title= Gallery Has History of Artistic Controversy | newspaper= The Independent | pages= 3 | location= London | date= 10 February 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Bowcott | first= Owen | title= Foetus Artist Fined £500 for Sculpture | newspaper= The Guardian | pages= 3 | location= London | date= 10 February 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Weeks | first= John | title= Art Pair Fined Over Foetus Earrings | newspaper= The Daily Telegraph | pages= 3 | location= London | date= 10 February 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Foetus Earrings Outraged Decency | newspaper= The Times | pages= 3 | location= London | date= 10 February 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An appeal by the defence, on the point of the validity of the charge of outraging public decency, was dismissed by the [[Court of Appeal]], which upheld the trial judge's ruling and went some way to restating the law in this area.&lt;ref&gt;R v Gibson and Another. Court of Appeal, Criminal Division.[1991] 1 All ER 439, [1990] 2 QB 619, [1990] 3 WLR 595, [1990] Crim LR 738, 91 Cr App Rep 341, 155  JP 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Pawtoberfest was conceived as a promotional event by the [[Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region|HSPPR]] in an effort to encourage local [[pet adoption]]. The first Pawtoberfest in 2009 consisted of the K9-5K (then considered a separate event) on the streets of downtown [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], followed by a festival on the porch of the Nosh restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gazette.com/pooches-and-pals-celebrate-a-sunny-saturday/article/63973|title=Pooches and pals celebrate a sunny Saturday|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 and 2011, the event was held at [[America the Beautiful Park]]. Although typically an outdoor event, the festival portion of Pawtoberfest was held in the [[Norris-Penrose Event Center]] in 2012 due to weather complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csbj.com/2012/10/05/four-legged-friends-throw-a-costume-party-pawtoberfest-raises-money-for-humane-society/|title=Four-legged friends throw a costume party; Pawtoberfest raises money for Humane Society|date=2012-10-05|website=The Colorado Springs Business Journal|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent races have been hosted by [[Bear Creek Regional Park and Nature Center|Bear Creek Regional Park]]; however, the event center is still utilized for its parking lot. A dog-friendly shuttle service is offered to take participants to the start line, or directly to the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pawtoberfest.org/|title=Pawtoberfest|website=www.pawtoberfest.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sports Car Club of America]] created a "showroom stock" class for amateur club racing in 1972.&lt;ref name="WC History"&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Pro Racing World Challenge - history|url=http://www.world-challenge.com/series.php?page=history|work=SCCA Pro Racing World Challenge|publisher=[[Sports Car Club of America]]|accessdate=24 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410065423/http://www.world-challenge.com/series.php?page=history|archivedate=10 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, following the success of the [[Longest Day of Nelson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Longest Day of Nelson|url=http://www.nelsonledges.com/LONGESTDAY.aspx|publisher=[[Nelson Ledges Road Course]]|accessdate=24 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602094053/http://www.nelsonledges.com/LONGESTDAY.aspx|archivedate=2 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another 24-hour race at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course|Mid-Ohio]], the SCCA combined existing races into a manufacturer's championship. For 1985, the series became a 6-race professional championship with [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] from ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine. Escort [[radar detector]]s sponsored the series from 1986 until 1991.&lt;ref name="WC History"/&gt;
[[File:WCmmp.png|thumb|left|Fans invited to tour starting grid before 2011 season race]]
In 1990, the series was officially named World Challenge and was restructured to adopt rules similar to the European [[Group A]] for [[homologation|homologated]] production cars. The higher-cost "sports" classes were dropped after 1996, leaving the class format as it would stand until 2010. [[Speed (TV network)|Speed TV network]] began sponsoring the series in 1999. With fields growing, the series began separate races for the GT and Touring classes in 2000, which would remain until 2010. In 2010, the series moved away from the partnership with SPEED, and signed a broadcast partnership with Versus (now [[NBCSN]]) for coverage. The series moved existing touring cars into a new GTS class, while changing the rules for the touring car class to reduce costs and keep cars closer to stock.&lt;ref name="Car Facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Challenge Car Facts|url=http://www.world-challenge.com/series.php?page=carfacts|work=SCCA Pro Racing Speed World Challenge|publisher=[[Sports Car Club of America]]|accessdate=24 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724225437/http://www.world-challenge.com/series.php?page=carfacts|archivedate=24 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the SpeedVision television contract, the World Challenge eventually succeeded Trans Am as the SCCA's premier series.

In July 2008, the World Challenge series was purchased by WC Vision, a group of investors. The Sports Car Club of America remained the sanctioning partner of the series.

Starting with the 2011 season, the series signed a partnership with [[Pirelli]] and the leading tire manufacturer became the official tire supplier and title sponsor of the series.

In 2014, the Pirelli World Challenge established a GT-A classification similar to the FIA's bronze category.

In 2015, the series established GT Cup, featuring Porsche 991 Cup Cars that ran as part of the overall GT class races. Also, [[CBS Sports Network]] and [[Motor Trend|Motor Trend On Demand]] became the new television partners.

In 2016, the series established SprintX classes of racing featuring two-driver sprint races for several driver classes. As part of the partnership with the SRO, the GTS class was expanded to include GT4 homologations.

For 2017, the Pirelli World Challenge transferred to [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] as its sanctioning body. GT Cup class is expanding to include Cup cars from Lamborghini and Ferrari, while SprintX classes expand in both driver classification specificity and competition-legal platforms.

On May 25th, 2018, it was announced that the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation]] had become majority shareholder of WC Vision LLC, and thus majority owner of Pirelli World Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world-challenge.com/latest/series-news/sro-motorsports-group-becomes-majority-shareholder-in-wc-vision-llc/ |title=SRO Motorsports Group becomes majority shareholder in WC Vision LLC |work=Pirelli World Challenge|publisher=Pirelli World Challenge|accessdate=2018-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2018, it was announced the series acquired a new title sponsor as part of the overhaul of the Ratel series.  The GT Sprint Cup in Europe and GT Series Asia will now be known as the Blancpain GT World Challenge Europe and Asia, respectively.  The current World Challenge will become World Challenge America.

===Classes===

====GT/Grand Touring====
The allowed body styles within this class are coupe, sedan and convertible. The cars permitted in GT are typically sold in the market as “sports” cars, “sport-touring” cars, or performance versions of “luxury” cars. Forced induction is permitted on cars that come equipped with forced induction stock, or on cars that the series has determined need help reaching the target horsepower range. Power output ranges from 500&amp;nbsp;hp to 600&amp;nbsp;hp. Weight varies depending on power output and tire size. All of the vehicles in GT are rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive. FIA GT3 class cars are now approved to compete in the class starting in 2013.

====GTA====
A "GTA" ("GT Amateur") driver class that debuted in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-challenge.com/files/misc/wc_2014_gt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211104150/http://www.world-challenge.com/files/misc/wc_2014_gt.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a designation to recognize gentlemen drivers that compete in the GT class.

====GT Cup====
This spec class debuted in 2015 featuring Porsche 991 Cup Cars that are ran as part of the overall GT Class races, with a separate victory circle presentation alongside that of the GT/GT-A class winners. In 2017 the class is to be expanded to include Lamborghini Huracan Super Trofeo and Ferrari 488 Challenge cars.

====GTS/Grand Touring Sport====
The allowed body styles within this class are coupe, sedan and convertible. The cars permitted in GTS are typically marketed as “sports cars”, “sport-touring cars” or performance versions of “luxury” cars but at a lower permissible preparation level than GT. Forced induction is permitted on cars that come equipped with forced induction stock. Power output ranges from 300-400&amp;nbsp;hp. Weight varies depending on power output and tire size. Front-wheel, rear-wheel, and all-wheel drive configurations are permitted.  As of 2017, the class rules fully mimic the FIA GT4 formula.  Models include the [[Ford Mustang]], [[Chevrolet Camaro]], [[Acura TSX]], [[Audi TT]], [[Porsche Cayman]], [[Kia Optima]], [[Nissan 370Z]] and [[Scion FR-S]].

====Touring Car (TC)====
The allowed body styles in this class are coupes, hatchbacks, wagons, sedans. Power output ranges from approximately 300&amp;nbsp;hp. Weight varies depending on the power output of the individual drivetrain configurations. Front-wheel, rear-wheel, and all-wheel drive configurations are permitted. Forced induction may be allowed on cars that have forced induction systems available from the manufacturer which do not void the factory warranties.

====Touring Car A-Spec====

Established in 2014, this class is an evolution of the current TC class with an emphasis on maintaining cost effectiveness while providing an easy avenue to entry into professional racing. Performance modifications will be limited to mainly chassis tuning. Front wheel and rear wheel drive configurations are permitted. Target power output is 220 crank hp from non-modified stock engines. Forced induction maybe allowed on cars that have forced induction systems available from the manufacturer as a stock engine option. Examples of eligible cars include the [[Honda Civic SI]], [[Mazda MX-5]], [[Ford Focus]], [[Scion FR-S]] and [[Kia Forte]].

====Touring Car B-Spec====

These are smaller cars with small, efficient, naturally aspirated motors (target HP is 125). Modifications are limited to manufacturer specified performance spring and shocks to keep overall cost down. Cars competing in TCB are prepared to the SCCA Club Racing B Spec rules. Cars eligible include the [[Fiat 500]], [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Mazda 2]], [[Mini Cooper]], [[Chevrolet Sonic]], [[Honda Fit]], [[Kia Rio]], and [[Nissan Versa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-challenge.com/news/story.php?story=2325 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121070526/http://www.world-challenge.com/news/story.php?story=2325 |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The class was discontinued after the 2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://world-challenge.com/results/tc-class/pwc-adds-new-touring-car-division-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

===SprintX GT Championship Series===

On May 28, 2015 WC Vision announced an extended sprint format series in addition to its existing Sprint format racing series in [[2016 Pirelli World Challenge season|2016]], which was a standalone championship supporting the Pirelli World Challenge at all headliner events. For 2017, SprintX races continue to be 60 minutes in length and feature mandatory driver and tire changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motorsport.com/pwc/news/pirelli-world-challenge-to-add-extended-sprint-races-in-2016/|title=Pirelli World Challenge to add 'extended sprint' races in 2016|work=[[Motorsport.com]]|date=28 May 2015|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Older World Challenge cars==
Starting in 2009, older World Challenge cars became eligible (with minor modifications) for competition in [[SCCA]] racing. Under the SCCA's General Competition Rules (GCR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scca.com/clubracing/content.cfm?cid=44472 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027110646/http://www.scca.com/clubracing/content.cfm?cid=44472 |archivedate=2013-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Super Touring category allows World Challenge GTs to compete in STO and Touring cars to compete in STU. In 2013 the STO class was merged into the T1 and GT2 classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scca.com/clubracing/content.cfm?cid=44726 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208124023/http://www.scca.com/clubracing/content.cfm?cid=44726 |archivedate=2015-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==

[[File:SCCA World Challenge logo.jpg|thumb|left|TV logo]]

[[Speed (TV network)|Speed TV network]] televised the World Challenge starting in 1996, with the series being called the SPEED World Challenge until 2010.

Near the end of the broadcast partnership with SPEED, the World Challenge had been broadcast on weekdays as opposed to the traditional weekends. For 2009, the races were combined into an hour-long block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-challenge.com/news/story.php?ID=1187 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316050011/http://www.world-challenge.com/news/story.php?ID=1187 |archivedate=2009-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2010, Versus (now [[NBC Sports Network]]) announced they would televise 90-minute broadcasts beginning in the 2010 season.&lt;ref name="world-challenge.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-challenge.com/news/story.php?ID=1522 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716070635/http://www.world-challenge.com/news/story.php?ID=1522 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each broadcast featured all the races from each round. The entire 2010 season was shown on the channel. The series later returned to weekend telecasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-challenge.com/season.php?year=2010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125001324/http://www.world-challenge.com/season.php?year=2010 |archivedate=2010-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2015, [[CBS Sports Network]] announced that it acquired television rights to the series. [http://www.Torque.TV Torque.TV], later [https://www.motortrendondemand.com/ Motor Trend On Demand] partnered with CBS Sports Network for the race broadcasts to stream all races live on their website as well as on [http://world-challenge.com/streamvideo/ World-ChallengeTV.com]. CBS Sports Network will have at least 1 race with live television coverage with Detroit being the first round announced to have live coverage.

The series has also established a section on its official site where fans can watch archived race and in-car video, as well as an increasing amount of archived television broadcasts of events prior to the 2016 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://world-challenge.com/video/&lt;/ref&gt; The website currently has coverage from as far back as 2008.

==Tires==
On October 4, 2010, the series announced that [[Pirelli]] would replace longtime partner [[Toyo Tires]] as the exclusive tire supplier for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-challenge.com/news/story.php?story=1894 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005221033/http://www.world-challenge.com/news/story.php?story=1894 |archivedate=2010-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in series history, teams competed on [[racing slicks]] (Pirelli P Zero) rather than the DOT competition tires in use for much of its history. In January 2014, Pirelli Tire North America and WC Vision extended the partnership for an additional five years. The extension of the partnership between the tire brand and the top production car-based racing series will run through the 2018 season.

In the branch of linguistics known as [[pragmatics]], a '''presupposition''' (or '''PSP''') is an [[implicit assumption]] about the world or background belief relating to an utterance whose truth is taken for granted in [[discourse]]. Examples of presuppositions include:
* ''Jane no longer writes fiction.''
** Presupposition: Jane once wrote fiction.
* ''Have you stopped eating meat?''
** Presupposition: you had once eaten meat.
* ''Have you talked to Hans?''
** Presupposition: Hans exists.

A presupposition must be mutually known or assumed by the speaker and addressee for the utterance to be considered appropriate in context. It will generally remain a necessary assumption whether the utterance is placed in the form of an assertion, denial, or question, and can be associated with a specific lexical item or grammatical feature (presupposition trigger) in the utterance.

Crucially, [[negation]] of an expression does not change its presuppositions: ''I want to do it again'' and ''I don't want to do it again'' both presuppose that the subject has done it already one or more times; ''My wife is pregnant'' and ''My wife is not pregnant'' both presuppose that the subject has a wife. In this respect, presupposition is distinguished from [[entailment (pragmatics)|entailment]] and [[implicature]]. For example, ''The president was assassinated'' entails that ''The president is dead'', but if the expression is negated, the [[logical consequence|entailment]] is not [[logical truth|necessarily true]].

==Negation of a sentence containing a presupposition==
If presuppositions of a sentence are not consistent with the actual state of affairs, then one of two approaches can be taken. Given the sentences ''My wife is pregnant'' and ''My wife is not pregnant'' when one has no wife, then either:
# Both the sentence and its negation are false; or
# [[P. F. Strawson|Strawson's]] approach: Both "my wife is pregnant" and "my wife is not pregnant" use a wrong presupposition (i.e. that there exists a [[referent]] which can be described with the noun phrase ''my wife'') and therefore can not be assigned [[truth value]]s.

[[Bertrand Russell]] tries to solve this dilemma with two interpretations of the negated sentence:
# "There exists exactly one person, who is my wife and who is not pregnant"
# "There does not exist exactly one person, who is my wife and who is pregnant."

For the first phrase, Russell would claim that it is false, whereas the second would be true according to him.

==Projection of presuppositions==
A presupposition of a part of an utterance is sometimes also a presupposition of the whole utterance, and sometimes not. For instance, the phrase ''my wife'' triggers the presupposition that I have a wife. The first sentence below carries that presupposition, even though the phrase occurs inside an embedded clause. In the second sentence, however, it does not. John might be mistaken about his belief that I have a wife, or he might be deliberately trying to misinform his audience, and this has an effect on the meaning of the second sentence, but, perhaps surprisingly, not on the first one.
# John thinks that '''my wife''' is beautiful.
# John said that '''my wife''' is beautiful.
Thus, this seems to be a property of the main verbs of the sentences, ''think'' and ''say'', respectively. After work by [[Lauri Karttunen]],&lt;ref&gt;Karttunen, Lauri (1974) [http://www.stanford.edu/~laurik/publications/archive/presupplingcontext.pdf]. ''Theoretical Linguistics'' 1 181-94. Also in Pragmatics: A Reader, Steven Davis (ed.), pages 406-415, Oxford University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; verbs that allow presuppositions to "pass up" to the whole sentence ("project") are called '''holes''', and verbs that block such passing up, or ''projection'' of presuppositions are called '''plugs'''. Some linguistic environments are intermediate between plugs and holes: They block some presuppositions and allow others to project. These are called '''filters'''. An example of such an environment are [[indicative conditional]]s ("If-then" clauses). A conditional sentence contains an ''antecedent'' and a ''consequent''. The antecedent is the part preceded by the word "if," and the consequent is the part that is (or could be) preceded by "then." If the consequent contains a presupposition trigger, and the triggered presupposition is explicitly stated in the antecedent of the conditional, then the presupposition is blocked. Otherwise, it is allowed to project up to the entire conditional. Here is an example:
:If '''I have a wife''', then '''my wife''' is blonde.
Here, the presupposition triggered by the expression ''my wife'' (that I have a wife) is blocked, because it is stated in the antecedent of the conditional: That sentence doesn't imply that I have a wife. In the following example, it is not stated in the antecedent, so it is allowed to project, i.e. the sentence ''does'' imply that I have a wife.
:If it's already 4am, then '''my wife''' is probably angry.
Hence, conditional sentences act as ''filters'' for presuppositions that are triggered by expressions in their consequent.

A significant amount of current work in [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]] is devoted to a proper understanding of when and how presuppositions project.

==Presupposition triggers==
A presupposition trigger is a lexical item or linguistic construction which is responsible for the presupposition.&lt;ref&gt;Kadmon, Nirit. ''Formal pragmatics: semantics, pragmatics, presupposition, and focus''. Great Britain: Wiley-Blackwell, 2001, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a selection of presuppositional triggers following [[Stephen C. Levinson]]'s classic textbook on ''Pragmatics'', which in turn draws on a list produced by [[Lauri Karttunen]]. As is customary, the presuppositional triggers themselves are italicized, and the symbol » stands for 'presupposes'.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Stephen C. ''Pragmatics.''Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983, pp. 181-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definite descriptions===
{{main|Definite description}}

Definite descriptions are phrases of the form "the X" where X is a noun phrase. The description is said to be ''proper'' when the phrase applies to exactly one object, and conversely, it is said to be ''improper'' when either there exist more than one potential referents, as in "the senator from Ohio", or none at all, as in "the king of France". In conventional speech, definite descriptions are implicitly assumed to be proper, hence such phrases trigger the presupposition that the referent is unique and existent.
* John saw ''the man with two heads.'' &lt;br/&gt;»there exists a man with two heads.

===Factive verbs===
{{see also|Epistemology#Truth}}

In Western epistemology, there is a tradition originating with [[Plato]] of defining knowledge as justified true belief. On this definition, for someone to know X, it is required that X be true. A linguistic question thus arises regarding the usage of such phrases: does a person who states "John knows X" implicitly claim the truth of X? [[Steven Pinker]] explored this question in a [[popular science]] format in a 2007 book on language and cognition, using a widely publicized example from a speech by a U.S. president.&lt;ref name="Pinker2007pp6-9"&gt;{{Citation |last=Pinker |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Pinker |year=2007 |title=[[The Stuff of Thought|The stuff of thought: language as a window into human nature]] |publisher=Penguin Books |url= |doi= |isbn=978-0-670-06327-7 |ref=harv |postscript=, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jylSITT9ZNUC&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 6–9].}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 speech by George W. Bush included the line, "British Intelligence has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa."&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W., ''State of the Union Address'', January 28th, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, it became apparent that this intelligence lead was incorrect. But the way the speech was phrased, using a factive verb, implicitly framed the lead as truth rather than hypothesis. There is however a strong alternative view that ''factivity thesis'', the proposition that relational predicates having to do with knowledge, such as ''knows, learn, remembers,'' and ''realized'', presuppose the factual truth of their object, is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hazlett | first1 = A. | title = The Myth of Factive Verbs | journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 80 | pages = 497 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00338.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Martha ''regrets'' drinking John's home brew. 
** Presupposition: Martha did in fact drink John's home brew.
* Frankenstein was ''aware'' that Dracula was there. 
** Presupposition: Dracula was in fact there.
* John ''realized'' that he was in debt. 
** Presupposition: John was in fact in debt.
* It was ''odd'' how proud he was. 
** Presupposition: He was in fact proud.

Some further factive predicates: ''know; be sorry that; be proud that; be indifferent that; be glad that; be sad that.''

===Implicative verbs===
* John ''managed'' to open the door.&lt;br/&gt;»John tried to open the door.
* John ''forgot'' to lock the door.&lt;br/&gt;»John ought to have locked, or intended to lock, the door.

Some further implicative predicates: ''X happened to V''»X didn't plan or intend to ''V''; ''X avoided Ving''»X was expected to, or usually did, or ought to ''V'', etc.

===Change of state verbs===
* John ''stopped'' teasing his wife.&lt;br/&gt;»John had been teasing his wife.
* Joan ''began'' teasing her husband.&lt;br/&gt;»Joan hadn't been teasing her husband.

Some further change of state verbs: ''start; finish; carry on; cease; take'' (as in ''X took Y from Z'' » Y was at/in/with Z); ''leave; enter; come; go; arrive;'' etc.

===Iteratives===
* The flying saucer came ''again''.&lt;br/&gt;»The flying saucer came before.
* You can't get gobstoppers ''anymore''.&lt;br/&gt;»You once could get gobstoppers.
* Carter ''returned'' to power.&lt;br/&gt;»Carter held power before.

Further iteratives: ''another time; to come back; restore; repeat; for the nth time.''

===Temporal clauses===
* ''Before'' Strawson was even born, Frege noticed presuppositions.&lt;br/&gt;»Strawson was born.
* ''While'' Chomsky was revolutionizing linguistics, the rest of social science was asleep.&lt;br/&gt;»Chomsky was revolutionizing linguistics.
* ''Since'' Churchill died, we've lacked a leader.&lt;br/&gt;»Churchill died.

Further temporal clause constructors: ''after; during; whenever; as'' (as in ''As John was getting up, he slipped'').

===Cleft sentences===
* ''Cleft construction:'' It was Henry that kissed Rosie.&lt;br/&gt;»Someone kissed Rosie.
* ''Pseudo-cleft construction:'' What John lost was his wallet.&lt;br/&gt;»John lost something.

===Comparisons and contrasts===
Comparisons and contrasts may be marked by stress (or by other prosodic means), by particles like "too", or by comparatives constructions.
* Marianne called Adolph a male chauvinist, and then ''HE'' insulted ''HER''.&lt;br/&gt;»For Marianne to call Adolph a male chauvinist would be to insult him.
* Carol ''is a better linguist than'' Barbara.&lt;br/&gt;»Barbara is a linguist.

===Counterfactual conditionals===
* ''If'' the notice ''had'' only ''said'' 'mine-field' in Welsh as well as in English, we ''would'' never ''have lost'' poor Llewellyn.&lt;br/&gt;»The notice didn't say 'mine-field' in Welsh.

===Questions===
Questions often presuppose what the assertive part of the question presupposes, but interrogative parts might introduce further presuppositions. There are three different types of questions: yes/no questions, alternative questions and WH-questions.
* ''Is there'' a professor of linguistics at MIT?&lt;br/&gt;»Either there is a professor of linguistics at MIT or there isn't.
* ''Is'' Newcastle in England ''or'' in Australia?&lt;br/&gt;»Newcastle is in England or Newcastle is in Australia. 
* ''Who is'' the professor of linguistics at MIT?&lt;br/&gt;»Someone is the professor of linguistics at MIT.

===Possessive case===
* John'''s'' children are very noisy.&lt;br/&gt;»John has children.

==Accommodation of presuppositions==
A presupposition of a sentence must normally be part of the [[Grounding in communication|common ground]] of the utterance context (the shared knowledge of the [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]) in order for the sentence to be felicitous. Sometimes, however, sentences may carry presuppositions that are not part of the common ground and nevertheless be felicitous. For example, I can, upon being introduced to someone, [[out of the blue (idiom)|out of the blue]] explain that ''my wife is a dentist,'' this without my addressee having ever heard, or having any reason to believe that I have a wife. In order to be able to interpret my utterance, the addressee must assume that I have a wife. This process of an addressee assuming that a presupposition is true, even in the absence of explicit information that it is, is usually called '''presupposition accommodation'''. We have just seen that presupposition triggers like ''my wife'' ([[definite description]]s) allow for such accommodation. In "Presupposition and Anaphora: Remarks on the Formulation of the Projection Problem",&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul (2009) "Presupposition and Anaphora: Remarks on the Formulation of the Projection Problem," ''Linguistic Inquiry'', Vol. 40, No. 3, Pages 367-386. [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ling.2009.40.3.367]&lt;/ref&gt; the philosopher [[Saul Kripke]] noted that some presupposition triggers do not seem to permit such accommodation. An example of that is the presupposition trigger '''''too'''''. This word triggers the presupposition that, roughly, something parallel to what is stated has happened. For example, if pronounced with emphasis on ''John'', the following sentence triggers the presupposition that somebody other than John had dinner in New York last night.
: John had dinner in New York last night, too.
But that presupposition, as stated, is completely trivial, given what we know about New York. Several million people had dinner in New York last night, and that in itself doesn't satisfy the presupposition of the sentence. What is needed for the sentence to be felicitous is really that somebody relevant to the interlocutors had dinner in New York last night, and that this has been mentioned in the previous discourse, or that this information can be recovered from it. Presupposition triggers that disallow accommodation are called [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] presupposition triggers.

==Presupposition in critical discourse analysis==
[[Critical discourse analysis]] (CDA) seeks to identify presuppositions of an ideological nature. CDA is critical, not only in the sense of being analytical, but also in the ideological sense.&lt;ref name=vanDijk2003&gt;
"Critical discourse analysis (CDA) is a type of discourse analytical research that primarily studies the way social power abuse, dominance, and inequality are enacted, reproduced, and resisted by text and talk in the social and political context. With such dissident research, critical discourse analysts take explicit position, and thus want to understand, expose, and ultimately resist social inequality."&lt;br /&gt;
[[Teun A. van Dijk|Teun Adrianus van Dijk]], "[http://www.discourses.org/OldArticles/Critical%20discourse%20analysis.pdf Critical Discourse Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206042014/http://discourses.org/OldArticles/Critical%20discourse%20analysis.pdf |date=2009-02-06 }}", chapter 18 in Deborah Schiffrin, Deborah Tannen and Heidi E. Hamilton (eds.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QU-fx4NEu8cC The Handbook of Discourse Analysis]'', ([[Wiley-Blackwell]], 2003): pp. 352–371.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Teun A. van Dijk|Van Dijk]] (2003) says CDA "primarily studies the way social power abuse, dominance, and inequality" operate in [[speech act]]s (including written text)—"text and talk".&lt;ref name=vanDijk2003 /&gt; Van Dijk describes CDA as written from a particular point of view:&lt;ref name=vanDijk2003 /&gt; "dissendent research" aimed to "expose" and "resist social inequality."&lt;ref name=vanDijk2003 /&gt; One notable feature of ideological presuppositions researched in CDA is a concept termed [[synthetic personalisation]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

'''QuakeCon''' is a yearly convention held by [[ZeniMax Media]] to celebrate and promote the major franchises of [[id Software]] and other studios owned by ZeniMax. It includes a large, paid, bring-your-own-computer ([[BYOC]]) [[LAN party]] event with a competitive tournament held every year in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], USA. The event, which is named after [[id Software]]'s game ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', sees thousands of [[video game player|gamer]]s from all over the world attend every year to celebrate the company's gaming dynasty.

The event is highly dependent on volunteers to cover many aspects of the organization of the event. QuakeCon has historically had a reputation as the "[[Woodstock (music festival)|Woodstock]] of gaming", and a week of "peace, love, and rockets!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5946799/a-closer-look-at-the-woodstock-of-video-games|title=A Closer Look at the "Woodstock" of Video Games|author=Luke Plunkett|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.gameagent.com/peace-love-and-rockets-inside-quakecon-the-woodstock-of-gaming/|title=Peace, Love and Rockets: Inside QuakeCon|work=The GameAgent Blog|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
QuakeCon originally grew out of a group of people on the [[EFnet]] [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] network, in channel #quake.  As various regular visitors to the channel began expressing a desire to meet and game together in person, Jim Elson, a.k.a. "H2H", a gamer from the [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] area with ties to the local Dallas-area gaming community, and Yossarian Holmberg, a.k.a. "yossman", a computer consultant from [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Ontario]], Canada, came up with the idea of assembling at a hotel.
The original event name was actually '#quakecon', named after the IRC channel, though this quickly evolved into just 'QuakeCon'.  Mr. Elson organized the bulk of the event for the first two years, until the number of people attending each year demanded a more organized approach.  Volunteers grouped into teams to assist in the setup, troubleshooting, and tear down of the event's equipment and network.

=== 1996 ===
The first event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quakecon.org/about.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816025343/http://www.quakecon.org/about.html|title=QuakeCon 2000 - The World's Best Multiplayer Gaming Event|archivedate=16 August 2000|publisher=Quakecon.org|accessdate=20 December 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1996, was held at the [[Best Western]] hotel in [[Garland, Texas|Garland]], [[Texas]], a mile or two away from the [[id Software]] company offices.  Starting with just 30 people, by the end of the weekend the number of people had grown to 100, as news of the gathering began to spread on Internet chat networks.  The Best Western has since been replaced by a [[La Quinta Inn]].

Attendees who had brought their computers along to the event set up a small, impromptu network, in one of the hotel meeting rooms, playing mostly ''Quake I'' and ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', testing deathmatching skills. A small tournament was held, with winners taking home T-shirts as prizes.

The highlight of this first gathering came on the eve of the last day, when the entire [[id Software]] team showed up at the event in a surprise and most-welcome visit, stopping by to chat with the participants. [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]], lead programmer for ''Doom''/''Quake'', participated in a 30–45 min. group chat with attendees on the porch of the hotel.  Some ideas discussed during that chat eventually made it into Quake's future public releases. This "Carmack's Talk" grew into a yearly keynote speech that lasted through 2013.

=== 1997 ===
'''QuakeCon 1997''' brought an estimated 650 attendees to the [[Holiday Inn]] in [[Plano, Texas]]. It was covered by numerous Internet and broadcast media outlets, and was sponsored in part by id Software and Activision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://78.media.tumblr.com/4c24ab648e9cb5fccd4253ec4791f64b/tumblr_n5sc1uFRgX1s3xc9ao1_500.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998 ===
'''QuakeCon 1998''' was held in conjunction with the [[Cyberathlete Professional League]]. Due to poor planning and the lack of people who had helped make the first two events a success, QuakeCon 1998 is regarded by many as being only partially a QuakeCon event. However, it was instrumental in motivating a group of people to start planning QuakeCon 1999 early.

=== 1999 ===
'''QuakeCon 1999''' was the first event in which [[id Software]] played a major role in the organization. Recognizing that major sponsors were needed, David Miller a.k.a. "Wino" &amp; Paul Horoky a.k.a. "devilseye", both original QuakeCon 1996 people, contacted [[id Software]] and convinced them to become the main sponsor, and to help out with finding more sponsors. Together with Anna Kang (then [[id Software]] employee, now [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]]'s wife) and a team of volunteers, Mr. Miller &amp; Mr. Horoky set out to build QuakeCon 1999, which became the template for later years.

* Total Attendance: 1,100
* BYOC Size: 500
* Took Place: August 5–8&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quakecon.org/schedule.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991122015831/http://www.quakecon.org/schedule.html |title=QuakeCon 99|archivedate=November 22, 1999 |publisher=Quakecon.org|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Location: Mesquite Convention Center, [[Mesquite, Texas]], USA

* Total Attendance: 4,000+
* BYOC Size: 1,800
* Location: [[Hilton Anatole]], [[Dallas, Texas]], USA.
* Highlights: QuakeCon 2006 was the first time [[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars]] was playable by the general public. Longer than normal delays leading up to the official event announcement fueled Internet speculation that the event was actually canceled for the first time ever. It was also discussed publicly earlier in the year by id Software executives that the event had a possibility of not being held inside Texas, nearly breaking a 10-year tradition since the convention's start. The entire event was also announced, planned, and executed in little over a month, a much shorter timeline than prior years. The first QuakeCon to feature a Team Deathmatch tournament.
* The first event to include the Nvidia Quickdraw tournaments, which pulled random people from the BYOC area to compete for 1,000 dollars.
* Date took place: August 3–6, 2006.

* Total Attendance: 7,000+ (estimated)

* Highlights: Registration took place March 2, 2007 at 9:00pm EST.

There were just two featured tournaments, both with $50,000 purses, and both sponsored by NVIDIA: ET:QW, and the new Quad Damage Tournament, which combined all four Quake games into one competition. The event was also highlighted by a slew of major announcements, including [[id Software]]'s new intellectual property RAGE, a sneak peek at the "id Tech 5" engine, a 10-2-2007 release date for ET:QW, updates on the new [[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]] game title and major motion picture, the revelation that old id Software titles were to be made available via Steam, the upcoming debuts of Quake Arena Arcade, Quake Zero (now officially named Quake Live), and Quake Arena DS, also—in an unprecedented move—the announcement of the dates and venue for the next QuakeCon before the current year's event was even finished.

=== 2009 ===
'''QuakeCon 2009''' 
*Total Attendance: 7000+
*Location: [[Gaylord Texan Resort Hotel and Convention Center]], [[Grapevine, Texas]], USA.
*Date took place: August 13, 2009 - August 16, 2009
*Date announced: 12/18/08
*Highlights: Like the year before, Quakecon 2009 had both 1v1 and CTF tournaments for [[Quake Live]].  The notable difference with this year's tournaments was two separate 1v1 competitions, one for only pro players, and the other was open to everyone else.  This was a much appreciated feature from the community because there was no longer as many blow out games in the tournament.  djWHEAT (one of the commentators for this year's tournaments) also expressed his opinions to [[John Carmack]] from the shout casting booth saying that the separation "alleviates any hesitation or frustration" for amateur players that want a chance to compete.  Quakecon 2009 was also the first Quakecon to have the shoutcasters on stage during the grand finals.

==Reports of the massacre==

In June 2000, Egypt's [[Al-Wafd]] newspaper reported that a [[mass grave]] was discovered in Ras sedr, containing remains of 52 prisoners of war killed by Israeli forces during the war. The report said that some of the [[skull]]s had [[bullet]] holes in them, "which proves that the soldiers were executed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In April 2009, [[Haaretz]] reported that [[Israel]]i [[television director]] [[Ram Loevy]] had heard about the massacre shortly after the war, from fellow paratroopers in his unit. After testifying in [[Military Police Corps (Israel)#Criminal investigation|''Metzah'']], he was removed from the unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Rosiglitazone''' (trade name '''Avandia''') is an [[antidiabetic drug]] in the [[thiazolidinedione]] class. It works as an [[insulin]] sensitizer, by binding to the [[PPAR]] in fat cells and making the cells more responsive to insulin. It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a stand-alone drug or for use in combination with [[metformin]] or with [[glimepiride]]. First released in 1999, annual sales peaked at approximately $2.5-billion in 2006; however, following a [[meta-analysis]] published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] in 2007 that linked the drug's use to an increased risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]],&lt;ref name="pmid17517853"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nissen SE, Wolski K | title = Effect of rosiglitazone on the risk of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 356 | issue = 24 | pages = 2457–71 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17517853 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa072761 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sales plummeted to just $9.5-million in 2012. The drug's patent expired in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|US|5002953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
Rosiglitazone was approved by the US FDA in 1999 and by the EMEA in 2000;  the EMEA however required two postmarketing studies on longterm adverse effects, one for chronic heart failure and the other for cardiovascular effects.&lt;ref name="ema_recommend_suspend"/&gt;  The drug was approved for glycemic control in people with [[type 2 diabetes]], as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint, similar to that of other oral antidiabetic drugs.&lt;ref name="pmid17636824"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richter B, Bandeira-Echtler E, Bergerhoff K, Clar C, Ebrahim SH | title = Rosiglitazone for type 2 diabetes mellitus | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 3 | pages = CD006063 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17636824 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006063.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18955635"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Selvin E, Bolen S, Yeh HC, Wiley C, Wilson LM, Marinopoulos SS, Feldman L, Vassy J, Wilson R, Bass EB, Brancati FL | title = Cardiovascular outcomes in trials of oral diabetes medications: a systematic review | journal = Arch.

Published studies did not provide evidence that patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, costs and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by rosiglitazone.&lt;ref name=pmid17636824 /&gt;

== Adverse effects ==

===Heart failure===
One of the safety concerns identified before approval was fluid retention. Moreover, the combination of rosiglitazone with insulin resulted in a higher rate of congestive heart failure. In Europe there were contraindications for use in heart failure and combination with insulin.&lt;ref name="pmid21153629"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blind E, Dunder K, de Graeff PA, Abadie E |title=Rosiglitazone: a European regulatory perspective |journal=Diabetologia |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=213–8 |year=2011 |pmid=21153629 |doi=10.1007/s00125-010-1992-5 |url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/463/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00125-010-1992-5.pdf?auth66=1396284399_e9eda8c8a55934cf7cd09f8200c7c012&amp;ext=.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330004537/http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/463/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00125-010-1992-5.pdf?auth66=1396284399_e9eda8c8a55934cf7cd09f8200c7c012&amp;ext=.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta analysis of all trials from 2010 confirmed a higher risk of heart failure and a double risk when rosiglitazone was administered as add-on therapy to insulin.&lt;ref name="pmid19328563"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mannucci E, Monami M, Di Bari M, Lamanna C, Gori F, Gensini GF, Marchionni N | title = Cardiac safety profile of rosiglitazone: a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials | journal = Int.

===Heart attacks===
The relative risk of ischemic cardiac events seen in pre-approval trials of rosiglitazone was similar to that of comparable drugs, but there was increased LDL cholesterol, LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nissen|first=Steven|title=Rosiglitazone a critical overview.

In 2005, at the insistence of the World Health Organization, GSK performed a meta-analysis of all 37 trials involving use of rosiglitazone, finding a hazard ratio of 1.29 (0.99 to 1.89). 
In 2006 the GSK updated the analysis, now including 42 trials and showing a hazard ratio of 1.31 (1.01 to 1.70). A large observational study comparing patients treated with rosiglitizone with patients treated with other diabetes therapies was performed at the same time and found a relative risk of 0.93 (95% C.I. 0.8 to 1.1) for those treated with rosiglitazone.  The information was passed to the FDA and posted on the company website, but not otherwise published. GSK provided these analyses to the FDA, but neither the company nor the FDA warned prescribers or patients of the hazard.&lt;ref name="Nissen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nissen|first=Steven|title=Rosiglitazone: a case of regulatory  hubris|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f7428|publisher=BMJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FDA, the Agency did not issue a safety bulletin because the results of the meta analysis conflicted with those of the observational study and with the results of the ADOPT trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Testimony/ucm153838.htm |title=Safety of Rosiglitazone Maleate (Avandia) |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[meta-analysis]] in May 2007 reported the use of rosiglitazone was associated with a 1.4 fold increased risk of [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and a numerically higher (but non-significant) increase in risk of death from all cardiovascular diseases against control. It contained 42 trials of which 27 were unpublished.&lt;ref name="pmid17517853" /&gt; Another meta analysis of 4 trials with follow-up longer than 1 year found similar results.&lt;ref name="Singh 1189–95"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|author2=Loke, YK |author3=Furberg, CD |title=Long-term risk of cardiovascular events with rosiglitazone: a meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Sep 12, 2007|volume=298|issue=10|pages=1189–95|pmid=17848653|doi=10.1001/jama.298.10.1189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nissen's meta analysis was criticized in a 2007 article by George Diamond ''et al'' in the [[Annals of Internal Medicine]].  The authors concluded that Nissens' analysis had excluded trials with important data on the cardiovascular profile of rosiglitazone, had inappropriately combined trials of greatly differing design, and had inappropriately excluded trials with no cardiovascular events. The authors concluded that no firm conclusion could be drawn regarding whether rosiglitazone increased or decreased cardiovascular risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Diamond GA, Bax L, Kaul S |title=Uncertain effects of rosiglitazone on the risk for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death |journal=Ann.

Noting the recent publication by Nissen, they repeated their meta analysis including only the trials included in the Nissen study that dealt with Type II diabetics. (The Nissen study included some trials in people with other disorders.) They did not find a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular events, but noted that all of the cardiovascular endpoints they analyzed showed a non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the rosiglitazone arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richter B, Bandeira-Echtler E, Bergerhoff K, Clar C, Ebrahim SH |title=Rosiglitazone for type 2 diabetes mellitus |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD006063 |year=2007 |pmid=17636824 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006063.pub2 |url=http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/20292/1/20292.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007 the FDA held a joint meeting of the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.  FDA scientist Joy Mele presented a meta analysis examining the cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone in completed clinical trials.  The study found an overall 1.4x increase in risk of cardiovascular ischemic events relative to the control arms. The results were heterogenous, with clear evidence of increased risk relative to placebo but not relative to other diabetes treatments and higher risk associated with combinations of rosiglitazone with insulin or metformin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/slides/2007-4308s1-00-index.htm |title=Dockets: |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the 1.4x increased risk relative to control groups, FDA scientist David Graham presented an analysis suggesting that rosiglitazone had caused 83,000 excess heart attacks between 1999 and 2007.&lt;ref name=Senatereport&gt;[http://www.finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/download/?id=9e4b091f-de21-4df1-b65e-b227d74bec12 "Staff report on GlaxoSmithKline and the diabetes drug Avandia"], Committee on Finance, United States Senate, January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;[[David Graham (epidemiologist)|David Graham]], [http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/slides/2007-4308s1-08-fda-graham_files/frame.htm "Assessment of the cardiovascular risks and health benefits of rosiglitazone"], Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, Food and Drug Administration, 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The advisory panel voted 20 : 3 that the evidence available indicated that rosiglitazone increased the risk of cardiovascular events and 22 : 1 that the overall risk:benefit ratio of rosiglitazone justified its continued marketing in the United States. The FDA placed restrictions on the drug, including adding a [[boxed warning]] about heart attacks, but did not withdraw it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109026.htm "FDA Adds Boxed Warning for Heart-related Risks to Anti-Diabetes Drug Avandia. Agency says drug to remain on market, while safety assessment continues"], Food and Drug Administration, 14 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 a study to address the concerns regarding cardiovascular safety was requested by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA). GSK agreed to perform post-marketing a long-term cardiovascular morbidity/mortality study in patients on rosiglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea or metformin: the RECORD study. The results as published in 2009 showed that rosiglitazone was non-inferior to treatment with metformin or a suflonylurea with respect to the rate of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. European regulators concluded that due in part to design limitations, the results neither proved nor eliminated concerns of excess cardiovascular risk.&lt;ref name=pmid21153629 /&gt;

In February 2010, the FDA's associate director of drug safety, recommended rosiglitazone be taken off the market. In June 2010, they published a retrospective study comparing roziglitazone to pioglitazone, the other thiazolidinedione marketed in the United States and concluded rosiglitazone was associated with "an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality and an increased risk of the composite of AMI, stroke, heart failure, or all-cause mortality in patients 65 years or older".&lt;ref name="pmid20584880"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graham DJ, Ouellet-Hellstrom R, MaCurdy TE, Ali F, Sholley C, Worrall C, Kelman JA | title = Risk of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and death in elderly Medicare patients treated with rosiglitazone or pioglitazone | journal = JAMA | volume = 304 | issue = 4 | pages = 411–8 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20584880 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[number needed to harm]] with roziglitazone was sixty. Graham argued rosiglitazone caused 500 more heart attacks and 300 more heart failures than its main competitor.

Two meta analyses released in 2010, one incorporating 56 trials and a second incorporating 164 trials reached conflicting conclusions.

A meta-analysis of 16 observational studies released in March, 2011, compared rosiglitazone to pioglitazone, finding support for greater cardiovascular safety for pioglitazone. The meta-analysis involved 810 000 patients taking rosiglitazone or [[pioglitazone]]. The study suggests 170 excess myocardial infarctions, 649 excess cases of heart failure, and 431 excess deaths for every 100 000 patients who receive rosiglitazone rather than pioglitazone.&lt;ref name="pmid21415101"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loke YK, Kwok CS, Singh S | title = Comparative cardiovascular effects of thiazolidinediones: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies | journal = BMJ | volume = 342 | issue = | pages = d1309 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21415101 | pmc = 3230110 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d1309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Hughes S | title = More damning data on rosiglitazone | url = http://www.theheart.org/article/1199863.do | publisher = theheart.org | accessdate = 6 April 2011 | date = 27 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by another meta-analysis involving 945 286 patients in 8 retrospective cohort studies, most in the US.&lt;ref name=Chen2012/&gt;

A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs, involving 13,715 patients and including both rosiglitazone- and pioglitazone-treated patients, showed an overall 45% increased risk of fracture with thiazolidone use compared with placebo or active comparator. It doubled the risk of fractures among women with type 2 diabetes, without a significant increase in risk of fractures among men with type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref name="Loke metaanalysis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loke|first=Y.

===Hypoglycaemia===
The risk of hypoglycaemia is reduced with [[thiazolidinedione]]s when compared with [[sulfonylureas]]; the risk is similar to the risk with metformin (high strength of evidence).&lt;ref name="drug class review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jonas|first=Dan|title=Drug Class Review: Newer Diabetes Medications, TZDs, and Combinations Final Original Report  Drug Class Reviews|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0009777/|publisher=Oregon Health &amp; Science University;|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[thiazolidinedione]]s cause a similar degree of weight gain to that caused by sulfonylureas (moderate strength of evidence).&lt;ref name="drug class review" /&gt;

===Eye damage===
Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have been suspected of causing [[macular edema]], which damages the retina of the eye and causes partial blindness. Blindness is also a possible effect of diabetes, which rosiglitazone is intended to treat.

===Contraindications===
Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are contraindicated in people with [[NYHA classification|NYHA Class]] III and IV heart failure. They are not recommended for use inheart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=rosiglitazone|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=ef14122b-7fff-45fa-b13b-0ea9e48bd57d|publisher=DailyMed The National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe rosiglitazone was contraindicated for heart failure or history of heart failure with regard to all NYHA stages, for combined use with insulin and for acute coronary syndrome.&lt;ref name=pmid21153629 /&gt; The European Medicines Agency recommended on 23 September 2010 that Avandia be suspended from the European market.&lt;ref name="ema_recommend_suspend"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_ema_suspension"/&gt;

==Pharmacology==
[[File:Avandia 2mg oral tablet.jpg|thumb|Two Avandia 2 mg oral tablets]]
Rosiglitazone is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. Thiazolidinediones act as insulin sensitizers. They reduce glucose, fatty acid, and insulin blood concentrations. They work by binding to the [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]]s (PPARs). PPARs are transcription factors that reside in the nucleus and become activated by ligands such as thiazolidinediones. Thiazolidinediones enter the cell, bind to the nuclear receptors, and alter the expression of genes. The several PPARs include PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ. Thiazolidinediones bind to [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma|PPARγ]].

PPARs are expressed in fat cells, cells of the liver, muscle, heart, and inner wall (endothelium) and smooth muscle of blood vessels. PPARγ is expressed mainly in fat tissue, where it regulates genes involved in fat cell (adipocyte) differentiation, fatty acid uptake and storage, and glucose uptake. It is also found in pancreatic beta cells, vascular endothelium, and macrophages&lt;ref name="pmid15356308"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yki-Järvinen H | title = Thiazolidinediones | journal = N.

Other drugs bind to PPARα.

Rosiglitazone also appears to have an anti-[[inflammation|inflammatory]] effect in addition to its effect on [[insulin resistance]]. Nuclear factor kappa-B ([[NF-κB]]), a signaling molecule, stimulates the inflammatory pathways. NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) downregulates the inflammatory pathways. When patients take rosiglitazone, NF-κB levels fall and IκB levels increase.&lt;ref name="pmid15181049"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohanty P, Aljada A, Ghanim H, Hofmeyer D, Tripathy D, Syed T, Al-Haddad W, Dhindsa S, Dandona P | title = Evidence for a potent antiinflammatory effect of rosiglitazone | journal = J.

In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department announced GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for withholding the results of two studies of the cardiovascular safety of Avandia between 2001 and 2007. The settlement stems from claims made by four employees of GlaxoSmithKline, including a former senior marketing development manager for the company and a regional vice president, who tipped off the government about a range of improper practices from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

====United States investigations====

GlaxoSmithKline was being investigated by the FDA and the US Congress regarding Avandia.

Senators Democrat [[Max Baucus]] and Republican [[Charles Grassley]] filed a report urging GSK to withdraw Avandia in 2008 due to the side effects. The report noted the drug caused 500 avoidable heart attacks a month, and Glaxo officials sought to intimidate doctors who criticized the drug. It also said GSK continued to sell and promote the drug despite knowing the increased risk of heart attacks and stroke.&lt;ref name="urlInteractive: Timeline: The story of Avandia | Need to Know | PBS"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/health/timeline-history-of-avandia/2314/ | title = Interactive: Timeline: The story of Avandia &amp;#124; Need to Know | publisher = PBS | format = | work = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Senate Finance Committee]], in a panel investigation, revealed emails from GSK company officials that suggest the company downplayed scientific findings about safety risks dating back to 2000. It was also alleged by the committee that the company initiated a "ghostwriting campaign", whereby GSK sought outside companies to write positive articles about Avandia to submit to medical journals.&lt;ref name="urlAvandias Fate May be Sealed Today"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/heavy-doses/2010/07/14/medical-experts-vote-on-whether-to-pull-avandia-from-market#ixzz0tgGHXXRG | title = Avandia's Fate May be Sealed Today | format = | work = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; GSK defended itself by presenting data that its own tests found Avandia to be safe, although an FDA staff report showed the conclusions were flawed.&lt;ref name="urlAvandia Safety Questioned Again"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/heavy-doses/2010/07/09/avandia-safety-questioned-again-before-a-government-panel-review | title = Avandia Safety Questioned Again | format = | work = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2010, after two days of extensive deliberations, the FDA panel investigating Avandia came to a mixed vote. Twelve members of the panel voted to take the drug off the market, 17 recommended to leave it on but with a more revised warning label, and three voted to keep it on the market with the current warning label.&lt;ref name="url12 panel members recommend Avandia withdrawal - FiercePharma"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/breaking-news-12-panel-members-recommend-avandia-withdrawal/2010-07-14 | title = 12 panel members recommend Avandia withdrawal | publisher = FiercePharma | format = | work = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlWhat is the meaning of the Avandia vote? - FiercePharma"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/what-does-avandia-vote-mean/2010-07-14 | title = What is the meaning of the Avandia vote? | publisher = FiercePharma | format = | work = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel has come to some controversy, however; on July 20, 2010, one of the panelists was discovered to have been a paid speaker for GlaxoSmithKline, arousing questions of a conflict of interest. This panel member was one of the three who voted to keep Avandia on the market with no additional warning labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704720004575377552600421936 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Panelist Who Backed Avandia Gets Fees From Glaxo | author = Mundy A | date=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://triangle.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2010/07/19/daily18.html | first=James | last=Gallagher | title=Report: Avandia panelist paid by GSK | date=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the FDA has decided on revising its prescribing information and medication guides for all rosilitazone containing medicines. The US label for rosiglitazone ([[Avandia]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) and all rosiglitazone-containing medications ([[Avandamet]] and [[Avandaryl]]) now include the additional safety information and restrictions.&lt;ref name="pmid22232110"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ross JS, Jackevicius C, Krumholz HM, Ridgeway J, Montori VM, Alexander GC, Zerzan J, Fan J, Shah ND | title = State Medicaid programs did not make use of prior authorization to promote safer prescribing after rosiglitazone warning | journal = Health Aff (Millwood) | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 188–98 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22232110 | pmc = 3319744 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2011.1068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = O'Riordan M | title = New rosiglitazone label includes restrictions on use | url = http://www.theheart.org/article/1182011.do | publisher = theheart.org | accessdate = 1 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised labels restrict use to patients already taking a rosiglitazone-containing medicine or to new patients who are unable to achieve adequate glycemic control on other diabetes medications and to those, who in consultation with their healthcare provider, have decided not to take Actos ([[pioglitazone]]) or other pioglitazone-containing medicines for medical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GSK revises US Avandia label to include new restrictions on use |url=http://www.gsk.com/media/pressreleases/2011/2011_pressrelease_10024.htm |publisher=GlaxoSmithKline |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217063445/http://www.gsk.com/media/pressreleases/2011/2011_pressrelease_10024.htm |archivedate=17 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013 an FDA Advisory Committee reviewed all available data, including a re-adjudicated RECORD trial, found no evidence of increased cardiovascular risk with Avandia, and voted to remove the restrictions on Avandia marketing in the United States.  In November 2013, the US FDA removed these marketing restrictions on the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rosiglitazone-containing Diabetes Medicines: Drug Safety Communication – Removal of Some Prescribing and Dispensing Restrictions | url = http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm376683.htm?source=govdelivery | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the FDA’s instruction, Avandia’s maker, GlaxoSmithKline, had funded the Duke Clinical Research Institute to re-analyze the raw data from the study. At the 2010 panel, three panelists voted that the existing warnings were good enough; two were back in 2013. Seven voted to make those warnings more onerous, and five of them returned. But of the 10 who voted to restrict Avandia’s use, only four returned. And of the 12 who voted in 2010 to withdraw Avandia from the market, only three came back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herper|first=Matthew|title=Avandia Vote Ends An Era Of Drug Safety Scandals|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/06/06/what-the-fdas-avandia-decision-means-for-the-future/|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=Forbes|date=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European investigations====
In 2000 a  study to address the concerns regarding cardiovascular safety was requested by the EMA, and the makers agreed to perform post-marketing a long-term cardiovascular morbidity/mortality study in patients on rosiglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea or metformin: the RECORD study. The results as published in 2009 showed non-inferiority with regard to cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death when the treatment with rosiglitazone was compared with metformin or a sulfonylurea. For myocardial infarction, there was a non-statistically significant increase in risk. In their assessment, the European regulators acknowledged weaknesses of the study, such as an unexpectedly low rate of cardiovascular events and the open-label design, which may lead to reporting bias. They found that the results were inconclusive.&lt;ref name=pmid21153629 /&gt; The European Medicines Agency recommended on 23 September 2010 that Avandia be suspended from the European market.&lt;ref name="ema_recommend_suspend"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_ema_suspension"/&gt;

According to a probe by the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in September 2010, the United Kingdom's Commission on Human Medicines recommended to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) back in July 2010, to withdraw Avandia sale because its "risks outweigh its benefits". Additionally, the probe revealed that in 2000, members of the European panel in charge of reviewing Avandia prior to its approval had concerns about the long-term risks of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703713504575475884140520538?mod=googlenews_wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=U.K. Medical Journal Questions Avandia License | first=Jason | last=Douglas | date=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlU.K. watchdogs vote for Avandia withdrawal – FiercePharma"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/u-k-watchdogs-vote-avandia-withdrawal/2010-09-07 | title = U.K. watchdogs vote for Avandia withdrawal | publisher = FiercePharma | format = | work = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand ====
Rosiglitazone was withdrawn from the New Zealand market April 2011 because [[Medsafe]] concluded the suspected cardiovascular risks of the medicine for patients with type 2 diabetes outweigh its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10706910 | title = Diabetes drug to be withdrawn over heart risk fears | date = Feb 17, 2011 | publisher = New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Africa====
A notice issued by the Medicines Control Council of South Africa on July 5, 2011 stated that it had resolved on July 3, 2011 to withdraw all rosiglitazone-containing medicines from the South African market due to safety risks. It disallowed all new prescriptions of Avandia.&lt;ref name=MCC&gt;{{cite web|last=Medicines Control Council |title=Withdrawal of rosiglitazone-containing medicines from SA market |url=http://www.doh.gov.za/show.php?id=2788 |publisher=Department of Health, Republic of South Africa |accessdate=25 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105104135/http://doh.gov.za/show.php?id=2788 |archivedate=5 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy and response===
Following the reports in 2007 that Avandia can significantly increase the risk of heart attacks, the drug has been controversial. A 2010 article in ''Time'' uses the Avandia case as evidence of a broken FDA regulatory system that "may prove criminal as well as fatal". It details the disclosure failures, adding, "Congressional reports revealed that GSK sat on early evidence of the heart risks of its drug, and that the FDA knew of the dangers months before it informed the public." It reports, "the FDA is investigating whether GSK broke the law by failing to fully inform the agency of Avandia's heart risks", according to deputy FDA commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein. GSK threatened academics who reported adverse research results, and received multiple warning letters from the FDA for deceptive marketing and failure to report clinical data.&lt;ref name="urlTIME"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2010028,00.html | title = After Avandia: Does the FDA Have a Drug Problem? | date = Aug 12, 2010 | work = Time| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maker of the drug, GlaxoSmithKline, has dealt with serious backlash against the company for the drug's controversy.&lt;ref name="urlWill Avandia Be Yanked Off the Market? - US News"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://health.usnews.com/health-news/managing-your-healthcare/diabetes/articles/2010/07/09/will-avandia-be-yanked-off-the-market.html | title = Will Avandia Be Yanked Off the Market? | publisher = US News | work = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales on the drug dropped significantly after the story first broke in 2007, dropping from $2.5 billion in 2006 to less than $408 million in 2009 in the US.&lt;ref name="urlExclusive: Takeda launches Actos DTC campaign today – Medical Marketing and Media"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mmm-online.com/exclusive-takeda-launches-actos-dtc-campaign-today/article/174652/ | title = Exclusive: Takeda launches Actos DTC campaign today | publisher = Medical Marketing and Media | format = | work = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three doctors' groups, the [[Endocrine Society]], the [[American Diabetes Association]] and the [[American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists]], urged patients to continue to take the drug as it would be much worse to stop all treatment, despite any associated risk, but that patients could consult their doctors and begin a switch to a different drug if they or their doctors find concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1521260120100715 | work=Reuters | title=Don't dump Avandia, diabetes groups urge patients | date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/15/news/la-heb-avandia-20100715 | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Patients taking Avandia should keep on doing so, doctor groups say | first=Thomas H. | last=Maugh II | date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20010767-10391704.html | work=CBS News | title=Avandia News: What You Need to Know | first=Neil | last=Katz | date=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Heart Association]] said in a statement in June 2010: " ...the reports deserves serious consideration, and patients with diabetes who are 65 years of age or older and being treated with rosiglitazone should discuss the findings with their prescribing physician....".

Rosiglitazone was thought to be able to benefit patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]] who do not express the [[Apolipoprotein E|ApoE4]] [[allele]],&lt;ref name="pmid16446752"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Risner ME, Saunders AM, Altman JF, Ormandy GC, Craft S, Foley IM, Zvartau-Hind ME, Hosford DA, Roses AD | title = Efficacy of rosiglitazone in a genetically defined population with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease | journal = Pharmacogenomics J. | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 246–54 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16446752 | doi = 10.1038/sj.tpj.6500369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the phase III trial designed to test this showed that rosiglitazone was ineffective in all patients, including [[Apolipoprotein E|ApoE4]]-negative patients.&lt;ref name="pmid20733306"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gold M, Alderton C, Zvartau-Hind M, Egginton S, Saunders AM, Irizarry M, Craft S, Landreth G, Linnamägi U, Sawchak S | title = Rosiglitazone monotherapy in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease: results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study | journal = Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–46 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20733306 | pmc = 3214882 | doi = 10.1159/000318845 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosiglitazone may also treat mild to moderate [[ulcerative colitis]], due to its anti-inflammatory properties as a PPAR ligand.&lt;ref name="pmid18471502"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lewis JD | title = Will 2008 mark the start of a new clinical trial era in gastroenterology? | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 134 | issue = 5 | pages = 1289 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18471502 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.03.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is also over a decade old, dating back to at least 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/skappleton MySpace.com - Skappleton 2008 - APPLETON, Wisconsin - Ska / Reggae / Punk - www.myspace.com/skappleton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is organized by the bands Something to Do and Car Full of Midgets.

SKAppleton 2011 took place on June 5th at Tanner's in Kimberly, Wisconsin, and featured Something To Do, [[Car Full of Midgets]], [[Shortstop From Tokyo]], [[Crazy 88]],  [[Superluck]] and more. [[Mustard Plug]] headlined the festival. 

This also proved to be [[Car Full of Midgets]] last Skappleton, and their second to last show. They played their farewell show a few months later at [[Paperfest]] in Kimberly. 

In 2012, due to financial issues, Skappleton was moved to [[Milwaukee]] after 19 years in Appleton and was sponsored by [[Horny Goat.]]

'''SkyFire''' is a planned [[nanosatellite]] spacecraft that will fly by the [[Moon]] and collect surface [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopy]] and [[Infrared spectroscopy|thermography]]. It is scheduled to fly on the [[Space Launch System]], [[Exploration Mission 1]] (EM-1) scheduled to launch in 2020.

==Mission==
Its purpose is that of a [[Geosynchronous Earth Orbit]] (GEO) technology demonstration using a low-cost 6U [[CubeSat]] spacecraft. SkyFire will perform a lunar flyby, collecting spectroscopy and thermography for surface characterization, remote sensing, and site selection.&lt;ref name="Williams2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/20150408-NAC-Crusan-EMC-v7a_TAGGED.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pioneering Space –the Evolvable Mars Campaign |last=Williams |first=Greg |last2=Crusan |first2=Jason |work=NASA |date=April 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft includes two deployable [[solar array]]s and will have a total mass of about {{convert|14|kg|abbr=on}}.

SkyFire was selected in April 2015 by NASA's NextSTEP program (Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships) and awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin Space systems worth $1.4 million for further development.&lt;ref name="Morring2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Morring |first=Frank |url=http://aviationweek.com/Habitats |title=Habitats Could Be NASA's Next Commercial Spacecraft Buy |work=Aviation Week |date=24 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SClark"&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Stephen |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/08/nasa-adding-to-list-of-cubesats-flying-on-first-sls-mission/ |title=NASA adding to list of CubeSats flying on first SLS mission |work=Spaceflight Now |date=8 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gunter SkyFire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/skyfire.htm |title=Skyfire |last=Krebs |first=Gunter Dirk |work=Gunter's Space Page |date=19 May 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
SkyFire will fly along other 12 [[CubeSat]]s as a secondary payload mission on the first flight of the [[Space Launch System]], [[Exploration Mission 1]] (EM-1) scheduled to launch in 2020.&lt;ref name=2019-slip/&gt;

==Propulsion==
SkyFire will also demonstrate a low thrust electric propulsion rocket engine technology called [[Colloid thruster|electrospray propulsion]] to lower the spacecraft's orbit for additional science and technology mission objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/next-space-technologies-for-exploration-partnerships-nextstep-projects |title=Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) Projects |work=NASA |publisher=NASA |date=May 5, 2015 |accessdate=2016-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2568">'''The Unnatural and Accidental Women''' is a play by Metis playwright [[Marie Clements]] about the disappearance of multiple Indigenous women&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.ubc.ca/fnis401fwikler/2016/12/15/a-flip-through-of-the-unnatural-and-accidental-women-a-play-by-marie-clements/|title=The Unnatural and Accidental Women|last=Wikler|first=Alexandra|date=|website=Blogs UBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Downtown Eastside|Downtown Eastside of Vancouver]] whose deaths of extremely high blood-alcohol levels were all caused by one man, [[Gilbert Paul Jordan]].

In an attempt to reclaim the lives and importance of the victims, which was largely ignored by press coverage of the Jordan case, Clements' play is a surrealist exploration that jumps around in time to show the women in the final days before their deaths.

{{Nuclear program of Iran}}
This is the '''[[Chronology|timeline]] of the [[nuclear program of Iran]]'''.

==1956–1979==
1957: The [[United States]] and [[Iran]] sign a civil nuclear co-operation agreement as part of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Atoms for Peace]] program.&lt;ref name="org1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/oxford_research_group_chronology_irans_nuclear_programme_1957_2007|title=Chronology of Iran's Nuclear Program|accessdate = 2006-09-25|publisher=Oxford Research Group|year=2006| first = Dr. Farhang | last = Jahanpour }}&lt;/ref&gt;

August 9, 1963: Iran signs the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Partial nuclear test ban treaty]] (PTBT) and ratifies it on December 23, 1963.&lt;ref name="iaea2003"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/cnpp2003/CNPP_Webpage/countryprofiles/Iran/Iran2003.htm|title=ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN|accessdate = 2006-09-21|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agenct|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1967: The Tehran Nuclear Research Centre is built and run by the [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]] (AEOI).

September 1967: The United States supplies 5.545&amp;nbsp;kg of enriched [[uranium]], of which 5.165 [[kg]] contain [[fissile]] [[isotope]]s for [[fuel]] in a research reactor. The United States also supplies 112 g of [[plutonium]], of which 104 g are fissile isotopes, for use as start-up sources for research reactor.&lt;ref name="org1" /&gt;

July 1968: Iran signs the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and ratifies it. It goes into effect on March 5, 1970.

1970s: Under the rule of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]], plans are made to construct up to 20 [[nuclear power]] stations across the country with U.S. support and backing. Numerous contracts are signed with various Western firms, and the [[Germany|German]] firm [[Kraftwerk Union]] (a subsidiary of [[Siemens AG]]) begins construction on the [[Bushehr]] power plant in 1974.

1974: the '''Atomic Energy Act of Iran''' was promulgated. The Act covers the activities for which the [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]] was established at that period. These activities included using atomic energy and radiation in industry, [[agriculture]] and service industries, setting up atomic power stations and desalination factories, producing source materials needed in atomic industries. This creates the scientific and technical infrastructure required for carrying out the said projects, as well as co-ordinating and supervising all matters pertaining to atomic energy in the country.&lt;ref name="iaea2003iran"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/cnpp2004/CNPP_Webpage/countryprofiles/Iran/Iran2003.htm|title=Islamic Republic of Iran|accessdate=2006-05-28|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1974: The Shah lent $1 billion to the French Atomic Energy Commission to help build the [[Eurodif]] uranium processing company in Europe.  In exchange, Iran received rights to 10% of the enriched uranium product, a right Iran never exercised.  After a bitter legal dispute, the loan was repaid in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Meier.

Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. Retrieved 26 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

1975: [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] signs a contract with the [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]] to provide training for Iranian nuclear engineers.

1975: Iran buys a 15% interest in the [[Rössing uranium mine]] of [[Namibia]].  However, due to international pressure, it is never allowed to collect any uranium from this outside country.

==1979–1996==

1979: Iran's [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]] puts a freeze on the existing nuclear program and the [[Bushehr]] contract with [[Siemens AG]] is terminated as the German firm leaves.

1982: Iranian officials announced that they planned to build a reactor powered by their own uranium at the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre.

1983: International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors inspect Iranian nuclear facilities, and report on a proposed co-operation agreement to help Iran manufacture enriched uranium fuel as part of Iran's "ambitious program in the field of nuclear power reactor technology and fuel cycle technology." The assistance program is later terminated under U.S. pressure.

1984: Iranian radio announced that negotiations with [[Niger]] on the purchase of uranium were nearing conclusion.

1985: Iranian radio programs openly discuss the significance of the discovery of uranium deposits in Iran with the director of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation. also in this year Iran, [[Syria]] and [[Libya]] say that they should all develop nuclear weapons to counter the [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israeli nuclear threat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grier|first=Peter|title=Timeline: Iran's reach for nuclear power|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2009/1130/p25s05-wome.html|accessdate=21 September 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1989: the Radiation Protection Act of Iran was ratified in public session of April 9, 1989 by the Parliament and was approved by the Council of Law-Guardians on April 19, 1989.&lt;ref name="iaea2003iran"/&gt;

1996: China and Iran inform the IAEA of plans to construct a nuclear enrichment facility in Iran, but China withdraws from the contract under U.S. pressure. Iran advises the IAEA that it plans to pursue the construction anyway.

==2002–2004==

August 2002: A spokesman for the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|MEK]] [[terrorism|terrorist]] group holds a press conference to "expose" two nuclear facilities in [[Natanz]] and [[Arak, Iran|Arak]] that they claim to have discovered. However, the sites were [http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/1274/ncri-did-not-discover-natanz already known to U.S. intelligence.] Furthermore, under the terms of Iran's then-existing safeguards agreement with the IAEA, Iran was under no obligation to disclose the facilities while they were still under construction and not yet within the 180-day time limit specified by the safeguards agreement.

December 2002: The [[United States]] accuses Iran of attempting to make [[nuclear weapon]]s.

Spring 2003: Iran makes a comprehensive [https://web.archive.org/web/20061206221201/http://www.armscontrol.org/pdf/2003_Spring_Iran_Proposal.pdf proposal of negotiations] with the United States that offers "full transparency for security that there are no Iranian endeavors to develop or possess WMD", joint decisive action against terrorists, coordination on a stable Iraq, coordination on nuclear matters, stop of any material support to Palestinian opposition groups (Hamas,
Jihad etc.) resisting Israeli occupation, and a normalization of relationships. The offer is spurned by V.P. Cheney and the Bush administration, which instead [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/17/AR2006061700727_pf.html criticizes] the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] ambassador who forwarded the offer.

June 16, 2003: [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], Director General of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], declares that "Iran failed to report certain nuclear materials and activities" and requests "co-operative actions" from the country. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] does not at this time decide to declare Iran in non-compliance with its safeguards agreement under the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/middle_east/3210412.stm | work=BBC News | title=Timeline: Iran nuclear crisis | date=November 27, 2003 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

October 21, 2003: As a confidence-building measure, Iran and the EU-3 agree to negotiations under the terms of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080522082429/http://www.armscontrol.org/country/iran/ParisAgreement.asp Paris Agreement], pursuant to which Iran agrees to temporarily suspend enrichment and permit more stringent set of nuclear inspections in accordance with the Additional Protocol, and the EU-3 explicitly recognizes Iran's right to civilian nuclear programs in accordance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The EU-3 submits a demand in August 2005 that Iran [https://web.archive.org/web/20080613001242/http://www.basicint.org/pubs/Notes/BN050811-IranEU.htm abandon enrichment] nonetheless.

October 31, 2003: After negotiations with Iran and the US on language in the IAEA document, the IAEA declares that Iran has submitted a "comprehensive" declaration of its nuclear program.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

November 11, 2003: The IAEA reports that Iran had many breaches and failures to comply with its safeguards agreement, including a "policy of concealment" from the IAEA, but also states  that there is "no evidence" that Iran is attempting to build an [[atomic bomb]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

November 13, 2003: The Bush administration claims that the IAEA conclusion of "no evidence" is "impossible to believe."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

December 18, 2003: As agreed in the Paris Agreement, Iran voluntarily signs and implements the [[Nuclear proliferation#Additional Protocol|Additional Protocol]] to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]&lt;ref name="npt-additional"&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2005/gov2005-87.pdf|title=Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran|publisher=IAEA |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Protocol was not binding on Iran until ratified, Iran voluntarily agrees to permit expanded and more intensive IAEA inspections pursuant to the Protocol, which fail to turn up a nuclear weapons program in Iran. Iran ends the voluntary implementation of Additional Protocol after two years of inspections, as a protest to continued EU-3 demands that Iran abandon all enrichment.

June 2004: [[Kamal Kharrazi]], Iran's foreign minister, responding to demands that Iran halt its nuclear program, says: "We won't accept any new obligations. Iran has a high technical capability and has to be recognised by the international community as a member of the nuclear club. This is an irreversible path." [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/06/13/wiran13.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/06/13/ixworld.html]

June 14, 2004: Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], accuses Iran of "less than satisfactory" co-operation during the IAEA investigation of its nuclear program. ElBaradei demands "accelerated and proactive cooperation" from Iran which exceed the terms of Iran's legal obligations.

July 27, 2004: Iran removes seals placed upon uranium [[centrifuge]]s by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and resumes construction of the centrifuges at Natanz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.washingtontimes.com/dynamic/stories/N/NUCLEAR_AGENCY_IRAN?SITE=DCTMS&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT (AP)] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040804005407/http://ap.washingtontimes.com/dynamic/stories/N/NUCLEAR_AGENCY_IRAN?SITE=DCTMS&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |date=2004-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2004, IAEA Director General Mohammad ElBaradei announced that the Bushehr reactor was [http://www.spacewar.com/2004/040629152639.247atsos.html "not of international concern"] since it was a bilateral Russian-Iranian project intended to produce nuclear energy.

July 31, 2004: Iran states that it has resumed building nuclear [[centrifuge]]s to enrich uranium, reversing a voluntary October 2003 pledge to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], and [[Germany]] to suspend all uranium enrichment-related activities. The United States contends that the purpose is to produce [[enriched uranium|weapons-grade]] uranium.

August 10, 2004: Several long-standing charges and questions regarding weapons-grade uranium samples found in Iran are clarified by the IAEA. Some samples match [[Pakistan]]i and Russian sources which had contaminated imported Iranian equipment from those countries. The sources of the remaining samples remain unaccounted for.

August 24, 2004: Iranian Foreign Minister [[Kamal Kharrazi]] declares in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], that Iran will retaliate with force against [[Israel]] or any nation that attempts a pre-emptive strike on its nuclear program. Earlier in the week, Israel's [[Ramatkal|Chief of Staff]], General [[Moshe Ya'alon]], told an Israeli newspaper that "Iran is striving for nuclear capability and I suggest that in this matter [Israel] not rely on others."

September 6, 2004: The latest IAEA report finds that "unresolved issues surrounding Iran's atomic program are being clarified or resolved outright".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jdw/jdw040906_1_n.shtml Iran gets mixed nuclear report - Jane's Security News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

September 18, 2004: The IAEA unanimously adopts a resolution calling on Iran to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment.

September 21, 2004: Iran announces that it will continue its nuclear program converting 37 [[ton]]nes of [[yellowcake]] [[uranium]] for processing in [[centrifuge]]s.

October 18, 2004: Iran states that it is willing to negotiate with the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], [[Germany]], and [[France]] regarding a suspension of its [[uranium enrichment]] activities, but that it will never renounce its right to enrich uranium.

October 24, 2004: The [[European Union]] makes a proposal to provide civilian nuclear technology to Iran in exchange for Iran terminating its [[uranium enrichment]] program permanently. Iran rejects this outright, saying it will not renounce its right to enrichment technologies. A decision to refer the matter from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] to the [[United Nations Security Council]] is expected on November 25, 2004.

November 15, 2004: Talks between Iran and three European Union members, the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Germany]], result in a compromise. Iran agrees to temporarily suspend its active uranium enrichment program for the duration of a second round of talks, during which attempts will be made at arriving at a permanent, mutually-beneficial solution.

November 15, 2004: A confidential [[UN]] report is leaked. The report states that all nuclear materials within Iran have been accounted for and there is no evidence of any military nuclear program. Nevertheless, it still cannot discount the possibility of such a program because it does not have perfect knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;(15 November 2004).

November 22, 2004: Iran declares that it will voluntarily suspend its uranium enrichment program to enter negotiations with the EU. Iran will review its decision in three months. The EU seeks to have the suspension made permanent and is willing to provide economic and political incentives.

November 24, 2004: Iran seeks to obtain permission from the European Union, in accordance with its recent agreement with the EU, to allow it to continue working with 24 [[centrifuge]]s for research purposes.

November 28, 2004: Iran withdraws its demand that some of its technology be exempted from a freeze on nuclear enrichment activities.&lt;ref&gt;(28 November 2004). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4049967.stm Iran offers nuclear 'concession']. BBC. Retrieved 25 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005==
Jan 17, 2005:  Iran offers a proposal to the EU.  It includes:
An Iranian commitment not to pursue weapons of mass destruction;
cooperation on combating terrorism, and on regional security, including for Iraq and Afghanistan; and
cooperation on strategic trade controls.&lt;ref name="hoop"&gt;[http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Iran_Nuclear_Proposals History of Official Proposals on the Iranian Nuclear Issue]. Arms Control Association.  Retrieved 25 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was not accepted.

Mar 23, 2005: Iran offers a proposal to the EU including: Iran’s adoption of the IAEA Additional Protocol and continuous on-site inspections at key facilities; as well as limiting the expansion of Iran’s enrichment program, and a policy declaration of no reprocessing.&lt;ref name="hoop"/&gt;  The proposal was not accepted.

June 2005: [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] said IAEA head [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] should either "toughen his stance on Iran" or fail to be chosen for a third term as the agency's head. Following a one on one meeting between Rice and ElBaradei on June 9, the United States withdrew its opposition and ElBaradei was re-elected to his position on June 13, 2005.&lt;ref name="condy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4075496.stm|title=US agrees to back UN nuclear head|publisher=BBC News | date=June 9, 2005 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

August 5, 2005: The EU-3 submit a proposal to Iran pursuant to the Paris Agreement which requires Iran to permanently cease enrichment. The proposal is rejected by Iran as a violation of the Paris Agreement and Iran's Non-Proliferation Treaty rights.

Between August 8 and August 10, 2005: Iran resumed the conversion of uranium at the Isfahan facility, under IAEA safeguards, but did not engage in enrichment of uranium.

August 9, 2005: The Iranian [[Head of State]], [[Ayatollah]] [[Ali Khamenei]], issued a [[fatwa]] forbidding the production, stockpiling and use of [[nuclear weapon]]s. The full text of the fatwa was released in an official statement at the meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in [[Vienna]].

August 11, 2005: The 35-member governing board of the IAEA adopted a resolution calling upon Iran to suspend uranium conversion, and instructing ElBaradei to submit a report on Iran's nuclear program by September 3, 2005.

August 15, 2005: Iran's new president, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], installed his new government. Iranian presidents do not have exclusive control over Iran's nuclear program, which falls mainly under the purview of Iran's Supreme Leader. [[Ali Larijani]] replaced [[Hassan Rowhani]] as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's top policy-making body, with nuclear policy in his purview.

September 15, 2005: Ahmadinejad stated at a [[United Nations]] high-level summit that Iran has the right to develop a civil nuclear-power program within the terms of the 1970 treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. He offered a compromise solution in which foreign companies would be permitted to invest and participate in Iran's nuclear program, which he said would ensure that it could not be secretly diverted to make nuclear weapons. The majority of the U.S. delegation left during his speech, but the U.S./UN mission denied there was a walkout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stewart|last=Stogel|title='No-Shows' Mark U.N.

September 24, 2005: The IAEA Board of Governors finds that the failures and breaches reported in November 2003 constitute non-compliance with Iran's safeguards agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2005/gov2005-77.pdf Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran] Resolution adopted on 24 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

October 10, 2005: Iranian Oil Ministry Deputy for International Affairs Hadi Nejad-Hosseinian said that Iran could run out of oil reserves in nine decades.&lt;ref name="oilgone"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/ntm54300.htm|title=Iran may run out of oil in 90 years|accessdate=2006-04-23|publisher=Alexander's Gas &amp; Oil Connections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

November 5, 2005: The Iranian government approved a plan that allows foreign investors to participate in the work at the Natanz uranium enrichment plant. The cabinet also authorised the AEOI to take necessary measures to attract foreign and domestic investment in the [[uranium]] enrichment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-11/06/content_3738072.htm|title=Iran to involve foreign investments in nuclear program|publisher=Xinhua|date=November 6, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007234242/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-11/06/content_3738072.htm|archivedate=October 7, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

November 19, 2005: The IAEA released a report saying that Iran blocked nuclear inspectors from the [[United Nations]] from conducting a second visit to a site known as Parchin military complex, where Iran was not legally required to allow inspections at all. The first inspections had failed to turn up any evidence of a nuclear program. IAEA Director-General [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] said in the report, "Iran's full transparency is indispensable and overdue." Separately, Iran confirmed that it had resumed the conversion of new quantities of uranium pursuant to its rights under the NPT, despite an IAEA resolution to stop such work.

==2006==
January 2006: Iran provides the European negotiating side with a six-point proposal, which includes an offer to again suspend uranium enrichment for a period of two years, pending the outcome of continued negotiations. The offer is dismissed by the Europeans, and not reported in the Western press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HB07Ak01.html| title=Sideshows on Iran's frogmarch to the UN| first = Kaveh L. | last = Afrasiabi|publisher=Asia Times|date=February 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This offer of compromise follows several other offers from Iran, all of which were summarily dismissed by the US.

January 31, 2006: The IAEA reports that "Iran has continued to facilitate access under its Safeguards Agreement as requested by the Agency ... including by providing in a timely manner the requisite declarations and access to locations" and lists outstanding issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

March 27, 2006: In a ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' article entitled "Fool Me Twice", [[Joseph Cirincione]], director for non-proliferation at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], claimed that "some senior officials have already made up their minds: They want to hit Iran." and that there "may be a co-ordinated campaign to prepare for a military strike on Iran." Joseph Cirincione also warns "that a military strike would be disastrous for the United States. It would rally the Iranian public around an otherwise unpopular regime, inflame anti-American anger around the Muslim world, and jeopardise the already fragile U.S. position in Iraq. And it would accelerate, not delay, the Iranian nuclear program. Hard-liners in Tehran would be proven right in their claim that the only thing that can deter the United States is a nuclear bomb. Iranian leaders could respond with a crash nuclear program that could produce a bomb in a few years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Fool Me Twice|publisher=[[Foreign Policy]]| date=March 27, 2006 |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Urs festival''' is an annual festival held at [[Ajmer]], a city in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]], which commemorates the death anniversary of the [[Sufi]] saint [[Moinuddin Chishti]], (founder of the Chishtiya Sufi order in India).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/797th-urs-of-khawaja-moinuddin-chisty-begins-in-ajmer-news-national-jguwargfefi.html|title=797th Urs of Khawaja Moinuddin Chisty begins in Ajmer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held over six days and features night-long dhikr/zikr [[qawwali]] singing. The anniversary is celebrated in the seventh month of the [[Islamic lunar calendar]]. Thousands of pilgrims visit the shrine from all over India and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-19/jaipur/28168314_1_nizam-gate-urs-flag-devotees-flock{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The festival==
The sixth day of the Urs is regarded as the most special and auspicious. It is called "Chhati Sharif".  It is celebrated on the 6th Rajab between 10:00 A.M. and 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. inside the Mazaar Sharif. ''Shijra'' is read by duty bound ''Khadims'' of Moinuddin Chishti, and then there is ''Fariyad'' (prayers).

Just before the ''Qu'l'' (conclusion of Chhati Sharif), ''Badhaawa'' (a poem of praise) is sung at the main entrance of the shrine by Qawwals.

Badhaawa is a recitation accompanied only by clapping; no musical instrument is played. It was composed by Syed Behlol Chishty, an ancestor of the present day Khadim community. After its recitation, the ceremony of the Qu'l comes to an end, and Fatiha is recited. The end of the ceremony is marked by firing a cannon at 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.

{{short description|World War I dead and wounded}}
&lt;!--Please do not change any casualty numbers until it has been suggested/discussed on the talk page. Sources should also be stated.--&gt;
[[File:British wounded Bernafay Wood 19 July 1916.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|British and German wounded, Bernafay Wood, 19 July 1916. Photo by [[Ernest Brooks (photographer)|Ernest Brooks]].]]
The total number of [[military]] and [[civilian casualties]] in [[World War I]] was about 40 million: estimates range from 15 to 19&amp;nbsp;million deaths and about 23&amp;nbsp;million wounded military personnel, ranking it among the [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|deadliest conflicts]] in human history.

The total number of deaths includes from 9 to 11 million [[military personnel]]. The [[civilians|civilian]] death toll was about 8 million, including about 6 million due to war-related famine and disease. The [[Triple Entente]] (also known as the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]) lost about 6 million military personnel while the [[Central Powers]] lost about 4 million. At least 2&amp;nbsp;million died from diseases and 6&amp;nbsp;million went missing, presumed dead. This article lists the casualties of the belligerent powers based on official published sources.

About two-thirds of military deaths in World War I were in battle, unlike the conflicts that took place in the 19th century when the majority of deaths were due to disease.  Nevertheless, disease, including the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and deaths while held as [[prisoners of war]], still caused about one third of total military deaths for all belligerents.
&lt;!--Please do not change any casualty numbers until it has been suggested/discussed on the talk page. Sources should also be stated.--&gt;

First World War civilian deaths are "hazardous to estimate" according to Michael Clodfelter who maintains that "the generally accepted figure of [[noncombatant]] deaths is 6.5&amp;nbsp;million."&lt;ref name="Clodfelter, Michael 2002 Page 479"&gt;Clodfelter, Michael (2002). Warfare and Armed Conflicts- A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1500–2000 2nd Ed.. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-1204-4}}. Page 479&lt;/ref&gt; The figures listed below include about 6 million excess civilian deaths due to war related privations, that are often omitted from other compilations of World War I casualties. The war brought about malnutrition and disease caused by the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-boat Campaign]] and the [[Blockade of Germany]] which disrupted trade resulting in food shortages. The civilian deaths in the [[Ottoman Empire]] include the [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Assyrian Genocide]], and [[Greek Genocide]]. Civilian deaths due to the [[Spanish flu]] have been excluded from these figures, whenever possible. The figures do not include deaths during the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Turkish War of Independence]].

== Casualties by post-war (1924) borders ==

[[File:Europe 1914 and 1924.png|thumb|Europe 1914 and 1924]]
The war involved multi-ethnic empires such as Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary and Turkey. Many ethnic groups in these territories were conscripted for military service. The casualties listed by modern borders are also included in the above table of figures for the countries that existed in 1914. The casualty figures by 1924 post war borders are rough estimates by Russian historian Vadim Erlikman in a 2004 handbook of human losses in the 20th century, the sources of his figures were published in the Soviet era and in post-Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow. {{ISBN|978-5-93165-107-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1914–1918 Online Encyclopedia "In addition to losses suffered by African military personnel and the laborers supporting their operations, very large, but unknown numbers of African civilians perished during the war."  They made an estimate of civilian losses in Africa of 750,000 based on the study by the Vadim Erlikman. They noted that Erlikman's figures are based on the work of the Russian demographer Boris Urlanis, they noted that these estimates were "imprecise" and "could be used to provide a frame of reference for further inquiry".&lt;ref name="War Losses Africa" /&gt; The ''Oxford History of World War One'' notes that "In east and central Africa the harshness of the war resulted in acute shortages of food with famine in some areas, a weakening of populations, and epidemic diseases which killed hundreds of thousands of people and also cattle."&lt;ref name="Strachan, Hew 1999 p. 100"&gt;Strachan, Hew (1999).

During World War I, the Nepalese army was expanded and six new regiments, totaling more than 20,000 troops—all volunteers—were sent to India, most of them to the North-West Frontier Province, to release British and Indian troops for service overseas. Simultaneously, the Nepalese government agreed to maintain recruitment at a level that would sustain the existing British Gurkha units and allow the establishment of additional ones. The battalions were increased to thirty-three with the addition of 55,000 new recruits and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command for service on all fronts. Many volunteers were assigned to non-combat units, such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions but they also were in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia. The Rana prime ministers urged Nepalese males to fight in the war. Of the more than 200,000 Nepalese who served in the British army, there were some 20,000 Gurkha casualties included above with the [[British Indian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;US Library of Congress ''A Country Study: Nepal''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|Denmark|&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;}} '''Denmark'''
* Denmark was neutral in the war but Germany at that time included part of Danish Schleswig. Men from this area were conscripted into the German forces and their losses are included with German casualties. Over 700 Danish merchant sailors and fisherman died, mostly due to vessels torpedoed by German submarines.&lt;ref name="Byarkivet i Horsens" /&gt;

{{note|Lux|&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;}} '''Luxembourg'''
* [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War I|Luxembourg remained under German occupation during the war]]. The government, led by Paul Eyschen, chose to remain neutral. This strategy had the approval of [[Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg]]. Some citizens were conscripted into the German forces and others escaped to volunteer for the Allies. According to the Mobile Reference travel Guide, 3,700 Luxembourgeois citizens served in the French armed forces and 2,800 gave their lives in the war. They are commemorated at the [[Gëlle Fra]] in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

{{note|Norway|&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;}}'''Norway'''
* Norway was neutral in the war but lost ships and merchant sailors in trading through the war zones. Norway is at times referred to as [[the Neutral Ally]] due to its close relationship with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] during the war. In 1924, the Norwegian government in a reply to a questionnaire from the [[International Labour Office]], an agency of the [[League of Nations]], reported 1,180 persons dead and missing in World War I.&lt;ref name="International Labour Office p.29" /&gt;

{{note|Sweden|&lt;sup&gt;az&lt;/sup&gt;}}'''Sweden'''
* Sweden was neutral in the war but lost ships and merchant sailors in trading through the war zones.

* The [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] (CWGC) Annual Report 2014–2015&lt;ref name="CWGCAR" /&gt; provides current statistics on the military dead for the [[British Empire]]. The war dead totals listed in the report are based on the research by the CWGC to identify and commemorate Commonwealth war dead. The statistics tabulated by The Commonwealth War Graves Commission are representative of the number of names commemorated for all servicemen/women of the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth and former UK Dependencies, whose death was attributable to their war service. Some auxiliary and civilian organizations are also accorded war grave status if death occurred under certain specified conditions. For the purposes of CWGC the dates of inclusion for Commonwealth War Dead are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921. Total World War I dead were 1,116,371 (UK and former colonies 887,711; Undivided India 73,895; Canada 64,997; Australia 62,123; New Zealand 18,053; South Africa 9,592).

* The official "final and corrected" casualty figures for British Army, including the Territorial Force (not including allied [[British Empire]] forces) were issued on 10 March 1921. The losses were for the period 4 August 1914 until 30 September 1919, included 573,507 "killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes"; 254,176 missing less 154,308 released prisoners; for a net total of 673,375 dead and missing.

However many published reference works list total British Empire(including the Dominions) losses at 908,371, it is implicit in these presentations that the figures for total losses include the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name="EPFW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 2001 269 70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World War I 2010 Page 219" /&gt;
* The War Office report puts the number of "soldiers who lost their lives" from the British Regular Army and Royal Naval Division at 702,410.&lt;ref name="The War Office 1922 p.239" /&gt; This is not in agreement with the "final and corrected" figures in the 1921 report for the army published in the General Annual Report of the British Army 1912–1919, which put British Army dead and missing at 673,375 and the official compilation of Army war dead published in 1921 that put total losses at about 673,000.&lt;ref name="The Army Council 1919. pp. 62" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soldiers died in the great war, 1914–1919, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1920–1921&lt;/ref&gt; The War Office report did not explain the reason for this discrepancy; the difference is more than likely due to their inclusion of the [[Royal Naval Division]] and deaths outside of combat theaters.&lt;ref name="Dumas, Samuel 1923 p. 139" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Per MOS:BOLDTITLE and WP:SBE, neither the article's title nor related text appears in bold. --&gt;On 21 November 2013 the roof of the Zolitūde shopping centre in the [[Zolitūde]] neighbourhood of [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], collapsed at 17:41 local time resulting in the deaths of 54 people, including three rescue workers, and injuries to another 41 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trīs Zolitūdē cietušie uzsāk rehabilitāciju, slimnīcās turpina ārstēties vēl 13|url=http://nra.lv/latvija/106986-tris-zolitude-cietusie-uzsak-rehabilitaciju-slimnicas-turpina-arsteties-vel-13.htm|work=nra.lv|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nra.lv/latvija/109599-zolitudes-tragedija-54-cilvekiem-nave-iestajas-acumirkli.htm|title=Zolitūdes traģēdija: 54 cilvēkiem nāve iestājās acumirklī|last=Paparde|first=Inga|date=16 January 2014|publisher=nra.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An unknown number of people were able to leave the store on their own after the initial collapse.&lt;ref name ="nra nelaime vienoti"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nra.lv/latvija/106626-nelaime-vienoti.htm|title=Nelaimē vienoti|last=Šteinfelde|first=Ilze|date=25 November 2013|publisher=nra.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the worst disaster in Latvia since 1950, when the steamer ''[[Mayakovsky (ship)|Mayakovsky]]'' sank in Riga, killing 147 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:Как тонул "Маяковский" |language=Russian |trans-title=How the "Mayakovsky" sank |newspaper=ЧАС |publisher=Petits |location=Latvia |date=26 October 2005 |url=http://www.chas-daily.com/win/2005/10/26/g_056.html?r=32&amp; |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building overview==
The building, which contained a [[Maxima Group|Maxima]] supermarket and other businesses, was completed on 3 November 2011. Architectural design was by Zane Kalinka and Andris Kalinka from the local architectural firm KUBS. It was developed by Homburg Valda and built by the [[Re&amp;Re]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grocery Roof Collapse Kills 51 in Latvia |url= https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303653004579213200159484692 |date=22 November 2013 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the building was finished, it won the Latvian Building of the Year award. Several months before its opening, a fire broke out in the market in which nobody was injured. At the time of the collapse, construction by Re&amp;Re was taking place. The area of the shopping centre was {{convert|4750|m2|sqft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="a4d"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maxima Zolitūdē |publisher=a4d.lv |date=23 November 2011 |url=http://www.a4d.lv/lv/projekti/maxima-zolitude/ |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the building cost around €1.4 million. The shopping centre was located in a part of the building owned by SIA Tineo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maxima sniedz savu skaidrojumu par notikušo |language=Latvian |location=Latvia |publisher=BNN |url=http://bnn.lv/maxima-sniedz-savu-skaidrojumu-par-notikuso-125406 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maxima: Signalizācija Zolitūdes veikalā ieslēgusies aptuveni 10 reizes; ēkas tehniskā pārbaude veikta šomēnes |language=Latvian |work=[[Diena]] |url= http://www.diena.lv/latvija/zinas/papildinats-12-46-maxima-signalizacija-zolitudes-veikala-ieslegusies-aptuveni-10-reizes-ekas-tehnisk-14033895 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was originally owned by The Homburg Group, which still owns the adjacent apartment building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ušakovs: Maxima grausts tiks nojaukts |language=Latvian |work=Diena |url= http://www.diena.lv/latvija/zinas/papildinats-15-18-usakovs-maxima-grausts-tiks-nojaukts-14033968 |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tineo is an [[offshore company]] owned by the Maxima group, a retail chain with operations mostly in the [[Baltic states]], which owns the "Maxima XX" supermarket in the building. The company initially claimed it was a tenant of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zolitūdē sagruvušais veikals tomēr pieder "Maxima" grupai |language=Latvian |publisher=tvnet.lv |date=25 November 2013 |url= http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/487624-zolitude_sagruvusais_veikals_tomer_pieder_maxima_grupai |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building also contained a bank, a beauty salon, a currency exchange, a newsagent's and a pet shop.
There were plans for a layer of [[topsoil]] {{convert|20|-|30|cm}} thick on the roof; small recreational spots with benches, connected by cobblestone-paved paths, were planned for the resident of an apartment house that was part of the same complex.&lt;ref name="a4d"/&gt; Before the collapse, construction of the green roof was in progress, as was construction of underground car parking in the basement, intended for residents of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Maxima": Pēc signalizācijas atskanēšanas draudi cilvēku dzīvībai netika konstatēti |language=Latvian |work=Nozare |date=22 November 2013 |url=http://www.nozare.lv/business/top/B31B1B11-7EBA-48F0-B28C-2BEEC4A04BCB/ |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collapse  ==
[[File:First hours after Maxima roof collapse..jpg|thumb|Rescuers gathered near the entrance of the store]]
Eyewitnesses said that at around 16:21 a fire alarm was set off and there were announcements made that the store should be evacuated. Security personnel verified this to be related to welding construction in the basement and switched off the alarm. It was later reported that the owner of the company which had installed the alarm said that it was designed to detect fire emergencies. He said it is unlikely that the alarm was set off by dust from the roof starting to collapse, as it was set off near water pipes in the basement. The store's security verified that there was no fire and therefore did not carry out an evacuation, but rather treated it as a false alarm and called a technician to turn it off. The building collapsed shortly after the technician arrived and he was not able to verify why the alarm had gone off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kāpēc ignorēja trauksmes signalizāciju? |language=Latvian |publisher=lsm.lv |date=22 November 2013 |url=http://www.lsm.lv/lv/analize/zinju-analiize/kapec-ignoreja-trauksmes-signalizaciju.a70538/ |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A board member of "Maxima Latvija" said that security had followed protocol, which was not to evacuate if there was no visible danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Traģēdija 'Maxima': cilvēki netika evakuēti no veikala, jo nebija acīmredzamu ugunsgrēka pazīmju |language=Latvian |agency=BNS |location=Latvia |publisher=Delfi.lv |date=2013-11-22 |url= http://www.delfi.lv/news/national/politics/tragedija-maxima-cilveki-netika-evakueti-no-veikala-jo-nebija-acimredzamu-ugunsgreka-pazimju.d?id=43839030 |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some reports, the smaller shops in the retail centre, unlike Maxima, were evacuated and closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:ЧП в Золитуде: 53 погибших, трое из них — спасатели |language=Russian |trans-title=Emergency situation in Zolitūde: 53 perished, three of them rescuers |location=Latvia |publisher=rus.delfi.lv |date=2013-11-21 |url= http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/criminal/chp-v-zolitude-53-pogibshih-troe-iz-nih-spasateli.d?id=43837110 |accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many customers, however, stayed in the store, encouraged by the calm demeanor of Maxima's employees. Some employees of the smaller shops also started returning to their workplaces after being told by security that it was a false alarm. It has also been reported by witnesses that at around 17:00 the alarm was turned off.&lt;ref name="ir zarks"/&gt;

The roof caved in at 17:41 local time. Because the collapse occurred during peak shopping hours, it was suspected that at least a hundred people may have been in the store during the collapse. Eyewitnesses said the roof collapsed over the [[Point of sale|checkout counters]], where many people were waiting to pay, and over the dairy, alcoholic beverage and [[household chemicals]] sections.&lt;ref name="ir zarks"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nevainīgais zārks|last=Puķe|first=Ieva|author2=Anita Brauna |date=28 November 2013|publisher=Ir|pages=14–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by police who released a map based on CCTV footage just before the collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Veikala karte. Kuras teritorijas vēl jāpārmeklē |language=Latvian |publisher=ltv.lv |date=19 November 2013 |url= http://www.ltv.lv/lv/raksts/23.11.2013-veikala-karte.-kuras-teritorijas-vel-japarmekle.id20928/ |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported that the collapse started over counters 6, 7 and 8. There were more than 50 employees working in the various stores in the building and an uncertain number of customers that might have been in the building, many of whom were able to escape before rescuers arrived.&lt;ref name ="nra nelaime vienoti"/&gt; Most of the store lost electrical power due to damage caused by the collapse, which resulted in the main door locking and trapping several people inside the store, people had to break the glass to escape.&lt;ref name="ir zarks"/&gt; The roof fell into the building, and also onto several cars parked outside the store.

The firefighters, ambulances and police arrived at the scene within minutes. After the initial collapse, firefighters divided the building into four working areas. Although it had initially seemed that the remaining roof construction posed no further danger, at 19:04 another part of the roof collapsed over one of the previously designated work areas, trapping several [[firefighter]]s, injuring twelve and killing three of them.&lt;ref name="VUGD nepatiesibas"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.delfi.lv/news/zolitudes-tragedija/tragedija-zolitude-vugd-atspeko-dazas-nepatiesibas.d?id=43856412|title=Traģēdija Zolitūdē: VUGD atspēko dažas nepatiesības|date=28 November 2013|publisher=delfi.lv|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Maximas" traģēdijas notikumu hronoloģija |language=Latvian |publisher=nra.lv |date=25 November 2013 |url=http://nra.lv/latvija/106620-maximas-tragedijas-notikumu-hronologija.htm |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:ЧП в Золитуде: пострадали более 30 человек, 47 погибших, трое из них — спасатели (09.04) |language=Russian |trans-title=Emergency situation in Zolitūde: More than 30 injured, 47 dead, three of them rescuers (09:04) |location=Latvia |publisher=rus.delfi.lv |date=2013-11-21 |url= http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/criminal/chp-v-zolitude-postradali-bolee-30-chelovek-32-pogibshih-troe-iz-nih-spasateli-0904.d?id=43837110  |accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diena"&gt;{{cite news|title=papildināts (09:45) – Maxima traģēdijā 25 bojāgājušie un 40 izglābtie; drupās aizvien dzirdami telefonu zvani |language=Latvian |newspaper=Diena |date=22 November 2013 |url= http://www.diena.lv/latvija/zinas/papildinats-09-45-maxima-tragedija-25-bojagajusie-un-40-izglabtie-drupas-aizvien-dzirdami-telefonu-z-14033795 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time 20 people – most of those injured in the first collapse – had been rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/489121-lidz_otrajam_nobrukam_maxima_vugd_izglaba_20_cilveku_lielako_dalu_izdzivojuso|title= Līdz otrajam nobrukumam Maximā VUGD izglāba 20 cilvēku – lielāko daļu izdzīvojušo|date=5 December 2013|publisher=tvnet.lv|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injured were transferred to the [[Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital]], the Riga East Clinical university hospital, the Riga Second hospital, and the Traumatology and Orthopedic hospital. One child was transferred to the Clinical University Hospital for children.

Both before and after the second collapse, only firefighters were allowed to enter the building, and anyone inside was pulled out and brought to the ambulances parked just outside the store. After the second collapse, it was reported that only five firefighters were allowed to enter the building at a time, and that the rest were forced to wait outside because of the danger of further collapse.&lt;ref name="VUGD priekshnieks"/&gt; Each firefighter was allowed to spend only half an hour working. Bulldozers were used to clear the rubble. Mobile [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s were deployed at 21:27 to lift concrete slabs.&lt;ref name="VUGD nepatiesibas"/&gt;

According to a Latvian army tweet, 110 soldiers were on site on 21 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Latvijas_armija/status/403643688095457280|title=NBS twitter channel|date=21 November 2013|publisher=@Latvijas_armija|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several tents were installed for the use of firefighters and ambulance workers by the military. Latvia was offered aid by several countries, however it was turned down as State and fire rescue service believed they already had the required manpower, equipment and experience for the rescue operation.&lt;ref name="VUGD nepatiesibas"/&gt;

At least one silent period was used to listen for signs of life among the rubble; some cell phones were heard ringing.&lt;ref name="VUGD priekshnieks"&gt;{{cite news |title=VUGD priekšnieks: Glābšanas darbi varētu turpināties vēl vismaz diennakti |language=Latvian |newspaper=Diena |date=22 November 2013 |url= http://www.diena.lv/latvija/riga/vugd-prieksnieks-glabsanas-darbi-varetu-turpinaties-vel-vismaz-diennakti-14033867 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of thermal scanners and [[Search and rescue dog]]s was also tried, however this proved unsuccessful as concrete rubble was too thick to detect warmth and dogs were distracted by the strong scent of household chemicals and alcohol that had leaked from broken packing.&lt;ref name="VUGD nepatiesibas"/&gt;

Another fireman was reported to have been injured during clearing of the rubble in the early hours of 23 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No sabrukušās "Maximas" ar acs traumu slimnīcā nogādāts glābējs |language=Latvian |publisher=nra.lv |date=23 November 2013 |url=http://nra.lv/latvija/106510-no-sabrukusas-maximas-ar-acs-traumu-slimnica-nogadats-glabejs.htm |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another collapse occurred at 17:52 on 23 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McGuinness |first=Damien |title=Remaining section of Latvia supermarket roof collapses |format=video |publisher=BBC News |date=23 November 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25069941 |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the rescuers were harmed in this subsequent collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zolitūdes "Maximā" noticis vēl viens nobrukums |language=Latvian |publisher=nra.lv |date=23 November 2013 |url=http://nra.lv/latvija/106547-zolitudes-maxima-noticis-vel-viens-nobrukums.htm |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the third collapse compromised the structural integrity of the roof, rescue efforts were stopped at around 19:00, A representative of the paramedics said that, given the severity of injuries the bodies of the latest victims had, they had no hope anyone else might still be alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pārtrauc glābšanas darbus; vairs nav cerību atrast izdzīvojušos |language=Latvian |publisher=nra |date=23 November 2013 |url=http://nra.lv/latvija/106551-partrauc-glabsanas-darbus-vairs-nav-ceribu-atrast-izdzivojusos.htm |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and cause==
The inquiry into the collapse began just minutes after it occurred. The police investigated three theories: first, that there was an error in [[structural design]], and authorities overseeing planning had been negligent; second, that the cause is related to initial building procedures; third, that it was caused by the construction of the green roof.&lt;ref name="rt-1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Policijai trīs versijas par negadījuma iemesliem |language=Latvian |publisher=lsm.lv |date=22 November 2013 |url=http://www.lsm.lv/lv/zinas/latvija/policijai-triis-versijas-par-negadiijuma-iemesliem.a70485/ |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a related case on 27 February 2014 a man was fined for [[signature forgery]] on documents related to construction works in 2011. The police announced this finding in March, but did not disclose any further information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/kriminalzinas/500699-zolitudes_tragedijas_lieta_atklaj_viltotus_buvniecibas_dokumentus|title= Zolitūdes traģēdijas lietā atklāj viltotus būvniecības dokumentus|date=10 March 2014|publisher=tvnet.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvian Television]] ran a report in April alleging that the person fined was owner of a now liquidated company MONCE – a subcontractor hired to install the metal constructions of the building by the manufacturer of the constructions Vikom Industry. Instead of hiring a certified building engineer to oversee the installation, the company had forged the documents using the name of an engineer, whom they previously had offered a job and paid him a salary of 5.95 [[Latvian lat|lats]] from January to April 2011, which he actually never received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ltv.lv/lv/raksts/20.04.2014-oficialais-darbu-vadiitajs-zolitude-nav-stradajis.id28069/|title=Oficiālais darbu vadītājs Zolitūdē nav strādājis|date=20 April 2014|publisher=LTV|language=Latvian|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation of the cause of collapse was hindered by the collapsed building still being unsafe to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nra.lv/latvija/108308-policija-atskaitas-ko-paveikusi-menesa-laika-pec-maximas-tragedijas.htm|title=Policija atskaitās, ko paveikusi mēneša laikā pēc "Maximas" traģēdijas|date=20 December 2013|publisher=nra.lv|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining constructions were reinforced by March 2014. From April 2014, investigators were finally able to enter the building, where they recovered evidence buried by the third collapse of the roof and carried out investigation experiments – a controlled collapse of the remaining section of the roof and controlled fires, to test what loads the roof could carry and if the building's structures could have been compromised in the fire which occurred during its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/506153-zolitudes_veikala_maxima_konstrukcijas_brucinasana|title=Zolitūdes veikala "Maxima" konstrukcijas brucināšana|date=15 April 2014|publisher=Tvnet|language=Latvian|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary findings from the controlled collapse, which took place from 14 April to 17 April showed prolonged deformation of the metal support structures, which started well before the target weight of the roof was reached and ended with the constructions eventually breaking, suggesting that the roof was built improperly and the actual collapse was not caused by a sudden change, but by overloading structures for a prolonged period of time and possibly [[metal fatigue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/506415-eksperimenta_zolitudes_lielveikala_jumta_konstrukcijas_parluzusas|title= Eksperimentā Zolitūdes lielveikala jumta konstrukcijas pārlūzušas|date=17 April 2014|publisher=tvnet|language=Latvian|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/viedokli/506197-generalprokurors_pielautas_butiskas_kludas_maxima_jumta_izbuve|title= Ģenerālprokurors: pieļautas būtiskas kļūdas "Maxima" jumta izbūvē|date=16 April 2014|publisher=tvnet|language=Latvian|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two controlled fires were set on 27 May.

In January 2015 the first suspects were named – construction engineer Ivars Sergets, design expert Andris Gulbis and architect Andris Kalinka. In addition the assets of HND Grupa (a company owned by Sergets) and Kubs (owned by Kalinka and his sister) were frozen. It is unclear what the architect is suspected for as both the investigators and his representatives refused to comment. Sergets is suspected of making an error in the designs of the building's roof constructions. Gulbis is suspected of negligence as he was supposed to inspect and approve the design, but failed to notice the error. Prosecutor general Ēriks Kalnmeiers cautioned that the investigation is still ongoing and there will be more suspects. He said that the way the building was designed meant it was bound to collapse, however, the investigation had uncovered other factors that contributed to the collapse occurring at a particular time and therefore resulting in deaths, as well as numerous unrelated violations, which speak of a general tendency to disregard regulations, therefore everyone who had been neglectful contributed to the accident and should be held responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maximalietas pirmais izrāviens|last=Mače|first=Zane|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Ir|pages=18–21|language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initial speculations on the cause===
According to Re &amp; Re's preliminary report, the cause was likely a design error. The report is a result of three independent civil engineers' examination of the project documentation. The rooftop garden was included in the original design, but the building was still "designed with insufficient load carrying capacity, three times less than required". The report states that the main reasons for the collapse are faulty estimation of the maximum load to be carried by the roof, and the design of the connections in the structural steel supporting the roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Design fault likely caused Latvia roof cave-in |publisher=www.globalpost.com |date=29 November 2013 |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/131129/design-fault-likely-caused-latvia-roof-cave|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Re&amp;Re engineers: Zolitude disaster was due to erroneous calculations of maximum loads |publisher=www.baltic-course.com |date=29 November 2013 |url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/real_estate/?doc=84380|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ivars Sergets, the owner of the HND Grupa which was responsible for the construction of the building, the collapse may have been caused by overload, created by materials being loaded onto weaker points of the roof. He rejected the possibility that the disaster had been caused by the design of the garden, since the store had been operating for two winters and the stress created by the weight of snow had been up to twice as great as the stress caused by the garden at the time of the collapse. He pointed out that too many of the building materials were stored on the roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sabrukušajā lielveikalā līdz šim atrasti 47 bojāgājušie: Teksta tiešraide |location=Latvia |publisher=apollo |date=22 November 2013 |url= http://www.apollo.lv/zinas/sabrukusaja-lielveikala-lidz-sim-atrasti-45-bojagajusie-teksta-tiesraide/623454 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, however, he admitted that trusses made of two pieces bolted together were used, while the original design called for a single truss. This was a result of issues with transporting longer trusses to the building site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Būvkompānija atzīst, ka sākotnējais sagruvušā "Maxima" jumta projekts mainīts |language=Latvian |publisher=nra.lv |date=24 November 2013 |url= http://nra.lv/latvija/106598-buvkompanija-atzist-ka-sakotnejais-sagruvusa-maxima-jumta-projekts-mainits.htm |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lilita Ozola, an engineer teaching at the Latvian University of Agriculture, suggested that for changing the trusses the entire design plan should have been revised and reapproved by authorities. With the two-piece trusses installed, the joint between them would bear most of the roof's weight. She pointed out that there is a video recording of the shopping centre's roof collapsing in which it is obvious that it failed at the exact position of the joints. She also criticised construction work taking place on the roof when there were people in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Traģēdijas vainīgos var atklāt! |language=Latvian |publisher=tvnet.lv |date=26 November 2013 |url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/viedokli/487638-tragedijas_vainigos_var_atklat |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toomas Kaljas, who claims to be a [[structural engineer]] working for a Finnish company, has published research based on photographs from the site, suggesting the connections between the horizontal bars that held the roof were inadequately designed. The garden on the roof played a minimal role. The load on the [[screw|bolts]] that were holding the bars was uneven and there were too few of them. The calculations of forces applied to bolts were wrong. A better design would have resulted in components bending and cracking over time, instead of the whole building suddenly collapsing like [[dominoes]] without warning.&lt;ref name="arileht.delfi.ee"&gt;{{cite news |title=Insener: Riia kaubanduskeskus oli nagu rotilõks, hoone oli valesti projekteeritud ja tugevusarvutused olid valed |language=Estonian |trans-title=Engineer: The mall was like a rat trap, the building was wrongly designed and durability calculations were wrong |work=Ärileht |publisher=Delfi |location=Estonia |date=24 November 2013 |url= http://arileht.delfi.ee/news/uudised/insener-riia-kaubanduskeskus-oli-nagu-rotiloks-hoone-oli-valesti-projekteeritud-ja-tugevusarvutused-olid-valed.d?id=67149494 |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="postimees.ee_2608210"&gt;{{cite news |title=Insener Riia kaubanduskeskuse varingust: odav arvutiprogramm ei asenda häid insenere |language=Estonian |trans-title=Engineer on Riga mall collapse: A cheap computer program does not supplant good engineers |publisher=[[Postimees]] |location=Estonia |date=24 November 2013 |url=

He found that these are not strong enough.{{clarify||reason=Were the bolts not as strong as they should be (manufacturing fault) or were the bolts used too weak for the purpose (human error)?|date=December 2013}} A solution would have been to either get stronger nuts, or place two of them on the end of the same bolt. According to Toomas, the building designer should have issued a standard for the required nuts or, if not, then the builders should have asked for it. He thinks all public buildings that use these bolts should get additional nuts.

According to a press representative of Kubs, the architect bureau that designed the building, the possibly faulty metal joint components were supplied by Vikom Industry. The management at Vikom Industry had said that they were unable to provide single-piece components and offered components that would be assembled out of two halves, but which would be just as strong as the ones ordered. Therefore, according to Kubs, Vikom Industry is solely responsible for the component and bolt force and strength calculations. Vladislavs Podgurskis, a representative of Vikom Industry, said in response that all metal components were made and assembled strictly according to the building design and that it must be a design error.&lt;ref name="delfi.ee_67153842"&gt;{{cite news |title=Riia poe projekteerijad Delfile: katastroofi põhjuste osas tasub vaadata metallitehase poole |language=Estonian |trans-title=Designers of the Riga store to Delfi: One should look at the metal plant as to the reasons of the disaster |location=Estonia |publisher=Delfi |date=25 November 2013 |url= http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/valismaa/riia-poe-projekteerijad-delfile-katastroofi-pohjuste-osas-tasub-vaadata-metallitehase-poole.d?id=67153842 |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikom Industry said the bolts for joining the trusses had been supplied by the Eurobolts company. On 25 November Vikom Industry requested a manufacturer's certificate from Eurobolts for a certain batch of bolts. The owner and CEO of Eurobolts, Olga Romanova, said that the company has no information on what the bolts they sell are used for, however, the bolts in the batch Vikom Industry was interested in were not strong enough for joining trusses for the roof and that Vikom Industry had in fact never bought bolts that would be strong enough for that purpose. She added that judging from photographs of the trusses on the scene of the incident even smaller bolts were used. An anonymous fireman told TV3 News that the bolts he had seen on scene had not been broken, rather pulled out from fastenings, indicating the bolts were not designed for bearing the weight of the roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pieprasīti skrūvju ražotāja sertifikāti pirms trīs gadiem pirktām skrūvēm |language=Latvian |publisher=tvnet.lv |date=26 November 2013 |url= http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/487817-pieprasiti_skruvju_razotaja_sertifikati_pirms_tris_gadiem_pirktam_skruvem |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vice director of the Latvian Fire Safety and Civil Defence College, Vilis Students, who participated in the rescue work, said that the concrete components seemed unexpectedly fragile. Translated quote: "''I am no specialist, but we could break the roof components with hammers and pliers. During exercises with concrete objects, we usually had to use a [[jackhammer]].''"&lt;ref name="delfi.ee_67153120"&gt;{{cite news |title=Päästja: kaubanduskeskuse betoonkonstruktsioonid olid kahtlaselt haprad |language=Estonian |trans-title=Rescuer: The concrete components of the mall were suspiciously fragile |publisher=Delfi |location=Estonia |date=25 November 2013 |url= http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/valismaa/paastja-kaubanduskeskuse-betoonkonstruktsioonid-olid-kahtlaselt-haprad.d?id=67153120  |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maxima staff, the building had been dangerously unstable for about a year. The construction workers had told them that the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] was cracked and needed reinforcement. At one point the storage room and store workers' locker room was completely flooded. There had also been extra support columns under the ceiling of the storage room, but those had been removed later. The fire alarm sounded frequently. The staff believe that the reason for the alarm was that it was obsolete and could not distinguish smoke from dust. The workers did not want to testify about this in front of a camera because they feared for their jobs.&lt;ref name="postimees.ee_2608880"&gt;{{cite news |title=Riia Maxima töötajad: hoones oli defekte juba ammu |language=Estonian |trans-title=Riga Maxima employees: There were defects in the building for a long while |agency=TVNET/DIENA/PM |location=Estonia |publisher=Postimees |date=25 November 2013 |url=http://www.postimees.ee/2608880/riia-maxima-tootajad-hoones-oli-defekte-juba-ammu |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="delfi.ee_67153296"&gt;{{cite news |title=Riia Maxima töötajad: hoonega oli juba ammu midagi viltu |language=Estonian |trans-title=Riga Maxima employees: Something was wrong with the building for a long while |location=Estonia |publisher=Delfi |date=25 November 2013 |url= http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/valismaa/riia-maxima-tootajad-hoonega-oli-juba-ammu-midagi-viltu.d?id=67153296 |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political reaction ==
On 23 November, [[President of Latvia|Latvian President]] [[Andris Bērziņš (Latvian President)|Andris Bērziņš]] stated that the collapse was a "murder of defenseless people" and that the "perpetrators should be arrested", and that the inquiry needed independent experts from other countries who are not associated with Latvian builders in any possible way. He also said that the entire political system needs to be changed as it allows individuals to escape responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Президент: трагедия в Maxima — массовое убийство |language=Russian |location=Latvia |url= http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/latvia/prezident-tragediya-v-maxima-massovoe-ubijstvo.d?id=43841544 |date=23 November 2013 |publisher=DELFI |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC News Riga correspondent reported that the president wanted a criminal investigation "led by independent investigators from abroad – implying that powerful business interests in Latvia are too closely entwined with politics to ensure a fair and honest investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McGuinness |first=Damien |title=Latvia president calls supermarket collapse 'murder' |publisher=BBC News |date=23 November 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25068291 |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prime Minister of Latvia|Latvian Prime Minister]] [[Valdis Dombrovskis]] resigned on 27 November. He said that the country needed strong government with support in parliament at the moment of crisis and that he was thus taking responsibility for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/487961-valdis_dombrovskis_pazino_par_atkapsanos_no_amata |title=Valdis Dombrovskis paziņo par atkāpšanos no amata |date=27 November 2013 |publisher=tvnet.lv |language=Latvian |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said he had considered this in the days after the tragedy and had made a final decision during a meeting with the president, but denied the president had asked him to step down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.delfi.lv/news/national/politics/dombrovskis-uznemas-atbildibu-par-tragediju-zolitude-krit-valdiba-teksta-tiesraide.d?id=43851844 |title=Dombrovskis uzņemas atbildību par traģēdiju Zolitūdē – krīt valdība |date=27 November 2013 |publisher=delfi.lv |language=Latvian |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion polls indicate that most people want mayor of Riga [[Nils Ušakovs]] to also step down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/viedokli/487980-usakovam_jaatkapjas_no_amata |title=Ušakovam jāatkāpjas no amata! |date=27 November 2013 |publisher=tvnet.lv |language=Latvian |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As political commentator Aivars Ozoliņš points out, since the Riga city council controls the local building authority responsible for the quality of buildings in Riga it was Ušakovs, not Dombrovskis, who should have taken political responsibility for the incident. Soon after the collapse several experts cited abolishing state building inspection among the reasons why control over building processes has lessened. This was done as a result of budget cuts during the global economic crisis as it was thought that municipal building authorities perform the same tasks. This was done in 2009 by the government of Valdis Dombrovskis. Ušakovs has cited this as the reason why the government of Dombrovskis was responsible; however he himself was a member of the [[Saeima]] when this decision was made and supported it in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/487789-rigas_mers_savulaik_pats_balsojis_par_valsts_buvinspekcijas_likvidesanu |title=Rīgas mērs savulaik pats balsojis par Valsts būvinspekcijas likvidēšanu |date=26 November 2013 |publisher=tvnet.lv |language=Latvian |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.delfi.lv/news/comment/comment/aivars-ozolins-ir-atkapies-usakov.d?id=43854040#ixzz2lwozmRdg |title=Aivars Ozoliņš, 'Ir': Atkāpies, Ušakov! |last=Ozoliņš |first=Aivars |date=28 November 2013 |publisher=delfi.lv |language=Latvian |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident also caused some tension between Latvia and [[Lithuania]] after the top management of the Lithuanian-owned chain refused to take any responsibility for the incident. In particular, the CEO of Maxima Latvija, Gintaras Jasinskas, when asked if he had considered stepping down like Dombrovskis, caused outrage by saying "Why? Those who feel guilty should step down. I can look people in the eye". This was condemned by several Latvian politicians and the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the Lithuanian ambassador to express official condemnation.

On 11 November 2014 members of the 12th convocation of Saeima, at the request of 36 deputies, voted in favour of establishing the Zolitūde tragedy parliamentary investigatory committee.{{efn|The full name of the Committee is ”Parliamentary Committee for Investigating the Actions Taken by the State of Latvia in Assessing the Causes of the Tragedy in Zolitūde on 21 November 2013, Improving the Legislative Framework and Practical Measures to be Taken by the Public Administration and Municipalities in Order to Prevent Recurrence of Similar Tragedies, as well as Mitigating the Consequences of the Tragedy”.}}&lt;ref name=SP&gt;{{cite web|title=Par parlamentārās izmeklēšanas|trans-title=Parliamentary Inquiry|publisher=[[Saeima]]|url=http://likumi.lv/ta/id/270273-par-parlamentaras-izmeklesanas-komisijas-izveidosanu-par-latvijas-valsts-ricibu-izvertejot-2013-gada-21-novembri-zolitude}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was appointed for the period of 12 months&lt;ref name=SP/&gt; to investigate the actions taken by the state of Latvia in assessing the causes of the tragedy as well as measures taken by the government to prevent the recurrence of similar tragedies and mitigate the consequences of the tragedy.

The committee devoted most of its attention to issues in the construction sector of the economy, including state and municipal supervision of the construction sector (especially the dissolution of the State Construction Inspection Office and the creation of the National Construction Control Agency), quality of construction engineering education and the certification system, public procurement in construction sector, supervision of the market of construction materials and other questions. Addressing issues related to civil defence and social assistance, the committee in its sittings examined the following topics: competence of the employees of the security company ; cooperation between rescue services and municipalities in emergency situations, coordination of emergency response and mitigation of accident impact, resources of the responsible services; involvement of non-government organisations in emergency situations, in organizing social support; emergency social care package offered by the state and municipalities, and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;Zolitūdes traģēdijas parlamentārās izmeklēšanas komisijas sēžu protokli Nr. 5.-19., http://zolitude.saeima.lv/komisijas-sezu-protokoli&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
A protest movement against the parties involved sprung up after the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nra.lv/latvija/106752-aicina-uz-protesta-akcijam-pret-zolitudes-tragedija-iesaistitajiem.htm|title=Aicina uz protesta akcijām pret Zolitūdes traģēdijā iesaistītajiem|date=26 November 2013|publisher=nra.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxima stores were boycotted due in part to statements by its management after the shopping centre's roof collapsed, and also due to reports of [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] and poor product quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nra.lv/latvija/106758-maximas-veikaliem-draud-boikots.htm|title="Maximas" veikaliem draud boikots|last=Šteinfelde|first=Ilze|date=27 November 2013|publisher=nra.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several employees, including those that worked in the collapsed store, told media that they received insufficient safety instructions, fire escape doors were blocked, they were not allowed to leave work without permission even to visit the toilet and would have their pay reduced if they failed to comply. The stores would also keep only a few checkout counters open in order to save money, causing long lines to form, requiring employees to work long hours, while paying the [[minimum wage]]. Maxima was also criticised for apparently intimidating workers to keep them from reporting discrepancies to authorities, talking to media or joining a trade union.&lt;ref name="ir zarks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lsm.lv/lv/raksts/zinju-analiize/analize/maxima-par-visu-ir-padomats-tikai-ne-par-darbiniekiem.a71308/|title="Maxima": Par visu ir padomāts… tikai ne par darbiniekiem|last=Dzērve|first=Laura|date=3 December 2013|publisher=lsm.lv|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was also accused of lying in the wake of the tragedy for initially denying owning the building and for saying that their safety instructions, which required evacuation only when it had been verified there was obvious danger, had been approved by the State Fire and Rescue Service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lsm.lv/lv/raksts/zinju-analiize/analize/de-facto-maximas-melu-apkopojums.a71208/|title="De facto": "Maximas" melu apkopojums|last=Bagone|first=Linda|date=1 December 2013|publisher=lsm.lv|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also have been protests against Maxima in Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nra.lv/pasaule/107057-lietuviesi-uzsak-protesta-akciju-pret-maximu-un-davina-skruves.htm|title=Lietuvieši uzsāk protesta akciju pret "Maximu" un dāvina skrūves|date=1 December 2013|publisher=nra.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Andris Bērziņš (Latvian President)|Latvian president]] stated that the Saturday, Sunday and Monday immediately following the disaster would be days of mourning and sent condolences to Armenia in response to the death of one of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=47 dead, two dozens feared trapped after Latvia mall collapse |publisher=tert.am |date=2013-11-22 |url=http://www.tert.am/en/news/2013/11/22/forty/ |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spelmanu nakts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Saistībā ar traģēdiju Zolitūdē atcelta 'Spēlmaņu nakts' ceremonija |language=Latvian |location=Latvia |publisher=DELFI  |date=22 November 2013 |url= http://www.delfi.lv/kultura/news/theatre/saistiba-ar-tragediju-zolitude-atcelta-spelmanu-nakts-ceremonija.d?id=43839112 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Traģēdijas dēļ atcelta virkne kultūras pasākumu |language=Latvian |location=Latvia |publisher=DELFI |date=22 November 2013 |url= http://www.delfi.lv/kultura/news/culturenvironment/tragedijas-del-atcelta-virkne-kulturas-pasakumu.d?id=43839164 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayor of Riga [[Nils Ušakovs]] said that the Maxima building would be demolished and have a memorial built in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ушаков: здание Maxima снесут, на его месте будет мемориал |language=Russian |location=Latvia |publisher=DELFI |date=23 November 2013 |url= http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/latvia/ushakov-zdanie-maxima-snesut-na-ego-meste-budet-memorial.d?id=43841582 |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2013-11-25 lv.wikipedia.org (SeaMonkey 1.1.19).png|thumb|right|[[Latvian Wikipedia]] with dark logo]]
Several Latvian websites, including the [[Latvian Wikipedia|Latvian ''Wikipedia'']], changed their logo designs to include black and images of candles, or put up banners expressing condolences. A black ribbon was also superimposed over the logo of [[Latvijas Televīzija]] during their broadcasts, and was worn by [[anchorman|anchormen]] and anchorwomen. Latvijas Televīzija and other television channels and news website Delfi decided to suspend all commercials from broadcast for the following three days.

Maxima, the owner of the store, ordered all its stores in the Baltic States to observe a period of mourning for three days during which Christmas decorations would not be lit and music would not be played. It also stopped all its advertising.&lt;ref name="Lithuanian delfi"/&gt; Many Latvians were upset that Maxima commercials were still being broadcast on Thursday evening and Friday morning despite the tragedy.

Heeding the call by local hospitals for blood donors, prospective donors waited in a long line at the State Blood Donor Centre on the Friday morning and, after about an hour, the centre thanked donors on Twitter for the overwhelming response and that it had met its collection goals.

A charity drive to help the injured and families of victims was started, which ran for about a month collecting 948263.46 [[Latvian lats|lats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ziedot.lv/lv/project/1762|title=Atbalsts 21. novembra traģēdijā cietušajiem|publisher=ziedot.lv|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sports and cultural events, including the ''Spēlmaņu nakts'' annual acting award ceremony, set to take place in the days following the tragedy, were cancelled. The Latvian Minister of Culture, [[Dace Melbārde]], called for cultural organisations, including art and music schools, to consider carefully what events would be appropriate in the circumstances.&lt;ref name="spelmanu nakts"/&gt;

In almost all Latvian embassies, people were allowed to write their names in condolence books. The Latvian Lutheran and Russian Orthodox church organisations urged people to pray for the victims of the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |location=Latvia |url= http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/criminal/cerkov-skorbit-po-pogibshim-v-rezultate-tragedii-v-maxima.d?id=43837584 |title=Церковь скорбит по погибшим в результате трагедии в Maxima |language=Russian |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=22 November 2013 |publisher=DELFI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives of Maxima Latvia expressed condolences to the families of the deceased. After an emergency meeting, the board of Maxima promised that inspections would be carried out on all Maxima stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MAXIMA проведёт проверку всех магазинов сети, компенсации получат все |language=Russian |location=Latvia |publisher=FOCUS |date=22 November 2013 |url= http://ru.focus.lv/biznes/kompanii/maxima-provedet-proverku-vseh-magazinov-seti-kompensacii-poluchat-vse |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
