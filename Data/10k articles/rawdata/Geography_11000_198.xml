The '''5th parallel south''' is a [[circle of latitude]] that is 5 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] [[south]] of the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[equator|equatorial plane]]. It crosses the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Africa]], the [[Indian Ocean]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Australasia]], the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[South America]].

==Around the world==
Starting at the [[Prime Meridian]] and heading eastwards, the parallel 5° south passes through:

The '''A15''' is a major [[road]] in [[England]]. It runs north from [[Peterborough]] via [[Market Deeping]], [[Bourne, Lincolnshire|Bourne]], [[Sleaford]] and [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] along a variety of ancient, Roman, and Turnpike alignments before it is interrupted at its junction with the [[M180 motorway|M180]] near [[Scawby]]. The road restarts {{convert|10|mi}} east, and then continues north past [[Barton-upon-Humber]], crossing the [[Humber]] on the [[Humber Bridge]] before terminating at [[Hessle]] near [[Kingston upon Hull]].

==Driving conditions==
According to [[The Automobile Association|the AA]], the route is {{convert|95|mi|km}} long, and should take 2{{fraction|1|4}} hours. Norman Cross – Bourne takes 33 minutes, Bourne to Lincoln takes 46 minutes and Lincoln to the Humber Bridge takes 54 minutes.

A section of the A15 (between [[Scampton]] and the M180) provides the longest stretch of straight road in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freestone|first1=Nigel|title=Ultimate British Roads and Motorways Quiz Book : 200 Questions on Road and Motorway History|date=2013|publisher=Andrews UK|isbn=9781909949805|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hucker|first1=Richard Adrian|title=How Did the Romans Achieve Straight Roads?|url=https://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig2009/papers/hs01/hs01_hucker_3471.pdf|website=Fig.net|accessdate=14 June 2016|page=1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A15 Peterborough (City Centre) Dec 2012.jpg|thumb|left|The A15 dual carrigeway in the city centre.]]
The A15 is Peterborough's main connecting road from the south to the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1(M)]], joining&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/885179 |title=Cycle Route|work=OS grid TL1690|publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Stilton]], at [[Norman Cross]]. It begins as ''London Road'' at junction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/885202 |title=Brick Patterns, Norman Cross|work=OS grid TL1590|publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16 of the A1(M) with the B1043 (former A1) in [[Cambridgeshire]] and the district of [[North West Cambridgeshire]]. From here to [[Yaxley, Cambridgeshire|Yaxley]] it passes the ''Norman Cross Hotel''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/885173 |title=Norman Cross Hotel|work=OS grid TL1590|publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and follows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/379714 |title=London Road Yaxley|work=OS grid TL1792|publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the City of Peterborough and Cambridgeshire boundary, where there is a junction with the B1091 (for [[Farcet]]).

It enters the City of Peterborough near [[Hampton, Peterborough|Hampton Vale]] on the left, and meets the A1260 ''The Serpentine'', which leads to two much faster routes around Peterborough. Next is a roundabout for the Cygnet Park business park on the left, home of the new headquarters of [[News International]]. It enters [[Old Fletton]] near the headquarters of [[Hotpoint]] to the left. There is a staggered junction with the A1129 and it crosses the [[East Coast Main Line]]. It passes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/83410 |title=London Road, Peterborough|work=OS grid TL1997|publisher=Geograph project |date=23 November 2005 |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] on the right in [[New Fletton]]. It meets the start of the [[A605 road|A605]] at a roundabout and crosses the [[River Nene]].

[[File:15 Meets 47 - geograph.org.uk - 322311.jpg|thumb|The [[A47 road|A47]] junction near [[Dogsthorpe, Peterborough|Dogsthorpe]] ]]
The A15 takes two routes through Peterborough:
* The route on the west side begins as ''Bourges Boulevard''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/465153 |title=Covered footbridge across Bourges Boulevard|work=OS grid TL1898|publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Peterborough [[Crown Court]], meets the A1179 (former A47), passes the [[Peterborough railway station]] and meets three roundabouts near [[Millfield, Peterborough|Millfield]] and [[New England, Peterborough|New England]]. It follows the East Coast Main Line and becomes ''Lincoln Road'' and ''Werrington Parkway''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/672644 |title=Pedestrian crossing|work=OS grid TF1504|publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the A47 [[Grade separation|GSJ]]. It passes four roundabouts, crossing the [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line]].
* The route on the east side starts at the ''[[Eye, Cambridgeshire|Eye]]'' roundabout&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/354159 |title=Eye roundabout, Peterborough|work=OS grid TF2101|publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the A1139 at [[Newark, Peterborough|Newark]], then follows the dual-carriageway ''Paston Parkway'', which meets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/322311 |title=15 Meets 47|work=OS grid TF2002|publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the A47. It continues as a dual-carriageway (opened in spring 2008) at the next roundabout at [[Gunthorpe, Peterborough|Gunthorpe]] and follows the [[Car Dyke]] then meets another roundabout at Werrington before becoming a single carriageway and crosses the Spalding railway between [[Werrington, Peterborough|Werrington]] and [[Glinton, Cambridgeshire|Glinton]] .

[[File:Pedestrian crossing - geograph.org.uk - 672644.jpg|thumb|Approaching the [[Glinton, Cambridgeshire|Glinton]] bypass from the south]]
Both routes head through [[Werrington, Peterborough|Werrington]] (passing either side) before joining again at [[Glinton, Cambridgeshire|Glinton]] with the roundabout with the B1443. There is another roundabout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/162377 |title=Glinton Bypass|work=OS grid TF1405|publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the B1443 (for [[Helpston]]). It passes [[Etton, Cambridgeshire|Etton]] and meets a roundabout with the  B1524&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/442601 |title=The B1524, Lincoln Road|work=OS grid TF1408|publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (former route through Market Deeping), B1162 (for [[Northborough, Cambridgeshire|Northborough]] to the right) and an exit for [[Maxey, Cambridgeshire|Maxey]] to the right.

===Kesteven===
Just south of the ''Welland Gate'' roundabout on the [[A1175 road|A1175]] and B1166, it crosses the [[River Welland]] so entering [[South Kesteven]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. The roundabout marks the western end of the £7&amp;nbsp;million {{convert|4|mi|adj=on}} [[Market Deeping]] bypass, finished in July 1998. The A15 and A1175 roads are now merged in a {{convert|1|mi|adj=on}} dual-carriageway stretch. It meets the B1524 (former route) at a roundabout and heads to the left as ''Peterborough Road''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/453491 |title=becoming |publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bourne Road'' and ''Deeping Road''.

[[File:The A15 Peterborough Road, Langtoft, Lincs - geograph.org.uk - 453491.jpg|thumb|Entering [[Langtoft, Lincolnshire|Langtoft]] from the south]]
North of Baston is the Waterside Garden Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.begardenhappy.com/watersidegardencentre |title=Garden Centre Peterborough &amp;#124; Waterside Garden Centre |publisher=BeGardenHappy | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; close to where it meets the north-south [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman Road]] [[King Street (Roman road)|King Street]], which it follows until just north of Bourne. It goes over the [[River Glen, Lincolnshire|River Glen]] at the point it is crossed by the [[Macmillan Way]], at [[Kate's Bridge]].

At the B1206 crossroads, the old route used to go through [[Hibaldstow]] and [[Brigg]], with the former road to [[Redbourne]] now a cycle route. It passes close to [[Kirton in Lindsey]], home of [[RAF Kirton in Lindsey]] much used in the [[Second World War]] as a [[Battle of Britain airfields|fighter airfield]] in [[No. 12 Group RAF|12 Group]], now home to the [[Trent Valley Gliding Club]].

This section was the upgraded route of an unclassified road. It crosses the [[Sheffield to Lincoln Line|Sheffield to Cleethorpes railway line]] near the deserted village of [[Gainsthorpe]], passes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/234368 |title=A15 near Scawby|work=OS grid SE9505|publisher=Geograph project |date=6 September 2006 |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; near to [[Scawby]], and joining&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/327474 |title=M180 west towards junction 4|work=OS grid SE9606|publisher=Geograph project | accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[M180 motorway|M180]] at junction 4, near [[Scunthorpe]].

Ermine Street continues north as the B1207, meeting the Humber near [[Winteringham]].

The route of the A15 now becomes part of the three-laned M180, which was opened on 2 September 1977. The A15 section along Ermine Street was planned to be opened at the same time, but it had to wait twelve years. The buildup of traffic to Grimsby prompted calls for the Brigg bypass for many years, but the [[Flixborough disaster|Flixborough explosion]] of 1974 made it more of an emergency. This section goes under the [[A18 road (Great Britain)|A18]], over the [[River Ancholme]], over the old route of the A15 (B1206) and over the [[South TransPennine|South Trans-Pennine]] railway. At junction 5, the A15 reforms at the dual-grade ''Barnetby Top Interchange'', which is crossed by the [[Viking Way]] and has an exit to [[Elsham, Lincolnshire|Elsham]]. It continues north as a dual carriageway which carries about as little traffic as the M180. The M180 drops to two lanes under this roundabout and continues to [[Grimsby]] and [[Immingham]] as the A180.

The A15 towards the [[Humber Bridge]], goes directly across the runways of the former [[RAF Bomber Command]] airfield at [[RAF Elsham Wolds]] (where over 1000 of its aircrew were killed), which is now the Elsham Wolds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/211562 |title=Elsham Wolds - Old Hangar|work=OS grid TA0413|publisher=Geograph project |date=30 July 2006 |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial Estate.

The '''Abtswoudse Bos''' is man-made park and land art project, opened in 2000, of about 190 ha. It lies south of the [[Tanthof]] neighbourhood in [[Delft]], east of [[Schipluiden]] and north of [[Overschie]].

The Abtswoudse Bos is situated in a [[polder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hofvandelfland.nl/node/437 | title=Het Abtswoudse bos|website=Hofvandelfland.nl| date=2014-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has trees, bushes, footpaths, cycling roads, ditches, lakes, and small ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://recreatie.middendelfland.net/gebieden/abtswoudsebos.htm | title=Abtswoudse Bos|website=Recreatie.middendelfland.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area's waters contain many [[aquatic plants]], like reeds, underwater plants, and floating plants. The polder used to consists of meadows.

== Mother Earth ==

Around this hill is a meadow with planted ashes. In the center of Mother Earth is a circular pond. Bushes with berries have been planted on the arms and legs. The knees, hands, and feet have stayed open The footpaths on the hill are meant to resemble blood veins.

{{wikiquote|Rome}}
"'''All Roads Lead to Rome'''" is the modern reading of a medieval statement, apparently originally a reference to [[Roman roads]] generally and the [[Milliarium Aureum]] (Golden Milestone) specifically.&lt;ref&gt;Schaaf, P. (1867/1886). Ante-Nicene fathers: The Apostolic fathers, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus [Roberts, A. &amp; Donaldson, J, Eds]. [Electronic reprint] Grand Rapids, MI, USA: CCEL, v.1 p.1&lt;/ref&gt; As a proverb, it refers to the fact that many routes can lead to a given result.

The phrase can refer to:
* A proverb in a number of languages referring to [[Roman roads]] and the [[Milliarium Aureum]].
* "All Roads Lead to Rome", second episode of the 1965 ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[The Romans (Doctor Who)#ep2|The Romans]]''
* [[All Roads Lead to Rome (film)|''All Roads Lead to Rome'' (film)]], a 2015 American romantic comedy film
* "All Roads Lead to Rome", a song on [[Feline_(The_Stranglers_album)|''Feline'' (The Stranglers album)]]

== Definitions and variable geometry ==
[[File:Anglosphere Geometry.svg|thumb|400px|Variable geometry of the Anglosphere, according to James Bennett (''The Anglosphere Challenge'')]]

The term ''Anglosphere'' was first coined, but not explicitly defined, by the science fiction writer [[Neal Stephenson]] in his book ''[[The Diamond Age]]'', published in 1995.&lt;ref name="wordspy" /&gt; John Lloyd adopted the term in 2000 and defined it as including the United States and the United Kingdom along with English-speaking Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa and the [[British West Indies]].{{sfn|Lloyd|2000}} The [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster]] dictionary defines the Anglosphere as "the countries of the world in which the English language and cultural values predominate".{{sfn|Merriam-Webster Staff|2010|loc=''Anglosphere''}}{{efn|"the group of countries where [[English language|English]] is the main native language"({{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}).}}

The five main countries in the Anglosphere (the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom) maintain a close affinity of cultural, diplomatic and military links with one another. All are aligned under such programs as:
*The [[UKUSA Agreement]] (signals intelligence),
*[[Five Eyes]] (intelligence),
*[[Combined Communications Electronics Board]] (communications electronics),
*[[The Technical Cooperation Program]] (technology and science),
*[[Air and Space Interoperability Council]] (air forces),

Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom retain [[Elizabeth II]] as [[head of state]], form part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and use of the [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary system]] of government. In the wake of the [[Brexit|United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union]] as a result of a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum held in 2016]], there has been mounting political and popular support for a loose free travel and common market area to be formed between them known as [[CANZUK]].&lt;ref name="ipol2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thercs.org/assets/Press-Releases/UK-polling-release-embargoed-13.03.16-1.pdf|title=UK public strongly backs freedom to live and work in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canzukinternational.com/2017/04/significant-support-for-canzuk-free.html|title=Survey Reveals Support For CANZUK Free Movement|website=CANZUK International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==
The American businessman [[James C. Bennett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/28/uselections2004.usa4|title=Explaining the 'Anglosphere'|first=Glenn|last=Reynolds|date=28 October 2004|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; a proponent of the idea that there is something special about the cultural and legal traditions of English-speaking nations, writes in his 2004 book ''The Anglosphere Challenge'':

{{quote|The Anglosphere, as a network civilization without a corresponding political form, has necessarily imprecise boundaries. Geographically, the densest nodes of the Anglosphere are found in the United States and the United Kingdom. English-speaking Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and English-speaking South Africa (who constitute a very small minority in that country) are also significant populations. The English-speaking Caribbean, English-speaking [[Oceania]] and the English-speaking educated populations in Africa and India constitute other important nodes.|James C. Bennett.{{sfn|Bennett|2004||p=80}}}}

Bennett argues that there are two challenges confronting his concept of the Anglosphere. The first is finding ways to cope with rapid technological advancement and the second is the geopolitical challenges created by what he assumes will be an increasing gap between anglophone prosperity and economic struggles elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|2004|loc=}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] claims that the Anglosphere has been central in the [[First World War]], [[Second World War]] and [[Cold War]]. He goes on to contend that anglophone unity is necessary for the defeat of [[Islamism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|2006|loc=}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2003 profile in ''[[The Guardian]]'', historian [[Robert Conquest]] favoured a British withdrawal from the [[European Union]] in favour of creating "a much looser association of English-speaking nations, known as the 'Anglosphere'".{{sfn|Brown|2003}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2015/12/10/anglosphere-is-the-other-side-of-the-eurosceptic-coin-a-conception-of-britains-identity-and-place-in-the-world/|title=The power of the Anglosphere in Eurosceptical thought|date=10 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand historian [[James Belich (historian)|James Belich]] connected patterns of growth in the industrialisation of the United States and the United Kingdom with former [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]];{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} New Zealand, Australia, Canada and South Africa, and more loosely to growth in former UK constituent country Ireland, as well as British-allied [[Argentina]], during the 19th and early to mid-20th century, in his book ''Replenishing the Earth''. He used the term "Anglo-World" to refer to the US, UK and former Dominions, arguing that the experience and present reality of former British colonies like [[India]], [[Kenya]], and [[Jamaica]] differ in substantial and important ways from this core group of countries.

==Criticisms==
In 2000, [[Michael Ignatieff]] wrote in an exchange with [[Robert Conquest]], published by the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', that the term neglects the evolution of fundamental legal and cultural differences between the US and the UK, and the ways in which UK and European norms have been drawn closer together during Britain's membership in the EU through regulatory harmonisation. Of Conquest's view of the Anglosphere, Ignatieff writes: "He seems to believe that Britain should either [[Brexit|withdraw from Europe]] or refuse all further measures of cooperation, which would jeopardize Europe's real achievements. He wants Britain to throw in its lot with a union of English-speaking peoples, and I believe this to be a romantic illusion".{{sfn|Conquest|Reply by Ignatieff|2000}}

In 2016, [[Nick Cohen]] wrote in an article titled "It’s a Eurosceptic fantasy that the ‘Anglosphere’ wants Brexit" for ''[[The Spectator]]''’s Coffee House blog: "‘Anglosphere’ is just the right's [[Political correctness|PC]] replacement for what we used to call in blunter times ‘the white Commonwealth’."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/its-a-eurosceptic-fantasy-that-the-anglosphere-wants-brexit/|title=It’s a Eurosceptic fantasy that the ‘Anglosphere’ wants Brexit - Coffee House|date=12 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated this criticism in another article for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/14/brexit-britain-out-of-options-humiliation-painful|title=Brexit Britain is out of options. Our humiliation is painful to watch - Nick Cohen|first=Nick|last=Cohen|date=14 July 2018|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticism was presented by other critics such as Canadian academic Srđan Vučetić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2017/02/24/canzuk-conservatives-and-canada-marching-backward-to-empire/|title=CANZUK, Conservatives and Canada: Marching backward to empire - iPolitics|date=24 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opencanada.org/features/canada-and-anglo-world-where-do-we-stand/|title=Canada and the Anglo World – where do we stand?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160613/jsp/opinion/story_90833.jsp|title=Speaking in tongues|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, amidst the aftermath of the [[Brexit referendum]], two British professors of public policy [[Michael Kenny (political scientist)|Michael Kenny]] and Nick Pearce published a critical scholarly monograph titled ''Shadows of Empire: The Anglosphere in British Politics'' ({{ISBN|978-1509516612}}). In one of a series of accompanying opinion pieces, they questioned:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/opinion/donald-trump-uk-visit-anglosphere-brexit.html|title=Opinion – Britain, Time to Let Go of the ‘Anglosphere’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The tragedy of the different national orientations that have emerged in British politics after empire—whether pro-European, Anglo-American, Anglospheric or some combination of these—is that none of them has yet been the compelling, coherent and popular answer to the country’s most important question: How should Britain find its way in the wider, modern world?}}

They stated in another article:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukandeu.ac.uk/in-the-shadows-of-empire-how-the-anglosphere-dream-lives-on/|title=In the shadows of empire: how the Anglosphere dream lives on – UK in a changing Europe|date=11 May 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Meanwhile, the other core English-speaking countries to which the Anglosphere refers, show no serious inclination to join the UK in forging new political and economic alliances. They will, most likely, continue to work within existing regional and international institutions and remain indifferent to – or simply perplexed by – calls for some kind of formalised Anglosphere alliance.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5125">A '''Bioeffector'''  is a viable [[microorganism]] or active natural compound which directly or indirectly affects plant performance ([[Biofertilizer]]), and thus has the potential to reduce [[fertilizer]] and [[pesticide]] use in crop production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpg.phytomedizin.org/fileadmin/tagungen/03_PPPHE/Doku/2014/MinutesPPPHE2014.pdf Minutes of the 6th International Symposium Plant Protection and Plant Health in Europe, May 2014 Braunschweig, Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Bioeffectors have a direct or indirect effect on plant performance by influencing the functional implementation or activation of biological mechanisms, particularly those interfering with soil-plant-microbe interactions.&lt;ref&gt;V. Römheld, G. Neumann (2006): ''The Rhizosphere: Contributions of the soil-root interface to sustainable soil systems''. In: N. Uphoff, N., N. A. S. Ball et al. (Hg.), ''Biological Approaches to Sustainable Soil Systems'', S. 92–107, CRC-Press, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast to conventional fertilizers and pesticides, the effectiveness of bioeffectors is not based on a substantial direct input of mineral plant nutrients, either in inorganic or organic forms.

*Products in use are:
** Microbial residues,
** Composting and fermentation products,
** Plant and algae extracts
*Bioeffector-preparations (''bio-agents'') as ready-formulated products are applied:
** with the purpose of stimulating plant growth (bio-stimulants),
** to improve plant nutrient acquisition (bio-fertilizers),
** to protect plants from [[pathogens]] and [[Pest (organism)|pests]] ([[Biological pest control|bio-control agents]])
** or generally to advance cropping efficiency; they can contain one or more bio-effectors along with other substances”&lt;ref&gt;Bakonyi N., Donath S., Weinmann M., Neumann G., [[Torsten Müller (agroscientist)|Müller T.]], [[Volker Roemheld|Römheld V.]] (2008): Assessing commercial bio-fertilisers for improved phoshorus availability. Use of rapid screening tests. Jahrestagung der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Pflanzenernährung 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*Well established bioeffectors with documented positive results in the field level are:
** [[Rhizobia]] strains for soil or seed inoculation as a prerequisite for symbiotic N2-fixation when establishing new legume species or varieties.
** positive effects of [[mycorrhiza]] inoculation for soils with a (temporarily) low potential for natural root mycorrhization.
** sufficient mycorrhization enhances nutrient (P) and water uptake and increases resistance to pathogenic fungi.
*Further mechanisms for the positive impact of bioeffectors on plant growth have postulated, promising a high potential for resource preservation due to reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use:
** Active nutrient mobilisation by exudation of acids and carboxylates (e.g. P-mobilisation),
** exudation of micro-nutrient mobilising siderophores/chelates (e.g. Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;),
** reduction of trace elements from less soluble oxidised to highly soluble reduced forms (e.g. Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; to Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;),
** associative/non-symbiotic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixation, protective antagonism to plant pathogens,
** enhancement of mycorrhizal infection and growth, and stimulating hormonal effects.

== Research and Public Dissemination ==
Under the Acronym ''Biofector'' the European Union supports the Research of Bioeffectors under the leadership of the [[University of Hohenheim]] (Coordinator [[Guenter Neumann (agricultural scientist)|Guenter Neumann]]).
The results of the project will be evaluated by the members of the [[Association Biostimulants in Agriculture]] (ABISTA) and provided agriculture for use and EU institutions for the legislative and registration procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biostimulants.info/ Webpage Biostimulants Association]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other Biostimulants Organisations are [[European Biostimulant Industry Council]], [[International Biocontrol Manufacturers' Association]] and [[Annual Biocontrol Industry Meeting]].

[[File:Seversk checkpoint.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Central entry checkpoint to the closed city of [[Seversk]], Tomsk Oblast, Russia]]

A '''closed city''' or '''closed town''' is a settlement where travel or residency restrictions are applied so that specific authorization is required to visit or remain overnight. They may be sensitive military establishments or secret research installations which require much more space or freedom than is available in a conventional [[military base]]. There may also be a wider variety of permanent residents including close family members of workers or trusted traders who are not directly connected with its [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] purposes.

Many closed cities existed in the [[Soviet Union]]. After 1991, a number of them still existed in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries, especially [[Russia]]. In modern Russia, such places are officially known as "closed administrative-territorial formations" ({{lang|ru|закрытые административно-территориальные образования}}, ''zakrytye administrativno-territorial'nye obrazovaniya'', or {{lang|ru|ЗАТО}} ''ZATO'' for short).

==Structure and operations==
[[File:Checkpoint in closed city Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai.jpg|thumb|A checkpoint in the closed city of [[Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Zheleznogorsk]], in [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], [[Russia]]]]

Sometimes closed cities may only be represented on [[Classified information|classified]] maps which are not available to the general public. In some cases there may be no road signs or directions to closed cities, and they are usually omitted from railroad time tables and bus routes.

Sometimes closed cities may be indicated obliquely as a nearby insignificant village, with the name of the stop serving the closed city made equivocal or misleading. For mail delivery, a closed city is usually named as the nearest large city and a special [[postcode]] e.g. Arzamas‑16, Chelyabinsk‑65. The actual settlement can be rather distant from its namesakes; for instance, [[Sarov]], designated Arzamas-16, is in the federal republic of [[Mordovia]], whereas [[Arzamas]] is in the [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]] (roughly {{convert|75|km}} away). People not living in a closed city were subject to document checks and [[security checkpoint]]s, and explicit permission was required for them to visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photo-escape.ru/photo/backups/sarov-border/|title=City border|work=Photoarchives|publisher=FOTOESCAPE|accessdate =2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; To relocate to a closed city, one would need security clearance by the organization running it, such as the [[KGB]] in Soviet closed cities.

Closed cities were sometimes guarded by a security perimeter with [[barbed wire]] and [[Watchtower|towers]]. The very fact of such a city's existence was often classified, and residents were expected not to divulge their place of residence to outsiders. This lack of freedom was often compensated by better housing conditions and a better choice of goods in retail trade than elsewhere in the country. Also, in the Soviet Union, people working with classified information received a [[Bonus payment|salary bonus]].

==Soviet Union closed cities==
[[File:Map of Russia - Oblasts with Atomgrads.svg|thumb|300px|Map indicating federal subjects containing closed cities used for nuclear research and development]]

Closed cities were established in the [[Soviet Union]] from the late 1940s onwards under the euphemistic name of "post boxes", referring to the practice of addressing post to them via mail boxes in other cities. They fell into two distinct categories.

# The first category comprised relatively small communities with sensitive military, industrial, or scientific facilities, such as arms plants or [[nuclear research]] sites.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/secret-cities.htm "Secret Cities".] [http://www.globalsecurity.org GlobalSecurity.org]. Accessed August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the modern towns of [[Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast|Ozyorsk]] ([[Chelyabinsk]]-65) with a [[plutonium]] production plant, and [[Sillamäe]], the site of a [[uranium enrichment]] facility. Even Soviet [[citizen]]s were not allowed access to these places without proper authorization. In addition to this, some bigger cities were closed for unauthorized access to foreigners, while they were freely accessible to Soviet citizens. These included cities like [[Perm]], a center for Soviet [[tank]] production, and [[Vladivostok]], the headquarters and primary base of the [[Soviet Pacific Fleet]].
# The second category consisted of border cities (and some whole border areas, such as the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Saaremaa]], and [[Hiiumaa]]) which were closed for security purposes. Comparable closed areas existed elsewhere in the [[Eastern bloc]]; a substantial area along the [[inner German border]] and the border between [[West Germany]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] was placed under similar restrictions (although by the 1970s foreigners could cross the latter by train). Citizens were required to have special permits to enter such areas.

The locations of the first category of the closed cities were chosen for their geographical characteristics. They were often established in remote places situated deep in the [[Urals]] and [[Siberia]], out of reach of enemy bombers. They were built close to rivers and lakes which were used to provide the large amounts of water needed for heavy industry and nuclear technology. Existing civilian settlements in the vicinity were often used as sources of construction labour. Although the closure of cities originated as a strictly temporary measure which was to be normalized under more favorable conditions, in practice the closed cities took on a life of their own and became a notable institutional feature of the Soviet system.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Zaslavsky, "Ethnic group divided: social stratification and nationality policy in the Soviet Union", p. 224, in Peter Joseph Potichnyj, ''The Soviet Union: Party and Society'', Cambridge University Press, 1988. {{ISBN|0-521-34460-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Movement to and from closed areas was tightly controlled. Foreigners were prohibited from entering them and local citizens were under stringent restrictions. They had to have special permission to travel there or leave, and anyone seeking residency was required to undergo vetting by the [[NKVD]] and its successor agencies. Access to some closed cities was physically enforced by surrounding them with [[barbed wire]] fences monitored by armed guards.

===The "box"===
"Box" was the unofficial name of a secret Soviet facility much like the closed city, but smaller, usually the size of a [[factory]]. The "box" name was usually classified, as were the activities there. Incoming [[mail]] was addressed to "mailbox #XXXX", thus the name of "box". Most Soviet design bureaus for [[weapon]]s, [[aircraft]], space, [[military]] [[electronics]], etc. were "boxes".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Closed cities in post-Soviet states==
===Russia===
[[File:Severomorsk (5145531991).jpg|thumb|A view of [[Severomorsk]], Murmansk Oblast, Russia]]

Russia has the largest number of closed cities. The policy of closing cities underwent major changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some cities, such as [[Perm]], were opened well before the fall of the Soviet Union; others, such as [[Kaliningrad]] and [[Vladivostok]], remained closed until as late as 1992. The adoption of a new constitution for the Russian Federation in 1993 prompted significant reforms to the status of closed cities, which were renamed "closed administrative-territorial formations" (or ZATO, after the Russian acronym). [[Subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|Municipally]] all such entities have a status of urban [[okrug]]s, as mandated by the federal law.

There are currently 44 publicly acknowledged closed cities in Russia with a total population of about 1.5 million people. 75% are administered by the [[Defence Ministry of the Russian Federation|Russian Ministry of Defense]], with the rest being administered by [[Rosatom]].&lt;ref name="edelstein"&gt;Nadezhda Kutepova &amp; Olga Tsepilova, "A short history of the ZATO", pp. 148–149, in ''Cultures of Contamination, Volume 14: Legacies of Pollution in Russia and the US'' (Research in Social Problems and Public Policy), editors Michael Edelstein, Maria Tysiachniouk, Lyudmila V. Smirnova. JAI Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-7623-1371-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 15 or so closed cities are believed to exist, but their names and locations have not been publicly disclosed by the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]].&lt;ref name="kaser"&gt;Greg Kaser, "Motivation and Redirection: Rationale and Achievements in the Russian Closed Nuclear Cities", p. 3, in ''Countering Nuclear and Radiological Terrorism'', editors David J. Diamond, Samuel Apikyan, Greg Kaser. Springer, 2006. {{ISBN|1-4020-4897-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Russian closed cities are open for foreign [[investment]], but foreigners may only enter with a [[license|permit]]. An example is the [[Nuclear Cities Initiative]] (NCI), a joint effort of the [[United States]] [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] and Minatom, which involves in part the cities of Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Zheleznogorsk.

The number of closed cities has been significantly reduced since the mid-1990s. However, on 30 October 2001, foreign travel (without any exceptions) was restricted in the northern cities of [[Norilsk]], [[Talnakh]], [[Kayerkan]], [[Dudinka]], and [[Igarka]]. Russian and Belarusian citizens visiting these cities are not required to have any permits, however, local courts are known to deport Belarusian citizens&lt;ref&gt;[http://ru-antivisa.livejournal.com/351602.html]&lt;/ref&gt; in contradiction with federal Constitution.

====Travel restrictions for foreigners====
There is a list of territories within Russia that do not have closed city status, but require special permits for foreigners to visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://base.garant.ru/104408/|title=Постановление Правительства РФ от 4 июля 1992 г.

===Azerbaijan===
*[[Agdam District]], [[Azerbaijan]]

===Estonia===
There were two closed cities in [[Estonia]]: [[Sillamäe]] and [[Paldiski]]. As with all the other industrial cities, the population of them was mainly Russian-speaking. Sillamäe was the site for a chemical factory that produced [[fuel rod]]s and nuclear materials for the Soviet [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear weapon]] facilities, while Paldiski was home to a [[Soviet Navy]] [[nuclear submarine]] training centre. Sillamäe was closed until Estonia regained its independence in 1991; Paldiski remained closed until 1994, when the last Russian warship left.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[Tartu]], home to [[Raadi Airfield]], was partially closed. Foreign academics could visit the [[University of Tartu]], but had to sleep elsewhere.

===Kazakhstan===
[[File:Baikonuriss.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of [[Baikonur]], Kazakhstan]]

*[[Baikonur]], a town close to the spaceport facility of the same name in [[Kazakhstan]], which is rented and administered by Russia. Non-resident visitors will need pre-approval from the Russian authorities to visit both the town of Baikonur itself and the Cosmodrome. Note that said approval is completely separate from just having a Russian visa. Some tourism organisations in Kazakhstan provide services in organising trips to visit Baikonur and the museums contained there.

===Moldova===
Moldova has one official closed city – the commune [[Cobasna]] ([[Rîbnița District]]) in the disputed area of [[Transnistria]]. The commune, located on the left bank of the [[Dniester]] river, still contains military warehouses of the former Soviet [[14th Army (Soviet Union)|14th Army]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Ukraine===
[[Ukraine]] had eighteen closed cities: among them the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimean]] port of [[Sevastopol]] and the industrial city of [[Dnipropetrovsk]], though both were restricted to foreigners, not locals. Travel restrictions were lifted in the mid-1990s.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The '''Maps and the Internet Commission of the International Cartographic Association''' (or simply ''Maps and the Internet Commission'') was created in 1999 as one of the standing commissions of the [[International Cartographic Association]]. It promotes multi-national cartographic research in order to solve problems related to [[Web mapping|web-based cartography]]. The commission enhances cartographic education related to the Internet. In addition, the commission promotes professional and technical standards for maps available through the Internet.

Like all commissions of the International Cartographic Association, formal members are assigned by individual countries. However, anyone can become a corresponding member. Corresponding members receive all commission correspondence and invitations to meetings. Activities of the commission include e-mails to members, meetings, workshops, promotion of standards, and publications.

==Commission background==
The Internet has redefined how maps are used (see [[Web mapping]]). No longer restricted to paper, maps are transmitted almost instantly and delivered to the user in a fraction of the time required to distribute maps on paper. They are viewed in a more timely fashion. Some maps, such as those showing weather patterns, are updated continuously throughout the day. It is the interactive nature of the Internet map that is considered the most important development. Online maps are accessed through a hyperlinking structure that makes it possible to engage the map user on a higher-level than is possible with a map on paper.The Internet is making it possible to more easily distribute cartographic displays such as map animations. The Internet presents the map user with both a faster method of map distribution and different forms of mapping.

==Commission Terms of Reference==
* Focus attention on disseminating maps and spatial data through distributed electronic networks. Product: Journal articles and web pages.
* Examine Internet map usage to better serve user needs. Product: Oral or published report.
* Examine the use of new Internet mapping technologies for social interaction and empowerment with online maps. Product: Oral or published report.
* Examine differences in the application of Internet maps between countries. Product: Oral or published report.
* Examine the potential of Internet map metadata. Product: Oral or published report.
* Promote the exchange of information about effective Internet mapping for an international audience. Collaboration / coordination with the ICA commission on visualization and virtual environments. Product: Workshop(s) and web pages.
* Promote instruction on Internet mapping through collaboration / coordination with agencies for research and mapping. Product: Materials to be used in workshops.

==Research Questions==
Broader research questions associated with the commission:
* Determine the extent and type of Internet map usage. It is difficult to determine the number of maps that are distributed through the web. This effort could culminate in a  'map counter' that would estimate the number of maps that have been so distributed, on a regular basis.
* How are maps being used? Research is needed that examines the users in order to determine how cartographers can better serve their needs. 
* Promote international user interfaces for maps on the web. This would involve developing an iconic vocabulary of map symbols that are simple and clear, and a consistent color vocabulary.
* Promote the creation of international web map servers. International web map servers would distributed maps that could be used by an international audience.
* Develop a database of web maps with specific themes or authors, areas (coordinates), resolution, dates, etc. A large number of maps reside on the web but it is difficult to find them, and particularly to find anything out about them. Maps on the web should be accompanied by a metafile with a description of the contents (e.g. map, soils, Netherlands, 1987, in a standardized format like MARC 2). The metafiles would be aggregated into a database that would point to map files available on the web without having to go to each home page.
* Develop guidelines for the design of web maps. Initially this might focus on the relatively common static maps, and perhaps offer some suggestions about fonts, colors, avoiding things that retard downloading, etc.
* Develop instructional materials (syllabi, topics, exercises, project websites, etc.) for Internet cartography. Many instructional materials are already available on the web. This effort would involve making these materials available from a central source.
* Collaborative map use through the web. How can maps delivered through the Internet be used by groups of people in collaborative problem-solving.
* Delivering cartographic data and services through the Internet. Cartographic data sets are huge, and the distributed processing times are not compatible with the computational complexity of our cartographic modeling operations. Methods need to be found to distribute cartographic data more efficiently.

'''Deep-sea exploration''' is the investigation of physical, [[chemical]], and [[biological]] conditions on the [[sea bed]], for [[scientific]] or [[Commerce|commercial]] purposes. Deep-sea [[exploration]] is considered as a relatively recent human activity compared to the other areas of [[geophysical]] research, as the depths of the sea have been investigated only during comparatively recent years. The ocean depths still remain as a largely unexplored part of the [[Earth|planet]], and form a relatively undiscovered domain.

In general, modern scientific [[Deep sea|Deep-sea]] exploration can be said to have begun when [[France|French]] scientist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] investigated the average depth of the [[Atlantic ocean]] by observing tidal motions registered on [[Brazil]]ian and [[Africa]]n coasts. He calculated the depth to be {{convert|3,962|m|ft|0}}, a value later proven quite accurate by soundings measurement.&lt;ref name="enotes2003"&gt;Deep Sea Exploration." World of Earth Science. Ed. K. Lee Lerner and Brenda Wilmoth Lerner. Gale Cengage, 2003. eNotes.com. 2006. 7 Dec, 2009 &lt;http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/deep-sea-exploration&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, with increasing demand for [[submarine cable]]s installment, accurate soundings was required and the first investigations of the sea bottom were undertaken. First deep-sea life forms were discovered in 1864 when [[Norway|Norwegian]] researchers obtained a sample of a stalked [[crinoid]] at a depth of {{convert|3,109|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. The [[British Government]] sent out the [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] (a ship called {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}}) in 1872 which discovered 715 new [[genera]] and 4,417 new [[species]] of marine organisms over the space of four years.&lt;ref name="enotes2003"/&gt;

The first instrument used for deep-sea investigation was the sounding weight, used by British explorer [[Sir James Clark Ross]].&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..de026100.a#FWNE.fw..de026100.a ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501194025/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..de026100.a#FWNE.fw..de026100.a |date=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this instrument, he reached a depth of {{convert|3,700|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=207274 |title=DEEP-SEA EXPLORATION (2009) |publisher=History.com |accessdate=8 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209114759/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=207274 |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Challenger'' expedition used similar instruments called Baillie sounding machines to extract samples from the sea bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/7094/Underwater-Exploration-Oceanography.html|title=Underwater Exploration - Oceanography|work=jrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, [[Jacques Piccard]] and [[United States Navy]] Lieutenant [[Don Walsh|Donald Walsh]] descended in the [[bathyscaphe]] [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|''Trieste'']] into the [[Mariana Trench]], the deepest part of the world's oceans, to make the deepest dive in history: {{convert|10,915|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jacques-piccard-oceanographer-and-pioneer-of-deepsea-exploration-992032.html |title=Jacques Piccard: Oceanographer and pioneer of deep-sea exploration - Obituaries, News |publisher=The Independent |date= 2008-11-05|accessdate=2010-09-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 25 March 2012, filmmaker [[James Cameron]] descended into the Mariana Trench and, for the first time, is expected to have filmed and sampled the bottom.&lt;ref name="NGS-20120325"&gt;{{cite web |last=Than |first=Ker |title=James Cameron Completes Record-Breaking Mariana Trench Dive |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-returns-science-sub/ |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20120325"&gt;{{cite news |last=Broad |first=William J. |title=Filmmaker in Submarine Voyages to Bottom of Sea |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/science/james-camerons-submarine-trip-to-challenger-deep.html |date=25 March 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC-20120325"&gt;{{cite web |author=AP Staff |title=James Cameron has reached deepest spot on Earth |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46850002/ns/technology_and_science-science |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-03/08/2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Broad |first=William J. |title=Miles Under the Pacific, a Director Will Take On His Most Risky Project |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/science/earth/james-cameron-prepares-to-dive-into-mariana-trench.html |date=8 March 2012 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=8 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGS-Deepseachallenge"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=DEEPSEA CHALLENGE – National Geographic Explorer James Cameron’s Expedition |url=http://deepseachallenge.com/ |date=7 March 2012 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=8 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625050833/http://deepseachallenge.com/ |archivedate=25 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1872 to 1876, a landmark ocean study was carried out by British scientists aboard HMS ''Challenger'', a sailing vessel that was redesigned into a laboratory ship. The ''Challenger'' expedition covered {{convert|127,653|km|nmi}}, and shipboard scientists collected hundreds of samples, hydrographic measurements, and specimens of marine life. They are also credited with providing the first real view of major seafloor features such as the deep ocean basins. They discovered more than 4,700 new species of marine life, including deep-sea organisms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/deepsea/level-2/tools/history.html |title=A Brief History |publisher=Ceoe.udel.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005020142/http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/deepsea/level-2/tools/history.html |archivedate=2010-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep-sea exploration advanced considerably in the 1900s thanks to a series of technological inventions, ranging from [[sonar]] system to detect the presence of objects underwater through the use of sound to manned deep-diving submersibles such as {{ship|DSV|Alvin}}. Operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], ''Alvin'' is designed to carry a crew of three people to depths of {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. The submarine is equipped with lights, cameras, computers, and highly maneuverable robotic arms for collecting samples in the darkness of the ocean's depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8422 |title=Human Occupied Vehicle Alvin : Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution |publisher=Whoi.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the voyage to the ocean bottom is still a challenging experience. Scientists are working to find ways to study this extreme environment from the shipboard. With more sophisticated use of [[fiber optics]], [[satellite]]s, and remote-control robots, scientists one day may explore the deep sea from a computer screen on the deck rather than out of a porthole.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

== Milestones of deep sea exploration ==
The extreme conditions in the deep sea require elaborate methods and technologies, which has been the main reason why its exploration has a comparatively short history.
In the following, important key stones of deep sea exploration are listed.

*1521: [[Ferdinand Magellan]] tried to measure the depth of the Pacific Ocean with a weighted line, but did not find bottom.
*1818: The British researcher [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|Sir John Ross]] was the first to find that the deep sea is inhabited by life when catching [[jellyfish]] and [[worm]]s in about {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} depth with a special device. 
*1843: Nevertheless, [[Edward Forbes]] claimed that diversity of life in the deep sea is little and decreases with increasing depth. He stated that there could be no life in waters deeper than {{convert|550|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}, the so-called [[Abyssus theory]].
*1850: Near the [[Lofoten]], [[Michael Sars]] found a rich deep sea fauna in a depth of {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} thereby refuting the Abyssus Theory.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Darmstaedter (Hrsg.): ''[http://www.digitalis.uni-koeln.de/Darmstaedter/darmstaedter_index.html Handbuch zur Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften und der Technik]'', Springer, Berlin 1908, S. 521&lt;/ref&gt;
*1872–1876: The first systematic deep sea exploration was conducted by the [[Challenger Expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] on board the ship {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} led by [[Charles Wyville Thomson]]. This expedition revealed that the deep sea harbours a diverse, specialized biota.
*1890–1898: First Austrian-Hungarian deep sea expedition on board the ship {{SMS|Pola}} led by [[Franz Steindachner]] in the eastern [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]].
*1898–1899: First German deep sea expedition on board the ship ''Valdivia'' led by [[Carl Chun]]; found many new species from depths greater than {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]]. 
*1930: [[William Beebe]] and [[Otis Barton]] are the first humans to reach the Deep Sea when diving in the so-called [[Bathysphere]], made from steel. They reach a depth of {{convert|435|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}, where they observed jellyfish and [[shrimp]].
*1934: The Bathysphere reached a depth of {{convert|923|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.
*1948: [[Otis Barton]] set out for a new record reaching a depth of {{convert|1370|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.
*1960: [[Jacques Piccard]] and [[Don Walsh]] reached the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]] in the [[Mariana Trench]], descending to a depth of {{convert|10,740|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in their deep sea vessel {{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste||2}}, where they observed fish and other deep sea organisms.
*2012: The vessel {{ship||Deepsea Challenger}}, piloted by [[James Cameron]], completes the second manned voyage and first solo mission to the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]].

==Oceanographic instrumentation&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;==
[[File:PSM V76 D201 Deep sea exploration apparatus.png|thumbnail|Deep sea exploration apparatus,1910]]
The sounding weight, one of the first instruments used for the sea bottom investigation, was designed as a tube on the base which forced the seabed in when it hit the bottom of the ocean. British explorer Sir [[James Clark Ross]] fully employed this instrument to reach a depth of {{convert|3,700|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in 1840.&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Deep-Sea Exploration: Earth's Final Frontier Only a Portion of the Potential of the Oceans Has Been Tapped, but It Is Clear That Exploring and Improving Our Understanding of the Ocean and Its Influence on Global Events Are among Our Most Important Challenges Today Journal article by Stephen L. Baird; The Technology Teacher, Vol. 65, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sounding weights used on {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} were slightly advanced called "Baillie sounding machine". The British researchers used wire-line soundings to investigate sea depths and collected hundreds of biological samples from all the oceans except the [[Arctic]]. Also used on HMS ''Challenger'' were dredges and scoops, suspended on ropes, with which samples of the sediment and biological specimens of the seabed could be obtained.&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;

A more advanced version of the sounding weight is the gravity corer. The gravity corer allows researchers to sample and study sediment layers at the bottom of oceans. The corer consists of an open-ended tube with a lead weight and a trigger mechanism that releases the corer from its suspension cable when the corer is lowered over the seabed and a small weight touches the ground. The corer falls into the seabed and penetrates it to a depth of up to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. By lifting the corer, a long, cylindrical sample is extracted in which the structure of the seabed’s layers of sediment is preserved. Recovering sediment cores allows scientists to see the presence or absence of specific fossils in the mud that may indicate climate patterns at times in the past, such as during the ice ages. Samples of deeper layers can be obtained with a corer mounted in a drill. The drilling vessel [[JOIDES Resolution]] is equipped to extract cores from depths of as much as {{convert|1,500|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} below the ocean bottom. (See [[Ocean Drilling Program]])&lt;ref name="ecnext1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/5246/article-1G1-140513262/deepsea-exploration-earth-final-frontier-only-portion |title=Deep-sea exploration: Earth's final frontier: only a portion of the potential of the oceans has been tapped, but it is clear that exploring and improving our understanding of the ocean and its influence on global events are among our most important challenges today. &amp;#124; Goliath Business News |publisher=Goliath.ecnext.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/instruments/viewInstrument.do?id=1079 |title=WHOI : Instruments : Gravity Corer |publisher=Whoi.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Echo-sounding instruments have also been widely used to determine the depth of the sea bottom since [[World War II]]. This instrument is used primarily for determining the depth of water by means of an acoustic echo. A pulse of sound sent from the ship is reflected from the sea bottom back to the ship, the interval of time between transmission and reception being proportional to the depth of the water. By registering the time lapses between outgoing and returning signals continuously on paper tape, a continuous mapping of the seabed is obtained. The majority of the ocean floor has been mapped in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/echo-sounder |title=echo sounder: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, high-resolution television cameras, [[thermometer]]s, pressure meters, and [[seismograph]]s are other notable instruments for deep-sea exploration invented by the technological advance. These instruments are either lowered to the sea bottom by long cables or directly attached to submersible [[buoy]]s. Deep-sea currents can be studied by floats carrying an ultrasonic sound device so that their movements can be tracked from aboard the research vessel. Such vessels themselves are equipped with state -of-art navigational instruments, such as [[satellite]] navigation systems, and [[global positioning system]]s that keep the vessel in a live position relative to a sonar beacon on the bottom of the ocean.&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;

==Oceanographic submersibles==
Because of the high pressure, the depth to which a diver can descend without special equipment is limited. The deepest recorded made by a skin diver is {{convert|127|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Revolutionary new diving suits, such as the "[[JIM suit]]," allows divers to reach depths up to approximately {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of Communications and Marketing |url=http://www.expeditions.udel.edu/extreme08/tools/discovery.php |title=Depths of Discovery |publisher=Expeditions.udel.edu |date=2004-10-30 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some additional suits feature [[Marine propulsion|thruster]] packs that boost a diver to different locations underwater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deepseasystems.com/thl404-8d.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417093811/http://www.deepseasystems.com/thl404-8d.htm |date=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explore even deeper depths, deep-sea explorers must rely on specially constructed steel chambers to protect them. The American explorer [[William Beebe]], also a naturalist from [[Columbia University]] in New York, was the designer of the first practical bathysphere to observe marine species at depths that could not be reached by a diver.&lt;ref name="jrank1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/7100/Underwater-Exploration.html |title=Underwater Exploration - History, Oceanography, Instrumentation, Diving Tools And Techniques, Deep-sea Submersible Vessels, Key Findings In Underwater Exploration - Deep-sea pioneers |publisher=Science.jrank.org |date=1960-01-23 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bathysphere]], a spherical steel vessel, was designed by Beebe and his fellow engineer [[Otis Barton]], an engineer at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/769/Bathysphere.html |title=Bathysphere - Air, Sea, Exploration, Diving, Bell, and Scientists |publisher=Science.jrank.org |date=1930-06-06 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 Beebe and Barton reached a depth of {{convert|435|m|ft|abbr=on|0}},  and {{convert|923|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in 1934. The potential danger was that if the cable broke, the occupants could not return to the surface. During the dive, Beebe peered out of a porthole and reported his observations by telephone to Barton who was on the surface.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.productivitydevelopment.com/26%20Deep%20Sea%20Explore.pdf|title=Deep Sea Explore|publisher=Productivitydevelopment.com|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Swiss physicist [[Auguste Piccard]] tested a much deeper-diving vessel he invented called the [[bathyscaphe]], a navigable deep-sea vessel with its gasoline-filled float and suspended chamber or gondola of spherical steel.&lt;ref name="jrank1"/&gt; On an experimental dive in the [[Cape Verde Islands]], his bathyscaphe successfully withstood the pressure on it at {{convert|1,402|m|abbr=on|0}}, but its body was severely damaged by heavy waves after the dive. In 1954, with this bathyscaphe, Piccard reached a depth of {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref name="jrank1"/&gt; In 1953, his son [[Jacques Piccard]] joined in building new and improved bathyscaphe {{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste||2}}, which dived to {{convert|3,139|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}  in field trials.&lt;ref name="jrank1"/&gt; The [[United States Navy]] acquired ''Trieste'' in 1958 and equipped it with a new cabin to enable it to reach deep ocean trenches.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt; In 1960, Jacques Piccard and United States Navy Lieutenant Donald Walsh descended in ''Trieste'' to the deepest known point on Earth - the [[Challenger Deep]] in the [[Mariana Trench]], successfully making the deepest dive in history: {{convert|10,915|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;
 
An increasing number of occupied submersibles are now employed around the world. The American-built {{ship|DSV|Alvin}} that is operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], is a three-person submarine that can dive to about {{convert|3,600|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} and is equipped with a mechanical manipulator to collect bottom samples.&lt;ref name="sciencebase1"&gt;{{cite web|author=TechTalk |url=http://www.sciencebase.com/deep_sea_exploration.html |title=Deep sea exploration and marine science aboard Alvin et al - 11/04 |publisher=Sciencebase.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alvin'' made its first test dive in 1964, and has performed more than 3,000 dives to average depths of {{convert|1,829|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. ''Alvin'' has also involved in a wide variety of research projects, such as one where [[giant tube worm]]s were discovered on the [[Pacific Ocean]] floor near the [[Galápagos Islands]].&lt;ref name="sciencebase1"/&gt;

===Unmanned submersibles===
[[File:Autonomous landers, Observing the deepest places on Earth.WebM|thumb|left|240px|Describing the operation and use of autonomous landers in deep sea research.]]
One of the first unmanned deep sea vehicles was developed by the University of California with a grant from the Allan Hancock Foundation in the early 1950s to develop a more economical method of taking photos miles under the sea with an unmanned steel high-pressure {{convert|3,000|lb|abbr=on|0}} sphere called a '''benthograph''' which contained a camera and strobe light.  The original benthograph built by USC was very successful in taking a series of underwater photos until it became wedged between some rocks and could not be retrieved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zdwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=true#v=onepage&amp;q=true&amp;f=true "Deep Sea Photographers."] ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1953, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

ROVs, or [[remote operated vehicle]]s, are seeing increasing use in underwater exploration. These submersibles are piloted through a cable which connects to the surface ship, and they can reach depths of up to {{convert|6,000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. New developments in robotics have also led to the creation of AUVs, or [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s. The robotic submarines are programmed in advance, and receive no instruction from the surface. HROV combine features of both ROVs and AUV, operating independently or with a cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-science/deep-ocean-exploration/tools-and-technology/|title=The Deep Sea|author=The Ocean Portal Team|date=24 July 2012|work=Smithsonian Ocean Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enchantedlearning1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/explorers/page/b/ballard.shtml |title=Robert Ballard: Undersea Explorers |publisher=EnchantedLearning.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{ship||Argo|ROV|2}} was employed in 1985 to locate the wreck of {{RMS|Titanic}}; the smaller {{ship||Jason|ROV|2}} was also used to explore the shipwreck.&lt;ref name="enchantedlearning1"/&gt;

==Scientific results==
In 1974, ''Alvin'' (operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] and the Deep Sea Place Research Center), the French bathyscaphe ''[[Archimède]]'', and the French diving saucer ''Cyane'', assisted by support ships and {{ship||Glomar Challenger}}, explored the great rift valley of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], southwest of the [[Azores]]. About 5,200 photographs of the region were taken, and samples of relatively young solidified [[magma]] were found on each side of the central fissure of the rift valley, giving additional proof that the seafloor spreads at this site at a rate of about {{convert|2.5|cm|in|1}} per year (see [[plate tectonics]],).&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;[http://www.history.com/content/deepseadetectives/history-of-deep-sea-exploration ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208003634/http://www.history.com/content/deepseadetectives/history-of-deep-sea-exploration |date=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''Francis Buchanan''' [[Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Linnean Society|FLS]] FAS FSA DL (15 February 1762 – 15 June 1829), later known as '''Francis Hamilton''' but often referred to as '''Francis Buchanan-Hamilton''', was a Scottish physician who made significant contributions as a geographer, zoologist, and botanist while living in India.

The standard botanical author abbreviation '''Buch.-Ham.''' is applied to plants and animals he described, though today the form "Hamilton, 1822" is more usually seen in [[ichthyology]] and is preferred by [[Fishbase]].

==Early life==
Francis Buchanan was born at Bardowie, [[Callander]], [[Perthshire]] where Elizabeth, his mother, lived in the estate of Branziet; his father Thomas, a physician, came in [[Stirling|Spittal]] and claimed the chiefdom of the name of [[Clan Buchanan|Buchanan]] and owned Leny estate matriculated in 1774 and received an MA in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical index of former fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he had three older brothers, he had to earn a living from a profession and Buchanan studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]] graduating MD in 1783. His thesis was on ''febris intermittens'' (malaria). He then served on [[Merchant Navy]] ships to Asia, he served in the [[Bengal Medical Service]] from 1794 to 1815. He also studied botany under [[John Hope (botanist)|John Hope]] in Edinburgh. Hope was among the first in Britain to teach the Linnean system of botanical nomenclature although he knew of several others having been trained under Jussieu.&lt;ref name=biopart1 /&gt;

==Career in India==
Buchanan's early career was on board ships plying between England and Asia. The first few years were spent as Surgeon aboard the ''Duke of Montrose'' sailing between Bombay and China under Captain Alexander Gray and later Captain Joseph Dorin. He then served on the ''Phoenix'' along the Coromandel Coast again under Captain Gray. In 1794 he served on the ''Rose'', sailing from Portsmouth to Calcutta and reaching Calcutta in September, he joined the Medical Service of the Bengal Presidency. Buchanan's training was ideal as a Surgeon naturalist for a political mission to the Kingdom of Ava in Burma under Captain Symes (as replacement for the previously appointed Surgeon Peter Cochrane). The Ava mission set sail on the ''Sea Horse'' and would pass the Andaman Islands, Pegu and Ava before returning to Calcutta.&lt;ref name=biopart1 &gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00033790.2016.1195446|pmid=27399603|title=Career, collections, reports and publications of Dr Francis Buchanan (later Hamilton), 1762–1829: Natural history studies in Nepal, Burma (Myanmar), Bangladesh and India.

[[File:Buchanan Journey map.jpg|thumb|right|Map illustrating Buchanan-Hamilton's journey through southern India]]
In 1799, after the defeat of [[Tipu Sultan]] and [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War|the fall of Mysore]], he was asked to survey [[South India]] resulting in ''A Journey from Madras through the Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar'' (1807). He also wrote ''An Account of the Kingdom of Nepal'' (1819).

He conducted two surveys, the first of Mysore in 1800 and the second of Bengal in 1807-14. From 1803 to 1804 he was surgeon to the Governor General of India [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Lord Wellesley]] in [[Calcutta]], where he also organized a zoo that was to become the Calcutta [[Alipore Zoo]]. In 1804, he was in charge of the ''Institution for Promoting the Natural History of India'' founded by Wellesley at [[Barrackpore]].

From 1807 to 1814, under the instructions of the government of [[Bengal]], he made a comprehensive survey of the areas within the jurisdiction of the [[British East India Company]].  He was asked to report on topography, history, antiquities, the condition of the inhabitants, religion, natural productions (particularly fisheries, forests, mines, and quarries),  agriculture (covering vegetables, implements, manure, floods, domestic animals, fences, farms, and landed property, fine and common arts, and commerce (exports and imports, weights and measures, and conveyance of goods).  His conclusions are reported in a series of treatises that are retained in major United Kingdom libraries; many have been re-issued in modern editions.  They include an important work on Indian fish species, entitled ''An account of the fishes found in the river Ganges and its branches'' (1822), which describes over 100 species not formerly recognised scientifically.

He also collected and described many new [[plant]]s in the region, and collected a series of watercolours of Indian and [[Nepal]]ese plants and animals, probably painted by Indian artists, which are now in the library of the [[Linnean Society of London]]  [https://web.archive.org/web/20120705004529/http://www.linnean-online.org/view/buchanan_hamilton/buchanan_hamilton.html]

He was elected a  [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in May, 1806 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27buchanan%27%29| title= Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher= Royal Society| accessdate= 20 December 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in January 1817

==Later life==
He succeeded [[William Roxburgh]] to become the Superintendent of the [[Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden|Calcutta botanical garden]] in 1814, but had to return to Britain in 1815 due to his ill health. In an interesting incident the notes that he took of Hope's botany lectures in 1780 were lent to his shipmate Alexander Boswell during a voyage in 1785. Boswell, lost the notes in [[Satyamangalam]] in Mysore and the notes went into the hands of [[Tipu Sultan]] who had them rebound. In 1800 they were found in Tippu's library by a major who returned them   to Buchanan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Buchanan left India in 1815, and in the same year inherited his mother's estate and in consequence took her surname of Hamilton, referring to himself as "Francis Hamilton, formerly Buchanan" or simply "Francis Hamilton".  However he is variously referred to by others as "Buchanan-Hamilton", "Francis Hamilton Buchanan" or "Francis Buchanan Hamilton".{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The '''Geography of [[Guyana]]''' comprises the physical characteristics of the country in Northern [[South America]] and part of [[Caribbean South America]], bordering the North [[Atlantic Ocean]], between [[Suriname]] and [[Venezuela]], with a land area of approximately 214,969 square kilometres. The country is situated between 1 and 9 north latitude and between 56 and 62 west longitude. With a 459-kilometre Atlantic coastline on the northeast, Guyana is bounded by Venezuela on the west, [[Brazil]] on the west and south, and Suriname on the east. The land comprises three main geographical zones: the coastal plain, the white sand belt, and the interior highlands.

==Description==
The coastal plain, which occupies about 5 percent of the country's area, is home to more than 90 percent of its inhabitants. The plain ranges from 26 to 77 kilometers wide and extends from the [[Corentyne River]] in the east to the Venezuelan border in the northwest.

The coastal plain is made up largely of alluvial mud swept out to sea by the Amazon River, carried north by ocean currents, and deposited on the Guyanese shores. A rich clay of great fertility, this mud overlays the white sands and clays formed from the erosion of the interior bedrock and carried seaward by the rivers of Guyana. Because much of the coastal plain floods at high tide, efforts to dam and drain this area have gone on since the 18th century.

Guyana has no well-defined shoreline or sandy beaches. Approaching the ocean, the land gradually loses elevation until it includes many areas of marsh and swamp. Seaward from the vegetation line is a region of mud flats, shallow brown water, and sandbars. Off New Amsterdam, these mud flats extend almost {{convert|25|km}}. The sandbars and shallow water are a major impediment to shipping, and incoming vessels must partially unload their cargoes offshore in order to reach the docks at [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] and [[New Amsterdam, Guyana|New Amsterdam]].

A line of swamps forms a barrier between the white sandy hills of the interior and the coastal plain. These swamps, formed when water was prevented from flowing onto coastal croplands by a series of dams, serve as reservoirs during periods of drought.

The white sand belt lies south of the coastal zone. This area is 150 to 250 kilometers wide and consists of low sandy hills interspersed with rocky outcroppings. The white sands support a dense hardwood forest. These sands cannot support crops, and if the trees are removed erosion is rapid and severe. Most of Guyana's reserves of bauxite, gold, and diamonds are found in this region.

The largest of Guyana's three geographical regions is the interior highlands, a series of plateaus, flat-topped mountains, and savannahs that extend from the white sand belt to the country's southern borders. The [[Pacaraima Mountains]] dominate the western part of the interior highlands. In this region are found some of the oldest sedimentary rocks in the Western Hemisphere. [[Mount Roraima]], on the Venezuelan border, is part of the Pakaraima range and, at 2,762 meters, is Guyana's tallest peak. Farther south lies the Kaieteur Plateau, a broad, rocky area about 600 meters in elevation; the 1,000-meter high [[Kanuku Mountains]]; and the low [[Acarai Mountains]] situated on the southern border with Brazil.

Much of the interior highlands consist of grassland. The largest expanse of grassland, the Rupununi Savannah, covers about 15,000 square kilometers in southern Guyana. This savannah also extends far into Venezuela and Brazil. The part in Guyana is split into northern and southern regions by the Kanuku Mountains. The sparse grasses of the savannah in general support only grazing, although Amerindian groups cultivate a few areas along the [[Rupununi River]] and in the foothills of the Kanuku Mountains.

==Hydrology==
[[Image:Essequiborivermap.png|right|thumb|280px|Map of the Essequibo drainage basin]]
Guyana is a water-rich country. Numerous rivers flow into the Atlantic Ocean, generally in a northward direction. A number of rivers in the western part of the country, however, flow eastward into the [[Essequibo River]], draining the Kaieteur Plateau. The Essequibo, the country's major river, runs from the Brazilian border in the south to a wide delta west of Georgetown. The rivers of eastern Guyana cut across the coastal zone, making east-west travel difficult, but they also provide limited water access to the interior.

Waterfalls generally limit water transport to the lower reaches of each river. Some of the waterfalls are spectacular; for example, [[Kaieteur Falls]] on the [[Potaro River]] drops 251 metres, more than four times the height of [[Niagara Falls]]. Other enormous waterfalls are [[King Edward VIII Falls]] (256 m), Kumerau Falls (190 m), Oshi Falls (160 – 210 m). In the country are known to exist more than 200 rapids and more than 70 large waterfalls. Many waterfalls are little known and most are not measured yet, it is possible that there are waterfalls in excess of 300 m tall.

See also [[:Category:Rivers of Guyana]], [[:Category:Waterfalls of Guyana]].

Drainage throughout most of Guyana is poor and river flow sluggish because the average gradient of the main rivers is only one meter every five kilometers. Swamps and areas of periodic flooding are found in all but the mountainous regions, and all new land projects require extensive drainage networks before they are suitable for agricultural use. The average square kilometer on a sugar plantation, for example, has six kilometers of irrigation canals, eighteen kilometers of large drains, and eighteen kilometers of small drains. These canals occupy nearly one-eighth of the surface area of the average sugarcane field. Some of the larger estates have more than 550 kilometers of canals; Guyana itself has a total of more than 8,000 kilometers. Even Georgetown is below sea level and must depend on dikes for protection from the [[Demerara River]] and the Atlantic Ocean.

Lying near the [[equator]], Guyana has a [[tropical climate]], and temperatures do not vary much throughout the year. The year has two [[wet season]]s, from December to early February and from late April to mid-August.

Although the temperature never gets dangerously high, the combination of heat and humidity can at times seem oppressive. The entire area is under the influence of the northeast trade winds, and during the midday and afternoon sea breezes bring relief to the coast. Guyana lies south of the path of Caribbean hurricanes and none is known to have hit the country.

Temperatures in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] are quite constant, with an average high of {{convert|32|°C|1}} and an average low of {{convert|24|°C|1}} in the hottest month (July), and an average range of {{convert|29|to|23|°C|°F|1}} in February, the coolest month. The highest temperature ever recorded in the capital was {{convert|37.7|°C}} and the lowest  {{convert|16.6|°C}}. Humidity averages 70 percent year-round. Locations in the interior, away from the moderating influence of the ocean, experience slightly wider variations in daily temperature, and nighttime readings as low as {{convert|12|°C|1}} have been recorded. Humidity in the interior is also slightly lower, averaging around 60 percent.

Rainfall is heaviest in the northwest and lightest in the southeast and interior. Annual averages on the coast near the Venezuelan border are near {{convert|2500|mm|in|1}}, farther east at [[New Amsterdam, Guyana|New Amsterdam]], between {{convert|2000|and|1500|mm|in|1}} in southern Guyana's [[Rupununi Savannah]]. Areas on the northeast sides of mountains that catch the trade winds average as much as {{convert|3500|mm|in|1}} of precipitation annually. Although rain falls throughout the year, about 50 percent of the annual total arrives in the summer rainy season that extends from May to the end of July along the coast and from April through September farther inland. Coastal areas have a second rainy season from November through January. Rain generally falls in heavy afternoon showers or thunderstorms. Overcast days are rare; most days include four to eight hours of sunshine from morning through early afternoon.

==History==
The Geological Survey of Bangladesh was founded in 1971 immediately after the Independence of Bangladesh. The organization was formed out of the remnaints of Geological Survey of Pakistan in East Pakistan. The [[Geological Survey of Pakistan]] traces its origins to the [[Geological Survey of India]] which was founded in 1836.&lt;ref name="rds"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The agency is run by the [[Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources|Ministry of Mineral Resources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geological Survey of Bangladesh to drill in Naogaon|url=http://bdnews24.com/economy/2016/02/05/geological-survey-of-bangladesh-to-drill-in-naogaon|website=bdnews24.com|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has discovered a number of mines in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Coal|title=Coal - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4735">The '''Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)''' is a spatial database of the [[country subdivision|administrative units]] for all the [[country|countries]] in the world. It is a project of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the [[United Nations]]. 

==Mission==
The GAUL aims at compiling and disseminating the most reliable geographic information on [[country subdivision|administrative units]] for all the [[country|countries]] in the world, thereby contributing to the standardization of the spatial dataset representing administrative units. In this framework, its purposes are:

* to overcome the fragmentation of the global dataset occurring when administrative units layers are digitized on a country-by-country basis
* to keep historical track of changes occurring on the shapes and extent of the administrative units
* to promote a unified [[georeference|coding]] system that reduces maintenance efforts.

==Characteristics==
The GAUL always maintains global geographic layers (in [[shapefile]] format) with a unified coding system at the levels of country, first administrative (e.g. regions), and second administrative (e.g. districts). In addition, when data is available, it provides layers on a country-by-country basis down to third, fourth and lower levels. The target beneficiary of the GAUL data is the UN community, universities, and other authorized international and national institutions/agencies. Data might not be officially validated by authoritative national sources and can not be distributed to the general public. A disclaimer should always accompany any use of the GAUL data. 

Because the GAUL works at global level, controversial [[border|boundaries]] can not be ignored. The approach of the GAUL is to maintain [[territorial dispute|disputed]] areas in such a way to preserve national integrity for all disputing countries.

The coastline of the GAUL is mostly compliant with the coast of the International Boundary map delivered by the UN Cartographic Section except for some countries (e.g. [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], etc.) where it has been updated according to the satellite images (e.g. [[Landsat program|Landsat]] ETM). For future releases of the GAUL, the process of updating the coastline will go on, country by country, through a comparison with the satellite images.

The GAUL keeps track of administrative units that have been changed, added, or deleted in the past. Changes implemented in different years are recorded in the GAUL on different layers. For this reason the GAUL product is not a single layer but a group of layers, named the '''GAUL Set'''. The GAUL project does not implement changes dated before 1990.

GAUL codes are numeric and unique for all administrative units at any of the administrative hierarchical level. Any GAUL code is independent from the codes of its higher administrative levels. GAUL codes assigned to administrative units of a given country are not necessarily sequential numbers. The main benefit of the GAUL Coding System is that changing in the codes of an administrative unit might not imply a change of codes of the correspondent units at lower levels. This means that the effort to maintain the links between thematic data and associated administrative units is reduced to a minimum.

==Organization==
The implementation of the GAUL initiative is based on a collaborative work among international agencies and national authorities generating and collecting spatial information on administrative units. The role of FAO is to keep this network of collaborators active, to evaluate and compile data from available sources, to establish procedures for data integration, to generate the GAUL codes and periodically to disseminate the GAUL Set. The overall methodology consists in:

# collecting the best available data from most reliable sources
# establishing validation periods of the geographic features (when possible)
# adding selected data to the global layer based on the international boundaries provided by the UN Cartographic Unit
# generating codes using the GAUL Coding System
# distributing data to the users

The GAUL has a consistent framework for the delivery of the data. Once a year, an updated version of the GAUL set is released through [http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/ Geonetwork].  A new version includes all updates made in the course of the previous year. The dataset is free of charge and it can be downloaded by login (to receive an account, just send an email to the contacts listed at the bottom of this article). The new version GAUL 2009 will be available on Geonetwork from January 2009.

[[File:Iceberg C19.jpg|thumb|Iceberg C-19 breaking off from the Ross Ice Shelf, 11 May 2002, image:[[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program|DMSP]].]]

'''Iceberg C-19''' is an [[iceberg]] that [[Ice calving|calved]] from the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] on May 2002 on a fissure scientists had been watching since the 1980s. After that the Ross Ice Shelf returned to the size it was in 1911, when it was mapped by [[Robert F. Scott]]’s party. It was the second-largest iceberg to calve in the region in a few years (after [[Iceberg B-15|B-15]]). It had a surface area larger than 5500&amp;nbsp;km².

During 2002 C-19 prevented sea ice from moving out of the southwestern [[Ross Sea]] region and this blockage resulted in an unusually high sea ice level during spring and summer, thus provoking a huge reduction in [[phytoplankton]] production which is at the base of the food chain.

In summer 2003 C-19 moved northward very rapidly, passed [[Cape Adare]], and broke in two pieces: C-19A and C-19B.

In September 2005, after a two year stay along the coast of [[Victoria Land]] (west of French station [[Dumont d'Urville Station|Dumont d'Urville]]) C-19A started drifting northward. In March 2006 its location was in the Pacific Ocean, 200&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Balleny Islands]].

In 2008, C-19A was renamed '''''Melting Bob''''' by Max Dolan as a result of a contest sponsored by the [[Hay Festival]] and the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]]. As of May 2008, its surface area was approximately 5141&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name="bob"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/hampshire/7429046.stm Schoolboy first to 'name' iceberg], [[BBC]], 2008-05-31, retrieved 2008-05-31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Municipis de la diòcesi de Tortosa.png|thumb|Present extent of the Diocese of Tortosa.]]
[[File:Vallibona80.JPG|thumb|[[Virgin Mary]] on the wall of the Vallibona main church honoring the traditional bonds between the towns of [[Vallibona]] ([[Valencian Community]]) and [[Pena-roja]] (Peñarroya de Tastavins) over the hills in [[Matarranya]], [[Aragon]].]]
'''Ilercavonia''' ({{lang-ca|Ilercavònia}}, {{lang-es|Ilercavonia}}) is an ancient [[comarca]] of [[Spain]] formerly populated by the [[ancient Iberian]] tribe known as [[Ilercavones]]. It is a greater comarca made up of smaller ones. The ties between the people of the region transcend [[Autonomous communities of Spain|ancient kingdom]] and later [[Provinces of Spain|provincial]] borders.

==History==
The name 'Ilercavonia' to refer to the territory occupied by the Ilercavones Iberian tribe appears in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] texts and documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gencat.cat/ptop/actuacions/informacio_publica/peu_central_asco/documents/12_01_prospeccio_arqueologica.pdf Memòria de la prospecció arqueològica l/110kv Ascó - SE Tortosa]&lt;/ref&gt; The northern limits of this territory were in [[Serra de la Llena]], the northeastern in [[Coll de Balaguer]], the western in [[Mequinensa]] and the southern in the area of a river mentioned as 'Oduba' in Roman documents, which could be either the [[Millars River]], or another river further south along the coast closer to [[Sagunt]]. This geographical zone corresponds roughly to the present-day [[Maestrat/Maestrazgo]], [[Matarraña/Matarranya]] and [[Terres de l'Ebre]] comarcas.

During the [[Middle Ages]] the territory of Ilercavonia found itself located at the confluence of the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], [[Catalonia]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]. Since that time, and until the mid-20th century, the [[Diocese of Tortosa]] would give a certain basic recognition to the people of this [[historical region|ancient region]] who, despite having had no historic political representation of their own, share common geographic, economic, cultural and linguistic ties. The traditional [[Aragon]]ese parishes of the Diocese of Tortosa, however, were segregated during [[General Franco]]'s [[dictatorship]], following the [[Concordat of 1953]] between the [[Francoist regime]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''Franco's Spain'', London 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the lack of recognition and effective representation, this greater comarca has suffered much from a lack of development and investment since the mid-20th century, when the only railway line connecting the region with Aragon, the [[RENFE]] line from [[Tortosa]] to [[Alcañiz]] and [[Zaragoza]], was terminated in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vilaweb.cat/www/elpunt/noticia?p_idcmp=3504938 El Punt - El cruel divorci entre Tortosa i el tren]&lt;/ref&gt; This line was dismantled as a result of a 1962 [[World Bank]] report advising the [[Spanish State]] to concentrate investment in the great lines and to abandon the less profitable railways connecting rural areas. The bulk of the development in eastern and northeastern Spain was henceforward diverted to the cities of [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] in detriment of this region.

Nowadays the name Ilercavonia is used mainly in academic and scientific circles, as well as in cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avui.elpunt.cat/noticia/article/7-vista/8-articles/159482-la-ilercavonia-encara-es-viva.html?piwik_campaign=rss&amp;piwik_kwd=mes La Ilercavònia encara és viva]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jura Mountains''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒyʁa|lang}}; {{IPA-de|ˈjuːra|lang}}, &lt;small&gt;locally&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈjuːɾa|}}; {{lang-fr|Massif du Jura}}; {{lang-de|Juragebirge}}; {{lang-it|Massiccio del Giura}}) are a [[Montane ecosystem|sub-alpine]] [[mountain range]] located north of the [[Western Alps]], mainly following the course of the [[France–Switzerland border]]. 
The Jura separates the  [[Rhine]] and [[Rhône]] basins, forming part of the [[drainage divide|watershed]] of each. 

The name "Jura" is derived from ''juria'', a Latinized form of a  [[Continental Celtic|Celtic]] stem ''jor-'' "forest".&lt;ref name="Rollier, 1903"&gt;Rollier, L. 1903.

The mountain range gives its name to the French department of [[Jura (department)|Jura]], the Swiss [[Canton of Jura]], the [[Jurassic]] period of the [[geologic timescale]], and the [[Montes Jura]] of the Moon.

==Physiography==
The Jura Mountains are a distinct  province of the larger [[Central European uplands]].

In France, the Jura covers most of the [[Franche-Comté]] region, stretching south into the [[Rhône-Alpes]] region. The range reaches its highest point at [[Le Crêt de la Neige]] in the department of [[Ain]] and finds its southern terminus in the northwestern part of the department of [[Savoie]]. The north end of the Jura extends into the southern tip of the [[Alsace]] region.  Roughly {{cvt|1600|km2|-2}} of the mountain range in France is protected by the [[Parc naturel régional du Haut-Jura|Jura Mountains Regional Natural Park]].

The Swiss Jura is one of the three distinct geographical regions of Switzerland, the others being the [[Swiss plateau]] and the [[Swiss Alps]].
In Switzerland, the range covers the western border with France in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]]s of [[Basel-Landschaft]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] (i.e., [[Bernese Jura]]), [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]], [[Vaud]]. 
Much of the Swiss Jura region has no historical association with [[Early Modern Switzerland]] and was incorporated as  part of the Swiss Confederacy only in the 19th century. In the 20th century, a movement of [[Jurassic separatism]] developed which resulted in the creation of the [[canton of Jura]] in 1979.

The Swiss Jura has been industrialized since the 18th century and became a major centre of the [[watchmaker|watchmaking]] industry. The area has several cities at very high altitudes, such as [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], [[Le Locle]], and [[Sainte-Croix, Switzerland|Sainte-Croix]] (renowned for its [[musical box]]es); however, it generally has had a marked decline in population since 1960. 

The Jura range proper (known as "folded Jura", ''Faltenjura'') is continued as the [[Table Jura]] in the cantons of [[Basel-Landschaft]] and [[Aargau]], and further to [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]] and into southern Germany towards the [[Swabian Jura|Swabia]]n and [[Franconian Jura|Franconia]]n plateaus.

===Geology===
[[Image:Creux-du-Van vertical.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Inward-curving cliff of the Creux du Van|[[Creux du Van]]]]
The range is built up vertically while decreasing in size laterally (along a rough northwest–southeast line). This deformation accommodates the compression from alpine folding as the main [[Alpine orogeny|Alpine orogenic]] front moves roughly northwards. The deformation becomes less pervasive away from the younger, more active Alpine mountain building.

The geologic folds comprise three major bands ([[lithological]] units) of building that date from three [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]s: the Lias ([[Early Jurassic]]), the Dogger ([[Middle Jurassic]]) and the Malm ([[Late Jurassic]]) [[geologic period]]s. Each era of folding reveals effects of previously shallow marine environments as evidenced by beds with [[calcite|carbonate]] sequences, containing abundant [[bioclast]]s and [[oolite|oolitic]] divisions between layers (called horizons).

Structurally, the Jura consists of a sequence of &lt;!-- "Owen": no references found for "Owen fold" or "Owen folds" --&gt;geologic folds, the formation of which is facilitated by an [[evaporite|evaporitic]] [[decollement]] layer. The box folds are still relatively young, which is evident by the general shape of the [[landscape]] showing that they have not existed long enough to experience [[erosion]], thus revealing recent mountain building.

The highest peak in the Jura range is Le [[Crêt de la Neige]] at {{cvt|1720|m|ft|0}}.

== Tourism ==
The Jura range offer a variety of tourist activities including hiking, cycling, downhill skiing and cross-country skiing. There are many signposted trails including the [[Jura ridgeway]], a {{cvt|310|km}} hiking route.

Tourist attractions include natural features such as the [[Creux du Van]], lookout peaks such as the [[Chasseral]], caves such as the [[Grottes de l'Orbe]], and [[Canyon|gorges]] such as [[Taubenloch]].

Both [[Le Locle]] and its geographical twin town [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]] are recognised as an UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] for their [[horology|horological]] and related cultural past. The 11th-century [[Fort de Joux]], famously remodeled and strengthened by [[Vauban]] in 1690 and subsequently by other military engineers, is situated on a natural rock outcropping in the middle of the range not far from [[Pontarlier]].

Part of the [[A40 autoroute]] crosses through a portion of the southern Jura between [[Bourg-en-Bresse]] and [[Bellegarde-sur-Valserine]], which is known as the "Highway of the Titans".

[[File:Three Corton bottles.jpg|thumb|250px|Three bottles of red [[Corton AOC]] wine, from the same appellation, showing different usages of ''lieu-dit'' (''climat'') designations on labels, in addition to the appellation's name. On the left, a wine with no indication of specific ''lieu-dit'', in the middle a wine where ''Le Rognet'' is indicated in small print, and on the right a wine from ''Les Renardes'', written hyphenated with Corton as "Corton-Renardes".]]
'''''Lieu-dit''''' ([[plural]]: ''lieux-dits'') (literally ''said-location'') is a [[French language|French]] toponymic term for a small geographical area bearing a traditional name. The name usually refers to some characteristic of the place, its former use, a past event, etc. A lieu-dit may be uninhabited, which distinguishes it from an ''hameau'' ([[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]), which is inhabited.
In [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]], the term ''climat'' is used interchangeably with ''lieu-dit''.

==Etymology==
English speakers seem to have discovered the concept through oenology and have considered it as a [[wine term]] which in its typical usage translates as "[[vineyard]] name" or "named vineyard".&lt;ref&gt;Outside its wine usage, the term ''lieu-dit'' can refer to any type of traditional place name.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a ''lieu-dit'' is the smallest piece of land which has a traditional vineyard name assigned to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=[[Jancis Robinson]] | encyclopedia=[[Oxford Companion to Wine]] |edition= Third |title=Lieu-dit |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-860990-6 |pages=401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, this means that a ''lieu-dit'' is smaller than an ''[[appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC).

==Use in France==
[[File:Alsatian Riesling .jpg|left|thumb|An Alsatian Riesling with the name of the lieu-dit it is sourced from on the label.]]
In some cases, ''lieux-dits'' appear on wine labels, in addition to the AOC name. This is most commonly seen for [[Alsace wine]] and [[Burgundy wine]]. It may not always be easy for consumers to tell if a  name on a wine label is a ''lieu-dit'' or a [[cuvée]] name created by the producer.

The only case of mandatory mention of a ''lieu-dit'' is in Alsace, for [[Alsace Grand Cru AOC]]. The Grand Cru designation may only be used if a ''lieu-dit'' is indicated. ''Lieux-dits'' may also be indicated on regular [[Alsace AOC]] wines, but is not mandatory.

In Burgundy, the term ''climat'' is used interchangeably with ''lieu-dit''. The use of the ''lieu-dit'' varies with the level of classification of the wine. Although the [[Grand Cru]] burgundies are generally considered to be classified on the vineyard level and defined as separate AOCs (with the exception of [[Chablis]] Grand Cru), some Burgundy Grand Crus are in fact divided into several ''lieux-dits''. An example is [[Corton (wine)|Corton]], where it is fairly common to see ''lieux-dits'' such as Les Bressandes, Le Clos de Roi and Les Renardes indicated. For village level burgundies, the ''lieu-dit'' may only be indicated in smaller print than the village name to avoid confusion with [[Premier Cru]] burgundies, where the village and vineyard name are indicated in the same size print.

In [[Rhône wine|Rhône]], ''lieux-dits'' are most commonly seen for some of the top wines of the region. Two examples are the ''lieu-dit'' La Landonne or La Chatillonne within [[Côte-Rôtie]].  Not all sites have been registered as ''lieux-dits''.  For example La Mouline  and Les Jumelles are ''les marques'' of individual producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Livingstone-Learmonth |first1=John |title=The Wines of the Rhône |date=1992 |publisher=Farber and Farbe |location=London |isbn=0-571-15111-6 |page=11 |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside France==
In the [[United States (wine)|United States]], the labeling of [[vineyard designated wine]]s follows the similar practice of highlighting the particular vineyard that the grapes are sourced from.

'''Lisbon metropolitan area''' ({{lang-pt|'''Área Metropolitana de Lisboa'''}}, or {{lang|pt|'''AML'''}})  is an [[Metropolitan areas in Portugal|administrative division]] that includes 18 municipalities (''[[concelho]]s'') in [[Portugal]]&lt;ref name=law75&gt;{{cite web|title=Law nr. 75/2013|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1s/2013/09/17600/0568805724.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2014|work=[[Diário da República]]|publisher=[[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)]]|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a designated Level II and Level III Portuguese NUTS region.

==Overview==
The Lisbon metropolitan area, centered in the Portuguese [[capital city]] of [[Lisbon]], is the largest population concentration in Portugal. The population in 2011 was 2,821,876, of whom 547,733 (19.4%) live in the city of Lisbon. About 26.7% of the total population of Portugal lives in the Lisbon metropolitan area.&lt;ref name=ine&gt;[http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xlang=en&amp;xpid=INE&amp;xpgid=ine_indicadores&amp;indOcorrCod=0005889&amp;contexto=pi&amp;selTab=tab0 Instituto Nacional de Estatística]&lt;/ref&gt; The area of the Lisbon metropolitan area is 3,015.24&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 3.3% of the total area of Portugal.&lt;ref name=dgt&gt;[http://www.dgterritorio.pt/cartografia_e_geodesia/cartografia/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal_caop_/caop__download_/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal___versao_2017__em_vigor_/ Áreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e país]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lisbon metropolitan area has an active population of about 1.3 million people. With 32.7% of the national employment being located in its territory, the contribution of AML for the gross domestic product surpasses 36%.

Today, the Lisbon metropolitan area territory is almost the same as [[Lisbon Region]] territory, being AML a union of metropolitan municipalities, and Lisbon Region a [[NUTS II]] region.

The municipalities north of the Tagus River are from Lisbon District (Grande Lisboa); those south of the river are from Setubal District (Península de Setúbal).

==Structure==
The metropolitan area of Lisbon was a semiofficial structure. Recently, Portugal has been incrementing the powers held by these territorial organization organs. In the officialization of the Lisbon Great Metropolitan Area, Azambuja left due to being mostly a rustic zone, more kindred to the city of [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] which lies just 23&amp;nbsp;km northeast, while Lisbon is 45&amp;nbsp;km away from Azambuja, southeast.

In the official [https://web.archive.org/web/20050317114405/http://www.aml.pt/English/WhatIsMAL/mal.php AML site] is said:

As stated on the law 10/2003, of the 13 of May, the Grande Área Metropolitana de Lisboa (Lisbon Great Metropolitan Area) is a public collective person of associative nature, and of territorial scope that aims to reach common public interests of the municipalities that integrate it, that includes (18 City Halls) – Alcochete, Almada, Barreiro, Cascais, Lisboa, Loures, Mafra, Moita, Montijo, Odivelas, Oeiras, Palmela, Sesimbra, Setúbal, Seixal, Sintra and Vila Franca de Xira.

The Grande Área Metropolitana de Lisboa was constituted, by public scripture, in 2004, and published on 5 July 2004, in the III series of the [[Diário da República]]. It is composed by three organs: ·

Junta Metropolitana, executive organ, composed by the 18 presidents of the city halls that it integrates. They elect among themselves, a president and two vice presidents.

Assembleia Metropolitana, legislative organ, composed by the chosen representatives in the municipal assembly of the city halls, in odd number, over the triple the number of the towns that it integrates, in a maximum of 55.

Conselho Metropolitano, consultative organ, composed by representatives of the state and by the members of the Junta Metropolitana.

== Irregularities ==
Portugal has been through a period of administrative changes since the 1974 revolution. More recently, new standards of territorial administration have been implemented to match European Union criteria.

After some years of indefinitions, municipalities are now associated in '''[[Metropolitan areas in Portugal|metropolitan areas]]''' or '''[[Intermunicipal communities of Portugal|intermunicipal communities]]'''.

These new regional divisions are colliding with the traditional Portuguese regional structures: ''Distritos'' (Districts).
Districts were implemented in the 19th century by [[Mouzinho da Silveira]] after the Liberal Revolution, to replace clerical dioceses (which held the intermediate authority between the absolute monarchy and the municipalities), and still are the official regional authorities in Portugal, thus leaving the new metropolitan authorities with no authority at all.
For instance, the District of Lisbon and the District of Setubal collide and interfere with the Lisbon metropolitan area authority.
Each District is ruled by a ''governador civil'' (civil governor). These governors are empowered by the Prime Minister of Portugal and have most of the administrative power over the municipalities comprised, leaving the metropolitan areas with a passive status and communitarian tasks.

To definitely end with these anomalies, a national [[Referendum]] was held on November 8, 1998, in order to approve a new regionalization [http://www.stape.pt/resultref/res_refnac_8nov98_nt.htm (Referendo à Regionalização)], which was rejected by over 60% of the voting population on account of disagreements over the loss of sovereignty of some districts to others (e.g. by the time of the referendum it was not known where would be the seat of government of the new "Estremadura &amp; Ribatejo" region which was a fusion of the District of Leiria with the District of Santarém, being Leiria and Santarém cities of the same size and importance).

Regionalization experiment in Portugal was only successful among insular regions when in 1976, districts of Angra do Heroísmo, Horta and Ponta Delgada were substituted by the Autonomous Region of Açores with seat of government in Ponta Delgada, while district of Funchal was replaced by the Autonomous Region of [[Madeira]] with seat of government in [[Funchal]].

== Portuguese cultural regions ==
Portuguese cultural regions and their limits were officially drawn during the 19th century after slight variations since the foundation of Portugal and still there is no agreement about where one region ends and other starts. Cultural regions in Portugal have symbolic importance and no kind of authority. Once again there is no exact geographical conformity between cultural regions, districts or between any of those and the metropolitan areas.

'''MAC address anonymization''' performs a [[one-way function]] on a [[MAC address]] so that the result may be used in [[tracking system]]s for reporting and the general public, while making it nearly impossible to obtain the original MAC address from the result. The idea is that this process allows companies like [[Google]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://junkee.com/google-maps-has-been-tracking-your-every-move-and-theres-a-website-to-prove-it/39639|title=Google Maps Has Been Tracking Your Every Move, And There's A Website To Prove It|website=Junkee|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/09/28/how-your-iphone-has-been-tracking-your-every-move-in-secret-4884687/ |title=How your iPhone has been tracking your every move in secret &amp;#124; Metro News |website=Metro.co.uk |date=2014-09-28 |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iInside]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-03-10|title=iInside retail brochure: Leading the market in indoor location techno…|url=http://www.slideshare.net/KelliePeterson/iinside-retail-brochure}}&lt;/ref&gt; - which track users movements via computer hardware to simultaneously preserve the identities of the people they are tracking, as well as the hardware itself.

==Examples==
An example of MAC address anonymization would be to use a simple hash algorithm. Given an address of &lt;code&gt;11:22:33:44:55:66&lt;/code&gt;, the [[MD5]] hash algorithm produces &lt;code&gt;eb341820cd3a3485461a61b1e97d31b1&lt;/code&gt; (32 hexadecimal digits).&lt;ref&gt;echo -n "112233445566"|md5sum = eb341820cd3a3485461a61b1e97d31b1&lt;/ref&gt;

An address only one character different (&lt;code&gt;11:22:33:44:55:67&lt;/code&gt;) produces &lt;code&gt;391907146439938c9821856fa181052e&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;echo -n "112233445567"|md5sum = 391907146439938c9821856fa181052e&lt;/ref&gt; an entirely different hash due to the [[avalanche effect]].

==Why this does not work in practice==
Tracking companies rely on the assumption that address anonymization is akin to [[encryption]]. Given a message, and an encryption method that is well known to both the encoder and potential decryptor, modern encryption methods (such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) or [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]]) will yield a result that is unbreakable in practice.

The problem lies in the fact that there are only 2&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt; (281,474,976,710,656) possible MAC addresses. Given the encoding algorithm, an index can easily be created for each possible address.

Several years ago, the building of such an index would have been difficult due to the compute time involved. With modern, [[parallel computing|parallel]], [[cloud computing]], the index generation can be easily divided among the number of processors desired.

On a 2.5&amp;nbsp;GHz processor, a [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] program was able to produce the following results:{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!CPU Count
!Iterations
!Time (seconds)
|-
|1
|2.814 x 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;
|3.0489 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|1,000
|2.814 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;
|3.0489 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|1,000,000
|2.814 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;
|304.89
|}
Thus, a million processors could create the entire index in just over five minutes, and 100,000 processors in less than 85 hours. Once the [[rainbow table]] is complete, conversions of "anonymized" addresses to their actual addresses is almost instantaneous.

==Salting==
{{main|Salt (cryptography)}}
One common way of mitigating such brute force attacks is to append a random [[salt (cryptography)|salt]] into the MAC address before hashing. A salt is a secret string of characters that makes the search space for attackers larger. The effect is that the brute force attack can no longer target the valid range of MAC addresses. Lists of salted and hashed MAC addresses would be impossible to translate, given that the salt is long enough and created in a way that is difficult to guess.

The entity holding the secret salt can still perform deanonymization by attacking the hashed MAC using the technique in the previous chapter. Attackers could also obtain the secret salt through social engineering, phishing or other means.

==Truncating==
Where data protection law requires anonymization, the method used should exclude any possibility of the original MAC address to be identified. Some companies truncate [[IPv4]] addresses by removing the final [[octet (computing)|octet]], thus in effect retaining information about the user's [[ISP]] or [[subnet]], but not directly identifying the individual. The activity could then originate from any of 254 [[IP addresses]]. This may not always be enough to guarantee anonymization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2008/wp148_en.pdf|publisher=ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING PARTY|accessdate=20 October 2017|title=Opinion 1/2008 on data protection issues related to search engines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Moscos Islands Wildlife Sanctuary''' is a demarcated wildlife reserve located in the [[Moscos Islands]], [[Burma]]. It is governed by the Burma Forest Department and the level of protection is total. 

The main purposes of the reserve are [[habitat conservation]] and [[natural resources]] maintenance. The typical habitat is [[tropical evergreen forest]]. Tourists are not allowed within the wildlife reserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banca-env.org/ebook.pdf Myanmar Protected Areas - Context, Current Status and Challenges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417063155/http://www.banca-env.org/ebook.pdf |date=2012-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ngarachamayong Culture Center''' is a [[cultural center]] in [[Koror]], [[Palau]].

==History==
The idea for the establishment of the cultural center originated when a group of visionary women held a special meeting to discuss ways of preserving the culture and tradition of the Palauan people. The meeting led to the establishment of a series of Mechesil Belau Conferences. During these conferences the idea to establish a cultural center was born. Subsequently, the Ngarachamayong, Inc. was incorporated. The cultural center was then constructed with funding from the [[Politics of Palau|Government of Palau]] and the [[Government of the Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="oceanislandtravel.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceanislandtravel.com/home.asp?aid=136|title=Ngarachamayong Culture Center|website=Ocean Island Travel|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
The cultural center exhibits the people and culture of the Palauan people.&lt;ref name="oceanislandtravel.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13643">'''Pialrâl''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|iː|əl|ˈ|r|ɑː|l}}) is the ultimate [[heaven]] according to the [[folk myth]] of the [[mizo people|Mizo tribes]] of [[Northeast India]]. The [[Mizo language|Mizo]] word literally means "beyond the world". Unlike most concepts of heaven, it is not the final [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|resting place of the spirits]] of the good and the righteous, nor there is a role for [[god]] or any [[supernatural]]s, but is simply a reservation for extraordinary achievers during their lifetime to enjoy eternal bliss and luxury.&lt;ref name=shake&gt;{{cite book|author= Shakespear J |title= The Lushei-Kuki Clans |year= 2004|origyear= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AvoTpz_rtmIC&amp;q |pages=62–64 |ISBN =8187502843 |publisher= Spectrum Publications, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bar&gt;{{cite book |author=Baral KC |editors = Biswas P, Thomas CJ |title=Construction of Evil in North East India: Myth, Narrative and Discourse |publisher=Sage Publications India Pvt Ltd, New Delhi, India |year=2012 |origyear=|pages=36–45 |chapter=Chapter 4: The Discourse of Evil and the Mizo Folk Imagination |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpNwHeuOfToC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=pialral&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tf14Ueq9BoGJrAeV3YCgCw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=pialral&amp;f=false |isbn=8132109457 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''Pialrâl'' itself sums up very well the entire [[Supernatural|spiritual]] belief system in the [[animism|animistic]] [[folk religion]] of the Mizo ancestors. It encompasses not only the spiritual realm, but also all the pathways for entry and services required to attain access. Although the traditional Mizo religion had been completely overshadowed by [[Christianity]] since the turn of the 20th century, the notion of ''Pialrâl'' still survives as a remnant in a Christian [[metaphor]] of [[paradise]] among modern Mizos, especially vivid in their [[gospel music|songs of praise]].&lt;ref name=strom&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strom D |year=1980 |title= Christianity and culture change among the Mizoram| url= http://mis.sagepub.com/content/8/3/307.full.pdf+html | journal= Missiology |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages= 307–317|doi= 10.1177/009182968000800304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Lalfakzuala |title=  Mizote Pathian Thu (Lal Sut Vuan) |language=Mizo |trans-title=Beliefs of the Mizos (submission to the chief) |date= 21 November 2010 |url= http://www.misual.com/2010/11/21/mizote-pathian-thu-lal-sut-vuan/| work=mi(sual).com|publisher= |accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophy==

The Mizo ancestors believed in the existence of [[soul]] in two worlds beyond life, namely ''Mitthi Khua'' (literal translation: "land of the dead") and the higher abode ''Pialral''. It is every human soul's destiny to go to ''Mitthi Khua'', where most would end up eternally, but there is ''Pialral'' at the farther realm that is only for the select few.

==Passport to ''Pialrâl''==

Earning the title of ''thangchhuah'' is the most prestigious honour in the Mizo life and the only sure route to ''Pialrâl'' after death, and to achieve it is no small measure. By the estimate of the achievements imposed, ''Pialrâl'' is clearly an under-populated place. There are two ways by which one can accomplish the deed for being a ''thangchhuah'',&lt;ref name=sha&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Thirumal P, Lalrozami C |year=2010 |title= On the discursive and material context of the first handwritten Lushai newspaper ‘Mizo Chanchin Laishuih’, 1898 | jstor=2843210 | journal= Indian Economic Social History Review |volume=47|issue=3 |pages=377–403|doi=10.1177/001946461004700304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Parry NE |title= Lushai Custom: A Monograph on Lushai Customs and Ceremonies |year= 1928 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZsJAQAAIAAJ&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_r&amp;cad=3 |pages=96–98  |ISBN = |publisher= Firma KLM Private Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nunthara C  |title= Mizoram: Society and Polity |year=1996 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Jksn3c85KOkC&amp;dq |page=99 |ISBN = 8173870594 |publisher=Indus Publishing Company, New Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=josh&gt;{{cite book|author= Joshi HG  |title= Mizoram: Past and Present|year=2005|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YtX52F_qcWgC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=thangchhuah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nqt7UYWDOsbHrQfw2YGgDw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=thangchhuah&amp;f=false|pages=56–59 |ISBN = 8170999979 |publisher=Mittal Publications, New Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=josh&gt;{{cite book|author= Zorema J  |title= Indirect Rule In Mizoram 1890-1954 |year=2007|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BYwpt38dYIIC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=thangchhuah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nqt7UYWDOsbHrQfw2YGgDw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=thangchhuah&amp;f=false|page=13 |ISBN = 8183242294 |publisher=Mittal Publications, New Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
namely
# The first called ''ram lama thangchhuah'' (that is by [[hunting]] exploits) which mandates slaying of at least one enemy and a horde of wild animals, including [[elephant]], [[bear]], [[wild boar]], [[gaur]], [[sambar deer]] and [[barking deer]]. The bonus kill includes [[king cobra]], [[crested serpent eagle]] and [[flying squirrel]], for the greater glory.  In addition, there is a lesser daunting task, which is to sleep with a [[virgin]].
# The other called ''in lama thangchhuah'' (that is by domestic deeds) which involves a massively lavish and extravagant [[ritual]]. The event is called ''khuangchawi'' (meaning "[[festival]]" or "celebration") which could only be afforded by the richest people, even by a few [[tribal chief|chiefs]], and should at least last four days. The first day is preparatory involving repair of the host's house, preparation of [[wine]], and milling rice, with an evening dance by all youngsters of the village. The second day is a wine-drinking day, and killing of [[domestic pig|pigs]], of which a boar is for [[Banquet|feast]] of the boys and two [[suidae|sow]]s for [[sacrifice]]. The third day is a grand feast for the entire village, and men are expected to get drunk; a bison is used for the feast and a sow is also sacrificed by the best friend. The final day is again a feast day, but mostly of close kith and kin, and the day closes with an evening dance where all the youngsters participated. A concluding feast for all villagers is again necessary, but it can be organised at any convenient time of the year.

The distinctive entitlement of an accomplished ''thangchhuah'' family in the village was that they had an open window (no other house ever had a window).&lt;ref name=josh/&gt;

==Journey to ''Pialrâl''==

When a person dies, as the Mizo believed, the spirit immediately emanates from the body, but does not go directly to ''Mithi Khua''. Instead it roams around until a favourable season, generally after the wet [[monsoon]], around the month of August (in fact August is still traditionally named ''Thiṭin Thla'', meaning "month of the spirit departure").&lt;ref name=lalh/&gt; The bereaved family then prepare ''thlaichhiah'', a ceremony involving animal sacrifice, so that the very spirit of the slain animal will provide and guide on the way. For example, the most commonly used were [[pig]] and [[dog]] – pig for the [[meat]] and dog to guide.&lt;ref name=shake/&gt;&lt;ref name=dev&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Dev BJ, Lahiri DK |year=1983 |title= Lushai Customs and Ceremonies | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUXEh5V0K58C&amp;dq | publisher=Mittal Publications |location=Delhi, India |pages=80, 99|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanlallawma&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vanlallawma|first=C.|title=Mizos and the After-life|journal=Indian Folklife|date=2009|volume=34|pages=6–7|url=http://indianfolklore.org/journals/index.php/IFL/article/download/734/929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barriers and crossings===

According to the myth, the spirit heads towards the east onwards to a lake called ''[[Rih dïl|Rih Dil]]'' (a real lake in western [[Burma]]). After crossing the lake, the spirit reaches a hill called ''Hringlang Tlâng'', meaning the "hill from where mortals are visible".  On this hill is a special [[spring (hydrology)|spring)]], the water of which erases mortal memories, hence called "Lungloh Tui" ("water of no more sorrow"). After drinking the water, the spirit plucks the nearby flower called ''Hawilo Pâr'' (which means "flower of no looking back") and tucks it to the hair behind the ears. This finally takes away all mortal feelings and worldly longings.&lt;ref name=sha/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanlallawma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Rosanga JH |title=  Hringlang tlang khawiah nge?|language=Mizo |trans-title=Where is Hringlang Tlang|date= 24 July 2010 |url= http://www.vanglaini.org/articles/4656-hringlang-tlang-khawiah-nge| work=Vanglaini|publisher= |accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pâwla===

Then the spirit has to confront a physical test just before entering ''Mitthi Khua'' which is a [[slingshot]] by a formidable guard named Pâwla. Pâwla is the only supernatural person in the Mizo mythology of afterlife. He is the first human to have died, and he would shoot at all the rank-and-file spirit so that they are doomed to settle in ''Mitthi Khua'' and nowhere else. His pellets were so huge that whoever he shot at could be crippled up to three years. However, there are three groups whom Pâwla never shoot at: firstly, the ''thangchhuah'' personnel; secondly, a young man who had slept either with three virgins or seven women; lastly, an [[infant]] below age.&lt;ref name=sha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Tochhawng R, Lalrinmawia K, Rawsea LH |year=2007 |title= Ground Works for Tribal Theology in the Mizo Context| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltPYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q | publisher=ISPCK  |location=University of Michigan, USA |pages=145 |isbn=8172149719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The case of infants===

The death of an infant before reaching an age is called ''hlamzuih'' (''hlam'' meaning "[[placenta]]", and ''zuih'' meaning "failure" or "end") and was treated differently, rather casually.  The infant corpse would be stuffed in an [[earthenware|earthen pot]], along with a hard-boiled egg and a [[porcupine]] [[spine (zoology)|quill]], and be buried near or under the house. The mother's milk soaked in cotton and a pinch of rice in one hand would be all the food pack required for	 the journey. The egg was a device for [[navigation]] for the otherwise unaware baby and would be expected to roll all the way to ''Mitthi Khua''; and the quill as a weapon of defense.&lt;ref name=shake/&gt;&lt;ref name=dev/&gt;

===The triumphant entry===

For the ''thangchhuah'' [[laureate]] there is no stopping by Pâwla or at the ''Mitthi Khua'', for there is another crossing of a river called ''Pial'', which demarcates the limit of the ''Mitthi Khua''. For the honoured one, ''Pial'' is no obstacle. The domestic ''thangchhuah'' would be certified by all his sacrifices of pigs and bison. As for the hunter ''thangchhuah'', he would sit on the head of his slain barking deer, holding its [[horn (anatomy)|horns]]; the cobra would coil around him to the horn. The eagle leading the way while screaming, and the flying lemur shading him from above. These are the benefits of the bonus kills. The other animals would trail behind as his trophies and prized possession, to the land of unbridled comfort and luxury.&lt;ref name=shake/&gt;&lt;ref name=bar/&gt;&lt;ref name=josh/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10813">{{Environmental law}}
In [[environmental law]], the '''polluter pays principle''' is enacted to make the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]]. It is regarded as a regional custom because of the strong support it has received in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Union]] countries. It is a fundamental principle in US environmental law.

== History ==
According to the French [[historian of the environment]] Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, [[financial compensation]] (not named "polluter pays principle" at that time) is already the regulation principle of [[Industrial pollution|pollution]] favoured by industrials in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Ulmi&gt;{{fr}} Nic Ulmi, [https://www.letemps.ch/sciences/2016/10/18/aux-origines-crise-ecologique "Aux origines de la crise écologique"] [The origins of the ecological crisis], ''[[Le temps]]'', 18 October 2016 (page visited on 22 October 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that: "This principle, which is now offered as a new solution, actually accompanied the process of industrialisation, and was intended by the manufacturers themselves."&lt;ref name=Ulmi/&gt;

== Applications in environmental law==
The polluter pays principle underpins environmental policy such as an [[ecotax]], which, if enacted by government, deters and essentially reduces [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. This principle is based on the fact that as much as pollution is unavoidable, the person or industry that is responsible for the pollution must pay some money for the rehabilitation of the polluted environment.

===Australia===
The state of [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]] has included the polluter pay principle with the other principles of [[ecologically sustainable development]] in the objectives of the Environment Protection Authority.&lt;ref&gt;Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991, section 6(2)(d)(i)[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poteaa1991485/s6.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The polluter pays principle is set out in the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] &lt;ref&gt;Article 191(2) TFEU&lt;/ref&gt; and Directive 2004/35/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage is based on this principle. The directive entered into force on 30 April 2004; member states were allowed three years to transpose the [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] into their domestic law and by July 2010 all member states had completed this.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/legal/liability/ Environmental Liability], accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== France ===
In France, the Charter for the Environment contains a formulation of the polluter pays principle (article 4):
{{Block quote|Everyone shall be required, in the conditions provided for by law, to contribute to the making good of any damage he or she may have caused to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/charter_environnement.pdf ''Charter for the Environment''], [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] (page visited on 28 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ghana===
In [[Ghana]], the polluter pays principle was adopted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Ghana Business News, [https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2011/12/08/cabinet-approves-polluter-pays-principle/ Cabinet approves Polluter Pays Principle], 8 December 2011, accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
The polluter pays principle is also known as '''extended producer responsibility''' (EPR). This is a concept that was probably first described by Thomas Lindhqvist for the [[Swedish government]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;The International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University, Sweden (2000).[http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf "Extended Producer Responsibility in Cleaner Production"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513010736/http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf |date=2014-05-13 }} Doctoral Dissertation (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; EPR seeks to shift the responsibility of dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it internalised the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically meaning that the producers will improve the waste profile of their products, thus decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines extended producer responsibility as: &lt;blockquote&gt;
a concept where manufacturers and importers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products throughout the product life-cycle, including upstream impacts inherent in the selection of materials for the products, impacts from manufacturers’ production process itself, and downstream impacts from the use and disposal of the products. Producers accept their responsibility when designing their products to minimise life-cycle environmental impacts, and when accepting legal, physical or socio-economic responsibility for environmental impacts that cannot be eliminated by design.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Environment Directorate, Paris, France (2006).[http://www.oecd.org/document/53/0,3343,en_2649_34395_37284725_1_1_1_1,00.html "Extended Producer Responsibility."] Project Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The [[waste management in Switzerland]] is based on the polluter pays principle.&lt;ref name=Skjellaug/&gt; [[Bin bag]]s (for [[municipal solid waste]]) are taxed with [[Pay as you throw|pay-per-bag fees]] in three quarters of the [[Municipalities of Switzerland|communes]] (and the recycling rate doubled in twenty years).&lt;ref name=Skjellaug&gt;{{fr}} Aïna Skjellaug, [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/09/06/lautre-or-suisse-dechets "L’autre or de la Suisse, ses déchets"], ''[[Le temps]]'', Tuesday 6 September 2016 (page visited on 6 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009 (for England) and the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) (Wales) Regulations 2009 (for Wales) established the operation of the polluter pays principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402182915/http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/policy/liability/pdf/quick-guide-regs09.pdf The Environmental Damage Regulations: Preventing and Remedying Environmental Damage], accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The principle is employed in all of the major US pollution control laws: [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/air-enforcement |title=Air Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-01 |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clean Water Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/water-enforcement |title=Water Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-14 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (solid waste and hazardous waste management),&lt;ref name="EPA-waste"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/waste-chemical-and-cleanup-enforcement |title=Waste, Chemical, and Cleanup Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-07 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Superfund]] (cleanup of abandoned waste sites).&lt;ref name="EPA-waste"/&gt;

Some eco-taxes underpinned by the polluter pays principle include:
* the [[Gas Guzzler Tax]] for motor vehicles
* [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE), a "polluter pays" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]].
* the Superfund law requires polluters to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste sites, when the polluters can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=June 1996 |title=The Buck Stops Here: Polluters are Paying for Most Hazardous Waste Cleanups |periodical=Superfund Today (newsletter) |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=10001XKT.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-540-K-96/004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, an [[Polluter pays amendment|amendment]] was passed negating the "polluter pays" provision of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]].

====Limitations of polluter pays principle====
The US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has observed that the polluter pays principle has typically not been fully implemented in [[United States environmental law|US laws]] and programs. For example, [[water purification|drinking water]] and [[sewage treatment]] services are [[subsidy|subsidized]] and there are limited mechanisms in place to fully assess polluters for treatment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2003 |title=Water and Wastewater Pricing: An Informational Overview |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/901U1200.PDF?Dockey=901U1200.PDF |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-832-F-03-027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe===
The [[Zimbabwe]] Environmental Management Act of 2002 &lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.kubatana.net/docs/legisl/env_mgmt_act_060325.pdf Chapter 20:27]&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the environment. In line with the "Polluter Pays" principle, the Act requires a polluter to meet the cost of decontaminating the polluted environment.&lt;ref&gt;The Herald (Harare), [http://www.herald.co.zw/polluter-pays-as-environmental-management-principle/ Polluter pays as environmental management principle], 18 May 2016, accessed 6 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==In international environmental law==
In [[international environmental law]] it is mentioned in the principle 16 of the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]] of 1992.

'''''Pourquoi Pas?'' IV ''' was the fourth ship built for [[Jean-Baptiste Charcot]]. She completed the second Charcot expedition of the Antarctic regions from 1908 to 1910. Charcot died aboard when she was wrecked on 16 September 1936, off the coast of [[Iceland]]. Of the forty men on board, only one survived.

==History==
In 1907, [[Jean-Baptiste Charcot]] launched a new Antarctic expedition and began work on a new ship, ''Pourquoi-Pas?'' IV, a three-masted [[barque]] designed for polar exploration, equipped with a motor and containing three laboratories and a library.  It was built at [[Saint-Malo]] to plans by Francois Gautier, in his shipyard.

From 1908 to 1910, Charcot set out in ''Pourquoi-Pas ?'' IV, wintering at [[Petermann Island]], on his second polar expedition. He returned to France in 1910 laden with scientific discoveries - he had finished the mapping of [[Alexander Island]] and discovered a new island, [[Charcot Island|Charcot Land]].

In 1912, ''Pourquoi-Pas ?'' IV became the French Navy's first [[school ship]].  From 1918 to 1925, Charcot took ''Pourquoi-Pas ?'' IV on various scientific missions in the North Atlantic, the English Channel, the Mediterranean and the [[Faroe Islands]], mainly to study underwater [[lithology]] and [[geology]] by means of drag nets, to whose material and use Charcot made major improvements.

From 1925 onwards, limited by age, Charcot lost command of the ship (though he remained on board as head of the expedition) for her many voyages around the Arctic glaciers.  In 1926, Charcot and ''Pourquoi-Pas ?'' IV explored the eastern coast of [[Greenland]] and brought back many fossils and samples of insects and flora.

In 1928, ''Pourquoi-Pas ?'' IV set out to investigate the disappearance of the large French [[seaplane]] ''[[Latham 47]]'' with the Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] on board, which had itself been looking for the Italian general [[Umberto Nobile]], who had set out to cross the North Pole in the dirigible ''Italia'' and not been heard from since.

In 1934, Charcot and ''Pourquoi-Pas ?'' IV set up an ethnographic mission in Greenland headed by [[Paul-Émile Victor]], who spent a year in [[Tasiilaq|Angmagssalik]] living amid the [[Eskimo]] population.  In 1935, Charcot and ''Pourquoi-Pas ?'' IV returned there to look for Victor and his three companions (Gessain, Pérez et Matter) and began the mapping of these regions.  On 16 September that year, the ship managed to reach a small port to escape a [[cyclone]] which ravaged the coasts of Iceland.

In September 1936, returning from the mission to Greenland to deliver scientific material to Victor's mission (which had just traversed the [[ice sheet]]s in 50 days) and after carrying out a survey mission, ''Pourquoi-Pas ?'' IV stopped at [[Reykjavík]] to re-provision with fuel on 13 September.  They set out for [[Saint-Malo]] two days later, on 15 September, but on 16 September the ship was caught in a violent cyclonic storm and lost on the reefs of [[Álftanes]] at [[Mýrar]].  23 of the crew were lost in the wreck and 17 survivors died before rescue came, leaving only one survivor, Eugène Gonidec, master steersman. [[Jean-Baptiste Charcot]] was one of the dead, aged 69. [[Pourquoi Pas Point]] and [[Pourquoi Pas Island]] were later named after it.

There are at least six types of '''protected areas of the [[Czech Republic]]'''.

== Specially Protected Areas ==

=== National Park ===

'''National park''' ({{lang-cs|národní park}}, abbreviated as ''NP'') is a large area whose considerable part consists of natural ecosystems or ecosystems little affected by human activities in which the [[abiotic]] features, [[flora]] and [[fauna]] have unique scientific and educational importance on an international or national level. They are established by both Chambers of the Czech Parliament. As of 2007 there are 4 national parks in the Czech Republic (with year of establishment and area in brackets):

[[File:Typhoon MyGuide 3500 mobile - GPS module - SiRF GSP2e LP-7451-92278.jpg|thumb|SiRF Ii chip]]
'''SiRF Technology, Inc.''' was a pioneer in the commercial use of [[GPS]] technology for consumer applications. The company was founded in 1995 and was headquartered in [[San Jose, California]]. The company was acquired by British firm [[CSR plc]] in 2009, who were in turn subsequently acquired by American company [[Qualcomm]] on 13 August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://gpsworld.com/qualcomm-to-acquire-sirf-chipmaker-csr/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csr.com/our-company/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

SiRF manufactured a range of patented [[GPS]] chipsets and software for consumer navigation devices and systems.  The chips are based on [[ARM architecture|ARM]] controllers integrated with low-noise radio receivers to decode GPS signals at very low signal levels (typically -160[[dBm]]). SiRF chips also support [[SBAS]] to allow for differentially corrected positions.

== SiRFstarIII ==
{{main|SiRFstarIII}}
SiRFstarIII architecture is designed to be useful in wireless and handheld [[location-based services]] (LBS) applications, for 2G, 2.5G, 3G asynchronous networks. The SiRFstarIII family comprises the GRF3w RF IC, the GSP3f digital section, and the GSW3 software that is API compatible with GSW2 and SiRFLoc. The chips have been adopted by major GPS manufacturers, including Sony, Micro Technologies, Garmin, TomTom and Magellan.

== SiRFatLas IV ==
SiRFatLas IV is a multifunction location system processor and is meant for entry-level Personal Navigation Devices (PNDs). The SiRFatLas IV is a cheaper version of the very popular, but rather expensive SiRFPrima platform.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brighthub.com/electronics/gps/articles/38915.aspx – GPS Chipsets: SiRFatLas IV is Coming to a PND Near You&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpsbusinessnews.com/SiRFatlasIV-unveiled-low-cost-GPS-and-multifunction-processor_a1573.html – SiRFatlasIV unveiled: low cost GPS and multifunction processor&lt;/ref&gt; Has GPS/Galileo baseband, LCD touch-screen controller, video input, 10-bit ADC and a high-speed USB 2.0.

== SiRFstarV ==
SiRFstarV chips are capable of tracking [[Global Positioning System|NAVSTAR]], [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], [[Beidou navigation system|Compass]], [[SBAS]], and future GNSS signals.  The SiRFusion platform integrates positioning from GNSS, terrestrial radio solutions such as Wi-Fi and cellular, and MEMS sensors including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and compasses.  SiRFusion can then combine this real-time information with cellular base station and Wi-Fi access point location data, ephemeribased aiding information from the CSR Positioning Center (CPC) to generate accurate and reliable position updates.

== Acquisition ==
On 10 February 2009, UK wireless chip company [[CSR plc|CSR]] announced it was buying SiRF in a share deal worth $136 million.&lt;ref name="Merger"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ir.csr.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=177117&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1254803 |title=CSR purchase announcement |publisher=CSR |accessdate=2009-04-17}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strabo'''&lt;ref group="n"&gt;''Strabo'' (meaning "squinty", as in [[strabismus]]) was a term employed by the Romans for anyone whose eyes were distorted or deformed. The father of [[Pompey]] was called "[[Pompeius Strabo]]". A native of Sicily so clear-sighted that he could see things at great distance as if they were nearby was also called "Strabo."&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|r|eɪ|b|oʊ}}; {{lang-el|Στράβων}} ''Strábōn''; 64 or 63 BC{{snd}}{{circa|lk=no}}&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;24) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[geography|geographer]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], and [[historian]] who lived in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] during the transitional period of the [[Roman Republic]] into the [[Roman Empire]].

Strabo was born to an affluent family from [[Amasya|Amaseia]] in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] (in present-day [[Turkey]]) in around 64{{nbsp}}BC.&lt;ref name="Purcell2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Purcell|first=Nicholas|editor1-first=Simon |editor1-last=Hornblower|editor2-first=Antony |editor2-last=Spawforth|editor3-first= Esther |editor3-last=Eidinow|title=The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIgdBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA757|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-870677-9|page=757|chapter=Strabo|chapterurl = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198706779.001.0001/acref-9780198706779-e-602}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family had been involved in politics since at least the reign of [[Mithridates V]].&lt;ref name="BianchettiCataudella2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bianchetti|first1=Serena |last2=Cataudella|first2=Michele |last3=Gehrke|first3=Hans-Joachim |title=Brill's Companion to Ancient Geography: The Inhabited World in Greek and Roman Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=to8DCwAAQBAJ|date=4 December 2015|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-28471-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo was related to [[Dorylaeus]] on his mother's side. Several other family members, including his paternal grandfather had served [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates&amp;nbsp;VI]] during the [[Mithridatic Wars]]. As the war drew to a close, Strabo's grandfather had turned several [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] fortresses over to the Romans.&lt;ref name="Mayor2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrienne Mayor|title=The Poison King: The Life and Legend of Mithradates, Rome's Deadliest Enemy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKnFZa4LNjQC&amp;pg=PR9|date=March 2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-15026-5|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo wrote that "great promises were made in exchange for these services", and as [[Persian Empire|Persian]] culture endured in Amasia even after Mithridates and [[Tigranes the Great#Wars against Rome|Tigranes]] were defeated, scholars have speculated about how the family's support for Rome might have affected their position in the local community, and whether they might have been granted Roman citizenship as a reward.&lt;ref name="BianchettiCataudella2015" /&gt;

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 094r 1.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Strabo as depicted in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]]]

Strabo's life was characterized by extensive travels. He journeyed to [[Egypt]] and [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], as far west as coastal [[Tuscany]] and as far south as [[Ethiopia]] in addition to his travels in [[Asia Minor]] and the time he spent in [[Rome]]. Travel throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, especially for scholarly purposes, was popular during this era and was facilitated by the [[Pax Romana|relative peace]] enjoyed throughout the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC – AD&amp;nbsp;14). He moved to Rome in 44&amp;nbsp;BC, and stayed there, studying and writing, until at least 31&amp;nbsp;BC. In 29&amp;nbsp;BC, on his way to [[Corinth]] (where Augustus was at the time), he visited the island of [[Gyaros]] in the Aegean Sea. Around 25&amp;nbsp;BC, he sailed up the [[Nile]] until reaching [[Philae]],&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Accompanied by prefect of Egypt Aelius Gallus, who had been sent on a military mission to Arabia.&lt;/ref&gt; after which point there is little record of his proceedings until AD 17.

It is not known precisely when Strabo's ''Geography'' was written, though comments within the work itself place the finished version within the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]]. Some place its first drafts around 7&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name="StraboGeogI"&gt;{{cite book|author=Strabo|translator=Horace Leonard Jones|url=https://archive.org/stream/L049StraboGeographyI/L049-Strabo%20Geography%20I#page/n23 |title=Geography|publisher= William Heinemann|location= London|date= 1917|p= xxv-xxvi|volume=Vol. I}}&lt;/ref&gt; others around AD&amp;nbsp;17&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Pothecary, ''[http://www.strabo.ca/when.html When was the Geography written?]''&lt;/ref&gt; or 18.&lt;ref name="StraboGeogI" /&gt; The latest passage to which a date can be assigned is his reference to the death in AD&amp;nbsp;23 of [[Juba&amp;nbsp;II]], king of Maurousia ([[Mauretania]]), who is said to have died "just recently".&lt;ref name="StraboGeogVIII" /&gt; He probably worked on the ''Geography'' for many years and revised it steadily, not always consistently. It is an encyclopaedical chronicle and consists of political, economic, social, cultural, geographic description of almost whole Europe: British Isles, Iberian Peninsula, Gaul, Germania, The Alps, Italy, Greece; and Northern Black Sea region, Anatolia, Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa. The ''Geography'' is the only extant work providing information about both Greek and Roman peoples and countries during the reign of Augustus.&lt;ref name="LCL"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Strabo, Geography, Volume I: Books 1-2 |author= |work=Loeb Classical Library |date=n.d. |access-date=8 September 2018 |url= https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL049/1917/volume.xml |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the presumption that "recently" means within a year, Strabo stopped writing that year or the next (AD&amp;nbsp;24&amp;nbsp;), when he died.
He was influenced by [[Homer]], [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Strabo#ref279367&lt;/ref&gt; The first of Strabo's major works, ''Historical Sketches'' (''Historica hypomnemata''), written while he was in Rome (c. 20&amp;nbsp;BC), is nearly completely lost. Meant to cover the history of the known world from the conquest of Greece by the Romans, Strabo quotes it himself and other classical authors mention that it existed, although the only surviving document is a fragment of papyrus now in possession of the [[University of Milan]] (renumbered [Papyrus]&amp;nbsp;46).

==Education==

Strabo studied under several prominent teachers of various specialties throughout his early life&lt;ref group="n"&gt;He mentions all or most of his teachers as prominent citizens of their own respective cities.&lt;/ref&gt; at different stops along his Mediterranean travels. His first chapter of education took place in [[Nysa on the Maeander|Nysa]] (modern [[Sultanhisar]], Turkey) under the master of rhetoric [[Aristodemos of Nysa the Younger|Aristodemus]], who had formerly taught the sons of the very same Roman general who had taken over Pontus.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;This also highlights the international trend of the era that Greek intellectuals would often instruct the Roman elite.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristodemus was the head of two schools of rhetoric and grammar, one in Nysa and one in [[Rhodes]], the former of the two cities possessing a distinct intellectual curiosity of Homeric literature and the interpretation of epics. Strabo was an admirer of [[Homer]]'s poetry, perhaps a consequence of his time spent in Nysa with Aristodemus.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Aristodemus was also the grandson of the famous [[Posidonius]], whose influence is manifest in Strabo's ''Geography''.&lt;/ref&gt;

At around the age of 21, Strabo moved to Rome, where he studied philosophy with the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] [[Xenarchus]], a highly respected tutor in Augustus's court. Despite Xenarchus's Aristotelian leanings, Strabo later gives evidence to have formed his own [[Stoicism|Stoic]] inclinations.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Largely due to his future teacher Athenodorus, tutor of [[Augustus]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, he also learned grammar under the rich and famous scholar [[Tyrannion of Amisus]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Thus completing his traditional Greek aristocratic education in rhetoric, grammar, and philosophy. Tyrannion was known to have befriended Cicero and taught his nephew, Quintus.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Tyrannion was also a Peripatetic, he was more relevantly a respected authority on geography, a fact obviously significant, considering Strabo's future contributions to the field.

The final noteworthy mentor to Strabo was [[Athenodorus Cananites]], a philosopher who had spent his life since 44&amp;nbsp;BC in Rome forging relationships with the Roman elite. Athenodorus endowed to Strabo three important items: his philosophy, his knowledge, and his contacts. Unlike the Aristotelian Xenarchus and Tyrannion who preceded him in teaching Strabo, Athenodorus was Stoic in mindset, almost certainly the source of Strabo's diversion from the philosophy of his former mentors. Moreover, from his own first-hand experience, Athenodorus provided Strabo with information about regions of the empire which he would not otherwise have known.

==''Geographica''==
{{Main|Geographica}}
[[File:C+B-Geography-Map1-StrabosMap.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of the world according to Strabo.]]

Strabo is most notable for his work ''Geographica'' ("Geography"), which presented a descriptive history of people and places from different regions of the world known to his era.&lt;ref name="StraboGeogVIII" /&gt;

[[File:Map of Europe according to Strabo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of Europe according to Strabo.]]

Although the ''Geographica'' was rarely utilized in its contemporary antiquity, a multitude of copies survived throughout the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It first appeared in Western Europe in Rome as a Latin translation issued around 1469. The first Greek edition was published in 1516 in [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;Geographie, Band 1, Strabo, S.17, Strabo, Karl Kärcher, Gottlieb Lukas Friedrich Tafel, Christian Nathanael Osiander, Gustav Schwab, Verlag Metzler, 1831.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Casaubon]], classical scholar and editor of Greek texts, provided the first critical edition in 1587.

Although Strabo cited the antique Greek astronomers [[Eratosthenes]] and [[Hipparchus]], acknowledging their astronomical and mathematical efforts towards geography, he claimed that a descriptive approach was more practical, such that his works were designed for statesmen who were more anthropologically than numerically concerned with the character of countries and regions.

As such, ''[[Geographica]]'' provides a valuable source of information on the ancient world, especially when this information is corroborated by other sources. He traveled extensively, as he says: "Westward I have journeyed to the parts of Etruria opposite Sardinia; towards the south from the Euxine to the borders of Ethiopia; and perhaps not one of those who have written geographies has visited more places than I have between those limits."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nndb.com/people/156/000097862/&lt;/ref&gt;  We do not know when he wrote ''Geographica'', but we know that he spent a lot of time in the famous library taking notes from his sources and his "the works of his predecessors" are most likely to have been noted at the library there. A first edition was published in 7 BC and a final edition no later than 23 AD, in the last year of Strabo's life. ''Geographica'', unfortunately, had an infinitesimal influence in his lifetime. It took about five years for scholars to give him a credit and for it to become a standard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enotes.com/topics/strabo/critical-essays#critical-essays-introduction&lt;/ref&gt;
In his last book of ''Geographica'', he wrote quite extensively about the thriving port city of Alexandria. He emphasized that the harbor was well-encompassed by the embankments and that the shore was so deep-watered that even the largest ships could traverse. These ships were sent out to India, Ethiopia to supply them with products. Strabo juxtaposes Dichaiarchia (Naples, one of the largest ports in Europe) and Alexandria ports and says that the ships in Alexandria were clearly bigger. Thus, freight transporting and shipping were essential to foreign trade in products from all over the world, suggesting a highly developed local economy at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, Geography 17.1.6, 7, 8, 13; translated by Brent Shaw.Attained from: E.A. Pollard, C. Rosenberg, and R.L. Tignor, et al. Worlds Together, Worlds Apart, Concise, Volume One: Beginnings through the Fifteenth Century (W.W. Norton, 2015) Pg. 228&lt;/ref&gt;
Strabo also describes the city itself. According to him, there were a lot of beautiful public parks and the city was reticulated with perfectly designed streets that were wide enough for chariots and horsemen. "Two of these are exceeding broad, over a plethron in breadth, and cut one another at right angles ... All the buildings are connected one with another, and these also with what are beyond it."&lt;ref name="Davis1912"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=William Stearns |authorlink=William Stearns Davis|title=Reading in Ancient History: |url=https://archive.org/stream/readingsinancie01davigoog#page/n346/search/alexandria|volume=Vol. I: Greece and the East|year=1912|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston|pp=325-329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the architecture was also developed in Egypt.

Strabo is pro-Roman politically, but culturally he reserves primacy to Greece:&lt;ref name="Kim2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Lawrence |title=Homer between History and Fiction in Imperial Greek Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7Bg3zRom6QC&amp;pg=PA83|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49024-5|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; "... pro-Roman throughout the Geography. But while he acknowledges and even praises Roman ascendancy in the political and military sphere, he also makes a significant effort to establish Greek primacy over Rome in other contexts."

In [[India]], Strabo described small flying reptiles that were {{convert|90|cm}} long with a snake-like body and bat-like wings. Other historians, such as [[Herodotus]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]], mentioned similar creatures.

==Geology==
As quoted from [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Strabo... enters largely, in the Second Book of his ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'', into the opinions of [[Eratosthenes]] and other Greeks on one of the most difficult problems in geology, ''viz''., by what causes marine shells came to be plentifully buried in the earth at such great elevations and distances from the sea.

He notices, amongst others, the explanation of [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]] the Lydian, who said that the seas had once been more extensive, and that they had afterwards been partially dried up, as in his own time many lakes, rivers, and wells in Asia had failed during a season of drought. Treating this conjecture with merited disregard, Strabo passes on to the hypothesis of [[Strato of Lampsacus|Strato]], the natural philosopher, who had observed that the quantity of mud brought down by rivers into the Euxine was so great, that its bed must be gradually raised, while the rivers still continued to pour in an undiminished quantity of water. He therefore conceived that, originally, when the Euxine was an inland sea, its level had by this means become so much elevated that it burst its barrier near Byzantium, and formed a communication with the Propontis, and this partial drainage had already, he supposed, converted the left side into marshy ground, and that, at last, the whole would be choked up with soil. So, it was argued, the Mediterranean had once opened a passage for itself by the Columns of Hercules into the Atlantic, and perhaps the abundance of sea-shells in Africa, near the Temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)#Syncretic or geographical epithets|Jupiter]] [[Amun|Ammon]], might also be the deposit of some former inland sea, which had at length forced a passage and escaped.

But Strabo rejects this theory as insufficient to account for all the phenomena, and he proposes one of his own, the profoundness of which modern geologists are only beginning to appreciate. 'It is not,' he says, 'because the lands covered by seas were originally at different altitudes, that the waters have risen, or subsided, or receded from some parts and inundated others. But the reason is, that the same land is sometimes raised up and sometimes depressed, and the sea also is simultaneously raised and depressed so that it either overflows or returns into its own place again. We must, therefore, ascribe the cause to the ground, either to that ground which is under the sea, or to that which becomes flooded by it, but rather to that which lies beneath the sea, for this is more moveable, and, on account of its humidity, can be altered with great celerity. It is proper,' he observes in continuation, '''to derive our explanations from things which are obvious, and in some measure of daily occurrences, such as deluges, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and sudden swellings of the land beneath the sea;'' for the last raise up the sea also, and when the same lands subside again, they occasion the sea to be let down. And it is not merely the small, but the large islands also, and not merely the islands, but the continents, which can be lifted up together with the sea; and both large and small tracts may subside, for habitations and cities, like Bure, Bizona, and many others, have been engulfed by earthquakes.'

In another place, this learned geographer [Strabo], in alluding to the tradition that Sicily had been separated by a convulsion from Italy, remarks, that at present the land near the sea in those parts was rarely shaken by earthquakes, since there were now open orifices whereby fire and ignited matters and waters escaped; but formerly, when the volcanoes of Etna, the Lipari Islands, Ischia, and others, were closed up, the imprisoned fire and wind might have produced far more vehement movements. The doctrine, therefore, that volcanoes are safety valves, and that the subterranean convulsions are probably most violent when first the volcanic energy shifts itself to a new quarter, is not modern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link=wikiquote:Charles Lyell||first=Charles |last=Lyell|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesgeolo01unkngoog |title=Principles of Geology|date=1832|pp=20-21|publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The very first written definition/discussion on the fossil formation (mentioning [[Nummulite]] quoted from [[Celâl Şengör|A.M. Celâl Şengör]]).

''One extraordinary thing which I saw at the pyramids must not be omitted. Heaps of stones from the quarries lie in front of the pyramids. Among these are found pieces which in shape and size resemble lentils. Some contain substances like grains half peeled. These, it is said, are the remnants of the workmen's food converted into stone; which is not probable. For at home in our country (Amasia), there is a long hill in a plain, which abounds with pebbles of a porus stone, resembling lentils. The pebbles of the sea-shore and of rivers suggest somewhat of the same difficulty [respecting their origin]; some explanation may indeed be found in the motion [to which these are subject] in flowing waters, but the investigation of the above fact presents more difficulty. I have said elsewhere, that in sight of the pyramids, on the other side in Arabia, and near the stone quarries from which they are built, is a very rocky mountain, called the Trojan mountain; beneath it there are caves, and near the caves and the river a village called Troy, an ancient settlement of the captive Trojans who had accompanied Menelaus and settled there.''&lt;ref name="StraboGeogVIII"&gt;{{cite book|author=Strabo|title=Geography|translator=Horace Leonard Jones||volume=Vol. VIII Book XVII|section=34|page=95|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.57232/2015.57232.Geography-Of-Strabo-Vol-8#page/n99/search/Menelaus|publisher =William Heinemann|location=London|date=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first written definition/discussion of volcanism ([[effusive eruption]]) observed at [[Katakekaumenē]] (modern Kula, Western Turkey) until [[Pliny the Younger]] witnessed to the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius|Vesuvius]] on 24 August AD&amp;nbsp;79 in [[Pompeii]]:

[[File:Kula karadivlit scoriacone aaflow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Karadivlit [[Scoria]] Cone and AA type basaltic fissure lava flow in [[Katakekaumenē]] (modern-day [[Kula, Manisa|Kula]], Turkey).]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... There are no trees here, but only the vineyards where they produce the Katakekaumene wines which are by no means inferior from any of the wines famous for their quality. The soil is covered with ashes, and black in color as if the mountainous and rocky country was made up of fires. Some assume that these ashes were the result of thunderbolts and sub-terranean explosions, and do not doubt that the legendary story of [[Typhon]] takes place in this region. Ksanthos adds that the king of this region was a man called Arimus. However, it is not reasonable to accept that the whole country was burned down at a time as a result of such an event rather than as a result of a fire bursting from underground whose source has now died out. Three pits are called "Physas" and separated by forty stadia from each other. Above these pits, there are hills formed by the hot masses burst out from the ground as estimated by a logical reasoning. Such type of soil is very convenient for viniculture, just like the Katanasoil which is covered with ashes and where the best wines are still produced abundantly. Some writers concluded by looking at these places that there is a good reason for calling Dionysus by the name ("Phrygenes")''&lt;ref name="StraboGeogVI"&gt;{{cite book|author=Strabo|title=Geography|translator=Horace Leonard Jones||volume=Vol. VI Book XIII | section=11 | page=183|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.gov.ignca.2918/2918#page/n191/search/Dionysus+|publisher =William Heinemann|location=London|date=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ascension Island does not share the same country code ([[+290]]) with the rest of [[St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha|St Helena]].

==Calling formats==
To call in [[Ascension Island]], the following format is used:

'''yxxxx'''      Calls inside Ascension Island

'''+247 yxxxx'''  Calls from outside Ascension Island

==Ascension Island numbering plan==
According to ITU Communication of 08.V.2015, Sure South Atlantic Limited, Jamestown, announced the following update to the numbering plan for Ascension.

The length of geographical numbers increased from four (4) to five (5) digits and prefixed with the number "6".

The 4XXXX range  reserved for mobile services.

The change to five-digit numbering to be implemented on 1 June 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="967">A '''till plain''' is an extensive flat [[plain]] of [[glacial till]] that forms when a sheet of [[ice]] becomes detached from the main body of a [[glacier]] and melts in place, depositing the [[sediment]]s it carried. [[Moraine#Ground moraines|Ground moraines]] are formed when the till melts out of the glacier in irregular heaps, forming rolling hills.

Till plains created by the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] cover much of northern [[Ohio]] (see [[Glacial till plains (Ohio)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Simonson, Bruce. "Geology of the Vermilion River Watershed."

Under the treaty, each power received the right to take military action in the face of any threat to the constitution. Cyprus became independent of foreign rule. The Greek Cypriot [[Archbishop Makarios]] became the first president, with Turkish Cypriot Dr. Kutchuk his vice president. Both had the right of [[veto]]. Turkish Cypriots, who formed 18% of the population, were guaranteed the vice-presidency, three out of ten ministerial posts and 30% of jobs in the public service.  They were further guaranteed 40% representation in the army and separate municipal services in the five major towns. Overall, a very complex constitution was drafted, which demanded a majority of votes overall as well as within each community for many decisions.
|-

Inter-communal fighting erupted. Tylliria was bombarded with napalm bombs. A [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UN Peace Keeping Force]] was sent in, but soon proved powerless to prevent incidents. Thousands of Turkish Cypriots retreated into enclaves where they were embargoed by the Greek Cypriots. The UN attempted to supply them with food and medicine. [[Akritas plan]]

'''Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun''' (25 November 1816 – 13 July 1889) was a French [[geographer]] and [[cartographer]].

==Biography==

He was born in Paris, France, the son of [[Conrad Malte-Brun]], another geographer, of [[Denmark|Danish]] origin, and founder of the ''[[Société de Géographie]]''. After having been professor of history in several colleges, he devoted himself especially to geographical studies.&lt;ref name=ac&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Malte-Brun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun became a member of the ''Société de Géographie'', and quickly rose to be its secretary-general. He was also principal editor of the ''Nouvelles Annales des Voyage''.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

He died in [[Marcoussis]] in the [[Essonne]] ''[[département in France|département]]'' and is buried in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]] in Paris.

==Legacy==

His name was given to the street in Marcoussis where he once lived.

Mount [[Malte Brun (mountain)|Malte-Brun]] in [[New Zealand's]] [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] was named, by Sir [[Julius von Haast]], after him.

[[File:Henrican navigation routes.gif|thumb|250px|Atlantic winds (green), currents (blue) and approximate Portuguese sailing routes (red) during [[Henry the Navigator]]'s (c.1430-1460) lifetime. The further south ships went, the wider off sailing required to return]]

'''"Volta do mar"''', '''"volta do mar largo"''' or '''"volta do largo"''', (the phrase in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] means literally ''turn of the sea'' but also ''return from the sea'') is a navigational technique perfected by [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] navigators during the [[Age of Discovery]] in the late fifteenth century, using the dependable phenomenon of the great permanent wind circle, the [[North Atlantic Gyre]]. This was a major step in the [[history of navigation]], when an understanding of [[Winds in the Age of Sail|winds in the age of sail]] was crucial to success: the European [[Thalassocracy|sea empires]] would never have been established had the Europeans not figured out how the [[trade wind]]s worked.

== History ==
===Portuguese discovery in the Atlantic Ocean===
The ''volta do mar'' was a sailing technique discovered in successfully returning from the [[Macaronesia|Atlantic islands]], where the pilot first had to sail far to the west in order to catch usable following winds, and return to Europe.  This was a counter-intuitive sailing direction, as it required the pilot to steer in a direction that was perpendicular to the ports of [[Portugal]].  Lack of this information may have doomed the thirteenth-century expedition of [[Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi]], who were headed towards the as yet unknown [[Canary Islands]] and were lost; once there, without understanding the Atlantic gyre and the ''volta do mar'', they would have been unable to beat upwind to the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and home. Discovering this technique was crucial for returning from future [[age of discovery|discoveries]]; for example [[Christopher Columbus]] would never have returned from America without applying the ''volta do mar'' by sailing northwards from the [[Caribbean]] through the [[Horse Latitudes]] to catch the prevailing mid-latitude [[westerlies]]. 

Similarly in the South Atlantic with the exception that the South Atlantic gyre circulates counterclockwise.  As India-bound Portuguese explorers and traders crossed the [[equator]] with the intention of passing the entire western coast of Africa, their voyages took them far to the West (in the vicinity of [[Brazil]].)


===Application to the Pacific Ocean - the Manila Galleon===
[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|left|Map of the five major ocean gyres]]
[[File:Andres Urdaneta Tornaviaje.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Route from Philippines to Acapulco, México]]
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|250px|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and the Spanish trade routes (white). Portuguese ships went almost to Brazil before rounding Africa and to the Azores before turning east to Lisbon. The Spanish [[Manila galleons]] used the northern Trade winds going west and the westerlies going east.]]
The route of the [[Manila Galleon]] from [[Manila]] to [[Acapulco]] depended upon successful application of the Atlantic phenomenon to the [[Pacific ocean]]: in discovering the [[North Pacific Gyre]], captains of returning galleons had to reach the latitudes of [[Japan]] before they could safely cross. The discovery, upon which the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade was based was owing to the Spanish [[Andres de Urdaneta|Andrés de Urdaneta]], who, sailing in convoy under [[Miguel López de Legazpi]], discovered the return route  in 1565: the fleet split up, some heading south, but Urdaneta reasoned that the trade winds of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the ''Volta do mar'' to the west to pick up winds that would bring them back from [[Madeira]], then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to the [[History of the west coast of North America|west coast of North America]]. Though he sailed to [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North]] before turning east, his hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], [[California]], then followed the coast south to [[Acapulco]]. Most of his crew died on the long initial voyage, for which they had not sufficiently provisioned.

Historically, some browsers could gain support via the [[Google Gears]] [[plug-in (computing)|plugin]], but this was discontinued in 2010 and the server-side API it depended on stopped responding in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_geolocation.html |title=Geolocation API: Gears API: Google Code |date=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://code.google.com/p/gears/wiki/GeolocationAPI GeolocationAPI - gears - Provides the geolocation of a device running a Gears-enabled web browser. - Improving Your Web Browser - Google Project Hosting]. Code.google.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geolocation API is ideally suited to web applications for mobile devices such as [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDA) and [[smartphone]]s. On desktop computers, the W3C Geolocation API works in [[Firefox]] since version 3.5, [[Google Chrome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/05/new-chrome-stable-release-welcome-mac.html |title=A new Chrome stable release: Welcome, Mac and Linux! |date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] 10.6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2010/07/01/opera-10-60-goes-final |title=Opera 10.60 goes final |first=Huib |last=Kleinhout |date=1 July 2010 |work=[[My Opera]] |publisher=[[Opera Software]] |accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet Explorer]] 9.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W3C Geolocation API in IE9|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/02/17/w3c-geolocation-api-in-ie9.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Safari 5. On mobile devices, it works on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (firmware 2.0+), [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Windows Phone]] and [[Maemo]]. The W3C Geolocation API is also supported by Opera Mobile 10.1 — available for Android and [[Symbian]] devices (S60 generations 3 &amp; 5) since November 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2010/11/24/|author=Opera.com|title=Opera Mobile 10.1 for Nokia smartphones goes final |date=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google Gears]] provided geolocation support for older and non-compliant browsers, including Internet Explorer 7.0+ as a Gears plugin, and Google Chrome which implemented Gears natively. It also supported geolocation on mobile devices as a plugin for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] browser (pre version 2.0) and [[Opera Mobile]] for [[Windows Mobile]]. However, the Google Gears Geolocation API is incompatible with the W3C Geolocation API and is no longer supported.

==Features==
The result of W3C Geolocation API will usually give 4 location properties, including latitude and longitude (coordinates), altitude (height), and [accuracy of the position gathered], which all depend on the location sources.  In some queries, altitude may yield or return no value.

==Location Sources==
The Geolocation API does not provide the location information. The location information is obtained by a device (such as a smartphone, PC or modem), which is then served by the API to be brought in browser. Usually geolocation will try to determine a device's position using one of these several methods.

;GPS (Global Positioning System): This happens for any device which has [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] capabilities. A smartphone with GPS capabilities and set to high accuracy mode will be likely to obtain the location data from this. GPS calculate location information from the satellite signal. It has the highest accuracy; in most Android smartphones, the accuracy can be up to 10 metres.
;Mobile Network Location: [[Mobile phone tracking]] is used if a cellphone or wireless modem is used without a GPS chip built in.
;WiFi Positioning System: If WiFi is used indoors, a [[Wi-Fi positioning system]] is the likeliest source. Some WiFi spots have location services capabilities.
;IP Address Location: Location is detected based on nearest Public IP Address on a device (which can be a computer, the router it is connected to, or the ISP the router uses). The location depends on the IP information available, but in many cases where the IP is hidden behind Internet Service Provider NAT, the accuracy is only to the level of a city, region or even country.

==Implementation==
Though the implementation is not specified, W3C Geolocation API is built on extant technologies, and is heavily influenced by Google Gears Geolocation API. Example: Firefox's Geolocation implementation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/geolocation/ |title=Location-Aware Browsing |work=Mozilla Firefox |publisher=Mozilla}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses Google's network location provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/apis/gears/geolocation_network_protocol.html |title=Geolocation API Network Protocol: Gears API |work=Google Code |publisher=Google |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Gears Geolocation works by sending a set of parameters that could give a hint as to where the user's physical location is to a network location provider server, which is by default the one provided by Google (code.l.google.com).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webscannotes.com/?page_id=425 |title=WebScanNotes.com: W3C Geolocation API |work=WebScanNotes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the parameters are lists of sensed mobile cell towers and Wi-Fi networks, all with sensed signal strengths. These parameters are encapsulated into a JavaScript Object Notation ([[JSON]]) message and sent to the network location provider via HTTP POST. Based on these parameters, the network location provider can calculate the location.  Common uses for this location information include enforcing access controls, localizing and customizing content, analyzing traffic, [[contextual advertising]] and preventing identity theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=1622411 |title=Personal Jurisdiction, Internet Commerce, and Privacy: The Pervasive Legal Consequences of Modern Geolocation Technologies |first=Kevin F. |last=King |date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example code===
Simple [[JavaScript]] code that checks if the browser has the Geolocation API implemented and then uses it to get the current position of the device. this code creates a function which can be called on html using &lt;code&gt;&lt;body onload="geoFindMe()"&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
const geoFindMe = () =&gt; {
    if (navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, error, geoOptions);
    } else {
        console.log("Geolocation services are not supported by your web browser.");
    }
}

const success = (position) =&gt; {
    const latitude = position.coords.latitude;
    const longitude = position.coords.longitude;
    const altitude = position.coords.altitude;
    const accuracy = position.coords.accuracy;
    console.log(`lat: ${latitude} long: ${longitude}`);
}

const error = (error) =&gt; {
    console.log(`Unable to retrieve your location due to ${error.code}: ${error.message}`);
}

const geoOptions = {
    enableHighAccuracy: true,
    maximumAge: 30000,
    timeout: 27000
};
&lt;/source&gt;
